00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.320
Does absence make the
heart grow fonder?

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.894
New science says dating long
distance might make a better

00:00:05.894 --> 00:00:06.435
relationship.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.780
Hey distance daters,
welcome to "D News."

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.238
Trace here with
the science lowdown

00:00:16.238 --> 00:00:19.110
on the dreaded long distance
relationship, or LDR.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.060
Three million Americans
are part of an LDR.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.760
25% to 50% of college students
are currently in one right now.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.410
Of the non-college
group, reasons

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.750
could be military
deployment, work preferences

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.980
or requirements, internet
dating, and even immigration

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.120
and visa delays.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.847
The internet helps
us feel closer,

00:00:34.847 --> 00:00:35.930
even when we're far apart.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.560
So long distance relationships
are growing in popularity.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.290
Technology like text
messaging, instant messaging,

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.760
video chat, they all help
us feel a sense of inclusion

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.320
and intimacy that
we wouldn't have

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.380
been able to get only
10 or 15 years ago.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.460
The research from
2010 says romance

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.340
does kind of require
face to face interaction.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.790
Newer research, that's
saying the opposite.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.250
A study in the Journal of
Sex and Marital Therapy

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.330
says, those in long
distance relationships

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.470
might actually be
better at dating.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.207
Researchers recruited people
in close by and long distance

00:01:05.207 --> 00:01:07.540
relationships, who filled out
a series of questionnaires

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.720
tackling their intimacy,
their commitment,

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.140
their communication,
psychological distress,

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.080
and sexual satisfaction,
or lack thereof.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.866
Those in an LDR also
indicated how often

00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:18.990
they got to see each other.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.660
Though both groups
were doing well,

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.430
the LDR couples were
better functioning couples,

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.920
reporting higher levels
of satisfaction, intimacy,

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.700
and communication.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.670
The close by couples win in
the area of getting laid more.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.520
Basically, LDR couples
have to replace

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.879
their physical closeness
with emotional closeness.

00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:36.670
While the close by
couples were overlooking

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.753
some of their problems,
the long distance couples,

00:01:38.753 --> 00:01:41.140
they were forced
to sort them out.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.380
A piece in Pacific
Magazine puts it this way.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.500
"Long distance couples
are arguably better

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.870
at discussing sex, and
those who live nearby

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.134
actually have more sex."

00:01:52.134 --> 00:01:54.550
A separate study this year in
the Journal of Communication

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.130
tipped the scales even farther
toward long distance couples,

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.730
indicating that they
form even deeper bonds

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.040
than their nearby
neighbors because of all

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.100
of that sharing,
something those of us who

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.680
are very familiar with
the long distance thing,

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.680
as my friends call
it, know very well,

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.160
because you're just
always talking,

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.612
you're just talking and talking,
and there's more talking

00:02:12.612 --> 00:02:13.820
and some talking and talking.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.236
In the end, all
this communication

00:02:15.236 --> 00:02:17.860
leads to a greater sense
of mental intimacy, which

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.780
is great, if lonely.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.620
Psychotherapist and
author, Rachel Sussman,

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.161
points out the loneliness factor
isn't really considered much

00:02:24.161 --> 00:02:27.030
in this research, but it can
be really stressful for people,

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.520
which is a good point.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.110
Also, they don't really
consider the jealousy factor.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.140
If you're a jealous person
with a high level of FOMO,

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.052
things could go sour, fast.

00:02:36.052 --> 00:02:37.760
"Lifehacker" has a
couple of helpful tips

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.100
to make LDR last, like
make date nights, where

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.830
you video chat,
eat dinner, watch

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.260
a movie, text things
like "wish you were here"

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.660
to alleviate jealousy.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.340
And when you talk, be present.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.830
Non-verbal cues are
really important.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.450
Most importantly,
have an end date.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.040
If there is no
end to the tunnel,

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.060
then there's no light
to look forward to.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.745
What if some of the most
famous relationships were LDRs?

00:03:01.745 --> 00:03:03.860
I wonder how like
Mary Todd Lincoln

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.085
would have tolerated
Abe's a brutal honesty?

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.740
The word "independence"
may have no A's in it.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.485
The declaration
may have no holes.

00:03:16.485 --> 00:03:19.090
But when you look at the
people who signed it,

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.820
there are a lot of a-holes.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.565
That guy just does
not hold back.

00:03:24.565 --> 00:03:26.940
Anyway, be sure to check out
brutally honest Abe for more

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.569
of his delightful truth bombs.

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.610

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.280
