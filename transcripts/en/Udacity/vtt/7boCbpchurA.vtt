00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.330
So for quite a long time,
people built portfolios this way.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.390
They would look at a bunch of assets,
essentially equally weight them,

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.440
and end up with a portfolio that
behaved somewhat in between.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.370
Now, if you wanted a low-risk portfolio,

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:21.350
you should focus on assets
that are low risk out here.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.400
If you wanted, for
instance, high return,

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.480
you should focus on assets over here.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.250
In both those cases you would end
up with a portfolio, say, here, or

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.370
a portfolio, say, here.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:35.560
Now, can we do better?

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.710
In other words, is it possible
to get portfolios over here?

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.860
So can we have a portfolio here
that has a return similar to

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.430
these assets over here, but
risk similar to these assets over here?

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.040
Indeed we can, and
it's due to a man named Harry Markowitz,

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.300
who won the Nobel Prize for his insight.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.620
What he discovered, and
what people had been overlooking,

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.890
was the relationship between
stocks in terms of covariance.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.380
So the resulting
performance of a portfolio,

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.740
especially in terms of risk,
is not just a factor, or

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.690
a blend of the various risks, but it has
to do with how they interact day to day.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.210
So indeed, if we pick the right
stocks in the right proportions,

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.740
we can get a portfolio that
performs over here, that in fact,

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.970
can have lower risk than any
of the individual assets,

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.830
and I'll show you how to
do that in just a moment.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:36.590
Now before I do that,

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.220
I want to mention though one other
thing about Harry Markowitz.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.040
Up until the time of his discovery,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.650
most people viewed bonds
as the lowest risk asset,

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.720
in other words, if you wanted low risk,
you should use bonds orly.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.270
Markowitz showed that
a blend of stocks and

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.970
bonds is actually lower risk than
either one of those by themselves.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.630
And I'll show you how that
makes sense in a moment.
