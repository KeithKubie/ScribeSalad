00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:05.038
so I took some questions
on the Internet recently,

00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:06.973
and, uh, some people
were upset about a show

00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:08.674
I did back in September.
Now, that didn't

00:00:08.707 --> 00:00:09.942
necessarily surprise me,
because we tackle

00:00:09.975 --> 00:00:11.611
a lot of difficult subjects
on this show.

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:14.547
I mean, the second show we did
was about Bill Cosby's

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.117
"alleged even though I think
he really did it" raping.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.487
That's right, I haven't
forgotten about you, (bleep).

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.490
I have not.
Still... still in here.

00:00:24.523 --> 00:00:26.526
But we talked about...
I mean, we talked about

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:27.894
cops killing unarmed black kids,

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:29.295
the mistreatment of women,

00:00:29.328 --> 00:00:31.297
I mean, the Flint water crisis.
I get it.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.299
These are topics-- they're gonna
stir up some controversy.

00:00:33.332 --> 00:00:36.402
So, anyhow, um,
so on this particular date,

00:00:36.435 --> 00:00:38.104
we were talking about,
uh, water on Mars,

00:00:38.137 --> 00:00:40.473
and understandably,
some people got very upset.

00:00:40.506 --> 00:00:43.643
Uh... They thought...

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:47.346
they thought we disrespected
and kept interrupting our guest,

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.515
scientist Bill Nye.
And a couple commenters

00:00:49.548 --> 00:00:51.584
even accused me
of being anti-science.

00:00:51.617 --> 00:00:54.487
Listen, guys,
I love science, okay?

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.190
When I was a kid, I mean,
I wanted to be an astronaut.

00:00:57.223 --> 00:01:00.359
I still wear science pajamas.

00:01:00.392 --> 00:01:02.328
I do.

00:01:02.361 --> 00:01:04.697
Not many guys
can pull that look off.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.401
But I am-I am fascinated
by discoveries of all kind.

00:01:08.434 --> 00:01:11.304
And I love it when I see kids
interested in science.

00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:13.272
The-the last thing
I would ever want to do

00:01:13.305 --> 00:01:16.409
is be disrespectful
of a guy who loves science.

00:01:16.442 --> 00:01:19.045
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm a blerd. I am a black nerd.

00:01:19.078 --> 00:01:20.646
I love... Right?

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:24.083
I love science, I love Bill Nye.
Love me some Bill Nye.

00:01:24.116 --> 00:01:26.919
-(cheering, applause) -I love,
uh, sci... scientific...

00:01:26.952 --> 00:01:28.287
-Oh, my God! Oh!
-Hey.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.022
-Hey, it's Bill Nye.
-Good to see you.

00:01:30.055 --> 00:01:33.726
Bill Nye, everybody!
Have a seat, Bill.

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.929
Oh, my God.

00:01:36.962 --> 00:01:39.966
It is Bill Nye.
Bill, um...

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:42.768
I don't know if you heard
wh-what I was just saying. Uh...

00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:44.403
Oh, I heard you,
Larry. I heard it

00:01:44.436 --> 00:01:47.306
-through the science
of television. -Oh.

00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:49.509
A-And not only that,
I was... I was, uh,

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:51.377
-standing right over there.
-Yeah, of course, yeah. Yeah,

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.913
-yeah. Science of proximity
is what that was. -Yeah.

00:01:53.946 --> 00:01:55.548
Okay, now, Bill,
when you were here,

00:01:55.581 --> 00:01:57.450
I mean, you didn't feel
disrespected, did you?

00:01:57.483 --> 00:02:00.086 line:0%
Larry, Larry,
it's a comedy show.

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.021 line:0%
You're thinking about this
too much.

00:02:02.054 --> 00:02:04.690 line:0%
-Let me put this
in scientific terms. -Okay.

00:02:04.723 --> 00:02:08.361
Haters gonna hate.

00:02:08.394 --> 00:02:09.862
You...

00:02:09.895 --> 00:02:10.930
Larry...

00:02:10.963 --> 00:02:14.934
you just got to let
that (bleep) go.

00:02:14.967 --> 00:02:18.204
Hey...
those are scientific terms?

00:02:18.237 --> 00:02:21.107
-Yes.
I am quoting Copernicus. -Oh.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.177
"Let that (bleep) go."
He really said that.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.646
-But... but it was in Latin.
-I know.

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:29.348
-It was in Latin. -He-he
said it in Latin originally,

00:02:29.381 --> 00:02:31.350
but it translates
to "let that (bleep) go."

00:02:31.383 --> 00:02:33.052
Okay, great.
Okay, great, I just wanted...

00:02:33.085 --> 00:02:35.121
So we've cleared the air?
'Cause, I mean, people thought

00:02:35.154 --> 00:02:37.523
we were interrupting you,
not letting you speak, I mean...

00:02:37.556 --> 00:02:40.193
-Larry, there's no air to clear.
We're good. -Okay. Great.

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:42.461
In fact, actually, you know,

00:02:42.494 --> 00:02:44.797
since I'm here, there is
one more thing I wanted

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.699
to mention about water on Mars.
You know, there are

00:02:46.732 --> 00:02:48.701
-these weeping craters, and
there's also -Oh, sorry, Bill.

00:02:48.734 --> 00:02:49.702
-ice in the polar...
-We don't have any more time.

00:02:49.735 --> 00:02:50.703
Bill Nye, everybody!

00:02:50.736 --> 00:02:51.971
That's all from Bill Nye!

00:02:52.004 --> 00:02:53.973
Thanks a lot for coming, Bill!
That's so nice!

00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:55.508
-We got to go. Bill Nye,
everybody! -That's all?

00:02:55.541 --> 00:02:58.044
Give him a nice hand! But we got
to go! We don't have any time!

00:02:58.077 --> 00:03:01.410
Bill Nye! So nice of him
to come out. Thanks, Bill!
