I think about food and categories I

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:11.530
I think about food and categories I
 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.110
I think about food and categories I
think it's important that we eat a

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:13.120
think it's important that we eat a
 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.990
think it's important that we eat a
balanced diet and that means lots of

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.000
balanced diet and that means lots of
 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.160
balanced diet and that means lots of
fruits vegetables and whole grains

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.170
fruits vegetables and whole grains
 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.620
fruits vegetables and whole grains
everybody knows that diets that are

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630
everybody knows that diets that are
 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.620
everybody knows that diets that are
based on those are associated with good

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630
based on those are associated with good
 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.570
based on those are associated with good
health and then meat and dairy if you

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580
health and then meat and dairy if you
 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.480
health and then meat and dairy if you
eat meat and dairy products you just

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490
eat meat and dairy products you just
 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.429
eat meat and dairy products you just
want to eat a lot of different kinds of

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:29.439
want to eat a lot of different kinds of
 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.400
want to eat a lot of different kinds of
foods I don't think there's any one food

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410
foods I don't think there's any one food
 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.380
foods I don't think there's any one food
that anybody needs I can't think of a

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390
that anybody needs I can't think of a
 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.680
that anybody needs I can't think of a
single food that a single single food

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690
single food that a single single food
 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.530
single food that a single single food
that is absolutely essential if you look

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540
that is absolutely essential if you look
 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.560
that is absolutely essential if you look
at human diets across the entire world

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570
at human diets across the entire world
 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.860
at human diets across the entire world
you see the diets very enormous Lee and

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870
you see the diets very enormous Lee and
 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.349
you see the diets very enormous Lee and
depend on what's available locally so

00:00:51.349 --> 00:00:51.359
depend on what's available locally so
 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:54.450
depend on what's available locally so
the whole business about you need to eat

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460
the whole business about you need to eat
 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.099
the whole business about you need to eat
this food or you shouldn't eat that food

00:00:56.099 --> 00:00:56.109
this food or you shouldn't eat that food
 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:57.689
this food or you shouldn't eat that food
that's all about marketing it's not

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699
that's all about marketing it's not
 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:02.630
that's all about marketing it's not
about health

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640
 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.780
scientists have tried for decades to

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790
scientists have tried for decades to
 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.490
scientists have tried for decades to
find something wrong with caffeine and

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500
find something wrong with caffeine and
 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.399
find something wrong with caffeine and
they can't no matter how hard they try

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409
they can't no matter how hard they try
 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.620
they can't no matter how hard they try
we metabolize caffeine

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630
we metabolize caffeine
 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.600
we metabolize caffeine
some of us metabolize it better than

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610
some of us metabolize it better than
 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.540
some of us metabolize it better than
others I happen to be a fast metabolizer

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550
others I happen to be a fast metabolizer
 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.020
others I happen to be a fast metabolizer
so it doesn't affect me at all unless I

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030
so it doesn't affect me at all unless I
 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.910
so it doesn't affect me at all unless I
have really a lot of it but for people

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920
have really a lot of it but for people
 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.280
have really a lot of it but for people
who are sensitive to caffeine they know

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290
who are sensitive to caffeine they know
 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.380
who are sensitive to caffeine they know
it they know that if they eat something

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390
it they know that if they eat something
 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.510
it they know that if they eat something
that's got caffeine in it they get jumpy

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520
that's got caffeine in it they get jumpy
 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.030
that's got caffeine in it they get jumpy
and shaky and they don't like the way it

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040
and shaky and they don't like the way it
 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.999
and shaky and they don't like the way it
feels so they cut back on it but if

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009
feels so they cut back on it but if
 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.190
feels so they cut back on it but if
you're not really consuming huge

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200
you're not really consuming huge
 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.900
you're not really consuming huge
quantities it doesn't have very much of

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910
quantities it doesn't have very much of
 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.969
quantities it doesn't have very much of
an effect I don't think it's so good for

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979
an effect I don't think it's so good for
 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.410
an effect I don't think it's so good for
kids and certainly teachers in school

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420
kids and certainly teachers in school
 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.609
kids and certainly teachers in school
complain a lot that if the kids are

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619
complain a lot that if the kids are
 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.830
complain a lot that if the kids are
highly caffeinated they're bouncing off

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840
highly caffeinated they're bouncing off
 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.900
highly caffeinated they're bouncing off
the walls and it makes it harder for the

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910
the walls and it makes it harder for the
 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.359
the walls and it makes it harder for the
kids to concentrate and harder for them

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369
kids to concentrate and harder for them
 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.510
kids to concentrate and harder for them
to do their work so that would be the

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520
to do their work so that would be the
 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.760
to do their work so that would be the
main thing but what really bothers me

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770
main thing but what really bothers me
 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.219
main thing but what really bothers me
about it is it's not labeled I think it

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229
about it is it's not labeled I think it
 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.020
about it is it's not labeled I think it
ought to be labeled on food products and

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030
ought to be labeled on food products and
 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.999
ought to be labeled on food products and
on drinks so and then people have a

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009
on drinks so and then people have a
 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.350
on drinks so and then people have a
choice right now they don't have a

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360
choice right now they don't have a
 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.790
choice right now they don't have a
choice

down on our salt intake
 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:01.839
down on our salt intake
we don't need nearly as much as we're

we don't need nearly as much as we're

we don't need nearly as much as we're

choice about it it's either in the
 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.220
choice about it it's either in the
processed food that we buy in the store

would be really terrific if we could cut

would be really terrific if we could cut

would be really terrific if we could cut
down on our salt intake

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330
down on our salt intake
 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.120
down on our salt intake
we don't need nearly as much as we're

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130
we don't need nearly as much as we're
 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.730
we don't need nearly as much as we're
eating and the real problem with it is

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740
eating and the real problem with it is
 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.759
eating and the real problem with it is
that nearly 80% of the salt in American

that nearly 80% of the salt in American

processed food that we buy in the store
 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.960

to do something about that at the policy

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550
to do something about that at the policy
 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.090
to do something about that at the policy
level so that restaurants and processed

level so that restaurants and processed
foods will cut down on the soul and make

foods will cut down on the soul and make
 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.650
foods will cut down on the soul and make
it easier for people to eat less

manufacturers and restaurants to cut
 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.260
manufacturers and restaurants to cut
down New York City for example has a

very quiet under-the-table initiative to
 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.270
very quiet under-the-table initiative to
try to get the salt and you see the

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280
try to get the salt and you see the
 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.100
try to get the salt and you see the
problem with salt is that if you're

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110
problem with salt is that if you're
 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.650
problem with salt is that if you're
eating a lot of it you don't notice the

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660
eating a lot of it you don't notice the
 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:13.580
eating a lot of it you don't notice the
taste of it

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590
taste of it
 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.380
taste of it
you only notice the taste of it if

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390
you only notice the taste of it if
 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.510
you only notice the taste of it if
you're not eating a lot of it and so if

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520
you're not eating a lot of it and so if
 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.760
you're not eating a lot of it and so if
everybody in the population was eating

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770
everybody in the population was eating
 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.640
everybody in the population was eating
less then the foods that are out there

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650
less then the foods that are out there
 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.790
less then the foods that are out there
would taste terribly salty but unless

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800
would taste terribly salty but unless
 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.370
would taste terribly salty but unless
all of the food manufacturers and all of

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380
all of the food manufacturers and all of
 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.050
all of the food manufacturers and all of
the restaurants cut down at the same

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060
the restaurants cut down at the same
 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.680
the restaurants cut down at the same
time then nobody wants to go first so

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690
time then nobody wants to go first so
 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.060
time then nobody wants to go first so
that's really what the problem is that's

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070
that's really what the problem is that's
 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.190
that's really what the problem is that's
why you need government intervention in

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.200
why you need government intervention in
 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.410
why you need government intervention in

this to try to make it easier for people

this to try to make it easier for people
to cut down on their salt intake because

to cut down on their salt intake because
 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:47.400
to cut down on their salt intake because
even if you want to it's really hard

that but the animals the definition is
 

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.170
that but the animals the definition is
also quite precise the animals have to

also quite precise the animals have to
 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.840
also quite precise the animals have to
be raised on organic feed they have to

be raised on organic feed they have to

and so for this the rules are very long

and so for this the rules are very long
and to the and those in the places that

and to the and those in the places that

and to the and those in the places that
produce those organic animals or plants

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:38.830
produce those organic animals or plants
 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.880
produce those organic animals or plants
are inspected to make sure that they're

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:41.890
are inspected to make sure that they're
 

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:44.370
are inspected to make sure that they're
following the rules so that's that

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:44.380
following the rules so that's that
 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.520
following the rules so that's that
system and to the extent that it works

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:47.530
system and to the extent that it works
 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.260
system and to the extent that it works
it works pretty well most people think

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.270
it works pretty well most people think
 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.420
it works pretty well most people think
it works pretty well and there's not an

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.430
it works pretty well and there's not an
 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.550
it works pretty well and there's not an
enormous amount of cheating going on

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:53.560
enormous amount of cheating going on
 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.860
enormous amount of cheating going on
because of the inspection system and

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:55.870
because of the inspection system and
 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:59.700
because of the inspection system and
because the organic producers know what

00:06:59.700 --> 00:06:59.710
because the organic producers know what
 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.140
because the organic producers know what
the other ones are doing and so they

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:01.150
the other ones are doing and so they
 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.690
the other ones are doing and so they
turn each other in if there's a problem

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:03.700
turn each other in if there's a problem
 

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.700
turn each other in if there's a problem
there's not a lot of cheating going on

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:05.710
there's not a lot of cheating going on
 

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:08.280
there's not a lot of cheating going on
but with that said a lot of people feel

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:08.290
but with that said a lot of people feel
 

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:10.080
but with that said a lot of people feel
that the organic rules are not strong

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:10.090
that the organic rules are not strong
 

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.480
that the organic rules are not strong
enough that they really don't deal in

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:12.490
enough that they really don't deal in
 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.540
enough that they really don't deal in
particular with the ability of animals

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:15.550
particular with the ability of animals
 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.060
particular with the ability of animals
to be outdoors just because they have

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:18.070
to be outdoors just because they have
 

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.820
to be outdoors just because they have
access to the outdoors doesn't mean they

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:20.830
access to the outdoors doesn't mean they
 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.340
access to the outdoors doesn't mean they
are actually afterwards that's a big

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:23.350
are actually afterwards that's a big
 

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:26.520
are actually afterwards that's a big
loophole and also there's no requirement

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:26.530
loophole and also there's no requirement
 

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.190
loophole and also there's no requirement
for sustainability so you can have

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:29.200
for sustainability so you can have
 

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.250
for sustainability so you can have
industrial organic agriculture that is

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:32.260
industrial organic agriculture that is
 

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.220
industrial organic agriculture that is
just as devastating to land sea and air

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:35.230
just as devastating to land sea and air
 

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:38.660
just as devastating to land sea and air
and climate as industrial anything else

and climate as industrial anything else
 

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:41.730
and climate as industrial anything else
and that's I think a problem I think the

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:41.740
and that's I think a problem I think the
 

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.770
and that's I think a problem I think the
Department of Agriculture is looking at

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:43.780
Department of Agriculture is looking at
 

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.740
Department of Agriculture is looking at
ways to strengthen the organic rules and

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:46.750
ways to strengthen the organic rules and
 

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:48.990
ways to strengthen the organic rules and
ways to make sure that they're kept

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:49.000
ways to make sure that they're kept
 

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.189
ways to make sure that they're kept
honest

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:55.180
diets you raise questions about one
vitamin and that's vitamin b12 because

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:55.190
vitamin and that's vitamin b12 because
 

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:57.490
vitamin and that's vitamin b12 because
that only comes from products of animal

00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:57.500
that only comes from products of animal
 

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:01.600
that only comes from products of animal
origin or bacterially fermented foods so

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:01.610
origin or bacterially fermented foods so
 

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:02.830
origin or bacterially fermented foods so
you have to make sure that you've got a

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:02.840
you have to make sure that you've got a
 

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.980
you have to make sure that you've got a
source of vitamin b12 in your diet and

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:05.990
source of vitamin b12 in your diet and
 

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:07.570
source of vitamin b12 in your diet and
that you're eating a variety of foods

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:07.580
that you're eating a variety of foods
 

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:10.390
that you're eating a variety of foods
but other than that I just don't see it

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:10.400
but other than that I just don't see it
 

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:14.050
but other than that I just don't see it
as an issue at all except for kids for

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:14.060
as an issue at all except for kids for
 

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:15.940
as an issue at all except for kids for
small children and sometimes hard for

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:15.950
small children and sometimes hard for
 

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:18.280
small children and sometimes hard for
children to get enough calories unless

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:18.290
children to get enough calories unless
 

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:20.260
children to get enough calories unless
they're getting enough fat in with the

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:20.270
they're getting enough fat in with the
 

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:22.990
they're getting enough fat in with the
vegan diets that they're getting but

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:23.000
vegan diets that they're getting but
 

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.540
vegan diets that they're getting but
parents vegan parents know how to deal

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:25.550
parents vegan parents know how to deal
 

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:29.170
parents vegan parents know how to deal
with that most of them and do a pretty

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:29.180
with that most of them and do a pretty
 

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:31.240
with that most of them and do a pretty
good job and the kids are healthy it's

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:31.250
good job and the kids are healthy it's
 

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.940
good job and the kids are healthy it's
fine I said I kind of see all that as a

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:33.950
fine I said I kind of see all that as a
 

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:37.630
fine I said I kind of see all that as a
non-issue and I'm surprised at the

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:37.640
non-issue and I'm surprised at the
 

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:41.740
non-issue and I'm surprised at the
passion about it on both sides I still

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:41.750
passion about it on both sides I still
 

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:44.290
passion about it on both sides I still
hear from people about how dangerous

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:44.300
hear from people about how dangerous
 

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:46.420
hear from people about how dangerous
vegetarian diets are which seems kind of

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:46.430
vegetarian diets are which seems kind of
 

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:49.410
vegetarian diets are which seems kind of
silly and on the other hand I hear from

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:49.420
silly and on the other hand I hear from
 

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:52.540
silly and on the other hand I hear from
vegetarians and vegans about how

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:52.550
vegetarians and vegans about how
 

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:55.900
vegetarians and vegans about how
terrible it is to eat meat and I don't

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:55.910
terrible it is to eat meat and I don't
 

00:12:55.910 --> 00:13:01.019
terrible it is to eat meat and I don't
buy either one of those

00:13:01.019 --> 00:13:01.029
 

00:13:01.029 --> 00:13:03.720
yeah the issue of meat-eating and the

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:03.730
yeah the issue of meat-eating and the
 

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:05.720
yeah the issue of meat-eating and the
environment is a very important one

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:05.730
environment is a very important one
 

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:08.999
environment is a very important one
particularly industrially industrially

00:13:08.999 --> 00:13:09.009
particularly industrially industrially
 

00:13:09.009 --> 00:13:11.910
particularly industrially industrially
raised meat in confined animal feeding

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:11.920
raised meat in confined animal feeding
 

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.009
raised meat in confined animal feeding
operations where you have large number

00:13:14.009 --> 00:13:14.019
operations where you have large number
 

00:13:14.019 --> 00:13:16.850
operations where you have large number
of animals in a very small area and

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:16.860
of animals in a very small area and
 

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.290
of animals in a very small area and
there's the whole question of first of

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:19.300
there's the whole question of first of
 

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.199
there's the whole question of first of
all what happens to their waste because

00:13:22.199 --> 00:13:22.209
all what happens to their waste because
 

00:13:22.209 --> 00:13:25.470
all what happens to their waste because
a pig farm can easily produce the amount

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:25.480
a pig farm can easily produce the amount
 

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.710
a pig farm can easily produce the amount
of waste that a city of 20,000 people

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:28.720
of waste that a city of 20,000 people
 

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.889
of waste that a city of 20,000 people
would produce in a day and yet it's not

00:13:31.889 --> 00:13:31.899
would produce in a day and yet it's not
 

00:13:31.899 --> 00:13:36.030
would produce in a day and yet it's not
treated no human population of 20,000

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:36.040
treated no human population of 20,000
 

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.650
treated no human population of 20,000
would be allowed to produce waste that

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:37.660
would be allowed to produce waste that
 

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.860
would be allowed to produce waste that
wasn't treated to destroy pathogenic

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:39.870
wasn't treated to destroy pathogenic
 

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:44.360
wasn't treated to destroy pathogenic
bacteria and yet we have laws that allow

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:44.370
bacteria and yet we have laws that allow
 

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:47.009
bacteria and yet we have laws that allow
these places to pollute the environment

00:13:47.009 --> 00:13:47.019
these places to pollute the environment
 

00:13:47.019 --> 00:13:49.530
these places to pollute the environment
with animal waste I think that's huge

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:49.540
with animal waste I think that's huge
 

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:51.689
with animal waste I think that's huge
problem and you go to a place that's

00:13:51.689 --> 00:13:51.699
problem and you go to a place that's
 

00:13:51.699 --> 00:13:53.550
problem and you go to a place that's
near a pig farm and you know about that

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:53.560
near a pig farm and you know about that
 

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:56.850
near a pig farm and you know about that
pig farm miles away you can smell it

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:56.860
pig farm miles away you can smell it
 

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:58.139
pig farm miles away you can smell it
that's something that we need to do

00:13:58.139 --> 00:13:58.149
that's something that we need to do
 

00:13:58.149 --> 00:13:59.910
that's something that we need to do
something about and I don't think that

00:13:59.910 --> 00:13:59.920
something about and I don't think that
 

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:03.629
something about and I don't think that
CAFO should be allowed to leave their

00:14:03.629 --> 00:14:03.639
CAFO should be allowed to leave their
 

00:14:03.639 --> 00:14:06.990
CAFO should be allowed to leave their
waste untreated there there are other

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:07.000
waste untreated there there are other
 

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.699
waste untreated there there are other
issues that have to do with greenhouse

00:14:08.699 --> 00:14:08.709
issues that have to do with greenhouse
 

00:14:08.709 --> 00:14:12.540
issues that have to do with greenhouse
gases and the fact that so much of our

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:12.550
gases and the fact that so much of our
 

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:16.559
gases and the fact that so much of our
grain corn soybeans and corn and

00:14:16.559 --> 00:14:16.569
grain corn soybeans and corn and
 

00:14:16.569 --> 00:14:19.379
grain corn soybeans and corn and
soybeans particularly is grown expressly

00:14:19.379 --> 00:14:19.389
soybeans particularly is grown expressly
 

00:14:19.389 --> 00:14:22.559
soybeans particularly is grown expressly
to feed animals if we didn't have if we

00:14:22.559 --> 00:14:22.569
to feed animals if we didn't have if we
 

00:14:22.569 --> 00:14:24.900
to feed animals if we didn't have if we
didn't need so much meat then we

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:24.910
didn't need so much meat then we
 

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:26.910
didn't need so much meat then we
wouldn't need to grow all that food to

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:26.920
wouldn't need to grow all that food to
 

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.639
wouldn't need to grow all that food to
feed animals and that would also have

00:14:29.639 --> 00:14:29.649
feed animals and that would also have
 

00:14:29.649 --> 00:14:32.879
feed animals and that would also have
great benefits for the environment so I

00:14:32.879 --> 00:14:32.889
great benefits for the environment so I
 

00:14:32.889 --> 00:14:35.069
great benefits for the environment so I
guess where I stand on this is if you do

00:14:35.069 --> 00:14:35.079
guess where I stand on this is if you do
 

00:14:35.079 --> 00:14:37.410
guess where I stand on this is if you do
eat meat then just don't eat so much of

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:37.420
eat meat then just don't eat so much of
 

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:39.600
eat meat then just don't eat so much of
it
