00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.240
Now that you have a different
set of pitches ready,

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.210
you need to get out there and
practice them.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.580
When you talk to a few people, make
sure that you ask for some feedback.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.460
Ask them what they took
away from your pitch.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.800
If you say lead,
do they hear spearheading?

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.450
If you say full service,
do they hear holistic?

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.890
Is this what you were even
hoping to get out of it?

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.310
If not,
then you need to revise your story and

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.560
make sure that they
receive the right message.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.650
Taking this feedback seriously
is the best chance you have

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.360
to continue building a better story for
your business.
