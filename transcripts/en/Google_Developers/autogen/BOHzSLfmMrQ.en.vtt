straightforward demo application and
let's take a quick look to see see what

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660
let's take a quick look to see see what
 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.660
let's take a quick look to see see what
that looks like we seem to have a map of

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670
that looks like we seem to have a map of
 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.459
that looks like we seem to have a map of

beautiful card showing some details

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049
beautiful card showing some details
 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.930
beautiful card showing some details
about in this particular case the

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940
about in this particular case the
 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.850
about in this particular case the
neighborhood and if you look at the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860
neighborhood and if you look at the
 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.620
neighborhood and if you look at the
icons there are different categories we

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630
icons there are different categories we
 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.660
icons there are different categories we
have this little categories drop down at

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670
have this little categories drop down at
 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.090
have this little categories drop down at
the top left and free base is full of

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100
the top left and free base is full of
 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.710
the top left and free base is full of
tons of different categories and

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720
tons of different categories and
 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.420
tons of different categories and
subcategories and all these linked

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430
subcategories and all these linked
 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.160
subcategories and all these linked
categories but we've just taken kind of

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170
categories but we've just taken kind of
 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.109
categories but we've just taken kind of
a random sampling of some of them so

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119
a random sampling of some of them so
 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.450
a random sampling of some of them so
when you take a look at the code you can

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460
when you take a look at the code you can
 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.190
when you take a look at the code you can
see how to make these types of queries

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200
see how to make these types of queries
 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.260
see how to make these types of queries
so go ahead and click maybe a couple of

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270
so go ahead and click maybe a couple of
 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.500
so go ahead and click maybe a couple of
more and here we go and you get the

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510
more and here we go and you get the
 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.469
more and here we go and you get the
general idea so we have here at Google

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479
general idea so we have here at Google
 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.469
general idea so we have here at Google
Maps API some queries to the freebase

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479
Maps API some queries to the freebase
 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.690
Maps API some queries to the freebase
API and then in addition there's really

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700
API and then in addition there's really
 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.340
API and then in addition there's really
beautiful little cards library which

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350
beautiful little cards library which
 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.380
beautiful little cards library which
displays them in a nice manner and all

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390
displays them in a nice manner and all
 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.690
displays them in a nice manner and all
of that if you look at the URL is up on

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700
of that if you look at the URL is up on
 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.130
of that if you look at the URL is up on
github we'll talk a little bit more

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140
github we'll talk a little bit more
 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.140
github we'll talk a little bit more
about that in a second that is a very

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150
about that in a second that is a very
 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.569
about that in a second that is a very
cool demo so it sounds like we are

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579
cool demo so it sounds like we are
 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.850
cool demo so it sounds like we are
querying freebase maybe we could go a

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860
querying freebase maybe we could go a
 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.469
querying freebase maybe we could go a
little bit more detail into how we

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479
little bit more detail into how we
 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.670
little bit more detail into how we
actually do that to get the location

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680
actually do that to get the location
 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.149
actually do that to get the location
data back out yeah exactly um actually

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:11.159
data back out yeah exactly um actually
 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:13.160
data back out yeah exactly um actually
we're using two different api's from

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170
we're using two different api's from
 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.620
we're using two different api's from
freebase in this application the first

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630
freebase in this application the first
 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.510
freebase in this application the first
API is the Search API

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520
API is the Search API
 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.000
API is the Search API
allows us to take some geographical

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010
allows us to take some geographical
 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.130
allows us to take some geographical
boundaries and ask freebase what are

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140
boundaries and ask freebase what are
 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.010
boundaries and ask freebase what are
interesting objects located in that area

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020
interesting objects located in that area
 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.100
interesting objects located in that area
and then we're using a topic API that

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110
and then we're using a topic API that
 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.110
and then we're using a topic API that
allows us to query for some details

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120
allows us to query for some details
 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.090
allows us to query for some details
about particular object so that we can

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100
about particular object so that we can
 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.700
about particular object so that we can
bring up the decart I can show you how

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710
bring up the decart I can show you how
 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.070
bring up the decart I can show you how
it works with the code into tabs of the

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080
it works with the code into tabs of the
 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.200
it works with the code into tabs of the
Chrome browser now awesome so we're

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210
Chrome browser now awesome so we're
 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.030

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890
are many more parents that are available
 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.199
are many more parents that are available
such as check out documentation and

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209
such as check out documentation and
 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.230
such as check out documentation and
formatter queries accordingly the second

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240
formatter queries accordingly the second
 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.680
formatter queries accordingly the second
part on the output and tells freebase to

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690
part on the output and tells freebase to
 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.860
part on the output and tells freebase to
return apart from all like generic data

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870
return apart from all like generic data
 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.720
return apart from all like generic data
about the objects also the geolocation

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730
about the objects also the geolocation
 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.470
about the objects also the geolocation
data this allows the Maps API later on

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480
data this allows the Maps API later on
 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.510
data this allows the Maps API later on
to take over that data and plot it on

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520
to take over that data and plot it on
 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.180
to take over that data and plot it on
the map right so without that last part

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190
the map right so without that last part
 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.920
the map right so without that last part
would get the results back but we

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930
would get the results back but we
 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.090
would get the results back but we
wouldn't know the latitude longitude

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100
wouldn't know the latitude longitude
 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.280
wouldn't know the latitude longitude
where to place them on the map exactly

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290
where to place them on the map exactly
 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.020
where to place them on the map exactly
that's the point of returning the

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030
that's the point of returning the
 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.470
that's the point of returning the
geolocation data okay and after the

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480
geolocation data okay and after the
 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.090
geolocation data okay and after the
Search API let's just take a quick look

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100
Search API let's just take a quick look
 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.110
Search API let's just take a quick look
at the details API this is the topics

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120
at the details API this is the topics
 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.439
at the details API this is the topics

I we issued this query any time the user

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090
I we issued this query any time the user
 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.360
I we issued this query any time the user
clicks on a given icon because we want

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370
clicks on a given icon because we want
 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.309
clicks on a given icon because we want
to get more data about the particular

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:35.319
to get more data about the particular
 

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:38.219
to get more data about the particular
object the URL is a free based version

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229
object the URL is a free based version
 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:40.260
object the URL is a free based version
one topic because we're acquiring about

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270
one topic because we're acquiring about
 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.899
one topic because we're acquiring about
topics topics are nodes or entities in

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:42.909
topics topics are nodes or entities in
 

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:45.659
topics topics are nodes or entities in
in freebase and then each topic is

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669
in freebase and then each topic is
 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.760
in freebase and then each topic is
identified by a unique identifier

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770
identified by a unique identifier
 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.640
identified by a unique identifier
usually they look something like m / and

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650
usually they look something like m / and
 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.769
usually they look something like m / and
numerical value so here you can see that

00:04:52.769 --> 00:04:52.779
numerical value so here you can see that
 

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:56.129
numerical value so here you can see that
issue just a get query for topic / m /

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139
issue just a get query for topic / m /
 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.719
issue just a get query for topic / m /
ID and that brings me back and a very

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729
ID and that brings me back and a very
 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:02.999
ID and that brings me back and a very
rich response with all possible data

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:03.009
rich response with all possible data
 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:05.959
rich response with all possible data
that freebase knows about the particular

00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:05.969
that freebase knows about the particular
 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:09.239
that freebase knows about the particular
object right now in the example card to

00:05:09.239 --> 00:05:09.249
object right now in the example card to
 

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:11.519
object right now in the example card to
render only some of this data but the

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:11.529
render only some of this data but the
 

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:14.189
render only some of this data but the
possibilities are really endless yeah so

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:14.199
possibilities are really endless yeah so
 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:16.200
possibilities are really endless yeah so
for example correct me if I'm wrong we

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210
for example correct me if I'm wrong we
 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.059
for example correct me if I'm wrong we
might have say the architect of this

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:18.069
might have say the architect of this
 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:19.980
might have say the architect of this
particular high school and then because

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990
particular high school and then because
 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.779
particular high school and then because
it's a kind of a linked graph we could

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:21.789
it's a kind of a linked graph we could
 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:23.790
it's a kind of a linked graph we could
click more information for the architect

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800
click more information for the architect
 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.040
click more information for the architect
and get all of the other buildings he

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050
and get all of the other buildings he
 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.719
and get all of the other buildings he
may have had a hand in to get those

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:27.729
may have had a hand in to get those
 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:29.489
may have had a hand in to get those
results back and potentially put them on

00:05:29.489 --> 00:05:29.499
results back and potentially put them on
 

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:32.459
results back and potentially put them on
a map exactly because it's a graph you

00:05:32.459 --> 00:05:32.469
a map exactly because it's a graph you
 

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:34.679
a map exactly because it's a graph you
can add a lot of exploratory features

00:05:34.679 --> 00:05:34.689
can add a lot of exploratory features
 

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:36.929
can add a lot of exploratory features
for your users yeah so we're really

00:05:36.929 --> 00:05:36.939
for your users yeah so we're really
 

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:38.850
for your users yeah so we're really
excited about this and having developers

freebase craft along and maybe putting
 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.769
freebase craft along and maybe putting
them on a map if you feel so inclined

00:05:46.769 --> 00:05:46.779
them on a map if you feel so inclined
 

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:48.749
them on a map if you feel so inclined
there's tons of stuff and it's a it's a
