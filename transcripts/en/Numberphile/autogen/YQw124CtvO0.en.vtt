from this number we created as part of

from this number we created as part of
 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.889
from this number we created as part of
an experiment the challenge to find out

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899
an experiment the challenge to find out
 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.480
an experiment the challenge to find out
more about the security of the

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140
cryptographic scheme that we proposed
 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.469
cryptographic scheme that we proposed
the scheme that we proposed was based on

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479
the scheme that we proposed was based on
 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.080
the scheme that we proposed was based on
products of large prime numbers so this

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090
products of large prime numbers so this
 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.149
products of large prime numbers so this
number has an interesting property it's

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159
number has an interesting property it's
 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.830
number has an interesting property it's
the product of a large prime number P

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840
the product of a large prime number P
 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.649
the product of a large prime number P
and another large fun member q and you

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659
and another large fun member q and you
 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.060
and another large fun member q and you
multiply those two prime numbers

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070
multiply those two prime numbers
 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.240
multiply those two prime numbers
together and you get this number RSA 129

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250
together and you get this number RSA 129
 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.429
together and you get this number RSA 129
so that's why was created and we created

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439
so that's why was created and we created
 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.920
so that's why was created and we created

so why did you keep them in safe with
 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.320
so why did you keep them in safe with
something so I can use the answer to the

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349
puzzle well if the puzzle gets solved
 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.229
puzzle well if the puzzle gets solved
then we will find out the P and the Q

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239
then we will find out the P and the Q
 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.699
then we will find out the P and the Q
and if the puzzle didn't get solved all

numbers finding a prime numbers it's not
that hard actually I mean you just need

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239
that hard actually I mean you just need
 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:18.789
that hard actually I mean you just need
to find big numbers and finding big

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799
to find big numbers and finding big
 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.920
to find big numbers and finding big
numbers that hurt big random numbers I'm

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930
numbers that hurt big random numbers I'm
 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.020
numbers that hurt big random numbers I'm
so hard you can roll some dice order you

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030
so hard you can roll some dice order you
 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.030
so hard you can roll some dice order you
know use other methods and so we gave

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040
know use other methods and so we gave
 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.890
know use other methods and so we gave
some some big rant big random numbers

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900
some some big rant big random numbers
 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.539
some some big rant big random numbers
and then you can see is that number

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549
and then you can see is that number
 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.030
and then you can see is that number
prime well maybe not maybe it's even so

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040
prime well maybe not maybe it's even so
 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.430
prime well maybe not maybe it's even so
it's obviously not prime so if you can

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440
it's obviously not prime so if you can
 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.960
it's obviously not prime so if you can
add 1 to it and take that numbers Prime

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970
add 1 to it and take that numbers Prime
 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.340
add 1 to it and take that numbers Prime
and there's an easy test for primarily

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350
and there's an easy test for primarily
 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.080
and there's an easy test for primarily
which I don't need to go into here but

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090
which I don't need to go into here but
 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.970
which I don't need to go into here but
it's easy to test up a numbers Prime and

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980
it's easy to test up a numbers Prime and
 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.370
it's easy to test up a numbers Prime and
so you can just search a little bit and

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380
so you can just search a little bit and
 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.710
so you can just search a little bit and
Prime's are actually quite common so it

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720
Prime's are actually quite common so it
 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.240
Prime's are actually quite common so it
doesn't take much time to find out large

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250
doesn't take much time to find out large
 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.500
doesn't take much time to find out large
prime number and then you got your

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510
prime number and then you got your
 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.449
prime number and then you got your
number P and you can do the same thing

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459
number P and you can do the same thing
 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:50.710

to find your number Q and you got a big

to find your number Q and you got a big
 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.509
to find your number Q and you got a big
prime number P a big 9 primary cube RSA

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519

somebody how to encrypt without telling
 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.979
somebody how to encrypt without telling
them how to decrypt so the idea of RSA

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989

is that the core difficulty that you

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:10.639
is that the core difficulty that you
 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:12.250

give an adversary is the product of

give an adversary is the product of
 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.289
give an adversary is the product of
factoring a large number and so you

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299
factoring a large number and so you
 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:15.970
factoring a large number and so you
might choose to large prime numbers

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120
case that the RSA is flexible in the
 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.580
case that the RSA is flexible in the
sense that you can choose prime numbers

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590
sense that you can choose prime numbers
 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.370
sense that you can choose prime numbers
of any length and build an RSA modulus

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380
of any length and build an RSA modulus
 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.230
of any length and build an RSA modulus
that way so you can build numbers of

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240
that way so you can build numbers of
 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.020
that way so you can build numbers of
