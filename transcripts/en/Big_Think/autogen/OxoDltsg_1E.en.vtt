the moment in which our entanglement

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979
the moment in which our entanglement
 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.100

that problem and that's really the seeds
 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.999
that problem and that's really the seeds
of what has borne out over the years i

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009

of campaigns because we're again it's

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579
of campaigns because we're again it's
 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.789
of campaigns because we're again it's
it's it's the intersection of politics

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799
it's it's the intersection of politics
 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.440

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880
they're about drawing distinctions you
 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.310
they're about drawing distinctions you
know one side tries to distinguish

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320
know one side tries to distinguish
 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.440
know one side tries to distinguish
himself from the other so I think

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450
himself from the other so I think
 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.479
himself from the other so I think
