&gt;&gt;Well, I like this question, the general
question.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.610
What do you think will be the most exciting
innovation, development

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:11.329
over the next decade that will help improve
the state of the world?

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:15.150
I think it will be a realization that art
and design and creativity are

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.490
actually very vital to innovation.
And that shift from technology to art and

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.330
design will occur sometime in
the next five years.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.380
So I'm excited about that.
I'm done.
