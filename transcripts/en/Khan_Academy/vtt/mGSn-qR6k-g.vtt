00:00:00.041 --> 00:00:01.862
- [Voiceover] So, let's
get even more practice

00:00:01.862 --> 00:00:03.603
solving some exponential equations,

00:00:03.603 --> 00:00:05.867
and I have two different
exponential equations here.

00:00:05.867 --> 00:00:07.550
And like always, pause the video

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.288
and see if you can solve
for x in both of them.

00:00:11.288 --> 00:00:13.889
All right, let's tackle
this one in purple first.

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.239
And you might first notice that

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:19.264
on both sides of the equation
I have different bases.

00:00:19.264 --> 00:00:21.562
So, it would be nice
to have a common base.

00:00:21.562 --> 00:00:22.967
And when you look at it, you're like,

00:00:22.967 --> 00:00:25.161
"Well, 32 is not a power of eight,

00:00:25.161 --> 00:00:27.483
"or at least it's not an
integer power of eight."

00:00:27.483 --> 00:00:30.652
But, they are both powers of two.

00:00:30.652 --> 00:00:35.017
32 is the same thing as
two to the fifth power,

00:00:35.017 --> 00:00:36.236
two to the fifth power,

00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:40.653
and eight is the same thing
as two to the third power,

00:00:40.653 --> 00:00:41.669
two to the third power.

00:00:41.669 --> 00:00:44.119
So, I can rewrite our original equation,

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:46.255
as, instead of writing
32, I could write it

00:00:46.255 --> 00:00:48.911
as two to the fifth,

00:00:49.331 --> 00:00:50.620
and then that's going to be raised

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.075
to the x over three power,

00:00:53.615 --> 00:00:55.112
X over three power,

00:00:55.112 --> 00:00:57.758
is equal to, instead of writing eight,

00:00:57.758 --> 00:01:00.347
I could write two to the third power,

00:01:00.347 --> 00:01:02.055
two to the third power,

00:01:02.055 --> 00:01:05.219
and I'm raising that to the x minus 12,

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:07.267
x minus 12.

00:01:07.267 --> 00:01:08.718
Now if I raise something to a power,

00:01:08.718 --> 00:01:09.972
and then raise that to a power,

00:01:09.972 --> 00:01:12.154
I could just multiply these exponents.

00:01:12.154 --> 00:01:16.257
So, I can rewrite the
left-hand side as two

00:01:16.257 --> 00:01:20.675
to the five-x over three,

00:01:20.675 --> 00:01:23.612
five-x over three power.

00:01:23.612 --> 00:01:25.365
I just multiply these exponents.

00:01:25.365 --> 00:01:27.827
And that's going to be equal to

00:01:27.827 --> 00:01:29.916
two to the...

00:01:29.916 --> 00:01:34.856
And now I just multiply
the three times x minus 12.

00:01:34.856 --> 00:01:39.062
So, two to the three-x minus 36,

00:01:39.062 --> 00:01:40.746
and now things have simplified nicely.

00:01:40.746 --> 00:01:42.959
I have two to this power is equal to

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:44.491
two to that power.

00:01:44.491 --> 00:01:47.343
So, these two exponents
must be equal to each other.

00:01:47.343 --> 00:01:50.827
Five-x over three must be equal to

00:01:50.827 --> 00:01:53.406
three-x minus 36.

00:01:53.406 --> 00:01:56.293
So, let's set them equal to
each other and solve for x.

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.555
So five-x over three is equal to

00:02:00.555 --> 00:02:03.780
three-x minus 36.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.680
Let's see, we could,

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.989
we could multiply, we could multiply

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.439
everything by three.

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:12.904
Let's do that.

00:02:12.904 --> 00:02:15.911
So if we multiply everything times three,

00:02:15.911 --> 00:02:19.371
here we're going to get five-x

00:02:19.371 --> 00:02:24.331
is equal to nine-x minus...

00:02:24.331 --> 00:02:24.908
What is this?

00:02:24.908 --> 00:02:27.648
Nine-x minus 108.

00:02:27.648 --> 00:02:31.049
And now we can subtract nine-x

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:32.442
from both sides,

00:02:32.442 --> 00:02:34.787
and so we will get five-x minus nine-x

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:37.938
is gonna be negative four-x is equal to

00:02:37.938 --> 00:02:40.260
negative 108.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.514
We're in the homestretch here.

00:02:41.514 --> 00:02:43.928
Divide, whoops, sorry about that.

00:02:43.928 --> 00:02:47.250
We could divide both
sides by negative four.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.210
Negative four.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.776
And we are left with x is equal to,

00:02:51.776 --> 00:02:53.773
what is this going to be, 27.

00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:56.095
X is equal to 27.

00:02:56.095 --> 00:02:58.869
And we are all done.

00:02:58.869 --> 00:02:59.811
We're all done.

00:02:59.811 --> 00:03:01.829
And if you had substituted
x back in there,

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.786
you would get 32 to the 27 divided by 3,

00:03:04.786 --> 00:03:07.807
so 32 to the ninth
power, is the same thing

00:03:07.807 --> 00:03:11.674
as eight to the 27 minus 12th power.

00:03:11.674 --> 00:03:13.943
So eight to the 15th.

00:03:13.943 --> 00:03:16.871
Yeah, 27 minus 12,
eight to the 15th power.

00:03:16.871 --> 00:03:19.147
So, anyway, that was fun.

00:03:19.147 --> 00:03:21.473
Let's do the next one now.

00:03:21.473 --> 00:03:24.382
So this one looks
interesting in other ways.

00:03:24.382 --> 00:03:26.215
We have rational expressions.

00:03:26.215 --> 00:03:28.881
We have an exponential up
here, exponential down here.

00:03:28.881 --> 00:03:31.051
And the key realization here is...

00:03:31.051 --> 00:03:32.822
Well, the first thing I'd like to do.

00:03:32.822 --> 00:03:36.444
Let me write this 25 in terms of five.

00:03:36.444 --> 00:03:39.567
We know that 25 is the
same thing as five-squared.

00:03:39.567 --> 00:03:42.062
So, we can rewrite this as

00:03:42.872 --> 00:03:46.658
five to the four-x plus three

00:03:46.658 --> 00:03:49.864
over, instead of 25, I could rewrite that

00:03:49.864 --> 00:03:53.010
as five-squared, and then I'm gonna raise

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.425
that to the nine minus x,

00:03:55.425 --> 00:03:58.222
to the nine minus x,

00:03:58.222 --> 00:03:59.546
and that, of course,
is going to be equal to

00:03:59.546 --> 00:04:03.087
five to the two-x plus five.

00:04:03.087 --> 00:04:04.944
Now five to the second, and then that

00:04:04.944 --> 00:04:06.662
to the nine minus x.

00:04:06.662 --> 00:04:08.880
I can just multiply these exponents.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.832
So, this is going to be five
to the four-x plus three

00:04:13.832 --> 00:04:18.068
over five to the...

00:04:18.068 --> 00:04:20.047
Two times nine is 18,

00:04:20.047 --> 00:04:23.704
two times negative-x is negative two-x,

00:04:23.704 --> 00:04:26.467
and that is going to be equal to,

00:04:26.467 --> 00:04:30.728
that is going to be equal to five

00:04:30.728 --> 00:04:34.048
to the two-x plus five.

00:04:34.048 --> 00:04:35.278
And now, let's see.

00:04:35.278 --> 00:04:37.147
There's multiple ways
that we could tackle it.

00:04:37.147 --> 00:04:39.254
We could multiply both
sides of this equation

00:04:39.254 --> 00:04:43.786
by five to the 18

00:04:43.786 --> 00:04:44.856
minus two-x.

00:04:44.856 --> 00:04:46.173
That's one way to do it.

00:04:46.173 --> 00:04:47.775
Or we could say, "Hey, look I have five

00:04:47.775 --> 00:04:49.353
"to some exponent divided by five

00:04:49.353 --> 00:04:51.687
"to some other exponent,
so I could just subtract

00:04:51.687 --> 00:04:54.589
"this blue exponent from this yellow one."

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:57.223
So, the left-hand side will simplify to

00:04:57.793 --> 00:05:01.996
five to the four-x plus three

00:05:01.996 --> 00:05:06.430
minus, let me just do
minus in a neutral color,

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.155
minus 18 minus two-x.

00:05:11.155 --> 00:05:13.210
18 minus two-x.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.648
and that, of course,
is going to be equal to

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:17.505
what we've had on the right-hand side,

00:05:17.505 --> 00:05:20.849
five to the two-x plus five.

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:23.554
Now we just have to simplify a little bit.

00:05:23.554 --> 00:05:25.574
Let's see, this is going to be...

00:05:25.574 --> 00:05:27.106
In fact, we could just say, "Look..."

00:05:27.106 --> 00:05:29.428
Now I'm having trouble
with my little pen tool.

00:05:29.428 --> 00:05:30.902
Whoops.

00:05:30.902 --> 00:05:31.773
All right.

00:05:31.773 --> 00:05:33.247
So now we could say this exponent needs

00:05:33.247 --> 00:05:34.269
to be equal to that exponent

00:05:34.269 --> 00:05:35.906
because we have the same base.

00:05:35.906 --> 00:05:40.182
And so, what we have here
on the left-hand side,

00:05:40.932 --> 00:05:44.891
that I could rewrite as four-x plus three

00:05:44.891 --> 00:05:48.792
minus 18 plus two-x.

00:05:48.792 --> 00:05:50.185
I'm just multiplying the negative times

00:05:50.185 --> 00:05:51.311
both of these terms.

00:05:51.311 --> 00:05:54.701
So, plus two-x, is going to be equal to

00:05:54.701 --> 00:05:56.929
two-x plus five.

00:05:56.929 --> 00:05:59.720
Two-x plus five.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.730
So, there's a bunch of different
things we could do here.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.766
One, we could subtract
two-x from both sides,

00:06:04.766 --> 00:06:06.205
that'll clean it up a little bit.

00:06:06.205 --> 00:06:07.749
Two-x from both sides.

00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:11.583
We could also subtract
five from both sides.

00:06:11.583 --> 00:06:13.345
So, let's just do that.

00:06:13.345 --> 00:06:17.083
So, well, let me just subtract it.

00:06:17.083 --> 00:06:19.265
Subtract five from both sides.

00:06:19.265 --> 00:06:20.821
I'm skipping some steps here,

00:06:20.821 --> 00:06:23.119
but I figure you're at this point

00:06:23.119 --> 00:06:25.956
reasonably comfortable
with linear equations.

00:06:25.956 --> 00:06:29.168
So then, on the left-hand side,

00:06:29.168 --> 00:06:31.722
we are going to have four-x,

00:06:31.722 --> 00:06:35.019
and then you have three
minus 18 minus five.

00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:39.296
Three minus 18 is negative 15,

00:06:39.296 --> 00:06:42.437
minus five, is negative 20,

00:06:42.437 --> 00:06:46.303
Is going to be equal to zero.

00:06:46.303 --> 00:06:48.462
And then, because those cancel out.

00:06:48.462 --> 00:06:49.843
And so add 20 to both sides,

00:06:49.843 --> 00:06:53.036
you get four-x is equal to 20.

00:06:53.036 --> 00:06:55.659
Divide both sides by four,

00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:58.724
and we get x is equal to five.

00:06:58.724 --> 00:07:00.846
And we are all done.
