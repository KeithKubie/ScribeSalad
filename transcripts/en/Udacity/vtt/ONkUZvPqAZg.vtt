00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.105
So here's my question again and this is the model that we agreed upon. let's pair

00:00:05.117 --> 00:00:10.091
some math with this model.I would have one stamp plus 2 piles of 3 or 2 times of

00:00:10.103 --> 00:00:15.243
3. Okay, here's what exiting about this math. I can actually calculate this math

00:00:15.255 --> 00:00:19.875
two ways, I could do 1 plus 2 and get 3 times 3 which is 9 or I can do 2 times 3

00:00:19.992 --> 00:00:24.109
which is 6 and then add 1 which is 7. I know that the second answer must be

00:00:24.121 --> 00:00:27.747
correct. I have 7 stamps in my diagram so I know that I need to do

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.343
multiplication first. This 2 has a choice. It can either go with multiplication

00:00:32.354 --> 00:00:36.813
or it could go with addition. I know multiplication takes priority. That's so

00:00:36.825 --> 00:00:41.459
that way I can get the correct answer of 7. Just like in my model. Okay, so when

00:00:41.471 --> 00:00:45.627
I think about the order of operations, I know multiplication occurs before

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:49.734
addition. Multiplication has to happen before addition. It's at a higher

00:00:49.746 --> 00:00:53.572
priority level. It turns out that multiplication is also done before

00:00:53.584 --> 00:00:57.557
subtraction. We know this because subtraction is the same as adding the

00:00:57.569 --> 00:01:01.911
opposite. For example, 3 minus 1 times 2. Subtracting a positive 1 is the same

00:01:01.923 --> 00:01:06.130
thing as adding a negative 1 or adding the opposite. So I can have 3 plus

00:01:06.142 --> 00:01:10.622
negative 1 times 2. Here the negative 1 can go with either the multiplication or

00:01:10.634 --> 00:01:15.238
the addition. I know that multiplication comes first, it has higher priority. So

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.495
I should do 3 plus negative 2 and I get 1. So when thinking about the order of

00:01:19.507 --> 00:01:24.024
operations, we know addition and subtraction should be on the bottom, they come

00:01:24.036 --> 00:01:28.166
last. Multiplication should come before addition and subtraction I'm going to

00:01:28.406 --> 00:01:31.503
keep track of our order of operations right here, and we'll come back to this

00:01:31.515 --> 00:01:34.236
later. Alright, let's check your understanding of this with a quiz.
