[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.390
So here we are on the last day
of the recording for the

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.870
Christmas Lectures, but
I thought I'd take an

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.700
opportunity to point this out
because it's so beautiful.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.190
This is a really stunning cloud
chamber, and the tracks

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.760
that you can see here show just
the natural radiation in

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.020
the atmosphere around us.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.870
So if we actually have a look in
here, you can see sometimes

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.390
there are thicker tracks which
are big heavy alpha particles.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.790
Sometimes they're little
wispy ones,

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.150
which are beta particles.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.740
But all of these, they're all
working in the same way.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.510
So the atmosphere in
here contains a

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.600
lot vapour of alcohol.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.420
And it's sort of more
than it should have.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.060
And when these charged particles
fire through the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.040
atmosphere in here, they cause
little droplets to form, and

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.390
those are the clouds
that you're seeing.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.560
So this is a similar sort of
thing to when you get a track

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.820
behind an airplane.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.200
There's a lot of moisture in the
atmosphere and it's just

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.550
the exhaust, just helping those
drops of moisture to

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.365
form together and leave
that cloud.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.980
And this is a tiny little
sample of the

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.250
element called Americium.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.420
And this is used in
smoke detectors.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.920
So you've probably got some of
this in your home, at least

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.610
you should have.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.820
So this is an artificially
produced metal.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.870
And as soon as this is
introduced, look at that.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.720
What we're seeing here are
tracks from the alpha

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.500
particles emitted from this
radioactive source.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.200
And these alpha particles, with
their two protons, two

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.900
neutrons, and they
grab electrons

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.060
and form Helium atoms.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.760
So what you're seeing here are
the birth of Helium atoms.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:42.623
