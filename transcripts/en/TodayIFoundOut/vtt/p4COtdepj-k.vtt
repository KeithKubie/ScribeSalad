00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:11.360
The Blind Man Who Invented Cruise Control

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.709
While speed governing systems have been around
on automobiles almost as long as they have

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:19.780
existed (the first known one was installed
on a Wilson-Pilcher car in 1900) and similar

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:25.700
systems have been around long before that
to control steam engines (as far back as the

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.420
17th century), the invention of the modern
cruise control system is credited to inventor

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.960
and Automotive Hall of Famer, Ralph Teetor-
a man who couldn’t actually drive due to

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.800
being completely blind.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.649
The inspiration for the cruise control system
struck Teetor while he was riding with his

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:42.649
lawyer in the 1940s.

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:48.679
He noticed the lawyer had a tendency to slow
down while talking and speed up while listening.

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:53.329
This annoyed Teetor, who decided to come up
with a device to control the speed of the

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:54.329
car automatically.

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.269
After several years of tinkering, in 1948
he filed his first patent for a device to

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:00.550
accomplish just this.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.550
(US 2519859)

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.140
It took him almost another decade, and a few
more patents filed improving his original

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.160
device, to finally come up with a version
that would be installed on a commercially

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.480
sold vehicle.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.750
The first cars to boast the new technology
were the 1958 models of the Chrysler Imperial,

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.650
New Yorker and Windsor.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.480
By 1960, cruise control was a standard feature
on all Cadillacs.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.500
The system worked by calculating ground speed
based on driveshaft rotations.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.520
It then used a solenoid, as needed, to vary
the position of the throttle cable.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.870
Cruise control went by several names in the
early days.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:40.590
It was initially called everything from “Speedostat,”
to “Touchomatic” and “Auto-Pilot.”

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.770
It was Chrysler who finally came up with the
“cruise control” name.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.460
(Personally, I’d have preferred “Speedostat”…)

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.730
Different versions of the cruise control system
were soon invented by various people, with

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:57.420
the systems receiving a big boost in popularity
thanks to the oil crisis of the 1970s and

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.340
the savings in fuel a cruise control system
can potentially have, depending on one’s

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.340
driving habits.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.380
Today, the cruise control systems are still
evolving, including beginning to incorporate

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.130
some more advanced self-driving features such
as automatic braking.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.890
As for Teetor, he was blinded in an accident
when he was five-years-old, though he never

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:16.960
let it slow him down.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.800
In fact, in the December 21, 1902 edition
of the New York Herald, Teetor, who at the

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.660
time was 12 years old, made it into a featured
article:

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.090
A constructor of miniature dynamos and other
machinery at 10 and thoroughly versed in all

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.640
that pertains to their operation, and at 12
the builder of an automobile that carries

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.660
him about the streets of his native town and
far out upon the country roads at a speed

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:46.870
of from 18 to 25 miles an hour, is the remarkable
record of Ralph Teetor of Hagerstown, Indiana.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.880
The specific automobile referenced here was
a one-cylinder car that, with the help of

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.510
a cousin, he built using an old engine someone
threw away.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.820
He then machined the necessary parts to re-build
the engine and soon had himself a working

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.459
vehicle, all at the age of 12.

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.930
This blind mechanical prodigy went on to graduate
near the top of his class in 1912 with a degree

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.930
in mechanical engineering from the University
of Pennsylvania.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.160
A few years later, he developed a technology
for dynamically balancing steam turbine rotors

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.300
which was used in torpedo boat destroyers
during World War I.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.180
For his day job, Teetor became a mechanical
engineer for his family’s company, Light

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.520
Inspection Car Company of Hagerstown, Indiana
in the 1930s.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.190
The company was later renamed the Perfect
Circle Corporation.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.280
Perfect Circle provided piston rings to companies
like General Motors, Studebaker, Packard and

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.280
Chrysler.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.100
Teetor soon advanced to Vice President of
Engineering for the company and was eventually

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.630
named President.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.630
In the interim, he also developed an early
gas powered lawn mower and a new kind of fishing

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.520
rod handle that “provide[d] a fishing pole
handle which comfortably fits the fisherman’s

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.520
hand in a natural and effortless position
and permits a convenient and easy manipulation

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.910
of the reel by the thumb of the hand while
it is firmly gripping the handle,” (US 1898323)

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.849
along with filing many other patents throughout
his life.

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:13.100
He was also elected the president of the Society
of Automotive Engineers (SAE) in 1936.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.930
In 1963, SAE went ahead and named an award
after him, the Ralph R. Teetor Educational

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.830
Award which “honors those young educators
who are successfully preparing engineers for

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.500
meeting the challenges that face society.”

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.890
In 1965, he also received two honorary degrees,
one from the Indiana Institute of Technology

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:37.560
(Doctor of Engineering), and one from Earlham
College (Doctor of Law), among many other

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.930
awards and honors.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:53.270
He died at the ripe old age of 91 on February
15, 1982.
