00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 align:start position:0%
that bothered him obviously because it's
 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.629 align:start position:0%
that bothered him obviously because it's
his<00:03:46.930><c> sister</c><00:03:47.230><c> but</c><00:03:47.680><c> she</c><00:03:47.859><c> didn't</c><00:03:48.099><c> know</c><00:03:48.250><c> that</c><00:03:48.459><c> and</c>

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 align:start position:0%
his sister but she didn't know that and
 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.309 align:start position:0%
his sister but she didn't know that and
so<00:03:48.790><c> it</c><00:03:48.940><c> created</c><00:03:49.269><c> a</c><00:03:49.389><c> bit</c><00:03:49.540><c> of</c><00:03:49.660><c> a</c><00:03:49.720><c> drama</c><00:03:49.989><c> that</c><00:03:50.260><c> you</c>
