We've learned a bit about affordances,
semantics and how assistive technologies

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:09.580
use the accessibility tree to create
an alternative user experience.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.470
We also took a look at how
we can write expressive HTML

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.730
which makes this process as
straightforward as possible.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.750
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.865
Writing semantic HTML gives it a lot
of accessibility out of the box.

00:00:21.865 --> 00:00:25.132
Information such as form fields,
links and

00:00:25.132 --> 00:00:28.850
a lot of complex behavior
is given to you for free.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.580
I'd like to talk about a different
aspect of accessibility though.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.159
And that is how does a screen
reader user actually finds and

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:41.341
then reads the information in the page.

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:41.985
&gt;&gt; Right yeah,

00:00:41.985 --> 00:00:46.030
we haven't talked about how you actually
get around a page using a screen reader.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.990
On something like the flight booking
site we looked at in the last lesson,

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.480
there's really not a lot
of content on the page.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.320
So it's not a big deal to just
read the whole thing from the top.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.680
But on something like
a newspaper front page or

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.370
an email application like Gmail, it's
not really going to be practical to read

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.010
through every single thing until
you find what you're looking for.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.260
because you'd never get anything done.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.260
&gt;&gt; So true.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.170
Actually, you'd be surprised how many
people, when they start learning about

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.380
screen readers, assume that it's so
difficult and tedious to use.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.560
And to compensate for their assumption,

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.940
they tend to do things like making every
element on the web page focusable.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.230
So that a screen reader user has
an easier time getting to them.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.610
I've been using screen reader
since my college years, and

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.200
today I'd like to show
you just how it works.
