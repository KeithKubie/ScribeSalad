00:00:16.211 --> 00:00:19.269
How do you get from point A to point B?

00:00:29.144 --> 00:00:33.507
Why not spice it up with homemade special effects?

00:00:33.507 --> 00:00:35.771
A film is simply a series of images

00:00:35.771 --> 00:00:38.993
played in sequence to create the illusion of motion.

00:00:38.993 --> 00:00:40.735
If you manipulate those images,

00:00:40.735 --> 00:00:43.615
crazy things can happen.

00:00:43.615 --> 00:00:48.317
We used a tablet and one of the many stop motion apps out there.

00:00:48.317 --> 00:00:51.960
How do you get from point A to point B?

00:00:54.405 --> 00:00:58.714
We started off by taking a bunch of pictures of Celeste in place.

00:00:58.714 --> 00:01:01.012
Then, just like stop motion animation,

00:01:01.012 --> 00:01:03.012
the character is moved just a bit

00:01:03.012 --> 00:01:05.055
before the next picture is taken,

00:01:05.055 --> 00:01:08.371
which, in this case, creates a sliding effect.

00:01:15.016 --> 00:01:17.507
Here we use the oldest trick in the book.

00:01:17.507 --> 00:01:18.983
By alternating between photos

00:01:18.983 --> 00:01:21.612
of Celeste on-screen and off-screen,

00:01:21.612 --> 00:01:25.914
we've made her childhood dream of teleportation a reality.

00:01:25.914 --> 00:01:28.745
With a little creativity, there are a million ways

00:01:28.745 --> 00:01:30.703
you can used homemade special effects

00:01:30.703 --> 00:01:32.018
to make something as simple as

00:01:32.018 --> 00:01:36.001
getting from point A to point B much more fun.

00:02:57.332 --> 00:02:58.859
If you're at a loss for ideas,

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.195
try finding inspiration in your surroundings,

00:03:01.195 --> 00:03:02.279
like the refrigerator

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:04.090
and your coat rack.

00:03:13.577 --> 00:03:15.045
You can even try incorporating

00:03:15.045 --> 00:03:17.472
everyday objects from around your house,

00:03:17.472 --> 00:03:18.680
like, say, umbrellas

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.378
or binder clips.

00:03:25.491 --> 00:03:26.611
Wherever there is an object,

00:03:26.611 --> 00:03:29.954
there is an opportunity to make it come to life.

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:34.407
When humans are used in stop motion animation,

00:03:34.407 --> 00:03:36.034
that's called pixilation,

00:03:36.034 --> 00:03:38.495
a term coined in the mid-twentieth century,

00:03:38.495 --> 00:03:42.331
well before the word pixel was a part of our vocabulary.

00:03:42.331 --> 00:03:43.716
But these sorts of special effects

00:03:43.716 --> 00:03:46.084
are as old as the art of film making,

00:03:46.084 --> 00:03:48.207
and thanks to today's technologies,

00:03:48.207 --> 00:03:52.185
can be reproduced in your very own kitchen.

00:03:57.802 --> 00:04:00.183
Moving an object from point A to point B

00:04:00.183 --> 00:04:02.770
is a fundamental principle of animation.

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.076
To learn more about the process

00:04:04.076 --> 00:04:05.564
