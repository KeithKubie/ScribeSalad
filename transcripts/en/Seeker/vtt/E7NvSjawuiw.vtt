00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.650
In elementary school,
most of us learn

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.390
the human body is
75% water and we

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.110
are supposed to drink
eight glasses of water

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.830
every single day.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.587
But that H2O knowledge,
that's evaporated.

00:00:16.431 --> 00:00:17.390
Hey, hydraters.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.830
Trace here for D News.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:19.955
Babies are wet.

00:00:19.955 --> 00:00:22.050
Yeah, they are soaked in water.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.060
A recent NPR blog post talked
about how hydrated babies are.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.470
They are 75% water
when they're new.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.280
Just for comparison,
potatoes are about 80% water

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.630
and bananas, they're 74% water.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.340
As we grow older, we dry out.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.870
Adult men are only 60% water
while women are 55% water.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.480
The reason being
men tend to have

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.040
higher amounts of muscle
and women more fat, which

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.270
means muscle stores
more water and fat cells

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.740
are bit drier on average.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.450
But the fluid is actually
stored all over our body.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.150
Some is extracellular, stored
in the liver, the kidneys,

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.700
stomach, bladder, spinal
fluids, and so on.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.660
But more than half is
actually inside of your cells.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.495
The bottom line is that
water is vital to our health.

00:01:01.495 --> 00:01:02.640
It helps lubricate joints.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.819
It gives our waste
something to dissolve into.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:07.180
It keeps our tissues
healthy and pliable.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.930
But we lose it.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.380
We lose it all day, every day,
sweating, pooping, peeing.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.350
Constantly, it's
evaporating from our pores.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.490
And if we don't replace
it, we become dehydrated,

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.170
and our body suffers
in a number of ways.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.020
Which brings us to
a very good question

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.220
that D News fan Vijanti Persad
asked on our Facebook page.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.890
What is the right
or required amount

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.580
of water intake for a person?

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.830
That is an excellent question.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:29.940
We've all heard
that you're supposed

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.360
to drink eight glasses
of water a day.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.568
But where did that come from?

00:01:32.568 --> 00:01:33.120
No one knows.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.578
The debunking
masters at snopes.com

00:01:34.578 --> 00:01:37.224
couldn't even find
original research on it.

00:01:37.224 --> 00:01:39.390
They talked to Barbara
Rolls, a nutrition researcher

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.066
at Penn State who's
written a book about water,

00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:43.940
and even she doesn't
know where it came from.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.150
The Mayo Clinic says the
science is contested,

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.740
but it sure is easy to
remember, so why not?

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.350
Honestly, a lot of our fluid
intake comes from food.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.700
The rules say that we
need to drink fluid,

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.560
so if we eat a
banana or an orange,

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.150
we consume their fluid, which
is to say, we take their water.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.980
Like fricking Dune, man, the
spice must flow and all that.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.970
An orange contains approximately
eight ounces of fluid.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.389
But if you drink a lot
of diuretics, like soda,

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.970
your kidneys start to shed
sodium, meaning you need more

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.820
to replace it, which is bad.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.590
So while, yes, by drinking
sodas you're drinking fluids,

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.640
you're doing it wrong.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.642
Exactly how much
water or fluid you're

00:02:20.642 --> 00:02:22.100
supposed to drink
every day depends

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.480
on things like body size and
how much exercise you get,

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.530
how hot and dry the climate
is and whether you're

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.740
sick or pregnant.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.440
The truth is it
probably wouldn't

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.097
hurt you to drink 8 to 12 8
ounce glasses of fluid per day,

00:02:33.097 --> 00:02:34.930
but a really good way
to test whether you're

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.650
drinking enough water is to
look at your pee-- seriously.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.080
When I was hiking in
the desert, the guides

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.670
told us that it should
be clear and copious.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.100
If it's yellow, that
means you're dehydrated.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.820
So drink up and keep a BPA
free water bottle around

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.920
to fill it up directly
from your tap.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.800
What do you do to stay hydrated?

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.800
Give us some strategies.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.720
Let us know in the
comments, and thanks a lot

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.806
for watching D News everybody.
