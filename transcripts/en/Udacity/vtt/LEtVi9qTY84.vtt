00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.470
When it comes to games that exercise the mind,
a lot of people think of chess as their go-to

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:18.470
answer.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.000
Others, however, especially those in east
Asia, might give a different answer: Go.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.160
Go has a number of similarities with chess
- both are abstract strategy games with long

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.520
histories, both are played by millions of
people around the world, and both games have

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.050
seen strong interest from the artificial intelligence
community in the development of computer agents

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.910
that can play at a master human level.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.080
In terms of AI, Go presents a much more difficult
game for computers' AIs to handle than chess.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.470
A chess-playing computer program beat the
top chess professional in 1997, when IBM's

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.210
Deep Blue took on Gary Kasperov.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.400
It took nearly a further two decades, an eternity
in technology terms, for a computer to defeat

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.170
a top human professional in Go, when Google
Deep Ming's Alpha Go took on Lee Sedol in

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.879
2016.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.430
In terms of rules, Go is a far simpler game
than chess.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.500
There's only one kind of piece, and only four
basic rules.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.110
So what is it about Go that makes it so difficult
for computers to play?

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.570
There are two major reasons.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.200
First, the search space for Go is much larger
than it is for chess.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.930
A large component of traditional strategies
for chess AIs includes digging down in game

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.990
trees and exploring as many combinatorial
possibilities for moves as possible.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.170
This is much less viable for Go.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.200
A single turn in Go consists of the placement
of a stone on one intersection in a 19-by-19

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.200
grid.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.080
In an average turn in Go, a player might have
over 200 unique possible moves.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.310
Compare this to chess, where you might have
an average of about 35-moves per player.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.420
In addition, a typical game of chess might
be about 40-moves per player; compare that

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.370
to Go, where a game can be over 100-moves
per player.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.480
Because of this, the exponential explosion
from exhaustive searches are far more taxing

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.600
for Go than for chess.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.780
Second, the objective of the game and the
heuristics for evaluating which player is

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.500
in a better position are much clearer for
chess than they are for Go.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.470
In chess, the objective is clear - capture
the king, and there are some basic heuristics

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.019
that can be learned to evaluate which player
is performing better.

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.299
For example, you might've heard the heuristic
of counting captured pawns as one point, knights

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.650
and bishops as three points, and so on.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.269
Heuristics like this are used for chess AIs
to focus on parts of the game tree to search

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:33.409
down.

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:37.579
In Go, there isn't an easy heuristic to figure
out who is doing better.

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:41.270
The objective of the game is to surround the
most territory, but it can be difficult to

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.549
count territory as complete secure until the
borders are complete.

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.790
One player might make some solid corner territory
early in the game, but the opponent might

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.969
be compensated with a strong wall on the outside,
which has the potential to worth more.

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:59.499
In order to succeed in Go, a computer program
cannot use brute force alone.

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:04.469
An AI needs to emulate the pattern matching
and intuition that humans perform in order

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:08.749
to short-cut the search-base and explore only
the most promising moves.

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:13.029
The addition of deep neural networks to emulate
this human-like thinking is a major contributor

00:03:13.029 --> 00:03:14.669
to Alpha Go's success.

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:18.859
Not just its ability to play at the top level,
but also its ability to generate moves that

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.139
defy conventional wisdom.

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:25.469
Ever since Alpha Go's games about Lee Sedol,
Go players at all levels have been trying

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:27.769
to learn from its style of play.

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:33.930
In January of 2017, Alpha Go played 60 online
matches against some of the world's top players,

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.680
including the top professionals of China,
Korea and Japan without losing a single game.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.709
Now, in just a few short days, Alpha Go will
show its continued learning in a series of

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:51.230
games in China, including a three-game match
against the world's top Go player, Ke Jie.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.750
Go is a game that's easy to learn, but it's
also a game that you'll learn from for an

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:56.959
entire lifetime.

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.260
I've only been playing for about a year, so
I'm still a fairly poor player, but because

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.549
of how little I know, I'm constantly seeing
and learning new things.

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:10.409
The main appeal of Go to me is the beauty
of how the game flows from its simple rules.

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:14.279
Hopefully this video has given an insight
into what makes Go such a complex game for

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:17.449
computers, and what makes it tricky for humans
as well.

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:22.550
But the best way of understanding is to try
it for yourself, and in only a few minutes,

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.290
you'll be ready to play your first game.
