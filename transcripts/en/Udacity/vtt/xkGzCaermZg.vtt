00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.150
In order to type x cubed y squared +4z,

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:09.310
what you would have to type on your
keyboard would be x carrot 3 and then

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.510
you would hit the right arrow to get
out of the exponent superscript area.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.850
And then you would hit y, and
then you would do a carrot to get

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.680
back into the superscript and
enter 2 for your exponent.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.990
Then you had the right arrow key
again to get out of the exponent and

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.880
then plus 4z.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.460
And to get 7a squared b- c to the fifth,
you would type 7a carrot 2,

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.960
right arrow key to get out of
the superscript, and then you type b and

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:44.150
then you type minus c caret 5.
