00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.350
&gt;&gt; [cheering] I am so,
so, so glad you're here.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:27.730
We are thrilled to have you.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.040
We're excited to be
in this conversation

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:36.850
and we completely honor
you for your patience.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.210
[cheering] Really.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.720
So I have a couple things that
I'm here to say and then I'm going

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.970
to introduce Jeff Kinney.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.770

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:57.500
[ Cheering ]

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.840
Wow! [laughing]

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:12.500
[ Cheering ]

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.750
So -- [crash] Oops.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.510
Sorry about that.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.250
So let me tell you a little bit
about the Library of Congress.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.200
Raise your hand if you --
this is your first time here.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.500
Welcome! Welcome.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:34.980
So it's our mission here
at the Library of Congress

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.770
to provide a very rich,
enduring source of knowledge

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.900
and it's designed to
inspire and engage you.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.180
And I am clear that you all have
some knowledge of Jeff Kinney,

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.470
some knowledge of "The
Diary of the Wimpy Kid" --

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.730
Greg, Rowley, some new
characters -- I'm a little --

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.570
my son's 13, so I haven't read
one of these in about a year.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.090
But I know some of
the characters, right?

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.850
So it's our intention --
[microphone crash] We're going

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.190
to try this again.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.490
[microphone movement]

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.790
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.490
&gt;&gt; I'm actually going to keep
talking while he does his thing

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.610
so we'll manage our
time accordingly.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.660 position:56%
So it's our intention at the center
for the book that we promote reading

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.690 position:56%
and literacy and books and
libraries and poetry and literature.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.660
And we do that because we feel
like they are the best tools

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.920 position:56%
for you all to live lives of choice.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.660
Like you get to say
how your life goes

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.400 position:56%
when you know how to read and write.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.250
And here at the Library of Congress
it's our focus to provide all kinds

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.880
of programming and
activities to do that.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.100
So today's event is one in a series
that we have -- we welcome you to.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.300
There's a special event
that's happening today.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.080
Today is not just that
Jeff Kinney is here.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.590
What else is special about today?

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.630
Does anybody know?

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.710
[inaudible responses] He's
signing the books, that's true.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.010
What book?

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.620
What's the book?

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.140 position:56%
[inaudible responses] "Double Down!"

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.230
That's right.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.720
[inaudible responses]
And what's special

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:21.380
about today is it is his first
day of the tour for that new book.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.440
[cheering] So he chose
to be here to celebrate

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.110
and introduce his eleventh book,

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.510
"Diary of a Wimpy Kid:
Double Down," with you.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:45.500
[ Cheering ]

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.340
So just so you know,
these books have been

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.420
on New York Times'
Bestsellers List for weeks.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.730
The books are translated
in 52 languages,

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.230
180 million copies have been sold.

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.310 position:56%
So imagine how many of you there are
in this room and how many of you --

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.360
how many of you have
read all 10 of the books?

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:08.970

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.500
So number 11 is just
waiting for you.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.950
How many have done like eight?

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.490
At least eight of the books?

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.500
All right, great!

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.330

to introduce who's in the room

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.220
and then we'll be ready for Jeff.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.680

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:09.550
Oh, it worked.

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:10.920
Oh, no. It didn't.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.950
Let's hit command/tab there
and go back to the pressie.

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:15.660
[phonetic] We're going
to keep having problems.

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:17.880 position:56%
Oh, hit left arrow a bunch of times.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:21.350
You're -- something's
going crazy here.

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:23.040
[laughter] Okay, right
arrow one time.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.340
Let's see how that works.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:26.850
Right arrow one time.

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:28.150
There we go.

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:29.450
There we go!

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:30.840
All right, now we're on a roll.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.660
[laughter] Okay, so
my friend and I --

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:37.150
we actually tried to build
the world's biggest snowman.

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:39.080
Has anybody here ever tried that?

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.710
Yes? We thought we could
build like a 50 foot snowman.

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:44.560
Right? It didn't work out.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.290
Instead what happened
was we tore up all

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:50.670
of the grass and the
sod in our yard.

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:54.190 position:56%
So we actually tore up my friend's
front yard with this giant snowball.

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.100
So we had this big brown meatball.

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:58.550
That's one of the things
that happened in real life.

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:00.640
One of the things -- how many
people here have an older brother

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.150
or sister?

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:05.330
Okay, they're tough sometimes.

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:10.190
One of the things that happened
to me was that my brother,

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:12.960
in the middle of the summer --
just like in "Diary of a Wimpy Kid:

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.700
One" -- he woke me up in the middle
of summer and he told me I was late

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:18.000
for my first day of school.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.980
So here's this picture.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:22.330
Right? You remember that picture?

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:24.750
&gt;&gt; Yes!

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:28.770
&gt;&gt; And then I went downstairs
and made myself breakfast

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:30.280
at about three in the morning.

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.750
So my dad found me like this.

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:37.540
Right? My friend and I
made a haunted house just

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:38.840
like Greg and Rowley did.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.790
So we scared the neighborhood kids.

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:42.950
Charged them and then scared them.

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:46.280
And let's advance to
the next slide here.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:50.260
We also did something very stupid.

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:56.290 position:56%
We had a game where I would throw a
football at my friend; not so smart.

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:57.720
And that happened.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.020
So he got hurt.

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:02.950
And also, with another friend of
mine, we actually got into a fight.

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:05.990
I don't recommend it, but
this is what it looked like.

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:09.350
We didn't know how to fight so
we kind of looked like this.

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:11.750
Right? Let's take another look.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:14.280
Yeah, that was us.

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.100
We didn't know what we were doing.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.690
And I was also on a swim
team and I hated to be

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:20.990
in the water in the cold.

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:24.240
Right? So I would go
into the locker room --

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.470
and you've probably seen
this in the books, right?

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:29.910
&gt;&gt; Yeah!

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:32.840
&gt;&gt; I was cold and so
then I did this.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.140
[laughter] Right?

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.970
So a lot of the stories in "Diary

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:41.080
of a Wimpy Kid" happened
to me in real life.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:44.360
And I would really recommend to you
guys that if you have funny things

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.820
that happen to you
in your real life,

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:48.880
write it down because you
could write 10-12 "Diary

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.640
of a Wimpy Kid" books
easy based on your lives.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.660
And so I wanted to -- I'm
going to try a technical trick.

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:55.080
Let's see if this works.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.730 position:56%
Okay, we're going to go command/tab.

00:13:56.730 --> 00:14:00.540
Right? And then go to the finder.

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.410
That's right.

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:04.710
Yeah. Almost.

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:09.150
Finder. [scared noise]
Command/tab and release.

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:10.450
We're going to do this.

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:11.750
You'll see.

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:15.860
Command/tab and release.

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:18.780
[laughs] Okay, so let's
go to the finder

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:20.140
in the bottom left hand corner.

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:22.410
You see that icon in the
bottom left hand corner?

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:23.710
Yeah, let's click on that.

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:25.010
Okay, great.

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:28.130
In a second we're going to launch
one that says, "Global Tour."

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:30.230
So I'm at the start
of a global tour.

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:31.620
This is -- I actually
wanted to start

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:33.540
where I grew up; where I started.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:37.390
And -- but last year we actually
went around the world and we're

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:39.090
about to go around the world again.

00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:41.900
So I wanted to show you a
video from last year's tour.

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.200
Is that okay?

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.500
&gt;&gt; Yeah!

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:45.800
&gt;&gt; All right, let's
see if this works.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.100
So let's hit "play."

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:48.400
Hope we get sound and everything.

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:53.160
We don't have sound.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.590
[laughs] I'll show you around.

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:57.740
Okay, so we don't have
sound, which is interesting.

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:00.360
Can we pause?

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:06.870 position:56%
No sound. Okay, so I'm just going to
show you what happened on this tour.

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:08.410
We went all over the place.

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:09.810
We went to the UK.

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:12.930
We went to Brazil.

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:14.230
You remember from the Olympics?

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:16.030
[music] Oh, here we go.

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:23.500
[ Music ]

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:26.230
Japan

00:15:26.230 --> 00:17:34.500
[ Music ]

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:42.340
Thank you guys for checking
out that video and you saw

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:43.880
that I got all the
way back to my home

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.500
in a little town called Plainville,

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.480
Massachusetts, where
I have two kids.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.810
Let's go back to the pressie.

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:50.110
So, yeah there we go.

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:51.570
We're getting the hang of it.

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.560
So I like to collect funny stories.

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:56.620
You know that's what I do
when I travel, from my life.

00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:01.500
So let's take a look
at how I collect them.

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:04.430
So I recorded everything
in a sketchpad.

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:09.650
So I had this 77 page sketchbook
and I wrote down every funny thing

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:11.320
that had ever happened to me.

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:15.640
And so as I went along I think I
started writing smaller and smaller

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:18.030
because I was afraid of
getting to the end too quickly.

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:21.800
And by the very end, the
last page looked like this.

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:24.270
So every funny thing
that ever happened to me

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:26.850
in my life was recorded
in this sketch journal.

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:30.660
And I'll tell you a story that
happened to me a few years ago.

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:35.740
We actually got to go to the
White House and see the Obamas.

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:37.970
Right? And it should
have been a great day --

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:40.970
and it was a great day -- but
I'll tell you something funny

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:42.270
that happened.

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:43.570
You can see my two boys
over there to the right --

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:44.870
Will [assumed spelling] and Grant.

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:46.310
[assumed spelling] And
they're kind of bad, right?

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:48.720
They're kind of bad kids in a way.

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.190
They're good and they're bad.

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:52.550
But one of the things they
did was they said, "Hey,

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:56.090
when you read your book on
the White House lawn we want

00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:57.390
to sit next to you."

00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:58.710
You know, "We want
to get in on that."

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:00.010
And I said, "Okay."

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:02.640
You know I knew they
were going to misbehave.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.660
So I said, "You have to behave.

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:07.090 position:56%
You can't do anything weird or -- ."

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:09.840
You know, "Hey, I'll give you ice
cream if you actually behave."

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:15.200
Right? So here are my two boys
reading and sitting next to me.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:21.640 position:56%
Right? And what I found out was that
my younger son at one point he got

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.530
up and he read out of my lap
and it was a very sweet moment.

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:25.950
He was just learning to read.

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:28.680
And then afterwards I was like you
know, "You guys were really good."

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:30.400
So I gave them some ice cream.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.490
Right? And then I found
out when I went home --

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:36.550
I watched the White House
website and I watched a tape

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:38.840
and when my younger son was
reading out of my lap --

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:41.210
let's see if I've got
the image right here.

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:44.630
Yes, my older son was spanking him.

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:47.890
[laughter] Right.

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:52.630
So now that's part of official
White House documentation now;

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:57.380
my older son spanking
my younger son.

00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:00.620
Right. So lots of funny
things have happened to me.

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:03.010
Lots of funny things have
happened to you guys.

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:06.520
When I was a kid I got really
interested in cartoons.

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.280
I wanted to be a cartoonist.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:11.100
My favorite reading was comics.

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:15.000
Right? [cheering] So I
liked Donald Duck, right?

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.310
I liked "Calvin and Hobbs."

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:17.750
Have you guys seen
"Calvin and Hobbs?"

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:19.910
&gt;&gt; Yes!

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:23.210
&gt;&gt; And "The Far Side"
was one of my favorites.

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:24.510
&gt;&gt; Yes!

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:27.340
&gt;&gt; Right? And so when I
went to college I decided

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:30.760
to create my own cartoon
character whose name was Igdoof.

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.470
[phonetic] So I'll show you
what Igdoof looked like.

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:35.760
[laughter] That was Igdoof.

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.860
I created him at the University
of Maryland and I thought

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:42.170
that I'd be able to take
Igdoof out into the world

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:44.540
and become a syndicated
newspaper cartoonist,

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:46.620
but it didn't work out for me.

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:50.580
And what I found -- I started --
you know Igdoof just has this kind

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:53.030
of weird look and you'll notice
there's one thing he's got

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:54.330
in common with Greg.

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:55.700
Do you see it?

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:57.380
[inaudible answers] His hair.

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:58.680
That's right.

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:01.830
What I found out is that there
are a lot of cartoon characters

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:04.790
who are boys who are
bald or nearly bald.

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:09.150
Can anyone tell me the most
famous nearly bald cartoon boy?

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:12.850
[inaudible answers]
Somebody said Caillou.

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:15.200
[inaudible answers] All right.

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.500
I heard Charlie Brown.

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:20.650
[inaudible answers] I
heard Charlie Brown.

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:21.950
So what I wanted to show you is

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:26.460
that here's how cartooning is
different from illustration.

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:30.200
In cartooning you're trying to
use as few lines as possible

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.370
to make the biggest impact, right?

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:37.240
So I'm going to draw a few pieces
of drawings and see if you know

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.640

those are so few lines

Woodstock from "Charlie Brown."

I didn't do a great job, but
he's kind of like this, right?

And then something like that.

Heffley, you know I think

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:52.990
that you know -- from
Greg Heffley is that --

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:55.720
I think this is all I
need for Greg Heffley.

I think you might have
guessed it from that, right?

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:02.990
So what I think would
be fun to do --

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:06.600
what I want to tell you is that I
fell in love with a cartoon strip

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:09.960
when I was in college and
it was called "Big Nate."

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:12.250
How many of you guys
have seen "Big Nate?"

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:15.680
[inaudible answers] Yeah,
so let's advance that slide.

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:22.150
[cheering] So "Big Nate," this
is one of my favorite cartoons

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:24.620
and I wrote to the author
and he wrote me back

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:28.960
and then one day I looked in the
Washington Post and I saw this;

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:33.160
Big Nate had drawn his own comic
and he put Igdoof in the comic.

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:35.000
Can you see Igdoof up there?

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.800
[inaudible answers] And can you
name the other cartoon characters

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.860 position:56%
that Igdoof is in that sticker with?

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:44.180
Just from those really
scribbly drawings?

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:48.260
Anybody? Who is in the
upper left hand corner?

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:50.570
Bart Simpson, right.

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:51.870
Who's to the right of Bart?

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:54.400
Can anybody guess it just from -- ?

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.190
I'll bet some grownups know.

00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:58.600
That's Garfield.

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:06.210
Right. [inaudible yelling] So what
I really like about cartooning is

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:09.460
that you are just trying to boil
something down to its essence.

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:13.380
So you guys did a really
good job of guessing

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:16.690
which character I was
drawing from here.

00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:23.010

Or do you need a little bit of help?

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:49.150
[inaudible answer] Okay, so drawing
Greg -- it looks really simple,

00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:52.680 position:56%
but it's actually hard because there
is so few lines that if you mess

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:55.580
up a line everything looks wrong.

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:31.290
"Double Down," right?

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:32.590
There we go.

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:34.930
And here we go.

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:39.950
Right? [yelling] Okay,
that is Silas Scratch.

00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:43.460
My dad made up that character,
Silas Scratch, and I took that idea

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:45.150
from him many, many years later.

00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:47.060
All right, we also have --

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:50.300
in another book we
have -- Santa's Scout.

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:51.600
[yelling] Right?

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:53.850
Little bit scary.

00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:57.710
And Greg's doll, which is Alfrendo.

00:30:57.710 --> 00:31:00.640
[yelling] Remember?

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.640
One of the scariest
characters in the "Diary

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:08.730
of a Wimpy Kid" books
is Nasty Pants, right?

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:12.240
And then there's a girl in Greg's
class that Greg's really afraid of.

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:15.990 position:56%
[yelling] Not -- he's afraid of her.

00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:19.230
That's Ruby Bird, right?

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:22.680
She bites the teacher and then
the tooth ends up in his arm.

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:23.980
It's really gross.

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:26.220
So in this book I wanted to
do a lot of spooky stuff.

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:28.560
How many of you guys went
out for Halloween last night?

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:31.480
[cheering] Yes.

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:35.800
[cheering] I missed my first ever
Halloween with my kids to be here.

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:39.740
But I wanted to show you -- in
this new book I've got a parody

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:41.650
of the "Goosebumps" books.

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:44.190
So I've got spine ticklers.

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:47.040
Right? Spine ticklers.

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:50.110
So these are scary books that
really catch on with the kids.

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:52.730
Let's look at another spine
ticklers book right here.

00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:54.920
"My Teacher is a Cannibal."

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:57.460
[laughing] So I have the
spine ticklers books.

00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:59.640
I have geese that chase
the kids around.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:06.760
[yelling] I have a witch that
Greg is really terrified of.

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:10.390
Now how many of you guys have
actually been scared of something

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:13.140
like this; your parent
buys a Halloween decoration

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:14.440
and it terrifies you.

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.230
Anybody? Yes.

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:21.520
So in Greg's world they put the
witch down into the basement,

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:24.260
but any little sound sets it off.

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:27.570
Right? So if you drop a napkin
upstairs the witch might go

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:28.930
off downstairs.

00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:31.810
So they actually take the
batteries out of the witch

00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:34.130
and then it still goes off.

00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:36.240
Right? Very terrifying.

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:39.760
In this book Greg and Rowley
decide to make their own movie,

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:42.430
which is called, "Night
of the Night Crawlers."

00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:46.470
It's about man eating worms.

00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:49.270
Okay? And they use gummy
worms from Halloween --

00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:55.160
left over from Halloween
-- to make their own movie.

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:57.710
So how many of you guys
have seen any of the

00:32:57.710 --> 00:33:00.230
"Diary of a Wimpy Kid" movies?

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:04.000
Good. So you guys -- if we can
get our technology to work,

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.220
you're going to see something that
no kid in the world has seen yet.

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:13.710
So right now we're
filming a new movie.

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:16.660
We're filming "The Long
Haul" in Atlanta, Georgia.

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:18.430
Right now they're filming it.

00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:22.350
And they put together a clip
so that you guys could see some

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:23.650
of the stuff that happens.

00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:26.060
But I wanted to remind you of
what happens in "The Long Haul."

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:27.890
Let's look at this.

00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:30.510
In "The Long Haul" we have the pig.

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:35.500
[ Inaudible Yelling ]

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:38.510
And Greg is carrying
the pig, that's right.

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:41.500
[ Inaudible Yelling ]

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:44.490
And they eat deep fried
butter on a stick.

00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:46.940
Right? These are things that
happened in "The Long Haul."

00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:48.240
So let's take a look.

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:51.250
Let's do command/tab
to get to the finder.

00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:53.740
Just to the finder, that's right.

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:58.040
And then let's launch one
that says, "movie teaser."

00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:59.340
So nobody's seen this yet.

00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:01.060
Let's see if this works.

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:04.720
And we're going to need the
audio before we play it.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.520
So let's not play it
until we have the audio.

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:09.500
[ Music ]

00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:12.300
Hi, my name is Jeff Kinney
and I'm the author of the

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:13.600
"Diary of a Wimpy Kid" series.

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:16.070
And I wanted to tell you about
the new movie we have coming out,

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:18.430
"Diary of a Wimpy Kid:
The Long Haul."

00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:22.860
[music] With the new movie
we have a whole new cast.

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:26.330
We've got Jason Drucker
as a pint sized Greg.

00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:28.850
[inaudible] We've got
Charlie Wright as his rock

00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:31.220
and roll older brother, Rodrick.

00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:33.450
[music] We've got Wyatt
and Dylan Walters,

00:34:33.450 --> 00:34:36.330
who actually fill the wall
of three year old Manny.

00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:39.400
We've got Tom Everett Scott,
who plays the beleaguered dad,

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:43.510 position:56%
and the loveable Alicia Silverstone,
who plays Susan Heffley.

00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:47.500

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:49.880
I can't wait for you
to see the new movie.

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:52.760
I think it's going to be the
best "Diary of a Wimpy Kid" yet.

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:56.010
So come on out and
get wimpy in 2017.

00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:59.020
[music] What do you think?

00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:00.820
[cheering] Cool.

00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:05.500
[ Cheering ]

00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:07.920
All right.

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:09.960
So there's lots of -- there are
lots of interesting things going

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:12.390
on in the "Diary of a
Wimpy Kid" world next year.

00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:14.880
That's why this is an
exciting year for me.

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:19.690
Let's take a look at
-- and one more here.

00:35:19.690 --> 00:35:25.600
[yelling] We had a balloon
in the Macy's Day Parade --

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:29.050
the Thanksgiving parade -- for six
years and now we've retired it.

00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:30.350
So we made a new balloon.

00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:33.440
So here's a sketch that
almost nobody has seen yet.

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:35.240
This is what the new
one's going to look like.

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:36.710
&gt;&gt; Cool!

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:39.740
&gt;&gt; So Greg is sort of
falling forward, right?

00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:43.770
And we also made a musical that
ran in Minneapolis this year

00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:47.340
and hopefully will
come to DC one year.

00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:50.180
But you can see that Greg is
looking down at the cheese.

00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:54.530
He's being warned not to eat
the cheese, or touch the cheese.

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:56.210
So I thought I'd do something fun.

00:35:56.210 --> 00:36:00.520
I'm going to start working
on book 12 right away, but --

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:04.990
[yell] thank you very much --
but I need to put it together.

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:09.050
So I thought maybe we could come up
with the color and the title today.

00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:10.350
Does that sound cool?

00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:11.650
&gt;&gt; Yes!

00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:17.390
&gt;&gt; All right, so I'm going to point
to three kids and you're going

00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:20.070
to tell me a title --
a color that you like.

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:24.250
Okay? So right here.

00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:25.550
[inaudible answer] Purple?

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:27.590
So we have one purple book,
but we can make another one.

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:30.070
A different shade of purple maybe?

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:31.370
Yeah? Blue?

00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:33.050
Maybe a really deep blue?

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:34.350
That would be cool.

00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:37.370
Yeah. [inaudible answers]
Did you say red?

00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:40.680 position:56%
Yeah, we have two red ones, but
maybe we could do a different shade.

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:41.980
Yeah?

00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:43.280
&gt;&gt; Yellow.

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:44.580
&gt;&gt; Yellow?

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:45.880
Right. We -- [inaudible
comment] what's that?

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:47.180
&gt;&gt; Gold.

00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:48.480
&gt;&gt; What? Oh, gold?

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:49.780
Oh, that's cool.

00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:51.080
I like that.

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:52.380
And right there?

00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:56.280
&gt;&gt; Silver?

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:57.580
That's interesting.

00:36:57.580 --> 00:36:58.880
Now how many boy -- if
we made a pink book,

00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:00.180
how many boys would still
read "Diary of a Wimpy Kid?"

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:01.480
Thank you.

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:02.780
All right, how many
boys would not read it?

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:07.520
And how many people would
be in favor of a pink book?

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:08.820
Yeah? Interesting.

00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:10.160
Okay, good to know.

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:12.900
All right, so now I want
you to do is think --

00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:14.460
okay, so we have one minute?

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:16.660
Okay, actually we'll
get that one minute.

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:20.200
So what I want you to do is --

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:22.560
you notice most "Diary of a
Wimpy Kid" books are either one

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:23.860
or two words.

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:27.300
Let's say we come up with a
two word title for this book.

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:29.740
So just think of any
random word in your mind.

00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:31.040
Don't say it.

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:33.230
Right? And we're going
to put two words together

00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:34.590
and we're going to
come up with a title.

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:37.720
Now the rule is; I'm going
to call out one of the words

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:41.490
and then you can't change your
word, no matter what is said,

00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:44.510
you cannot change your word
when I pick the second person.

00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:46.220
Okay, you raised your
hand right away.

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:47.650
Do you have your word.

00:37:47.650 --> 00:37:48.950
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:50.250

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:52.850
&gt;&gt; Banana man.

00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:54.150
[laughs] Is that one word or two?

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:55.450
Okay, let's go with banana.

00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:57.990
And then you with the pink.

00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:59.290

00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:00.590
&gt;&gt; Banana Zebra.

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:02.800

let's try this again.

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:04.350
[laughing] Okay, hold on one sec.

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:06.200
How about you, over there?

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:09.290

you name -- say one word.

microphones aren't working.

Run? Okay, run.

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:19.710
And then this guy who's
shaking his hand like that.

00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:21.350
Yeah? [inaudible response] Forkey?

00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:23.270
[phonetic] [laughing] I
have never heard that word.

00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:26.140
[laughing] Okay, we might need
to work on this a little bit.

00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:27.720
How about --

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:29.720
[ Background Conversations ]

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:32.660
How about if we go to questions.

00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:34.710
Do our microphones work?

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:36.410
Okay, our microphones work.

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:39.270
So I think we have about
10 minutes for questions.

00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:40.570
Is that about right?

00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:43.620
So let's get a mix of kids,
and if there are any teachers

00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:45.460
who have questions, or grownups --

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:47.750
adults who came in --
that would be great.

00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:50.170
So I'm going to trust you
guys to find the people

00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:52.040
to get your questions to.

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:54.780
So I'm not going to be able to
get to everybody's questions,

00:38:54.780 --> 00:39:00.390
but I am doing a signing
afterwards for those that can stay.

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:03.790
Okay. We've got this guy over here.

00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:05.090
&gt;&gt; Car.

00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:06.390
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:08.150
&gt;&gt; What's your question?

00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:11.790
&gt;&gt; What -- do you have any
idea what would the new book --

00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:14.520
the twelfth book's name will be?

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:17.070
&gt;&gt; That's -- well, it's
"Banana Zebra," obviously.

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:19.660
Right? No, we're -- you know what?

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:22.360
I usually don't have any idea
of what the books is going

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:25.110
to be all the way until
the spring of next year.

00:39:25.110 --> 00:39:27.370
But this year I do have an idea.

00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:29.990
I think it would be really
fun to do a travel --

00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:34.430
a holiday book where
something big happens.

00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:35.750
A big holiday book.

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:38.770
So "Cabin Fever" is a
really small holiday book,

00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:40.560
but I want to do a
really big holiday book.

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:43.500
So I have an idea and
I can't say too much.

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:47.810
Okay? So we're going
to trust you guys

00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:51.590
to find an audience
-- an audience member.

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:55.680
&gt;&gt; I'm Houston [assumed
spelling] and my question was;

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:58.780
what holiday is it going
to be, that you just said?

00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:01.200
Christmas or Easter or
something like that?

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:02.500
His birthday?

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:04.310
&gt;&gt; Well, if you notice
with the "Diary

00:40:04.310 --> 00:40:06.770
of a Wimpy Kid Books,"
I do them all in order.

00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:08.220
So if the last one happened

00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:10.980
in October the next one
happens in November, right?

00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:13.460
And so this is going to
be the holiday season.

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:15.830
You know for me that
would be Christmas.

00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:17.890
For other people it might
be something different,

00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:20.900
but most people celebrate
something in December

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:22.700
and that's what it's
going to be about.

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:24.210
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:26.100
&gt;&gt; Yeah?

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:29.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well my name is Chase.

00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:39.230
[assumed spelling] And do you
have any idea for the new book

00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:43.750
and like what is the story?

00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:45.050
Like -- --

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:46.370
&gt;&gt; That's a good --
I can't say too much,

00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:48.410
but something I've never
done before in the "Diary

00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:51.980
of a Wimpy Kid" books is I've
never had them travel on a plane.

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:54.500
Now how many people here
have travelled on a plane?

00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:55.800
A lot, right?

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:58.070
How many people have not
travelled on a plane yet?

00:40:58.070 --> 00:40:59.370
A good number, right?

00:40:59.370 --> 00:41:02.940
I was a teenager before I travelled
on a plane for the first time

00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:05.530
and I think it's an
interesting experience.

00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:09.150
So let's get another -- okay
we got somebody up there?

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:18.440
&gt;&gt; So are you going to like, not
only like travel on a plane, you --

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:20.850
I have a question that --

00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:26.080
are you going to like make them
like go to like hotels and -- ?

00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:28.430
&gt;&gt; Ah, yes.

00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:32.150
I can't make it too similar
to "The Long Haul," right?

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:34.160
Where they went to
all these bad motels.

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:36.620
I'm -- so I'm going to
make this book different.

00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:39.890
I think they're going to
spend time in airports.

00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:42.750 position:56%
Okay, we have another one coming up.

00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:44.190
Way up there.

00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:45.490
&gt;&gt; Tamari.

00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:50.940
[assumed spelling] [laughs] Are
you going to add new characters?

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:55.060 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Am I going to add new characters?

00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:59.530
Yes. In this new book I have a kid
named Maddox, [assumed spelling]

00:41:59.530 --> 00:42:03.070
who is really the opposite
of Greg in every way.

00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:04.840
He's very different from Greg.

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:08.950
And if you notice in -- if you open
up a "Diary of a Wimpy Kid" book,

00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:11.710
on the right hand side of
the page, the title page,

00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:14.750
there's always Greg
verses a character.

00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:16.720
And so in this book it's Maddox

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:19.410
because Maddox is really
the opposite of Greg.

00:42:19.410 --> 00:42:20.710
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:26.130
&gt;&gt; The -- on your title,
"Double Down" has like circles.

00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:29.090
Does that relate to
like cheese or -- ?

00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:30.390
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:31.690
&gt;&gt; Anything in the story?

00:42:31.690 --> 00:42:34.110
&gt;&gt; If you look at "Double Down"
you'll notice that the words look

00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:36.710
like cheese and that's
because with this book I felt

00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:38.700
like I was kind of starting over.

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:41.680
So I wanted to make this book
a lot like the first book.

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:45.420
So a lot of things that happen
in this book mirror what happened

00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:50.820
in the first book, including
the reemergence of the cheese.

00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:52.120
Okay, right here.

00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:58.360
&gt;&gt; What -- are you going to
make a book after that book?

00:42:58.360 --> 00:42:59.660
&gt;&gt; Oh, my gosh!

00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:02.080
&gt;&gt; Am I going to make
a book after that book?

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:06.200
Yes. I'm going to keep going
hopefully until I drop.

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:08.320
[laughing] So we're going to
take about two more questions

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:10.150
and then I know some
of you guys have to go.

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:14.040
Some of you are going to stay,
but let's get these two questions.

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:19.850
&gt;&gt; What was the -- when did
you start writing books?

00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:23.880
&gt;&gt; I started writing
when I was 25, right?

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:25.290
So now I'm 45.

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:26.810
So 20 years ago, right?

00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:28.110
&gt;&gt; Wow!

00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:30.700
&gt;&gt; Okay, so we're going
to do one more question.

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:32.000
Right up there.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.300
And we have two girls there.

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:34.600
So we'll get both of them.

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:35.900
We'll do two.

00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:37.900
&gt;&gt; What is "Double
Down" mainly about?

00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:41.640
&gt;&gt; "Double Down" is about Greg
trying to become a creator.

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:44.600
He learns to play a musical
instrument and he makes films.

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:49.170
His mom really wants him to get off
the video games and make something.

00:43:49.170 --> 00:43:50.950
And that last question right there?

00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:53.760
&gt;&gt; Personally, what's
your favorite book?

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:57.140
&gt;&gt; Personally my favorite book,
it's always the latest one I wrote.

00:43:57.140 --> 00:44:00.290
I'm really happy with "Double
Down," but I like "The Long Haul"

00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:03.240
because it's the most
complete book I think.

00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:06.060
I've gotten a little bit
better at this year after year.

00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:08.010
So I think that's my best.

00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:12.040
So guys, like I said, some of you
can stay and some of you can't.

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:15.590
I wanted to say first of all
again, I really apologize

00:44:15.590 --> 00:44:16.890
for not starting on time.

00:44:16.890 --> 00:44:18.190
I feel terrible about that.

00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:20.370
Thank you so much for
being so patient.

00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:23.470
Thank you for coming out here and
thank you so much to the Library

00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:25.530
of Congress for having me.

00:44:25.530 --> 00:44:27.330
[cheering] Take care!

00:44:27.330 --> 00:44:40.500
[ Cheering ]

00:44:41.050 --> 00:44:42.700
&gt;&gt; All right, how about that.

00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:45.400
I know he can hear us back there
as he's going around to set

00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:46.880
up to be able to do book signing.

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:50.250
So how about the loudest cheer
to say, "Thank you Jeff?"

00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:53.510
&gt;&gt; Thank you Jeff!

00:44:53.510 --> 00:45:03.500
[ Cheering ]

00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:05.740
&gt;&gt; So hang on.

00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:09.600
We're -- we -- just a couple
words before we dismiss.

00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:14.630
And we are going to ask that you
stay seated as much as possible.

00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:17.030
If we could have everyone
stay seated and dismiss

00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:19.570 position:56%
in an orderly fashion we'll do that.

00:45:19.570 --> 00:45:23.670
So we'd like to thank you for
being here with us at the Library

00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:28.420
of Congress and we also would like
to thank the Open Book Foundation,

00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:32.890
who provided -- is supplying some
of the books for students today.

00:45:32.890 --> 00:45:34.580
If you're a school
group and you wish

00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:37.980
to buy more books they're still
available in the vestibule

00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:45.160
and Jeff will be there doing the
book signing at the table outside.

00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:49.500
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
