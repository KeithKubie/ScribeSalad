00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.030
 
I think that that's a very complicated

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040
I think that that's a very complicated
 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.609
I think that that's a very complicated
kind of question because although I

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:13.619
kind of question because although I
 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:16.279
kind of question because although I
really feel like I never had a

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289
really feel like I never had a
 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.320
really feel like I never had a
particular obstacle that I had to

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330
particular obstacle that I had to
 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.030
particular obstacle that I had to
overcome as a female scientist I never

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:20.040
overcome as a female scientist I never
 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.420
overcome as a female scientist I never
felt that I was singled out or or having

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430
felt that I was singled out or or having
 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.589
felt that I was singled out or or having
anything done against me I do see that

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599
anything done against me I do see that
 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.490
anything done against me I do see that
when one looks at where women are in

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500
when one looks at where women are in
 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.500
when one looks at where women are in
science that there is a very large

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510
science that there is a very large
 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.479
science that there is a very large
discrepancy and then there there does

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489
discrepancy and then there there does
 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.830
discrepancy and then there there does
seem to be an inability for for women to

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840
seem to be an inability for for women to
 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.310
seem to be an inability for for women to
get to a higher echelon xin in the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320
get to a higher echelon xin in the
 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.590
get to a higher echelon xin in the
scientific hierarchy or in in academia

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600
scientific hierarchy or in in academia
 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.889
scientific hierarchy or in in academia
so I think that although I didn't feel

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899
so I think that although I didn't feel
 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.470
so I think that although I didn't feel
like I had any anything done personally

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480
like I had any anything done personally
 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.959
like I had any anything done personally
to me I think that there may be more

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969
to me I think that there may be more
 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.029
to me I think that there may be more
subtle social interactions at play in

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039
subtle social interactions at play in
 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.729
subtle social interactions at play in
the scientific world that that does have

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739
the scientific world that that does have
 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.430
the scientific world that that does have
a little bit of a negative effect on

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440
a little bit of a negative effect on
 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.560
a little bit of a negative effect on
women advancing in their careers

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570
 
 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.870
 
I think that as more women get into

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880
I think that as more women get into
 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.670
I think that as more women get into
higher levels of science and as as it's

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680
higher levels of science and as as it's
 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.910
higher levels of science and as as it's
very clear to younger women coming in to

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920
very clear to younger women coming in to
 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.070
very clear to younger women coming in to
the field that yes it is possible to get

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080
the field that yes it is possible to get
 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.920
the field that yes it is possible to get
to the higher ranks that will will help

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930
to the higher ranks that will will help
 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.710
to the higher ranks that will will help
and also I think that the way that that

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720
and also I think that the way that that
 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.820
and also I think that the way that that
women run meetings and when when the

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830
women run meetings and when when the
 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.400
women run meetings and when when the
power structure is is such that you have

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410
power structure is is such that you have
 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.950
power structure is is such that you have
a larger representation of women at

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960
a larger representation of women at
 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.170
a larger representation of women at
higher levels that the conversation may

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180
higher levels that the conversation may
 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.630
higher levels that the conversation may
change somewhat and so that could also

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640
change somewhat and so that could also
 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.200
change somewhat and so that could also
be helpful moving forward

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210
 
 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.730
 
just follow what you're excited about I

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740
just follow what you're excited about I
 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:51.900
just follow what you're excited about I
would say the same thing to female

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910
would say the same thing to female
 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.640
would say the same thing to female
scientists as to male scientists to all

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650
scientists as to male scientists to all
 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.310
scientists as to male scientists to all
all young people really the the fun

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320
all young people really the the fun
 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.070
all young people really the the fun
thing is to be able to do something that

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080
thing is to be able to do something that
 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.380
thing is to be able to do something that
excites you a lot of times what we do is

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390
excites you a lot of times what we do is
 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.720
excites you a lot of times what we do is
a lot of hard work but hard work is

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730
a lot of hard work but hard work is
 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.090
a lot of hard work but hard work is
actually ok if you really are engaged in

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100
actually ok if you really are engaged in
 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.880
actually ok if you really are engaged in
it and so that really i think is that is

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890
it and so that really i think is that is
 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:09.990
it and so that really i think is that is
the main thing is finding something that

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000
the main thing is finding something that
 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.030
the main thing is finding something that
you're passionate about and and be able

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040
you're passionate about and and be able
 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.580
you're passionate about and and be able
to follow that
