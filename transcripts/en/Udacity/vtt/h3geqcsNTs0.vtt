00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now I can actually use this equation again to solve for Vy.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
That would be the final velocity after 8 seconds just before it hits the ground.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Can you solve for Vy?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Be very careful with your sign.

00:00:12.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Is this going to be a positive or a negative velocity? Enter your answer here.
