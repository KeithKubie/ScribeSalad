1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,990
Yeah. So when you were a kid,
you were, you were doing this,

2
00:00:03,991 --> 00:00:08,060
like you've been involved. So this
is like the family business, sort of.

3
00:00:08,061 --> 00:00:12,710
My family businesses, my mom's business
actually was safari businesses, so like,

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:16,420
like you say, sit in a land rover,
CD, animals kind of thing. Um,

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,740
and they did a little bit
of tourists walking safaris.

6
00:00:18,741 --> 00:00:22,460
But then I grew up on a farm in the
outskirts of some of Harare, Zimbabwe.

7
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:26,060
And then whenever I wasn't in school,
I was on the farm run around barefoot,

8
00:00:26,061 --> 00:00:30,350
catching snakes, fishing, Yada Yada.
And then when my mom wasn't booked up,

9
00:00:30,351 --> 00:00:33,470
she had this little Bush plane that she
used for safaris and we'd just adventure

10
00:00:33,471 --> 00:00:38,430
all over Africa. Wow. So it was
great childhood. That sounds amazing,

11
00:00:38,431 --> 00:00:40,890
but fucking terrifying.
I mean,

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,920
it's like one of those things where
it's what you're used to write.

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,420
I found moving to the states at age 14
and like trying to find my place in the

14
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:51,360
world, be in this weird little
private school kid from Africa,

15
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,060
way more terrifying than going to meet a
tribe in the middle of the Bush, really?

16
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,060
For sure. Yeah. Why? Um,
like I'll give you examples.

17
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,180
Like I always carry a pocket knife on me,
right? My first day here in the states,

18
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,030
I go to school, pull my pocket,
I'm sitting in my like uniform.

19
00:01:06,031 --> 00:01:09,360
So I went to a very proper English
boarding school, pull out my pocket knife,

20
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:13,440
start cutting my apple. 15 minutes
later I'm in handcuffs and I'm like,

21
00:01:13,441 --> 00:01:16,320
what did I do? What did I do? I literally
had no idea what I had done wrong,

22
00:01:16,321 --> 00:01:17,640
but because I had a knife at school,

23
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,820
everybody I had ever been to school
with had a knife to cut their apple.

24
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,770
Like it was the standard thing. So here
I am with like police and you know,

25
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,170
guns and badges and they're throwing me
in handcuffs and taking me out of the

26
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,240
school on day one in America.
And I'm like,

27
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,070
this is the scariest thing I've ever seen.

28
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,400
And I didn't even learn until later that
day that it was because I had a pocket

29
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:38,310
knife. And at no point did I think
having a pocket knife is a bad thing.

30
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,480
So they didn't tell you? No,
they just grabbed me. There
was like this whole thing,

31
00:01:42,481 --> 00:01:45,360
like the knife went flying, I was chained
up and I was like, what's going on?

32
00:01:45,361 --> 00:01:49,410
What's going on? And they're like, you're
in big trouble and ask why. And uh,

33
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,020
you know, it was like little
culture shock, things like that.

34
00:01:52,021 --> 00:01:56,040
That to me where like something I'd done
everyday my whole life and now I'm like

35
00:01:56,041 --> 00:02:00,320
getting thrown in Juvie for it kind of
thing. When you think back about that,

36
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,890
do you think that's just the consequences
of being in a large population?

37
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:07,490
For sure. Yeah. Yeah. I
mean like we, like I say,

38
00:02:07,491 --> 00:02:10,070
I went to school everyday with a knife.
There was no violence issues,

39
00:02:10,071 --> 00:02:12,670
there was nothing like that. But
then you come here where, you know,

40
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,320
the stabbings and stuff like that and
it's because, you know, we had a tie.

41
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,320
I lived in a tiny country
with a tiny population.

42
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,920
Do you think that it's possible
that I may, I mean stupid,

43
00:02:21,921 --> 00:02:25,040
but there's no way you could
live like that over here. I mean,

44
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:28,910
there's no way you can have kids with a
bunch of knives. No, I don't. Culture,

45
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,520
I don't. Yeah, I don't think so at
all. I think that would be terrible.

46
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,530
And I get it now as an adult.

47
00:02:33,531 --> 00:02:37,100
Nobody talked to you about it before you
left the house? No, my mom didn't know.

48
00:02:37,101 --> 00:02:41,080
She's from Africa. You know, she's like,
here are your things, here's my cool.

49
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,540
But it might be shared. Sharpen it
before you get to tell a man. Wow.

50
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,120
So you were doing these always
doing these walking safaris. You,

51
00:02:49,121 --> 00:02:51,860
you started out doing the driving ones
and then eventually you started doing the

52
00:02:51,861 --> 00:02:55,310
walking ones? My family
business did walking's as far
as they didn't do hunting,

53
00:02:55,311 --> 00:02:58,370
it was all photographic. Um, and
we were in the Zambezi valley,

54
00:02:58,371 --> 00:03:00,370
so as Mbz River's one of the
biggest rivers in the world.

55
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,670
So we do these walking safaris and
then we did canoes safaris as well,

56
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:07,120
which is why I have so many hippo and
croc stories cause we'd be canoeing down

57
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:11,290
the Zambezi river. Um, and then taking
photographs and seeing wildlife that way.

58
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,770
Wow. What a crazy way to
grow up, man. It was awesome.

59
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,300
Your relationship to wildlife,

60
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:20,470
it's just so different than the average
person in this country. For sure.

61
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:24,010
It's very intimate. Like
I, I, I feel like I have,

62
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,500
like regardless of being
a scientist by trade,

63
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:29,620
I feel like I have a very intimate
understanding of animals cause I grew up

64
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:33,070
completely surrounded by them. Now
what other countries have you explored?

65
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:37,510
I'm over 60 countries now. Yeah. So a lot.

66
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,200
All for wildlife work.
Um,

67
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:43,660
whether it's for the show that I do or
for biology contracts before I did the

68
00:03:43,661 --> 00:03:47,710
show or just because like for instance,
when I got done with college, I was like,

69
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,650
I had a little tiny little business
starting college, sold it and was like,

70
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:53,170
I'm going to travel the world and
try and photograph these animals.

71
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,240
And I went to 28 countries
looking for wildlife.
