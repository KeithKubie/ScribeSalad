Hi, I'm Kobig from
the Google Play team.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.250
Every developer dreams of their
app going big, really big.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.040
The key is making an app
that users really love.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.710
If you reach out,
listen, and respond,

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.550
you can grow your community.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.340
First, you need to make an app
that people will really want.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.490
Does it entertain them, help
them be more productive?

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.880
It's important to figure out
who is your target customer.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.110
Reach out.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.260
A passionate group
of early adopters

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.380
can be really important
to refining your app

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.250
and helping you gain traction.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.510
Figure out who those people
are and where those people go--

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.180
social media, blogs,
conferences, whatever.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.310
In Korea, we've
heard from developers

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.790
that, because they are
attracting PC gamers,

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.750
they go to public
forums for PC gamers

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.830
to announce upcoming games.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.230
We've also heard from developers
about using a local agency

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.990
or hiring a community manager
to reach out to their users.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.330
Listen!

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.195
Once you've identified
the people who

00:01:01.195 --> 00:01:04.019
can't wait to try your
app, talk to them.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.120
Get information about
what they're looking for.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.010
Get their feedback on your
early ideas and prototypes.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.010
Set up a Google group
or a Google+ community,

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.780
so that your users
can talk to you.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.170
If your app is a secret,
make the group private.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.820
Shhhh.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.010
Listen!

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.530
When you're first version
is ready to test, publish

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.410
to alpha or beta testers
and collect feedback.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.280
Why are there are
two different groups?

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.710
Well, you may want to test the
earliest version with a trusted

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.400
group of friends and
family as an alpha test.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.880
Tell them to beware of bugs.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.850
When there's enough
positive feedback,

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.930
push your version to a
larger group of beta testers.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.140
And when your app
is ready, ship it.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.290
Recognize the contribution of
your alpha and beta testers.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.400
Mention specific new features
in your product updates.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.320
Reply directly to user
posts in the community.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.530
And add a special thanks
section to your game credits.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.080
Users love to see the
impact of their feedback.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.540
So now you have a great
app, a passionate group

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.370
of early adopters, and your
app is starting to take off.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:11.610
What's next?

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.530
Well, you'll want
to figure out what

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.670
users are doing in your app.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.500
An easy and free
way to do that is

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.490
to integrate Google
Analytics into your app.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.180
It's part of the Google
Play Services SDK

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.470
and can be enabled with
just a single line of code.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.560
You can see how many people
use your app on a daily basis.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.370
And you can even track what
parts of your app people

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.170
use most.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.270
Once you've hooked
up Google Analytics,

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.600
you can link it up with the
Google Play Developer Console.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.190
If you do this, you'll see
your new users and active users

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.380
directly in the Dev console.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.620
All of this data will help
you tweak how your app works

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.410
and make sure that you're
investing the most in ways

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.730
to reach new users.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.450
Make sure there
are ways in the app

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.730
to encourage users to
invite their friends.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.530
When we ask users how
they find new apps,

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.860
one of the most common
reasons they mention

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.790
is hearing about
it from a friend.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.350
Find good ways to reward users
who invite others to join in.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.710
Respond!

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.400
New apps aren't perfect.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.540
We've all seen bugs before.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.660
Show your users that you care
and respond to the issues

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:21.770
they raise.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.800
Make sure that there
are clear ways for users

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.320
to report problems both on
your Google Play store listing

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.530
and within your app.

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.990
And be sure to respond
quickly to user questions.

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.690
Google Play allows you to
respond to user reviews,

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.410
and your responses are
displayed on the Play store.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.200
Any future users who
visit your store listing

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.650
will see how responsive
you are to users,

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.320
and that you're committed
to improving your app.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.390
User reviews will
help you figure out

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.380
what parts of your app
need the most improvement.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.210
By being responsive, you'll
see your user ratings improve.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.300
As you get more reviews,
analyzing your users' sentiment

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.520
is important.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.030
This is why soon we will allow
you to download your user

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.610
reviews for the Dev console.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.690
To protect users
against a bad experience

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.410
and to protect your reviews,
you can also use staged rollout

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.710
to release new versions to only
a percentage of your users.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.870
So if there's a bug, you
can find out and fix it

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.070
before it hits everyone.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.600
You can also let
users know what's

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.500
going on with your latest
version by updating the what's

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.510
new text of your new APK.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.500
Making sure that your current
users are happy and engaged

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.340
is the best way to further
grow your user base,

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.670
because happy users
spread the word.

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.970
As you continue to add
new features to your app,

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.070
working with beta testers,
responding to user feedback,

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.730
and seeing how users
react to your changes,

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.520
will help you create
a community of users

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.400
who are passionate
about your app.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.040
Here at the Google
Play team, we hope

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.660
you have great success
building your user community.
