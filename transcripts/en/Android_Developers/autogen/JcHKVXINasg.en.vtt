00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.700
 
we have developed platform to build

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710
we have developed platform to build
 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.890
we have developed platform to build
wearable health solutions that can track

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900
wearable health solutions that can track
 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.530
wearable health solutions that can track
people at home and do things that they

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540
people at home and do things that they
 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.630
people at home and do things that they
usually do in hospital or they're not

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640
usually do in hospital or they're not
 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.849
usually do in hospital or they're not
done at all so what you have today is on

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859
done at all so what you have today is on
 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.739
done at all so what you have today is on
one hand yet consumer devices are very

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:21.749
one hand yet consumer devices are very
 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:23.989
one hand yet consumer devices are very
comfortable but on a very accurate on

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:23.999
comfortable but on a very accurate on
 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:25.729
comfortable but on a very accurate on
the other hand you have medical devices

00:00:25.729 --> 00:00:25.739
the other hand you have medical devices
 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:27.950
the other hand you have medical devices
they're not comfortable at all and so

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960
they're not comfortable at all and so
 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.689
they're not comfortable at all and so
what we do what bite fights we combine

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699
what we do what bite fights we combine
 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.300
what we do what bite fights we combine
both or vision is to enable wearable

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:32.310
both or vision is to enable wearable
 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:33.740
both or vision is to enable wearable
health we want to make sure that

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750
health we want to make sure that
 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.480
health we want to make sure that
everybody can use our platform and our

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:35.490
everybody can use our platform and our
 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.730
everybody can use our platform and our
dream is that every medical verbal will

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:37.740
dream is that every medical verbal will
 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.680
dream is that every medical verbal will
be developed on the whiteflies platform

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690
be developed on the whiteflies platform
 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.840
be developed on the whiteflies platform
to make that possible we collaborate

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850
to make that possible we collaborate
 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.520
to make that possible we collaborate
with Android things because Android

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530
with Android things because Android
 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.710
with Android things because Android
already build a whole community for app

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720
already build a whole community for app
 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.570
already build a whole community for app
development and they made possible that

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:47.580
development and they made possible that
 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.340
development and they made possible that
everybody that wants to build an app and

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350
everybody that wants to build an app and
 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.740
everybody that wants to build an app and
bring it to the community can do so from

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750
bring it to the community can do so from
 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.690
bring it to the community can do so from
the start when we started building a

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700
the start when we started building a
 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.430
the start when we started building a
byte flash platform we didn't want to

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440
byte flash platform we didn't want to
 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.830
byte flash platform we didn't want to
reinvent the wheel so for us you want to

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840
reinvent the wheel so for us you want to
 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.360
reinvent the wheel so for us you want to
focus really on the things where we can

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370
focus really on the things where we can
 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.850
focus really on the things where we can
make a difference and tap into existing

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860
make a difference and tap into existing
 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.460
make a difference and tap into existing
solutions existing technologies existing

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470
solutions existing technologies existing
 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.590

platforms that do it much better than we

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600
platforms that do it much better than we
 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.420
platforms that do it much better than we
do and that's a very important part of

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430
do and that's a very important part of
 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.700
do and that's a very important part of
using Android things is that we can tap

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710
using Android things is that we can tap
 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.000
using Android things is that we can tap
into the infrastructure but also the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010
into the infrastructure but also the
 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.070
into the infrastructure but also the
stack that is already set up talking

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080
stack that is already set up talking
 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.690
stack that is already set up talking
about security is talking about privacy

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700
about security is talking about privacy
 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.030
about security is talking about privacy
talking about over-the-air updates that

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040
talking about over-the-air updates that
 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.950
talking about over-the-air updates that
we don't have to do ourselves as well

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960
we don't have to do ourselves as well
 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.719
we don't have to do ourselves as well
because that's something we're Google

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729
because that's something we're Google
 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.250
because that's something we're Google
and Android and Android thinks is very

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260
and Android and Android thinks is very
 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.440
and Android and Android thinks is very
strong at and then we can focus on

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450
strong at and then we can focus on
 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.080
strong at and then we can focus on
accurate data collection the seamless

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090
accurate data collection the seamless
 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.090
accurate data collection the seamless
collection to the cloud and signal

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100
collection to the cloud and signal
 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.190
collection to the cloud and signal
processing which are our strong points

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200
processing which are our strong points
 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.690
processing which are our strong points
and we don't have to worry too much

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700
and we don't have to worry too much
 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.820
and we don't have to worry too much
about the other parts while still

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830
about the other parts while still
 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.460
about the other parts while still
knowing that we get very good quality

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470
knowing that we get very good quality
 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.920
knowing that we get very good quality
then we integrated Android things in our

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930
then we integrated Android things in our
 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.080
then we integrated Android things in our
docking stations which you can consider

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090
docking stations which you can consider
 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.760
docking stations which you can consider
as a small computer that sits at the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770
as a small computer that sits at the
 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.070
as a small computer that sits at the
bedside of the patient so basically

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080
bedside of the patient so basically
 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.170
bedside of the patient so basically
where the sensor for the full day or for

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180
where the sensor for the full day or for
 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.820
where the sensor for the full day or for
a longer period and at a given moment

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830
a longer period and at a given moment
 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.920
a longer period and at a given moment
they plug it into a docking station and

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930
they plug it into a docking station and
 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.870
they plug it into a docking station and
because of Android thinks it connects to

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880
because of Android thinks it connects to
 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.780
because of Android thinks it connects to
the cloud easily every button that a

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790
the cloud easily every button that a
 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.550
the cloud easily every button that a
patient needs to press as one too many

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560
patient needs to press as one too many
 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.700
patient needs to press as one too many
we do automatic updates patient doesn't

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710
we do automatic updates patient doesn't
 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.950
we do automatic updates patient doesn't
even know it we can deploy as many units

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960
even know it we can deploy as many units
 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.899
even know it we can deploy as many units
as we wants we have the whole Google

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:08.909
as we wants we have the whole Google
 

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:10.969
as we wants we have the whole Google
cloud we have the whole tensorflow

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979
cloud we have the whole tensorflow
 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.979
cloud we have the whole tensorflow
technology that is all embedded in

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989
technology that is all embedded in
 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.619
technology that is all embedded in
Android things so it's a very strong

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629
Android things so it's a very strong
 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.390
Android things so it's a very strong
framework where you can you just piggy

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400
framework where you can you just piggy
 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.309
framework where you can you just piggy
back to the tool that we want and build

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319
back to the tool that we want and build
 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:20.600
back to the tool that we want and build
our own technology on top of that

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610
our own technology on top of that
 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.420
our own technology on top of that
sometimes you want to develop everything

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430
sometimes you want to develop everything
 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.770
sometimes you want to develop everything
from scratch and that's actually the

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780
from scratch and that's actually the
 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.400
from scratch and that's actually the
worst thing you can do we designed our

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410
worst thing you can do we designed our
 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.890
worst thing you can do we designed our
platform in a way that we handle that

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900
platform in a way that we handle that
 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.479
platform in a way that we handle that
data with care and then it's HIPAA

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489
data with care and then it's HIPAA
 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.820
data with care and then it's HIPAA
compliant but because of Android things

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830
compliant but because of Android things
 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.520
compliant but because of Android things
we have better control to make sure that

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530
we have better control to make sure that
 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.610
we have better control to make sure that
security and privacy is controlled from

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620
security and privacy is controlled from
 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.440
security and privacy is controlled from
the moment it leaves the device and it

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450
the moment it leaves the device and it
 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.809
the moment it leaves the device and it
leaves the patient until it gets to the

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819
leaves the patient until it gets to the
 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.729
leaves the patient until it gets to the
cloud and until it's being processed

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739
cloud and until it's being processed
 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.430
cloud and until it's being processed
there we have the vision that in five to

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440
there we have the vision that in five to
 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.589
there we have the vision that in five to
ten years there's gonna be an abundance

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599
ten years there's gonna be an abundance
 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.210
ten years there's gonna be an abundance
of Health wearables that gonna change

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220
of Health wearables that gonna change
 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.920
of Health wearables that gonna change
healthcare and gonna change health of

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930
healthcare and gonna change health of
 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.990
healthcare and gonna change health of
everyone around we want that these

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000
everyone around we want that these
 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.880
everyone around we want that these
health wearables are built in by flash

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890
health wearables are built in by flash
 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.369
health wearables are built in by flash
platform that's gonna allow to transform

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379
platform that's gonna allow to transform
 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:04.400
platform that's gonna allow to transform
healthcare from being 99% curing today

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410
healthcare from being 99% curing today
 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.750
healthcare from being 99% curing today
to hopefully 99% prevention
