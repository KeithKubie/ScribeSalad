we're finally reopening
Camp Brickleberry,

00:00:16.181 --> 00:00:18.151 align:end position:100%
and you're all gonna be
camp counselors.

00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:19.452
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:21.587
Woody, this park is
a dangerous place for children.

Jackubowski
wants the camp reopened.

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:26.993 align:end position:100%
And it gives
the park a chance

00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:30.130 align:end position:100%
to make a buttload of money
off some sucker parents.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.265 align:end position:100%
So you sure as shit
better show them a good time.

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:34.033
So we're supposed to chase
these kids around

00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:35.935
and do all this extra work?
What do we get?

00:00:36.035 --> 00:00:38.871
Well, the counselor
whose tribe is voted the best

00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:40.306

There's no way I'm letting you
be a counselor again.
