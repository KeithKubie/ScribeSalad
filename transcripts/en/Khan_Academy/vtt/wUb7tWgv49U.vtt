00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.000
In the last video, we estimated
the solution to e to the x

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.340
is equal to 1 over x times
x minus 1 times x minus 2

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.260
using a calculator.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.910
We got a first rough estimate
by just looking at this graph,

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.050
and then we tried values out to
truly zero in on, or get close

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.637
to the x value
where this is true.

00:00:17.637 --> 00:00:19.220
What I now want to
do is actually just

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.710
use the graphing functionality
of this calculator

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.880
to try to estimate the
solution graphically.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.710
So let's go to Graph, and
what I'm going to try to do

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.271
is graph both of
these functions.

00:00:31.271 --> 00:00:32.770
So the first
function-- let me clear

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.270
this-- the first
one is e of x, which

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.780
on the graphing
calculator will be y1.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.750
And that's going to
be e to the x power,

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.720
and then the second
one, y2, will

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.090
be r of x, which is
going to be 1 divided

00:00:50.090 --> 00:01:02.350
by x times x minus
1 times x minus 2.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.040
And so, let's see.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.830
I have to close this
parentheses as well.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.170
So I've entered it in the graph.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.410
And I care about
where we zoom in,

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.590
so I really want to zoom
into this part of the graph

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.490
right over here.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.710
So let me go to the Range.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.960
So, actually there's also a Zoom
functionality that I could use,

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.200
but let's-- actually,
let me do that.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.872
That could be fun, so
let's just graph it.

00:01:29.872 --> 00:01:31.330
Actually, let's
just see what range

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.110
it's graphed at right now.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.850
Let's see.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.220
What we would care
about, let's start

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.200
with a rough
approximation, just to see

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.290
that this is indeed
the same graph.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.082
So let's start with x
going from 0 up to-- I

00:01:45.082 --> 00:01:49.070
don't know-- 3, so this would
be this part of the graph

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.250
right over here.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.600
And then the x scale is 1.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.000
That's what they'll
mark off, every 1.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.180
We could even mark off
every 0.5 if we want.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.660
Like this one is
marked off every 0.5.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.820
And the y minimum, let's go
from 0 to-- on this range,

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.330
actually it goes pretty high,
and the way this is graphed,

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.800
it goes all the way up to,
looks like 10, so I'll go 10.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.610
I'll leave the y scale as 1.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.200
They mark it off every
1 right over here.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.750
And now let's graph this thing.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.700
And that was e of x, and
now it's graphing r of x.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.580
And you see it
indeed looks pretty

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.380
similar to what we have here.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.320
Now what we care about is this
point, or on our calculator,

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.560
this point right over here.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.540
We want to figure
out what x value--

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.900
what is the x-coordinate of
this point of intersection?

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.950
This is when our two functions
are equal to each other.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.170
So let me zoom in on this.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.880
I think I can use this
Box functionality.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.010
So it essentially lets me
construct a box around this,

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.260
and it's going to
zoom into that box.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.140
So I'm going to get as tight
in on this as I can go.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.610
So if I press, I can
get even tighter on it.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.160
So if I press Enter, now I
can define the other corner

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.700
of the box, so
that's pretty good.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.640
I'm going to zoom
in, press Enter,

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.220
and that's zoomed in on
to that little teeny box.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.090
So that was e of x, and now
it's going to graph r of x.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.860
So now let me try
to trace the graph.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.230
So let's see.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.500
Trace, so it's letting
me trace e of x.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.510
And let's see.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.280
If I look at my x values
decrease-- so at this point,

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.530
e of x is still
higher than r of x.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:39.790
And if we get right over here--
so 2.056, we see that r of x

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.270
is above e of x.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.670
We just see that
graphically, and then we're

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.430
left of the point
of intersection.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.020
And then we're still left of
the point of intersection.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.910
Now we're right of the
point of intersection,

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.660
so it looks like the
point of intersection

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:02.760
is between 2.057 and 2.059.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.260
And so in the
previous video when

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.490
we said where our
estimate was 2.06,

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.640
we were definitely within 0.01
of the point of intersection.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.038
If we did want to get even more
precise, we could zoom in more,

00:04:18.038 --> 00:04:20.329
and I encourage you if you've
got a graphing calculator

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.463
like this to actually
try that out.
