&gt;&gt; While his role in that position was administrative, Truman sought night classes at the Kansas City School of Law, Kansas City's only law school, which was located in a downtown office building above a piano store.
All of the classes were held at night and the tuition was $80 a year.

&gt;&gt; The faculty consisted of local attorneys and a student's grade was based entirely on a final examination.
Truman took a total of fourteen courses, studying subjects like contracts, trusts, criminal law, sales law, and Blackstone's Commentaries.

&gt;&gt; Ultimately, Truman did not complete the program. He later recalled that his work for the county did not leave him with enough time for his studies.
In 1945, the school, which by then had become part of the University of Kansas City, awarded him an honorary degree.
One of Truman's classmates, Charles E. Whittaker, went on to serve as an Associate Justice of Supreme Court of the United States from 1957 - 1962.

Its acquisition complement the Law Library's small, but growing collection of handwritten documents produced by noteworthy Americans in the course of their legal careers.
