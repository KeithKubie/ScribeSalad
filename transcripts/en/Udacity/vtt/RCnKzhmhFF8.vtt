So, it's clear that we let our personal biases and opinions and

00:00:03.195 --> 00:00:05.320
preferences really affect this feature list

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.355
for the perfect Android pizza application.

00:00:07.355 --> 00:00:09.760
&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is a really common problem, and this is

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.320
a very bad thing. But, this even happens to experienced Android designers

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.320
and developers. So, what happens is when you try and design

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.460
a feature list with no user in mind, really bad things happen.
