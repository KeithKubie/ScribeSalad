00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Evans] We'll have 1 more quiz about using lists.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It will combine many of the things that we've learned.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
After this quiz we'll be ready to build our web crawler.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
For this quiz your goal is to define a procedure, named union,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that takes 2 lists as its input.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It should modify the value of the first input list

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
so when union returns its value is now the union of the 2 input lists.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
When we compute a set union,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
we want to add all the elements in the second list to the first list,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
except if they already exist.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We shouldn't be creating any duplicate elements by adding elements that already exist.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So here are a few examples.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
If you start with the variable a, referring to the list 1, 2, 3,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and the variable b, referring to the list 2, 4, 6,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
then we call union, passing in a and b.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
After the call, the value of a should be the list 1, 2, 3, 4, 6.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We've added the elements of b to a, except we skipped the first element,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
the value 2, since 2 already exists in a.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I should mention that union should not modify the value of b.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000
After the call to union (a, b), the value that b refers to should still be the list 2, 4, 6.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So see if you can define the union procedure as described here.
