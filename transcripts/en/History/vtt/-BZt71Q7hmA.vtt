00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:01.960
NARRATOR: Huntsville, Alabama.

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.380
July 24, 1969.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.620
A crowd of thousands
gathers in Courthouse Square

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.040
to cheer on the triumphant
return of Dr. Wernher von

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.040
Braun, just hours
after Apollo 11's

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.670
Columbia command module splashed
down in the Pacific Ocean.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.880
The United States
had achieved what

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.420
many believed was impossible--

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.080
putting a man on the moon.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.250
The picture ran in
newspapers around America

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.580
the following day,
celebrating the genius rocket

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.080
engineer who was behind it all.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.750
Von Braun is a titan.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.250
You know, he's one of the major
figures of the last century.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.250
And he was way
ahead of his time.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.920
Von Braun adamantly believed
that humanity's future

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.330
was in space.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.170
He's the greatest voice
we've had in the history

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.750
of the space program.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.500
NARRATOR: Considered by NASA
to be the father of rocket

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.170
science, von Braun is
credited with either inventing

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.420
or helping to develop many
of the most sophisticated

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.120
aerial technologies
that exist today,

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.540
like the supersonic
anti-aircraft missile,

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.120
the ballistic missile, the
first American satellite,

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.790
and the first US space
vehicles, including

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.290
the enormous Saturn
V rocket that

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.880
enabled man to reach the moon.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.750
Without exaggeration,
the Apollo program

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.880
has been called the greatest
achievement that mankind

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.380
has ever accomplished.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.540
Without Wernher
von Braun, we would

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.920
not have reached the moon.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.460
To date, the Saturn V
is the most powerful

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.540
rocket that we've ever built.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.460
NARRATOR: Von Braun's
incredible engineering feats

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.500
were matched only by his
all-consuming crusade

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.500
to send man into space.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.000
But who exactly was
this engineering

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.120
genius with such extraordinary
visions for the future?

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.500
Wernher von Braun was born
March 23, 1912, in a small town

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.830
in eastern Prussia.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.250
The second of
three sons, Wernher

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.000
grew up a child of
wealth and privilege.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.080
But while he was born into
an accomplished family,

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.920
Wernher's keen intellect and
unusual passions stood out.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.500
His father once said, I don't
know where his talent comes

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.670
from, and stated on
more than one occasion

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.500
that he considered
his son a mystery.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.710
CHRIS IMPEY: Wernher Von
Braun was multitalented.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.540
Both sides of his
brain were working.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.210
He could think about
technical things

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.500
and imagine rocketry
and space travel,

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.620
but he was an
accomplished musician.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.170
And these traits
manifested very early.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.620
I think his parents knew by
the time he was four or five

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.210
that he was very special.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.460
His mother gave him a
telescope when he was young,

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.830
and he looked at the moon
and said, I want to go there.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.290
I want to build the machine
that will go to the moon.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.040
And of course, he did
half a century later.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.380
The achievement of
putting a man on the moon

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.540
is something that was, at the
time, really almost impossible

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.120
and almost unthinkable.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.000
Wernher von Braun was obsessed
with going to the moon

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.710
and going to Mars from the
time he was a little boy,

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.540
and that was his destiny.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.540
NARRATOR: In his
teens, von Braun

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.750
wrote papers on orbital flight.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.250
And by the incredibly
young age of 20,

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.500
he was named the head of
Germany's rocket program

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.250
by army artillery officer
Captain Walter Dornberger.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.420
CHRIS IMPEY: When he worked
towards one of his goals,

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.000
he would apply
himself and master

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.080
a subject in very short order.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.670
He'd been trained
as an engineer.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.420
Doing a PhD in physics
is not trivial.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.210
And he got his PhD at an age
when most German students

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.880
were still undergraduates.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.830
NARRATOR: But how is it that
Wernher von Braun, whose

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.750
contemporaries included such
scientific geniuses as Nikola

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.500
Tesla, Robert Oppenheimer,
and Albert Einstein,

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.620
was so far ahead of everyone
when it came to rocketry?

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.750
And what was behind
his obsession

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.790
to travel to the stars?

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.620
Some ancient astronaut
theorists believe

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.790
that the boy genius
may have been

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.790
guided by otherworldly forces.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.080
CHRIS IMPEY: Maybe he
drew his inspiration

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.040
from science fiction, maybe it
came from his own imagination

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.120
and vision of what
the future should be,

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.750
or maybe it was inspired by
something extraterrestrial.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.710
DAVID WILCOCK: Some sort
of extraterrestrial contact

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:21.880
might have happened
with Wernher von Braun.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.920
Something or someone
might have reached him,

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.620
and saw where we needed
to go as a civilization

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.170
and gave him the
tools and the insights

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.290
that he needed to be able to
build our way out into space.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.460
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: Some
have suggested that people

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.500
like Albert Einstein,
Tesla, that they've

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.790
had this extraterrestrial
intervention,

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.460
that they have had access to
this abundance of knowledge.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.920
And the question has arisen,
did Wernher von Braun,

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.330
was he also one of them?

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.790
Because the vision
he had, the ideas

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.790
were incredible for their time.
