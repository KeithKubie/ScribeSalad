so Tom you asked the question how does

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:10.269
so Tom you asked the question how does
 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:12.959
so Tom you asked the question how does
mass increase as you go faster and this

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:12.969
mass increase as you go faster and this
 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:14.640
mass increase as you go faster and this
is really a wonderful part of Einstein's

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:14.650
is really a wonderful part of Einstein's
 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.550
is really a wonderful part of Einstein's
theories it actually is also relatively

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.560
theories it actually is also relatively
 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.920
theories it actually is also relatively
slippery and kind of complicated because

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:19.930
slippery and kind of complicated because
 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.590
slippery and kind of complicated because
to even answer this question at all we

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:22.600
to even answer this question at all we
 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.320
to even answer this question at all we
have to ask the rather strange question

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330
have to ask the rather strange question
 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.810
have to ask the rather strange question
what do you mean by mass what is your

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820
what do you mean by mass what is your
 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.509
what do you mean by mass what is your
definition of mass you may have heard

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:30.519
definition of mass you may have heard
 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.910
definition of mass you may have heard
that nothing with mass can possibly go

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920
that nothing with mass can possibly go
 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.740
that nothing with mass can possibly go
at the speed of light the only things

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750
at the speed of light the only things
 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.000
at the speed of light the only things
that travel at the speed of light are

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010
that travel at the speed of light are
 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.030
that travel at the speed of light are
photons pure energy light the speed of

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040
photons pure energy light the speed of
 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.670
photons pure energy light the speed of
light nothing with any mass at all can

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680
light nothing with any mass at all can
 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.470
light nothing with any mass at all can
travel at the speed of light because as

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480
travel at the speed of light because as
 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.690
travel at the speed of light because as
it gets closer and closer to the speed

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:45.700
it gets closer and closer to the speed
 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.869
it gets closer and closer to the speed
of light its mass increases and if it

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879
of light its mass increases and if it
 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:50.400
of light its mass increases and if it
were actually traveling at the speed of

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410
were actually traveling at the speed of
 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.619
were actually traveling at the speed of
light it would have an infinite mass so

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629
light it would have an infinite mass so
 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:54.209
light it would have an infinite mass so
think about that even if you had a tiny

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:54.219
think about that even if you had a tiny
 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:56.610
think about that even if you had a tiny
little particle that was say billions of

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620
little particle that was say billions of
 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.410
little particle that was say billions of
times less massive than an electron just

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420
times less massive than an electron just
 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.439
times less massive than an electron just
a tiny tiny little piece of mass if for

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449
a tiny tiny little piece of mass if for
 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:03.810
a tiny tiny little piece of mass if for
some reason that tiny thing accelerated

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820
some reason that tiny thing accelerated
 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.969
some reason that tiny thing accelerated
to the speed of light it would have an

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979
to the speed of light it would have an
 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.210
to the speed of light it would have an
infinite mass and that's a bit of a

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220
infinite mass and that's a bit of a
 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.910
infinite mass and that's a bit of a
problem so let's talk about this one of

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920
problem so let's talk about this one of
 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.050
problem so let's talk about this one of
the things that you really have to

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060
the things that you really have to
 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.880
the things that you really have to
realize is the speed of light is very

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890
realize is the speed of light is very
 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.580
realize is the speed of light is very
very special it's not just simply a

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590
very special it's not just simply a
 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.199
very special it's not just simply a
speed of something moving through space

00:01:19.199 --> 00:01:19.209
speed of something moving through space
 

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:22.199
speed of something moving through space
as you go faster and faster and closer

00:01:22.199 --> 00:01:22.209
as you go faster and faster and closer
 

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:24.870
as you go faster and faster and closer
to the speed of light time itself begins

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880
to the speed of light time itself begins
 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.960
to the speed of light time itself begins
to slow down and space begins to

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970
to slow down and space begins to
 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.449
to slow down and space begins to
contract as you go close to the speed of

00:01:30.449 --> 00:01:30.459
contract as you go close to the speed of
 

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:32.910
contract as you go close to the speed of
light the entire universe becomes

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920
light the entire universe becomes
 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.249
light the entire universe becomes
smaller and smaller until it basically

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259
smaller and smaller until it basically
 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:37.410
smaller and smaller until it basically
becomes a single point when you're going

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420
becomes a single point when you're going
 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.859
becomes a single point when you're going
at the speed of light and time as you go

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869
at the speed of light and time as you go
 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.870
at the speed of light and time as you go
closer to the speed of light get slower

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880
closer to the speed of light get slower
 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.570
closer to the speed of light get slower
and slower until basically time is a

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580
and slower until basically time is a
 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.660
and slower until basically time is a
single point at the speed of light light

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670
single point at the speed of light light
 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.650
single point at the speed of light light
does not experience space or time it's

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660
does not experience space or time it's
 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.630
does not experience space or time it's
not just a speed going through something

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640
not just a speed going through something
 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.660
not just a speed going through something
all of the universe shifts around this

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670
all of the universe shifts around this
 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.600
all of the universe shifts around this
constant the speed of light time and

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610
constant the speed of light time and
 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.949
constant the speed of light time and
space itself stop when you go that speed

00:02:03.949 --> 00:02:03.959
space itself stop when you go that speed
 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:07.109
space itself stop when you go that speed
so the reason you can't accelerate to

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119
so the reason you can't accelerate to
 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:08.430
so the reason you can't accelerate to
the speed of light and the reason we say

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440
the speed of light and the reason we say
 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.020
the speed of light and the reason we say
you have an infinite mass it's a little

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030
you have an infinite mass it's a little
 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.479
you have an infinite mass it's a little
complicated because the idea that mass

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489
complicated because the idea that mass
 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.910
complicated because the idea that mass
actually is a measurement of energy you

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920
actually is a measurement of energy you
 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.520
actually is a measurement of energy you
may remember Einstein's famous equation

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530
may remember Einstein's famous equation
 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.760
may remember Einstein's famous equation
equals MC

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770
equals MC
 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.790
equals MC
energy equals mass times the speed of

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800
energy equals mass times the speed of
 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.190
energy equals mass times the speed of
light squared energy and mass are

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200
light squared energy and mass are
 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.960
light squared energy and mass are
equivalent mass is basically a

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970
equivalent mass is basically a
 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.820
equivalent mass is basically a
measurement of how much energy there is

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830
measurement of how much energy there is
 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.760
measurement of how much energy there is
in an object when you're moving you have

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770
in an object when you're moving you have
 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.980
in an object when you're moving you have
the energy of your motion - that's

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990
the energy of your motion - that's
 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.280
the energy of your motion - that's
called kinetic energy energy of motion

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290
called kinetic energy energy of motion
 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.460
called kinetic energy energy of motion
so equals MC squared now your mass has

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470
so equals MC squared now your mass has
 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.830
so equals MC squared now your mass has
not just the stuff that's in you but

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840
not just the stuff that's in you but
 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.660
not just the stuff that's in you but
also the energy of your motion and

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670
also the energy of your motion and
 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.200
also the energy of your motion and
that's why mass seems to increase as you

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210
that's why mass seems to increase as you
 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.030
that's why mass seems to increase as you
go faster and faster and closer to the

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040
go faster and faster and closer to the
 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.340
go faster and faster and closer to the
speed of light it's not that you're

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350
speed of light it's not that you're
 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.110
speed of light it's not that you're
actually getting any heavier the

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120
actually getting any heavier the
 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.699
actually getting any heavier the
increase in mass is something that's

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709
increase in mass is something that's
 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.500
increase in mass is something that's
only observed by people that are

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510
only observed by people that are
 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.780
only observed by people that are
watching you go by if you're on a

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790
watching you go by if you're on a
 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.580
watching you go by if you're on a
spaceship going very fast to the speed

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590
spaceship going very fast to the speed
 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:01.990
spaceship going very fast to the speed
of light you don't notice anything

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000
of light you don't notice anything
 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.760
of light you don't notice anything
getting heavier you are on your

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770
getting heavier you are on your
 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.260
getting heavier you are on your
spaceship you can jump up and down you

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270
spaceship you can jump up and down you
 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:06.790
spaceship you can jump up and down you
can skip rope you can do whatever you

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800
can skip rope you can do whatever you
 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.500
can skip rope you can do whatever you
want you don't notice any change at all

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510
want you don't notice any change at all
 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.930
want you don't notice any change at all
but if people try to measure your mass

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940
but if people try to measure your mass
 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.690
but if people try to measure your mass
as you go by they not only are measuring

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700
as you go by they not only are measuring
 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.790
as you go by they not only are measuring
your rest mass you know we are masked

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800
your rest mass you know we are masked
 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.710
your rest mass you know we are masked
when you were still but this added

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720
when you were still but this added
 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.780
when you were still but this added
energy of this huge speed that you have

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790
energy of this huge speed that you have
 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.310
energy of this huge speed that you have
through space and that's called a

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320
through space and that's called a
 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.130
through space and that's called a
relativistic mass it's a complex idea to

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140
relativistic mass it's a complex idea to
 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.170
relativistic mass it's a complex idea to
think that mass itself is a measurement

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180
think that mass itself is a measurement
 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.120
think that mass itself is a measurement
of energy so that changes depending on

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130
of energy so that changes depending on
 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.920
of energy so that changes depending on
how fast you're going if you were to

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930
how fast you're going if you were to
 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.509
how fast you're going if you were to
slow down on your spaceship you would

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519
slow down on your spaceship you would
 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.580
slow down on your spaceship you would
not keep that mass you would go back to

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590
not keep that mass you would go back to
 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.350
not keep that mass you would go back to
being the same mass you were before you

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360
being the same mass you were before you
 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.140
being the same mass you were before you
started moving back quickly so as you

can see it's a complicated answer

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010
can see it's a complicated answer
 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.820
can see it's a complicated answer
depending on how you define mass because

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830
depending on how you define mass because
 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.350
depending on how you define mass because
as you're going very close to the speed

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360
as you're going very close to the speed
 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.360
as you're going very close to the speed
of light and you have a huge speed you

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370
of light and you have a huge speed you
 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.009
of light and you have a huge speed you
need to take into account that energy

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019
need to take into account that energy
 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:49.810
need to take into account that energy
because of the equation equals MC

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820
because of the equation equals MC
 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.490
because of the equation equals MC
