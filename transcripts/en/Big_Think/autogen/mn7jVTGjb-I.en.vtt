shows it's wrong okay so if you can't

00:01:34.559 --> 00:01:34.569
shows it's wrong okay so if you can't
 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:36.809
shows it's wrong okay so if you can't
falsify it you know what are you really

there what's the difference between an
 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.540
there what's the difference between an
invisible floating heatless dragon and

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550
invisible floating heatless dragon and
 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.920
invisible floating heatless dragon and
no dragon at all none and of course we

no dragon at all none and of course we
 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.050
no dragon at all none and of course we
can apply this to God or any other

if there's no way to test it that how
 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.960
if there's no way to test it that how
will we ever know it's true this is the

know if somebody has an agenda you know

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739
know if somebody has an agenda you know
 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.160
know if somebody has an agenda you know
so when you watch Fox News you know that

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170
so when you watch Fox News you know that
 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.920
so when you watch Fox News you know that
they have an agenda for sure or there's

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930
they have an agenda for sure or there's
 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.170

other sources on the left that have a
 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.430
other sources on the left that have a
liberal agenda maybe NPR who knows but

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440
liberal agenda maybe NPR who knows but
 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.930
liberal agenda maybe NPR who knows but
you see it's good to know that just in

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940
you see it's good to know that just in
 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.250
you see it's good to know that just in
case so when you hear the faggio well

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260
case so when you hear the faggio well
 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.680

maybe but I know this guy has an agenda

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690
maybe but I know this guy has an agenda
 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.920
maybe but I know this guy has an agenda
so you know that's the kind of thing

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930
so you know that's the kind of thing
 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.960
so you know that's the kind of thing

math I'll share the Nobel Prize with you

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140
math I'll share the Nobel Prize with you
 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.289
math I'll share the Nobel Prize with you
right I don't do math and physics so you

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299
right I don't do math and physics so you
 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:08.520
right I don't do math and physics so you
know you might take it to the local high

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530

most everything not everything so
 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:21.449
most everything not everything so
there's always anomalies we can't

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459
there's always anomalies we can't
 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.100
there's always anomalies we can't
explain so maybe there's new some new

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110
explain so maybe there's new some new
 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.510

theory coming down the pike that might

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520
theory coming down the pike that might
 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.540
theory coming down the pike that might
account for all the old theories

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550
account for all the old theories
 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.130
account for all the old theories
explanations and the new anomalies the

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140
explanations and the new anomalies the
 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.670
explanations and the new anomalies the
anomalies that

the old theory can't explain baby but
 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.290
the old theory can't explain baby but
again we got to be able to test it first

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300
again we got to be able to test it first
 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.790
again we got to be able to test it first
and so those are the kinds of things

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800
and so those are the kinds of things
 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.409

you're in for example again these

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289
you're in for example again these
 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:45.870
you're in for example again these
alternative physics guys come to me

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880
alternative physics guys come to me
 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.570
alternative physics guys come to me
don't come to me I'm not a physicist did

you at least ask the local high school

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350
you at least ask the local high school
 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:51.749

don't know all the mistakes that people

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690
don't know all the mistakes that people
 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.330
don't know all the mistakes that people
in the past have already made to get to

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340
in the past have already made to get to
 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.950
in the past have already made to get to
where they are now and if you're

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960
where they are now and if you're
 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.719
