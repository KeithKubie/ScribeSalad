00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.600
HERALDO MUNOZ: Thank you
very much and pleased

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.820
to be back at Google
to talk about this book

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.480
that I wrote as a consequence
of having presided

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.940
the Commission of Inquiry
of the United Nations

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.340
into the Assassination
of Benazir Bhutto.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.550
I was, at the time that I
was designated president

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.660
of this Commission
of Inquiry-- this

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.060
was in early 2009--
I was ambassador

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.110
of my country of Chile
to the United Nations.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.830
And I got a phone call
while I was vacationing

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.960
in the south of Chile,
in the Patagonia,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.540
from the Chief of Staff of the
Secretary General, Ban Ki Moon,

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.080
asking me whether I would
preside this commission that

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.400
was going to be
instituted to investigate

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.920
the assassination
of Benazir Bhutto.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.670
Benazir Bhutto had
been assassinated

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.489
at a park in the
city of Rawalpindi,

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:12.110
right outside Islamabad, the
capital, in December of 2007.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.840
I was very surprised
about this call

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.510
because I was a
sitting ambassador.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.330
And, generally, individuals that
preside commissions of inquiry

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.240
are former prime ministers,
former foreign ministers,

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.300
or even former ambassadors.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.610
But I was an
ambassador in office.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.530
So I called my president,
President Michelle Bachelet,

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.260
thinking that she might say,
look this is a bit delicate.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.290
Better say, no.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.820
And, to my surprise, she said,
no, this is an honor for Chile

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.810
because Chile is
seen as trustworthy.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.990
And it's a personal recognition
of your role at the UN,

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.530
so accept.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.870
So I had no choice but to relay
that, yes, I would accept.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.420
I had asked for 24 hours.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.060
And I was told that
my mission would

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.340
be one of establishing the
facts and circumstances

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.110
of the assassination.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.640
My commission would
not be a tribunal

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.070
that would establish whether
someone was guilty or not

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.510
in the assassination.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.700
Which made it very complicated
because I thought--

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.070
I began to think that it would
be a lose-lose situation.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.230
Because I could not
subpoena anyone,

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.950
anybody that would
be interrogated

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.650
would be voluntary.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:44.310
And, in the end, I would not be
able to assign responsibility

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.110
for the assassination.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.790
I would only be able to refer to
the facts and the circumstances

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.150
of the assassination.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.130
And on the other hand, I thought
the Pakistani public and world

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.500
public opinion might expect
a lot from this commission.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.280
They might expect that we would
come out with a smoking gun

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.160
and identifying who did it.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.930
But nevertheless, I thought
I had to take it up.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.800
I never knew exactly
why I was chosen.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.830
Perhaps because I had
presided the al-Qaeda

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.780
and Taliban sanctions committee
while my country was member

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:29.000
of the Security Council
of the UN in 2003, 2004.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.640
So I took it up
and then, later on,

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.480
the Secretary General
assigned two commissioners

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.670
to work with me.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.080
A former Attorney
General of Indonesia

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:51.070
and a former deputy
police chief of Ireland.

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.100
Aside from a sizable
staff that helped us.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:01.720
This was perhaps the
most challenging endeavor

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.590
I've been involved in.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.050
I've been in politics
for quite a while.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.880
I was in the resistance to
the dictatorship in my country

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.470
as a young man.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.370
I spent time underground.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.230
Then later on, I was a
member of the NO Committee

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.959
that defeated Pinochet,
the pleboscite.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.709
There's a movie called "NO."

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:21.959
Some of you may have heard it.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.430
I was a member of that
executive committee.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.560
And then I had a lot of posts
as ambassador to the US,

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:37.220
in Washington, to Brazil,
and ambassador to the UN,

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.742
aside from being minister.

00:04:38.742 --> 00:04:40.450
My country was minister
Secretary General

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:41.200
of the government.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.830
I was deputy foreign minister.

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.440
So I had a lot of
experience but never

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.490
had I been put before
such a challenge.

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:56.790
And, sure enough, as soon
as we arrived in Pakistan

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.020
to begin our work-- we went
to a lot of preparation,

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:06.305
of course-- a lot of
surprises began to occur.

00:05:06.305 --> 00:05:08.810
I had some warnings.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.300
There was a Pakistani writer
that wrote a beautiful piece

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.630
in the "New York Times"
saying, basically,

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.340
that Pakistan is a land
of conspiracy theories.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.240
And that is really complicated
because everybody's distrustful

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.770
and make up their own
stories about what

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.440
may happen to public
situations and incidents,

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.440
particularly regarding violence.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:44.980
For example, he said when the
Sri Lanka cricket national team

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.360
was attacked in Lahore,
this writer, you know--

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.860
he says it in the
"New York Times"--

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.800
he went talking to people in
the streets of Lahore, asking,

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.510
so who do you think did it?

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.270
And people gather around him
and some said, criminals.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.900
Other ones said, no,
terrorists, the Taliban.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.020
And others said, the government.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.050
And others said, no, the
intelligence agencies.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.310
And somebody else said, India.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:17.940
So conspiracy theories are very
easily encountered in Pakistan.

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.340
And so that wasn't very easy.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.440
In addition to that,
Pakistan is a society

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.370
that has lived half of
it's independent life

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.340
under military rule.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:37.260
So that democracy, evidently,
has been very challenged

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.740
throughout history.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.950
And at the time, there was a
dictatorship, a dictatorship

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:46.600
of Pervez Musharraf,
General Musharraf.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:53.160
And precisely Benazir Bhutto was
intent on returning to Pakistan

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.490
from her self-exile to
confront the dictator

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.860
and to try to recuperate
democracy for Pakistanis.

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.380
And that was the context
of her assassination.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:09.190
She was returning to
Pakistan after being

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:14.380
out for quite a while, mainly
living in Dubai and London.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:20.630
And her idea was to
rein in the military,

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:24.110
to make sure that the
intelligence services would

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:27.800
be under the oversight
of civilian rule,

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.260
and to make sure that the
country would begin going down

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.290
the road of development
and democracy.

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:40.400
And she was very keen on
repairing relations with India,

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.740
as well that has
always been the rival

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.700
in the mindset of Pakistan.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:53.370
That was the context
of her return.

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:58.750
And the return had been
a return facilitated

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:03.130
by the United States and the UK.

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:05.720
The United States began
to see, even though they

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:11.620
backed Musharraf, very strongly
because Musharraf assured then

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.860
to the Bush administration--
the Bush-Cheney administration--

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:22.890
that the extremists would be
pursued by the government.

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:26.350
But the government had a lot
of dealings with the Taliban,

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:28.420
had a lot of dealings
with extremists.

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.180
For quite a while, in fact.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.120
This wasn't new.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.039
And they were playing
a double game.

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:37.280
Collaborating with the US,
particularly after 9/11,

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:42.730
capturing some al-Qaeda
types, and even some Talibans.

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:44.460
But on the other
hand, continuing

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:49.440
to have contacts with
them, and, in fact, to

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.060
have strong contacts with them.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:56.290
Because in the mindset of
the Musharraf government,

00:08:56.290 --> 00:09:02.700
they needed to have strategic
depth into Afghanistan.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:07.230
And that dictated
the need to have

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:11.480
this relationship with
the Pakistani Taliban.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.690
Being Pashtuns,
most of them, were

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:20.760
in common with most of the
Taliban in Afghanistan.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.950
So that was the context.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:27.890
And as Musharraf
began to be a problem,

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:32.650
the US began to see
that, increasingly, he

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:34.970
was not to be fully trusted.

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:38.330
They began to see that the
best formula for Pakistan

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:41.450
would be to have
Musharraf because he

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:44.320
was the man of the
Army that would ensure

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:48.220
the fight against terror, and
to have Benazir Bhutto that

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:49.990
would be the reinstatement
of democracy.

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:52.430
That was the best
of the two worlds.

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:56.630
And the idea was even, OK,
so why didn't Musharraf

00:09:56.630 --> 00:10:01.000
remain as president so long
as he took off his uniform.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.870
And Benazir Bhutto
as prime minister.

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:06.930
Benazir Bhutto had been
prime minister twice before.

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:08.760
She had never finished her term.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.730
She had been dismissed
from office both times,

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:16.420
in '88 and then in '93
[INAUDIBLE] she served.

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:20.850
So that this was
a great challenge.

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:25.110
This was the context in which
the assassination takes place.

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:29.360
She goes back, in
October of 2007--

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:33.860
back, as I said, with the
idea that there's a deal.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:37.650
She begins to have conversations
with Musharraf in Dubai

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:39.310
to have a deal.

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:43.270
So that she's
allowed to come back

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:46.350
without any trials
against her, particularly

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:48.140
for corruption cases.

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:51.750
Which was always a reason
why any prime minister

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.730
was dismissed in Pakistan.

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:57.410
And, on the other
hand, Musharraf

00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:59.300
would take off his uniform.

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:03.410
And that would be then a deal.

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:07.650
But, of course, she was
contesting for elections.

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:11.340
And Musharraf was of the idea
that she should come back

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:12.990
after the elections.

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:21.840
In other words, in January of
2008 or around New Year's, New

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.020
Year's Eve or New Year's.

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:28.230
But Benazir Bhutto realizes she
had to campaign for her party,

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:31.980
the PPP, the Pakistani
People's Party.

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:34.110
So she decided to
come back in October.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:37.150
And Musharraf felt that
the deal had been broken.

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:40.760
And he was irate
about her return.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:45.810
When she returns on
the 18th of October.

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:49.430
And she's received by
practically half a million

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:51.950
people in Karachi, maybe more.

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:53.070
The estimates vary.

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:54.710
But huge crowds.

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:56.110
Huge crowds.

00:11:56.110 --> 00:12:01.430
And she's in a truck
driving from the airport

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:05.810
to the mausoleum of the founder
of Pakistan, Ali Jinnah.

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:09.200
And as she goes very
slowly because there's

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.960
thousands upon thousands
of people in the road,

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.200
there's an explosion.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.540
And an attack against her.

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:21.380
140 people die.

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:24.240
That was the way that
she was received.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.290
On the one hand, with
the love of the people.

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:29.870
But on the other hand,
with a terrorist attack

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:34.590
that took the lives of
so many of her partisans.

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:39.250
So when we went, this was
what we wanted to unravel.

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:42.730
But she had actually been
killed not in Karachi.

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:44.340
She had escaped that.

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:51.070
And she had been killed in
a place in Rawalpindi, which

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:57.260
is relatively near Islamabad,
the capital of Pakistan.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:02.410
In a park called Liaquat Bagh.

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:06.330
She had been assassinated,
immediately after a rally,

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:11.740
as she was departing the rally,
by a man who had shot at her

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:15.450
and, with a suicide vest,
had blown himself up,

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:23.460
killing 38 people and Benzir
Bhutto at the same time.

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:26.900
Interestingly, the place
where she was killed

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:32.400
was the same place, the park,
where the first prime minister

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:36.250
of Pakistan, the one who had
succeeded the founder, Ali

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:39.450
Jinnah, who had died
of natural causes.

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:41.890
He had been very sick.

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:44.600
And a very untimely
death because Pakistan

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.760
had become independent after
the partition with India.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:53.120
And Ali Jinnah was the man to
unify the country and he died.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:57.950
And his successor,
Liaquat Ali Khan,

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:00.700
was assassinated,
at the same park,

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:05.890
in the same place where, 56
years later, Benazir Bhutto

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:07.830
would be assassinated.

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:12.380
And he was assassinated at a
public rally, political rally,

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:17.950
by a gunman that shot him and
was captured by the crowd.

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:21.090
But nevertheless a
sub-inspector of the police

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:25.780
comes and shoots the
assailant six times.

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:32.170
So we never know who was
behind-- was he a lone wolf?

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:35.640
That attacked that
prime minister,

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:37.670
Ali Khan, Liaquat Ali Khan?

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:39.130
Were there other people behind?

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:41.890
Up to today, there
are controversies

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:44.750
about who was behind
that assassination.

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:48.700
So you can imagine--
this is the background

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:50.530
of the assassination
of Benazir Bhutto.

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:52.370
At this exact place.

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:56.350
Doing the book, I found
some unbelievable stories.

00:14:56.350 --> 00:15:00.410
It so happens that when
prime minister Liaquat Ali

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:02.350
Khan is assassinated
in 1951, he's

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:04.890
taken to the military
hospital nearby.

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:09.170
And there's a doctor
by the name of Khan

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:13.330
that tries to revive him, fails.

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:15.490
When Benazir Bhutto
is attacked, she's

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:20.980
taken to a Rawalpindi hospital
nearby, a different hospital.

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:24.000
And the doctor in charge
is called Mossadegh Khan.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.780
It so happens that Mossadegh
Khan is the son of the Dr. Khan

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:35.570
that had tried unsuccessfully
to revive prime minister Ali

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:36.930
Khan in 1951.

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:39.990
The ironies of history
are unbelievable.

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:42.460
Well, but going back
to the investigation,

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:44.330
I want to say just
a few more things

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:48.990
so that you have a chance
to ask me questions.

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:53.070
I found myself in
a world that was

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:55.860
very different from
what I'm familiar with.

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:57.810
I know Latin America very well.

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:05.370
And the clues are different
because the clues of politics

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:09.160
in Pakistan are mixed with
the provincial elements,

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.550
with the religious elements,
with the neighboring

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:16.090
conditioning, with the
influence of outside actors

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:19.250
like the United States
and the UK in the past.

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:20.890
Quite different.

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:23.960
And this, as I said,
conspiracy theory

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:28.880
and this constant leaking
of information, which I

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.460
was very upset about.

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:33.400
In fact, the day we were
going to go to Pakistan

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:37.440
the first time, I'm informed
that my communications

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.120
have been hacked.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:44.420
So that we are very vulnerable.

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:49.850
So I tell the people at
the security at the UN.

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:52.760
And they said, well,
perhaps you shouldn't go.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.390
And I said, no, I have to go.

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:57.312
And this was hours before
I had to take the plane.

00:16:57.312 --> 00:16:58.770
And they said,
well, let's continue

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:02.210
talking while you stop in Dubai.

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:05.540
Because we were
stopped over before we

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:10.329
had to go to Islamabad.

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:13.069
And when I arrive
there, the communicator

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:14.869
said, well, we've been
thinking about it.

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:16.560
If you decide to go, you can go.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.609
But stay within
the red zone, which

00:17:18.609 --> 00:17:21.700
is the security zone
within Islamabad.

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.770
And I said, well, I
thank your suggestion.

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:25.700
But I can't because
the first thing I

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:28.010
have to do is to go
to Rawalpindi, to go

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:29.680
see the site of
the assassination.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.870
That's symbolically very
important to the people

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:35.320
of Pakistan and important to me.

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:38.190
So what I decided was
that we would arrive there

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:41.420
and we would go to Rawalpindi.

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:44.440
But there were a lot
of press following us.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:48.500
And possibly people that
might want to harm us.

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.390
And the first surprise
that I had was-- we

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:52.900
were in the security house.

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:54.590
Because we couldn't
stay at any hotel.

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:57.070
We couldn't stay at any
place of public access,

00:17:57.070 --> 00:18:00.700
because of the dangers
that that would entail.

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:05.830
And the first surprise
is that the cook, who

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:09.280
spoke only Urdu, did not
speak a word of English,

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:12.680
had my detailed agenda.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:16.610
And I said, how could the cook
have all this information?

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:18.320
And somebody gave
me an explanation

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.750
that was between
logical and absurd,

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:24.970
saying, well, he has to have
it, because he has to know when

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:27.280
you're going to be
here to prepare meals.

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:31.920
So I had to change everything.

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:36.970
And we decided to
play a ruse on anybody

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:39.990
that would want to harm
us and on the press that

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:41.950
followed as everywhere.

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:45.290
And we decided to say in
the program-- we actually

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:48.100
wrote in the program that
we would leave by helicopter

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:51.720
in the afternoon on the second
day that we had arrived.

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:56.970
Instead, we went the second
day at 5:00 AM, by cars.

00:18:56.970 --> 00:19:01.030
And it was everything
very good until we

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:03.290
arrived to the Liaquat Bagh.

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:07.620
And the police put
barricades about two blocks

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:10.510
away so that we were in
an area absolutely free

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:14.890
of any vehicles,
any people, nothing.

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:19.580
But I saw, in the distance,
some people after the barricades

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:21.590
that they had put up there.

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:26.410
So the commissioner from
Ireland, the policeman,

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:29.730
told me, you know what
it is, you're looking at?

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:32.260
Those are journalists.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:38.120
And, sure enough, their were
cameramen and photographers

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:43.370
with tele-lenses who
knew that we were there.

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:47.120
So the leaking of
information was unbelievable.

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:50.270
We confronted many
of these challenges

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:52.170
in the investigation.

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:54.840
A government that was very
supportive at the beginning.

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:59.370
Because it was presided by
the widower of Benazir Bhutto,

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:03.990
by President
Zardari, began to be,

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:07.540
very warm and supportive as
they were, at the beginning,

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:11.120
but then, as we began to be very
serious in the investigation,

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.860
we didn't feel as welcome
as at the beginning.

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:16.410
And we had a lot of
difficulties, particularly

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:18.246
with several
individuals, including

00:20:18.246 --> 00:20:19.620
the Minister of
the Interior, who

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:22.800
was appointment for
contact with us,

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:27.900
Rehman Malik, who
had been the security

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.460
person for Benazir Bhutto.

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:33.560
And, at the time of
the assassination,

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:37.475
he had been in the
backup bulletproof car.

00:20:37.475 --> 00:20:41.540
A backup car that obviously
had to be very near

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:44.460
the main car in which
Benazir Bhutto rode.

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:46.920
And it so happened
that it disappeared

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:48.920
at the moment of the attack.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.700
We never saw it in
any of the videos.

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:52.760
We never saw it in
any of the pictures.

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:56.390
And as I interrogated the
Minister of the Interior,

00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:59.200
constantly he avoided
answering my questions.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:02.260
And say, well, we'll
talk about it next time.

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:05.520
And that always was the case.

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:08.160
We found out, because
of the other occupants

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:14.060
in the backup car, that they
were between 150 and 250 yards

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:14.950
away.

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:18.310
They had departed before
the convoy had left.

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:22.700
And the rule in a convoy is
that everybody goes together.

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:25.800
And they had left
slightly before.

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:27.640
And, in fact, they
heard the bomb,

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:30.870
because that's what
they testified to us.

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:33.190
But, nevertheless,
they went away

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:36.780
to Zardari House, the house of
Benazir Bhutto in Islamabad.

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:40.760
That is about 25,
30 minutes away.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:44.700
So the car that was there
to be the backup leaves.

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:48.070
They don't even ask what has
happened to Benazir Bhutto.

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:52.620
They just leave, probably
to save their skin.

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:55.960
It so happens that the
car of Benazir Bhutto that

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:59.300
was a very good car,
a bulletproof car.

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:03.750
Because of the explosion
had blown the tires.

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:05.870
So when they try to
get to the hospital,

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:09.370
they are riding on the
rims of the wheels.

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:10.770
And they don't make it.

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:12.110
They make it halfway.

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:14.400
She has to be transported
by a private car.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:18.720
One of the militants-- one of
the activists of the party,

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.970
the PPP to make it there.

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:22.400
She has to be transferred.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.090
Of course, she dies.

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:25.210
She dies.

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:27.040
Maybe she would have
been saved if she

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.490
had been taken immediately.

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:29.640
Difficult to say.

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:33.240
No autopsy was made, because
the police impeded it.

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:37.400
And the police, one hour
and a half after the attack,

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:43.780
washes the place of the attack
with hoses-- with fire hoses.

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:45.910
So that all the
evidence that should

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:50.310
have been collected in a site
protected was eliminated.

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:52.660
We were with Scotland
Yard in London.

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:57.060
And Scotland Yard told us that,
in an attack of that nature,

00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:59.100
thousands and thousands
of pieces of evidence

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:00.370
would have been collected.

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:04.040
Only 23 pieces were collected.

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:10.370
So the assassination
was full of issues.

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:12.720
She was not
adequately protected.

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:16.310
Musharraf was very mad at her.

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:20.180
We found a letter that
the Musharraf government

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:23.940
had sent to provincial
authorities instructing

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:29.450
to provide VIP protection to
two former Prime ministers

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:32.490
but not to Benazir, not to her.

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:35.900
Specifically, she was excluded.

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:39.390
And the responsibility
to protect a former Prime

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:42.420
Minister was that of the
state, was that of Musharraf.

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:44.520
She was not
adequately protected.

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:48.590
But, in addition to that, there
was a cover up by the police.

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:50.980
And the police did not
act alone, in my view.

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:53.950
They had orders from above.

00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:59.835
But, evidently, also she
was hated by the Taliban

00:23:59.835 --> 00:24:05.740
because she was a woman
ruling an Islamist state.

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:07.610
Because she was a modern woman.

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:16.240
She had been raised in
the culture of the West.

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:19.160
She had been going to a
Catholic school in Pakistan.

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:22.560
Then she studied at
Harvard and then at Oxford.

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:26.200
She spoke better English
than Urdu, in fact.

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:29.530
She becomes involved in politics
once her father, Zulfikar Ali

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:33.220
Bhutto is killed,
is assassinated,

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:41.380
by the dictator in the 1980s--
late '70s and '80s, Zia-ul-Haq.

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:45.980
Who trumps up a case
to have him hanged.

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:49.970
Then she goes into politics.

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:54.030
So she was seen as a Western
woman, close to the West,

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:55.730
close to the United States.

00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:59.510
In addition to that, somebody
who would fight for democracy,

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:02.250
that would come down
strongly on extremists.

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:07.300
So the Pakistani Taliban
clearly hated her.

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:09.310
So did al-Qaeda.

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:12.350
But there were many others
that wanted her out.

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:13.910
And she distrusted,
particularly,

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:16.130
the people around Musharraf.

00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:17.590
She had sent a
letter to Musharraf

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:21.660
saying that she feared
the people around him,

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:25.080
specifically people linked
to the intelligence agencies,

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:27.670
to the ISI.

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:32.400
Hamid Gul was one of them,
a former ISI director.

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:36.300
Another one was
Ijaz Shah, who was

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:41.170
the head of another
intelligence bureau.

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:43.060
And a couple of
other individuals

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:47.370
who she felt very threatened by.

00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:52.860
So that was the story
that I put up in the book.

00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:56.610
I felt that I needed to get
it out beyond the report

00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:58.800
that we presented.

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.130
Tell the stories behind it.

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:05.690
Last thing to close, when
we finished the report,

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:08.420
we presented it to the Secretary
General it had a lot of impact

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:12.190
in the media, in
Pakistan, internationally.

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:18.470
And I was with my wife on the
subway on Lexington and 59th.

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:21.460
And there was an individual
walking back and forth

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:24.050
on the platform, as if
waiting for the train.

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:25.800
And he looked at
me and I thought

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.550
it might have been
a Chilean because I

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:29.270
used to be an authority.

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:31.517
That was my country.

00:26:31.517 --> 00:26:33.850
And sometimes when there are
tourists, Chilean tourists,

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:38.090
in town, I have been
recognized by some of them.

00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:41.705
But this guy didn't
look like a tourist.

00:26:41.705 --> 00:26:45.430
And he comes up, walks,
looks at me, and he asks me,

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:47.280
are you Ambassador
Munoz of Chile?

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:49.480
And I said, yes, I am.

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.330
Oh, he says, I'm Pakistani.

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:55.900
He says, you are the most
wanted person in Pakistan.

00:26:55.900 --> 00:27:00.850
And I said, most wanted in a
positive or negative sense?

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:03.020
I say that very
nervously to him.

00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:04.675
And he says, no, positively.

00:27:04.675 --> 00:27:08.710
He said, I've see
you in television.

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:09.980
I've seen you in the press.

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:11.370
Your picture's all around.

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:13.230
I've seen the
interviews that you

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:15.620
gave when you
presented your report.

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:17.850
You did a great job.

00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:22.150
I mean they all contributed very
strongly to clear up things.

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:25.360
But, he said, your
war will be lost.

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:27.000
Nothing will happen.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:33.090
Because impunity is the
rule of thumb in Pakistan.

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:36.750
So the courts won't do anything.

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:38.290
And this will be forgotten.

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:41.120
Because that's the way-- he
began to be very passionate.

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.210
And I moved away and I
said, thank you very much.

00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:45.920
And, my train is coming.

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.500
So that to close it
is to say that this

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:52.630
was a very important
investigation.

00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:54.990
And it was important to me.

00:27:54.990 --> 00:28:00.650
And it opened up the
court case in Pakistan.

00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:04.200
An anti-terrorist
court opened it up.

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:07.560
And, in fact, today
the case is open.

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:10.692
And Musharraf has been indicted.

00:28:10.692 --> 00:28:12.150
Even though he has
been released on

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:14.840
bail in the case
of Benazir Bhutto.

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.080
Final thing, for
me was important,

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.910
because I met her
in the early '90s,

00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:23.840
when I was in Washington
serving my government.

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:28.560
And I went to US Congress
seminar on transition

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:29.270
to democracy.

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:31.360
She spoke about Pakistan.

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:32.360
I spoke about Chile.

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:37.000
And when we sat together, she
says to me, sort of whispering,

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.920
saying, you know, oh,
I'm so glad to know you

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:41.740
because I love Chile.

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:46.680
My father and I we
are so sorry, so sad,

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:50.940
when president Salvador
Allende was assassinated

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:53.340
in the coup d'etat in Chile.

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:55.450
Now we know that the
Americans were behind it.

00:28:55.450 --> 00:28:57.490
That they supported
the right in Chile

00:28:57.490 --> 00:29:00.970
and they pushed that
military coup because Allende

00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:01.770
was a socialist.

00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:05.460
That he wanted changes, like
my father wanted changes.

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:07.140
So I said, well,
thank you very much.

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:09.110
And I said, I felt very
close to your father.

00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:12.230
Because when I was
a graduate student,

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:15.670
my best friend in graduate
school was a Pakistani

00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:19.170
and we exchanged
notes about the--

00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:22.570
at that time, the
detention-- and the overthrow

00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:27.480
of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto by
the dictator, Zia-ul-Haq.

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:31.260
So I felt, as I said, close
to the reality of Pakistan

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:32.432
at that time.

00:29:32.432 --> 00:29:34.140
And then later on, of
course, your father

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:37.170
was killed by the dictatorship.

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:39.930
So I want to thank
you and tell you that.

00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:45.330
And so she gave me a
smile and shook my hand.

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:48.450
I never had anymore
conversation with her.

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:51.050
The irony would be that
20 some years later,

00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:53.150
I would be investigating
her assassination.

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:57.090
So that's what is in the
book and many other things.

00:29:57.090 --> 00:30:00.912
But thank you very much
and let me hear from you.

00:30:00.912 --> 00:30:02.620
Questions and comments
that you may have.

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:03.160
Thanks.

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:08.740
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:11.630
AUDIENCE: The story you tell--
I mean, listening to it.

00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:13.630
It seems like a
story where there

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:18.680
is incompetence being
used to mask malice.

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:21.360
Like what you described with
what happened with the police

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:24.940
investigation, hosing
down the evidence.

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:27.710
When you were there,
conducting the investigation,

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:29.800
did you feel that a lot?

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:35.100
HERALDO MUNOZ: Yeah, I felt
that there was incompetence,

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:35.715
for sure.

00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:41.150
But I think there was
more than competence.

00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:47.430
I mean, I thought it was
acts of malice in fact.

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:50.150
That there was something
there that just didn't fit.

00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:59.460
The decision to wash
the site, for example,

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:02.470
had not been taken
before in other cases.

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:08.270
Except, the military had done
that in some cases involving

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:12.246
attacks against high
military authorities.

00:31:12.246 --> 00:31:13.620
But the police
knew that they had

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:17.540
to cordon off and
save the evidence.

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:23.150
And we heard that there
were phone calls that

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:28.300
were made from
intelligence agencies.

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:30.590
That might have
had an explanation.

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:34.500
The other side of it is that
the policeman may have thought

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:37.430
that an assassination of
such an important person

00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:40.960
had to have higher-ups
involved and they themselves

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:47.890
decided to wash up, because they
better safeguard themselves.

00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:50.810
That could have been
the other explanation.

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:56.700
But it wasn't something
that was casual,

00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:59.480
that just simply happened.

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:01.800
That was a political
decision to do that.

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:05.810
Then the decision not
to perform the autopsy

00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:07.320
on Benazir Bhutto
in the hospital.

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:08.880
That was a decision
of the police.

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:10.670
The police was
responsible for that,

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:13.110
according to the
law in Pakistan.

00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:17.370
Nevertheless, the policeman,
the head of their local police,

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:21.860
impeded the doctor from
performing the autopsy.

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:27.010
So that was something else that,
to me, says that he got a phone

00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:31.180
call from the deputy of ISI.

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:34.320
And they deny that to us
and then they recognized it.

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:38.190
After we showed that we have
evidence about that phone call.

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:40.260
Then they say, oh,
yes, we did call.

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:43.120
But we called just to know
whether she had fully--

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:44.840
that it was fully
clear that she had

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:49.230
died so that to relay that
information to our superiors.

00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:52.970
So these things,
my feeling, just

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:58.480
don't happen by--
as something that

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:01.830
doesn't have a political
motivation behind.

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:08.700
And Musharraf he was irate
about her having come back

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:16.860
sort of undoing the deal
that they had tried to reach.

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:20.260
And not providing the
security was so important

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:22.284
that there was a
conversation that now we

00:33:22.284 --> 00:33:24.700
have a lot of sources backing
up the conversation in which

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:27.380
Musharraf tells Benazir Bhutto.

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:29.032
When Benazir Bhutto
tells him, look,

00:33:29.032 --> 00:33:30.490
the Americans are
going to call you

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:32.020
so that you provide security.

00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:33.865
And Musharraf says
something like, look,

00:33:33.865 --> 00:33:37.080
the Americans can
call all they want.

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:41.540
But your security depends on
the relationship between you

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:46.920
and I. Your security depends on
the status of our relationship.

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:52.710
That tells you-- tells
you a lot, I think.

00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:53.710
Yes?

00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:54.680
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:54.680 --> 00:34:00.970
I wondered if there were
any groups claiming credit

00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:04.830
for doing this that you
thought was a reputable claim.

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:09.580
And if no one really
did try to claim credit

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:11.537
for it, why do
you think that is?

00:34:11.537 --> 00:34:12.370
HERALDO MUNOZ: Yeah.

00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:20.100
al-Qaeda claimed credit.

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:24.540
Through a spokesperson,
a high member,

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:28.320
they called a
newspaper, "Asia Times,"

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:30.980
to claim responsibility.

00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:34.710
And, in addition to that, the
Musharraf government-- but this

00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:37.320
was something of a boomerang.

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:40.449
Less than 24 hours
after the assassination,

00:34:40.449 --> 00:34:43.389
a spokesperson from the
Ministry of the Interior

00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:46.610
comes up and on
television and says,

00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:49.520
this has been committed
by Baitullah Mehsud

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:52.570
head of the Pakistani
Taliban, of the TTP,

00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:56.260
one of the major groups,
of the Pakistani Taliban.

00:34:56.260 --> 00:35:00.350
And the cause of
death was Benazir

00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:05.220
hitting her head on the lever
of the sun roof of the vehicle.

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:11.080
How do you-- the question that
experts and public opinion

00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:16.170
posed was, how do you know who
did it and the cause of death

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:18.540
24 hours after it has happened?

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:21.740
There has been no
investigation, nothing.

00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:25.500
And the Ministry of
the Interior claimed

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:27.970
that, because of
ISI information,

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:31.900
they had a recording of a
conversation between Baitullah

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:36.070
Mehsud and some other individual
where he congratulated

00:35:36.070 --> 00:35:39.220
these people for having
performed a great deed,

00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:42.830
by having-- they didn't
say, mentioning, you know,

00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:44.230
by killing Benazir Bhutto.

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:47.070
They just, sort of,
indirectly suggested

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:49.490
that they were
being congratulated

00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:52.870
because of this
terrorist operation.

00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:57.960
When asked about this
Mr. Baitullah Mehsud, who

00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:04.750
was, by the way, a
target of the US.

00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:08.110
And finally, was taken out
in a drone attack in 2009,

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:09.860
by the way.

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:13.310
He react the same,
I didn't do it.

00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:15.090
I don't attack women.

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:19.474
That's against Islamic
tribal traditions.

00:36:19.474 --> 00:36:21.640
But, on the other hand,
there were a lot of evidence

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:24.900
that he felt that
Benazir Bhutto was

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:26.980
anathema to what he stood for.

00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:33.120
Benazir wanted an inclusive
society, a democratic society.

00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:36.400
She wanted to come
down on the extremists.

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.600
She wanted to control the
intelligence agencies.

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:40.310
So everything that
she stood for.

00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:46.230
In addition to that, she
was considered a Shia

00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:49.890
by these groups, Sunnis.

00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:52.060
Because her mother was Iranian.

00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:55.320
Benazir Bhutto's
mother was a Shia.

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:59.020
So that was an element too.

00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:00.960
So it is very
difficult to conceive

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:06.880
that Baitullah Mehsud wasn't
involved, despite the denial.

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:11.110
So that, in the
end, I try to think

00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:13.630
a lot about the big question.

00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:16.170
So who did it?

00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:18.460
The only thing that
comes out to me

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:22.450
is a Spanish play, a
17th century Spanish play

00:37:22.450 --> 00:37:24.710
called "Fuenteovejuna."

00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:27.540
Fuenteovejuna is a village.

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:31.080
And the story goes
that this village

00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:33.070
was ruled by an
individual that was

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:34.880
quite heated by the population.

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:38.810
And one day this
individual is assassinated.

00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:42.810
And a judge arrives
in town to investigate

00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:49.830
who's the murderer, who
assassinated this man.

00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:52.540
And he begins to
interrogate every villager

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:54.270
of Fuenteovejuna.

00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:57.720
And every villager says,
Fuenteovejuna did it.

00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:59.050
The village did it.

00:37:59.050 --> 00:38:00.930
And they go one by one.

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:03.900
And the judge doesn't find
anybody except everybody

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:05.535
saying the village did it.

00:38:05.535 --> 00:38:06.410
Fuenteovejuna did it.

00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:10.010
He even tortures some
individuals and they all say,

00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:11.650
Fuenteovejuna did it.

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:15.080
And as a sort of
parallel, as a metaphor,

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:17.420
I thought, well, Benazir
Bhutto, in a sense,

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:20.550
was killed by Fuenteovejuna,
was killed by the village.

00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:24.000
Because al-Qaeda
wanted her dead.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:29.380
The Pakistani Taliban executed
it through an individual.

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:34.970
The actual murder,
the suicide murderer,

00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:38.520
was a
15-and-a-half-year-old kid.

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:41.170
Less than 16 years old.

00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:43.510
We were with Scotland
Yard and they

00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:46.480
were able to determine
the exact age.

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:50.290
A 16-year-old doesn't
do it on his own.

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:54.780
So, in fact, we saw
a piece of a hand

00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:56.870
because that was
one of the remains.

00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:59.130
And there were
these drawings that

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:02.420
were tradition in Pakistan
are the drawings that you

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:04.620
have for a wedding.

00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:08.860
Because of the idea that he
was going to a better place.

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:16.375
And he was going to have the big
weddings with many, many girls

00:39:16.375 --> 00:39:19.090
that wait for him.

00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:22.040
So he was manipulated
into doing this.

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:23.760
Who was behind?

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:26.590
But clearly, the Pakistani
Taliban were involved.

00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:28.660
The police, local
police, was involved

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:30.820
because they tried a cover up.

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:36.002
The people around Benazir, the
security people, failed her.

00:39:36.002 --> 00:39:37.710
Because they didn't
protector adequately.

00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:39.540
And I have a lot
of anecdotes aside

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:42.120
from the fact that the
backup vehicle wasn't

00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:45.130
there when it should have been.

00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:48.190
The United States and the
UK promoted her return

00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:50.990
but they wouldn't take any
responsibility for her safety.

00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:53.650
In fact, they said at
the beginning, well,

00:39:53.650 --> 00:40:01.100
we look at hiring Blackwater
or some other outfit.

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:03.530
And then Musharraf
did not allow anybody

00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:07.770
from abroad, any foreigner
to perform police duties.

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:13.660
In addition to
that, my perception

00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:18.980
was that Musharraf
was a facilitator.

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:24.470
Because he did not provide the
security that she deserved.

00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:27.530
They knew that she
had been attacked.

00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:29.980
They passed on to
her information

00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:33.820
about cells that were
bent on attacking her.

00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:36.540
But they passed on information
to wash their hands

00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:38.750
about the duty to protect her.

00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:40.570
So they were part of it, too.

00:40:40.570 --> 00:40:45.810
And, in the end, my perception
was that most Pakistani actors

00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:47.810
would rather turn
the page than to know

00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:50.270
exactly what had
happened to her.

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:54.031
So there were many-- the village
assassinated her, in a sense.

00:40:54.031 --> 00:40:56.030
There were too many people
that wanted her dead.

00:41:00.887 --> 00:41:02.720
AUDIENCE: This is a bit
of a naive question,

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:05.217
I think, but, I'm
from California

00:41:05.217 --> 00:41:07.300
and I've lived in the
United States my whole life.

00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:11.280
And I just wonder--
let's see, I'm

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:14.670
trying to think how
to pose the question.

00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:19.230
How it feels like living in
a place where there's not

00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:23.310
law and order in the sense
that I think of it here,

00:41:23.310 --> 00:41:27.390
like under Pinochet,
or under Musharraf.

00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:30.744
I mean, is daily life for
people substantially different?

00:41:30.744 --> 00:41:32.410
I mean, you've lived
here for some time,

00:41:32.410 --> 00:41:36.790
so you have a good
sense of that.

00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:41.830
HERALDO MUNOZ: Well,
I would say that Chile

00:41:41.830 --> 00:41:47.750
under the dictatorship was
very difficult to live under.

00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:50.000
And, in the end, you adjust.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.840
And if you decide to
confront the dictatorship,

00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:56.040
becomes dangerous.

00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:58.910
And in the case of Pakistan,
it's a little bit different.

00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:03.350
The society has become
more radicalized.

00:42:03.350 --> 00:42:06.540
It was always a very
sophisticated society.

00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:09.260
It has a strong middle class.

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:10.850
A very learned elite.

00:42:13.882 --> 00:42:18.440
And that began to change with
Zia-ul-Haq, in the late 1970s

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:19.260
and '80s.

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:23.250
When this radicalization,
Islamist radicalization began.

00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:25.290
You know, the army
used to have dinners

00:42:25.290 --> 00:42:29.010
that they ended
drinking port wine.

00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:35.800
All of that was changed when
the strict Islamic tradition

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:37.730
was instituted.

00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:41.740
And Sharia law and all.

00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:49.790
So that then the society
became different.

00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:52.460
Of course, people
continued drinking.

00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:54.010
And there was an
article yesterday

00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:59.040
in "Dawn," the
major newspaper, how

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:01.040
drinking alcohol was
driven underground.

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:05.050
But it's still all
over the place.

00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:09.210
And it became a bit
more difficult to live.

00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:11.040
Because I remember
having gone to

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:14.830
Islamabad many years
ago, before this mission.

00:43:14.830 --> 00:43:17.600
And Islamabad being
a very nice city.

00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:22.840
Well, today it has all
kinds of-- every few blocks,

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:27.530
roadblocks, manned by individual
with guns and sand sacks

00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:29.460
and all that.

00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:31.100
And that has changed.

00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:33.360
It has become a lot
more vulnerable.

00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:37.400
But people go on
living their lives.

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:40.357
It's a sophisticated country,
sophisticated society.

00:43:40.357 --> 00:43:42.440
In the case of Chile it
was more or less the same.

00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:44.310
You go on living.

00:43:44.310 --> 00:43:47.950
But it becomes
difficult at some times.

00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:53.970
I mean, my life was
threatened a couple of times.

00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:57.340
But then you decide
that it is worth it

00:43:57.340 --> 00:43:58.860
because there's high objectives.

00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:03.045
I was arrested in Chile.

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:09.390
My family did not like the
idea of me staying in Chile

00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:11.460
but we lived and
lived through it.

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:17.430
But it's very different
when you come to US,

00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:21.030
you see the differences.

00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:24.240
During a dictatorship,
you don't talk in a bus.

00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:27.440
Because don't talk policy
because somebody might hear you

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:29.230
that may denounce you.

00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:31.640
You are very defensive.

00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:35.890
And that, I think,
is a frame of mind

00:44:35.890 --> 00:44:37.620
that, obviously,
you don't have here.

00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:42.360
And things are quite
different in that sense.

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:45.980
You distrust a lot of
people that you don't know.

00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:52.330
You are with a strong circle
of friends and family.

00:44:52.330 --> 00:44:56.680
And that happens under
repression, under dictatorship.

00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:59.110
But today, Pakistan,
to go back to Pakistan,

00:44:59.110 --> 00:45:03.770
I think is more hopeful
than anything else.

00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:06.370
Because, for the
first time ever,

00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:09.650
a government finished
a full period

00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:14.510
without being kicked out,
without being a coup d'etat.

00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:16.900
President Zardari
finished his term

00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:21.590
and he handed over power to a
newly elected, democratically

00:45:21.590 --> 00:45:25.930
elected, government of
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.

00:45:25.930 --> 00:45:29.180
And that was a first
ever in Pakistan.

00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:32.430
The problems today in Pakistan
are more development issues.

00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:39.150
Electric power, issues of
true security, a country that

00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:42.015
produced enough to feed
all of its populations

00:45:42.015 --> 00:45:43.690
instead of import a lot.

00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:46.300
Issue of energy is fundamental.

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:49.230
There are other issues that,
today, are more important.

00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:52.320
And the radical groups have
always been a minority.

00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:54.370
They never won an election.

00:45:54.370 --> 00:45:56.450
They never won a
national election.

00:45:56.450 --> 00:45:59.870
So, in the end,
there's more of a taste

00:45:59.870 --> 00:46:03.980
for an inclusive
society more and more.

00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:07.580
If not secular, at least
inclusive and tolerant rather

00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:14.070
than the strict,
extremist views that tend

00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:16.060
to be a minority in Pakistan.

00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:17.730
And in the case of
Chile, as I said,

00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:19.610
it's a different situation.

00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:21.240
But we defeated a dictator.

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:26.170
And today we've had in a
20 some years of democracy.

00:46:26.170 --> 00:46:31.530
And a woman elected
president of Chile.

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:35.720
The first woman elected prime
minister of an Islamist state

00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:37.300
was Benazir Bhutto.

00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:42.670
And very possibly next weekend,
and I'm going to Chile to vote,

00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:45.240
Michelle Bachelet
will be re-elected

00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:47.548
president of Chile,
I hope, at least.

00:46:52.039 --> 00:46:52.580
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:54.765
What's the evidence
against Musharraf?

00:46:54.765 --> 00:46:59.460
And do you think he is the right
person to stand trial for this?

00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:02.070
HERALDO MUNOZ: Well
it's not for me to say.

00:47:02.070 --> 00:47:06.540
It is for the Pakistani
courts to decide.

00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:09.350
And they opened up a case.

00:47:09.350 --> 00:47:11.710
An anti-terrorist
court in Rawalpindi

00:47:11.710 --> 00:47:14.110
opened up a case on
the assassination

00:47:14.110 --> 00:47:15.450
of Benazir Bhutto.

00:47:15.450 --> 00:47:20.240
And decided to indict Musharraf.

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:23.360
They took a lot of the
elements of our report,

00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:25.760
but they have
their own evidence.

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:31.040
They have their
own means of proof.

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:34.100
And that's why I've
always said, it's

00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:36.760
not up to anybody
outside Pakistan

00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:39.040
to determine who did this.

00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:42.880
It's up to the
Pakistani justice system

00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:47.780
to exonerate or to
declare culpability.

00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:50.340
And that's what they're
doing right now.

00:47:50.340 --> 00:48:00.140
So far different courts
have indicted and condemned

00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:02.400
the chief of police
of Rawalpindi

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:04.180
and the deputy chief of police.

00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:07.420
Both removed from their posts.

00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:10.070
And others have been removed
from their responsibilities

00:48:10.070 --> 00:48:13.500
and put into an exit list.

00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:17.210
In other words, they cannot
leave the country until

00:48:17.210 --> 00:48:23.660
their situation in
court is cleared up.

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:28.280
So a lot has happened and
in the case of Musharraf,

00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:32.840
the evidence has been
gathered by this court.

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:35.560
By the way, the state
prosecutor in the case

00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:37.990
of Benazir Bhutto in
this Rawalpindi court

00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:39.610
was assassinated.

00:48:39.610 --> 00:48:44.420
About six months ago or so.

00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:46.510
Her body was riddled
with bullets.

00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:49.541
Many people say because of
the Benazir Bhutto case.

00:48:49.541 --> 00:48:51.290
Others say that it
could have been because

00:48:51.290 --> 00:48:54.230
of other cases
involving militants.

00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:05.840
We have no evidence
that we could present

00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:09.310
except the political one,
the political responsibility.

00:49:09.310 --> 00:49:11.310
It was his responsibility
to protect her.

00:49:11.310 --> 00:49:12.700
He didn't.

00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:15.040
He didn't do it adequately.

00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:16.680
And there's all
these other elements.

00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:22.930
And, in the end, she sent a
letter to Wolf Blitzer of CNN.

00:49:22.930 --> 00:49:26.210
And said, shortly before
the assassination,

00:49:26.210 --> 00:49:31.400
saying, if I'm assassinated
is because of minions--

00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:36.160
and used the word minions--
around Musharraf who did it.

00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:38.985
But evidently, all of that
has to be proved in court.

00:49:38.985 --> 00:49:40.610
And that's what is
happening right now.

00:49:43.244 --> 00:49:45.910
MALE SPEAKER: I think that's all
the time we have for questions.

00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:48.590
Thank you very much for
coming to Google and speaking.

00:49:48.590 --> 00:49:50.590
HERALDO MUNOZ: Thanks to
you for the invitation.

00:49:50.590 --> 00:49:51.190
Appreciate it.

00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:54.490
[APPLAUSE]
