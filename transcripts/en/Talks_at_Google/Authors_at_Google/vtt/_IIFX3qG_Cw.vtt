VAN RIPER: I'm here to
welcome Austin Hill Shaw.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.990
He has his book out, "The
Shoreline of Wonder: On

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:09.840
Being Creative."

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.390
It'll be available after
the talk for $10.00.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.592
If you're interested,
see Dave here.

00:00:15.592 --> 00:00:17.550
For those of you who
don't know, I'm Van Riper.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.130
I'm the gPause program
manager here at Google.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.350
And one of the really
pleasures of my job

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.290
is to be involved in
setting up these events.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.581
But I want to give a call
out to Rachael O'Meara, who's

00:00:27.581 --> 00:00:30.100
been a great 20% volunteer
for this program.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.686
Couldn't be here today, but
she does the vast majority

00:00:32.686 --> 00:00:34.560
of the work of setting
up these gPause talks,

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.500
and couldn't be doing
this without her help.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.330
So I wanted to mention that.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.090
And then I also wanted to say,
people sometimes here at Google

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.230
think that gPause
is about group sits.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.960
And I just want to
take this opportunity

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.310
at the beginning of this to say
it's really about supporting

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.150
Googlers living more mindfully.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.280
And we believe that meditation
practice is one of those ways

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.055
to help people to do that.

00:00:58.055 --> 00:00:59.930
I think this talk today
is really interesting

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.650
because we're talking
about creativity,

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.580
and I think our mindfulness
practice, whatever

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.755
form it takes, can
really inform that.

00:01:06.755 --> 00:01:08.880
I know the logo-- I don't
have it up here with me--

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.070
but the gPause logo has
that little video pause

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.730
symbol in there.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.839
And it is important
to take those pauses,

00:01:16.839 --> 00:01:18.380
and that's what our
program is about.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.430
But we live most of
our life in flow, just

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.720
like the video in play.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.490
But it's that time we take
for the pause can really

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.641
add to the quality of the flow,
and help with creativity and so

00:01:33.641 --> 00:01:34.140
forth.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.310
And I know that Austin is going
to talk a lot more about that.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.055
So it's my pleasure to
introduce Austin Hill Shaw.

00:01:43.055 --> 00:01:48.010
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.150
AUSTIN HILL SHAW: Thank you
so much for having me here.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.420
The wonderful thing about
having a talk planned,

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.570
especially around things such
as mindfulness, creativity,

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.940
and the workplace,
is that is allows

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.890
me to create sort of a
cauldron in my own mind

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.790
by which I'm trying
to understand

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.070
the information
better and better

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.840
so that I can present it in a
way that is succinct and has

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.252
a framework that's unified.

00:02:15.252 --> 00:02:17.460
And there's nothing more
that I love than doing that.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.550
My mind loves to be in this
space of creating frameworks,

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.350
and trying to understand
some of the things that,

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.070
for me, are some of the most
important aspects of being

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.150
human.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.420
And it's really interesting
to have that opportunity

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.050
to do that.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.580
And I'm really happy to
be here, because this

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.270
is the opportunity,
this is the place where

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.210
that starts to get presented.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.310
So this is a place where I get
to be spontaneous, and also,

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.740
help, with your help,
in order to understand

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.280
the material better.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.880
But before I get
started, first of all,

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.540
I want to thank Van for all your
work in helping me get here.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.880
And also Rachael O'Meara.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.630
This talk would
not have happened

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.590
without Rachel O'Meara.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.280
We met a couple years ago at
the Wisdom 2.0 conference,

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.760
and she was writing a
book called "Pause."

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.970
And pauses are incredibly
important in our busy time.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.640
And we'll talk about what
those pauses actually

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.740
start to look like.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.840
Anyways, I'm really
indebted to her.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.290
And I'm also indebted,
of course, to Google.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.400
In preparing for this, I
recognized the first time

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.990
I ever heard about
something called Google

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.760
as an organization, I was
in Cuernevaca, Mexico,

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.190
in 2001, working on
a children's library,

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.050
where it was a
design build project.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.200
So we were basically mixing
concrete by hand all day,

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.790
and pouring columns.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.970
And so almost every evening we
had a tequila tasting, where

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.550
we would sort of relax.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.550
And during one of
those tequila tastings,

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.270
a person came up
and said, hey, you

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.250
got to check out
this search engine.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.390
It's amazing.

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.180
It's called Google.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.830
And during the
tequila tasting, I

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.270
thought, first of all, what's so
amazing about a search engine?

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.769
This is 2001.

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.120
And two, what an interesting
name for something,

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.360
to have something as the
biggest number is possible.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.290
And here you are, this
massive organization

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:32.760
with all these tentacles
out into the world.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.710
So it's really an
honor to be here,

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.120
and it's an honor to be
part of the gPause program.

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:46.670
So today I would like to begin
with a little bit of a sense

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.590
of where this all comes from.

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:55.580
And in 2004, I was participating
in a three-month meditation

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:56.270
retreat.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.260
It's called a traditional
rainy season retreat.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.240
And during that retreat,
I was getting a teaching

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.240
on what's called
the Wheel of Life.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.890
And the Wheel of
Life is essentially

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.730
a teaching about how people
get stuck in habitual patterns.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.920
It's what's called a Hinayana
teaching in Tibetan Buddhism.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.680
But it's basically a map
of how people get stuck,

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.130
including hope and fear,
what are called the six

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.930
realms, and even what's
called the 12 Nidanas,

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.060
in terms of how we habitually
relate to the world.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.800
And during this talk, I had
just graduated from architecture

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.980
school a couple years earlier.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.040
And I thought to myself when I
saw this, I thought, you know,

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.020
that's not only a map of what
they call samsara, or confused

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.010
existence.

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.910
It's also a map of how
people get stuck creatively.

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:49.070
And that planted a
seed in my mind in 2004

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.860
that has never left.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.060
It's something that I just
mull over all the time.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.900
And the really question
was is, what is creativity?

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:02.480
What is this thing that has such
universal appeal, but is often,

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.895
I think, so misunderstood?

00:06:04.895 --> 00:06:06.520
So we're going to
start to unpack that,

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.420
and we're going to unpack
that within the context

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:13.720
of mindfulness and
creativity, and also how

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.780
this applies to the workplace.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:27.870
So before we go on, I'd like
to start with the end in mind

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.880
about where we're actually
going to with this presentation.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.430
And what I mean
by that is that I

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.230
want to have the vision
about where we're

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:40.150
going as we start to think
about mindfulness and creativity

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.450
together.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.440
And for me, it has
to do with basically

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.030
what we call the connecting
of heaven and earth.

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:48.780
The type of Buddhism
that I practice

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:53.010
is called Vajrayana Buddhism,
which is Tibetan Buddhism.

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:56.020
But the idea behind Vajrayana.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:00.060
Vajra means lightning
bolt. And it really

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.620
is that sense is that what
you're doing in the Vajrayana

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.550
lineage, and in the
practice, is you're

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.910
connecting heaven and earth.

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:15.350
That means you're trying to take
these big, spiritual, religious

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:20.780
ideas, but root them into
everyday ordinary existence,

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:25.830
and not just certain
existences, but everything,

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:29.530
everything that you do,
to weave that awareness.

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:31.530
Another word for
Vajrayana is tantra,

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:33.500
and tantra means thread.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.930
It's a thread of
awareness that you're

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.060
weaving through all activities.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.180
So we can see the
similarity right now

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:44.820
between the Vajrayana
and mindfulness,

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.387
where we're going with that.

00:07:46.387 --> 00:07:47.970
But what I want to
do is really create

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:52.290
a spot, a spot that
represents that place.

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:54.020
And it's experience.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.860
It's really beyond words.

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:59.600
But I want you to invite you all
to step into that spot with me.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.790
I'm going to put it right here.

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:04.200
Right here is where
that spot's going to be.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:07.400
But before I go there, I want to
recognize, when I come in here,

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.530
I have my own hopes and fears.

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:12.290
I have my own ideas on
how this is going to go.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.850
I have my own nervousness
about the experience,

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:17.650
about what may or
may not happen.

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:20.360
And yet at the same
time, what I want to do

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.800
is surrender so that I
can be in that flow space

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.990
that Van was talking
about earlier.

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:26.700
So I'd like your
help in doing that.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.731
And I want you to go
there with me, OK?

00:08:29.731 --> 00:08:31.730
So on the count of three,
I'm going to step out.

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:33.960
Again, here's my partial
reality over here.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.945
And in just a moment,
on the count of three,

00:08:35.945 --> 00:08:37.320
I'm going to step
into the space,

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.820
into the vajra space where I'm
connecting heaven and earth,

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.659
OK?

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:45.400
One, two, three.

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:59.720
So this is the vajra space.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.220
And this space, even though
it has a fancy-sounding name,

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:06.810
it's something that
everybody experiences.

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:10.210
These practices of
mindfulness, meditation,

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:12.670
and even the things that
we do in creativity,

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:17.750
are all geared to getting this
into this space, because when

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:23.040
we're here, there's a meaning to
our life that is beyond words.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.292
It's ineffable.

00:09:24.292 --> 00:09:26.250
Then the other thing that
happens in this space

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:30.810
is not that we're passive,
nor are we like hamsters

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:32.120
on a hamster wheel.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:37.480
We are in a space that
the Taoists would wu wei,

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:41.700
actionless non-doing,
a place where

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:48.180
being human and being
creative and being aware

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:52.200
are happening just naturally.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.810
And I want you to close
your eyes for a moment,

00:09:54.810 --> 00:10:01.300
just close your eyes, and
allow yourself to picture

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.990
an instant in your
life where you've

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:10.040
been in this place,
where you have

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:19.454
that sense of profound,
enlivening connectedness

00:10:19.454 --> 00:10:20.120
with everything.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.320
And not only that,
you were doing things.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.510
You had this feeling
of making a difference.

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:40.500
And even beyond that,
you had this experience

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:41.675
of feeling alive.

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:52.150
And notice how this experience
is not something exotic,

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:54.420
but it's actually home.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:54.975
This is home.

00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:59.300
It feels so good to
be here because this

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:02.220
is what we are meant to do.

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:05.330
We're meant to be aware
and use our awareness.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.410
We are meant to create and act
upon our innate creativity.

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:13.170
And we were meant to
connect with others.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:16.750
We're meant to exercise our
humanity in a cooperation

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:20.250
that's built into our DNA.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.870
Even with people that we
don't fully understand,

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:29.376
we have this incredible
ability to cooperate and learn

00:11:29.376 --> 00:11:30.125
from other people.

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:39.990
So you can open your eyes again.

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:46.880
So back in the '90s,
the late '80s and '90s,

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.230
my first love, in
terms of probably

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:53.940
a mindfulness practice,
was rock climbing.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:59.860
And for 10 years I threw
myself into that sport.

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:04.350
And the reason that I
loved rock climbing so much

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:07.650
was because it put
me in this flow state

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:12.080
where I was using my physical
body, I was managing my fear

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:15.300
and planning my energy.

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:20.900
And I was connecting
with nature.

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.150
I spent lots of
times in Yosemite.

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:25.350
I've climbed all the
formations there,

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:28.110
all the major formations.

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:32.640
And just being on those
1,000-foot spaces,

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.350
moving up little crystals
and crack systems,

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:39.910
and feeling this sense
of your smallness,

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:44.210
your tininess in this
immense environment,

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:49.590
was incredibly
enlivening for me.

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:55.535
And it was also a bit of
an addiction, addicted

00:12:55.535 --> 00:12:58.940
to the adrenalized
experience, addicted

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:00.240
to those sorts of things.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:04.160
Addicted to wanting to be
there pushing boundaries.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.670
And I even-- the
person who got me

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:08.890
into climbing, who was my
best friend in college,

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:12.230
died in a climbing
accident in 1996.

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:16.610
So part of what
has led my path so

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:19.480
of wanting to know more about
what it means to be human

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.130
was that immense
loss in my life,

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:25.100
of not having that person there
anymore that I loved so much,

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:27.305
and who took me to
these incredible spaces.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.149
And so when I talk
about this first of all.

00:13:32.149 --> 00:13:33.690
I want to talk about
this place which

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:38.720
is opposite of creativity,
the opposite of creativity.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.470
What might that be?

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:42.580
Just imagine what that
might be in your mind.

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:46.860
What is the opposite
space of creativity?

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.310
Any idea?

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:50.310
Just think about that.

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:51.294
What's that?

00:13:51.294 --> 00:13:53.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] a lot
things at the same time.

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:54.930
AUSTIN HILL SHAW:
Multitasking, doing a lot

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:56.055
of things at the same time.

00:13:56.055 --> 00:13:57.945
Great, great.

00:13:57.945 --> 00:13:59.334
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:59.334 --> 00:14:01.000
AUSTIN HILL SHAW:
Being in a rut, right?

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:01.970
Being in a rut.

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:03.344
OK.

00:14:03.344 --> 00:14:04.240
AUDIENCE: Conformity.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:04.860
AUSTIN HILL SHAW: Conformity.

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:05.870
Yeah, exactly.

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:07.245
Conformity is one of those.

00:14:07.245 --> 00:14:08.620
So I've thought
about this a lot.

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.630
I used to think that the
opposite of creativity

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:12.140
was destruction.

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:14.330
But I realized that's
a paired opposite.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.950
Any time something is created,
something else is destroyed.

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:20.470
If I sit down in front
of a piece of paper

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:22.940
to go write something,
that piece of paper

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:26.560
is transformed from a
blank sheet of paper to now

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:30.600
it's got marking on it, and
my pen is slowly bloodlet.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:36.730
So destruction is a natural
pairing with creativity.

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:39.950
But the opposite of
creativity, as an experience,

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:43.559
is addiction, addiction.

00:14:43.559 --> 00:14:45.100
I got that from
reading a book called

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:47.506
"In the Realm of
the Hungry Ghost:

00:14:47.506 --> 00:14:48.880
Close Encounters
with Addiction,"

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.300
which I'd highly
recommend to you,

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:53.330
by a guy named Dr. Gabor Mate.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.280
And there's another
book called "Cutting

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.410
Through Spiritual
Materialism" by a guy named

00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:02.750
Chogyam Trungpa, where he
talked about, in our lives,

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:04.970
we are addicted to
three basic things.

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:07.140
He called them the three
lords of materialism.

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:10.970
We're addicted to
materialistic things.

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:15.810
We're addicted to
concepts and world views.

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:20.460
And we're also addicted
to spiritual experiences,

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:21.810
including substance abuse.

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:24.930
It falls into those areas.

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:27.940
And Trungpa said
basically, you don't

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:31.020
have to struggle to be free.

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:32.850
You don't have to
struggle to be free.

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:35.630
Freedom itself is the
absence of struggle.

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:37.630
And when you see
yourself in that space,

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:40.330
in the vajra space,
which is your nature,

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.780
there's no struggle.

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:46.070
The world's no longer a series
of obstacles or coincidences,

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:46.930
or this or that.

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:48.460
It's synchronicity.

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:49.780
It's magic.

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:52.700
It's flow.

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:57.010
So that's the opposite
of creativity.

00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:59.870
The opposite of
creativity is addiction.

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:02.610
I'm going to walk over
here for a second,

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:06.020
and let's talk a little
bit about mindfulness

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:09.500
and try to identify with the
opposite of mindfulness is.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:10.630
Any ideas on that?

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.230
Ignorance.

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:19.930
Ignorance definitely has
a component of that, yes.

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:20.430
Other ideas?

00:16:24.122 --> 00:16:25.350
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:26.600
AUSTIN HILL SHAW: What's that?

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:27.475
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:29.532 --> 00:16:31.490
AUSTIN HILL SHAW: So
having a sense of presence

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:33.180
is a part of the
mindfulness, yeah.

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:35.150
So I agree with that.

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:37.505
OK, good.

00:16:37.505 --> 00:16:38.450
AUDIENCE: Obsession.

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:39.430
AUSTIN HILL SHAW:
Obsession, right.

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:39.929
Yeah.

00:16:39.929 --> 00:16:43.600
Just this sort of, a
lot of mental activity.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:48.840
So when I booked this
talk with Rachel and Van,

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:52.730
I booked it right before
I went into the mountains

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:54.030
with my dear friend William.

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:57.330
I'm 45 years old and I've
known this person for 45 years.

00:16:57.330 --> 00:16:59.890
And he is the one that
got me into meditation

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:02.160
in the first place.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.700
And I went up there, and on the
first day, we're up at 11,500

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:07.930
place, and a place we've
been going for 11 years,

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:09.890
where we go practice
high in the Sierras.

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:15.099
And I said, William, can
you help me understand

00:17:15.099 --> 00:17:17.599
this phenomenon of mindfulness?

00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:20.720
Because with all the
hype around it right now,

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:24.250
I really have no idea
what it is anymore.

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:26.780
And so we talked about that.

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:29.355
And we're going to get
into what I think it is.

00:17:29.355 --> 00:17:30.730
But I want to give
you an example

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:33.290
of how the opposite
of mindfulness

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:35.720
works itself out in my own life.

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:39.500
So I don't consider
myself to be a good cook.

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:42.860
I grew up in a household
where food was not valued.

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:45.880
And it just was about
getting fuel in us,

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:49.550
but it wasn't a joyful
presentation, by any means.

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:52.970
And so when I find
myself in a kitchen,

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:55.510
I really feel like I
have to concentrate.

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:58.780
I have to do work
in order to keep

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:01.960
all the different things going.

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.860
And I found myself, often,
at the cutting board.

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:08.270
And I'll actually start to get
myself into a semi-flow state

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:09.830
every now and then.

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:12.620
And inevitably what
happens is, I think,

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:18.640
gosh, I'm being so mindful
right now, so mindful.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.560
And inevitably I'll almost
cut off one of my digits,

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.745
or something like
that, or something

00:18:23.745 --> 00:18:25.460
will spill all over the place.

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:30.390
And it's like, oh,
that's not mindfulness.

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:32.500
Whoops.

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.090
So the question is,
what is mindfulness?

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:38.230
And really, the relationship
and mindfulness and creativity,

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:41.712
and the way that I understand
it, go totally hand in hand.

00:18:41.712 --> 00:18:43.170
And there's different
levels of it,

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:44.961
and those are where
we're going to explore.

00:18:44.961 --> 00:18:47.610
The different
types of creativity

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:50.550
and the different
types of mindfulness

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:52.100
really go hand in hand.

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:55.570
And you have to understand,
I started this venture

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:58.700
on what is creativity outside
of a meditation retreat.

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:03.140
So these two are just like
braided together in my mind.

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:05.390
But we're really going to
start to get a sense of what

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:07.190
that looks like.

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:12.014
So let's-- first of all,
before we go into that,

00:19:12.014 --> 00:19:14.680
I just want to create something,
which is what I call the ground

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:16.130
of creativity.

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:18.630
And the ground of
creativity is basically

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:21.550
whatever is that
organizing force that

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:26.642
has been here since the
beginning of the universe.

00:19:26.642 --> 00:19:28.850
I mean, if you think about
it, the only elements that

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:30.520
were in the beginning
of the universe

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.450
were mostly hydrogen,
some helium,

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:34.690
and trace amounts of lithium.

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:36.790
Just three elements, right?

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:41.850
And now some 14 billion
years later, we have this.

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:42.950
I mean, it's incredible.

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:44.394
Like I have the
screen over here,

00:19:44.394 --> 00:19:45.810
and somebody's
talking on the mic,

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:47.370
you know, adjusting the sound.

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:49.730
He's not even here, and he's
orchestrating this thing.

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:52.960
I mean, it's crazy what
we've come up with.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.830
And so before we even start
talking about human creativity,

00:19:56.830 --> 00:20:00.144
we need to talk about the
creativity of the universe.

00:20:00.144 --> 00:20:01.560
And the interesting
thing about it

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:07.010
is, in this phase of creativity,
there's no mindfulness at all.

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:11.960
Mindfulness and awareness
exist as a potentiality.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.740
There's one view
of Buddhist thought

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:18.300
that says that actually the
universe is brought into being

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.960
and goes through this
period of self-organizing

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:24.285
so that you can get conscious,
self-aware beings so

00:20:24.285 --> 00:20:27.550
that the practice of ripening
and working with karma

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:29.500
can start again
from the imprints

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:31.330
of the previous universe.

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:34.200
And I love that idea, that
you go for-- again, it's

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.821
been about 14 billion years.

00:20:35.821 --> 00:20:37.820
And now suddenly, in this
little window of time,

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:40.150
we have come to self-aware
beings, at least

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:43.810
in this neck of the woods,
working on our stuff.

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:47.800
We're all working on
our stuff on some level.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.370
So what are the three
principles of what I

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:53.120
call the ground of creativity?

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:57.010
One is what I call dynamism.

00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:59.680
Dynamism is basically
that things are always

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.190
moving and changing.

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:03.210
Everything is
moving and changing.

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:04.850
And within the
spiritual realm, this

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:06.330
is the laws of impermanence.

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:08.985
Nothing lasts forever.

00:21:08.985 --> 00:21:11.110
And so that's something
that we have to relate with

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:15.520
in order to
understand our lives,

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.310
and organize our
lives around that,

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:20.150
because the changes
in things are

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:25.550
one of the things that actually
promote our creativity.

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:29.680
Now if we go over here, the
next thing that we have,

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:33.630
which is related,
is interdependence.

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:35.550
Things are always changing,
but they're always

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:38.560
changing in relationship
to other things.

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:40.450
Think of the law of
universal gravitation,

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:43.950
that everything out
there in the universe,

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:47.449
all the matter out there
is affecting other matter.

00:21:47.449 --> 00:21:49.490
And then you step into
the third component, which

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:52.560
is essentially, sometimes when
I'm talking to organizations,

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:55.730
like business organizations,
I call it diversity.

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:57.760
But my favorite word
for it is, going back

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:02.540
into the center, mystery,
or mysterious complexity.

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:04.980
We really don't know
how the universe began--

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:07.250
even though we have a
theory-- or what's before it.

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:11.020
We really don't know how
life began, although there's

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:11.982
ideas around it.

00:22:11.982 --> 00:22:14.440
And we really don't know where
conscious self-awareness is.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.950
These things that we
rely upon every day that

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:20.550
are the groundwork
of our lives, we

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:24.400
are not even totally sure
how they came into being.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:28.260
So mystery is not a
thing that's a bad thing.

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:31.900
When we're able to
step into that mystery,

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:35.920
we find our lives being
really-- how should I

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:40.270
say-- full of wonder.

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:43.620
When we can drop the need
to know all the time,

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:46.537
we drop into this
space of wonder.

00:22:46.537 --> 00:22:48.120
That's why I titled
my book, actually,

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.240
after many years of
thinking about it,

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:52.750
"The Shoreline of Wonder:
On Being Creative."

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:54.990
It comes from a quote
from a Methodist minister,

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:58.990
who I wrongly ascribed the book
to a guy named Huston Smith,

00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:02.090
who's a religious scholar.

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:06.250
And anyways, this
person said, "The larger

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:09.800
the island of knowledge,
the longer the shoreline

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.960
of wonder."

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:14.460
The larger the
island of knowledge,

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:16.720
the longer the
shoreline of wonder.

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:20.470
We know so much, right?

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:22.670
And that knowing
is great, but it

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:25.930
is unbelievably eclipsed
by all the things

00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:29.890
that we can't know, we won't
know, we'll never know,

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:32.260
and yet are allowing us
to live out our lives.

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:34.820
So that sense of mystery.

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:36.420
So again, the
ground of creativity

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:41.150
consists of dynamism,
interdependence, and mystery.

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:43.900
Now before we go on
with that, I want

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:46.110
to do one quick
reading from the book,

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:50.030
but I would love to have
my friend Dada do it.

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:51.333
Would you do that?

00:23:51.333 --> 00:23:52.160
DADA: Yeah.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.660
AUSTIN HILL SHAW:
Please come on up.

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:56.910
Do we have the microphone here?

00:23:56.910 --> 00:23:59.674
This is Dada.

00:23:59.674 --> 00:24:00.590
DADA: Good to see you.

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:02.006
AUSTIN HILL SHAW:
This is a person

00:24:02.006 --> 00:24:04.340
who's obsessed with
creativity as much as I am.

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:05.173
DADA: We're friends.

00:24:08.462 --> 00:24:09.170
I love this book.

00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:11.100
And I love the way you
just described that image.

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:11.810
It really got me.

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:19.960
"It's all in there, waiting,
just waiting in the time

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:22.390
before time.

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:27.270
The universe, our universe,
packed unimaginably

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:31.090
tight, indistinguishably
tight, packed

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:34.860
into a single point, a
point infinitely smaller

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:39.280
than a grain of sand, the
rawest of raw materials

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:43.100
awaiting the miraculous
complexity of a single atom,

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:46.240
while the solids,
liquids, and gases

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:51.220
that will come from those
atoms, the stuff of the stars,

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:55.930
planets, and moons, indeed,
entire galaxies and clusters

00:24:55.930 --> 00:25:00.610
of galaxies, the cosmic winds,
the lines that will become

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:05.460
the horizons and the edges
of door frames, planes

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:10.190
that will become meadows and
the surfaces of alpine lakes.

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:12.930
And the volumes that will
become oceans and mountains

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:17.370
and bathtubs full of
splishy splashy toddlers.

00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:20.500
The light that will erupt
in the east each morning

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:23.950
and flood through
the kitchen window,

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:27.720
the future debates over
what to call Pluto,

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:32.450
the weight of autumn, and
the promise of spring.

00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:39.810
Orion's belt, Cassiopeia,
up and down, near and far,

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:41.470
left and right.

00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:43.730
The carbon atom,
the water molecule,

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:46.630
semiconductors,
bacteria and viruses,

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:50.810
fish and flowering plants,
the early nervous systems.

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:54.470
Indeed, conscious
self-awareness itself,

00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:59.990
the awareness of being
aware packed in there, too,

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:02.530
packed in there with
memory and language

00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:12.150
and with all those sparklers
of emotions, love, grief,

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:15.530
and anger, rubbing
shoulders with the asteroids

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:18.355
and their dark matter,
the possibilities of Jesus

00:26:18.355 --> 00:26:22.530
and Buddha and Muhammad
and Lao Tzu cohabitating

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:25.310
in dimensionless space.

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:29.490
The cave paintings of
Lascaux, the pyramids of Giza,

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:34.480
the sculptures of Bernini,
the paintings of Kandinsky,

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:37.950
the soulful jazz
improvisations of Miles Davis.

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:41.330
Polio and the vaccine for polio.

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:44.570
Waterfalls spectruming through
the colors of the rainbow,

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:48.940
moonlight on the mountains, and
the unrepeatable configuration

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:51.280
that is you.

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:57.630
All this floating in that
awesome sea of nothingness,

00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:02.360
packed, simply packed,
waiting, just waiting

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:06.110
like an unlit match
or a shrine box,

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:09.810
waiting like the
bedrock in a fault zone,

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:12.430
waiting like a
landmine in the jungle,

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:15.140
feeling, in its own
strange way, the feeling

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:19.020
of being so intensely
small, hot, and dense,

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:23.390
having absolutely no way of
knowing what it will become,

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:27.540
and yet becoming
everything with no need

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:31.130
to reconcile repress
anything, simply waiting

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:36.560
for that improbable moment that
nudge, that flick of the wrist,

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:43.380
the magic words
uttered, and boom--"

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:47.734
AUSTIN HILL SHAW: The
universe as we know it began.

00:27:47.734 --> 00:27:48.234
Thank you.

00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:00.900
So that sense of togetherness,
this timelessness,

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:05.070
this connectedness, that
experience of all the things,

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:09.290
that potentiality that was
there 14 billion years ago

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:11.500
and is now kind of
here right now--

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:15.750
that is the mystery and
the experience of being

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:18.370
in that creative space, of
connecting heaven and earth,

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:19.080
right?

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:22.340
Of sensing the
miraculousness of our lives.

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:27.250
s It's so easy to lose
touch that our lives

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:34.930
are so utterly dependent
on everything all the time.

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:38.950
And the beauty of our lives
is that as human beings--

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:40.890
this is often called
the desire realm,

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:43.640
but it's also called the
enjoyment realm-- we really

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:47.630
get to enjoy experiencing life.

00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:50.880
We get to eat food,
taste it, and our bodies

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.630
take care of the rest.

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:55.070
And beyond just that,
there's like a three-

00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:57.530
to five-pound mass of things
that aren't even our DNA.

00:28:57.530 --> 00:28:59.830
They're helping to process us.

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:05.290
This idea that us as individuals
is-- we're really ecosystems.

00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:09.700
We're ecosystems that are
here, but they stand outwards

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:11.260
to infinity, really.

00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:13.300
And that is the
ground of creativity.

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:15.390
And that's the thing
that we're tapping into,

00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:19.045
that sense when we're having
these moments that we're going

00:29:19.045 --> 00:29:21.300
to talk about in just a second.

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.480
So again, right here we have
the vajra space, remember?

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:25.960
That's the center.

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:27.770
That's the center, OK?

00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:31.820
Now I want to step
into over here.

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:33.330
Vajra space here.

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:38.430
I'm over here in a place which I
call the experience of insight,

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:40.320
the experience of insight.

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:43.270
And this is the
aspect of creativity

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:46.070
where we have those aha moments.

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:49.540
Those aha moments where
it's a light bulb going off

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:51.090
on top of our heads.

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:56.170
And it has the experience
of something coming to us.

00:29:56.170 --> 00:30:01.080
So as a lover of
creativity and innovation,

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:04.730
one of my favorite
stories about the Bay Area

00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:09.310
comes from an insight that
still just blows my mind.

00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:13.680
And we have to go back to
Cincinnati, Ohio in 1889

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:15.740
to see where this
actually happened.

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:17.600
There was a gentleman
by the name of Joe

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:20.520
who was 19 years old
at the time and was

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:23.640
a sophomore at the
University of Cincinnati.

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:26.890
And he decided he was going to
go on for football practice.

00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:30.500
And he was Jewish in a time
of rampant anti-Semitism,

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:33.680
and he was only a little
bit over five feet tall.

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:37.630
And as the story goes, he
went out onto the field

00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:42.310
and was brutalized, brutalized
before practice even began,

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:46.040
brutalized so much that
he ended up in a hospital

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:48.420
on the banks of the Ohio River.

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:53.220
Well, Joe's bed-- he was in and
out of consciousness for two

00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:55.960
weeks, as the story goes.

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:56.945
He got throttled.

00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:02.130
So as the story
goes, here he is.

00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:04.430
He's in his hospital
bed, and he has

00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:07.340
a window that's looking
out over the Ohio River.

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:11.150
And spanning that river is
the longest suspension bridge

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:13.870
at the time in the world,
which was known as the John A.

00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:17.220
Roebling suspension bridge,
designed by the same guy who

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:18.945
designed the Brooklyn Bridge.

00:31:18.945 --> 00:31:21.070
And we don't know what
happened in those two weeks.

00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:24.492
But we can imagine, again, him
in and out of consciousness,

00:31:24.492 --> 00:31:26.450
that he's probably saying
to himself, you know,

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:30.220
I'm not going to be a
very good football player.

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:33.610
But I might be a
good bridge builder.

00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:35.360
Because that young
Joe would go on

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:38.430
to be Joseph Strauss, who was
the chief designer and engineer

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:41.630
of the Golden Gate Bridge.

00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:45.700
So this is an
experience of insight.

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:49.180
And the way that I
understood this was actually,

00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:51.470
I looked around for,
what is an insight?

00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:52.970
What are the defining features?

00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:55.360
A guy named William
James wrote a book called

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.890
"The Varieties of
Religious Experience,"

00:31:57.890 --> 00:32:00.140
specifically the
chapter of mysticism--

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:01.310
he gave it all to me.

00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:03.900
He said, basically a
mystical experience,

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:06.320
which is basically a unit
of experience with something

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:08.960
larger than yourself,
has these qualities.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:12.620
It's ineffable, it
is beyond words.

00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:17.110
It comes with a sense
of absolute truth.

00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:18.280
They're usually brief.

00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:22.650
They can be micro instances,
sometimes several hours,

00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:27.870
sometimes a series of days,
but not much longer than that.

00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:29.810
And they tend to be passive.

00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:31.350
Think of Joe on
his hospital bed.

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:32.850
He's having this
thing coming to him

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:34.550
in his most compromised state.

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:36.690
And the final thing
is, it happens

00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:40.330
in the minds of individuals.

00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:43.070
Often in mindfulness and
spiritual traditions,

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:45.580
you get the sense
that the individual

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:48.850
needs to let go of
their individuality.

00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:51.670
And I agree, we need to be
let go of the ego structures

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:56.250
that bind us and keep us
in addictive states, right?

00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:59.250
But it's great when
we actually recognize

00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:03.760
that our lens on the world
is unfathomably precious.

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:08.590
Nobody is ever going to see
the world quite the way we do.

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:10.730
And we're changing
all the time, too.

00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:14.600
So that experience of our
lens on the world in the here

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:18.280
now is unbelievably precious.

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:21.200
So this is the
experience of insight.

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:24.330
Now in the language
of mindfulness,

00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:27.419
this is what you're doing
when you're meditating.

00:33:27.419 --> 00:33:28.960
Specifically, when
you're meditating,

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:31.543
when you're doing what's called
Shamatha-VIpassana meditation,

00:33:31.543 --> 00:33:34.050
one type, which shamatha
means dwelling in peace,

00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:36.740
and vipassana that
means insight.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:41.600
The idea is that you're watching
a focal object, normally

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:43.480
your breath.

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:45.530
You're watching your
breath go in and out.

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:47.190
Sometimes you're
doing it sensorially.

00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:49.800
Sometimes you're riding
your breath experientially.

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:54.150
But you're focusing
on your breath.

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:58.300
Now, how many of you are
meditators in the room?

00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:01.280
How often would
you say that, when

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:03.330
you have your focal
object, are you actually

00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:04.640
on that focal object?

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:08.760
Let's say, like, maybe you're
there 90%, 95% of the time.

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:12.130
How many people do that
during their meditations?

00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:13.150
Good, OK.

00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:14.960
How about 50% of
the time that you're

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:18.340
actually watching your breath?

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:20.050
All right.

00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:22.810
What about-- let's
go 20% to 30%, maybe.

00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:23.310
All right?

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:23.810
Cool.

00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:24.540
All right.

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:27.929
What about most of the
session is basically you

00:34:27.929 --> 00:34:29.404
watching your mind go vrrrrrr.

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:40.381
So the thing about mindfulness
is that, really, mindfulness--

00:34:40.381 --> 00:34:42.130
I mean, we don't want
to beat ourselves up

00:34:42.130 --> 00:34:43.960
when we're looking
for this awareness.

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:47.030
Mindfulness is in
this context is just

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:50.880
a realization that we
actually are thinking

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:54.100
and that we need to
go back to the breath.

00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:55.330
Does that makes sense?

00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:58.250
It's just that awareness that
allows you at some point to go,

00:34:58.250 --> 00:34:59.110
hello.

00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:01.470
You're actually not
on the focal object.

00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:03.770
And so that moment-- even
though sometimes we go,

00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:07.529
aarrrgh, what am I doing?

00:35:07.529 --> 00:35:09.320
It's really, we should
be celebrating that.

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.903
It's like, oh, that's
the mindfulness.

00:35:10.903 --> 00:35:14.500
It's allowing me to
return to the breath.

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:16.150
And in returning to
the breath, we're

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:20.080
returning to what we
would call wisdom.

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:21.670
Wisdom, in the
Buddhist tradition,

00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:26.580
is defined specifically
as primordial knowing

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:28.990
before thought intervenes.

00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:33.150
Primordial knowing before
thought intervenes.

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:35.320
Think of Joseph Strauss
there on the bed.

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:38.580
His executive functions are
probably not working so well.

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:40.125
And yet his primordial knowing?

00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:46.610
We're all indebted to that.

00:35:46.610 --> 00:35:49.620
I look at the Golden Gate
Bridge and I just want to cry,

00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:50.480
it's so beautiful.

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:54.190
The art deco, just the
span, looking at the camber

00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:55.540
from the East Bay.

00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:56.890
It's unreal.

00:35:56.890 --> 00:35:59.270
it's so beautiful.

00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:03.370
And it came from that
experience, that aha moment.

00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:06.261
So this is
mindfulness, phase one.

00:36:06.261 --> 00:36:07.635
And in the Buddhist
tradition, we

00:36:07.635 --> 00:36:08.920
would call this the Hinayana.

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:11.890
The focus is on the individual.

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:14.250
It means the narrow
path, the narrow path.

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:17.060
The Hinayana, the narrow path.

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:19.490
And the archetype
in this is what

00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:23.220
is called the arhat,
one who tries to exit

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:24.549
samsara and move into nirvana.

00:36:24.549 --> 00:36:25.215
They're exiting.

00:36:25.215 --> 00:36:27.600
They're wanting to exit
the cyclical existence

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:28.640
of the world.

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:31.500
That's the goal in this
realm here, all right?

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:34.190
So let's step off
there for a minute,

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:39.470
and let's go over here
now, on the opposite side,

00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:41.890
on the opposite side.

00:36:41.890 --> 00:36:46.030
This is what I
call manifestation.

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:50.690
And manifestation--
manifestation comes from manos,

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:53.020
you know, the word for hand.

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:56.600
And the idea is, we want to
take these ineffable experiences

00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:59.190
of insight and make them
something that we actually

00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:05.110
can touch, that can be
tangible, that we can feel.

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:10.890
So manifestation, in
this case, basically

00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:14.240
consists of just the opposite
of what we had over here, right?

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:18.020
Instead of being ineffable, we
need to be able to define it,

00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:19.145
all right?

00:37:19.145 --> 00:37:21.020
And then suddenly you
have this paradox here,

00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:23.600
which is like, well, then you
have absolute truth over here.

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:26.420
You have to be flexible.

00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:30.310
That's the thing, is your
insight in the moment, I think,

00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:32.190
is absolutely true.

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:37.069
But time goes on, and it may not
be true five seconds from then.

00:37:37.069 --> 00:37:39.110
It's almost like-- if
anybody's done the I Ching,

00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:40.377
it gives you a glimpse.

00:37:40.377 --> 00:37:42.210
You throw the I Ching,
and it's like, here's

00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:44.080
a glimpse of reality
in this moment.

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:46.470
But as you know, from
dynamism and interdependence,

00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:48.800
things are always changing.

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.490
Always changing.

00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:52.850
So again, we have to
define what we're doing,

00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:56.440
but we also need to be flexible.

00:37:56.440 --> 00:38:01.050
This is the phase where
we also have to be active.

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:06.700
We have to have a sense
of, we're doing things.

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:10.640
And we also-- this is the
sense of where, actually, we're

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:14.790
being active there,
and we're also learning

00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:20.040
to work with other people.

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:22.140
This is the phase
where we start to work

00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:25.160
in the spirit of the collective.

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:27.730
So those are the things that
we're starting to contact.

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:28.772
We're being active.

00:38:28.772 --> 00:38:30.230
We're going out in
the world, we're

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:31.580
working with other people.

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:35.100
That is the experience
of manifesting,

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:37.730
just the opposite of
what we have over there,

00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:40.240
just the opposite.

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:42.860
And so one of the things that
I love to think about here

00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:46.590
is that another way of
understanding manifestation

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:50.350
is-- do we have any Bassnectar
fans out in the audience?

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:53.160
Anybody ever heard
of Bassnectar?

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:57.440
So Bassnectar is a DJ that
actually was born in San Jose.

00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:00.000
And right now he's a
multimillion-dollar act.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.670
He's one of the biggest
touring acts out there

00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:07.700
in the electronic
dance music scene.

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:11.910
And Lorin had a moment
of insight, too.

00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:16.800
He was, as an 11-year-old
boy-- he's from San Jose,

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:20.220
and it was October of 1989.

00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:25.720
And suddenly he finds himself
with his mom in the car.

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:31.280
And suddenly, in October, the
Loma Prieta earthquake hits,

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:32.460
and there he is.

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:34.332
And I was actually 19
years old at the time,

00:39:34.332 --> 00:39:36.290
on the Berkeley campus
sitting at Sproul Plaza.

00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:37.920
So I know what that's like.

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:40.620
Suddenly around concrete
everything's shaking like this.

00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:42.290
But then there's
this distinct feeling

00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:46.675
of a water wave moving through,
moving through the landscape.

00:39:46.675 --> 00:39:47.550
I'll never forget it.

00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:48.470
It was so paradoxical.

00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:50.011
This was concrete,
but you could feel

00:39:50.011 --> 00:39:52.470
the elasticity of the earth.

00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:56.700
So anyways, Lorin is
basically an 11-year-old boy.

00:39:56.700 --> 00:40:00.030
And what he would start doing,
based on that experience,

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:02.990
is he would start to
try, in his own way--

00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:06.120
either consciously,
subconsciously-- to recreate

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:08.720
the energy of that cataclysm.

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:11.350
Who's been in an
earthquake before?

00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:12.157
OK?

00:40:12.157 --> 00:40:13.990
If you notice, when
you're in an earthquake,

00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:15.900
there's a couple
different things.

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:17.360
There can be fear, right?

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:19.640
We experience that.

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:20.840
But there's also amazement.

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:23.180
You're really
tapping into, again,

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:25.917
one, the dynamism of the earth,
but also the interdependence.

00:40:25.917 --> 00:40:28.000
It's like those plates
pushing against each other,

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.710
and one's suddenly slipping.

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:33.790
So Lorin started to explore
different things that

00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:34.830
had that energy.

00:40:34.830 --> 00:40:39.390
First of all, he was into metal,
like really heavy metal music,

00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:41.280
which had a lot of energy to it.

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.880
But then he discovered
the rave scene,

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:46.630
which is all about love and
community and people dancing.

00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:49.510
And simultaneously while
he's growing and having

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:53.460
these influences, Silicon
Valley is growing up,

00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:56.560
the technology is coming into
being, all the mixing things,

00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:00.350
all the sound, all the
speaker technology.

00:41:00.350 --> 00:41:02.110
They can do ultra
high frequencies

00:41:02.110 --> 00:41:05.340
and ultra low frequencies.

00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:08.050
And now he plays
these concerts that

00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:10.750
are just-- they're
immersive experiences where

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:13.990
he's building up
the energy, almost

00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:15.510
like the energy in the earth.

00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:21.150
And they does a drop, where you
get this unbelievably powerful

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:26.670
rolling bass line that just
moves through you like water.

00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:30.040
And for people who
like his music,

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:32.210
it's almost like a
spiritual experience.

00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:35.030
People walk out of there being,
like, that was unbelievably

00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:36.740
amazing.

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:39.580
But that is, again, the
experience of manifesting.

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:42.590
He had that insight
years and years ago.

00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:45.820
And yet now, he's
translated that

00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:49.440
into something that offers this
incredibly powerful music that

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:53.230
is both a joy to listen
to, and is also lucrative.

00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:54.280
He's made a lot of money.

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:55.460
He's a very generous guy.

00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:58.470
He's given a lot of
money back as well.

00:41:58.470 --> 00:42:01.360
So that's the experience
of manifestation.

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:07.920
Now if we start to look at
this in terms of mindfulness,

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:13.182
and this is really the essence
of what we call the paramitas.

00:42:13.182 --> 00:42:14.890
And the paramitas,
there are six of them.

00:42:14.890 --> 00:42:17.610
I'm going to get them
in the right order.

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:19.800
The paramitas are
basically the idea

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:21.879
that when we're
working in the world,

00:42:21.879 --> 00:42:23.920
there's six things that
we want to keep track of.

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:25.580
We want to have generosity.

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:26.980
We want to have discipline.

00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:28.370
We want to have patience.

00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:29.760
We want to have exertion.

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:32.290
And we want to have a
practice of meditation,

00:42:32.290 --> 00:42:36.030
whereby we're constantly
refreshing our minds.

00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:38.230
Those are the five
relative paramitas,

00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:40.610
which are the perfections,
the way in which we work out

00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:41.830
in the world.

00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:44.190
But then, capping
all that, is what's

00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:46.290
called the prajna
paramita, which

00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:49.450
is the umbrella of
wisdom, which, again,

00:42:49.450 --> 00:42:54.100
like Joseph Strauss brought into
the world, and also Loren has.

00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:57.070
It's that driving
force that it makes

00:42:57.070 --> 00:43:00.720
you continue to move
forward towards recreating

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:03.340
the experience of insight
that you had initially.

00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:04.920
Does that make sense?

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:06.200
Does that make sense?

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:07.742
So again, those are
the ways in which

00:43:07.742 --> 00:43:09.033
you start to work in the world.

00:43:09.033 --> 00:43:10.780
This is the world
of manifestation.

00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:14.500
And this is the realm, in
terms of Buddhism, which

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:16.560
is the idea of the bodhisattva.

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:18.990
The bodhisattva's
role in the world

00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:24.580
is to keep helping people
understand their own confusion

00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:26.960
and move towards wisdom,
and they keep coming back.

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:29.710
They say, I'm going to
forgo my own enlightenment

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:31.360
until all people
are enlightened.

00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:32.860
That's the realm
of the bodhisattva.

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:34.990
It's a service role.

00:43:34.990 --> 00:43:37.677
So when you're manifesting
creatively, think about,

00:43:37.677 --> 00:43:39.260
how can I bring
things into the world?

00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:41.880
How am I serving
not only the product

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:44.410
or the service that I'm
creating, or the art form,

00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:47.200
but how am I serving
moving through things

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:49.102
in my interactions with people?

00:43:49.102 --> 00:43:50.810
The bigger the project
you have, the more

00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:52.080
you have to collaborate.

00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:54.920
So the more lives you
have in order to touch.

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:57.180
This is also the
seeds of innovation.

00:43:57.180 --> 00:43:58.900
This is where innovation starts.

00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:00.990
In the aha moment,
nothing's happening.

00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:02.860
It's all just experience.

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:06.270
But over here, we actually
start to get into the realm

00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:10.100
of innovation as well.

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:13.730
So just to show how
this starts to work

00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:17.200
in the workplace, this
experience over here,

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:19.400
the number one thing that
we can do, in my opinion,

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:21.860
to promote this sort of
aha moment in the workplace

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:27.210
is just to appreciate people.

00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:30.840
I have a five-year-old that
just started kindergarten.

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:33.690
And it's her second
day of kindergarten.

00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:36.280
She had trouble going to
sleep the night before.

00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:38.220
She woke up late.

00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:43.226
And it takes me about 12 minutes
to get to her school in a car,

00:44:43.226 --> 00:44:45.100
and seven minutes to
get her there on a bike,

00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:46.610
and I love riding my bike.

00:44:46.610 --> 00:44:48.500
But it's kind of a cold morning.

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:50.010
I had her on the
back of the bike.

00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:51.051
I'm riding her to school.

00:44:51.051 --> 00:44:52.820
She's just crying,
I don't want to go,

00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:55.480
and I'm like, oh gosh, you
know, what's going on here?

00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:58.354
And so we get to the school,
and I'm walking her up,

00:44:58.354 --> 00:45:00.520
and she's like no, I don't
want to, I don't want to,

00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:01.180
I don't want to.

00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:03.096
And I bring her up to
the teacher, and I said,

00:45:03.096 --> 00:45:05.500
Sierra's been having really
big emotions right now.

00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:08.567
She's pretty tired.

00:45:08.567 --> 00:45:10.900
And the kindergarten teacher
just went down to her level

00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:13.940
and said, I'm tired, too.

00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:18.117
It takes me about a month to get
used to being back in school.

00:45:18.117 --> 00:45:20.200
Would you mind if your
daddy brought you over here

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:21.830
and read a book together?

00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:25.970
And just like that, she
felt totally at home.

00:45:25.970 --> 00:45:27.720
It was like magic.

00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:28.700
And my heart exploded.

00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:31.220
I'm like, that-- well,
you just got her.

00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:33.930
But that's appreciation.

00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:36.434
And it doesn't have to
do with doing anything.

00:45:36.434 --> 00:45:37.350
There's nothing there.

00:45:37.350 --> 00:45:41.900
Just, she's connecting
with her humanity.

00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:44.380
And then over here in
the manifestation realm,

00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:47.161
if we think about this,
what do you think this?

00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:53.320
This is just acknowledgement.

00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:57.030
especially if you want to
be creative and innovative

00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:58.970
in an organization,
you not only want

00:45:58.970 --> 00:46:03.700
to acknowledge what a
person is doing well,

00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:06.260
but also her attempts
when things don't go well.

00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:08.410
We have to have license
to fail if we're actually

00:46:08.410 --> 00:46:10.250
going to be creative.

00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:13.980
We have to have that
safety by which we

00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:17.360
can start to feel that
we can try things,

00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:20.080
and we won't be reprimanded
if it doesn't go well.

00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:23.110
So this is just acknowledgment,
acknowledgment both for things

00:46:23.110 --> 00:46:26.090
that go right, and also
for efforts that don't.

00:46:26.090 --> 00:46:29.810
As Ed Catmull, the president
of Pixar and Disney animation,

00:46:29.810 --> 00:46:32.060
he would say, our
failures are always

00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:33.890
investments in the future.

00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:37.780
And we encourage people to
fail, not late in the game

00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:39.250
during production, but early.

00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:41.000
You manage for the
failure, because you've

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.040
got to have it if
you want innovation.

00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:44.070
All right?

00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:45.490
So let's come back here.

00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:47.990
So now we're going
back to the vajra spot.

00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:51.900
And again, this is the
space of creative flow.

00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:55.820
And over there, this
is the realm of wisdom,

00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:58.530
primordial knowing before
thought intervenes.

00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:02.970
This is the realm
of compassion, doing

00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:06.250
things in the service
of others, including

00:47:06.250 --> 00:47:09.340
the other part of ourselves,
that higher part of ourselves.

00:47:11.970 --> 00:47:15.070
Now let's go to the
center part here.

00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:21.630
This is what I call
self-expression, self

00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:22.580
expression.

00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:24.550
It's a word we've
all heard, but I

00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:28.850
like to think of it in terms
of the way the Jungians use it,

00:47:28.850 --> 00:47:30.920
and the perennial
philosophers used it.

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:36.910
And the self we're talking about
is the big self, the big self,

00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:39.335
the big self that's connected
to the vibrant world.

00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:45.320
Has anybody ever seen this book?

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:49.270
"Goodnight Moon?"

00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:53.697
So to me, this is a great,
great, great example

00:47:53.697 --> 00:47:56.280
of understanding the two types
of awareness that are happening

00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:57.870
in self-expression.

00:47:57.870 --> 00:48:04.330
If I open the book, "In the
great green room there was

00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:08.590
a telephone and a red balloon
and a picture of"-- full

00:48:08.590 --> 00:48:15.560
color-- "the cow
jumping over the moon."

00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:19.540
So this-- we go
to this next page.

00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:21.120
This is the realm of self.

00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:23.930
This is what they would
call the divine ground.

00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:27.720
It's the vibrant sense of
a dynamic, interdependent,

00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:29.500
mysterious world.

00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:32.800
And yet throughout
the book, the person

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:37.150
keeps focusing in on
things, individual objects.

00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:39.220
In order to create,
we need both.

00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:43.450
We need to be able to have those
big, great green room moments.

00:48:43.450 --> 00:48:47.812
We also need to be able to
focus on specific tasks.

00:48:47.812 --> 00:48:49.520
So in Buddhism they
would talk about that

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:53.130
as the two truths, the
absolute truth, which

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:56.220
is the great green room,
and the relative truth,

00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:59.400
which is our ability
to understand where

00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:02.100
we stop and the world
begins, what we're good at,

00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:04.540
what we're not good at, what
our bank accounts are doing,

00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:06.360
what things are happening time.

00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:09.577
Those two things both need
to be honored in there.

00:49:09.577 --> 00:49:10.910
But we're in the middle of this.

00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:13.330
When we're in the
vajra spot again,

00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:15.550
in this place of
self-expression,

00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:18.010
we're doing both
at the same time.

00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:22.510
We're maintaining the sort
of awareness that is here,

00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:25.960
this big awareness, this
connectedness, this aliveness

00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:29.740
that's always there,
while simultaneously we're

00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:34.840
making discrete decisions,
taking discrete actions,

00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:39.470
following tasks, anticipating
outcomes, working with others,

00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:42.290
having one conversation
after the next.

00:49:42.290 --> 00:49:44.545
And this is the space
of creative flow.

00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:52.800
And this is the place of
aliveness in our lives.

00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:56.975
So the question is, how do we
cultivate this in the workplace

00:49:56.975 --> 00:49:58.240
and in our lives?

00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:00.520
What are the main things
that we need to do here

00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:03.130
in order to cultivate that?

00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:07.940
And the main thing
here is that we

00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:12.440
help people to establish
their mission and vision,

00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:13.895
and also to hone their craft.

00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:20.280
So the United States
is amazing, because we

00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:22.810
have people from all over
the world who come here,

00:50:22.810 --> 00:50:25.999
and they leave traditions
from other places, right?

00:50:25.999 --> 00:50:27.040
That's the amazing thing.

00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:30.080
That's why this is one of the
most creative and innovative

00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:31.710
places in the world,
because everybody

00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:34.280
leaves their traditions
and comes here.

00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:35.930
But the confusion
about being here

00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:38.220
is that we don't have an
overarching narrative of what

00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:39.570
our lives are about.

00:50:39.570 --> 00:50:42.260
And that's actually
really hard on us,

00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:44.050
if we don't identify
what it is it

00:50:44.050 --> 00:50:47.350
we're actively working
on in the big sphere

00:50:47.350 --> 00:50:49.730
of what our lives are about.

00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:52.160
So creating a vision,
a sense of where

00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:56.790
you're going in your life,
and creating a mission

00:50:56.790 --> 00:51:00.070
starts to bring in
this need for meaning.

00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:03.230
We all have this intense
need for meaning.

00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:05.940
No other creature
quite has that thing.

00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:07.450
But yet we are the
ones-- you know,

00:51:07.450 --> 00:51:09.950
we have to understand our lives.

00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:11.160
So that's the first thing.

00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:14.810
And when we start to
create that meaning,

00:51:14.810 --> 00:51:19.504
it allows our lives to,
again, have direction.

00:51:19.504 --> 00:51:20.920
The distractions
that come up-- we

00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:21.812
go, oh, that's a
good distraction,

00:51:21.812 --> 00:51:23.186
so I should go in
that direction.

00:51:23.186 --> 00:51:25.674
But that has nothing-- or,
here's another thing that's

00:51:25.674 --> 00:51:27.090
coming at me, but
that's not going

00:51:27.090 --> 00:51:28.540
to get me where I want to go.

00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:31.110
And suddenly, all the
choices that we have,

00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:32.110
they start to fall away.

00:51:32.110 --> 00:51:35.660
And you start to feel called
in your vocation, what

00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:39.310
it is you're here to
do, to offer the world.

00:51:39.310 --> 00:51:43.140
And everybody is being called
to do something in the world.

00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:44.490
You have to define it.

00:51:44.490 --> 00:51:49.020
My mission in life is to
empower others as creators.

00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:50.200
That's my mission.

00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:52.960
And that's how I think and
view the world all the time.

00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:54.542
How can I empower people?

00:51:54.542 --> 00:51:57.000
I work with a team of designers
and an architectural design

00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:57.500
firm.

00:51:57.500 --> 00:51:59.280
How can we work
together in order

00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:04.380
to create this structure
for this person?

00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:07.156
How can we empower
the clients to give us

00:52:07.156 --> 00:52:08.530
their deepest
beliefs and values,

00:52:08.530 --> 00:52:11.640
and how are we going
to design from that?

00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:14.400
I'm constantly, in every
interaction with my kids,

00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:18.270
with my wife, how can I
empower them as creators?

00:52:18.270 --> 00:52:20.330
How can I be the
person that does that?

00:52:20.330 --> 00:52:23.515
So that's, again, establishing
your mission and your vision.

00:52:23.515 --> 00:52:25.515
The other thing, I think,
is to hone your craft.

00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:31.480
Humans love doing
what they're good at.

00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:33.500
There's a guy named
Johnson O'Connor, who

00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:40.630
was a guy from General Electric
who had basically recognized

00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:45.700
early in the last century
that-- it seems obvious now--

00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:49.250
but people are happiest doing
things that they're good at.

00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:53.170
And they love building
upon those skills as well.

00:52:53.170 --> 00:52:56.730
So in a work situation, we
want to figure out, again,

00:52:56.730 --> 00:52:57.690
what is our sweet spot?

00:52:57.690 --> 00:52:58.400
What are we good at?

00:52:58.400 --> 00:52:59.800
Where does our magic come from?

00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:01.170
And focus on that.

00:53:01.170 --> 00:53:04.470
And then also look at how we can
intersect with other people who

00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:08.830
have opposite talents,
or different things, can

00:53:08.830 --> 00:53:10.290
so we can help one another.

00:53:10.290 --> 00:53:12.610
That's the joy of collaboration.

00:53:12.610 --> 00:53:15.060
That's the joy of
working with one another.

00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:17.110
And this space, again,
this is the arhat,

00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:19.970
the one that wants to leave
and go into the bigness.

00:53:19.970 --> 00:53:21.640
This is the
bodhisattva, one who's

00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:25.020
actually working in the world
but maintaining that awareness.

00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:28.590
This is what we would call the
tantrica, again, the person

00:53:28.590 --> 00:53:32.600
that, in every interaction,
is weaving wakefulness

00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:36.530
into every experience
as much as possible.

00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:40.980
And the difference between this
space and the other two spaces?

00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:45.910
This space and that space still
have a residue of confusion.

00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:48.920
Like, I'm a confused person.

00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:50.290
I'm confused.

00:53:50.290 --> 00:53:52.160
I don't know exactly what to do.

00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:55.200
I'm wanting to move out of
my confusion towards wisdom.

00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:57.390
When we step into
self-expression

00:53:57.390 --> 00:54:02.780
and we own our
creativity, then we're

00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:09.920
in the space of basically
being fully human.

00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:17.940
We are saying, my basic nature
is wakefulness, not confusion.

00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:20.954
My basic nature is wakefulness.

00:54:20.954 --> 00:54:23.245
And that's what you feel when
you're in the flow state,

00:54:23.245 --> 00:54:28.030
that your basic
nature is to be awake.

00:54:28.030 --> 00:54:30.260
And that's what the
mindfulness practice is,

00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:34.250
and that's also what
creativity has to offer.

00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:37.940
So I know that we went
over a lot of information.

00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:43.590
I just want to offer you this
as a way of understanding

00:54:43.590 --> 00:54:45.350
all the information
that we talked about.

00:54:45.350 --> 00:54:51.330
Again, like I said, I love
making maps of creativity,

00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:53.410
spirituality.

00:54:53.410 --> 00:54:56.280
"The Shoreline of
Wonder" is a dharma book,

00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:58.770
but it's geared toward
the secular audience.

00:54:58.770 --> 00:55:00.450
My languaging is
always towards, how

00:55:00.450 --> 00:55:03.210
can I intersect the people
that need this the most?

00:55:03.210 --> 00:55:05.520
And in my opinion,
it's the ones who

00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:09.900
maybe don't want to go
into the mystery, who

00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:14.450
want to ignore dynamism
and interdependence, who

00:55:14.450 --> 00:55:15.910
want to fixate on
their life, you

00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:17.960
want to retire by a
certain time in their life

00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:19.790
and kind of cruise.

00:55:19.790 --> 00:55:21.690
This is targeting that.

00:55:21.690 --> 00:55:25.070
And in the workplace,
all these ideas

00:55:25.070 --> 00:55:28.024
here-- again, the ground,
which is in gray, and then

00:55:28.024 --> 00:55:30.440
the other ones-- the connection,
the making the difference

00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:33.200
and meaning-- those are the
basic needs of being human,

00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:36.840
which is accomplished through
appreciation, acknowledgment,

00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:41.060
and empowerment, empowering
others as creators.

00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:43.220
And here's a little bit
of a close-up of that

00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:46.150
just so you can see
it a little better.

00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:48.380
And if you would like a
copy of this yourself,

00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:51.940
you go to my website and
you can find it there.

00:55:51.940 --> 00:55:55.380
If you go to AustinHillShaw.com,
you can find that.

00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:58.700
And there's a whole explanation
on the back whereby you'll

00:55:58.700 --> 00:56:01.410
get all the information
that we talked about here

00:56:01.410 --> 00:56:02.850
just a moment ago.

00:56:02.850 --> 00:56:06.930
So I know that we're coming
up really quickly on time.

00:56:06.930 --> 00:56:09.460
I don't know if you have
a moment for one or two

00:56:09.460 --> 00:56:11.470
questions.

00:56:11.470 --> 00:56:15.590
But thank you so much.

00:56:15.590 --> 00:56:18.290
AUDIENCE: Thanks so
much for the talk.

00:56:18.290 --> 00:56:21.670
I have a question
about-- so bringing this

00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:25.900
into the workplace, where you
mentioned getting to a flow

00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:29.580
state, and a relationship
with that between-- how

00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:32.590
is that necessarily related
to something that is actually

00:56:32.590 --> 00:56:34.190
beneficial in a larger sense?

00:56:37.170 --> 00:56:39.320
A company that makes
cluster bombs that

00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:44.060
wants to function with less
dysfunction in the workplace,

00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:45.680
as one example.

00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:48.690
AUSTIN HILL SHAW: That's
a fantastic question.

00:56:48.690 --> 00:56:52.050
The question, again, is how-- if
we're entering the flow states,

00:56:52.050 --> 00:56:52.950
that's great.

00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:56.050
But what if our outlook is to
build a better bomb, a more

00:56:56.050 --> 00:56:57.980
destructive element?

00:56:57.980 --> 00:57:00.900
So, you know, how to say.

00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:02.870
I love humanity.

00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:05.200
And when I'm working
with individuals,

00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:07.500
what I've recognized
through the years is,

00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:09.400
people want to
love and be loved.

00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:10.767
But hurt people hurt people.

00:57:10.767 --> 00:57:12.100
That comes in the prison system.

00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:16.330
The meanest person in
the yard is the one that

00:57:16.330 --> 00:57:18.530
has been hurt the most, right?

00:57:18.530 --> 00:57:20.650
So you're right.

00:57:20.650 --> 00:57:23.210
A flow state can be
used destructively.

00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:26.370
But the beauty of a flow state,
when it's working actively,

00:57:26.370 --> 00:57:31.470
is it brings forth what
I call transmutation.

00:57:31.470 --> 00:57:33.340
Transmutation is
basically moving--

00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:35.830
it's almost like alchemical,
bringing a base substance

00:57:35.830 --> 00:57:37.430
and making it elevated.

00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:40.950
But in human beings, it means
taking all those hurts become

00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:43.300
bottled up in the
ways we shut away,

00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:45.560
turn away from our
natural creativity

00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:47.050
into addictive patterns.

00:57:47.050 --> 00:57:48.740
We face those
patterns and we step

00:57:48.740 --> 00:57:51.320
back in through the
process of transmutation.

00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:53.760
So one of the highest
expressions of creativity,

00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:56.870
in my opinion, is healing.

00:57:56.870 --> 00:58:01.540
And so we can't
make people change.

00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:03.950
But we can demonstrate,
through own insights,

00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:06.190
our own manifestation, and
our own self-expression,

00:58:06.190 --> 00:58:08.430
a different path
of doing things.

00:58:08.430 --> 00:58:10.250
You can't force
anybody to do anything.

00:58:10.250 --> 00:58:13.070
But you can surround
them with love

00:58:13.070 --> 00:58:15.460
and not make them
wrong for that.

00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:18.880
At the essence, this
is a path of love.

00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:21.180
And there's things that look
like self-expression which

00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:23.894
are actually, in Buddha dharma,
they would call egohood,

00:58:23.894 --> 00:58:25.810
which, you're actually--
you think that you're

00:58:25.810 --> 00:58:27.476
moving towards
enlightenment, but you're

00:58:27.476 --> 00:58:30.580
moving towards-- it's
almost like megamaniacal.

00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:32.352
So great question.

00:58:32.352 --> 00:58:33.810
AUDIENCE: In the
workspace, I would

00:58:33.810 --> 00:58:35.690
notice that a lot of
people are working

00:58:35.690 --> 00:58:38.750
from this egomaniacal space.

00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:40.300
They're working
for self-interest.

00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:41.799
They're working to
try to get ahead.

00:58:41.799 --> 00:58:44.420
They're working to try to
make a name for themselves.

00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:47.700
How does one who is trying
to work from a deeper

00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:51.590
place, trying to
express big self,

00:58:51.590 --> 00:58:54.300
do that amongst all
these other influences?

00:58:56.970 --> 00:59:00.865
AUSTIN HILL SHAW: Well,
I think that-- one

00:59:00.865 --> 00:59:02.240
of the ways of
understanding this

00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:04.850
is that I think that,
again, none of us

00:59:04.850 --> 00:59:06.540
go through our
childhood unscathed.

00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:08.560
None of us come into
the world unscathed.

00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:11.780
We have the imprints of
our maternal lineage,

00:59:11.780 --> 00:59:12.910
our paternal lineage.

00:59:12.910 --> 00:59:17.080
And I also think that when
consciousness comes in,

00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:20.410
there's other elements that
are probably not even our own.

00:59:20.410 --> 00:59:22.480
They're things that are
being passed down to us

00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:24.790
that we are here to work on.

00:59:24.790 --> 00:59:28.680
And my understanding is,
basically, our core wound, what

00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:30.560
hurts us the most--
for me, it was

00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:35.060
feeling disconnected-- starts
to become your vocation.

00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:38.590
So if you sit with that feeling
of what's not working for you

00:59:38.590 --> 00:59:41.810
and be curious about
it, that's what

00:59:41.810 --> 00:59:44.590
evolves into what your vocation,
the thing you're offering.

00:59:44.590 --> 00:59:46.850
So for example, here, in the
realm of the bodhisattva,

00:59:46.850 --> 00:59:50.550
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH], is
shown with thousands of eyes.

00:59:50.550 --> 00:59:54.050
And those eyes are to look out
at the suffering of the world,

00:59:54.050 --> 00:59:55.930
to understand the
suffering of the world.

00:59:55.930 --> 00:59:59.640
When you're here, the word
is basically, make your world

00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:02.120
a seeming paradise
while you feel

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:04.560
the pain of habitual patterns.

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:06.850
This is the place
of sad joy, which

01:00:06.850 --> 01:00:10.410
is actually an amazing,
amazing place to be.

01:00:10.410 --> 01:00:13.720
The movie "Inside Out" explores
the theme of sadness and joy

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:14.410
together.

01:00:14.410 --> 01:00:17.720
It leads for a richer life, even
though typically, we're like,

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:20.460
I want more joy, don't
want more sadness.

01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:23.380
I just read last
night an article

01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:25.720
on the geography of sorrow.

01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:29.930
This person asked this African
woman, why are you so joyous?

01:00:29.930 --> 01:00:32.950
She said, because I cry so much.

01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:36.730
I cry so much.

01:00:36.730 --> 01:00:41.340
Our joy is accelerated
and amplified

01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:45.330
by the more that we can go
in our sorrow, our hurt, all

01:00:45.330 --> 01:00:46.530
those things.

01:00:46.530 --> 01:00:50.245
And in the workplace,
that's the conversation

01:00:50.245 --> 01:00:52.290
we're going to
start to get into.

01:00:52.290 --> 01:00:56.000
We don't want to say,
here's my work persona.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.420
We want to bring all of you.

01:00:57.420 --> 01:00:58.732
We're better off that way.

01:00:58.732 --> 01:01:00.190
And how we manage
that, well, we're

01:01:00.190 --> 01:01:01.773
all still figuring
that out right now,

01:01:01.773 --> 01:01:04.932
how we can be fully
human everywhere.

01:01:04.932 --> 01:01:06.140
VAN RIPER: Thank you, Austin.

01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:07.990
AUSTIN HILL SHAW: Thank you.
