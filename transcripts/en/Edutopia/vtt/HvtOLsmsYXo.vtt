00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.630
- Up until recently, people worked

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.130
on their own in their rooms.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.040
I mean curriculum development
was something we did

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.360
with maybe a colleague or two.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.453
Maybe someone you went to
your credential program with.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.097
- We engendered this
sense that this curriculum

00:00:23.097 --> 00:00:26.270
was going to be owned by our teachers

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.003
rather than purchased for them.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.560
- That conversation helping figure out

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.470
if they actually misunderstood it

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.110
or if they just answered wrong, you know?

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.510
- Like if they're just not
using the right terminology,

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.280
and their understanding is correct

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.910
but they're not talking
about it the right way.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.060
- Ongoing professional
development is coming from

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.680
the communities of teachers
at Science collaborating,

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.700
making decisions about their own practice.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.520
Teachers that are using the
curriculum all come together

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.070
able to share student work.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.080
- If you look at all of
these, they're the same.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.220
I mean these are a little more spread out,

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.640
but they're pretty much the same.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.210
But her explanation on it shows

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.390
that she's at least understanding
that there's a difference

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.370
between three things.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.790
- [Eric Lewis] They are able
to share some of their concerns

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.430
and questions about the curriculum,

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.630
but also do a lot of learning together.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.140
- I wanted them to understand
that hot air is less dense.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.850
I wanted them to actually see,
or at least in the explorer,

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.410
that hot air was less dense.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.020
- They're able to make comments.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.930
They're able to put something
into a discussion board.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.160
They're able to share
some of the adaptations

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.990
that they've made that might take us

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.200
into a different direction.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.470
We get to get our voices heard and you get

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.980
to really share information
and as a teacher,

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.060
really you want to share information.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.060
- To have somebody who has been involved

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.770
in the development of the curriculum,

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.900
and that same person takes it
back to their own classroom

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.720
and tries it out, you
get really deep insight.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.770
- We get to help the
curriculum along as we do it.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.520
Collaboration days that we get to come to

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.070
are actually really beneficial.
