Speaker 1:          00:00          It's cool stuff. You'd love it. I'm fascinated by wolves. I think wolves to me are probably the most interesting animal in the wild.

Speaker 2:          00:08          Can't candidates man, while dogs of all kind are unbelievable. They're so at the top of their respective food chain.

Speaker 1:          00:16          Yeah. We have a, a lot of coyotes around here and basically they're little wolves, the little sneaky wolves, but a real wolves like wolves in Yellowstone wolves in the northwest area of the United States. Though there they have got to be some of the most majestic animals cause hastick they are there, they operate together always yes. To these packs. Yep. You know, so there's some sort of weird kind of communication and,

Speaker 2:          00:42          and, and what's amazing is like the social dynamic, like within the pack, you know, the hierarchy and then on a hunt like you go left, I go right. But without any verbal communication, right. And then coming together and making a killer. I mean it's mind blowing stuff. You know, you talk about not understanding wildlife, we don't understand how they do that.

Speaker 1:          00:59          Right, right. We don't understand what kind of communications going on. Do you think there's some sort of like telepathic or is it just a facial recognition? Recognizing cues and patterns that they've established before of they see an animal, they note a flank it.

Speaker 2:          01:14          I definitely believe it's that. Like I definitely believe there is an intrinsic understanding of you go left, I go right. You know, facial recognition, you know, your, your expression tells me to do something your dominant. I'm, I'm passive, you know, learning that way. But I also think there's something more than that. Whether it's telepathic, whether it's a low frequency sound that we're, it's not audible to us. I have no idea. But I do think it's more than just visual cues. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:40          That's where the, apparently the myth of the Werewolf comes from is that wolves are so smart. They think that wolf and a person, we're like combined together.

Speaker 2:          01:51          I don't believe that per se, but I can see how that came up. You know what I mean? It's totally, there's so smart. African wild dogs are the same. Like they, they hunt in these huge packs. They go over these massive areas and then they'll push a single animal into one area to make the kill. And they're not big animals there. Again, like a coyote size, and they'll take down, you know, a kudu or some huge antelope. I mean, it's, it's incredible.

Speaker 1:          02:12          Well, African wild dogs are so cool looking to, with those black spots or yellow and all the stunning, they just, they look angry.

Speaker 2:          02:20          Yeah. Okay. You know, there's, I think they're, they're my favorite of the key. Like you love wolves. I love African wild dogs. I just think they're so beautiful and majestic and unusual and they're just such a cool animal. Correct

Speaker 1:          02:32          me if I'm wrong, but I think all of them come from the United States. I think all of them originally came from North America. Like I think [inaudible]. Yeah. All candidates came from North America. I think that's Coyote America. The gentleman who had been on the podcast before, what is his name, is escaping me right now. Uh, but he, he wrote about it. Huh? About, you know, all the various jackals and Flores. Dan Flores. That's it. He's, that is fascinating book. Yeah. I'm going to write it down. Yeah, I'd love to read it. Great. And I did a podcast with him, uh, years ago. That's excellent too. And he has all sorts of crazy insight as to native American, North American animals that went somewhere else, like a horses, like horses were native to North America, but they weren't here when the European settlers came. They had, they went extinct, but they had been taken. They had the, there were other places, like apparently wild horses from Europe, all originated from North America and we're taking over and then another wow from whatever. And then when extinct here and then were reintroduced with the European settlers. Huh. That's interesting. Crazy. Yeah. And

Speaker 2:          03:41          that's the thing, like with what I do looking for extinct animals are proof that they're still out there is like, there are so many stories like that. I didn't know that one in specific, America's very well covered with eyeballs. But what's to say there isn't some remnant small population somewhere in the middle of nowhere that nobody has found these horses that have been untouched by human beings for millennia. Right. And that's, that's what I, that's what I do. That's what drives me. Right? Find this pocket, find this animal that's been hiding out undetected for thousands of years.
