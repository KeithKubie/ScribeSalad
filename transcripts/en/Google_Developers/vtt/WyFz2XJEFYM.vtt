00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:02.860
Have you ever wondered
how some developers

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.950
build a great product and
business on Google Play?

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.850
My name is Serge Kassardjian.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.680
I work on the Google Play team.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.060
My focus is on apps and games
for our Android ecosystem.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.680
I'm going to tell you how to
create a successful app in Play

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.750
and leverage unique
Android features to do so.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.620
My team works with our partners
to build great experiences

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.110
for Android that get
their content distributed

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.560
to our large install base of
Android users around the world.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.130
We want your business and brand
to succeed on Google Play.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.250
So what will you learn here?

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.360
I will show you how to create
a successful app in Play

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.390
and leverage unique
Android features to do so.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.960
There are a lot of great
ways to unlock value

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.350
and succeed as an
Android developer.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.110
And I will help you
get started doing so.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.540
I'm going to show you
how and why to do this,

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.570
demonstrating its importance
to your brand and business.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.800
I'll also show you some
interesting Android related

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.010
facts as well product features
you may not be aware of.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.510
Google Play is a great
place to grow your business,

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.480
especially if you
do it the right way.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.770
The platform is
growing very quickly

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.160
as is our engaged
audience interacting

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.640
with the apps and
games in the store.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.260
We currently have over
50 billion downloads,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.940
with over 2 billion
downloads coming every month,

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.080
and we've paid out more than
4x as much money to developers

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.110
in 2013 as we did
compared to 2012.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.340
Play also provides a unique
iterative environment

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.810
for our developers that
allows them to A/B test

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.570
using such features as
alpha and beta testing

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.290
and staged roll outs.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.520
Further, developers can take
advantage of other form factors

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.220
that will drive engagement
through new channels

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.280
and touch points such as
tablets, wearables, and others.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.390
This is an awesome way to drive
new use cases for your app that

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.270
previously were
not available when

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.220
you were on smartphones only.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.740
Play will not only allow you to
leverage our gigantic audience,

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.830
but also take advantage
of new functionality

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.800
using your content.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.180
We are living in an
increasingly global world,

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.090
and every business and app is
becoming an international one.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.990
What is your strategy
across the globe?

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.820
Google Play and Android
is an opportunity

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.060
to unlock this through our
distribution and strengths

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.940
in various markets that are
large and growing quickly

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.800
as you can see here.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.650
Partners such as
JackThreads and Noom

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.950
all use tools to grow
international numbers.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.990
In fact, 2/3 of
all Play purchases

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.420
actually happen internationally.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.390
And we strongly
encourage our developers

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.012
to take advantage of this.

00:02:48.012 --> 00:02:50.310
This large
international community

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.430
includes 200 plus countries
that can download from the Play

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.800
store at 130 plus buyer markets.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.380
To take advantage of
this big opportunity,

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.780
use our tools for
internationalization

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.280
and language translation to
help make shifting from country

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.110
to country and language
to language very easy.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.750
Users will feel a lot
more attached to your app

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.520
if it feels familiar
and not so foreign.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.600
Further, identify
countries that you are not

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.300
in that are potentially great
markets for Android and Play.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.545
You can see unexpected
spikes of traffic

00:03:25.545 --> 00:03:28.320
in countries that
you've activated,

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.030
and start focusing on
those markets, which

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.760
coincide with the big
markets for Android and Play.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.430
The next thing to
look at is design.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.480
I can't express the importance
of good visual design

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.110
and interaction patterns.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.590
Design, design, design.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.150
Make a strong Android Design.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.180
It changes everything.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.230
People love great looking apps.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.470
It's your extension
of your brand.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.360
Pure Android Design makes you
speak to the audience in a way

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.060
that they are used to
interacting with their device.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.070
It will improve conversion
and bring your right content

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.410
to the front.

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.890
Great Design apps are
great performing apps.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.530
So why and how does Design help?

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.500
Well, quality wins every time.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.690
Our researchers have
shown that users

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.690
are willing to pay more
for better quality.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.030
By using our Android
Design guidelines,

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.420
such as our standard action
bar, drawer, and tabs,

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.170
you can create an
environment that people

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.080
will spend more
and feel like it's

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.680
the primary channel
for your content.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.160
As you can see here, as
your star rating improves,

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.930
so does consumer's
willingness to pay.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.720
We see a dramatic increase
in monetization per user

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.260
as ratings move from
one to five stars.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.930
Further, tablet optimization
emphasizes sizes quality

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.970
and purchases.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.150
Compared to phones, we've
seen a 1.7 next purchase

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.960
rate on tablets.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.050
Also, we continue to
make it much easier

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.210
for your customers to pay as we
increase our forms of payment.

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.810
For example, direct
carrier billing

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.250
is now available for
over 50% of Play users.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.310
And don't forget, you can
respond to all your reviewers.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.310
Talk to your audience to get
your ratings up and improve

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.400
your app.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.770
As your audience sees
you interacting with them

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.960
and invested in
their needs, they'll

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.340
provide valuable
feedback and consider

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.680
changing their review
based on your changes.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.770
Not only does this help
you improve your app,

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.130
but ultimately helps
improve the community

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.110
of interacting around your
app and their feelings

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.680
towards your company.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.200
And don't forget--
sizing correctly

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.840
makes a big difference.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.280
The smaller your app,
the less likely people

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.310
will uninstall it,
and more likely

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:51.840
they will to download it.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.660
People look for this stuff.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.760
They don't want apps
that eat up their memory

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.630
and drain their battery.

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.912
There are ways to
reduce these uninstalls.

00:05:59.912 --> 00:06:02.330
Uninstalls will
ultimately hurt you

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.840
in how you appear in the
charts and search in the store.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.650
Always try to avoid
these uninstalls.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.630
And don't forget,
take advantage of all

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:16.700
of our fun, unique Android
features and best practices.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.680
Standout icons catch
everyone's attention,

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.470
and Android icons
have a distinct style

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.240
that our users look for.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.210
The app should be a silhouette
on a clear background

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.800
at a high definition, XXHDP.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.590
Make sure yours is
optimized for devices

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.990
and is an effective
identifier of your app.

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.850
Make a great Play listing
that is very accurate

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.360
and includes screenshots
of both phone and tablets

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.600
as well as creating a great
video for this listing.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.620
When you are marketing your
app, create a Google Play badge

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.020
on your materials
and deep link it

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.520
to your Play store
listing so your users can

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.370
find your app easily.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:59.800
And finally, don't forget to
have some fun with your app

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.170
and engage your consumers in
new and exciting ways using

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:06.520
dynamic notifications,
live wallpapers,

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.079
and creative widgets.

00:07:09.079 --> 00:07:10.870
Thank you for taking
the time to learn more

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:13.670
about some of the best
practices for apps and games

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:14.740
on Google Play.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.660
We are excited to see the
new version of your app.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.600
My name is Serge, and
I'm looking forward

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.600
to working with some
great app developers.
