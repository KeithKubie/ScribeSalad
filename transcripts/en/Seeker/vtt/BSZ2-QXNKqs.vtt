00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:17.779
Japanese scientists have recently successfully
turned mice translucent.

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.130
Hi there viewers, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.190
Translucent animals are more common than you
probably think, in that they actually already

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.190
exist.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.450
Most of the naturally occurring ones are found
in the deep ocean.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.410
There’s so little light that reflecting
any that does reach that far down can make

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.160
them a tasty piece of deep sea horror sushi.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.930
So a lot of deep sea critters are see-through
to avoid that.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.980
You might notice a lot of them are red or
a transparent pink too, because red light’s

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.030
long wavelength means it has low energy and
doesn’t penetrate water well.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.710
Thus animals that only reflect red light are
essentially invisible down there.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:48.829
Isn’t science neat?

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.329
Up here there’s not much point in having
transparent skin.

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.489
There’s so much light that being a gooey
see-through blob of floating bones and organs

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.911
is going to be a bit more noticeable than
being the same color as your surrounds, so

00:00:59.911 --> 00:01:01.989
it doesn’t really make sense.

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.150
Of course scientists aren’t hampered by
your precious “logic” and have bred a

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.850
few frogs and goldfish to have see through
skin.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.740
Researchers in Japan took the most pale ones
they could find and kept breeding them together.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.950
The goal is to be able to observe the internal
organs while the animal is alive, making it

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.540
easier to keep track of tumor growth and how
they react to chemicals.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.380
This for me raises an important philosophical
question.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.920
No it’s not, “should scientists play god?”

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.020
I want to know what you call a see through
goldfish.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.850
But now there’s a way to turn the skin,
brain, lungs, the whole shebang except the

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.149
bones clear.

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:38.539
A team at the RIKEN quantitative biology center
in Osaka pulled off the trick on mice by flushing

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:42.469
out their circulatory systems with saline
and then pumping a chemical through them for

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:43.469
2 weeks.

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:45.259
The chemical removes heme from the mice.

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.700
Heme is found in most tissue and is the “heme”
part of hemoglobin, it’s the compound in

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.899
blood that binds to oxygen and also gives
it its red tint.

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.719
Fun fact: your blood is always red, regardless
of whether or not it has oxygen.

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.750
Remember what I said about red light not being
able to penetrate well because of it’s low

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.750
energy?

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.399
That’s why your veins look blue under your
skin.

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:09.070
Totally transparent mice make it possible
to see the cellular networks inside tissue.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.030
Hiroki Ueda, who led the team, hopes it can
be used to gain a better understanding of

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.670
cancer or autoimmune diseases by being able
to observe how they develop without having

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.989
to dissect the mice.

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.459
As it so often goes though, the mice don’t
get off easy.

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.810
Being stripped of blood and then heme entirely
is pretty much game over.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.510
But I for one am resting easier knowing that
there’s no nightmare fuel jell-o mice running

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.650
around with the chance to escape and breed
and form an invisible army of horror and cheese

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:36.650
theft.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.209
If you want to learn another way to turn yourself
invisible while keeping all your blood in

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.790
you, Amy’s got a video on that over here.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.790
If you’ve got a story of a time science
did something awesome for lab mice, I want

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:47.939
to hear about it in the comments.

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:51.319
I’m not a vegetarian or anything, but I
can only read so many stories about lab mice

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:52.600
before I need a pick me up.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:03:05.250
Until then, I’ll see you next time on DNews.
