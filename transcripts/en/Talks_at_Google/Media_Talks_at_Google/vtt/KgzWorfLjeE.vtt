[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.988 --> 00:00:08.982
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:12.552 --> 00:00:14.510
SPEAKER: Ron, it's a
pleasure to have you here.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:15.426
RON GILBERT: And here.

00:00:15.426 --> 00:00:18.600
SPEAKER: So we won't have
time to talk about the movie--

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.925
the movie "Park."

00:00:19.925 --> 00:00:23.990
You joined Lucas Arts
more than 30 years ago,

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.380
so I would like to talk
a bit about that as well.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.010
RON GILBERT: It was
a long time ago.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.510
SPEAKER: Can you take us back?

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.955
How did you-- how did you
get the job at LucasArts--

00:00:34.955 --> 00:00:36.570
Lucasfilm Games back then?

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.160
SPEAKER: Getting the job was
actually a lot of random luck.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.230
I was in college
at the time, and I

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.260
built this program called
Graphics BASIC, which

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.760
was this little BASIC extension
language for the Commodore 64.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.550
And I'd sold it, you know,
the publishing rights

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.750
to this company in California.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.310
And after they kind of-- we
signed that deal, they said,

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.840
hey do you want a job?

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.840
So I thought, OK,
well that sounds fine.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.430
So I quit college,
and I loaded up my car

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.980
and I drove to California,
because I was living in Oregon

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.060
at the time.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.010
And I went to work for
them, and maybe six months

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.470
after I started the
company went bankrupt.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.110
So that was my
first introduction

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.180
to the games business--

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.620
my company going bankrupt.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.550
And so I packed up my car,
and I moved back to Oregon.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.440
And I was going to
enroll back in college

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.350
and all that kind of stuff.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.310
And I was, like, literally
I was in my parents' kitchen

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.210
and I was about to head
up to the University

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.980
and have lunch with a friend.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.220
And it's like I walked out
the door and the phone rang.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.125
And I'm like, oh,
I really don't want

00:01:48.125 --> 00:01:49.250
to go back and answer that.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.220
And I started to head more
out and the phone kept ringing

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.252
and I finally I'm, fine,
I'll final answer it.

00:01:54.252 --> 00:01:56.210
And I just went back in
and answered the phone.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.610
It was somebody from
Lucasfilm, because they

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.950
were looking for a Commodore
64 programmer, which

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.840
was what I had done at
the previous company.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.580
And I guess they
had heard about me

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.230
from someone that worked there.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.310
And I thought, wow, Lucasfilm!

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.410
And I had no idea
the made games.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.720
To me, Lucasfilm was Star
Wars and Indiana Jones,

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.640
and I had no idea
they made games.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.260
And so it's like,
wow, Lucasfilm!

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.110
So I packed up my car and
I drove back to California.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.380
And I mean, I haven't even
gotten the job interview,

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.880
right?

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.990
I just moved back to California
because I was getting that job.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.480
There was no way I was
not getting that job.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.895
So I got the job.

00:02:34.895 --> 00:02:39.740
SPEAKER: So the gaming branch
of Lucasfilm was very new.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.580
While the Lucasfilm name
was very big, of course.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.660
And can you take us back?

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.390
How was working there
in the early days?

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.000
Because I think you had
this fancy Skywalker Ranch

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.420
while you were working there?

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.836
RON GILBERT: When
I first started,

00:02:52.836 --> 00:02:55.400
we were in this kind of
industrial complex called

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.490
Kerner.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.630
And it's where Industrial Light
and Magic was, because they

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:00.950
had a lot of warehouses.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.870
Because they were constantly
blowing stuff up all the time.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.730
So we were kind of
down, down with them.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.460
And we were there for, I guess
about a year and a half maybe.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.260
Maybe two years.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.870
I can't quite remember.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.780
But when I started,
there were seven people

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.210
in the Lucasfilm games group.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.710
You know it was a very, very,
very small group of people.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.120
But it was just an amazingly
creative group of people.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.790
It's like, I don't think
in my life I had ever

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.670
been around smarter people,
you know, than those people.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.962
And it was kind of
this weird experience.

00:03:30.962 --> 00:03:31.670
And it was just--

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.310
I mean, it was absolutely
wonderful to be there.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.590
And, you know, I was 11 years
old when Star Wars came out,

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.090
right?

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.140
And that was like the perfect
age to be a Star Wars fan.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.920
And so, I mean, to me, you
know Lucasfilm was just

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.670
this like amazing thing.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.610
And George Lucas was like
my hero, and all this stuff.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.100
And then to be working
there, you know,

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.145
it's just mind boggling.

00:03:55.145 --> 00:04:00.560
SPEAKER: I think you are one
of the very few game developers

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.080
who do both the coding bit,
but also the creative bits.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.320
How did this come about?

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.780
Did they ask you to do both?

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.260
Or did you bring that and
that was your advantage?

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.269
RON GILBERT: In the early
days of the game business,

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.140
I think you really
had to do both.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.839
I mean, people were building
games completely on their own.

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:24.950
And so, you know, you did
art and you did programming

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:25.940
and you did design.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.050
And you did, you know, all
this stuff in those early days.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.330
And I was hired at Lucasfilm
to be a programmer,

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.790
to do Commodore 64 work.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.190
And it was there that
that I met Gary Winnick,

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.610
and he was an artist.

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.630
He was actually the only artist
in the Lucasfilm Games group.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.550
And he and I just
really hit it off

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.320
and we had a really
great friendship.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.560
And we just started just
working on this weird idea

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.040
we had for this mansion,
and this weird family that

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.720
lives there.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.330
And this group of
kids that go in

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.740
and all the stuff which later
became "Maniac Mansion."

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.990
And I think we just kind
of started working on this.

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.406
I mean, nobody
gave us permission.

00:05:00.406 --> 00:05:02.030
we just kind of
started working on it.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.580
And, you know, I think it was--

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.510
in those early days of
Lucasfilm, you know,

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.400
games weren't really green-lit.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.647
There was no process.

00:05:11.647 --> 00:05:13.480
I mean, people just
started working on them,

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.420
and then when nobody told
them not to it kind of just

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.520
became a game at that point.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.220
That's kind of the way "Maniac
Mansion" really developed.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.190
SPEAKER: It's still
considered a seminal game

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.020
for the genre, many mention.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.140
RON GILBERT: Yeah, it's kind of
the first true point and click

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.115
adventure game.

00:05:30.115 --> 00:05:30.700
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.540
So how did that come about?

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.870
Did you look at other games,
like the Sierra games,

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.392
and think about how do
you improve on that?

00:05:37.392 --> 00:05:39.100
RON GILBERT: Yeah I
looked at-- you know,

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.620
Gary and I started working
on "Maniac Mansion."

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.760
And we had a lot of story
ideas, but we had no game.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.450
We had no idea what this
game was going to be.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.360
We just knew there
was this weird family.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.982
And we knew it
was weird mansion.

00:05:53.982 --> 00:05:56.440
And we had a bunch of weird
stuff that was going to happen,

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.270
but we had no game.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.420
And I-- it was during
a Christmas break,

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.120
I went and I visited
my aunt and uncle.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.480
And my cousin was
playing "King's Quest I."

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.810
And that's the first time
I'd ever seen "King's Quest."

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.170
And I remember just watching
him the entire vacation sitting

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:16.576
there playing this game
called "King's Quest,"

00:06:16.576 --> 00:06:17.950
and it just kind
of dawned on me.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.530
It's oh, this is what
"Maniac Mansion" needs to be.

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.390
It needs to be an
adventure game.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.390
I had played text
adventures and stuff,

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.915
but I never really thought
about "Maniac Mansion"

00:06:26.915 --> 00:06:27.790
as an adventure game.

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.360
Because I think, you
know, Gary and I always--

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.280
had always figured it was
going to be a very visual game.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.380
And to me, adventure games
were text adventures.

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.540
But seeing "King's
Quest" kind of--

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.380
it's like a hit in the head.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:42.527
And I go, OK.

00:06:42.527 --> 00:06:44.360
You know, adventure
games can have graphics.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.670
And-- but I really--

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:47.070
I just hated the parser.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:48.040
I hated typing.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.080
It's probably because
I can't spell at all.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.910
And so it was just getting
rid of with the parser.

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:57.490
And it was-- as I
played "King's Quest,"

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.775
I realized there's only about
10 verbs it really understands,

00:07:00.775 --> 00:07:01.450
right?

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.971
Everything else is
just like synonyms.

00:07:03.971 --> 00:07:04.720
And so it's like--

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.420
I just kind of boiled it
down to those 10 things

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:11.465
and those became the verbs that
showed up in "Maniac Mansion."

00:07:11.465 --> 00:07:14.230
SPEAKER: There are rumors
that Steven Spielberg took

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:17.650
some interest in what you
were doing at Lucasfilm games?

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:19.150
RON GILBERT: Yeah, yes.

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.220
Spielberg was a huge
gamer, you know?

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:24.400
And then back then,
he just loved games.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.800
And whenever he would come and
visit George up at the ranch,

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.090
he always had to come by
and see what, you know,

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:32.060
what we were doing.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.022
And and he was, I mean
he was a great person.

00:07:34.022 --> 00:07:35.980
Because, you know, he
wasn't the kind of person

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.630
who would come into
the room and kind

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.940
of sit there and look
at your demo and go,

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:40.800
that's kind of nice.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.300
I mean, he wanted
to play it, right?

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.270
And he was just in
there trying to do it.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.900
So I think my claim to
fame is I got in a fight

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.640
with Steven Spielberg
over a mouse.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:52.448
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:52.448 --> 00:07:56.860
SPEAKER: So how does it
feel to be considered

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.050
a pioneer of the
video gaming industry,

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:02.290
and still one of the
very big names in it?

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:04.010
Is it more advantage?

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:07.810
That, for example, it's easier
to do crowd funding nowadays?

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:11.620
Or would you rather have
some more time under cover

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.160
to develop your games?

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.400
RON GILBERT: Well it
certainly is an advantage,

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.050
in that, you know,
things like doing crowd

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:19.720
funding for "Thimbleweed Park."

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:25.000
You know that having a name in
the business helps you a lot.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.520
I don't know that we would
have gotten the game funded,

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:31.210
had we not had the
name that we had.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:34.000
But, I mean, it can also be
a little bit of a detriment.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.789
I'm so known for
point-and-click games

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:40.349
that people just assume that's
all I want to do with my life,

00:08:40.349 --> 00:08:41.890
is just make a
point-and-click games.

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:47.425
And so there's a little bit
of that kind of comes with it.

00:08:47.425 --> 00:08:49.450
SPEAKER: So the Monkey
Island games are,

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:54.430
I think, the games which
are most famous for being

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.230
associated with your name.

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:59.530
But after "Monkey
Island 2," you left

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:03.720
LucasArts to fund
Humongous Entertainment.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:08.650
And that was a time where
the LucasArts games were

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:11.230
very popular and very famous.

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:13.370
Why did you decide
to try something new,

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:16.210
and found Humongous
Entertainment and target

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:17.020
children?

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:17.860
As opposed to--

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:22.130
RON GILBERT: Well, you
know, the Lucasfilm games--

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:24.730
you know, the Sierra
games were always

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:27.250
a lot more popular in the US.

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:29.950
And that was very
frustrating to us.

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:32.270
It's like, we put
out in Monkey Island

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:34.060
and it got good review scores.

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:37.960
And, you know, "King's Quest
5" sold 10 times the number

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.139
of copies.

00:09:39.139 --> 00:09:40.930
And so that was always
kind of frustrating.

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:42.970
And, you know, so people do ask.

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:44.980
It's like, why did
you leave Lucasfilm?

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:47.080
It's like you had this
amazing franchise.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.630
Monkey Island was this
monster hit and you left.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:52.210
And it's like, well it
really wasn't, right?

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:55.000
I mean, at the time, you know,
Monkey Island was a good game

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.235
and really proud of it, and--

00:09:56.235 --> 00:09:58.360
SPEAKER: It's probably my
German perspective of it.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.830
RON GILBERT: Yeah.

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:03.060
And it was completely the
opposite in Europe, right?

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.500
Like Europe, the Lucasfilm
games were hugely popular

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.920
and the Sierra games
weren't quite as popular.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.510
But you know, I
didn't really have

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:13.140
a lot of visibility
into what was going on

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:14.525
in Europe with that stuff.

00:10:14.525 --> 00:10:16.150
It's like, I knew
they were translated.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:18.100
But we had no
internet back then.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.700
So you didn't get that
immediate feedback from people

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.950
that, oh, this is really
getting popular over here.

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:27.640
So I just--it's not something
that really occurred to me.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:33.010
So I don't feel like I left
this hugely successful franchise

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:35.730
to go do Humongous
Entertainment.

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:38.440
But Humongous
Entertainment really

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.500
started from watching a
five-year-old play "Monkey

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:42.490
Island."

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:44.560
And, you know, he
was playing the game,

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.170
and he couldn't really read.

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:49.280
There was no voice in
the game back then,

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.620
and he couldn't read.

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:54.340
So he had no idea what was
going on in the story at all.

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:57.220
And, you know, he
kind of figured out

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:59.470
what the verbs were eventually.

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:01.750
But he was just
having so much fun

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:05.780
walking around the world
opening and closing doors.

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:07.720
And just walking
through the doors

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.060
and talking to people,
even though he had

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:11.830
no idea what was being said.

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:14.060
And occasionally triggering
some weird animation,

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.510
where you step on a plank
and a bird flies away.

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.940
And he just loved
that, and he would

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:21.460
spend hours playing this game.

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.250
And that's when, you know,
I kind of thought about,

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:27.981
well maybe I should just make
adventure games for kids,

00:11:27.981 --> 00:11:28.480
you know?

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:32.400
And not kind of dumbed
down storybooks, you know,

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.470
which had kind of started
to come out at that time.

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:38.530
But real adventure games,
with actual puzzles

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:40.480
and characters and
all those things.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.490
But just simplify
stuff a little bit.

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:46.180
In a normal adventure game,
you might solve a puzzle

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.340
and there might be
four different puzzles

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:51.250
that chain together to you
have to do to solve the thing.

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:53.260
But in the Humongous
Entertainment games,

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:54.880
it was only two chains, right?

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.700
All puzzles were just kind
of two steps to solve them.

00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:59.800
So it was just a
little more simplified,

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.540
but they were real
adventure games.

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:03.490
And so that's kind
of why I decided

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:05.592
to do Humongous Entertainment.

00:12:05.592 --> 00:12:08.710
SPEAKER: In the time after
you left LucasArts more

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:10.990
Monkey Island games
kept coming out.

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:13.530
Curse of Monkey Island,
Escape from Monkey Island.

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:18.520
What was it to see other
people carry on with what

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.460
you started with Monkey Island?

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:23.460
And probably, for
those who don't know,

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:27.460
"Monkey Island 2" left on
a very controversial note.

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:28.440
I loved it--

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.510
RON GILBERT: Oh good.

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:30.177
SPEAKER: --but--

00:12:30.177 --> 00:12:31.676
RON GILBERT: A lot
of people didn't.

00:12:31.676 --> 00:12:32.950
SPEAKER: --some people didn't.

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:37.150
And then to see that you can't
continue from that point,

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:38.110
but others do.

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:39.084
How was that?

00:12:39.084 --> 00:12:40.750
RON GILBERT: I think
it's always strange

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:42.760
when you create
something and then you

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.390
see other people take it on.

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:50.950
And I think it's true
of any creative thing.

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:53.800
It's like when you create it
and you kind of push it out

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:54.859
to the world, right?

00:12:54.859 --> 00:12:56.650
Because it's a little
bit like having a kid

00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:00.130
that you have of raised and then
you shove it out into the world

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:03.040
and cross your fingers and kind
of hope that everything's OK.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.710
And I think anything
creative is like that.

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:08.410
You kind of send it out
there and, you know,

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:09.780
the fans react to it.

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:12.950
And the fans take it places.

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:14.680
And in this case,
you know, people

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.360
made sequels from the games.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.324
And I quite liked
"Monkey Island 3."

00:13:18.324 --> 00:13:19.740
I thought it was
a very good game.

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:22.270
It's not the game
I would have made.

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:24.880
They did they did stuff
I would not have done.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.560
I never would have had
Guybrush marry Elaine.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.200
I never would have done that.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.210
But, so they did--

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:32.260
they did stuff like that.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.490
But I think it's a good game.

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:35.440
You know, I'm kind
of happy to have

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.360
that game as a part of that--

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.145
as a part of the series.

00:13:39.145 --> 00:13:41.410
SPEAKER: I wonder,
as a game developer,

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:43.990
do you also play a lot of games?

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:47.260
Or is it when you spend the
whole day making it that you

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.490
want to do something else?

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:51.430
I remember last time I met you,
you were very much into "World

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:53.500
of Warcraft," but that's
probably a special case.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.030
RON GILBERT: Right.

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:57.755
SPEAKER: So do you also play,
for example, adventure games?

00:13:57.755 --> 00:14:01.660
RON GILBERT: I do play adventure
games, but I play them--

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:04.210
I think I play them
for work reasons.

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:06.190
You know, it's like
I want to understand

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:07.780
what people are doing.

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.430
But I don't play
them for enjoyment

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:11.860
because I'm too close to them.

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:13.660
It's like I can't
play an adventure

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:17.200
game without deconstructing
their puzzles, you know,

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.880
and going, I would
have done that.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.460
I have done a hint over here.

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.010
I would have done this.

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:24.910
And it kind of sucks
all the enjoyment away

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:27.290
from that kind of stuff.

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:28.090
So I don't--

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:29.350
I do play a lot of games.

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:30.730
I like RPG's.

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:35.080
I did play way too much "World
of Warcraft" when it came out.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:38.240
I don't do it anymore.

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:41.167
And I kind of enjoy RPG.

00:14:41.167 --> 00:14:43.000
You know, so I think
that's kind of the game

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.790
that I play for fun,
is that kind of genre.

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:49.220
You know, like
Diablo-style RPG's.

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:50.830
SPEAKER: Jumping a bit in time.

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:54.580
In 2012, your former
colleague Tim Schafer

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:59.860
basically invented
crowd funding for games.

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:02.530
Not really, but he was hugely
successful with collecting

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:07.030
more than $3 million for
"Double Fine Adventure."

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:11.810
And at that point, you were
[NO AUDIO] on the [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:13.610
So how was the atmosphere then?

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:16.160
Because crowd funding was
quite a new thing and no one

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.680
really expected that
amount of money to come in.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.180
RON GILBERT: Yeah I think
it was very surprising.

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:22.220
I mean, I don't think--

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:24.140
I wasn't really involved
in that project.

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.900
So I don't-- I don't really kind
of know the behind-the-scenes

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:27.770
kind of work.

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:34.250
But just as a company, I think
there was this kind of feeling,

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:38.071
I think they asked for like 400
or 350 or something like that,

00:15:38.071 --> 00:15:38.570
initially.

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:41.180
And I think there was this
feeling that they were going

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:42.970
to barely get that, you know?

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:45.350
And there was going to be a
thing where, just at the end,

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:47.891
everybody was going to be out
there begging people for money.

00:15:47.891 --> 00:15:52.180
So when it kind of went through
the roof like that it was--

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:57.090
I think it was a surprise and
a shock to everybody with that.

00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:59.180
SPEAKER: And it
was not for some--

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:02.020
for shooter or for
some popular genre.

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:05.510
Because classic adventure games
by then were quite a niche.

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:08.220
RON GILBERT: Not
for a popular genre.

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:09.870
SPEAKER: I mean--

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:11.362
RON GILBERT: I
know what you mean.

00:16:11.362 --> 00:16:12.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:14.535
Sadly, I know what you mean.

00:16:14.535 --> 00:16:16.692
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:16.692 --> 00:16:20.690
SPEAKER: I don't there are
a lot of classic adventure

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:25.450
games in the last 10 years
that have that kind of budget.

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:28.840
RON GILBERT: Well I think things
like Kickstarter and any crowd

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.190
funding, I think those
platforms work really

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:33.680
well with nostalgia.

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.576
Because-- you know,
anything nostalgic.

00:16:35.576 --> 00:16:36.950
And I think
"Thimbleweed Park" is

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:39.570
an excellent example of that--

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:44.450
that nostalgia kind of hits
us at this emotional level.

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:47.520
And if you can kind
of tap into that,

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.650
I think that's where
Kickstarter really excels.

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:54.560
It's like when you tap into
someone's emotions in some way.

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:56.990
If you want to build a really
successful Kickstarter,

00:16:56.990 --> 00:17:00.020
the thing that I always tell
people when they ask me, is

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:03.500
don't try to sell
people your game.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.890
It's like, sell them
your dream, right?

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:10.380
So it's all about, this is
my dream to make this game.

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:12.079
Not, here's this
game I want to make.

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:15.750
And I have four enemies, and
I have 16 things of armor.

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:18.359
It's like, well that's a box
with a bullet point list,

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:18.859
right?

00:17:18.859 --> 00:17:22.250
Sell them your dream
about what you want to do.

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:25.140
And that kind of taps
into their emotions,

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:28.099
which means it's a lot easier
for them to go and kind of

00:17:28.099 --> 00:17:29.280
do funding.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.340
And I think
nostalgia just easily

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:32.870
taps into that same emotion.

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:37.130
And that's why you've seen games
and other things on Kickstarter

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:41.220
do really well-- because
of the nostalgia component.

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:44.930
SPEAKER: Two years later, you
started your own Kickstarter

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:46.700
project, "Thimbleweed Park."

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.800
And before we talk
about that, I think

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:53.630
we can show a trailer
with scenes from the game.

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:59.600
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:03.990
- My name is Dolores
Edmund, and I am here

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:08.100
to warn you about
Thimbleweed Park.

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:11.700
My uncle built the town and
the world-famous pillow factory

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:15.540
using his brains, sweat,
arrogance, and ego.

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:18.310
Thimbleweed Park was the
center of a social scene--

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:21.450
parties, movie stars,
and rich and famous all

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:24.660
drawn to its flickering
light of promise and vision

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:26.560
of the future.

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:29.100
Then the factory
fell on hard times.

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:31.340
Everything slipped
away, and the town

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:35.300
descended into the shell of
decay and pity before you.

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:36.890
Leaving the pillow
factory the me

00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:39.560
was my uncle's only
plan for redemption.

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:42.890
He knew I could save
it, and him, from ruin

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:44.720
in the eyes of history.

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.610
But I don't want to save it.

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:49.580
Something terrifying
is happening.

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:52.490
Something that itches and
festers and grows with each

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:53.220
scratch.

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:56.210
Something I know my uncle
started, and his death

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:57.260
is making me stronger.

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:02.460
My name is Dolores Edmund.

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:04.290
I am one of only
five people that

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:07.863
can prevent what our careless
ambition and reckless dreams

00:19:07.863 --> 00:19:09.827
have brought upon us.

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:26.430
It's Ransome the
[BLEEP] clown here.

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:32.020
I tell you about this game
called "Thimbleweed Park."

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:33.940
If you think this is a
game about figuring out

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:38.630
who killed the stiff out by the
bridge, you're [BLEEP] wrong.

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:41.260
That rotting corpse is the
least of your [BLEEP] problems

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:42.730
in a town like this.

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:45.970
The town is run by a rich,
narcissistic, egomaniac

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:48.910
who's obsessed with
artificial intelligence built

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:51.710
from vacuum tubes.

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:53.680
Yeah I'm not [BLEEP] kidding.

00:19:56.949 --> 00:19:59.410
Before I was cursed
by this old lady,

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:02.330
I was rich, famous, and
at the top of my game.

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:04.210
Doing sell-out
shows every night.

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:10.960
Now I'm reduced to breaking
into a burnt-out pillow factory

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:14.204
to steal back the plans
for my come back doll.

00:20:14.204 --> 00:20:15.500
Oh yeah.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:18.300
And these [BLEEP] morons
are also going to help.

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.905
Man.

00:20:22.905 --> 00:20:24.096

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:44.250
SPEAKER: That does not look
like most games in 2017.

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:47.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:49.980
You already said
a bit about this,

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:54.860
but what made you decide
to go for this retro style?

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:57.290
I mean it looks like--

00:20:57.290 --> 00:21:03.500
not exactly like 1992,
but it's very close.

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:05.690
What was the decision
process here?

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:09.200
RON GILBERT: Well it started
with-- before the Kickstarter.

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.970
Gary Winnick and I, who did
"Maniac Mansion" together,

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:13.740
we were just having lunch.

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:16.250
And we were talking
about the old Lucasfilm

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:19.220
games like "Maniac Mansion"
and "Loom" and "Monkey Island,"

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.920
and, you know, "Indiana
Jones"-- all those games.

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:26.210
And those games, to us they
had this certain charm to them.

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:29.390
And as much as I like
current adventure games,

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:32.120
like I really enjoy
"Firewatch," "Gone Home,"

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:34.460
and "Kentucky Route Zero,"
and all those things.

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:37.250
But they don't have the same
charm that those games had.

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:41.300
And we were kind of talking
about what is that charm.

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:45.420
What is it that those games
have that a lot of games don't?

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:47.480
And we just didn't know.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:50.780
And we kind of had the
idea of, well, let's just

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:51.860
build one again.

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:55.430
Let's build one like we
built those games back then

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:57.470
and see if we can
figure out what

00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:59.380
that charm was to those games.

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:03.930
And so that really
started the Kickstarter.

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:05.720
Because it was really
kind of the only way

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:09.890
to fund a weird experiment like
that, was through Kickstarter.

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:11.540
So that's really
what started it,

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:16.430
which is kind of why you see
the very 8-bit pixel graphics

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:17.990
and stuff because
it was like, well

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:19.580
is that a part of the charm?

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:22.130
You know, did a lot of
the charm of those games

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:24.070
come from the graphics?

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:26.700
It's kind of a
simplified, almost kind

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:29.230
of icon-based graphics.

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:31.271
Was that really part of it?

00:22:31.271 --> 00:22:33.020
And then the other
thing we wanted to do--

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:35.030
and you don't really see
it from the trailers,

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:38.600
but you really see it if
you actually play the game.

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.600
Our goal was to build
a game that wasn't, you

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.610
know, like a game back then.

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:46.730
But it was like you
remembered a game back then.

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:49.722
So there's just a lot
of stuff going on.

00:22:49.722 --> 00:22:50.930
It's like we have real-time--

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:51.290
SPEAKER: Voiceover.

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:52.789
RON GILBERT: --lights
in our scenes.

00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:54.590
They kind of cast
off of characters

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:56.000
as they walk under things.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.864
And so that's all the stuff
that your mind filled in for you

00:22:59.864 --> 00:23:01.280
when you were
playing those games.

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:02.900
And it's like, well
we're going to do it now

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:04.400
because we have the technology.

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.730
And all the smooth
scrolling, and there's

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:09.170
11 different layers
of parallax that

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:10.839
can move as the screen scrolls.

00:23:10.839 --> 00:23:13.130
And you know, we just didn't
have that stuff back then.

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:14.720
So it's really about--

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.600
this game is really about
recreating that memory, more

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:21.360
than it was kind of
authentically recreating

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.310
that stuff.

00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:23.750
SPEAKER: Speaking
of technology, I

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:30.090
think you still are involved
in really coding the game?

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:35.330
And while that might have
been the thing to do in '87,

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:39.230
nowadays there's almost no one
who actually codes something

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:42.230
and does the creative process.

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:46.990
So do you want to have all
the control over the game?

00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:48.965
Or why do you do that?

00:23:48.965 --> 00:23:51.710
RON GILBERT: I think I
just love programming.

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:54.110
You know, it's like the
engine for this game.

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:59.497
I built this whole 2-D adventure
game engine from the ground up

00:23:59.497 --> 00:24:00.080
for this game.

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:03.530
It's like I didn't use Unity,
I didn't use any stuff,

00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:04.910
I just built the whole thing.

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:05.410
And--

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:07.130
SPEAKER: There are lots of
existing engines around.

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:07.790
RON GILBERT: Yeah, there are.

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:09.498
I mean, there's lots
of really good ones.

00:24:09.498 --> 00:24:12.940
But I think a little bit of
it is that control thing.

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:16.460
You know, I've worked
in other engines before.

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:19.490
And as a programmer I
get very frustrated,

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:22.040
because it's like, well
I want it to do this

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:24.070
and the engine won't do that.

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:26.780
Especially if the engine
is kind of a black box,

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:28.760
you know like Unity can be.

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:32.630
You really can't get in and
start mucking with the code.

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:34.310
That stuff really
just frustrated me.

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:35.510
And I knew--

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:37.370
I knew from the
beginning that we

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:40.670
wanted to do a lot
of different things

00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:41.960
with this game graphically.

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.940
Because we wanted it
to be a game like you

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:45.530
remember those old games.

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:48.290
So I didn't want to use one
of the adventure game systems

00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:51.170
that was currently on the
market because they tend

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:54.770
to more authentically
recreate, you know,

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:56.330
what you could do from that era.

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:59.780
And we really wanted to
really push beyond that stuff.

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:04.130
And I felt like just creating my
own engine for that is probably

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:05.870
the best way to do that.

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:07.520
And I just love to program.

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:10.550
It's what I do for fun.

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:13.607
So it wasn't a hassle at all.

00:25:13.607 --> 00:25:15.440
SPEAKER: So in the day
you're making a game,

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.686
and then in the
evening to relax you--

00:25:17.686 --> 00:25:19.110
RON GILBERT: I program.

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:20.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:20.540
I do.

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:23.410
I have websites and
servers and all this stuff

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:25.100
that I'm just constantly--

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:26.776
constantly mucking with.

00:25:26.776 --> 00:25:28.400
SPEAKER: You mentioned
you started this

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:34.280
with Gary Winnick, who was a
former LucasArts colleague.

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:37.620
You also worked with other
colleagues like Tim Schafer

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:38.680
after you left Lucas.

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:43.130
Is there something like a class
of '92 thing going on, where

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:45.240
you meet up with former
LucasArts colleagues?

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:49.590
Because it was such a
dense place of talent

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:53.985
which still has big names
in the gaming industry.

00:25:53.985 --> 00:25:54.930
RON GILBERT: Yeah.

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:57.540
With "Thimbleweed Park"
it's like I am working

00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:58.620
with Gary Winnick again.

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:00.960
But I'm also working
with David Fox.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:05.640
And David Fox-- when Gary
and I built "Maniac Mansion,"

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.680
there were three people
that built that game.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.450
The whole team was
three people big,

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:11.580
and it was me and
Gary and David Fox.

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:13.890
And David fox did
game programming.

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:16.110
And I built the engine
and did game programming.

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:18.720
Gary did art and so-- but
David's working on this.

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:21.130
He's doing game programming
on this as well.

00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:24.870
And all of the art-- the
background art that you see

00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:26.190
was done by Mark Ferrari.

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:28.380
And Mark Ferrari was
the background artist

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:30.390
on the original "Monkey Island."

00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:35.850
So it is kind of this little
bit of a reunion team of people

00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:37.170
getting together for it.

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:39.810
But you know I think I have
stayed in touch with people.

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:42.400
Like Dave Grossman, you know,
is a good friend of mine.

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.450
And he worked on
"Monkey Island."

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:47.190
And I think we were a small
enough group of people.

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:50.230
I think we just kind of
forged a lot of friendships

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:52.790
in that period.

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:56.220
SPEAKER: So now that the
project is almost finished,

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:57.840
I think it's being
released very soon.

00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:58.530
RON GILBERT: Soon.

00:26:58.530 --> 00:26:59.375
SPEAKER: So already a date?

00:26:59.375 --> 00:26:59.970
RON GILBERT: Soon.

00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:01.053
SPEAKER: Soon is the date?

00:27:01.053 --> 00:27:03.240
RON GILBERT: It's
on the 17th of soon.

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:07.695
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:07.695 --> 00:27:11.820
SPEAKER: Looking back, the
decision to go to Kickstarter.

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:13.740
I've talked to a couple
of game developers

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:16.470
and some are very happy with the
decision to go to Kickstarter.

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:17.700
Some are not so happy.

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:19.125
What's your perspective?

00:27:19.125 --> 00:27:22.800
RON GILBERT: I'm really happy
that we went to Kickstarter.

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:26.580
I think one of the
things that we really

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:28.260
wanted to do with
the Kickstarter was

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:32.040
to make sure that we were very
open about our development.

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:36.900
And it wasn't just about sending
monthly Kickstarter updates

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:39.000
and, you know, hey,
this is where we are.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.560
But we really wanted
to really, really talk

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.060
about the development
of the game.

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:49.146
And we started a blog
and a podcast that we do.

00:27:49.146 --> 00:27:50.520
And we talk about
a lot of stuff.

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:53.970
It's like, I post code on
there, and I talk about coding

00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:55.500
and how I'm coding stuff up.

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:58.980
And we talk about our dialog
system and how that works.

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:00.420
And we talk about testing.

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:02.370
We talk about all these
different components.

00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:03.860
And we talk about budget.

00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:05.040
It's like I, know--

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:06.685
I published a little
spreadsheet which

00:28:06.685 --> 00:28:09.310
is our budget for the game and
I kind of walked people through.

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:10.684
Well this is how
I budget a game.

00:28:10.684 --> 00:28:13.650
This is how I account for
all the people and the time

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:14.900
and all these kinds of things.

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:18.450
So I think we've been
really open with people.

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:20.790
And I think a lot of
Kickstarter projects

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:26.040
that I've seen where backers
kind of turn on the developers.

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:28.350
And I think that mostly
comes from just the lack

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:29.730
of communication.

00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:32.130
I think if you
communicate with people

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:34.710
and you explain to
them what's going on,

00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:37.710
you can really kind
of hold them in a way.

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:40.680
And that's what we've
really tried to do.

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:43.950
And I think it's been
a wonderful process

00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:49.360
I mean, these books that you see
on this little screenshot here.

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:52.080
We-- I wanted to have
all of these books

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:55.470
for the library in the
mansion that Dolores lives in.

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:59.790
And I thought, well, what
would be really fun if--

00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:01.500
rather than just
these graphic images

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.570
you can't do anything
with, it if you actually

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:06.240
had little books that
were like two pages long.

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.949
And so every time you clicked
on a book it would pop it open,

00:29:08.949 --> 00:29:09.990
and there'd be two pages.

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:12.180
And that would be really fun.

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:14.450
But we didn't have
the time to do that.

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:16.650
And I figured, well I'm
going to go to the blog

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:20.070
and I'm going to ask the backers
and the readers of the blog

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:22.259
if they were interested
maybe just writing

00:29:22.259 --> 00:29:23.550
a couple of pages for the book.

00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:27.790
And I figured, well, maybe we'll
get like 150 of these books,

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:30.120
and it will be really
good for the library.

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:33.720
And we got over
1,000 submissions.

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:38.130
And so if you go into the
library in Delores' mansion,

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:43.560
there are 1050 books in the
library that you can read

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:46.830
two pages of every single book.

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:47.614
And some of them--

00:29:47.614 --> 00:29:48.780
SPEAKER: All with voiceover?

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:50.355
RON GILBERT: Not with voiceover.

00:29:50.355 --> 00:29:52.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:53.700
No, no.

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.970
You can just read them.

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:57.910
And some of them
are just wonderful.

00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:00.060
I mean, some people
just spend a lot

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:02.710
of time just really thinking
about their two pages,

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:03.210
you know?

00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:06.180
And this one group of
friends got together

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:08.730
and they did a whole
choose your own adventure.

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:10.890
Where it's like one--
you read one book

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:13.622
and it says, if you want to
do this go read this book.

00:30:13.622 --> 00:30:15.330
If you want to do this
go read this book.

00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:17.310
And you have to
go find that book.

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:19.300
And it's just I mean
it's wonderful, right?

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:22.730
And so I think the backers
and the readers of the blog,

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:24.360
I think they've
really contributed

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:26.850
to this game with
things like the book.

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:29.010
And we have a
voicemail system, where

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:33.450
if you backed the
game at more than $50,

00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:36.320
you got your name in the
Thimbleweed Park phone book.

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:41.240
And if you go to these
numbers, and you actually

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:44.000
dial the number into
the phone in the game,

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.370
you get a voicemail message
that the backer had recorded.

00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:50.060
You know and there are
4,000 names in the phone

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:52.685
book, 900 of which are Germans.

00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:00.290
So you know, there's 4,000
names in this phone book.

00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:01.820
And you go and you
dial up the names

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:04.670
and you get these just charming
little voicemail messages

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:07.940
the backers have recorded
and are playing in the game.

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:09.920
So I think that's
just kind of a way

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:12.940
that I think that the people
who have backed and supported

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:15.860
the game just have made
the game so much better.

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:19.806
It's just so much richer
with their involvement in it.

00:31:19.806 --> 00:31:22.190
SPEAKER: Kind of
a recurring theme.

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:24.350
There was a library
in "Monkey Island 2."

00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:25.846
There was one in--

00:31:25.846 --> 00:31:27.220
RON GILBERT: In
Fat Island, yeah.

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:28.740
SPEAKER: --The last crusade.

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:29.650
Now this.

00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:31.366
What's going to happen
in your next game?

00:31:31.366 --> 00:31:33.650
RON GILBERT: I don't know
what I'm going to do?

00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:34.410
How do I top that?

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:38.120
How do you top 1,000
books a library to read?

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:41.810
But we brought play testers
in to play the game.

00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:44.375
And, you know, sometimes
they hit that library.

00:31:44.375 --> 00:31:46.550
And they're like,
oh my god, I'm going

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:50.580
to spend hours in this
library reading these books.

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:51.920
So some people just love it.

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:53.420
SPEAKER: But there's
not one of them

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:54.740
which has vital information.

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:56.210
RON GILBERT: There is.

00:31:56.210 --> 00:32:01.580
There are two books
in the library

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:05.390
that contain vital information
in solving a puzzle.

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:10.280
But fortunately, there are
lots of clues and stuff

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:12.750
to tell you exactly
where those books are.

00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:18.590
So we don't expect you to
go through and read 1,000

00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:21.290
books looking for the one book.

00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:23.840
SPEAKER: We'll soon open up
to questions for the floor.

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:26.660
So if you have questions,
please go to the microphone

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:28.050
in the middle.

00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:31.610
That's easier for the cameras.

00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:34.790
I will have one more
question, and we will open up.

00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:38.456
So what's going on
with the toilet paper?

00:32:38.456 --> 00:32:41.780
RON GILBERT: Yeah
the toilet paper.

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:45.800
I posted a picture of the
bathroom in Thimbleweed Park,

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:47.450
at the quickie pal.

00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:50.829
And, you know, like
any public restroom

00:32:50.829 --> 00:32:52.370
and you have some
toilet paper there.

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:55.970
But the toilet paper like
curved under the roll,

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:58.490
rather than curving
over the roll.

00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:00.470
And I posted a
picture on Twitter.

00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:02.840
And I just-- I wasn't thinking
about the toilet paper.

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:04.860
I just posted a picture
of the bathroom,

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:07.160
because I thought the bathroom
was really interesting.

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:11.110
And it just kind of
created this storm of--

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:15.950
and I mean literally hundreds of
tweets coming at me, telling me

00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:18.530
the toilet paper was wrong.

00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:22.040
The toilet paper is supposed
to curve over the roll,

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.840
not under the roll.

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:27.510
And it just became
this thing, you know?

00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:32.570
And so you know it's kind
of interesting because Mark

00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:34.970
Ferrari, when he
did the bathroom,

00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:37.070
he did the toilet
paper hanging under.

00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:39.950
And I remember he delivered
that piece of art to us

00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:42.680
and I think David was the
first one that got it.

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:44.360
And you know, David
kind of slacked

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:47.510
me and he's like, hey,
the toilet paper is wrong.

00:33:47.510 --> 00:33:50.720
And I kind of went and I looked
at it and went, oh yeah, it is.

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:53.900
And then we both said,
no one will notice.

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:57.380
And we just-- and then we just
went on with stuff and then

00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:58.950
that whole Twitter
thing happened.

00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:05.540
And it was-- you kind of got
to the point where we were kind

00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:06.940
of talking about it on slack.

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:09.500
And we was like, wow,
we should put an option.

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.659
We should put an option
for the toilet paper.

00:34:11.659 --> 00:34:14.780
So when you're playing the game,
if you go to the options menu,

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:18.080
and you snake down into the
video menu and all that stuff,

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:20.580
there's a little check
box-- toilet paper under.

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:24.500
You just click it and it just
switches the toilet paper.

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:26.000
And we thought we
thought that would

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.659
be more interesting than
having an in-game way to do it.

00:34:29.659 --> 00:34:32.120
It was such a weird
thing it's like, no,

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:35.239
it's got to just
be a menu option.

00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:38.594
That's the way it needs to be.

00:34:38.594 --> 00:34:41.515
SPEAKER: OK, I think we have
a question on the floor.

00:34:41.515 --> 00:34:43.760
AUDIENCE: Hello,
my name is Marina.

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.110
Huge fan.

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:48.500
Your games were also
popular in Latin America.

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:51.000
They taught me a lot
of things as a child,

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.570
for example, the notion
of transferable skills

00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:55.889
with the sword challenge
in Monkey Island.

00:34:55.889 --> 00:34:57.320
So kudos for that.

00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:00.110
And also, thank you
so much for making

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:02.300
the sword master a woman.

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:06.320
Because in an industry that
is largely dominated by males,

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:08.300
that was a very
empowering message.

00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:12.710
So I wanted to ask you about
the character creation process

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:16.580
and how do you profile
each of the characters

00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:20.684
in terms of psychology,
motivations etc?

00:35:20.684 --> 00:35:22.100
RON GILBERT: I
don't think there's

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:25.100
a scientific process to that.

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:28.700
It's like when I'm creating
characters for a game,

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:32.510
it's just whatever I think
is interesting, you know?

00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:34.790
And so the characters
just kind of get created

00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:36.960
and I don't really
know, necessarily,

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:40.530
where those sparks come from.

00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:43.620
Sometimes they're driven
very heavily by the story.

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:45.960
Obviously, you know,
the two agents in this

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.160
are kind of driven by that.

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:50.430
But you know, for the two agents
that are in Thimbleweed Park,

00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:51.150
it's like--

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:55.590
I didn't want to have that
typical or stereotypical kind

00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:58.010
of agent buddy system--

00:35:58.010 --> 00:36:01.590
partners going out
and do a crime.

00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:04.530
I wanted to do something a
little bit different with them.

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:09.990
And what we came up with is
that the two agents both kind of

00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:11.780
stumble on the body separately.

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:15.630
It's like they're not
partners, and there's

00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:18.210
a huge amount of
distrust between them

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:19.960
because they don't
really know each other.

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:22.770
And for good reason
because, neither of them

00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:25.370
are there to actually
investigate the body, right?

00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:27.830
They're there for these
whole other reasons in town.

00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:30.505
And it just felt more
interesting to me

00:36:30.505 --> 00:36:32.130
to have these two
agents that were kind

00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:34.780
of at odds with each other.

00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:39.520
And in terms of Carla, the
swordmaster in "Monkey Island,"

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:42.580
she's based on a person
that worked in tech support

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:44.490
at Lucasfilm, named Carla.

00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:48.500
And you know, Carla looks
very much like the close-ups

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:51.110
of the swordmaster.

00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:53.370
And I don't I don't
exactly remember.

00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:56.340
I think it was probably
just some weird thing where

00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:58.350
we were having a conversation
with her one day,

00:36:58.350 --> 00:37:01.120
and she really loved the
sword fighting or something,

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:03.270
and we went, you're
the Swordmaster.

00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:05.790
So it's kind of probably
how it happened.

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:07.914
I don't remember exactly.

00:37:07.914 --> 00:37:10.950
SPEAKER: Another question?

00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:14.310
AUDIENCE: I think I have two,
but will choose one I like.

00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:18.720
Lately, video games tend not
to be only about video games.

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:20.910
Like the monetization
part of video games,

00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:23.690
with purchases, ads, or
these kind of things,

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:28.440
are very deeply
entangled with game play.

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:30.690
And how do you feel about that?

00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:32.944
Like, how do you feel it
impacts the experience?

00:37:32.944 --> 00:37:34.860
How do you feel the
future of the monetization

00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:36.560
for games should be, or will be?

00:37:40.168 --> 00:37:45.030
RON GILBERT: I'm not a big
fan of current monetization

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:49.710
of mobile games and
stuff, because I

00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:56.700
feel like a lot of that
stuff, you know, designers--

00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:59.760
or it's probably really
not even the designers.

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:01.800
It's probably more
of the marketing

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:04.650
and those departments.

00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:09.240
That they're really kind
of feeding off people's

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:11.700
almost gambling impulses, right?

00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:15.690
That it isn't about
building a really great game

00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:18.090
that you want to give
a lot of money to.

00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:19.530
I'm fine with that.

00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:21.720
It's like, if I build a
really great game that

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:24.869
is just really fun and
you enjoy it, you know,

00:38:24.869 --> 00:38:25.660
that's really good.

00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:27.750
I mean, god knows I spent
thousands of dollars

00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:29.010
on "World of Warcraft."

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:33.160
But I don't think that
it was because they

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:35.520
had kind of tapped into
this weird gambling

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:36.870
part of my brain.

00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:38.601
They just built a
really good game,

00:38:38.601 --> 00:38:41.100
and I was happy to give them a
bunch of money over the years

00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:41.670
to play that.

00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:44.370
Where, I think a lot of
the monetization now,

00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:49.200
and especially with this kind of
live A/B testing that goes on,

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:51.660
it's like they can
just narrow something

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:53.630
down to just that right
little button click

00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:54.630
that you're going to do.

00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:57.102
And I just don't feel like a
lot of that is game design.

00:38:57.102 --> 00:38:58.560
I mean there are
exceptions, right?

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:00.185
There are some really
good mobile games

00:39:00.185 --> 00:39:02.790
that do in-app purchases
that are really good games.

00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:05.300
But it just feels like
a lot of it is more

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:08.370
this the science of
pulling money out of you,

00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:11.220
rather than the
art of game design.

00:39:15.306 --> 00:39:18.100
AUDIENCE: So starting
programming on the Commodore

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:20.830
was a very, very different
experience probably

00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:23.110
than programming today.

00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:26.680
Were there any features or
game systems that you really

00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:29.920
wanted to put in "Maniac
Mansion" or "Monkey Island"

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.590
that you just couldn't because
there wasn't enough memory,

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:34.910
or your processing
power wasn't enough?

00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:38.050
And then from that,
were there any

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:40.660
of those kind of long,
percolating ideas

00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:42.475
that you did put in
"Thimbleweed Park"?

00:39:42.475 --> 00:39:45.910
RON GILBERT: Yeah there's two
things really come to mind.

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:48.880
One are the arcade games.

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:52.000
If you go into "Maniac Mansion,"
there's a bunch of arcade games

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.390
that are up on the third floor,
I think, but none of them

00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:56.477
are playable.

00:39:56.477 --> 00:39:58.810
And that was the kind of thing
where we kind of thought,

00:39:58.810 --> 00:40:01.090
oh, we should make all
these games playable.

00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:03.830
But we didn't have
the disk space, right?

00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:06.190
I mean "Maniac Mansion"
on the Commodore 64

00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:10.000
was two sides of a single
density floppy disk.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.330
Which was 320k, all right?

00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:15.820
Not meg, k.

00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:17.200
That was entire game.

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.810
And so we couldn't
really get all

00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:21.670
of the arcade games working.

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:25.510
And for "Thimbleweed
Park" we have an arcade

00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:27.910
in the town that can go into.

00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:29.500
And there are all
these arcade games.

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:31.000
And we thought, excellent!

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.540
We're finally going to get
all of these games working.

00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:36.925
But we totally ran out of time.

00:40:36.925 --> 00:40:39.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:41.890
So none of the arcade
games are playable.

00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:45.350
But through the
miracle of patching,

00:40:45.350 --> 00:40:47.710
which is really simple
to do these days,

00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:49.570
soon as the game
ships we're going

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:51.580
to jump in and get all
those arcades working

00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:53.240
and then there will
be a patch that

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:54.640
will get them all functioning.

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:56.639
So that's one example.

00:40:56.639 --> 00:40:58.180
The other example
that comes to mind,

00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:00.680
if you play "Maniac
Mansion," there

00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:03.580
are several ladders in the game.

00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:07.030
And when people use
the ladders, they just

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:08.890
walk up the ladders, right?

00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:10.820
There's no climbing animation.

00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:13.630
They just they just
do their normal walk

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:15.430
and we just kind of
vertically move them

00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:16.870
up the screen when they do it.

00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:18.940
Because we just don't
have the space, right,

00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:21.220
to do an actual
climbing animation.

00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:25.870
We were so incredibly
tight with--

00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:27.350
on the memory that
we could have,

00:41:27.350 --> 00:41:29.920
the number of things that we
would have loaded, as well

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:30.760
as what was on disk.

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:32.560
We just couldn't do
climbing animations.

00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:35.980
And that was something that
just bugged the hell out of me

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:37.340
at the time.

00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:39.550
But with "Thimbleweed
Park," as you can see,

00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:41.500
we have ladders in
"Thimbleweed Park."

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:44.620
And we have climbing animation.

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:46.510
So when characters
get on ladders,

00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:48.670
they actually go into
climbing animations.

00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:53.950
And that was very cathartic for
me to see climbing animations.

00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:57.598
So those are kind of two
things that come to mind

00:41:57.598 --> 00:42:00.310
SPEAKER: There was a computer
in the other tentacle

00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:03.544
a couple of years later, after
"Maniac Mansion," where you

00:42:03.544 --> 00:42:04.710
could play "Maniac Mansion."

00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:06.781
RON GILBERT: You
could play it, yeah.

00:42:06.781 --> 00:42:09.285
SPEAKER: Yeah, but one
doesn't have a predecessor

00:42:09.285 --> 00:42:12.194
that you could play.

00:42:12.194 --> 00:42:14.930
AUDIENCE: So getting
back to-- you

00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:18.120
were talking about the charm
of some of these older games.

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:21.086
Something I've sort of
thought about as well.

00:42:21.086 --> 00:42:22.585
Some of it maybe
comes from the fact

00:42:22.585 --> 00:42:25.056
that limitations forced you
to be a bit more abstract,

00:42:25.056 --> 00:42:26.430
I think, in a lot
of these games.

00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:29.730
Which gave more wiggle room
then for weirder things

00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:32.790
to happen that just don't work
when things are more realistic,

00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:35.880
and also engage the person
playing with a game a bit more.

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:38.132
Because you've got to
imagine some of it yourself

00:42:38.132 --> 00:42:39.840
if, you know, you're
filling in the gaps.

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:42.320
So just, what do
you think about--

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:45.630
RON GILBERT: I think
that's very right.

00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:48.600
I think that's one of
the things that we've

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:52.260
discovered through the process
of making "Thimbleweed Park,"

00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:56.370
is I do think that the
8-bit graphics kind of allow

00:42:56.370 --> 00:42:59.070
for a lot more imagination.

00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:01.980
And Gary, doing
the art and stuff,

00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:07.920
it's like he was saying,
that that isn't an agent.

00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:11.100
That's an icon of an agent.

00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:14.460
And because of that,
you can kind of

00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:16.740
extrapolate in your mind.

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:18.270
And we very carefully--
it's like we

00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:20.880
never show closeups of
any of the characters.

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:22.500
We never have
scenes where you cut

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:26.250
to a close up of this highly
rendered, painted face

00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:27.450
of anybody.

00:43:27.450 --> 00:43:30.750
We always keep them in
that same kind of view.

00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:33.000
For that exact
reason, that I think

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.830
it just allows your
imagination to go a lot more.

00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:40.860
And I think the other thing
that we've kind of discovered,

00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:43.020
in terms of the
charm of those games,

00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:47.580
is kind of what I've come
to call this sense of place.

00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:50.360
That I think-- that
"Maniac Mansion,"

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:52.740
it was this weird house.

00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:55.110
And you got to know the house.

00:43:55.110 --> 00:43:56.850
And the house was almost--

00:43:56.850 --> 00:43:59.170
became the main character
of "Maniac Mansion."

00:43:59.170 --> 00:44:01.380
And you explored the house.

00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:03.780
And you got to understand
where all the rooms were,

00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:06.370
and you built this little
mental map of the house.

00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:09.480
And it had this really strong
sense of place, you know?

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:11.780
And all the characters
that did it.

00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:15.510
And I think a lot of the
Lucasfilm adventures had that.

00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:18.900
They always created really
interesting environments,

00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:21.900
and we spent a
lot of time trying

00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:24.596
to make those environments
feel like real places.

00:44:24.596 --> 00:44:26.220
You know, there were
just weird things.

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:28.230
Like you turn on the
water in the kitchen

00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:29.430
and it would actually run.

00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:31.140
And you'd open up
the refrigerator

00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:33.051
and there was stuff in there.

00:44:33.051 --> 00:44:35.550
And that's something we tried
to do with "Thimbleweed Park,"

00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:37.800
is we tried to make
it this real place

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:39.760
and give it a sense of place.

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:43.320
And there's over 50 characters
in "Thimbleweed Park,"

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:45.780
and 47 of them are
all voice acted.

00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:49.230
And they all kind of inhabit
their place in the town.

00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:52.210
And they run the stores,
and they do this stuff.

00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:54.960
And it's all a part of that
kind of sense of place.

00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:59.340
So I think the 8-bit graphics
and that sense of place.

00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:01.570
I think they are
two major components

00:45:01.570 --> 00:45:05.024
to the charm of those games.

00:45:05.024 --> 00:45:06.950
SPEAKER: So these
agents, I guess,

00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:10.336
could be Mulder and Scully or
could not be Mulder and Scully.

00:45:10.336 --> 00:45:11.960
RON GILBERT: Well I
don't think they're

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:13.490
Mulder and Scully
because they don't

00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:15.620
have the personalities at all.

00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:17.990
I mean, Mulder and
Scully were partners

00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:20.740
and they were in it
together and all this stuff.

00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:23.700
Where Agent Ray and
Reyez hate each other.

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:27.850
And they're clearly
not in this together.

00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:29.990
You know, there are
times when they're

00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:32.460
trying to thwart each
other and all this stuff.

00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:35.450
So I mean they're definitely
not Mulder and Scully.

00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:37.660
SPEAKER: OK.

00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:39.190
AUDIENCE: Hello sir.

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:40.900
First of all, your
games are amazing.

00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:42.580
Thanks.

00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:44.890
We played them in Brazil.

00:45:44.890 --> 00:45:48.220
So one thing that's different,
you talk about Sierra games

00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:50.670
a little, is that they
were very punishing.

00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:51.640
So you die.

00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:53.710
You die, and you have
to start all over again.

00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:57.220
For LucasArts games, it's
funnier because yeah,

00:45:57.220 --> 00:45:58.855
you can keep going.

00:45:58.855 --> 00:46:01.230
And of course sometimes you
got blocked, but did do have,

00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:01.840
like--

00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:03.460
did you think about
this back then?

00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:05.860
Because Nintendo games,
for example, you die

00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:08.560
and you have to restart
over it and sometimes it's

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:09.860
kind of boring.

00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:14.594
And how does it impact
your game design decisions?

00:46:14.594 --> 00:46:16.510
RON GILBERT: Yeah we
thought about that a lot.

00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:19.386
If you play the original
"Maniac Mansion,"

00:46:19.386 --> 00:46:21.010
there were lots of
places that you die.

00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:24.040
And there were lots
of puzzles where just

00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:27.130
doing the wrong thing would
completely screw you over.

00:46:27.130 --> 00:46:31.120
It's like, there was this
can of Pepsi that you find,

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:34.770
which was actually product
placement, I might add.

00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:40.180
There was this can of Pepsi
in the game and you needed it.

00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:43.010
You needed to give it
to the man-eating plant,

00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:45.070
so the man-eating plant
would start burping.

00:46:45.070 --> 00:46:47.544
So then you could climb
up the man-eating plant.

00:46:47.544 --> 00:46:49.210
But you could also
take the can of Pepsi

00:46:49.210 --> 00:46:53.330
and you could pour
it down the drain.

00:46:53.330 --> 00:46:57.550
And if you did that there
was no way to win the game.

00:46:57.550 --> 00:46:59.860
Because you didn't have
a can of Pepsi anymore.

00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:02.940
And we never told you that.

00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:05.410
You know, so you would pour
the can of Pepsi down the drain

00:47:05.410 --> 00:47:07.576
or you would do something
else with the can of Pepsi

00:47:07.576 --> 00:47:10.750
and there was no clue at all
that you had just completely

00:47:10.750 --> 00:47:12.520
screwed your game up.

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:16.847
And I think some of that
comes from just being naive,

00:47:16.847 --> 00:47:18.430
that it really was
the first adventure

00:47:18.430 --> 00:47:19.660
game that we had done.

00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:24.140
And "Maniac Mansion" is just
filled with that kind of stuff.

00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:25.690
And when I went and I did--

00:47:25.690 --> 00:47:27.400
right before I did
"Monkey Island"

00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:30.880
I wrote this article for this--

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:33.830
it was called the Journal of
Computer Game Design really

00:47:33.830 --> 00:47:35.500
high-falluting sounding name.

00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:39.040
But it was this little magazine
that you could do stuff.

00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:40.660
And I submitted
this article called

00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:45.730
"Why Adventure Games
Suck," and it was 15 rules

00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:49.019
that I had formulated for
designing adventure games.

00:47:49.019 --> 00:47:50.560
If you go to my site
grumpygamer.com,

00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:53.590
it's actually up there
and you can read it.

00:47:53.590 --> 00:47:58.330
And one of the rules that I
come up with was, no death.

00:47:58.330 --> 00:48:04.000
And I kind of felt like if
you die in an adventure game

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.480
you're basically pulled
out of the fantasy.

00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:09.760
Because you've spent
this time, you're

00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:11.890
living in this pirate world.

00:48:11.890 --> 00:48:14.330
And suddenly you die,
and you're pulled out

00:48:14.330 --> 00:48:15.250
of the whole fantasy.

00:48:15.250 --> 00:48:17.890
And you have to pull up
this menu of saved games

00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:21.310
and you have to go find your
last saved game and load it.

00:48:21.310 --> 00:48:22.910
And that just felt wrong to me.

00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:26.110
It felt to me that you should
be able to start the game,

00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:28.990
and sit down in
your big comfy chair

00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:32.500
and just lose yourself for
hours and just never get

00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:34.030
pulled out of the fantasy.

00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:36.060
And so that was really
kind of the main reason

00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:39.460
that I just said,
there's just no death.

00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:41.080
No death in adventure games.

00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:42.467
So it's kind of that reason.

00:48:42.467 --> 00:48:43.800
AUDIENCE: Thanks for doing that.

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:45.800
RON GILBERT: Thank you.

00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:49.022
SPEAKER: Any more questions?

00:48:49.022 --> 00:48:53.220
I have one more, and
then I think we finished.

00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:53.720
VR.

00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:56.920
Last year was the
big year for VR.

00:48:56.920 --> 00:49:01.480
So that is quite a
two-dimensional game, but

00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:04.312
what's your perspective on this?

00:49:04.312 --> 00:49:06.270
Do you think it's the
next big thing in gaming,

00:49:06.270 --> 00:49:07.852
or do you think
it's just a trend?

00:49:07.852 --> 00:49:09.310
RON GILBERT: You
know, I don't know

00:49:09.310 --> 00:49:11.680
that I'm the right
person to ask because VR

00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:13.234
makes me motion sick.

00:49:13.234 --> 00:49:14.650
It's like, I'm one
of those people

00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:19.450
that I put on a VR helmet
and within a few minutes

00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:22.870
I'm just completely
sick from it.

00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:26.236
So I don't do a lot of VR,
so I'm the first person

00:49:26.236 --> 00:49:29.910
to kind of say I don't
know that I understand VR.

00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:33.550
Because I don't really do
it with that kind of stuff.

00:49:33.550 --> 00:49:35.350
It does kind of occur to me--

00:49:35.350 --> 00:49:38.440
like, I think VR is
absolutely the future.

00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:40.220
There's no question about that.

00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:43.330
I just I kind of think
that future is 25 or 30

00:49:43.330 --> 00:49:46.370
years from now, not right now.

00:49:46.370 --> 00:49:49.497
And I think that's just
a technology problem.

00:49:49.497 --> 00:49:51.580
I think that as soon as
you're strapping something

00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:53.650
big and heavy on
your face, I think

00:49:53.650 --> 00:49:56.800
you've just lost an entire
segment of the world,

00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:59.210
you know, the second
that has to happen.

00:49:59.210 --> 00:50:01.510
And I think until we kind
of overcome that, right?

00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:05.890
Until VR is a part
of my contact lenses,

00:50:05.890 --> 00:50:07.390
then it's always
going to kind of be

00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:09.940
a little bit of a niche thing.

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:14.350
But since I don't do VR,
I'm not the best person

00:50:14.350 --> 00:50:16.360
to answer that question.

00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:17.290
SPEAKER: OK.

00:50:17.290 --> 00:50:19.220
Thank you very much Ron Gilbert.

00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:23.770
[APPLAUSE]
