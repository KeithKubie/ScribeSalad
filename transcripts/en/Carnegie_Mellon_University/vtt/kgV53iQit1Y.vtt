00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:09.910
It is now my distinct pleasure to

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.370
introduce our keynote speaker:

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.440
business leader,

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.720
investment icon,

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:19.850
philanthropist,

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.920
business school alum,

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.220
university trustee

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.250
and Carnegie Mellon champion

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.410
David Alan Tepper.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.379
Oh, I have several pages to read,

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.980
David.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.479
Through his legendary business

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:50.440
savvy

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.450
and investment expertise,

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.140
David has earned an unrivaled

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.969
reputation as one of the most

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.009
successful hedge fund

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.310
managers in the world.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.840
But he's equally well known

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.790
for his passion

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:07.860
for philanthropy.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.969
His belief in the power of higher
education,

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:11.020
and,

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.160
of course,

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:14.569
his exceptional service

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.789
and generosity to his

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.679
alma mater Carnegie Mellon

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:19.520
University.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.649
David grew up not too far from

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.170
here in the Stanton Heights

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.300
neighborhood of Pittsburgh.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.760
The middle of three children,

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.470
I should just add that

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.640
his mother,

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.779
Roberta, is here

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.639
with us. Would you please
acknowledge

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.660
Roberta?

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.199
He went to the University of
Pittsburgh

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.900
for his undergraduate degree in
economics

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.070
before receiving his MBA in 1982

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.079
from our Graduate School of
Industrial

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.490
Administration.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.210
It wasn't called the Tepper School
back there,

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.230
I know.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.820
In 1985,

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.310
he was recruited by Goldman Sachs

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.260
as a credit analyst,

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.940
and, within just six months,

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.490
he became the head trader on

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.280
their newly established high-yield

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:17.520
bond group.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.250
This was the first clue

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.100
that David was a force

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.050
to be reckoned with on Wall Street.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.330
In 1993 — the

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.880
same year the web

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.040
entered the public domain — David

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.830
established Appaloosa Management

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.990
and, over the last 25 years,

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.029
has built an impressively consistent

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.040
record of high returns.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.079
Appaloosa currently has
approximately

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.900
$17 billion under management

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.329
and has yielded gross returns close

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.100
to 40 percent per year

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.080
over the past 20 years.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.820
Through the David

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.280
Tepper Charitable Foundation,

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.199
his philanthropy has expanded
opportunities

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.790
for education,

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.949
helped to fight hunger

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.420
and homelessness,

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.849
and provided much-needed disaster

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.930
relief.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.809
He has generously donated a total

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.090
of $125 million

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:16.980
to Carnegie Mellon University,

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.160
including naming

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.440
and endowing the Tepper School of
Business,

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.840
where he serves on the school's

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.210
Business Board of Advisors.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.310
And in 2013,

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.679
his most recent transformative

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:39.959
gift enabled

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.840
the creation of a state-of-the-art
facility

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:44.655
on the new David A.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.340
Tepper Quadrangle,

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.680
scheduled to open this fall.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.669
At more than 300,000 square

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.409
feet, this building

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.719
will serve as the new home for the
Tepper

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.010
School of Business,

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.410
as well as a major hub

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.060
for collaboration,

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:07.560
innovation,

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.150
creativity

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.670
and entrepreneurship at Carnegie
Mellon.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.630
Tepper Quad will create
unprecedented

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.639
opportunities to break

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:18.780
new barriers

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.030
and to work toward new discoveries,

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.590
new technologies,

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:24.790
new businesses

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.070
and new forms of expression.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.189
As our institution continues to

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.989
grow and build for an evolving

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.070
future,

00:04:33.995 --> 00:04:35.299
the Tepper Quad is the physical

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.579
realization of a new

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.610
model for 21st century research

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.240
and education,

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.009
and it will transform the CMU

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:44.929
experience for generations

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.670
of students to come.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.619
David has given so much

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:50.820
to Carnegie Mellon,

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:52.500
to our nation

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:53.300
and the world,

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.619
and we're delighted to welcome him
back

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.719
to campus to share his

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:58.530
wisdom

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.820
with the Class of 2018.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.759
Please join me in extending a warm

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.370
welcome to David A.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.920
Tepper. David.

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.180
Good morning,

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.440
Class of 2018.

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.940
I have a speech here.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.620
Nice binder.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.000
I think I might read it later,

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.739
but just a couple of observations
first that I

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.409
didn't think about before.

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:31.460
Back

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.070
over there, I was standing next to
Kevin.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.740
He's right there,

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.120
and we were talking.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.400
His voice was shaking.

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.560
My voice was shaking.

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.050
We were both nervous as

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:49.300
heck. I was going to say another
word,

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.129
but I'm told I'm not supposed to say
those words

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.640
today.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:54.729
So, we're coming out

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.659
and we're there

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.759
and we're both kind of like shakey a

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:58.420
little bit,

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.399
and then Kevin starts straightening

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:02.210
up.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.370
He starts getting this strength
about

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:06.330
him, and he says,

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:08.170
"I'm starting to feel it.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:09.810
These are my people.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:11.340
My people."

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.300
He pointed out some friends over
there.

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:17.040
We said hi to his family over there.

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:18.060
His mother, Lauren,

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.519
who told me a couple of stories
about Kevin that I'm not

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:21.600
going to say now.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:25.620
Went up the aisle,

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.300
shaked a few hands there,

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:28.080
said hello to Anne Wall.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.959
Hi, Anne Wall. Yea, good to see you

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.530
over there.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.709
And, you know, Kevin just came up

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:35.250
here

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:36.839
and gave the most fantastic

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:38.460
speech.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:39.055
And I'm thinking, crap.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.319
I cannot be as good because I got
something I got

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.399
to read, and it's twice as long

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:46.350
and I can't just kind of adlib it.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:49.250
And then I was thinking,

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:49.876
well you know what — you

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:53.720
guys, Kevin's family,

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.510
you guys out here, students please.

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:58.550
All you guys here,

00:06:59.060 --> 00:06:59.569
you're my people,

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:00.390
too.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:01.880
OK.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:02.929
You're my people,

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:03.620
too.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.230
You're Carnegie Mellon people,

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:10.070
Carnegie Mellon students,

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:12.230
Carnegie Mellon graduates,

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:13.400
my people.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:14.990
So,

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.979
help me out today.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:16.920
I need help.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.579
So, because I've got to read this,

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:24.050
and I don't know how it's going to
go.

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:25.520
So we'll get to see.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.280
Alright.

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:30.360
Let me start by thanking Farnam

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.200
for that kind introduction, for that
kind introduction.

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:34.720
I've got to get this kind of right
here.

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:36.270
I don't know what I'm going to do.
And for

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.390
his leadership of Carnegie Mellon.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.005
As you know, Farnam, this

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:43.040
place means the world to me.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.560
It really is a treasure.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.300
There's no other university

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.610
that brings together business.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:50.450
Where are you?

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:53.260
Thank you.

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:55.310
The arts.

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:01.070
The humanities.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.650
The sciences.

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:09.730
And the social sciences.

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:11.350
The way CMU does.

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:14.850
You're right there, good to see you.

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.740
Thanks also to my fellow trustees,

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:24.009
to my fellow alumni who are all over
the place

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:24.360
here.

00:08:26.245 --> 00:08:26.680
Engineering?

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.300
I apologize.

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:35.550
They told me not to leave the
podium,

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:37.229
but I don't — I'm sorry about

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:37.680
that. And engineering!

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:39.990
Can I get a hard hat up here?

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:41.439
This thing. Alright.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:48.090
I've now lost my place, but we'll
try.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.020
Thanks also to my fellow trustees,

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:51.310
my fellow alumni,

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:53.640
and most of all to you guys,

00:08:53.596 --> 00:08:54.600
you students,

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.770
and to your parents.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:58.840
A special thanks

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:01.430
to my family and friends who are
here today.

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:03.759
And of course to

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:05.440
my 86-year-old mom.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:06.819
I think she's over there. Hi,

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:08.300
Mom, are you over there someplace?

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:10.089
Mom, where are you?

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:10.140
Mom?

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:12.280
Someplace over there.

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:16.239
I think my mom's a little happy

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:17.240
and proud today.

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:20.439
But my mom sometimes

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:22.370
can be a pain in the butt.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:25.719
And I'm sure your parents can be,

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:26.170
too.

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:28.500
But there is nobody on Earth

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:30.050
I owe more to.

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:32.800
And there's nobody on Earth you owe
more

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:33.700
to than your parents.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:35.140
In life,

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:36.760
in life,

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.610
you should recognize your parents.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.230
So let's take a moment

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:41.950
and thank them.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:54.020
And last but not least,

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:55.610
I want to congratulate

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:57.100
and thank my fellow honorary
doctors.

00:09:58.920 --> 00:09:59.272
Ada.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:00.665
Where are you, Ada? Ada is

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:03.400
a very funny lady.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.460
I got to tell you this, whoever is
going to listen to her later.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.010
A Nobel Prize winner, and she also
has a Nobel Prize.

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:09.580
It's a side thing.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:10.539
Shafi Goldwasser,

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:12.360
a Turing Award winner,

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.089
and a guy I used to watch on TV when

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:15.870
I was younger.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:16.790
Not that much younger.

00:10:18.145 --> 00:10:19.140
An Emmy Award winner,

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:20.770
Ted Danson. You're catching

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:21.430
up to your wife, Ted.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.879
His wife has a couple doctors more

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:28.570
than him, so he's catching up now.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.579
It's amazing what you could find out
by talking to

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.419
people. Good thing

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:34.990
to listen.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:37.990
Now, after the thank yous,

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.040
I think I'm supposed to start a
speech here.

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:42.590
And in preparing,

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.020
I was given advice from professional
speechwriters

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:46.489
and public relations people,

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:46.540
and,

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:48.530
of course,

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:49.430
my children.

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.429
They all told me not to be

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:53.630
too controversial

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.490
and try to be proper.

00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:58.150
Let me apologize

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:00.850
to all of them in advance.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.440
Sorry guys,

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:04.030
not going to happen.

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:09.719
I also prepared by listening to some
of the best

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.550
commencement speeches of all time.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.890
Many were by actors,

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.960
some were by politicians,

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:17.990
all were delivered

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:19.850
with eloquence

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:22.100
and in a professional manner.

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:23.730
To all those

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:26.090
of attendance, to all those in
attendance,

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:28.489
if you were expecting to hear a
professional speech

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:29.270
today,

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:32.120
you may be at the wrong
commencement.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.710
But what I can promise,

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:39.070
what I can promise you is as much
honesty

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.169
and personal life experiences

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:42.550
as I can muster.

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:46.119
I think people's lives are really a
combination

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:47.070
of different lives.

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:48.940
For students,

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.099
it's been a life you had before
college

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:52.300
with your parents,

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:55.120
and the life you had at college now,

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.580
and a life you are about to embark
on.

00:11:58.650 --> 00:11:59.880
I'm sure some of you,

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:01.679
I'm sure some of you have overcome
incredible

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:02.880
adversity.

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.250
All of you have had,

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:07.350
and I can promise you'll all have

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:08.830
challenges,

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:09.960
disappointments

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:12.320
and triumphs.

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:14.130
I'm no different.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.310
On the triumph side,

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:19.590
this has been a hell of a week.

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.670
A kid from the streets of Pittsburgh

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.370
who had to work his way through
college at Pitt

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.740
and grad school at CMU

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:31.020
just got an honorary doctor

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.609
and is giving a commencement speech
at this

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:33.760
university.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:38.580
A kid,

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:41.279
a kid who couldn't afford to

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:42.630
go to an NFL game.

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:46.660
A kid, a

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:50.380
kid who —

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.089
sorry about that — a kid who
couldn't

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:54.770
afford to go to an NFL game

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:56.750
until well into his 20s

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:58.870
is on the verge of getting the NFL's
approval

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.160
to buy the Carolina Panthers.

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:07.410
Not too shabby,

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:10.590
but believe me,

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:12.000
it didn't start out that way.

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:14.520
I grew up,

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:16.709
I grew up in a working-class
neighborhood of Stanton

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:18.270
Heights in the city of Pittsburgh.

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:20.700
We played touch football in the
street

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.550
and tackle football in a nearby
cemetery.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:25.490
We tried to not hit the gravestones.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.260
The cellphone of the day

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:32.000
was mom calling up the street to say

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:32.738
dinner was ready.

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:36.050
My dad, like a lot of dads,

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:37.739
had to work 60-hour weeks just

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:38.770
to make ends meet.

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:42.470
But he taught me a couple of things,

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:44.140
a couple of important lessons.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.030
First, always think about charity

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:48.380
and those less fortunate.

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:50.690
He gave even when my family didn't

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:51.680
have enough.

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:54.840
And another lesson: He used to ask
us,

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:56.310
"Who do you treat better,

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:58.140
the president

00:13:58.680 --> 00:13:59.360
or the garbage man?"

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:02.090
Do you guys know the answer?

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:05.359
Garbage man? I'm talking just
generally

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.400
— not about any specific president
by the way.

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:10.570
Garbage man?

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:13.870
Garbage man,

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.090
garbage man may be the right answer
because somebody's

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.460
got to take your trash every day,

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:18.849
right? And if he doesn't take your
trash,

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:19.560
you're really in trouble.

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:22.000
But actually, the answer is

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:24.450
you treat them both the same.

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:26.350
All men

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:27.430
and women,

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:29.140
and women,

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:31.540
deserve to be treated equally

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.450
and with respect.

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:45.890
Despite these good things about my
dad,

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.020
he had a bad side, too.

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:52.500
He was physically abusive to me.

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:55.290
I'm sure it was a cycle

00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:57.970
that he got from his father,

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:01.030
and his father got from his father.

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:04.230
In my young life,

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.340
there was nothing more terrifying.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.400
There is no greater adversity.

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:13.060
But I prayed to God

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:15.910
that I would never be the same to my
children.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.040
And I'm proud to say,

00:15:19.996 --> 00:15:21.630
in what I view as the

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:23.409
greatest accomplishment of my life,

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:23.460
I

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:28.000
broke that cycle.

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:50.910
Thank you.

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:54.320
Now I'm shaking.

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:58.329
High school was at an

00:15:58.420 --> 00:15:59.860
inner city school called Peabody.

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:01.239
It was about half white

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:02.830
and half African-American.

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:06.000
There really was a lot of tension at
the school,

00:16:05.956 --> 00:16:07.599
between us at the school

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:08.410
back then,

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:10.000
and between the different high
schools.

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.429
Things were so bad between
Westinghouse

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:13.630
High School

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:15.609
and Peabody — I think it's now
called a

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:17.510
Barack Obama High — that

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.350
when we played each other in
football it was

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.249
in front of empty stands to keep

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:22.300
people from fighting.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:24.160
It was rough.

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:27.140
There was actually no

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:27.829
grass on the field.

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:28.820
It was dirt,

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:29.630
rocks,

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:31.850
and they used to oil down the field
to keep the

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:33.050
dust from coming up.

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:34.370
True story.

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:36.730
One field goal post was against the
school.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.500
The other field goal post was
against a fence.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:41.956
If you ran out of the end zone,

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.960
you had real problems.

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:46.950
So I played a little football in
high school,

00:16:46.906 --> 00:16:48.800
and I was also in school plays,

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:50.020
CFA.

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:53.380
But money being short,

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:54.310
I had a work.

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:57.450
My first job application

00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:58.600
was at McDonald's.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.180
I got turned down.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:02.390
I did.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.570
I think it was because I had an
oversized

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:06.410
Afro.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:10.580
Wouldn't be a problem today.

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:14.520
I actually want to take it off,

00:17:14.476 --> 00:17:15.880
it was so frickin' hot up here,

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:16.499
I gotta tell you.

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:19.838
But I did get a job as a short-order
cook

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:20.680
in a deli.

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:22.440
I also sold knives door-to-door.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.210
And I was a union worker in a
bakery.

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.600
After high school, I went to the
University of Pittsburgh.

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:29.940
Where is it? Down there?

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:30.780
There,

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:33.930
where I ate at the "Dirty O," the
Original

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.960
Hot Dog. Anybody, Original Hot Dog
fans?

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:38.220
You like the French fries better,

00:17:38.176 --> 00:17:39.220
or you like the hot dogs better?

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.640
French fries? Raise your hand.

00:17:44.355 --> 00:17:44.405
Hot dogs?

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:48.040
Alright. French fries win the day.

00:17:50.145 --> 00:17:51.429
Ate at the "Dirty O," had a
girlfriend

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:53.380
or two, and worked at the Fine Arts
Library

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.820
and got an honors degree in
economics.

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:59.080
After Pitt, I worked at a bank for a
little

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.879
and then came to Carnegie Mellon for
my

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:01.530
MBA.

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:03.910
Even though it was hard work,

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:05.680
I actually loved this place.

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:08.409
It was also the foundation for
everything

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.360
I've done professionally since then.

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:12.490
This place.

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:14.379
This place gave me the

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:16.120
tools I needed to be successful.

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:17.150
It really did.

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:17.830
I'm not kidding.

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:20.940
Well,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.940
when I graduated I kind of liked
markets

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:23.030
and investments,

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:24.809
so I tried to get a job

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.070
with Goldman Sachs,

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:27.630
but they rejected me.

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:29.300
Didn't get a job there.

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.350
We'll come back to Goldman Sachs a
little later.

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:36.030
So after I got my MBA,

00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:38.030
I made an unusual choice at the
time.

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:40.700
I went to work for Republic Steel.

00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:43.470
That wasn't a great time for steel,

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:45.060
but I knew I would be exposed to a
lot,

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:46.190
and I really wanted to learn.

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:49.559
About three months after

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:51.140
I got to Republic Steel,

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:53.780
they gave a 7 percent
across-the-board

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:55.680
pay cut.

00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:57.930
Pay cut.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:18:59.900
All my business school buddies,

00:18:59.856 --> 00:19:01.800
all my business school friends,

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:03.270
called me up and said,

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:03.950
"Great choice,

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:04.870
Tep!"

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:08.739
In two years, Republic Steel had to
merge

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:10.050
to avoid bankruptcy,

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:12.020
but it was a great choice.

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:14.649
And in those two years that they
were trying to save

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:16.629
the company, Republic did

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:18.309
more finance deals than it had in
its previous

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:19.930
100-year history.

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:21.820
And I learned from each one of them.

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:23.830
There's a lesson here.

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:25.340
In life,

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:26.210
in life,

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:28.460
get all the experience you can.

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:30.859
While you're young, go for the
experience versus

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:31.760
a paycheck.

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:35.359
That kind of experience got me a job
at a

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:37.780
mutual fund specializing in
distressed companies,

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:40.430
and eventually in the door

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.170
of Goldman Sachs,

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:45.400
where in a short time,

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:46.989
because of my previous job
experience

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:48.090
and cutting-edge things, cutting
edge things

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:50.620
I learned at CMU,

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:52.240
I advanced quickly

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:54.310
and became the head trader at
Goldman's junk desk.

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:57.430
That gave me more status than I knew
at that time,

00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:59.800
but what I really wanted was to
become a partner.

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:03.390
I was up for partner for a few times

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:04.290
but never made it.

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:07.529
One of the reasons was I had to

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:09.320
refuse a powerful partner's request.

00:20:09.276 --> 00:20:09.325
The story is this:

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.090
The partner had started a new fund

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:16.590
to invest in bankrupt companies,

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:18.090
and I was supposed to make the
trades for him.

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:20.699
He was also the partner who
controlled our restricted

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:21.540
lists.

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:23.789
That's the list of companies where
you might have some

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:24.660
conflicts

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:26.320
or some sensitive information.

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.129
He asked me to buy a company that he
had

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.340
just removed from the restricted
list

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:32.780
that day, that day.

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:34.800
It didn't seem right.

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:36.430
In fact,

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:37.509
I went to our legal department

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.700
and told them what was going on.

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:42.560
They said it would be okay after a
lot of

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:43.490
back and forth,

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:45.950
but it still didn't feel right to
me.

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:48.100
So, I refused again.

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:50.940
I didn't get fired,

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:53.230
but when I came up for partner,

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:54.190
I got shot down.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.090
And I was incredibly upset.

00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:58.950
But you know what,

00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:00.360
you know what?

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:02.230
It turned out alright.

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:06.530
Because I didn't end up a partner

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:07.790
at Goldman Sachs,

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:09.880
I started my own company 25

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.420
years ago, in 1993,

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:12.310
called Appaloosa

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:15.109
and ended up doing something that
was a lot more

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:15.740
fun

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:18.890
and made my life better in so

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:20.330
many ways.

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:22.670
In life,

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:23.750
in life,

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:25.050
do what's right.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.120
Really, do what's right,

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:28.470
and it won't hurt you.

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:30.990
Just keep your priorities straight.

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:34.250
You know I keep saying in life,

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:36.049
but really, as I said before,

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:37.055
there are many lives.

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.720
I've had an incredible life from
humble beginnings.

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.000
I've raised three great kids,

00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:44.590
have a woman I love.

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:46.989
I've had a successful business
career

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:48.579
and incredible philanthropic

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:50.110
endeavors.

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:52.030
And now I am speaking to you

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:53.890
as a newly named doctorate,

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:55.719
and I am on the verge of being named
an NFL

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:56.390
owner.

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:05.080
You guys,

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:07.509
you guys, you students. Is it OK to
say guys,

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:08.250
students, girls? Girls, guys,

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:09.940
these guys,

00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:10.535
girls, whatever. You

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:13.749
students. Sorry. You had a life

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:14.860
with your parents,

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:16.810
then a life at CMU,

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:19.130
and you're going to have a few more
lives.

00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:20.560
Right now,

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:22.930
like I did, I think right now,

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:24.500
y'all have negative balance sheets.

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:28.610
But you have so much

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:29.600
upside.

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.110
You all have great opportunities
ahead.

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:35.120
Don't let anyone,

00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.830
anyone,

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.230
tell you different.

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:42.200
You live in what was,

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:43.250
is,

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:44.780
and always will be,

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:46.460
the land of opportunity

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:49.279
and the greatest and most generous
country in the

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:49.670
world.

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:54.830
Remember,

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:55.820
remember this.

00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:58.100
Last thing: When all

00:22:58.130 --> 00:22:59.480
you become successful,

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:01.430
remember to give back,

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:02.780
give back.

00:23:04.115 --> 00:23:05.310
God bless all of you.

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:07.600
God bless C-M-U.

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:10.380
And God bless America.

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:11.060
Thank you.
