00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.968
We see that the mean difference in caffeine consumed between freshmen and

00:00:04.968 --> 00:00:10.704
sophomores is 1.018. Therefore, since we're going the opposite way here,

00:00:10.704 --> 00:00:16.630
instead we're doing sophomores minus freshmen, this will be negative 1.018.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.656
It's kind of hard to see the asterisks, but they mean that the difference is

00:00:20.656 --> 00:00:26.199
significant. This does not have an asterisk. So the amount of caffeine consumed

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:31.362
is not significantly different between freshmen and sophomores. For freshmen

00:00:31.362 --> 00:00:35.898
and juniors, you see that the mean difference is negative 2.909 when you're

00:00:35.898 --> 00:00:42.428
going in this direction. Therefore, it's positive 2.909 when you go in the

00:00:42.428 --> 00:00:49.457
opposite direction. This also is not statistically significant. For juniors and

00:00:49.457 --> 00:00:54.917
sophomores, it'll be the opposite of negative 3.927. This also is not

00:00:54.917 --> 00:00:59.092
significant. Here are the rest of the differences, and those that are

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:02.998
significant are the difference between freshmen and seniors, and between

00:01:02.998 --> 00:01:05.731
sophomores and seniors.
