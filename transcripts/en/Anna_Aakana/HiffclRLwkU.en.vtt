00:00:00.259 --> 00:00:00.790
I hate pranks.

00:00:01.447 --> 00:00:03.099
I hate prank videos, prank shows,

00:00:03.099 --> 00:00:03.940
I hate. .

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.629
what pranks have become in our society.

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:07.685
Especially nowadays,

00:00:07.685 --> 00:00:08.751
because people think,

00:00:08.751 --> 00:00:09.944
"It was a prank.

00:00:09.944 --> 00:00:11.446
Not a rape,

00:00:11.446 --> 00:00:13.129
so don't you tell anyone I raped you."

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:14.506
Pranks..have become

00:00:14.506 --> 00:00:15.838
this..excuse

00:00:15.838 --> 00:00:17.291
to act like an asshole.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.247
Look at me, destroying the property

00:00:19.247 --> 00:00:20.128
of this store

00:00:20.128 --> 00:00:23.185
and inconveniencing its employees and customers!

00:00:23.185 --> 00:00:23.750
Look at me,

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:24.476
look at my dick,

00:00:24.476 --> 00:00:27.158
don't look at my camera buddy filmin' all this.

00:00:27.158 --> 00:00:27.900
Look at me,

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.009
trying to get punched in the face for views!

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:31.399
Come on, punch me in the face

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:32.684
so I can get paid!

00:00:33.098 --> 00:00:36.281
They're not silly or harmless or funny anymore, like,

00:00:36.281 --> 00:00:37.629
"WHAT YEAR IS IT?!"

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:39.159
No, now you destroy shit.

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:40.188
Look at me!

00:00:40.188 --> 00:00:41.536
Now you harass people.

00:00:41.536 --> 00:00:42.415
Look at me!

00:00:42.415 --> 00:00:43.612
Now you're an asshole.

00:00:43.612 --> 00:00:45.097
Look at my asshole!

00:00:45.097 --> 00:00:46.216
And I'm not talking about like,

00:00:46.216 --> 00:00:48.567
pranks that you do with your friends and family

00:00:48.567 --> 00:00:50.067
where you know it's all groovy.

00:00:50.067 --> 00:00:52.129
I'm talking about we as a culture,

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:53.277
have come to accept

00:00:53.277 --> 00:00:56.898
that it is okay to humiliate strangers and film them,

00:00:56.898 --> 00:00:59.431
or like vandalize shit, and say it's okay

00:00:59.431 --> 00:01:00.567
because it's a prank.

00:01:00.567 --> 00:01:03.216
Or sexually harass women on the street.

00:01:03.216 --> 00:01:04.568
That, to me,

00:01:04.568 --> 00:01:05.655
is stupid.

00:01:05.655 --> 00:01:06.901
If you're gonna do pranks,

00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:08.245
get creative with it.

00:01:08.245 --> 00:01:09.946
Do something that's really entertaining,

00:01:09.946 --> 00:01:13.308
that's not shocking or mean or offensive.

00:01:13.308 --> 00:01:13.715
You know?

00:01:13.715 --> 00:01:15.490
Do something that you wouldn't mind done to you

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.128
or members of your family.

00:01:17.128 --> 00:01:18.897
Someone asked me to thank today's sponsor

00:01:18.897 --> 00:01:20.868

00:01:20.868 --> 00:01:23.307

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.778

(normal) Mmm.

00:01:58.643 --> 00:02:00.187
