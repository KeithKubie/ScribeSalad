00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.190
So some of the first sort of systematic
experiments were done by these folks,

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:05.130
Wright and Guild in the 20s.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.150
Although the experiments people know
about are a little bit later in the 30s.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.830
They were trying to map this notion of
wavelength to perceived color, right.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.460
So this is what I was
telling you about before,

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.780
where as I change the wavelength.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.680
How much do you have to change the RGB
in order for you to say that they match?

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.560
And they were allowed you to be
able to say two colors are more

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.500
similar to each other
through this process, and

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.560
they define what is called
the CIE color space.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.460
CIE actually stands for commission on
illumination or something in French, and

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.920
that's why its CIE.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.360
So the diagram they came up with
here this is called their xy

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.260
chromaticity diagram.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.180
Couple things to notice and we'll talk
about what x and y are in a minute.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.550
These are the colors at,
as the wavelengths go around, right?

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.570
So you're getting longer and
longer wavelengths, right.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.010
And you get back to here.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.450
So the numbers around the,
these blue numbers around the border,

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.760
those are the wavelengths.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.650
And the middle is what you get
by blending different colors.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:00.870
Now what do we mean by blending?

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.750
Well, what they figured out when they
were looking at people computing

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.930
playing with these RGB lights, and other
things was they came up with a new color

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.870
space that wasn't just RGB, but
that it was going to be a linear

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.850
transform of RGB, but that the prominent
value was going to be called Y.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:19.990
What does Y stand for?

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.975
It stands for luminance.

00:01:20.975 --> 00:01:23.280
Don't ask me why it is?

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.800
Because it's actually
from the XYZ space, and

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.540
the idea is that Y is the luminance.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.475
And so then X and Z were two other
quantities with which you be,

00:01:33.475 --> 00:01:37.760
bet, between X, Z, and
Y you could figure out the color.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.320
And you could represent
a wide range of colors, and

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.010
in fact in this diagram that
I was showing you before.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.610
You notice down here it says x and
y well,

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.430
it was just this x normalized by
the sum and y normalized by the sum.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.620
And so in some sense it's for
sort of a fixed luminance,

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:54.850
it's taking the luminance out of it.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.710
And you can see as you move into the
middle oh, you can't see that at all,

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.640
because it's red drawing on red.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.020
As you come to the middle
you're blending all these and

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.590
that's going to be white and we'll talk,
or gray depending on the luminance and

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.300
we'll talk about that in the minute.
