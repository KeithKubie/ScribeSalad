00:00:08.214 --> 00:00:09.294
Male: Guy walks into a bar.

00:00:09.294 --> 00:00:11.964
Sees the painter friend's
client sitting down with a beer.

00:00:11.964 --> 00:00:14.321
Says, "Friends, you know I just came
from the new Barnet Newman show."

00:00:14.321 --> 00:00:15.793
Client says, "Oh yeah, what do you think?

00:00:15.793 --> 00:00:17.214
I haven't seen it yet."

00:00:17.214 --> 00:00:19.682
Guy says, "You know, it
seemed pretty simple.

00:00:19.682 --> 00:00:22.285
Just a bunch of paintings with lines."

00:00:22.285 --> 00:00:25.570
Client says, "Huh. These paintings,
they all the same color?"

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.613
The guys says, "No."

00:00:27.613 --> 00:00:29.707
"These paintings, they all the same size?"

00:00:29.707 --> 00:00:31.125
Guy says, "No."

00:00:31.125 --> 00:00:33.854
"How about those lines?
They all the same color?

00:00:33.854 --> 00:00:35.567
Same size? Same placement?"

00:00:35.567 --> 00:00:37.413
Guy says, "No."

00:00:37.413 --> 00:00:40.711
Client says, "Sounds pretty
damn complicated to me."

00:00:40.711 --> 00:00:42.619
(piano music)

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:44.462
In old master paintings,
figure ground relationships

00:00:44.462 --> 00:00:49.036
usually referred to the figure,
say the Virgin Mary and the ground.

00:00:49.036 --> 00:00:53.042
Either the gold ground, background
of an Italian panel painting,

00:00:53.042 --> 00:00:56.937
or perhaps the landscape that
is behind the Virgin's throne.

00:00:56.978 --> 00:01:00.271
In Vir Heroicus Sublimis, Newman
has gotten rid of the Virgin.

00:01:00.271 --> 00:01:01.434
He's also gotten rid of the landscape.

00:01:01.434 --> 00:01:04.570
What he's retained, is the
illusionistic relationship

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.790
between forms in space.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.043
Why are these lines vertical?

00:01:08.043 --> 00:01:10.109
It's because when we relate to each other,

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:13.017
we relate to each other,
largely as vertical forms.

00:01:13.017 --> 00:01:14.787
As soon as a mark is made on canvas,

00:01:14.787 --> 00:01:17.796
visually one thing is in front of another.

00:01:17.796 --> 00:01:21.110
Newman referred to these
things, if you will, as zips.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.764
And these zips are vertical lines which

00:01:22.764 --> 00:01:26.039
connect the upper and lower
edges of the painting.

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:28.875
And in this example, the
far left of the painting,

00:01:28.875 --> 00:01:30.130
by looking closely we can actually see

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.956
that the color of the zip
was actually painted first,

00:01:33.956 --> 00:01:36.035
underneath the color of the ground.

00:01:36.035 --> 00:01:38.373
So that you might say,
"Okay, a zip, a line,

00:01:38.373 --> 00:01:40.793
it's certainly in front of the
ground, just like the Virgin

00:01:40.793 --> 00:01:43.620
is in front of the landscape behind her.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.705
However, by looking closely at this zip,

00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:48.585
you can realize that Newman
actually reversed that relationship

00:01:48.585 --> 00:01:50.647
because you're seeing
that that zip is actually

00:01:50.647 --> 00:01:53.581
physically behind the ground.

00:01:53.581 --> 00:01:55.456
So, how did Newman do it?

00:01:55.456 --> 00:01:58.681
Newman almost always used masking
tape to construct his zips.

00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:01.871
Now what you'll notice first, is
that I've painted a base coat.

00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:04.255
A very fleshy pink kind of color.

00:02:04.255 --> 00:02:06.697
One way that Newman made zips was to use

00:02:06.697 --> 00:02:10.042
masking tape over a base coat.

00:02:10.042 --> 00:02:11.585
Now removing the tape you'll
see that the color of the

00:02:11.601 --> 00:02:19.378
entire painting has changed,
except for that area of the zip.

00:02:19.378 --> 00:02:21.681
Shifting gears and looking
at this very dark zip,

00:02:21.681 --> 00:02:23.630
towards the right side of the painting.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.991
This zip because it's so dark
on such a bright painting,

00:02:25.991 --> 00:02:29.790
almost looks like it has a depth,
like it's behind the red ground,

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.871
as if you could look into that space.

00:02:31.871 --> 00:02:34.294
However, approaching the
painting and getting close,

00:02:34.294 --> 00:02:37.667
you realize that Newman has constructed
this zip in a different way.

00:02:37.667 --> 00:02:40.633
So that where that tape
bleeds under the masking tape,

00:02:40.633 --> 00:02:43.964
it's actually going out from
the zip and into the red ground,

00:02:43.964 --> 00:02:48.628
meaning that physically that paint
is actually on top of the red ground.

00:02:48.628 --> 00:02:50.242
What we begin to get a picture of then,

00:02:50.242 --> 00:02:53.376
is that Newman is making all these
subtle adjustments to these zips.

00:02:53.376 --> 00:02:53.960
(piano music)

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.677
None of them are the same.

00:02:54.708 --> 00:02:56.455
And none of them have
the same relationship,

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.319
to the red ground of this painting.

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.996
So when you stand from
a good viewing distance,

00:03:00.012 --> 00:03:02.364
away from the painting,
you realize that these zips

00:03:02.364 --> 00:03:04.879
are competing with each other
for your optical attention.

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.716
So that one zip is quite loud
and hits you in the eye directly,

00:03:07.716 --> 00:03:10.396
while other zips may be just
flickering barely there,

00:03:10.396 --> 00:03:13.196
and are very, very slow to
attract your eye to them.

00:03:13.196 --> 00:03:15.630
In other words, there's
a victorial dynanism.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.074
There's a dynamic interaction
between these zips in space.

00:03:19.074 --> 00:03:23.856
(piano music)

00:03:23.856 --> 00:03:25.912
Newman invited the viewer
to be eighteen inches

00:03:25.912 --> 00:03:27.712
away from the painting.

00:03:27.712 --> 00:03:30.356
And because this painting is
so huge, when you do that,

00:03:30.356 --> 00:03:34.863
your entire field of vision is
dominated by the painting itself.

00:03:34.863 --> 00:03:38.863
(piano music)
