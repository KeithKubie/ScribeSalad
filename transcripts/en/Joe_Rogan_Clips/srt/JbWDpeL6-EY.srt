1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:05,660
The Joe Rogan experience. The mind,
everyone's mind is so different. You know,

2
00:00:05,661 --> 00:00:09,140
there's some people that they
don't have that obsessed mind.

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:13,370
Their mind is like they're,
they're better off like you know,

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,830
running a country store somewhere.

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,550
Just being real friendly to people
that come in and of being a baker,

6
00:00:19,551 --> 00:00:23,890
making good food for folks. Yeah.
That's their thing. That's their calling

7
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:27,430
and that, you know, that's perfectly
fine. It's the people, you know,

8
00:00:27,431 --> 00:00:30,370
people did annoy the fuck out of me.
I love you.

9
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:34,330
What's you annoy the fuck out of
me is people that have no ambition,

10
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,960
no drive whatsoever.
I'm just happy not doing shit.

11
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,680
I always wonder about that.
I always wonder like,

12
00:00:41,681 --> 00:00:43,420
what if I got them when they were little?

13
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:47,590
What if I got a hold of them when they
were little and just introduced them to

14
00:00:47,591 --> 00:00:51,250
exciting things and rewarded them when
they did well and high five them and

15
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:55,590
hugged them. You know what
I mean? Like please change

16
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:02,370
reinforcement of positive goals and
reinforcement of positive experiences.

17
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,020
I think there's some people that just,

18
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:10,240
they never got any of that and everything
was just work and just drudgery and

19
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:14,320
they'd rather just lay around because
that is the alternative to work and

20
00:01:14,321 --> 00:01:15,154
drudgery.

21
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,330
Wow.
Um,

22
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:21,790
I gave a speech and I'm talking about
obsession and being driven and always,

23
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:27,120
and you know, one of the questions
African music guys asked me, so, uh,

24
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,180
what if you know you,
what if you don't want to do anything,

25
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:33,970
you don't have any goals or upsetting?
Uh,

26
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,220
could you tell me how to get one?
And I was like,

27
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,330
fuck,

28
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,550
how do I tell this motherfucker his,
you know,

29
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,840
he wanted to learn. He said, he
born, he went, I want to find a goal,

30
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,220
but I don't know you. I
don't know yet. I don't know.

31
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,510
This is the first time I ever met you
and you're asking me how to give you,

32
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,760
uh,
an obsession or make him give you an I.

33
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:05,610
Only thing I can tell you
is find something. Do you
have anything that you love?

34
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,930
Is there anything that you love? Anything
that you'd like to do then, you know,

35
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,250
start there. Dude. It's
dark, dark. If you, if it,

36
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:19,260
if the person looks back at and you
said, no, not really. Then I'm like,

37
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,290
fuck this dude is irking the fuck you
mean it chose you don't have any fucking

38
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:28,810
thing the job. No. No.

39
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,300
I know some people that have nothing.
Yeah.

40
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,430
Some people it is nothing and there's
nothing absolutely in that, you know,

41
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:41,700
you Pete, I love you guys, but
um, he bugged the fuck out of me,

42
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,790
but fuck and just,

43
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,700
you don't have a cause or go or
nothing that really excites you,

44
00:02:51,151 --> 00:02:54,330
that you really want to make a difference.
You just,

45
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,310
you're happy being blind,

46
00:02:56,311 --> 00:02:59,640
frayed and fucking chance.

47
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,980
I just want to be at cod,
man.

48
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,870
I just worked the fucking car.

49
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:11,110
World needs cogs. Do you think that some
people like here's, here's a thought.

50
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:14,110
Like not everybody can be a
fucking psychopath right now.

51
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,180
Not everybody can be obsessed by things.

52
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:20,650
The world will be too insane and regular
stuff would never get done. Right, right.

53
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,410
You and I aren't getting
regular shit done, you know,

54
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,520
but how about being the best fucking
cock there is breast fucking Cadbury's,

55
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,990
man. I'm going to support the fuck
out of Joe wrote. Oh Man, I don't know

56
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,800
what people, I don't, I would like to,

57
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,130
I think one day we're going to probably
be able to experience this through

58
00:03:41,131 --> 00:03:45,060
technology. I would like to know
how people think. Like I would not,

59
00:03:45,061 --> 00:03:49,290
I would like to know like what is
going on in someone's head when they

60
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:50,460
experienced like some,

61
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:54,720
sometimes things will happen to you
in life and you're just in the worst

62
00:03:54,721 --> 00:03:58,350
possible state of mind when it happens
and sometimes it's the best possible

63
00:03:58,351 --> 00:04:00,990
state of mind and sometimes when
it's the best possible state of mind,

64
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:04,650
something that should be like
catastrophic like eh, it'll be all right.

65
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,480
You know like the person
who did it to you like,

66
00:04:06,481 --> 00:04:08,880
look man I know you didn't mean to do.
It's all right, don't worry about it.

67
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,210
Take it easy. And then you just drop
it and you're like, feel good about it.

68
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:14,790
And then other times like fuck that guy,
I'm going to fucking kill that guy.

69
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,890
And it's all like, it's all in
like how were you wired that day?

70
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,320
Like, what, what's, how
are you coming into it?

71
00:04:22,321 --> 00:04:23,820
You coming into this with a lot of stress,

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,010
you've got a lot of other
bullshit piling up in your life,

73
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:31,110
or are you coming into this fresh off a
heart transplant where you feel love for

74
00:04:31,891 --> 00:04:36,780
the world and you and you have like a
new found enlightenment where you realize

75
00:04:36,781 --> 00:04:38,070
like,
this is all bullshit,

76
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:42,390
all this nonsense and fighting
and arguing for nothing. Like why,

77
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,350
why you do you enjoy,
relax.

78
00:04:46,351 --> 00:04:49,820
I appreciate Matt or distinct,
that's serious.

79
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,980
Have Passion for your
existence and what you enjoy,

80
00:04:52,981 --> 00:04:57,690
what you truly love and your friends
and comradery and fellowship.

81
00:04:57,691 --> 00:04:58,530
That's what it's all about.

82
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,700
Yeah. And I think, uh, you know,

83
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:06,010
they got a whole field,
the psychologists and psychiatrists,

84
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:10,960
that's their fealty and some of the worst,
uh,

85
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:15,990
some of the most mentally challenged
people I've ever met were psychiatrist.

86
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:21,200
I'm like, what though? Have
a theory about that. Yeah,

87
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,660
I have a theory about that.
I've theory about that.

88
00:05:23,661 --> 00:05:25,970
That's very similar in my
theory about cops. You know,

89
00:05:25,971 --> 00:05:28,880
I have a deep respect
for cops need to and uh,

90
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:32,320
I think it's an insanely difficult job.
Just same,

91
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,430
same feeling I have for soldiers.

92
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:39,790
Like you cannot expect someone to
just do that with no guidance and no,

93
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:45,140
no, you, you have to have an appreciation
for the stress they go through.

94
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,800
Every time a cop pull somebody over, this
might be the last moment of their life.

95
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,310
Every time they come to that window and
it's tinted and they don't know who the

96
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:54,950
fuck is in there and what kind
of warrant that guy might have.

97
00:05:54,951 --> 00:05:56,360
They don't have any idea.

98
00:05:56,361 --> 00:06:00,200
And we've seen videos online and cops
getting shot and people getting killed.

99
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:04,100
It fucking happens. And there everyone
they're dealing with is lying to them.

100
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:07,460
Everyone, they're dealing with
this. If you're a psychiatrist,

101
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,570
every day you're dealing with
people who are fucked every day.

102
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,850
Everyone's fucked up.
Everyone's in some,

103
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,420
some of their fucked up is nonsense and
you just want to grab them and shake

104
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:20,540
them by the call and get your
fucking shit together. Man,

105
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,320
the fuck is wrong with you. Come on.
You know there's something wrong.

106
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,680
Stop doing what you're doing stupid.
But you can't even say that.

107
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,360
So you have to go. So Mike, um,
uh, you know, uh, you're, you're,

108
00:06:32,361 --> 00:06:34,100
you're still getting
tied up by that woman.

109
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:38,240
She still kicks in the balls because he
shouldn't have people who are into like,

110
00:06:38,241 --> 00:06:41,540
if you imagine every day you
showing up and everyone's nuts,

111
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,290
everyone you work with, you know,
I'm very fortunate. I show up here,

112
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:48,740
I get to talk to nice people like you
hang out with great people like Jamie and

113
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,530
every, everyone's fun here. It's all nice.

114
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,340
My experiences on a daily
basis are very mostly positive.

115
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:58,730
I go to the comedy store, hang out with
comedians. I did you do to hang on.

116
00:06:58,731 --> 00:07:02,120
What'd you do to guys?
It's fun experiences or good experiences.

117
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,410
Psychiatrists are just dealing
with crazy bucks all day long.

118
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,530
When I was, um, when I
was briefly in college,

119
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,650
one of the things that I was concentrating
on with psychology because I was

120
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:17,030
trying to find out what can,

121
00:07:17,031 --> 00:07:21,050
I knew there was times when I fought and
I was very confident and I knew there

122
00:07:21,051 --> 00:07:24,720
was times that her father was a nervous
wreck. And I was like, why? What is that?

123
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:29,060
That feeling of nerves were you scared
is very compromising. It fucks me up.

124
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:33,360
Performance. Yeah. I mean look, you,
you might get hit, you might lose,

125
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:36,740
you could happen. But to
dwell on that, it's crippling.

126
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,890
Like it gotta be able to
accept those consequences,

127
00:07:39,891 --> 00:07:42,320
but you also have to not dwell.
So they have to be zen.

128
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:45,800
And so I was reading a lot of
psychology books and philosophy books,

129
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,560
a lot of Samurai books.
And um,

130
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:52,730
but one thing I realized in talking to
people that were like psychologist or

131
00:07:52,731 --> 00:07:53,840
psychology majors,

132
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:58,670
like you're dealing with
fucked up people all the time,

133
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,840
especially psychiatrists. Oh, fuck people.

134
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,760
And then they're prescribing them drugs
like, hey, go get out. I gotta take this.

135
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,870
We'll get numbers.
Buddies. Like I was crazy.

136
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:13,890
He was crazy. Yeah. Very nice
cabinets. I think you get crazy. Yeah.

137
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,300
I think you get crazy dealing with all
those people all the time too, man. Yeah.

138
00:08:17,301 --> 00:08:19,340
I mean,
if your day is blocked off,

139
00:08:19,341 --> 00:08:22,250
you have your secretary and then
you've got patients all day long.

140
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:26,000
They're out of their fucking minds.
Very good point.

141
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,190
It's a terrible diet,
you know?
