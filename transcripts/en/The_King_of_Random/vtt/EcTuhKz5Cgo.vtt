00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.920
I was up guys hang out with my wife this week

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.489
We're on a road trip and we stopped off in Oregon at a hotel just to spend the night

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.220
And we brought with us one of these little investigative tools

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.869
[this] is a UV flashlight that I used with my cousin with the glowing scorpions project

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.000
But Uv light also helps identify bodily fluids so we thought it might be fun tonight

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.539
Just to shine the light around our room and see what kind of things we could dig up

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.129
Maybe things that we don't want to find I don't know because we haven't actually slept in our beds yet. Go ahead

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.849
Let's light up the bed. My wife's got this little black light flashlight here

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.959
What this does is it illuminates human fluids should we take a look at the bed?

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:41.309
Pretty good all right one point for best western let's peel back the sheets and see if we can find anything here

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.869
Well, let's see what's here which those just look like they're marks of some kind

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.000
This is kind of a good sign guys

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.340
They're not seeing anything fluorescing nothing really off-putting the bed is pretty clean let's go check out the bathroom. Oh

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.210
Look, there's a little spot the government's by the sink there [only] that's toothpaste or something of that nature on the faucet you can see

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.860
Like Little remnants of the white towel that was used to wipe it down looking down the floor though

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.119
You can see it's actually pretty clean. I don't see many spots so kudos to the cleaners here

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.629
So the wall looks completely clean and then we turn off [the] lights [add] a little uv light and now we can see there are

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.220
Actually spots everywhere. [oh] my goodness look at the light switch. That's pretty gross

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.350
There's all kinds of stuff everywhere

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.299
So wow how dirty your light switches and you're touching those things all the time? Huh? [I] [think] [we'll] be washing those down

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.740
See it looks relatively normal put the light [on] it looks pretty gross

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.189
normal Gross wow it all had

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:42.929
Right here's the clean remote and if we do an inspection on that nothing really too concerning the linens all look pretty good

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.119
I'm actually going to be pretty confident sleeping my bed tonight

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.849
[that] doesn't look bad at all so they must really wash these things

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.229
[it] makes me wonder what the difference [would] be if we got a cheap little motel room, okay?

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.199
So guys update we were traveling home, and we stopped over here at this little motel the best western passed our test with flying colors

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.369
So we wondered what a motel would be like in contrast. Let's go check it out

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:03.299
All right

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.118
[so] this is our first time seeing this guy's we have no idea what to expect so let me just get this thing turned on

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.640
boom oh

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.149
Wow, look at that. You can see right behind the coffee maker again the walls are really dirty. It's amazing

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.000
How much stuff is on the walls apparently that cleaners don't know about so apparently they allow pets in this motel

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.959
And you can see by sweeping the UV light there's a spot right there looks like maybe some

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.999
[mater] right back over here by the door as well in the corner something was cleaned up there at the bed

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.979
That's glow in there. Just because there's a rip in the seam that looks pretty clean on the top. You know let's see bad

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.899
He's like very clean as well. It's good news. All right. Well can sleep in peace. You know for a motel

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:50.130
I'm actually pretty impressed out of the light switches look not too bad actually relatively clean time to see the bathroom

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.239
Do we have in here?

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.359
[it] seems like in most of these hotels we've been to it's the walls that get neglected look down here

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.360
There's quite a bit of gunk on that wall there

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.709
when you turn the light on

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.350
Can tell [alright] looks like we got a fairly decent motel [looks] pretty clean, okay?

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.850
So it's a week later, and I've just checked into a really expensive hotel here in San Francisco

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.100
It's about four times as expensive as any of the hotels

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.429
We're at earlier, and you can see it's quite a bit smaller as well

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.910
So now I am really curious to know how does a really posh

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.720
Hotel hold up compared to just a little motel like we were in the other day

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.809
I brought my UV flashlights, so let's close the blinds and check it out

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.839
It is dark in here as we can starting over in the bed area and they make all the bed sheets white

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:40.519
Very hard actually to pick up anything on white sheets [cuz] whites about as reflective to get so far so good though, huh?

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.709
Oh look on the pillow there who knows what that is

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:48.949
but [that] just popped into view even with the daylight on it if you shine in the UV light those spots appear three spots of

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.899
Who knows what and who knows if it's been cleaned or not, but I probably won't be using that pillow tonight all right now

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.390
here's a fun one the remote control do we even want to see this you can see it's covered in little flecks all over the

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.929
Place I'm assuming that's from the cotton rag that they used to wipe it down

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.329
So maybe they do clean the remotes that's reassuring

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:10.249
Could be pretty nasty if they didn't look at that right there on the floor that looks kind of nasty

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.629
[I] just popped up out of nowhere. We've got hairs. We've got bits of fluff

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.430
There's quite a bit of dirt in there as well

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:22.039
It doesn't look like it's a very well taken care of there is something on that card, and I don't know what it is

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:28.399
But you can see how it starts glowing under the light there well look at that water for six dollars and [fifty] cents

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.970
Per bottle wow that's pretty grimy. Look at those buttons guys the buttons on the thermostat

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:40.609
[oh], wow look at this by the entryway here. There's all kinds of [nasty] stuff in the carpet there. It almost looks like

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.609
Something took a leak on the carpet something spilled for sure maybe vomit maybe somebody threw up here

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.010
There's like little trails [within] here all right

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.749
Let's check out the bathroom next here's what the light switch looks like with the light on doesn't really look that bad

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.539
[I] mean everything in general looks pretty nice

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.679
The Walls here. Oh man, just like every hotel

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.829
We've been to it almost [looks] [like] toothpaste residue

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:09.380
Or some kind of fluid looking at the side of the toilet here looks relatively clean right doesn't look too [bad]

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.899
But you put a uv light [on] it and all the dirt and grime jumps right out at you this corner is hideous

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:17.069
With a dirty that is

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:23.898
Amazing so disgusting under Uv light have to say this is one of the dirtiest hotels we've been [at] yet

00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:27.078
And it's four times the price. So there you have a guys

00:05:27.079 --> 00:05:30.559
There's a little more insight into your living conditions when you're away from home

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:36.259
And if you want to get one of these Uv flashlights off the internet for about 20 bucks [try] doing a tour of the hotel

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:40.458
Room the motel room or if you're feeling really brave try doing a tour of your own house in the dark

00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:42.738
That's a very eye-opening experience anyway

00:05:42.739 --> 00:05:46.759
Thanks for joining me for this experiment guys, and I'll be looking for you in the next video. Talk to you then
