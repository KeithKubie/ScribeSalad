00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:14.160
Marie Curie and her husband, Pierre, were
no strangers to the press.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.070
In 1903, the pair won a Nobel Prize “in
recognition of the extraordinary services

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.130
they have rendered by their joint researches
on the radiation phenomena discovered by Professor

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.770
Henri Becquerel”.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.510
Their relationship was a happy one, with each
of them being on an even intellectual footing

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.540
with the other.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.750
They celebrated their Nobel Prize and continued
their work.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.970
But after a few years, tragedy struck.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.190
In 1906, Curie’s beloved husband died in
an accident.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.789
In the afternoon on April 19, Pierre was crossing
the street in heavy rain when he was run over

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:47.679
by a horse-drawn carriage that was carrying
six tons of military uniforms.

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:49.910
Needless to say, he was killed instantly.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.010
Though she was heartbroken, she refused the
pension that the French government offered

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.410
her, saying she could support herself and
her children just fine.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.739
In fact, she went back to work soon after
Pierre’s death and even took up her husband’s

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:02.069
academic post.

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:03.069
Curie wrote,

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:05.180
Crushed by the blow, I did not feel able to
face the future.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.140
I could not forget, however, what my husband
used sometimes to say, that, even deprived

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.450
of him, I ought to continue my work.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.350
It probably isn’t surprising that Curie
eventually moved on in other ways, too.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.430
She was only 38 years old when she was made
a widow, after all.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.189
Soon, she set her sights on Paul Langevin,
her husband’s former student.

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.890
A brilliant man just as committed to science
as Pierre was, he would be able to fill the

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.530
void left by her deceased husband.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.270
Plus, he was a good-looking and had a “thriving
moustache.”

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.649
What wasn’t to like?

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:36.170
There was only one problem: he was already
married.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.740
Nevertheless, Curie and Langevin wrapped themselves
up in a steamy affair.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.740
Langevin was no stranger to extramarital relations;
his marriage wasn’t a happy one, with his

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.340
wife reportedly once hitting him over the
head with a bottle.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.530
(Although given his many affairs, perhaps
he deserved it.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:51.530
;-))

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.479
She’d been well aware of his previous forays
with other women, but something about Curie

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.750
enraged her.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.109
So, when Madame Langevin found out that her
husband and his mistress had set up an apartment

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:02.929
where they could meet in private, she had
someone break in.

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:07.159
The thief took intimate letters from the house,
and Madame Langevin threatened to expose the

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.149
affair to the press if it didn’t stop.

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.140
The affair either continued or Madame Langevin
went back on her word.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.770
Three days before Marie Curie won a second
Nobel Prize, Madame Langevin leaked the letters

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.319
to the press, declaring that she wanted money
and the custody of the Langevin children.

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.959
The newspapers went wild for the story.

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.010
They painted Curie as a seductress who had
lured a family man away from his good French

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.659
wife and children.

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:34.599
It was an easy thing, given the prejudices
of the day—Curie was a foreigner, being

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.390
a native of Poland, and (they inaccurately
reported) a Jew.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.500
The papers started rumours that the affair
had started when Pierre was still alive.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.750
These allegations were also untrue, but it
sullied Curie’s name enough that the Nobel

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.250
Committee asked her to stay in France rather
than travel to Sweden to accept her award.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.670
They shuddered to think what would come of
an adulteress rubbing shoulders with the King

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:55.860
of Sweden himself!

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.401
Albert Einstein, on the other hand, jumped
to Curie’s defense, saying she ought to

00:02:59.401 --> 00:03:01.299
come to Sweden regardless of the allegations.

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.540
I am convinced that you [should] continue
to hold this riffraff in contempt…if the

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.319
rabble continues to be occupied with you,
simply stop reading that drivel.

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.769
Leave it to the vipers it was fabricated for.

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.500
Meanwhile, there was not just one, but two
duels fought over the incident.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.480
One was fought between two editors of rival
papers: M. Chervet of the Gil Blas and Leon

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.790
Daudet of L’action Francaise.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.540
Their argument was about the merits of Madame
Langevin’s charges.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.750
The duel was fought with swords, and after
“several fierce bouts,” Daudet was injured

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.420
and the two reconciled.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.430
The other duel was fought between Paul Langevin
and Gustave Tery, a journalist who had called

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.989
him a “boor and a coward.”

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.900
Langevin didn’t take kindly to the insult
and demanded a duel be fought with pistols.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.629
Elaborate preparations took place, but the
duel resulted in nothing—Tery refused to

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:49.530
shoot on the grounds that he did not want
to rid France of one of its greatest minds,

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.380
and Langevin declared that he wasn’t an
assassin and put his gun down, too.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.500
The publicity effectively ended the affair.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.280
Langevin and his wife were able to settle
their differences outside of court and later

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.530
reconciled, though Langevin went on to father
an illegitimate child with his secretary.

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.360
Curie travelled to Sweden against the advice
of the committee and accepted her second Nobel

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.360
Prize.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.280
Afterwards, she sat down to an eleven-course
meal with the King of Sweden which went smoothly.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.450
She was the first person—man or woman—to
win a Nobel Prize twice.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.989
Unfortunately, she paid for her work with
her life.

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:25.860
In 1934, she succumbed to leukemia, the result
of prolonged exposure to ionizing radiation.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.440
Her work notes, even today, are still too
radioactive to handle without proper protection.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.229
hough Curie and Langevin never got back together,
it wasn’t the end of Curie-Langevin relations.

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:39.280
Curie’s granddaughter, Helene Joliot-Curie,
ended up marrying Langevin’s grandson Michel.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.880
It was probably enough to put Grandma Langevin’s
feet in the grave if they weren’t there

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.880
already.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.340
Not only did Marie Curie win two Nobel Prizes,
but her family has been the recipient of five

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.230
total Nobel Prizes.

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.850
She won two, her husband, Pierre Curie, won
one.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.360
Her daughter, Irène Joliot-Curie, won the
Chemistry Prize in 1935 with her husband.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:37.560
Her second daughter was also the director
of UNICEF when it won the Nobel Peace Prize

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.949
in 1965.
