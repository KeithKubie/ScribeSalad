do something unless you you really care

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:15.549 align:start position:0%
about something and I think that's a way
 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:17.999 align:start position:0%
about something and I think that's a way
for<00:00:15.730><c> science</c><00:00:16.240><c> and</c><00:00:16.390><c> for</c><00:00:16.930><c> academics</c><00:00:17.560><c> and</c><00:00:17.800><c> for</c>

00:00:21.569 --> 00:00:21.579 align:start position:0%
friends and I think most importantly
 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:23.819 align:start position:0%
friends and I think most importantly
they<00:00:22.390><c> just</c><00:00:22.630><c> needs</c><00:00:22.900><c> to</c><00:00:23.020><c> be</c><00:00:23.079><c> some</c><00:00:23.500><c> kind</c><00:00:23.680><c> of</c>

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:23.829 align:start position:0%
they just needs to be some kind of
 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:25.859 align:start position:0%
they just needs to be some kind of
functional<00:00:24.489><c> connection</c><00:00:25.180><c> that</c><00:00:25.420><c> once</c><00:00:25.660><c> you</c><00:00:25.750><c> hit</c>

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 align:start position:0%
functional connection that once you hit
 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.380 align:start position:0%
functional connection that once you hit
something<00:00:26.140><c> you</c><00:00:26.769><c> know</c><00:00:27.039><c> it</c><00:00:27.429><c> just</c><00:00:27.730><c> kind</c><00:00:28.269><c> of</c>

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 align:start position:0%
something you know it just kind of
 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.630 align:start position:0%
something you know it just kind of
clicks<00:00:28.720><c> and</c><00:00:28.960><c> that</c><00:00:29.949><c> you</c><00:00:30.099><c> need</c><00:00:30.250><c> to</c><00:00:30.400><c> aggressively</c>

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 align:start position:0%
clicks and that you need to aggressively
 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
clicks and that you need to aggressively
pursue<00:00:31.000><c> that</c><00:00:31.660><c> a</c><00:00:31.720><c> lot</c><00:00:31.990><c> so</c><00:00:32.559><c> I</c><00:00:32.589><c> was</c><00:00:32.920><c> very</c>

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:33.129 align:start position:0%
pursue that a lot so I was very
 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.060 align:start position:0%
pursue that a lot so I was very
fortuitous<00:00:34.120><c> that</c><00:00:34.720><c> my</c><00:00:35.290><c> first</c><00:00:35.470><c> experience</c><00:00:35.949><c> was</c>

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 align:start position:0%
fortuitous that my first experience was
 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.650 align:start position:0%
fortuitous that my first experience was
science<00:00:36.400><c> with</c><00:00:36.519><c> stem</c><00:00:36.699><c> cells</c><00:00:36.730><c> and</c><00:00:37.300><c> that</c><00:00:37.449><c> was</c>

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 align:start position:0%
science with stem cells and that was
 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.479 align:start position:0%
science with stem cells and that was
just<00:00:37.900><c> a</c><00:00:38.110><c> very</c><00:00:38.140><c> natural</c><00:00:38.470><c> fit</c><00:00:38.949><c> and</c><00:00:39.690><c> I</c><00:00:40.690><c> think</c><00:00:40.900><c> that</c>

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 align:start position:0%
just a very natural fit and I think that
 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.820 align:start position:0%
just a very natural fit and I think that
the<00:00:42.489><c> first</c><00:00:42.729><c> real</c><00:00:43.089><c> at</c><00:00:43.360><c> really</c><00:00:44.019><c> really</c><00:00:44.350><c> big</c><00:00:44.559><c> step</c>

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:44.830 align:start position:0%
the first real at really really big step
 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.170 align:start position:0%
the first real at really really big step
is<00:00:45.010><c> just</c><00:00:45.190><c> finding</c><00:00:45.430><c> something</c><00:00:45.640><c> you</c><00:00:45.790><c> believe</c><00:00:46.150><c> in</c>

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 align:start position:0%
is just finding something you believe in
 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
is just finding something you believe in
and<00:00:46.510><c> then</c><00:00:47.140><c> after</c><00:00:47.710><c> that</c><00:00:48.000><c> you</c><00:00:49.000><c> can</c><00:00:49.420><c> definitely</c>

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 align:start position:0%
and then after that you can definitely
 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.699 align:start position:0%
and then after that you can definitely
make<00:00:50.619><c> things</c><00:00:51.010><c> happen</c>
