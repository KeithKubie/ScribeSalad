00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.080
Listing education is your next step
in building your master resume.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.200
An important thing to note about
the education section, is that it can

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.880
include a variety of forms beyond
the traditional college experience.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.650
Just be sure to present this in an
organized way on your targeted resume.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.335
Within the education section,
include any degrees,

00:00:17.335 --> 00:00:20.150
certificates, credential, etc.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.200
Also note, high school education
need not be included on your resume

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.670
after college.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.950
When organizing this information,
organize the category,

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.560
university degrees,
certificates, courses, workshops.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.140
This helps visually
organize your experience.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.080
Within each subheading, place the most
recent experience at the top.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.070
It might be helpful to note that you
don't need to include the specific years

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.280
that you graduated.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.480
You didn't have to include a GPA, but
if you've got a great GPA, a 3.5 or

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.260
above, for example, you can.
