00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.930
My word, Holmes...

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.960
it is staggering.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.110
I am not unacquainted with the

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.650
progress of modern scholarship, but

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:58.000
this collection is enormous. What a 
treasure trove of our culture, ha? 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.410
Yes, yes, Watson,

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.410
but come along my good fellow, we have
work to do.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.580
Here, what is there for us here?

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.010
Crime, of course. Crime?

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.400
Here? In the library?

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.290
This library and every library, Watson.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.210
Serious crime... murder.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.140
Murder? 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.140
Good heavens, Holmes,

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.910
who is being murdered? 
The books, Watson, the books. Forgive me.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.010
Perhaps murder is too a strong a word

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.360
but the books are being killed... destroyed.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.200
Destroyed? I say, Holmes,

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.000
that's a serious charge. 
Are you certain of this?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.090
Very certain. 
It's happening now, in fact.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.210
Countless numbers of books

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.910
are being destroyed every single day.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.000
That's terrible.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.690
Who would want to do such a thing?

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.720
To discover that, Watson,
is why we are here. Come...

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.720
let us go to the scene of the crime.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:06.939
Good heavens!

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.049
It's even worse than I suspected.

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:11.130
What is Holmes?

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.700
There's nothing here but these shelves of books. 
I don't see any cause for your alarm. 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.529
I know. Neither you nor most other
people. That's part of the problem.

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:21.140
Say, Holmes, here...

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.620
here's one that should interest you. Oh!

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.239
Goodness!
Allow me Watson.

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:34.879
Ah yes. A monograph

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.810
on alkaline toxicology.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.339
Perhaps it could be of use to me,

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:43.330
even after your assault on it.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.899
Assault, really, Holmes I didn't...
Yes, Watson, I fear that it is so.

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:49.620
Not with intent, of course,

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.089
but assault it you did nevertheless

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:55.159
just as those to whom this collection is entrusted

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:58.069
also wreak havoc upon these many volumes.

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:59.389
And yet

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.299
prevention of such damage is simplicity itself

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.200
if those who work with books

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.179
would only adhere to an axiom of mine.

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:10.290
Which one is that, Holmes?

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.290
The little things

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.609
are infinitely the most important

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:19.559
and so it is with preservation.

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:22.599
Let's look into the matter more closely.

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:24.799
This section of books,

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.000
what do you deduce from it, Watson? 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.079
Well, it all looks normal to me. But I

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.359
shouldn't want to use it again for fear of, ha,

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.429
repeating my offense. 
Understandable.

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:42.369
But it is not only you who has 
created the problem.

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:43.629
Observe the shelves.

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:45.629
This shelf which your first attacked,

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:50.379
the books are simply not supported properly
in an upright position.

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:53.029
Now

00:03:55.029 --> 00:03:57.109
the shelving is correct.

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:01.479
Each book supported vertically by its
neighboring volume and

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:03.619
the bookend.

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:05.489
Notice they are snug but

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:06.449
loose enough

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:08.199
to allow

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.659
removal

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:10.829
of a volume.

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:12.030
Yes I see.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:18.699
Now.. what about
this next shelf, Watson?

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:19.299
Well

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.000
these books certainly won't fall over 
as the others did.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.189
It's true, but the shelf is too tight.

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:28.139
The bookend has been used to disadvantage.

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:29.819
A slight loosening

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:33.190
and the book can be removed without damage.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.240
And this shelf

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.240
is a potential disaster.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.219
The books are just perched there precariously.

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:42.789
But by returning them

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:44.800
to their correct position

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.700
they're now properly supported

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:47.550
and present

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.550
neither hazard nor hindrance to removal.

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:10.250
This poor victim

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.379
has been crammed into a space too small.

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:18.379
It needs to be shelved the long way in
to save it from permanent damage. 

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:22.999
Hmm, I'll do it Holmes. 
Thank you, Watson, but it must go in spine down.

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:26.460
Notice the volume next to it shelved
fore-edge down.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.889
See how gravity pulls the textblock out of its case?

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:33.300
If a volume is too tall to be shelved vertically

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.810
shelve it spine down

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:37.449
so

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:39.020
the textblock

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.369
does not pull away from the cover.

00:05:43.369 --> 00:05:47.179
Holmes, this book has been shelved incorrectly.

00:05:47.179 --> 00:05:51.680
Yes, Watson, I also observed her doing so.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.610
It's obvious the problem can be solved merely

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.120
by teaching people how to

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.120
properly place books back on the shelves.

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:07.120
That's only the half of it my good man.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.759
Correct shelving and storage are crucial

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:13.749
but one must allow for actual
careful handling of books.

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:16.369
Where is that toxicology tome?

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:20.289
Here it is. The one with the recently torn headcap.

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:22.309
No need to look abashed, Watson.

00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:25.060
If proper shelving techniques have been applied

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.400
then this simple procedure can be followed

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.800
to remove the desired volume.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:30.730
Gently push

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:34.289
the volumes on either side back,

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:39.039
grasp the book you want firmly at the center of
the spine and pull it from the shelf,

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:41.470
thus no damaging strain is exerted

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:42.660
on the weaker

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.099
vulnerable portions of the binding.

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:46.650
After removal, of course,

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.459
the empty spaces is closed up by pushing
the bookend snug

00:06:50.459 --> 00:06:52.240
to maintain vertical support

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.619
for the remaining volumes on the shelf.

00:06:55.619 --> 00:06:58.039
How did you know all that, Holmes?

00:06:58.039 --> 00:06:59.669
Elementary, my dear Watson,

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:02.839
elementary.

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:05.530
But, what if the books are packed
a little too tightly

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:09.560
or the desired volume is 
at the end of the shelf?

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:15.389
How can the volume be removed without causing
damage to the cover or binding structure?

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:16.930
A moment, Holmes.

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:22.239
Let me see... perhaps...

00:07:22.239 --> 00:07:22.859
perhaps...

00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:24.509
what if one were to

00:07:24.509 --> 00:07:25.880
press down on the pages

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.349
on the top of the book,

00:07:28.349 --> 00:07:30.339
tilt the book forward

00:07:30.339 --> 00:07:35.409
and then grasp the spine?

00:07:35.409 --> 00:07:37.090
That's capital, Watson.

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:38.499
You surpassed yourself.

00:07:38.499 --> 00:07:40.930
Yes, indeed this alternative method

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:45.369
will serve the same protective function 
for safe removal of books.

00:07:45.369 --> 00:07:47.169
You see, preservation

00:07:47.169 --> 00:07:50.169
is quite simple.

00:07:54.399 --> 00:07:55.340
And now, Watson

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.160
please be good enough to hand me 

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.710
that volume up there.

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:03.039
This one?
Yes, that large folio volume.

00:08:05.039 --> 00:08:10.789
Careful. All the right procedures but you didn't
give yourself an opportunity to apply them.

00:08:10.789 --> 00:08:16.599
A step stool will give you an even chance
to remove the volume and maintain support

00:08:16.599 --> 00:08:20.379
for those that remain.

00:08:20.379 --> 00:08:22.059
Seems like a good idea when

00:08:22.059 --> 00:08:27.719
reshelving a volume as well.

00:08:27.719 --> 00:08:29.319
Well, is our...

00:08:29.319 --> 00:08:31.610
work here finished then?

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:32.120
Almost.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.410
There still remain several secondary problems.

00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:39.730
Let us aim toward that area, there.

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:42.140
I say, Holmes,

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:46.660
this one looks as though the same chap loaded it 
as did the bookshelves back there.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:50.000
Indeed, and I daresay it will topple over
at some point

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.610
it's so badly loaded.

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:57.140
It should have been loaded using the same
principles I outlined for regular shelves

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:58.290
just as has been done

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.910
with this one.
Yes.

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:05.360
Aha!

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.800
What, Holmes? What is it?

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.230
Yet another dangerous condition.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:10.110
Where, Holmes? 

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:11.040
These shelves

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.500
look properly done.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:19.040
Here. This empty soda can and the remains 
of a meal scattered across the desk.

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:22.810
Oh, really, Holmes, when I was in medical school sometimes
we'd spent hours in library. I imagine it's the

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:28.170
same thing with these students here. One of them
just didn't have time to go out for a proper dinner.

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:29.819
Good heavens! I'm not

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:31.390
totally without feelings

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:35.020
but preservation demands constant vigilance.

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:39.639
It may not be possible to prevent the 
deterioration caused by

00:09:39.639 --> 00:09:41.120
environmental conditions,

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.989
pollution or other factors beyond the 
library's control,

00:09:43.989 --> 00:09:48.630
but those conditions that can be controlled
must be controlled.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:49.189
Yes.

00:09:49.189 --> 00:09:53.720
I can sympathize with wanting to satisfy one's
hunger pangs

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:57.110
but not with the damage caused by doing so.

00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:01.459
Oh, really, Holmes it maybe a little
untidy but...

00:10:01.459 --> 00:10:03.910
Watson, eating and drinking in the stacks

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:07.890
brings bugs and roaches just as surely as ants
follow a picnic

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:10.769
and once insects are here in the stacks

00:10:10.769 --> 00:10:14.440
the next meal is the paper and the glue in
the books,

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:18.240
totally destroying whatever they attack. Here...

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:22.240
an example of such damage.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.590
And look at that fellow over there.

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:31.920
Not only has he brought his beverage
into the stacks,

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.130
if he spills it

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:37.270
the book will be soaked
and probably destroyed

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:40.200
even if the liquid is only water.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:45.770
This library employee should be practicing
proper preservation techniques.

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:46.990
How's that, Holmes?

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:49.679
By reminding anyone she sees

00:10:49.679 --> 00:10:52.510
eating or drinking in the stacks

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:59.020
to please delay their refreshment in order to help
preserve the very books they are here perusing.

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:02.460
That's the best kind of preservation, Watson,

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:07.670
not only preventing the sorts of damage caused
by improper shelving and book handling,

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:08.879
but also

00:11:08.879 --> 00:11:15.150
trying to discourage the library's users
from causing damage by their carelessness. Here,

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:19.150
let me show you how simple that can be.

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:27.780
Even here, Watson,

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:32.520
a little attention to preservation can 
eliminate yet another source of damage to

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:33.810
the books.

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:35.270
Here, Holmes? 

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:37.130
But all I see is

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:40.780
people returning books to the library.
Precisely,

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:45.880
and some of those books may spend months
in the stacks before they see the light again.

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:47.180
A paper clip

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:47.800
left in a book

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:51.850
for that length of time can rust and 
permanently mark the pages,

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:53.560
as can a rubber band or 

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.209
some other bookmark

00:11:55.209 --> 00:11:57.210
left too long in one place.

00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:58.950
But if the circulation clerk

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:01.360
were to make a brief observation

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.800
of each volume as it is returned

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.110
and remove the

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:06.150
offending items,

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:10.610
the eventual damage would be prevented.

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:16.080
Preservation is as simple as even this.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.000
But enough of that old boy.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
We can leave now.

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:29.190
But Holmes, aren't we going to solve this crime?

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:31.130
We already have, Watson.

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:33.880
I know who is killing the books.

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.110
Who, Holmes? Who?

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:40.210
Everyone, Watson.
The people who use the library

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:42.800
and the people who work in the library.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.610
All people who come in contact with books

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:47.830
but who fail to give sufficient

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:50.330
thought to the consequences of their actions.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.540
That's the problem.

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:55.280
What's the solution?

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:58.570
Preservation.

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:00.050
Yes, is that more than the

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:02.800
seven percent solution, Holmes?

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.530
Yes of course, Watson.

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:07.110
If we are to keep

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:10.060
books alive

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:13.570
preservation is the one 
hundred percent solution.

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:19.200
Hmm. Preservation. Hmm.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.359
Come along Watson.

00:13:20.359 --> 00:13:22.520
We've got to go.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:25.290
It's time.

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:29.690
Pre -ser -va -tion. Ha!
