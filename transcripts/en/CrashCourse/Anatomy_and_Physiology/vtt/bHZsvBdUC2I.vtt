00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.039
Let me introduce you to one of the bravest
pioneers in the history of life on planet Earth.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.500
An organism that blazed the trail for every
single vertebrate that lives on land today

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.860
-- and many that don’t.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.980
It’s one of your most important ancestors.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.200
Meet…well, it doesn’t have a name.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.420
And we don’t know exactly what it looked
like, either.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.350
But we do know that about 380 million years
ago, this fishy-looking thing with big, fleshy

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.570
fins achieved one of the animal kingdom’s
greatest milestones: breathing air.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.780
Sounds simple enough, but believe me it wasn’t.

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.440
Because, for billions of years before this
fishy ancestor came around, basically all

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.089
of life evolved in water.

00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:39.100
From the very beginning, the earliest, simplest
forms of life -- like bacteria -- extracted

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.269
oxygen they needed right from the water, through
their membranes.

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:45.629
And they did it through simple diffusion -- when
a material automatically flows from where

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.289
it is concentrated, to where it is less concentrated,
so it balances out.

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.209
Diffusion works really well, and it requires zero
effort, but it wasn’t gonna cut it in the big leagues.

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:59.120
Anything larger than a small worm is simply too
big and needs too much oxygen for diffusion to work.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.940
So in order to get bigger, early life forms
needed a circulatory system that could move

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.920
bulk amounts of oxygen around faster inside
their bodies, and a respiratory system to

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.980
bring more oxygen in contact with their wet
membranes.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:16.000
So their respiratory surfaces moved from their
outer surfaces to the insides of their bodies.

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.500
First, there were gills. But gills, of course,
still only work inside of water.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.530
And a little over 380 million years ago, this
was starting to lose some of its charm.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.329
Earth was getting warmer, the seas were getting
shallower, and much of the planet’s surface

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:30.209
water had lower concentrations of oxygen than
it used to.

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:36.719
Finally, a humble little lobe-finned fish got fed up, swam
up to the water’s surface, and started breathing air.

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:41.059
It could do this because it had evolved a
fancy new interface to move gases between

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.820
the air and its cell membranes.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.620
I’m talkin’ about lungs. Wet lungs.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.440
With an efficient new way to take in nearly
limitless amounts of oxygen from air, animals

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.230
were eventually able to get bigger and more
diverse over the ages, and now all of us lung-having

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.580
vertebrates share that common ancestor.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.079
For lots of animals, including humans, those
lungs come with a bunch of other equipment,

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.299
like protective ribs, a stiff trachea, and
in mammals a strong diaphragm. And together,

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.030
they form your respiratory system.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.180
Which happens to be best friends and business
partners with your circulatory system.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.470
It’s only by working together and using
both the bulk flow and simple diffusion of

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.010
oxygen that they can make possible the process
of cellular respiration.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.970
In other words: life itself.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.560
So, a lot of improvements have been made to
it over the eons, but the respiratory system

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.500
that you are using right now is your inheritance
from that ancient, ambitious fish -- leader

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.600
of one of the most important anatomical revolutions
of the past half-billion years.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.200
Pretend for a minute that you can’t breathe.
Like, you just don’t have lungs anymore.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.920
You are some bizarre evolutionary oddity -- a
huge, human-shaped organism that doesn’t

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.400
have a respiratory system.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.810
Instead, you get all of your oxygen the way
that your oldest, smallest evolutionary ancestors

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.240
did -- by simple diffusion.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.980
Or at least, you try to get your oxygen that
way.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.620
How would it work?
Well, poorly.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.080
And that’s partly because one of the keys to
efficient diffusion of any material is distance.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.760
If you want a molecule to diffuse across a
space quickly, you want it to be as close

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.930
to its destination as possible, with the fewest
obstacles in the way.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.240
But, for a single molecule of oxygen to diffuse
from the air through, say, your scalp and

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.560
then go to a neuron deep inside your brain,
it would have to move through your skin, and

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.940
then your skull, and then your connective
tissue and all sorts of things.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.210
It would eventually get there, like maybe
a month later, but at that point, the cell

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.840
that needed the oxygen in the first place
would have, you know, suffocated to death.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.940
Basically, obtaining oxygen through diffusion
alone is like wanting to go to a party at

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.380
your friend’s place across town, and then
walking 20 miles to get there. You could do it,

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.260
but it would take forever, and by the time you arrived,
you’d be all haggard and the party would be over.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.560
So, diffusion alone isn’t enough to get the job done.
We do use it, but only when a whole bunch of the

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.200
materials we need are right up against
the tissues that can absorb them.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.720
So you know what else we need? Bulk flow.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.120
Bulk flow is like public transportation -- it
moves large numbers of molecules, quickly.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.260
Rather than walk the whole way across town,
you can hop on a bus with a bunch of other

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.630
people, and get there in twenty minutes.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.320
Every time you take a deep breath, you’re
bringing a hundred quintillion oxygen molecules

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.960
into your lungs all at once -- they’re on
a bulk-flow bus ride.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.700
And once those oxygen molecules filter down
into the cells in your lungs, they’re suddenly

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.560
very close to the blood they’re trying to
reach. All they have to do is diffuse across

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.310
four layers of cell membranes to get from
the lung cell into the blood.

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.410
It’s like just hopping off the bus, and then
walking half a block to your friend’s apartment.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.400
That’s why your respiratory system is the
way it is: It’s set up to take full advantage

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.920
of both bulk flow and simple diffusion.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.660
The bulk flow part of things is handled by some of
your system’s biggest and most obvious moving parts.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.120
Starting with your lungs, which basically
operate like a pump, or a bellows.

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.720
They don’t have any contractible muscle
tissue, because they need to be able to expand,

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.060
so they require outside help in order to move.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.720
Enter the diaphragm -- a big, thin set of muscles
that separates your thorax from your abdomen.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.139
When your lungs empty, your diaphragm relaxes and
looks kinda like an arc pushing up to squish your lungs.

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:05.070
You also have the weight of your rib cage,
pushing on your lungs from the top and sides,

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.880
and together these forces decrease the volume
of your lungs.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.380
When you breathe in, your diaphragm contracts,
pulling itself flat, and your external intercostal

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:18.140
muscles between your ribs contract. They lift the
ribs up and out, causing the chest cavity to expand.

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.220
This makes the pressure inside the lungs lower
than the air outside your body, and -- since

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.040
fluids like gases move from areas of high pressure
to low pressure -- the lungs fill up with outside air.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.760
Then the diaphragm relaxes again, and the
weight of the ribs settles in, and the pressure

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.460
inside the lungs becomes higher than the outside
air, and the air rushes out.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.740
And that, my friends, is breathing 101.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.300
Now, your respiratory system contains a lot
of parts besides your lungs -- some prominently

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.690
displayed on your face, others hidden deep
within your chest. And functionally, all of

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.810
these organs fall into one of two physiological
zones.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.760
The upper parts that funnel the air in, make
up what’s known as the conducting zone,

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.580
and it starts with this thing.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.050
Your nose is supported by bone and cartilage,
and the bristly hairs and mucus inside it

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.210
that help filter out dust and other particles.

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.840
But it, along with your sinuses, performs
another important function: It warms and moistens

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.460
incoming air, so it doesn’t dry out those
sensitive lung cells that must remain wet.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.900
Remember, moisture is key. We evolved from
organisms that lived in water. So, just like

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.900
with our aquatic bacterial ancestors, we need
water for oxygen to dissolve into, before

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.240
it can diffuse across the phospholipid bilayer
membrane of our cells.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.990
Now, if you’ve ever choked on a poorly timed
sip of water, you’ve noticed that you breathe

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.340
through the same tube that you also move foods
and liquids through.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.400
This is yet another leftover from those first
fish lungs, which evolved as a branch off

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.240
the esophagus. Looking back, it was not
ideal. But we are stuck with it.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.389
So, the stuff that you swallow soon encounters
the epiglottis -- a little trap door of tissue

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:46.029
-- which covers the larynx, and directs bites
of sandwich and sips of cola toward your esophagus

00:06:46.029 --> 00:06:47.600
and keeps them out of your lungs.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.300
And you’ll notice that the esophagus, which
heads to your stomach, is nice and flexible,

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.560
while your trachea, or windpipe, is rigid
and has prominent rings.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.640
That’s because your trachea is basically built
like a vacuum hose -- since the lungs create

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:04.220
negative pressure with every breath, the trachea needs
those rings to keep it open. If it were soft and floppy,

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.700
it would collapse every time the pressure dropped,
and you wouldn’t be able to breathe.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:12.020
From there, the trachea splits in two, forming
the right and left main bronchi. You can imagine

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.610
these inner lung parts as sort of an upside-down
tree.

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:18.770
Now we are in the lung tissue, and have entered
what we call the respiratory zone. This is

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:23.800
where the actual gas exchange occurs, and everything
you find here has a form to suit that function.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.320
So the smaller branches of the upside-down
tree are bronchioles, which taper down into

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:32.419
progressively narrower tubes, until they empty
into the alveolar ducts and then dead end

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:36.340
into tiny alveolar sacs, where the bulk of
the gas exchange finally occurs.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:41.169
Because that’s because each sac contains
a cluster of alveoli, these tiny cavities

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:45.620
lined with super thin, wet membranes made
of simple squamous epithelium tissue.

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:50.080
It’s here that oxygen molecules dissolve
in the wet mucous, diffuse across the epithelial

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:55.140
cells, and then cross the single layer of endothelial
cells lining the capillaries to enter the bloodstream.

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:58.699
And of course it’s also where carbon dioxide
diffuses out of the blood, and then follows

00:07:58.699 --> 00:08:01.630
the same route back up to the nose and mouth,
where it’s exhaled.

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:06.300
So it’s your alveoli where diffusion meets bulk
flow. Because while you’re picking up oxygen

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:12.480
and dispensing with CO2 one molecule at a time, you're
doing it in enormous quantities at any given second.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:17.840
Both of your lungs contain about 700 million
alveoli, which together provide an amazing

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.660
75 square meters of moist membrane surface
area.

00:08:21.669 --> 00:08:26.429
So, the principles that make respiration possible
are relatively simple -- diffusion and bulk flow.

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:28.889
And so are the mechanisms in your body that
use them.

00:08:28.889 --> 00:08:32.349
It just took us about 400 million years to
figure out how to make it all work.

00:08:32.349 --> 00:08:36.669
But today you learned how it does work -- including
the mechanics of both simple diffusion and

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:41.050
bulk flow, and the physiology of breathing,
and the anatomy of the conducting zone, and

00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:43.240
the respiratory zone, of your respiratory
system.
