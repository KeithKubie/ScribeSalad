00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.640
Problem 51.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:07.390
Actually, let me scroll all
the way up, problem 51.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.620
They drew a little triangle
here, which I assume I need,

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.660
so I'll draw it as well.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.970
That side is flat and that side
goes down like that, and

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.640
then they draw some angles.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.390
This is being angle x, this is
angle y, this is angle z.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.990
And they say, what is
the value of z in

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.280
the triangle above?

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.820
Fair enough.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:42.410
Statement number one is x
plus y is equal to 139.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.325
Well, as soon as you see a
triangle and you have to

00:00:44.325 --> 00:00:45.320
figure out one side, you should
always remember that

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.530
the sum of the angles of a
triangle add up to 180.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.590
So we know that x plus y
plus z is equal to 180.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.690
Statement one just told us that
x plus y is equal to 139.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.180
So we know from statement
one that this is 139.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.330
So that would just make
this equation 139 plus

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.700
z is equal to 180.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.050
Which is very easy to solve.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.190
Subtract 39 from both sides
which you get z is equal to 41

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.990
or something like that.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.800
It doesn'nt matter, you don't
have to get the answer.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.560
You just have to know that
you can get the answer.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.270
So statement one, alone,
is enough.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.990
Now what do they give us in
statement number two?

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.840
Statement two, y plus
z is equal to 108.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.790
This statement alone
is useless.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.290
We don't know what y is.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.210
So we can't figure it out.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.610
I mean, one thing is true,
if you had both of these

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.460
statements, then you can figure
out all of the angles

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.030
of the triangle.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.930
Because you know that z is 41
then you could figure out y,

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.370
then once you know y you
could figure out x.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.340
But they're not asking
us that.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.720
We need to figure out
what angle z is.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.520
And this statement alone would
not tell us what angle z is

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.860
because we don't know
what angle y is.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.900
But statement one alone works.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.890
So the answer is A.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.280
Next problem.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.470
Turn the page.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.949
52.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:18.620
If x y and z are non-0-- they
could have written x times y

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.220
times z does not equal 0 because
that's the same thing.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.690
Because if any of them were 0,
it would have been equal 0.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.240
So I could have written
xyz does not equal 0.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.880
Because if you multiply three
non-0 numbers it's not going

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.410
to equal zero.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.110
But anyway, they're asking
is xz equal to 12?

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.330
xz equal to 12 is
the question.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.580
Statement one tells us-- and
I'll do it in a different

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.280
color-- e is the monotony.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.600
Statement one tells us
that x squared times

00:02:51.600 --> 00:03:00.310
yz is equal to 12xy.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.560
So let's see what we can do.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.380
What if we were to divide both
sides of this equation by xy?

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.020
Well, let's divide both sides
by x first. So if you divide

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.745
both sides by x, and we can do
that because we know that x

00:03:11.745 --> 00:03:12.762
does not equal 0.

00:03:12.762 --> 00:03:14.400
soon.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.710
Divide both sides by
x, you get xyz is

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.430
equal to 12y, right?

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.270
Divided by x on both sides.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.870
Now let's divide both
sides by y.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.030
You get xz is equal to 12.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.960
And we're done.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.860
Statement alone is enough.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.900
And remember, the only reason
why we we're able to divide

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.510
both sides by y is because we
knew it didn't equal 0.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.580
Now what does statement
two tell us?

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:45.830
Statement two tells us that
z/4 is equal to 3/x.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.900
And here we can cross multiply,
x times z is equal

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.390
to 3 times 4.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.230
And if that didn't make sense
to you, you could do it one

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.830
step at a time.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.710
Multiply both sides by 4, you
get z is equal to 12/x, just

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.510
multiplied both sides by 4.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.260
Then multiply both sides by x
and you get xz is equal to 12.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.570
So each statement,
independently, is enough to

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:09.530
solve the equation.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.050
So that's D.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.070
I always have to keep looking
back and looking at which

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.470
letter I have to say.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:16.800
I should memorize that.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.130
You should at least, you
have to take the GMAT.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:25.890
Alright, 53.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.280
A certain company currently
has how many employees?

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.070
So we want to know the
number of emps.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.560
How many employees.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.120
OK.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.790
So statement number one: if 3
additional employees are hired

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.200
by the company and all of the
present employees remain,

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.270
there will be at least 20
employees in the company.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.490
So let's say e is the number
of employees today.

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.010
So e plus 3.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.440
So the current number of
employees and three additional

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.490
are hired and all
of them remain.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.490
There will be at least 20
employees in the company.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.020
So it at least tells
us greater than

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.760
or equal to 20 employees.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.210
That's what statement one is.

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.625
And that by itself doesn't tell
me how many employees are

00:05:12.625 --> 00:05:13.450
at the company.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.150
It tells us that there at least
17 employees at the

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.220
company but it doesn't tell
us anything else.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.880
I mean you can subtract 3 from
both sides and you say e is

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.420
greater than or equal to 17.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:24.680
But e could be 100.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.760
I don't know.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.950
OK.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:31.570
Statement two: if no additional
employees are hired

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:36.240
by the company and 3 at the
present employees resign-- so

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.570
e minus 3-- there will
be fewer than 15

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.730
employees at the company.

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:48.150
So fewer than 15 employees.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.950
So not 15 or lower.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:56.460
They say fewer than 15,
so less than 15.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.300
Right here they said at least
20, so that's greater than 20,

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.780
greater than or equal to.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.740
Here they said fewer than, they
didn't say 15 or fewer,

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.970
they said fewer than 15.

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.050
So if you simplify this you
get-- add 3 to both sides--

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:13.060
you say e is less than 18.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.110
So, let me ask you a question.

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.220
First of all this by itself
isn't helpful because this

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.210
just tells us we could only 5
employees at the company or we

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.810
could have 10.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.430
This doesn't tell
us by itself.

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.770
But if we use both of these in
conjunction, you if we know

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:31.320
that e is less than-- so
if we say 17 is less

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.780
than or equal to e.

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.870
I just wrote this in
a different order.

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.720
Alright, 17 is less than or
equal to e, which is less 18--

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.320
I'm using both statements--
what is e?

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.905
It has to be greater than
or equal the 17,

00:06:43.905 --> 00:06:45.186
so it could be 17.

00:06:45.186 --> 00:06:46.470
Can it be 18?

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:48.700
Well, no, because it has
to be less than 18.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.170
So e has to be 17.

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.090
So both statements together
are needed

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:55.850
to solve this problem.

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:59.300
And that is C.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.860
Both statements, together,
are sufficient.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.110
Next problem.

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:10.205
54.

00:07:10.205 --> 00:07:14.470
Let me erase this little
5 I drew here.

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:18.130
54.

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:26.290
Alright, what is the value of
n in the equation minus 25

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:33.160
plus 19 plus n is equal to s?

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.800
Well, just to simplify it, we
could add up minus 25 plus 19,

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:42.285
you get minus 6?

00:07:42.285 --> 00:07:46.940
So you get n minus 6 is
equal to s, right?

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:47.890
That's right.

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:48.770
Actually, you don't
have to do this.

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:51.220
Remember the whole point of this
is to figure out whether

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:51.940
you can solve the problem.

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:53.860
You don't always have to solve
it but I'm solving them here

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:57.270
just to prove it to you.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.510
To give you the intuition of
when you can solve it.

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:00.390
So if you add 6 to both sides.

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:01.750
So anyway, this was just
a simplification.

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:02.530
Let's read the statements.

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:03.480
I haven't read them yet.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.890
Maybe I didn't have
to do any of that.

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:08.160
Alright, what problem
was I-- 54.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.360
OK. s is equal to 2.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.950
Well, clearly, if we know that
s is equal to 2, we can solve

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:14.510
for n. n would be equal to 8.

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:16.820
This statement alone
is sufficient.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:24.530
Now statement number two tells
us n/s is equal to 4, and once

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:27.770
again, as long as we have some
relation with n and s and we

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:31.360
can solve for s and then
substitute back in, we can

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.480
solve for n.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.070
And to prove it, let me do it.

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:41.549
We have n is equal to 4s, and if
we know that n is equal to

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:42.429
4-- what are we doing?

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:45.430
We're trying to solve for n.

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:49.230
We could write s is equal
to n divided by 4.

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:51.830
And then you can substitute
back into that equation.

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:55.440
So then you would get
n is equal to s,

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.100
which is n/4 plus 6.

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:00.600
And then you could
just solve for n.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.780
And if you want to do it, let's
see, multiply both sides

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:08.740
by 4, you get 4n is equal
to n plus 24.

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:11.690
That's an equal sign
not a not-equal.

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:13.660
I just multiplied
both sides by 4.

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:16.520
4n is equal to n plus 24.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:21.150
Subtract n from both sides, you
get 3n is equal to 24 and

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:23.000
then you get n is equal
to 8 again.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.650
So each statement alone
is sufficient.
