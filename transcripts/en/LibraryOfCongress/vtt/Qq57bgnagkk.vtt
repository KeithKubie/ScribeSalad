&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Good
morning, everybody.

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.080
I'm going to try to
start right on time.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.530
I'm John Haskell from
the Library of Congress.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.700
We welcome you to the 18th
annual National Book Festival.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.260
It is because of
contributors like Wells Fargo,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.110
David Rubenstein,
and many others

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.510
that this is now officially the
best free event in Washington.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.410
[ Applause ]

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.870
We're -- I'm going to turn
it over to Carlos Lozada

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.280
and the program in a second.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.110
I do want to remind you
to turn off electronic --

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.170
you know, silence your
electronic gadgets.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.530
We're on TV so, you know,
it won't be appropriate.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.670
I'm going to say one
thing about Carlos

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.070
and then turn it over to him.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.120
As probably most of you know,

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.080
at an event like this Carlos
is the nonfiction book editor

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.380
at the Washington Post.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.390
He was also at one time
the economics editor there

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.620
and national security editor
and the Outlook section editor.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.440
He was, just this year, a
finalist for the Pulitzer Prize

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.160
for Criticism and, in
2015, was the winner

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.990
of the National Book
Critics Circle citation

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.940
for excellence in reviewing.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.740
Carlos, welcome.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.660
[ Applause ]

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.070
&gt;&gt; Carlos Lozada: Good
morning and welcome

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.470
to the National Book Festival.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.000
It's my favorite event
in Washington bar none.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.790
So we're here to talk about
spies and intelligence

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.820
and maybe hacking, who knows?

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.060
But it is quite an honor to
introduce this morning's panel.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.710
Our moderator is Kai Bird,
the author of "The Good Spy:

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.510
The Life and Death
of Robert Ames."

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.860
He's also the co-author
of the Pulitzer-winning

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.040
"American Prometheus" on the
life of Robert Oppenheimer,

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.880
which I must confesses is one

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.610
of the greatest biographies
I've ever read.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.190
No surprise, Kai is also
director of the Leon Levy Center

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.190
for Biography at the City
University of New York.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.460
Our panelists are
Washington Post columnist

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.380
and novelist David
Ignatius, author of 10 novels,

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.040
most recently "Quantum Spy,"
spy novelist Joseph Kanon,

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.160
author most recently of
"Defectors," and Adam Sisman,

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.810
whose latest book is a
biography and he has explained

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.590
to me the proper
way to pronounce it.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.550
It is not le Carre it's
le Carre [pronouncing].

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.760
We can have a debate
about this later.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.070
In addition to being
part of the panel,

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.660
they'll be signing
books at 1:00.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.510
With that, I'm thrilled to
handed over to Kai Bird.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:48.280
[ Applause ]

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.810
&gt;&gt; Kai Bird: Good morning.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.880
So I assume we're all here

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.110
because we love a
good spy story.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.850
But we don't really
often admire spies

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.320
but we love a good spy story.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.060
So that's what we're
sort of here to discuss.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.880
And we have on stage here,
excluding myself, really three

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.600
of the world's foremost experts
on the world of intelligence.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.850
And I'm really delighted
to be here.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.460
My name is Kai Bird and I
want to first make a plug

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.010
for my little biography
center at City University.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.180
It's called the Leon Levy
Center for Biography,

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.970
funded by Shelby White
for the last 11 years.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.080
And it's a very special thing.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.190
It promotes the art
and craft biography

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.380
in a very specific way.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.690
We hand out four
$72,000 fellowships --

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.060
four of them every year and the
deadline is in early January.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.800
So if there any budding
first-time biographers

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.790
in the audience, think
about this fellowship.

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:04.600
I want to begin by talking a
little bit about Robert Ames.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.000
When I was 13 years old,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.840
my next-door neighbor
was Robert Ames, a spy.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.790
I had no idea he was a spy.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.180
And then years later, he was
tragically killed in Beirut

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.710
in 1983 and I read a novel
by David Ignatius called

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.690
"Agents of Innocence."

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:32.620
And David is not only the
Washington Post's reporter

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.750
on the intelligence beat but
he -- this was his first novel,

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.920
"Agents of Innocence," and
he's now written, I think 10.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.000
And that book got me
interested in trying to figure

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.170
out who my next-door
neighbor was.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:52.350
And David encouraged
me to do this book

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:57.080
and gave me many sources.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.230
And the only reason "The
Good Spy" happened is

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:02.980
because of David.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:08.250
I first met Joseph
Kanon in Los Alamos

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:14.450
and his first spy novel was
called "Los Alamos" and he had

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:19.160
in it a lovely, just moving
portrait of Robert Oppenheimer,

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.730
whom I later wrote
a biography on.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.290
And I had to tell Joe that
his little portrait of Robert

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.780
"Oppie," as he was called, was
the best I'd seen and better

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.290
than my 800 pages, which
tells you, you know,

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.710
the power of the novel.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.310
Finally we have, all the way
from London, Adam Sisman,

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.480
who is a biographer's
biographer.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.590
Literally, he wrote a
biography of the biographer --

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.420
i.e. "Boswell's Presumptuous
Task."

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.170
And now, two years ago I
guess -- three years ago,

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:02.640
he came out with this massive
biography of John le Carre,

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.700
otherwise really known
as David Cornwell.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:12.240
And he rips off the mask
from this very enigmatic man

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.940
that you all know
as John le Carre.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.640
Anyway, we're going to
begin with le Carre.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:26.910
And as some of you may already
know, le Carre was himself a spy

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.630
for about 5 1/2 years.

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:33.500
And many of his novels
draw upon that life.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:40.410
But Adam, you explained,
while he cooperated with you,

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:44.010
he refused to talk about
his five years as a spy

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:47.350
and specifically what
he was doing in Germany.

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:51.180
You found out a great deal about
what he was doing with Germany,

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:55.270
but why the reticence even,
you know, so many years later?

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.880
&gt;&gt; Adam Sisman: Well,
there's his answer

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.550
and there's my answer.

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.400
I mean, a bit of background.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:11.290
He, when he left Oxford, where
he had in fact been reporting

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:13.510
on his fellow students,

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:18.620
including a fellow
American student who --

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:24.880
to MI5, but he'd not come
in from the cold as it were.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.470
He was a schoolmaster
at Eaton for a bit

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:29.950
but then he joined MI5.

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:33.300
And he worked for MI5 for
two years before going

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.520
over to the dark
side and joining MI6,

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.570
where he was posted to Germany.

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:47.130
He says that he made a
commitment back then not to talk

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:54.210
about his secret work and
he wants to keep to it.

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:58.120
He is -- I mean, le Carre
for a long time pretended

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.700
that he wasn't involved
in secret work.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.300
He used to say, I'm just
a simple civil servant,

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.600
that's all.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.990
And he has gradually come
out of the closet as it were.

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:12.820
But he's very much in control
of that part of his story

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.470
but I found out from other
sources what he was doing.

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:20.550
And essentially, in the British
Embassy in Bonn as it then was,

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:27.100
in what was then West Germany,
he was what's called undeclared.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:31.470
That means he was posing
as an ordinary diplomat,

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:34.820
a second secretary, but
he was in fact reporting

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.610
to and working for MI6.

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:38.410
And his job really
was to keep --

00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:41.830
it wasn't running agents across
the border into East Germany

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:45.100
or into the Soviet
block, but keeping an eye

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.130
on political developments
on both the extreme left

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:51.200
and the extreme right
in Germany.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:55.320
And one of his lesser-known
books in fact, "A Small Town

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.000
in Germany," which is,
I think, unrecognized --

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.350
I think it's much better
than people realize --

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:08.380
is very much a portrait of
what he was really doing.

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:14.480
&gt;&gt; Kai Bird: Joseph Kanon,
turning to you, Joe you seem,

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.770
along with John le Carre,
to have had an obsession

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:20.500
with Kim Philby in your work.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:27.630
In your latest book, one of
your characters, Frank Weeks,

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.710
is clearly modeled after Philby.

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:33.410
Explain your obsession.

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:36.000
&gt;&gt; Joseph Kanon:
I think he's one

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.710
of the most interesting
characters

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:40.730
who (or real-life characters)
that anybody has run across.

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:43.590
And we had the great
good fortune that, A,

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:48.470
he wrote memoirs, which
are highly questionable

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:50.980
and self-serving.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:54.040
But we also had the great good
fortune he had four wives,

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:59.180
two of whom wrote memoirs
about his time in Moscow.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.250
So if you're an espionage
novelist

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:02.810
who is not himself a spy.

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:05.040
Every time I come
to DC, by the way,

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.780
on book tour there
will be question

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:12.210
from the audience about,
you know, the craft that's

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:15.830
in your books and it's always a
coded, loaded question saying,

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:19.320
how long have been
an espionage agent?

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.910
And I always say to them,

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:24.280
I have absolutely no idea
really what it's like.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.850
I just get it from other books.

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:27.190
I've never been approached.

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:28.960
I've never been recruited.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.260
And someone said, well,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.760
of course you would
say that [laughter].

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:37.830
So it's a total no-win
situation.

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:39.650
The serious answer to
the Philby question --

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:43.000
and yes, the character is very
much a kind of American Philby.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.430
And in large part, that's
because the number of details

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:50.210
about daily life there come
from what we know about Philby

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:53.090
because there's more
documentation about him.

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:57.210
But I think he's an exemplar of
why I think we're all interested

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:00.520
in spies, which is one of
the great questions in all

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.720
of literatures is who are we?

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.900
Who is that other person?

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.490
How knowable can
anyone be to us?

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:10.530
And when you encounter
a spy, it's someone

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:14.350
who is deliberately
pretending to be someone else.

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:17.310
This is a crime if you're
an undercover agent.

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:19.150
It doesn't have a narrative arc

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:20.670
like an armed robbery
or something.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:24.930
You're committing a crime 24/7,
all the time, your whole life.

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:26.420
You're lying to your colleagues.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:28.870
You're lying often
to your spouse.

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:31.390
You are living a lie.

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:35.290
What could be more interesting
to a novelist than to write

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:37.620
about someone who not
only are we trying

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:40.540
to peel back the layers
of that onion to know him

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:42.930
but he's resisting
at the same time.

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:45.840
I think it's a push-pull that
any fiction writer is drawn

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.040
to -- and readers I hope.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:51.640
&gt;&gt; Kai Bird: So that reminds
me, le Carre himself once wrote

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:59.580
that writers -- like a spy, his
real work is done alone and,

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:03.420
like a spy, writers
need secrecy.

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:08.410
Isn't there a sort of similarity
between what we all do

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:11.320
and the world of spies?

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.720
&gt;&gt; Adam Sisman: I think you
can convince yourself of that.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.640
When I started working
with David,

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:21.940
I started to imagine
myself as an agent and think

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:25.630
of assignations and be checking
out of the window whether

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:30.440
that person across the street
wasn't there five minutes ago

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.360
and that sort of thing.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.420
It is very seductive.

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.640
David himself -- David
Cornwell, that's the real name

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:42.640
for John le Carre
-- he plays a kind

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.100
of teasing game, as
readers will know.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:49.350
He wrote an autobiographical
novel called "A Perfect Spy,"

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:53.170
which depicts someone whose
early life is identical

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:54.890
to David's own early life

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:58.350
and whose father is a
portrait of his own father.

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:03.550
And when his first wife --
his divorced first wife --

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:06.900
read the manuscript of "A
Perfect Spy," she said,

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:09.740
I always wondered whether
David was a double agent.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:13.160
And I found myself
wondering that too.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:17.350
I don't think he was, actually,
but he plays that tease

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:20.940
with his readers and
carries on doing so.

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:25.650
&gt;&gt; Kai Bird: So David
Ignatius, your 10 spy novels

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:28.470
of course draw on
your own experience

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:30.950
as a foreign correspondent.

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:35.270
And I've always suspected

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:38.430
that the typical
foreign correspondent --

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:41.000
you were stationed in
Beirut at one point --

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:48.390
often has better sources
than the average CIA officer.

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:50.510
Wouldn't you agree
that that's true?

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:53.040
[laughter].

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:57.350
&gt;&gt; David Ignatius: I think
one technique that I used

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:00.530
as a journalist for
many years was to think

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:06.560
about who the CIA likely
would've recruited in a place

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:10.590
and then take a run at those
same people on the theory

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:13.560
that they'd begun to start
talking and they'd, you know,

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:17.060
once the cake is cut,
what's another slice?

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:22.790
I think that, in the time that
I got started as a journalist,

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:27.240
which overseas was 1980, the
United States had the wind

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:32.920
at its back and people all over
the world were eager to work

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.960
for the United States, work
secretly through the CIA,

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:39.830
work openly in other ways
because it was good for them.

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:42.860
They'd get business,
they'd make friends.

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.300
That was the way
the world was going.

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:49.470
I think we're now heading into
the wind rather than having it

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:51.670
at our back, and
maybe it is easier

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:55.210
for journalists to
approach people.

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:59.770
I'm just going to say briefly
in response to the earlier theme

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:04.690
of the way in which being
an intelligence officer is

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:09.340
like being a journalist --
and that's just obviously true

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:10.700
on one level, you know?

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:13.390
We're trying to pull
people's stories from them.

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:16.120
We're trying to establish
rapport.

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.430
We're trying to get
people to say things

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:20.470
that they might not
otherwise say.

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:22.540
But there's one huge
difference that you just have

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:24.930
to underline right now, which is

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:29.810
that journalists (if they're
doing their job) don't lie,

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:31.110
you know?

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:35.510
We're about telling the truth
and we work for our readers.

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:42.040
[ Applause ]

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.650
And you know, it's obvious
that we're in a moment

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:47.620
where that role,
that understanding

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:51.160
that that's what we do and
that we're not in the business

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.170
of lying is being challenged.

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:56.680
So I get a little nervous
when I hear people say, well,

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.350
it's just like being an
intelligence officer.

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:01.670
It's a little bit
like it but, ideally,

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:06.160
there's that fundamental split
that makes it very different.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.480
&gt;&gt; Joseph Kanon: There's
also a dark side to this,

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.920
the le Carre statement.

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:13.950
Yes, it's like being a spy
but it's also a question

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:16.840
of are you betraying
people as you're doing this,

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.390
as a spy inevitably does.

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:21.700
There was a famous journalist
who once said that, ultimately,

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.050
we're always selling
somebody out,

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:27.000
which means that you're drawing
material for them and using them

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.220
as copy or the basis for
whatever you're writing

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:34.210
without really going
to them for the source.

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:36.240
You know, one tries
to do that as little

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.600
as possible but it does happen.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.600
&gt;&gt; Adam Sisman: May I -- I mean,

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.250
I completely applaud
what David said.

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:47.070
I mean, that's absolutely
right and principled.

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:52.400
But novelists, as
opposed to journalists,

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:55.430
they are making things up.

00:16:55.430 --> 00:17:00.670
And often they are betraying
in the sense of using people

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:03.690
that they know, people
close to them as models

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:06.720
or using the experiences
that they've had with people,

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.910
maybe very intimate experiences,

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:11.020
to construct the
plots of their novels.

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:15.540
So I don't think the distinction
is completely clear-cut

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:16.840
in that sense.

00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:20.550
I think that David Cornwell's
parallel between spying

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:27.260
and writing novels
holds in that sense.

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.910
And there is an -- I mean,
Cornwell's novels are full

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:33.970
of betrayal and they're not
just spies betraying each other,

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:35.380
they're people betraying
each other

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:37.270
in their personal relationships.

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:44.720
And of course Philby did
this himself with his wives

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:50.030
and many other people but he
wasn't just betraying people

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:51.520
for intelligence reasons.

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:55.660
He was betraying people --
he was an extraordinary,

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:58.620
duplicitous character,
wasn't he?

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:02.530
&gt;&gt; Kai Bird: Well, but
you know, as a biographer,

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:09.010
I find I'm constantly
trying to seduce my sources

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:12.960
in the same way sometimes
that a spy does, I guess,

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.820
to cultivate a source.

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:16.870
You're trying to -- it's not --

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:22.700
you're not lying but you're
trying to get people to talk.

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:25.710
And you had to do
this with, I'm sure,

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:30.070
many of Cornwell's friends and.

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:31.370
&gt;&gt; Adam Sisman: I tried
to do this with David.

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:33.980
I tried to -- I'd often
think, oh, I know.

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:37.200
I know a way to get through,
you know, his defenses.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.170
And I'd arrive and
start talking to him

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:43.900
and I'd put the killer
question and then I'd realized

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:47.490
that he'd anticipated the
question and prepared an answer.

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:51.830
He's a very, very skillful
and very clever man,

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:54.760
and I often felt that
he was playing me rather

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:58.430
than me playing him [laughter].

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:00.980
&gt;&gt; Kai Bird: So,
in a larger sense,

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:05.960
I've always wondered whether
spies are a little overrated,

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.280
you know?

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:10.140
They -- and that is
actually one of the themes

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:13.800
in some sense of
le Carre's novels.

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:20.670
They are either failures or, if
they actually uncover, you know,

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:24.760
valuable, actionable
intelligence --

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:29.920
and David Ignatius, maybe you
can speak to this in your work

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:32.560
as a reporter covering
the intelligence world --

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:35.790
even when a good spy comes along

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:39.240
and offers valuable
intelligence,

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:43.630
no one in positions of
power wants to hear it.

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:46.510
It doesn't fit with the
conventional wisdom.

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:47.810
It's awkward.

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:52.260
It's -- so in history,
I see examples again

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.320
and again of this happening.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:59.130
So again, I'm wondering while
we all love a good spy story,

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:02.940
aren't they a little overrated?

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:04.240
&gt;&gt; David Ignatius: Well,

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.900
if you mean they
overrate the importance

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:11.970
of the intelligence that's
obtained in the flow of history,

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:14.890
I think that's probably right.

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:18.800
You know, I think of the story,
Kai, that you and I spent

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:20.650
so much time thinking about.

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:27.440
For me, it began on a morning
in February of 1983 when I want

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:31.780
to the US Embassy in Beirut
and about 12:30 I leave,

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:33.420
seeing the military attache,

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:39.120
and at 1:05 this enormous
car bomb detonates,

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.130
kills Robert Ames, one

00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:45.110
of the great intelligence
officers the United States has

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:46.410
produced, kills everybody

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:50.450
in the CIA station who's
in Beirut that day.

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:53.790
A kind of searing memory
for me is running back

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:56.560
and seeing the ruins
of the embassy,

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:59.360
the dead bodies everywhere.

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:04.840
And there was subsequently a
CIA officer who was determined

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:09.210
to find out how that bomb
got there that morning.

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:14.660
He just made it a passion at a
time when it was very dangerous

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:16.220
for Americans even
to be in Beirut.

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:18.710
But he went person to person.

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:25.380
Who recruited the Shia
Hezbollah officer in the south?

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:31.220
Who met the one in Beirut who
rented the car, you know, etc.?

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:34.230
And he gathered all
this intelligence,

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:35.940
thinking people must know.

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:37.240
All these people died.

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.620
All these American heroes
died -- got to find out.

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:42.340
And guess what?

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:44.920
He finished that reporting
and, so far as I know,

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:47.960
nobody ever did a
damn thing about it.

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:52.110
So, you know, there's an example
where, you know, the truth --

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:55.230
you shall seek the truth and
the truth doesn't set you free.

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:58.440
It doesn't -- it's not
really all that efficacious.

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:01.300
So I -- he's a fascinating
character.

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:02.760
I wish he was here
to join our panel

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.610
because he'd be pretty
angry about that question.

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:08.270
&gt;&gt; Kai Bird: And you
can't reveal his name?

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:10.910
&gt;&gt; David Ignatius: Well,
another time [laughter].

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:15.370
&gt;&gt; Kai Bird: No, that's
a story, you know,

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:16.780
that is still a mystery.

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:21.580
Who organized and executed
this car bomb attack

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:24.360
on the first US Embassy?

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:28.450
And it's a story that I try
to dig into in "The Good Spy,"

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:30.630
but it remains a mystery.

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:33.290
And as you say, no,

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:35.940
the US government really
didn't take any action

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:37.350
to try to figure it out.

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:38.750
&gt;&gt; Adam Sisman: But
taking your larger point,

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:41.240
I think there is room
for a lot of skepticism

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.850
about the value of intelligence.

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:50.190
I mean, if you think of many
of the most important episodes

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:53.900
in recent history, from Pearl
Harbor through the attack

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:59.340
on the Twin Towers
through to the failure --

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:02.420
the concocted story that Iraq
had weapons of mass destruction,

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:07.350
etc., etc., again and again
these are intelligence failures.

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:13.090
And they may be failures
of CIA or MI6.

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:17.760
I mean, I think we should
regard intelligence skeptically.

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.710
And often, the intelligence
is there

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:24.580
but it just hasn't been
recognized or properly analyzed.

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:29.780
That's really, I think,
as far as I understand it,

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:31.700
the root of the problem is --

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:34.980
I mean, the CIA obviously has
much greater -- and the NSA --

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:37.960
much greater resources than any
other intelligence agencies.

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:40.530
And in a sense, they gather
too much intelligence.

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:44.550
There's so much that you can't
see the wood for the trees.

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:47.590
There's just a vast
mass of material

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:50.180
and not clear what the shape is.

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:53.640
&gt;&gt; Kai Bird: Ah, Adam,
that reminds me of a story.

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:58.160
When I was doing my biography
of McGeorge and William Bundy,

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:02.360
the two Bundy Brothers, William
Bundy had worked in the CIA

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:06.340
for a long time in the 1950s,

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:09.550
working under a man
named William Langer,

00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:12.280
who was a Harvard professor
who had been recruited

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:18.530
to become head of the Office of
National Intelligence in 1952.

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:23.290
And when he was recruited,
he told Allen Dulles, well,

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:26.600
I can't possibly do the
job if you give me more --

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:31.480
more than 25 analysts
[laughter].

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:35.000
He wanted it small and lean

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.870
and he recruited Bill
Bundy as one of those 25.

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:43.280
But of course today, we have
an intelligence bureaucracy

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:47.040
that numbers -- David, how many?

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:48.340
&gt;&gt; David Ingatius: Oh, my gosh.

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:49.940
It's -- you'd need to
count all of the agencies.

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:53.030
It's many, many tens of
thousands, it's crazy.

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:57.280
We're not getting
our money's worth.

00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.800
&gt;&gt; Adam Sisman: I mean, a
good example of the failure

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:04.080
of British intelligence
came in 1940 where British

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.170
and French intelligence
failed to predict

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:08.470
where the Germans
were going to attack.

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:14.290
And they cut through the Allied
armies and caused the fall

00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:16.190
of France, caused the
British to withdraw,

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:19.250
ignominiously leaving all their
equipment behind at Dunkirk.

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:20.550
It was a disaster.

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:24.370
And afterwards, when the
intelligence was analyzed,

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:26.550
it was shown that
there were indications

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:28.120
of where the Germans
were going to attack.

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:29.420
They should have known.

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:30.830
They should -- if it had
been properly analyzed,

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:33.850
they would have -- they
should have known that.

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:36.860
But they just -- there weren't
the mechanisms in place.

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:38.570
&gt;&gt; Joseph Kanon: And
Stalin famously was told

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:39.960
that Hitler was going to invade.

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:41.260
&gt;&gt; Adam Sisman: Yes, yes.

00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:42.560
&gt;&gt; Joseph Kanon: And
decided to ignore it.

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:44.040
&gt;&gt; Adam Sisman: Again
and again -- by us.

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:46.090
&gt;&gt; Kai Bird: So maybe
our fascination

00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:49.770
with spy stories
comes from the fact

00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:57.240
that these stories are
metaphors for human failure.

00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:01.330
We're all human, we all
fail, we all make mistakes.

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:05.810
And spy stories are a
particularly vivid vehicle

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:08.050
for showing how this happens.

00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:09.350
&gt;&gt; Joseph Kanon:
I think it's fair

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:11.920
to say the better
spy stories do that

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:14.420
but most spy stories are
triumphant, you know?

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:17.620
They're about derring-do
and people who succeed

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:19.530
at whatever task
they're succeeding.

00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:21.860
You know, when people say that
we're all working in the shadow

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:24.180
of le Carre, A, I
think that's true,

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:28.100
I think he invented the modern
espionage novel as we know it.

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:32.960
But one of the great innovations
and what makes it a vehicle

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:36.950
for exploring character is that
essentially he took it away

00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:40.110
from those lampposts
and trench coats

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:41.950
and he brought it
into the office.

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:44.390
I think all of his
novels, one way or another,

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:45.700
are about office life.

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:48.930
This particularly true of
"A Small Town in Germany."

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:52.340
And if you notice, there's
very little violence.

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:55.270
There are very little
actual secrets.

00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:59.680
What the plot usually involves
is an intelligence agency

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:03.580
discovering each other
and who's betraying whom?

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:06.150
And in a sense, this is very
accurate because he was looking

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:08.140
to be at the apogee
of the Cold War which,

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:10.200
from a fiction writing
point of view,

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:14.150
was a wonderful source
material, a great subject.

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:15.600
Because what you had was a war

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:20.040
in which the ground troops
were the intelligence agencies.

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:24.060
You know, combat troops did
engage time to time but,

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:27.440
all during the Cold War, it
was the intelligence agencies

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:28.740
who were really on
the front line.

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:31.700
And so he had, you know,
a wonderful subject,

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:33.510
all of which we could relate to.

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:36.970
Very few of us are ever going
to live like James Bond but all

00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:38.270
of us have worked in an office

00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:41.810
where there's an impossible
person controlling the files

00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:44.390
and, you know, a boss
who turns up late

00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:47.380
and never answers you and,
you know, all of those things.

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:51.250
If you remember in "Spy
Who Came in from the Cold,"

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:55.510
what presumably precipitates
his disaffection is a quarrel

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:57.110
over the pension
payment, you know,

00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:59.720
it's all very bureaucratic.

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:02.330
&gt;&gt; Adam Sisman: In "Tinker
Tailor Soldier Spy,"

00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:07.010
there is a scene in which
Peter Guillam steals a file

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:10.630
from the Circus archive
and he's carefully --

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:13.770
has manufactured a dummy
file to put in its place.

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:16.540
And it's described to me as one

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:20.710
of the most exciting scenes ever
set in an archive [laughter].

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:27.600
And it is in fact extraordinary
tense and very dramatic and --

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:32.640
but it is really just a man
going into a room of files,

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:35.870
taking one file out and
putting another in its place.

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:37.750
That's what happens.

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:39.930
&gt;&gt; David Ignatius: You
know the thing, I think,

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:44.940
that makes John le Carre's
novels unforgettable

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:48.910
that marks all of us
in some sense marked

00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:52.270
and limited him later in
his career was the creation

00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:54.580
of the character, George Smiley.

00:28:54.580 --> 00:29:01.920
George Smiley embodies the
sense of the ambiguity,

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:10.490
the moral uncertainty, the kind
of, you know, routine nature

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:13.040
of intelligence work
at its best.

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:16.240
And just getting ready
for our discussion,

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:18.800
I went back in my
library and went back

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:23.300
to the very first John le Carre
novel, which was published

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:28.040
in 1962 called "Call
for the Dead"

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.760
and the first chapter is called

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:33.190
"A Brief History
of George Smiley."

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:37.910
And it opens with a description
of exactly the character

00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:40.890
that we then lived
with in so many novels.

00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:45.120
This is his very first book
and he already sees Smiley,

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:47.150
describes him as
breathtakingly ordinary.

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:51.530
And in the first paragraph of
that book, his wife, Lady Ann,

00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:54.780
runs off with a Cuban
race car driver.

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:57.500
You know, Lady Ann in the
books is always betraying him

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:01.700
with somebody, famously Bill
Haydon in "Tinker Tailor."

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:04.560
But that's, to me, the
genius of le Carre.

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.620
He lived a lot of real life.

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:09.450
He has all this real-life
espionage to draw on,

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:13.360
but he had the brilliance
to see this character.

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:17.370
He said that it was drawn from
a rector of Lincoln College

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:21.760
at Oxford and his
first boss at MI5.

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:25.190
So it's drawn from real people
but there's George Smiley.

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:26.490
There's his wife.

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:27.790
There's this sense of betrayal.

00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:30.120
Peter Guillam is
in that first book,

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:33.090
the Special Branch
Inspector Mendel,

00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:35.930
if you know these
books, they're all there.

00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:39.350
And then he just -- he has that
deck of cards from the start

00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:42.030
and then he just keeps playing
them through his career,

00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:44.580
right down to "Legacy of
Spies," the most recent book,

00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:48.290
which I loved, which has
Guillam and has Mendel,

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:51.960
all these same people who were
in the first book -- amazing.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.800
&gt;&gt; Adam Sisman: I'd
like to echo that.

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:57.560
I mean, I think that the
thing about George Smiley is

00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:01.580
that he is a complete
contrast with James Bond.

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:04.170
James Bond never questions
what he's doing is right.

00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:08.510
James Bond is an action man
and he has no real inner life.

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:11.340
Smiley is all the time troubled,

00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:15.250
anxious that the human
damage being caused

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:22.430
to all these little people,
ordinary individuals,

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:25.850
is worth the game -- he's
troubled all the time.

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:28.520
And he's even worried about
this archenemy, Karla.

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:33.380
At the conclusion of "Smiley's
People," Karla comes across

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:36.920
and Peter Guillam says
to him, George, you won.

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:40.580
He's not sure that he did
win and he's sort of hoping

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:45.620
that Karla will actually go back
because he feels sorry for him.

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:49.190
So Smiley is a man
with a conscience.

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:52.480
He's not -- he's
full of ambiguity.

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:56.410
He's not an out-and-out
Cold War warrior.

00:31:56.410 --> 00:31:58.000
&gt;&gt; Kai Bird: So Adam,
that brings back

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.980
to your biography which, as
I said earlier, you know,

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:07.160
you sort of rip the
mask off this guy.

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:11.810
He is an enigma and you
get very close to him.

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:15.980
You tell very intimate
stories about his love affairs,

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:21.870
mistresses, wives, his
betrayals of his wives,

00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:30.200
his troubled childhood,
his crazy con man father.

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:33.290
It's very revealing.

00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:39.030
And so I wonder, how did he --
and you had his cooperation.

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:41.270
How did he react to the book

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:45.070
and why did he publish
his own memoir,

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:47.870
"The Pigeon Tunnel," in 2016?

00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:49.850
I guess he must have
been working on that

00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:53.300
when you were working
on your biography, no?

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:55.450
&gt;&gt; Adam Sisman: Well, to answer
the first part of your question.

00:32:55.450 --> 00:32:56.750
&gt;&gt; Kai Bird: How did he react?

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:58.050
&gt;&gt; Adam Sisman: How
did he react --

00:32:58.050 --> 00:33:01.020
he reacted with a
22-page email [laughter]

00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:05.380
with 200-and-something
numbered points.

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:07.770
And as you can imagine,
when I received this,

00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:09.070
this is when I'd sent him --

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:11.250
I had an agreement that he
would be the first person

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:14.870
to read the manuscript before
my editor, before anybody else.

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:19.280
And so I sent it to him
and, a few days later,

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:23.070
this email came thudding
into my inbox.

00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:27.670
And my first reaction was
dismay but when I started to go

00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:31.160
through it, in fact, the points
were generally points of fact,

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:34.230
constructive, thoughtful.

00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:38.430
And we only really locked horns
over perhaps a dozen of them.

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:42.630
And he gave way on half a dozen
and I gave way on half a dozen,

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:46.620
so it wasn't really a
problem in that sense.

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:49.880
On the other hand, I won't
pretend that he's entirely happy

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:52.780
about my book and he seems to
have gotten more grumpy about it

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:56.120
as time has gone past.

00:33:56.120 --> 00:34:00.070
But you know, I feel if
he had been entirely happy

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:03.210
with it then perhaps it
wouldn't have been --

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:07.350
I wouldn't have done
my job properly.

00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:11.410
I had to not be too friendly --

00:34:11.410 --> 00:34:13.430
and he recognized
that too, I think.

00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:16.900
I mean, he's a very
thoughtful man about biography

00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:18.370
as well as everything else.

00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:22.620
I mean, his editor at Knopf,
long-term editor, Bob Gottlieb,

00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:25.480
who's dealt with a
great many fine authors

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.420
and very clever people
said to me

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:30.310
that David is the
cleverest man I ever met.

00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:31.610
&gt;&gt; Kai Bird: Whoa!

00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:32.910
&gt;&gt; Adam Sisman: Bar none.

00:34:32.910 --> 00:34:34.920
And I would put him
up there too.

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:38.140
&gt;&gt; Kai Bird: So did your
work inspire his memoir?

00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:42.320
&gt;&gt; Adam Sisman: No -- well, he'd
-- it's described as a memoir.

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:44.080
In fact, it's a collection
of pieces,

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:46.940
most of which have been
published before and, indeed,

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:49.830
the longest piece
appeared in the New Yorker

00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:53.590
in two parts back in, I
think it was 2000 and 2001.

00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:58.640
So it's really not quite
a memoir in that sense.

00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:04.100
There are only, I think, two
or three chapters that are new.

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:09.830
He told me that he wanted
to publish this quite early

00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:14.710
on in the process and told me
to hurry up because he said,

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:16.250
I'm not getting any younger.

00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:18.180
And that's fine.

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:20.400
I mean, you know, I
don't own his life.

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.830
It's his life and he can --

00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:25.040
I mean, if he wanted to
write a full autobiography,

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:27.390
that would be fine with me
and I'd be the first person

00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:29.640
to be queuing up to read it.

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:32.970
&gt;&gt; Kai Bird: So le Carre's
books, as Joe just explained,

00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:38.850
are all about the human
side, the ordinariness,

00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:45.690
the little human foibles
about human intelligence.

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:50.180
But David Ignatius, your
last spy novel is called

00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:54.870
"The Quantum Spy" and it's
about quantum computers

00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:58.660
and it's a look into
this high-tech world

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:02.890
that we're living with all
today in the age of social media

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:07.190
and such -- very timely.

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:09.550
And yet, even in this story,

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:12.610
the role of human
intelligence is central

00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:14.140
to understanding the plot.

00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:16.490
So can talk a little
bit about your book

00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:17.790
and your thinking about.

00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:20.070
&gt;&gt; David Ignatius: I
think one challenge

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:23.710
for spy novelists is
that, increasingly,

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:30.370
spying is about computers
and the Internet.

00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:35.900
I mean, covert action is, as
we've seen with the Russians,

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:40.260
the planting, amplifying
of information

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:45.730
through computer networks, the
classic penetration stories,

00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:50.290
mole stories that John
le Carre wrote about,

00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:58.560
these days involve electronic
means of contact, compromise.

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:01.450
And so the last five or
six years, I've been trying

00:37:01.450 --> 00:37:04.390
to figure out as a novelist
how you can be faithful.

00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:06.880
I like to write realistic
spy novels.

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:09.870
You can be faithful to
the reality that it's

00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:14.800
about the intersection
of computers, machines,

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:18.230
and human beings and also write
something that doesn't feel

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:21.360
like the extra credit problem
that nobody wants to answer.

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:22.870
And believe me, if you --

00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:27.340
writing about quantum computing
was right on the borderline,

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:29.070
it's really complicated.

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:32.690
But it is, you know, it's sort
of like the Manhattan Project.

00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:36.400
This is a machine that, if
they can build it, will be able

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:39.240
to decrypt anything that's
ever been encrypted --

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:43.800
that's the theory -- and
lay open every secret

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:45.300
that anybody has.

00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:47.380
So it's of enormous value.

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:49.060
It's sort of like the
Manhattan Project.

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:52.210
If you get it first, you
have a huge advantage

00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:55.210
for a long time -- for a while.

00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:57.160
And it's a race between
us and China.

00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:00.140
The Chinese know how
important it is and have said,

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:02.010
we're going to capture
this technology.

00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:04.640
So it's -- you want
to write about it.

00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:06.040
How do you make it real?

00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:07.820
And I'll just say, the challenge

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:11.230
in this book was inventing
interesting Chinese

00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:12.530
intelligence officers.

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:15.610
I think, for me, in all
of my books, you know,

00:38:15.610 --> 00:38:18.760
the things that I'm proud are
the Jordanian intelligence

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:23.030
officer in "Body of Lies"
who dominates that book,

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:29.550
the Pakistani head of ISI who
is interesting in "Bloodmoney."

00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:32.930
And in this book, there's a
character named Li Zian who is,

00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:36.090
I think, an interesting
subtle person.

00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:39.520
it's hard to make American
intelligence officers

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:41.740
as subtle as you want.

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:44.680
It just sort of goes
against our grain, you know?

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:49.070
So I have fun often with
the foreign characters

00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:50.760
in these books.

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:52.060
&gt;&gt; Joseph Kanon:
Another way to deal

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:53.750
with this issue is
just to go to the past.

00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:55.770
You know, someone said to me,

00:38:55.770 --> 00:38:57.570
why do you write
historical novels?

00:38:57.570 --> 00:39:00.980
And I said, well, I think
of it as the recent past

00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:03.190
and it's just pre-digital.

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:05.710
I find it so much more
interesting to meet somebody

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:09.570
on a park bench and, you know,
pass some newspaper than --

00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:10.990
whenever anybody says to me,

00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:14.300
upload onto your
server, I go [laughter].

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:17.280
Whatever that means, you know.

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:19.130
So I think it's very hard.

00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:21.450
&gt;&gt; Kai Bird: So Joe and
David, the two novelists

00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:27.340
on the panel here, why
have you never been tempted

00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:29.670
to do biography?

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:32.860
&gt;&gt; Joseph Kanon:
It takes too long

00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:35.160
and there's too much
work [laughter].

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:40.050
&gt;&gt; Kai Bird: Well, that's true.

00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:42.150
It takes longer to
write a biography

00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:43.920
than a novel most of the time.

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:46.070
&gt;&gt; Joseph Kanon: But I think
there are many similarities

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:47.370
between the forms.

00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:49.660
And look, you know, we've been
talking a lot about le Carre

00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:54.090
and the legacy, etc. and I think
that the most profound legacy,

00:39:54.090 --> 00:39:58.830
aside from just adding good
writing to the genre, has been,

00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:03.680
you know, to me one of the great
things that literature can do is

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:07.550
to operate as an agent for
moral inquiry and I think

00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:08.850
that le Carre did that.

00:40:08.850 --> 00:40:11.340
What he was exploring was
not simply the character

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:15.550
of these people but how they
were going to deal with morality

00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:18.920
of the actions that they
were asked to participate in.

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:20.220
You know, it's --

00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:23.040
the fundamental question should
always be, how do we live

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:24.780
and how should we live?

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:27.270
I don't mean that writing
should be prescriptive

00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:30.920
and no novel can actually answer
that, but I think novels need

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:34.340
to ask it or otherwise they
really are just James Bond,

00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:36.690
which are perfectly fun and
it's nothing against that

00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:40.160
and God knows we'd all like
his success and his money.

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:42.680
But I think that, you know,

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:44.980
what le Carre did was
open this whole field

00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:48.900
up to moral questions,
and I think ultimately

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:52.040
that makes for literature.

00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:54.370
&gt;&gt; Kai Bird: So, Adam,
coming back to le Carre --

00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:57.690
oops, I'm sorry, David?

00:40:57.690 --> 00:40:59.750
&gt;&gt; David Ignatius: No, no,
I just -- I was going to --

00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:02.830
my answer would be
just like Joe's.

00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:05.930
It's too hard to write
nonfiction, too many footnotes.

00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:11.010
And I have to -- I live in the
world of fact twice a week.

00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:13.430
I have to write -- I
get to write columns

00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:15.030
for the Washington
Post [laughter].

00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:19.350
I want to say you have read them

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:21.980
but then you don't have
to read them either.

00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:24.890
So, you know, I'm immersed
in the world the fact.

00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:30.600
And to be able to escape
it for this big canvas

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:32.540
where you don't have
to at the end say,

00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:34.190
this is precisely
what you should think.

00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:36.440
This is precisely
how it turned out.

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:41.230
You can let all the ambiguities
exist in the characters.

00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:43.730
I mean, I'll write
one nonfiction book

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:47.540
and that'll be my memoirs but,
until then, I don't think so.

00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:48.840
&gt;&gt; Kai Bird: Okay.

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:51.450
We look forward to the memoirs.

00:41:51.450 --> 00:42:00.830
So Adam, finally, many of
le Carre's novels are --

00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:04.410
the early ones are rather
critical of the Cold War --

00:42:04.410 --> 00:42:10.180
that's a sort of message
you get from them.

00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:14.380
And his later novels
become increasingly,

00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:19.510
I think some critics have
said bitter and anti-American.

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:22.330
Can you explain his politics?

00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:25.100
&gt;&gt; Adam Sisman: I'm actually
giving a talk on this subject

00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:28.340
on Wednesday at the
Woodrow Wilson Center.

00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:32.470
I mean, his -- most
people in general,

00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:34.040
and I think this is
a generalization,

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:37.970
become more conservative as they
get older, but David has gone

00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:40.720
in the opposite direction,
he's become more radical

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:43.880
and more angry and
I personally think

00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:45.220
to the detriment of his fiction.

00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:50.000
I think his best work was in
the period when he was writing

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.190
about George Smiley when he
deals with the ambiguities

00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:56.740
of the Cold War and the fact

00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:59.680
that neither side
was completely right

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:02.180
and neither side was
completely wrong.

00:43:03.970 --> 00:43:08.760
Now his novels appear to me to
be much more black-and-white.

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:10.190
They are goodies and baddies.

00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:13.270
In fact, they're more like
the "James Bond" books.

00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:17.330
And I'm afraid all too often
the baddies are American,

00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:20.710
although some pretty
nasty Brits too.

00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:23.740
And I think there's a
certain strain in David of --

00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:28.650
well, actually, I think it's a
slightly old-fashioned chippy

00:43:28.650 --> 00:43:34.570
attitude that some Englishmen
of an older generation feel

00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:37.990
about America, resentment
of America taking

00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:42.320
over from our role,
our predominant role,

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:47.780
which was not only
exemplified in the events

00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:49.320
of the Second World
War and the aftermath

00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:51.480
but also was very much
there in the minds

00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:53.110
of the intelligence
officers, I think,

00:43:53.110 --> 00:43:56.180
at the time that David
went into MI5 and MI6.

00:43:56.180 --> 00:44:02.660
I think that was very much in
the culture and also a feeling

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:06.750
of bemusement by the fact that
they'd been betrayed by Burgess,

00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:12.850
Maclean, Philby,
etc. So yes, I agree.

00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:15.970
His politics have become
more one-dimensional

00:44:15.970 --> 00:44:18.740
and I think less
interesting, myself.

00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:21.450
&gt;&gt; Kai Bird: So I think we have
time for five or six minutes

00:44:21.450 --> 00:44:25.900
of questions, if there are
any, from the audience.

00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:29.000
Aviva -- there's one
right behind you, I think.

00:44:37.610 --> 00:44:41.200
&gt;&gt; Aviva Kempner: So I'm making
a documentary on a spy named

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:44.990
"Moe Berg: American Spy,
OSS, baseball player."

00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:47.420
I've already filmed
David and, hopefully,

00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:49.000
I will be filming Kai.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.950
What I'm realizing is Hollywood,
which I'm not a part of,

00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:57.200
I think has contributed to the
glamorization and the violence

00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:58.820
of what a spy's life is like.

00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:03.490
And it's more the more detailed
work, the intelligence work,

00:45:03.490 --> 00:45:06.390
certainly someone like Moe
Berg did, especially in terms

00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:09.620
of getting Italian
scientists out.

00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:12.540
And they really did him
injustice in the feature film

00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:15.160
that Hollywood just made
with all these shootouts

00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:18.020
that had nothing to
do with his career.

00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:20.940
So I'm just asking
you, do you agree --

00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:22.890
two questions, that
Hollywood I think has,

00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:25.930
especially the "James Bond" --
I like the early "James Bond" --

00:45:25.930 --> 00:45:30.470
has contributed to taking away
really the hard work a spy does.

00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:34.610
And second of all, I think
we need the OSS back in terms

00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:38.080
of the cybersecurity -- I
wonder what David thinks

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:42.130
because this -- we don't
need military parades.

00:45:42.130 --> 00:45:43.430
We don't need to go to the Moon.

00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:44.780
We've got to figure this out.

00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:46.820
[applause].

00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:49.360
&gt;&gt; David Ignatius: Well,
we need the OSS back.

00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:52.370
We need, you know, the
sorts of presidents

00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:57.410
who chartered the OSS -- that
would be nice too [applause].

00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:03.620
So Aviva, you know, I think --

00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:07.840
I can't wait for your
documentary on Moe Berg.

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:10.160
Because we're talking about
John le Carre, you'd have to say

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:13.850
that Hollywood has been
faithful to the essence

00:46:13.850 --> 00:46:16.840
of what those books are about.

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:18.140
They didn't screw 'em up.

00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:23.580
They didn't put a gun in
Smiley's hand or even really

00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:26.660
in Peter Guillam's, although
his job was, you know,

00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:29.440
the scalphunter,
the tough guy stuff.

00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:32.400
The movie that was made of one
of my novels, "Body of Lies,"

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:35.960
was faithful to the
texture of it.

00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:38.840
They didn't -- so I
think Hollywood gets

00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:42.890
that the more realistic
accounts of espionage are things

00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:45.280
that people want to see.

00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:46.580
&gt;&gt; Joseph Kanon:
The movie they made

00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:49.220
out of my novel was just
terrible and, actually,

00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:51.890
if they would've added
some gunplay it might've

00:46:51.890 --> 00:46:54.190
helped [laughter].

00:46:57.390 --> 00:46:58.690
&gt;&gt; Audience Question:
Good morning and thank you

00:46:58.690 --> 00:47:00.440
for the discussion today.

00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:04.110
One of the motivating factors
of spy novels, as I've seen it,

00:47:04.110 --> 00:47:06.660
is the clash of civilizations.

00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:12.950
How do -- how will the
novel genre emerge over time

00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:15.720
with a change in
clash of civilizations

00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:19.900
from between the US and
the Soviet Union to the US

00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:24.220
and China, to other venues of
conflict and how is that going

00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:32.360
to change how spy novels are
both written and understood?

00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:35.770
&gt;&gt; Joseph Kanon: I think that's
a really interesting question.

00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:39.120
And at the moment, we
are in a state of hiatus.

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:42.490
I think that, obviously,
the interesting clash

00:47:42.490 --> 00:47:48.110
of the century we're now
in is going to be Chinese.

00:47:48.110 --> 00:47:50.940
There's a great question of how
much do fiction writers know

00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:52.240
about Chinese culture?

00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:55.420
How much do they know and
can access Muslim culture

00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:57.180
or Middle Eastern culture?

00:47:57.180 --> 00:48:00.750
It's more difficult because
it's, I think, a rarer knowledge

00:48:00.750 --> 00:48:05.020
on our part, whereas Russia is
definitely the devil we know

00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:07.960
and the devil we've been
writing about for decades.

00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:10.830
And to be -- I suppose
how frivolous,

00:48:10.830 --> 00:48:12.630
one of the things they've
done is to give all

00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:15.510
of fiction writers a
kind breathing space

00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:19.130
because they're insisting on
being center stage yet again.

00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:22.560
I mean, just when you thought
that Russia was going to have

00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:25.520
to withdraw from this
role, there they are.

00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:30.090
They just will not be shunted
aside, at least in espionage.

00:48:30.090 --> 00:48:34.150
This is, you know, the great
advantage they've always had.

00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:36.520
So I think, for a while,
we're going to continue

00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:41.950
to have post-Cold War Cold War
kind of fiction being written.

00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:44.800
But ultimately, people are going
to have to adjust and have --

00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:49.590
because what's really important
is what -- is going to be China.

00:48:49.590 --> 00:48:51.830
&gt;&gt; Kai Bird: Okay, we
have two minutes left.

00:48:51.830 --> 00:48:54.020
&gt;&gt; Arnold Zeitlin:
Quick question.

00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:56.840
My name is Arnold Zeitlin
and I've reported abroad

00:48:56.840 --> 00:49:00.650
for Associated Press and United
Press International and this is

00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:06.360
for Mr. Ignatius, whose columns
indicate you have access --

00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:09.730
considerable access to the
intelligence community.

00:49:09.730 --> 00:49:12.550
Now we have a situation
where the president

00:49:12.550 --> 00:49:17.720
of the United States is
very antagonistic toward the

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:22.950
intelligence community
and I'm wondering

00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:28.190
if you see any pushback from
the intelligence community,

00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:33.820
a situation that could
be quite dangerous.

00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:35.160
&gt;&gt; David Ignatius: You
know, there is this argument

00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:37.370
on the right that
the Deep State,

00:49:37.370 --> 00:49:41.520
the intelligence agencies
is doing just that,

00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:44.250
it's pushing back.

00:49:44.250 --> 00:49:45.640
I don't see that.

00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:48.010
You know, I have
limited visibility.

00:49:48.010 --> 00:49:50.710
I always need to say, most of
the stuff about how much I know

00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:55.950
about the intelligence agencies
is nonsense -- I wish I did.

00:49:55.950 --> 00:50:00.560
But from what little I know,
it's mostly what I think

00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:02.740
of as the Richard
Helms philosophy,

00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:05.880
let's get on with it,
let's do our jobs.

00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:09.420
And I think, both in terms
of recruiting sources,

00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:13.110
in terms of liaison
relationships, in terms of all

00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:16.080
of the humdrum activities
around the world,

00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:18.190
people just keep doing them.

00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:21.690
They have, at the top of the
pyramid, a White House that,

00:50:21.690 --> 00:50:23.800
as we all know, is
kind of unpredictable.

00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:26.920
But my sense is that the
pushback you're thinking about,

00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:29.480
that I've thought about,
every time I ask, I'm told,

00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:32.600
not really happening --
and not just by Americans,

00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:33.960
but by people overseas.

00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:35.260
&gt;&gt; Arnold Zeitlin: Thank you.

00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:36.560
&gt;&gt; Kai Bird: Okay, the
last question here.

00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:38.430
&gt;&gt; Audience Question:
There's a recent novel written

00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:42.430
by Daniel Silva called "The
Other Woman" in which he talks

00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:46.970
about Kim Philby quite
a bit in the novel.

00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:50.710
In that, he talks about the
tension between espionage

00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:54.310
and politics and
basically damns Britain

00:50:54.310 --> 00:50:58.260
because they allowed
politics to get involved

00:50:58.260 --> 00:50:59.560
in the Philby situation.

00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:03.800
Can you address the
tension between politics

00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:09.350
and espionage [laughter]?

00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:14.230
&gt;&gt; Joseph Kanon: Except to
say that it always exists,

00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:19.230
in Philby's case, look, I think
what obviously he's referring

00:51:19.230 --> 00:51:23.080
to is the fact that the
establishment circled the wagons

00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:24.400
and decided to protect him.

00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:29.780
There is the theory that they
were having conversations that,

00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:32.690
in code, said to him, for
God's sakes, defect and get

00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:34.750
out of here so that we
don't have to have a trial

00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:37.280
and expose everything
to the public,

00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:39.830
which would be embarrassing,
much in the same way

00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:41.430
that Anthony Blunt
was protected,

00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:44.390
etc. I don't know
that for a fact.

00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:46.270
I mean, I think it's one
of those wonderful tropes

00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:50.750
that everybody uses in writing
novels about that period.

00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:53.050
How can you separate
them though?

00:51:53.050 --> 00:51:57.670
I mean, the espionage is
a function of the politics

00:51:57.670 --> 00:52:01.650
and we are, you know,
it may be true

00:52:01.650 --> 00:52:03.880
that it's the world's
second oldest occupation,

00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:07.670
as everybody likes to say,
but the kind of espionage

00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:08.970
that we're talking about,

00:52:08.970 --> 00:52:12.440
which is a vast government
bureaucratic enterprise,

00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:14.080
is a relatively recent
phenomenon.

00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:16.440
I mean, in America we didn't
have the Central Intelligence

00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:18.000
Agency until '47.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.860
That's, you know,
within our lifetimes.

00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:21.860
That's really short.

00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:24.540
And what we're now facing is,

00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:28.180
how do you marshal these
vast bureaucracies?

00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:29.600
How do you control them?

00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:31.640
Are they going to
be self-operating?

00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:35.010
Are they going to be responsive
to government directives?

00:52:35.010 --> 00:52:36.310
Who knows?

00:52:36.310 --> 00:52:37.870
These are, you know, really
interesting questions.

00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:39.170
&gt;&gt; Adam Sisman: And
one other word.

00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:41.150
I mean, the Cold War was
about politics, wasn't it?

00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:44.800
I mean, it was a political
argument between West and East,

00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:47.230
between communism
and the free will.

00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:48.550
I mean that, in essence,

00:52:48.550 --> 00:52:51.240
was what it was supposed
to be about.

00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:53.120
So I don't see how you
can separate the two.

00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:55.330
&gt;&gt; Kai Bird: Okay, one final
anecdote I can't resist.

00:52:55.330 --> 00:53:05.190
In 1964, -- in the 1990s, I
interviewed a CIA analyst who,

00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:10.050
in 1964, wrote the World
Intelligence Report.

00:53:10.050 --> 00:53:14.580
And very controversially,
he predicted

00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:18.600
that the Soviet Union was
facing economic collapse

00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:22.930
and internal ethnic tensions
and he predicted that,

00:53:22.930 --> 00:53:26.960
sometime in the 1980s,
it would collapse.

00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:30.780
He was allowed to put
this into the report,

00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:36.860
but no one believed it, no one
acted upon it, and no one wanted

00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:44.670
to believe that the major
adversary was actually a weak

00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:46.210
paper tiger.

00:53:46.210 --> 00:53:50.130
And that, I think, says
something about the world

00:53:50.130 --> 00:53:53.000
of intelligence,
the ambiguity --

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:57.290
which le Carre wrote about
all throughout his novels.

00:53:57.290 --> 00:54:01.970
Anyway, thank you very
much for coming [applause].
