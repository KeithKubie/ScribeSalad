[music playing]

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:02.734
KARSTEN (VOICEOVER):
I've asked my friend

00:00:02.734 --> 00:00:04.066
Lugs to help me take
a look at the Ping

00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:07.000
Shin 101's last journey.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.166
KARSTEN: Let's just
go through this

00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:09.567
together because there
are a couple things

00:00:09.567 --> 00:00:11.133
I need some verification on.

00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:13.333
Ready?

00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:16.033
KARSTEN (VOICEOVER): As a former
New Zealand Navy engineer,

00:00:16.033 --> 00:00:19.700
Lugs knows what it
takes to sink a ship.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.600
So here's what I think it did.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.100
In July 2014, went
past Diego Garcia

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.400
and then was
intending to sail home

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.200
all the way back to Taiwan.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.000
And in this part right here,
in the middle of the Indian

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.233
Ocean-- furthest away from
Ache, pretty far from Colombo,

00:00:39.233 --> 00:00:41.633
relatively far
from Diego Garcia--

00:00:41.633 --> 00:00:47.734
on the 7th of July, 2014,
it sank here, right?

00:00:47.734 --> 00:00:48.533
Yeah.

00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:51.867
[music playing]

00:00:51.867 --> 00:00:55.033
This is the Australian
Maritime Safety Agency,

00:00:55.033 --> 00:00:59.500
and they had a report out that
the Ping Shin 101 suffered

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.000
mechanical failure and that
the crew was abandoning

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.834
the vessel into life rafts.

00:01:03.834 --> 00:01:06.767
It depended what the
mechanical failure was.

00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:09.066
KARSTEN (VOICEOVER): Ships
that lose power in heavy seas

00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:12.734
can capsize as they drift
broadside to the current.

00:01:12.734 --> 00:01:16.734
Yet there's no talk
of that in the report.

00:01:16.734 --> 00:01:19.433
KARSTEN: You've had cases
where ships have broken

00:01:19.433 --> 00:01:20.800
down with mechanical
failure, and they

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.066
just get towed into port.

00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:24.433
Yup.

00:01:24.433 --> 00:01:26.400
KARSTEN (VOICEOVER): But
there's a second report

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.166
from the rescue ship.

00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:30.867
KARSTEN: They said that
this ship experienced

00:01:30.867 --> 00:01:33.233
flooding in the engine room.

00:01:33.233 --> 00:01:34.433
Would one of these
things sink just

00:01:34.433 --> 00:01:36.066
because the engine room floods?

00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:38.000
Don't you think
that's a bit weird?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.033
It is.

00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:40.367
It is.

00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:42.000
Because they always
use the engine room

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.834
as a safe room for
pirate attacks,

00:01:43.834 --> 00:01:45.033
because you can
lock it and seal it.

00:01:45.033 --> 00:01:46.166
You can lock it down, yeah.

00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:47.400
So it would be
the same, right?

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.767
It should be watertight.

00:01:50.767 --> 00:01:52.200
And why would that rupture?

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.800
It would have to run
aground or someone's

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.100
done it on purpose.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.800
You mean someone
scuttling the ship.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.100
Yeah.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.567
KARSTEN (VOICEOVER):
I'm sure the rescuers

00:02:00.567 --> 00:02:03.233
only reported what
the crew told them,

00:02:03.233 --> 00:02:04.233
but why the inconsistency?

00:02:04.233 --> 00:02:07.934
[music playing]

00:02:07.934 --> 00:02:12.066
KARSTEN: The Taiwanese then
say in their official report

00:02:12.066 --> 00:02:16.633
that the Ping Shin 101 grounded
and started taking on water

00:02:16.633 --> 00:02:18.333
and sank.

00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:20.900
And I mean, this is
where it sank right here,

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.200
and in this immediate area,
the nearest landmass--

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.867
the nearest place where
there is even a reef

00:02:26.867 --> 00:02:28.600
for this thing to ground on--

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.700
was in Diego Garcia.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.533
And that's 470 nautical miles.

00:02:34.533 --> 00:02:35.633
KARSTEN (VOICEOVER):
Diego Garcia

00:02:35.633 --> 00:02:37.533
is a British
territory that's home

00:02:37.533 --> 00:02:39.400
to a major US military base.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.900
It seems unlikely that the
Ping Shin would come close

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.300
enough to shore to run aground.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.834
KARSTEN: And even if the
Ping Shin 101 grounded,

00:02:50.834 --> 00:02:52.166
is it feasible that
they could have

00:02:52.166 --> 00:02:56.533
even sailed 470 nautical
miles while taking on water?

00:02:56.533 --> 00:02:57.233
Yeah, there's no way.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.533
KARSTEN (VOICEOVER): The
loss of the 101 is important.

00:03:03.533 --> 00:03:08.033
It was the key physical
link to the killings.

00:03:08.033 --> 00:03:10.667
Normally, a homicide scene
would have forensics--

00:03:10.667 --> 00:03:14.300
fingerprints, DNA.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.567
In this case, we
only have video.

00:03:16.567 --> 00:03:19.667
And even the ship it was
recorded on has gone.
