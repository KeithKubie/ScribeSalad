00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.890
LISA NICHOLS: How
are you guys doing?

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:02.610
My name is Lisa.

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:03.522
Good afternoon.

00:00:03.522 --> 00:00:04.900
God, I love intimate.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.090
I never get a chance to
have intimate environments.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:07.924
So this is like fun.

00:00:07.924 --> 00:00:10.256
I know somebody would come
up and go, where is everyone?

00:00:10.256 --> 00:00:10.960
I'm like, ooh.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.432
Finally, I can see
every face in the room.

00:00:13.432 --> 00:00:14.390
How are you guys doing?

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.130
So first, I have to say
I'm from California.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.459
So it's cold.

00:00:19.459 --> 00:00:21.000
Because if I get
that out of the way,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.790
then I can be present
with you guys.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.520
But I'm grateful that it's
sunny even though the sun is

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.185
an illusion that it's warm.

00:00:27.185 --> 00:00:29.060
In California when the
sun is out, it's warm.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.099
And that's the only place,
obviously, that that exists.

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.640
So I'm excited to
be in front of you.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.720
I'm excited to be with you.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.680
This book, "Abundance
Now" is a culmination

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.470
of about 25 years of work.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.080
In 1994, which isn't
quite 25 years ago.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.710
But in 1994, I was on
government assistance.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.050
And I had to get on government
assistance to have my son.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.440
And I was on WIC, Women,
Infant, and Children,

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.690
which is free cheese,
free pasta, free milk.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:59.480
And I'm grateful.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.770
I was embarrassed,
but I was grateful.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.310
Because as a mom, you just want
to take care of your child.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.205
And when my son was
eight months old--

00:01:07.205 --> 00:01:09.580
I'm just kind of telling you
how did this book come about

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.820
without me knowing that
the book was coming about.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.150
When my son was eight months
old, I needed Pampers.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.120
A change of Pampers.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.290
And I went to the cupboard to
get Pampers and there was none.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.560
So I went to the ATM to
get $20 out to buy Pampers

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.450
and I had $11.42 to my name.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.720
Yeah, that's exactly what I did
when I saw insufficient funds.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.610
And I remember going
home wondering, what

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.870
am I going to do?

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.370
I wrapped my son in a towel.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.980
And for the next two days,
I just changed his towel.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.800
That's all I could do.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.567
And so on the second
day-- I never say it

00:01:49.567 --> 00:01:50.650
without getting emotional.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.275
And people go, you
still get emotional?

00:01:52.275 --> 00:01:54.160
Yeah, I was still the same mom.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.930
I'm just allowing myself
to recall that experience

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.120
so that I can share it so
you understand the why.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.449
It's never easy to
recall the experience,

00:02:01.449 --> 00:02:03.240
because I think there's
only two things you

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.200
want to do with your children.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.640
And that's keep them safe
and be able to feed them

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.507
and raise them.

00:02:06.507 --> 00:02:09.090
And I felt like I could only do
one, which was keep them safe.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.000
But feeding him and raising
him was challenging.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.900
And so on the second day of my
son being wrapped in a towel,

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.980
I put my hand on my
son, Jelani's stomach

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:18.800
and I said, Jelani.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.130
Don't worry.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.740
Mommy will never be
this broke again.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.080
Ever.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.374
And that was the journey to now.

00:02:27.374 --> 00:02:29.540
Like, I just want to give
you all the way back then.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.340
A lot of things
happened since then.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.930
But I've been interviewed--
in 2009 alone,

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.905
I was interviewed 155 times.

00:02:36.905 --> 00:02:40.360
This was when my first
single book came out.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.030
And I was interviewed 155 times.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.010
And probably 147 times they
asked, how did you do it?

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.990
How did you go from being broke
and on government assistance

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.630
to running a multimillion
dollar company?

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.410
And lately, I hear,
how did you go

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.760
from being on public
assistance to running

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.720
a publicly-held company?

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.650
My company went
public two years ago.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.230
I am the only company in the
self-development industry

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.290
to have a company
on Wall Street.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.420
And I am one of two African
American women founders

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.152
to own a publicly-held company.

00:03:13.152 --> 00:03:14.610
So I get that
question-- thank you.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.530
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.310
Thank you.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.810
Thank you.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.060
I get that question a lot.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.550
How did you go from public
assistance to being public?

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.240
And I always have to start
with on that day in 1994

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.500
when I put my hand on my son's
belly and said, don't worry,

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.550
Jelani.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.650
Mommy will never be
this broke again.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.160
Something shifted.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.300
I was willing to do what
I had never done before.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.020
I was willing to say what
I had never said before.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.020
But first, I had to learn
what I didn't even know.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.680
I knew that abundant
thinkers-- prosperous people,

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.140
successful people-- were doing
something that I wasn't doing.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.200
Because my life was evidence.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.830
Your life is the evidence
of what you're up to.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.920
Good, bad, or
indifferent, your life

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.551
is evidence of
what you're up to.

00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:02.550
And so I wanted to be up
to something different,

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.190
but I didn't know how to be
up to something different.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.790
I needed to learn something
different to be up to something

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:07.300
different.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.230
And so I start following
successful people.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.480
And I wanted to know, what
did they do in the morning?

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.530
What did they do at night?

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:13.660
What did they do
when they failed?

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.400
And I like those
behind-the-black curtain

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.390
questions.

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.930
Like, I don't just want to
know, what goals do you set?

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.279
I want to know what happens
when someone pisses you off

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:22.810
and you've got to forgive them.

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.610
What happens when
you fall down and you

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:26.980
don't know how to get back up?

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:27.730
What happens?

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.790
What happens when you start
leaving the people you love

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.340
based on your level of success?

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.070
How do you stay connected to
your community or your tribe

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.120
and still go after your dreams?

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.990
How do you get out
of a mindset that

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.020
says, I'm only going to have
this much success because I'm

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.930
a woman?

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.451
Because I'm a woman of color?

00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:47.950
Because I was born and raised
in South Central, or wherever?

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.540
Whatever that story
is that we make up,

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.350
how do I unleash
myself from that story

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.820
and hook myself to my future?

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:56.750
How do I do that?

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.640
Anybody else curious about that?

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.780
I just want to make sure
I'm in the right place.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.250
I don't need a lot of people,
I just need the right people.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.390
Because a lot of
the wrong people

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.765
are more distracting than a
few of the right people, yes?

00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:07.480
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.480
LISA NICHOLS: All right.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.380
So I was hungry.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.810
Like, I was hungry.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.790
People often want to
call me the exception.

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.590
Like, oh my god,
you're the exception.

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:17.730
No, I'm not the exception.

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.780
I'm an average,
ordinary woman who

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.560
chose every day to make one
more extraordinary decision.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.430
I'm an average
ordinary mom who said,

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.100
I want to drastically
transform my son's future.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.560
That he deserves to
have every option

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.939
that every other child
would have irregardless

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:35.980
of what he was born into.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.872
I just was crazy
enough to believe that.

00:05:38.872 --> 00:05:41.136
That it doesn't matter
the color of my skin,

00:05:41.136 --> 00:05:42.760
doesn't matter my
religious background,

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.120
doesn't matter my origin.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.535
It doesn't matter my mom's
bank account and my dad's bank

00:05:46.535 --> 00:05:47.534
account when I was born.

00:05:47.534 --> 00:05:49.680
None of that means my future.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.750
That's just the circumstance
that I came from.

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.710
That's not what
defines my future.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:54.950
I just believed that.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.730
Not a lot validated it.

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.840
But faith is believing
in the unseen anyway.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.490
So I had enough faith
to go, I know like I

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.000
know like I know like I know.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.200
I don't necessarily
have to see it yet.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.270
And so "Abundance Now" is--
it's the notes that I took.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.460
It's the things that I did.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:14.950
It's the lessons that I learned.

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.020
And then, some that I began
to adopt that I hadn't learned

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.520
that when I hit my head against
the wall enough, I realized,

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.430
don't do that.

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.910
Let me tell anyone who's
reading the book, don't do that.

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:27.200
That only looks sexy
and so not right.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.740
And so it really is-- this book
is designed to be disruptive.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.570
It's designed to disrupt
a couple of myths.

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.340
A few myths, three myths.

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.324
Myth number 1 is that we
believe that abundance--

00:06:39.324 --> 00:06:40.990
this is the part you
want to write down.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.040
We believe that abundance
is for some people.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.600
Some people of a certain
hue, a certain origin,

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.800
a certain background.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.622
And we teach that.

00:06:48.622 --> 00:06:50.080
Society just teaches
that, that you

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.140
have to come from this
place to have abundance.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.930
There's them and
then there's us.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:55.710
Yes, you guys?

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:56.210
OK.

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.570
By the way, I'm interactive.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:00.812
Like, I'm not here
just to do you.

00:07:00.812 --> 00:07:01.970
Just for the record.

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.845
Like, what I
learned is that I am

00:07:03.845 --> 00:07:06.100
a major part of my own rescue.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.044
I'm a major part of
my own breakthrough.

00:07:08.044 --> 00:07:09.460
So whether you're
here because you

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:10.850
want to get out of a
place of being stuck

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:11.640
or whether you're
here because you

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.660
want to go to the next
level of possibility,

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.560
you are part of that next level.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.810
So I'm going to ask questions.

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:18.665
I love a dialogue,
not a monologue.

00:07:18.665 --> 00:07:23.410
I am not a performer, though I
can be entertaining at times.

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:24.815
This is really about a dialogue.

00:07:24.815 --> 00:07:27.810
A juicy, delicious dialogue
that I hope on this day,

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.390
January 6, it created
some kind of shift in you.

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:33.390
Some kind of jolting where
afterwards you're like,

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:34.860
I think I just need
to do something

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:36.590
just-- I need to tweak this.

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:40.500
Not that anything's wrong, but
what does up-level look like?

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.240
What does next level look like?

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:46.450
And so the first myth is
that-- and when I say myth,

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:48.230
these are the things
you-- there's so much

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:50.060
value in what you unlearn.

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:53.950
Sometimes, the best thing you
can do is unlearn some things.

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:57.030
We're always going after
learning something new

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:58.460
because we're
information junkies.

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:01.240
Because we have all these
forms of information

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.990
coming at us on the internet,
coming at us in books,

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:06.421
coming at us on the radio,
coming at us in television,

00:08:06.421 --> 00:08:07.920
that we want to
learn, learn, learn.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.990
But sometimes your
biggest breakthrough

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:12.300
is in what you unlearn.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:13.660
And then you re-learn.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.710
Sometimes you have
to disrupt your soil.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:16.990
Pull your soil up.

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:20.187
Take that dry dirt that's
been planted for years.

00:08:20.187 --> 00:08:21.770
I've just been knowing
this for years.

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:22.810
This is what my
mother taught me.

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:24.143
This is what we've always known.

00:08:24.143 --> 00:08:26.530
You have to disrupt
that soil in order

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:29.850
to plant a new seed
to grow a new fruit.

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:30.830
Yeah?

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:31.910
You guys got that?

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:36.150
And so I came very comfortably
to disrupt your soil.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.245
That's what I came for,
to disrupt your soil.

00:08:38.245 --> 00:08:40.620
Not to necessarily keep you
comfortable on what you know.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:41.679
Stay comfortable in that.

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:44.150
I want to disrupt you in some
things that are new awareness

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:45.430
to go, oh, wait.

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:45.960
Hold on.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.630
Or a new awareness
about what you've

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:50.430
been doing based on what you've
known forever that doesn't

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:52.150
fit your future anymore.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:54.620
Because I can guarantee you,
every single one of us who

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.007
wants something different
than what we're getting,

00:08:57.007 --> 00:08:59.500
we're doing something
unconsciously

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.900
from old patterns that
doesn't even serve our future.

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:04.700
That's when the
tongue in your mouth

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.800
and the tongue in your shoe are
going in two totally different

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:08.780
directions.

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.890
And your job is to align them
up so that you can move forward

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:12.940
in a powerful way.

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.160
Yes, yes?

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.227
All right.

00:09:15.227 --> 00:09:16.810
When I say "yes,
yes," that's your cue

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:17.880
to say "yes, yes" back.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.000
That makes me feel
really good inside.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.050
Thank you so much
for your generosity.

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:24.250
Next time we all get
to say it louder.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:27.630
So myth number one is that
abundance is for some people,

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:29.154
it's not for everyone.

00:09:29.154 --> 00:09:30.820
You've got to come
from a certain origin

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.760
or have a certain background,
or whatever story we make up.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.860
And the truth is-- and
what I love about the truth

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:38.060
is the truth doesn't change
whether you accept it or not.

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:39.020
It's still the truth.

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:42.740
And so once you're made
aware from your unconscious

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:46.400
to your conscious of a truth,
live like you know that truth.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.480
And watch things change.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.310
Just live like you
know that truth.

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:51.790
A lot of times when
you learn a lesson

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:55.060
and you keep revisiting
that same pain,

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:58.630
it's because you're not living
like you learned the lesson.

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:01.680
How many of us, by show of
hands, have asked the question,

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.056
how did I end up here again?

00:10:05.056 --> 00:10:06.097
Raise your hands up high.

00:10:06.097 --> 00:10:07.010
Just make sure I'm
in the right room.

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:07.700
OK, great.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:11.379
It's because we forgot
we learned the lesson.

00:10:11.379 --> 00:10:13.170
So the universe, god,
whatever you call it,

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:15.267
had to give you
the lesson again.

00:10:15.267 --> 00:10:16.100
And then you go, OK.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:16.360
I got it.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:16.665
I got it.

00:10:16.665 --> 00:10:16.930
I got it.

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:17.400
I got it, right?

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:17.960
I've said that.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:18.310
I got it.

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:18.540
I got it.

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:19.040
I got it.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.630
OK, live like you
learned a lesson.

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:22.550
And then it won't
ever come again.

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:23.920
Same thing with the truth.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:27.240
When you live like you know
a new truth, or an old truth

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.857
that you didn't really
recognize you knew,

00:10:29.857 --> 00:10:31.440
when you live like
you know the truth,

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.320
your life will show up to
match that truth you know.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:39.360
So first truth, abundance
is available to everyone.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:43.087
Everyone, irregardless of your
culture, background, origin.

00:10:43.087 --> 00:10:44.170
No matter how you started.

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:46.650
Well, Lisa, what if I-- you
can do all the what-ifs.

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:48.290
It's still available to you.

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:50.052
Now, whether you
go get it or not.

00:10:50.052 --> 00:10:51.510
And oftentimes,
you don't go get it

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:53.330
because the story
you're telling yourself

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.780
doesn't agree with
what's available for you.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.310
And our stories are huge.

00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:59.090
Because your story
is your perception.

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:01.410
Your perception is your truth.

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:03.130
And you will live
into that perception

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:05.100
as if it is your truth.

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:08.940
Myth number two is that
abundance is singularly focused

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:13.210
on possessions and money.

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:15.580
It's all about what you
drive, what you live in,

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:16.820
how much money you make.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:20.820
When in fact, this couldn't
be further from the truth.

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:24.260
Wealth is possessions and money.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.786
Abundance is a 360 experience.

00:11:27.786 --> 00:11:29.450
[INAUDIBLE]

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:34.020
Abundance is a 360 experience.

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.310
True abundance.

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:37.915
True abundance is your health.

00:11:37.915 --> 00:11:39.540
Because if you don't
have great health,

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.830
life does not feel good.

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:43.800
Abundance is relationship.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.020
And at the end of your
life, literally you

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:48.320
will measure the
quality of your life

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:51.162
by the quality of the
relationships you had.

00:11:51.162 --> 00:11:52.620
All the other stuff
will fall away.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:53.880
That promotion you're
thinking about.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.296
You're wondering
about that raise.

00:11:55.296 --> 00:11:57.140
It will fall away in
an area of importance

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:58.350
when you get to the
end of your life.

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:00.360
You will begin to look at the
quality of your relationship.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.870
How are your children
relating to you?

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:03.180
How are your siblings
relating to you?

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:04.429
Do you have love in your life?

00:12:04.429 --> 00:12:07.250
You literally will start looking
at relationships at a higher

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:09.960
level as you get older.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:13.020
So when you mine them now,
you take care of them.

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:14.210
And I know that for a fact.

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:17.210
I have a friend who's
worth $14 billion.

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:21.245
Billion with a B. He was just
partying at my house all night

00:12:21.245 --> 00:12:22.120
long, wouldn't leave.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.660
4:00 in the morning, go home.

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:28.050
And he flew in from Canada
to go to my New Year's party

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:30.760
because he loves my
family connection

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.220
and he doesn't have one.

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.000
He is financially wealthy.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.810
He's relationship broke.

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:37.350
Does that make sense?

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:39.880
Abundance is a 360 experience.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.300
It's about relationships.

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:42.290
It's about health.

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:44.054
It's about your
spiritual groundedness.

00:12:44.054 --> 00:12:45.970
That doesn't mean you
have a religious origin.

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:47.280
It's about, can you release?

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.460
Can you forgive?

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:49.520
Can you let go?

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:50.660
Can you be still?

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:51.479
Do you meditate?

00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:52.770
Do you have time with yourself?

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:54.650
That has a lot to
do with the quality

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:57.540
of your life, that ability.

00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:59.050
And I talk about
this in the book.

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:01.740
And I'm a teacher,
so I give you ways

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.165
to enhance every area
that I'm talking about.

00:13:04.165 --> 00:13:05.540
I don't just
introduce it to you.

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:06.200
I go, listen.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.699
If you want to
strengthen this area,

00:13:07.699 --> 00:13:09.420
why don't you do these things?

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.560
So you'll find
page 58 is dynamic.

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.060
Page 265, dynamic.

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:15.020
Worth it.

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:17.750
And then the final
area is finance.

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:21.290
There are times where
it is about the money.

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:23.240
And people of
service, people who

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:26.450
are givers, people who are
natural lovers of life,

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:29.420
we sometimes don't want
to talk about the money.

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:33.430
Money is a dignified
conversation to have.

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:37.520
Matter of fact, you should do
very, very well financially.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:40.230
Because when good
people do well,

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:43.350
good people simply do
more good in the world.

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:45.080
Like, we could end hunger.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.750
We could end homelessness.

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:51.580
When enough good people do
well, we're now in power

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:54.270
financially to make
some major differences.

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:56.790
So money is a
dignified conversation.

00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:58.200
Money is a tool.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.720
Money is a team member.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:03.951
Money buys you access
to great memories.

00:14:03.951 --> 00:14:05.700
That's a different way
to look at it, huh?

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:07.030
Money is not the end game.

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:09.710
Money simply buys me
access to great memories.

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:11.530
Money buys me freedom.

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:15.000
I'm able to do more in life
now because I have more money.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.310
That's it.

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:18.810
I have access to
better memories.

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:23.620
My money bought me the memory of
my son at age 10-- he's now 21.

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:26.160
At age 10, standing on
top of one of the tallest

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.300
mountains in Kenya with
no front teeth saying,

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:32.500
Mommy, I'm on top of the
tallest mountain in Africa.

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:36.280
I still have that
memory burned in my head

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:39.010
because it was the first time I
took my son on a trip with me.

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:41.140
My money was able
to buy my son and I

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:44.180
surfing in Brisbane,
Australia this last May.

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:46.850
Yes, we surfed.

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:52.640
Mama was on a surfboard
for about 2.2 seconds.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.505
But I got it on video,
so it doesn't matter.

00:14:54.505 --> 00:14:55.380
I'm going to clip it.

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:58.530
And just add it together to
give myself about a good two

00:14:58.530 --> 00:14:59.680
minutes, right?

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.220
And so money allowed
me to jump out

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:03.980
of a plane with my
son in Australia.

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:05.563
It was on the Gold
Coast of Australia,

00:15:05.563 --> 00:15:07.360
and fly over the Gold
Coast of Australia.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.840
So money is not the end game.

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:09.460
It's a tool.

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:10.430
It's a team member.

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:13.584
It simply gives you access
to greater memories.

00:15:13.584 --> 00:15:15.250
When I invited my son
here to New York--

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:17.166
he's been wanting to
come to New York forever.

00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:18.717
Mom, New York, New York.

00:15:18.717 --> 00:15:19.550
I'm like, OK, great.

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:21.133
I'm going in January
for my book tour.

00:15:21.133 --> 00:15:22.250
He's like, January?

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:23.000
He's like, oh, no.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.130
That's when it's
cold there, right?

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:26.164
I was like, dude.

00:15:26.164 --> 00:15:27.080
I'm going to New York.

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:27.630
It's time to come.

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:28.296
He goes, oh, no.

00:15:28.296 --> 00:15:29.850
You'll be back.

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:31.290
It's that kind of
access he knows.

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:33.030
He goes, but Mom,
when you go to London,

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:35.500
I'm so with you no matter
what time of the year.

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:40.794
And that's the same kid that
I had to wrap in the towel.

00:15:40.794 --> 00:15:42.460
That's the sweetest
part of the memories

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:46.430
is that the story I get to
tell is transformational.

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:48.690
Because I was willing
to invest the pennies

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:51.780
in my pocket in my mind
so that my pocket can

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:54.500
overflow with something anew.

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.920
And so I'm here to
disrupt you a bit.

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.500
I'm here to make you
mildly, to moderately,

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:03.470
to significantly uncomfortable
and any form of mediocracy.

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:04.580
That's my agenda.

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:08.120
Because when someone loves us
enough to shake us up a bit

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:11.610
and make it uncomfortable
to do business as usual,

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:13.290
that's a favor.

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:14.950
That's a favor.

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:19.410
And I was so
uncomfortable in 1994,

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:24.660
that the last thing I wanted
was to do business as usual.

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:29.490
And so the book is my-- it's my
answering of the question I've

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:32.250
been asked so many
times, how did you do it?

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:35.510
And I would be unfair if
I just gave you one line.

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:37.880
There were many things I did.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.100
And when I look at my
life, I traveled the world.

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:43.200
I'm on the road over 310
days out of the year.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.050
And I don't mind.

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:46.780
Because 24 years
ago, I had a prayer.

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:49.000
God, I want to travel
the world, run my mouth,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.430
and autograph anything.

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:52.780
And now I'm like, update.

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:56.290
Travel the world half the time.

00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:58.330
And so I live my dreams.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:16:59.350
And perfect?

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:00.525
Far from that.

00:17:00.525 --> 00:17:02.650
But what I've learned how
to do is perfectly manage

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:04.490
my imperfection.

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:06.829
And accept it and
be at peace with it.

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:09.569
And then, find out
how we can bring out

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:11.579
the best in each other.

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:14.190
And so I stopped by Google.

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:19.560
Talk about the
law of attraction.

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:23.579
This is a full circle.

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:26.800
Five years ago, I opened my
offices for the first time.

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.790
I've been working out of my home
for 15 years in my little home

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:30.440
office.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:34.030
I started in a closet,
a walk-in closet.

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:36.560
Well, it wasn't really
a walk-all-the-way-in.

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:40.140
They should call some
closets step-in closet.

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:42.287
So it was a step-in
and turn around closet.

00:17:42.287 --> 00:17:44.870
And I put on the wall-- you know
those little handheld mirrors

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:48.220
you can get at the store, just
a little handheld, about $4.99?

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:50.170
I bought about 4 to
6 of those mirrors.

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:53.470
And I put those mirrors on the
wall in the walk-in closet.

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:56.330
So when I sat down,
it looked bigger.

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:59.630
And on the pant-- I
converted this walk-in closet

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:00.640
to my office.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:03.860
And I used pant hangers with
clips on them as my files.

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:07.270
So I clipped manila folders
on the pant hangers.

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:09.600
And I'd just slide my little
manila folders across.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:10.830
Put a little desk in there.

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:13.870
And I worked out
of that office--

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:17.100
out of that closet-- for four
years building my company.

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.510
Then, I graduated
to a little room

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:21.320
off the side of my bedroom.

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:25.197
Five years ago, I graduated
to a 3,500 square-foot office.

00:18:25.197 --> 00:18:26.280
To you guys, that's small.

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.430
But to me, that was
really, really, big.

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:30.860
Because it was a walk-in
closet at one time.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:36.600
And when I opened my offices,
I had about three employees.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:40.780
And now we're up to about
20, 25, 26 or something.

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:44.240
And still small in some people
standard, but big for me

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.870
on my own.

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:47.840
And when I started
my offices, and this

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.270
is my connection to Google.

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:50.936
I said I would tell
you this connection.

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.010
I watched a
documentary on Google.

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:58.240
And I really loved the
intention around making

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.760
the employees feel at home,
making them feel comfortable.

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:01.720
I loved that essence.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:05.250
I love the whole-- and I'll
probably butcher this up,

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:05.750
forgive me.

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:07.125
It's my first time
with you guys.

00:19:07.125 --> 00:19:09.160
But the whole food area.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:11.880
Like, oh my god, chefs
and food and cuisines.

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.560
And I was like, this is amazing.

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:15.020
Oh my god, they
can go in and eat.

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:15.686
This is amazing.

00:19:15.686 --> 00:19:19.110
How can I duplicate this
on my little budget?

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:22.250
And so my duplication, if ever
you should come to my office--

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:25.810
I invite you all
to visit my office.

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:27.990
You walk in my office--
and Carla can tell you,

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:29.310
she's on my team.

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:33.570
You walk in my office and
when you go into my kitchen,

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:38.470
my version of Google is
there's a shopping list.

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:39.900
And you can put
anything you want

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:41.760
to eat on the shopping list.

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:44.730
And we've stocked the
refrigerator every week

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:46.910
with fresh food that you choose.

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:51.997
And I have a George
Foreman, that's my chef.

00:19:51.997 --> 00:19:52.830
That's y'all's chef.

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:56.200
Our George Foreman
is y'all's chef.

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.980
And everything for breakfast,
everything for lunch,

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:01.060
everything for dinner
is in the cabinets

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:02.740
and in the refrigerator.

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:05.230
And if you want something,
just put it on the list

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:06.730
and I'll buy it for you.

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:07.540
And I model that.

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:09.610
And I tell everyone
whenever I'm giving a tour--

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:11.280
and I give tours a
lot in my office--

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:14.620
that I was inspired
by Google to do that.

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:17.260
So you got to start somewhere.

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:19.260
You've got to start somewhere.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.480
And so when I found out
that during our tour

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.610
I was coming to Google,
I was like, finally.

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:25.880
I get to actually see the real.

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:29.056
So when I leave here, I'm so
going over to your cafeteria.

00:20:29.056 --> 00:20:31.055
And I'm going to take
pictures in the cafeteria.

00:20:31.055 --> 00:20:33.620
And I'm going to put that
picture up in my office

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:36.780
so you guys will be--
your cafeteria will be

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:38.690
in my cafeteria-- the pictures.

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:40.750
So that I could
show the connection.

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:43.180
And I believe that when God--
when the universe brings

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:45.350
something within
your realm, that's

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:47.810
showing you that something
is available to you.

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:50.060
More than where you are,
or wherever you're going.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:52.060
But you've got to be
willing to dream big enough

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:53.360
to scare yourself.

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.170
If your dreams don't scare you,
you ain't dreaming big enough.

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:59.380
If you already know the how,
you're not dreaming big enough.

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:01.860
Your why should be
so big, your what

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.410
should be so big that
you sit back and go,

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:06.600
now how am I going do that?

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:07.320
Good.

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:08.970
It's finally big enough.

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:11.240
So many of us stop
dreaming big because we've

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.930
had some failures in the past.

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:14.920
Well, let me tell you
about abundant thinkers.

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:16.710
Abundant thinkers,
we give ourselves

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:19.620
permission to fail all the time.

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:23.330
We give ourselves permission
to fail all the time.

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:24.990
And let me tell you why.

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:27.720
Because when you give
yourself permission to fail,

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:31.740
you actually just gave
yourself permission to fly.

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:34.420
Because if you try to
avoid failure all the time,

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:36.860
you'll never take a leap.

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:40.420
And the moment you say, I'm
OK with whatever happens,

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:41.950
you'll take a leap.

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:46.760
I'd rather fall flying than
live a life on the edge

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:49.270
and never jumping off.

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:51.540
Because then you
get to 90 and go,

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:56.224
what would have happened
if I didn't play at 70%?

00:21:56.224 --> 00:21:58.390
And you got to watch out
for yourself because you're

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:00.430
so brilliant-- and
just raise your hand

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:06.230
if this is you-- that your 70%
looks like someone else's 159%.

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:07.840
Come on, you guys,
bust yourself out.

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:09.589
Don't just kind of put
it up a little bit.

00:22:09.589 --> 00:22:12.300
Put it all the way in the air.

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:13.160
The truth is sexy.

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:13.740
You're brilliant.

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:14.290
Raise your hand.

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:15.373
You know you're brilliant.

00:22:15.373 --> 00:22:17.360
You can see the
brilliance in the room.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.820
And you got to watch out,
because you can literally

00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:22.780
play at 70% and be impressive.

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:25.555
And yet, you know.

00:22:25.555 --> 00:22:27.650
And there's no one to
hold you accountable

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:31.030
because in your family circle,
you are the bomb dot com.

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:31.730
Like, woo.

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:33.180
They're bragging on you.

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:34.230
Works at Google.

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:34.730
Got it.

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:36.480
Made it out the
neighborhood, or whatever.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:39.050
In my neighborhood,
that's what they say.

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:41.100
And so you have to
constantly be holding

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:43.140
yourself accountable
to the version of you

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:44.962
that you desire to become.

00:22:44.962 --> 00:22:46.800
You have to constantly
keep yourself

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:48.830
at an environment
of other people

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:50.690
who are willing to
hold you accountable.

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:52.972
If you came here with
someone or there's someone

00:22:52.972 --> 00:22:54.430
back in your office
or someone back

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:56.589
in your community that
can hold you accountable,

00:22:56.589 --> 00:22:58.880
tell them the thing that
you're afraid to say out loud.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.830
And then follow it with,
please, hold me accountable

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:05.600
to the man, the woman that
I'm becoming, not to who I am.

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.540
Please don't be
impressed with my bio

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:09.060
because I already did that.

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:10.210
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:12.210
LISA NICHOLS: People look
at my bio and go, woo.

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:13.501
Don't spend a lot time on that.

00:23:13.501 --> 00:23:16.066
That's so '08.

00:23:16.066 --> 00:23:17.530
I already did that.

00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:20.270
Like, hold me accountable
to what is in my head

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:22.240
that I want to do in
the next 10 years.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.460
That's what I need
you to really know.

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:26.770
And so when you look at
that and you play that big.

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:28.150
And you're willing to stretch.

00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:30.090
And you're willing
to think ginormous.

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:32.430
Not big, not huge,
but ginormous.

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:33.940
And you're willing
to walk alone.

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:36.450
See, so many of us are afraid
of leaving someone behind,

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:37.860
we're afraid of walking alone.

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:40.250
Here's what I know
about a great vision.

00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:41.970
If someone else in
your life doesn't

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:45.330
get your vision-- and some
of you came just for this.

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:47.500
Everything else is bonus.

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:50.610
If someone in your life
doesn't get your vision,

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:53.940
if no one in your
life gets your vision,

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:58.865
it could be because God didn't
give your vision to them.

00:23:58.865 --> 00:24:00.240
And whatever you
call your faith.

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.670
I'm not here to impose
my belief system on you.

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:05.080
But your vision
was given to you.

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:06.307
And only you.

00:24:06.307 --> 00:24:08.640
So if you got to walk with
it and hold it and nurture it

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.870
for a while, be OK with that.

00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:14.610
That's like being impregnated
with something beautiful,

00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:16.910
but you want everyone else
to see it and describe it

00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:18.930
before you let it
out to the world.

00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:20.980
It's impossible physically.

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:23.170
Your job is to birth it.

00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:26.440
Now, you can be here
and still be creative.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:29.020
You can be here
and have a passion.

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:30.899
Inside the book, I talk
about the four E's.

00:24:30.899 --> 00:24:33.190
You all thought I was just
going to talk about the book

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:35.141
and read from the book?

00:24:35.141 --> 00:24:37.286
You all notice I didn't
even bring a book up here.

00:24:37.286 --> 00:24:39.089
Get the book, right?

00:24:39.089 --> 00:24:40.130
And then you've got both.

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:40.810
You all going to get the book.

00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:42.434
Don't just come for
a free conversation

00:24:42.434 --> 00:24:44.300
because this is
just the outskirts.

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:46.622
The book is the deep
dive of the how-to.

00:24:46.622 --> 00:24:48.580
This could be called
entertainment and a couple

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:49.520
a-has.

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.880
That's where you have
the breakthrough,

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.230
where you do the work.

00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:56.070
So many times, we don't
want to be inconvenienced

00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:58.500
by having-- we don't
want to be inconvenienced

00:24:58.500 --> 00:24:59.560
with our convictions.

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.500
Let me tell you, in order
to have something different

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:03.480
you are going to have to
do something different.

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:04.980
In order to have
something more, you

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:06.769
have to do something
you haven't done yet.

00:25:06.769 --> 00:25:08.310
I had to say the
things I didn't want

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:10.510
to say, do the things I
didn't feel like doing,

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:12.480
to have the life
I knew I wanted.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.860
Period.

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:16.270
Period.

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:18.330
And all I did was give
instructions for here, do

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:19.050
this bite size.

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:19.880
Do this bite size.

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.010
Do this bite size.

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:24.782
Bite size, digestible, palatable
pieces of what you can do.

00:25:24.782 --> 00:25:26.941
Does that sound good, you guys?

00:25:26.941 --> 00:25:28.440
And when you look
up-- and you don't

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:31.220
have to have a magnificent
change over 12 months.

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:32.649
Have a small change
over 30 days,

00:25:32.649 --> 00:25:34.190
and then a small
change over 30 days.

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:37.300
Your breakthrough will
come in needlepoint moves.

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:41.870
And you'll look up in five years
and not recognize your life.

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:44.520
And you need tools, because
you've gotten yourself

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.444
as far as you can get yourself.

00:25:46.444 --> 00:25:47.860
That was the best
thing I learned,

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:50.151
is that I'd taken myself as
far as I could take myself.

00:25:50.151 --> 00:25:51.990
I keep a coach in my life.

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:55.020
I keep a coach in every part
of my life that matters.

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:57.840
Right before we landed here,
I was in the car texting back

00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:59.340
my spiritual mentor.

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:00.760
And I have a business mentor.

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:03.135
And I have a health mentor
because those areas of my life

00:26:03.135 --> 00:26:05.480
really, really matter to me.

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:08.000
So get someone who's 2
to 10 steps ahead of you,

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.627
and then just say, give
me some bread crumbs.

00:26:10.627 --> 00:26:11.710
Give me some bread crumbs.

00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:12.509
I'm good.

00:26:12.509 --> 00:26:14.050
And so that's what
I did in the book.

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:14.932
I just said, here.

00:26:14.932 --> 00:26:16.640
If you're interested
in financial growth.

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.010
And I tell people,
skip to finances

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:19.210
if that's important for you.

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:20.918
Skip to relationships
if that's the thing

00:26:20.918 --> 00:26:25.720
you want to enhance,
build, heal, move through.

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:29.779
Skip to self-esteem, which
is called self-enrichment

00:26:29.779 --> 00:26:30.570
if that's the area.

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:32.140
You want to work
on your self-worth.

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:34.410
You want to work on your value.

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:37.170
You want to work on making
your yeses more powerful

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:40.802
and making your nos matter,
then skip to self-enrichment.

00:26:40.802 --> 00:26:42.010
Don't read the book in order.

00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:44.820
Read the book based
on how you need it.

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:45.650
Yes?

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:47.858
In three minutes, I'm going
to open up for questions.

00:26:47.858 --> 00:26:50.300
Your job is to have some
really great questions.

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:52.320
My job is to create an answer.

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.480
And here's the
guideline on questions.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.800
You can ask me anything.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.016
Say anything.

00:26:57.016 --> 00:26:57.890
AUDIENCE: Anything.

00:26:57.890 --> 00:26:59.330
LISA NICHOLS: You guys
ought to-- say anything.

00:26:59.330 --> 00:26:59.980
AUDIENCE: Anything.

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:01.105
LISA NICHOLS: Say anything.

00:27:01.105 --> 00:27:01.924
AUDIENCE: Anything.

00:27:01.924 --> 00:27:03.340
LISA NICHOLS: I
know you guys have

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:06.610
a corporate policy of corporate
correct of what you can ask.

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:08.380
I'm the author.

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:10.109
And I said what?

00:27:10.109 --> 00:27:10.900
AUDIENCE: Anything.

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:12.550
LISA NICHOLS: Anything.

00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:14.820
I'm committed to
your breakthrough.

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:16.840
Even if it's one person,
that's perfect for me.

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:19.850
That's an hour spent
well, if only one

00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:21.160
person has a breakthrough.

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.640
And sometimes, the
question you need to ask

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:26.680
is not the normal question
or the politically correct

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:27.210
question.

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:29.340
So there's no question
you could ask of me

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:31.140
that I feel is inappropriate.

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:32.082
There's none.

00:27:32.082 --> 00:27:33.040
Can we agree with that?

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:33.870
We all got that?

00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:35.600
Now, you choose the question.

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:37.970
And my job is to answer
you transparently.

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:40.480
Now, your job is to be
able to handle the answer.

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:43.260
Because I already had
to get used to it.

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:47.230
So in about two minutes,
we'll go into Q&amp;A.

00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:51.130
I just appeared on the "Steve
Harvey Show" yesterday.

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:56.284
And it's about my--
probably seventh time.

00:27:56.284 --> 00:27:58.450
Probably my seventh time
on the "Steve Harvey Show."

00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:00.450
I'm a resident coach on
the "Steve Harvey Show."

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:03.750
A resident coach on
"The Today Show."

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:05.890
And more on the
"Steve Harvey Show."

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:09.160
He and I have a relationship
that's pretty cool.

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:10.760
He hired me two years ago.

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:13.710
A year and a half ago, two years
ago, he hired me to coach him.

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:15.600
And I coached him
for a year and a half

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:18.770
on how to become an
inspirational speaker

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:21.602
and actually have a
division in his company

00:28:21.602 --> 00:28:23.060
that's a self-development
division.

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:24.351
He said, I want to use my name.

00:28:24.351 --> 00:28:26.300
I want to use my brand
to inspire people

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.310
now, not just make them laugh.

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:33.090
I feel like I owe it to
my fans to inspire them.

00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:35.580
And so I don't know if you
kind of saw about a year

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:39.310
and a half ago, he started
moving more-- sort of, kind of.

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:41.150
He's kind of hard to corral.

00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:44.100
But the intention was
that he would move more

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:45.640
toward inspirational speaking.

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:49.242
So I was on his show yesterday,
and I wasn't physically there.

00:28:49.242 --> 00:28:51.700
We recorded a couple weeks ago
because I was here yesterday

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:53.160
launching my book.

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:55.950
And one of the key
things was, how do I

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:57.790
shift my relationships?

00:28:57.790 --> 00:29:00.322
And you'll realize
that when you look

00:29:00.322 --> 00:29:01.780
at the quality of
your life, you're

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:03.710
going to look at
relationships and you're

00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:05.100
going to look at money.

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:08.720
Those are the two things that
absorb so much of our energy,

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.680
is money and relationships.

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:12.930
And one of the things I said
that in relationships, we

00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:16.320
make the mistake of thinking
we can change someone.

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.260
And thinking if they
just change like this,

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:19.952
they'll be OK with me.

00:29:19.952 --> 00:29:22.160
And the reality is, can you
love them where they are?

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:22.830
I see the giggles.

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:24.270
Can you love them
where they are?

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:25.936
If they never change,
can you love them?

00:29:25.936 --> 00:29:27.570
And if you say yes
to that, then you

00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:29.450
become more of an
inspiration for change

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:30.980
versus a push for change.

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:32.310
Does that make sense, you guys?

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:36.180
If you agree to love
them as is, then you

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:38.920
inspire change
versus push change.

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:42.800
And the second thing is-- and
these are the two key things

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:46.120
that I said on his show
yesterday, is relationships

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:49.260
begin to shift and go downhill
when you're more committed

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:53.380
to being right than you
are to being in harmony.

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:57.680
You forget that harmony is more
important than being right.

00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:01.780
That at the end of a debate,
discussion, argument,

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:04.560
most of the time all you
want to know is, am I right?

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.140
Was I right, though?

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:09.200
And yet, you've killed off the
relationship in that moment.

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:12.340
Now there's silent
dinners and silent hours

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:15.550
in the house when in fact you
just want to be reconnected.

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:18.440
So if you commit to
harmony over being right.

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:19.920
And then in finances--
and I always

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:21.211
like to leave people with this.

00:30:21.211 --> 00:30:22.400
I was just at "Essence."

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:28.564
I did an 8-station, 11-city
radio interview this morning.

00:30:28.564 --> 00:30:30.230
Then I left there and
went to "Essence."

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:31.855
Then I left there
and came to you guys.

00:30:31.855 --> 00:30:33.290
I'm just getting started.

00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:34.400
It's a day, right?

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.800
Wake up ready.

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:41.240
And over at "Essence," they
ask, can you talk about money?

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:43.830
Because money has such
an energy attached to it.

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:46.057
And I'm going to rattle
off some blueprints.

00:30:46.057 --> 00:30:47.890
You may want to write
this down because this

00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:51.150
was a big shift for me around
my mindset around money.

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:54.070
Number one, you won't ever
attract more money to you

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:57.040
until you become an even
greater steward of the money

00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.650
that you have.

00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:01.410
That when you mind your
pennies, dollars will flow.

00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:04.720
But if you are currently not
the best steward of the money

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:05.330
that you have.

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:07.946
Meaning you spend it
fast, you give it away,

00:31:07.946 --> 00:31:09.320
you don't know
how much you have,

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:10.820
then it's difficult
for the universe

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:13.319
to give you more of what you're
not taking risk [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:13.319 --> 00:31:16.010
Total and the highest level
of responsibility around.

00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:18.030
That's an ouch,
but it's the truth.

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:19.530
I kept wanting to
make more money,

00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:22.199
but I wasn't minding the
money I was making right.

00:31:22.199 --> 00:31:24.240
And when I began to mind--
because my mother used

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:26.370
to say money burns her pockets.

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:29.420
So I thought money was hot
and I had to spend it fast.

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:31.870
And once I learned how to
mind my existing money,

00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:34.030
all of a sudden I
began to have space

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:35.830
to attract more
money in my space.

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:38.680
So being a good steward
of your existing dollars

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:40.660
are very, very important,
because that will

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:45.126
bring about more prosperity.

00:31:45.126 --> 00:31:47.000
I don't want to say
wealth because prosperity

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.382
comes in many different forms.

00:31:48.382 --> 00:31:50.340
But there are several
blueprints that you have.

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:51.881
And I'm going to
rattle through these

00:31:51.881 --> 00:31:53.866
fast so that I can go into Q&amp;A.

00:31:53.866 --> 00:31:55.240
You have blueprints
around money.

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:57.274
And a blueprint is an
unconscious awareness

00:31:57.274 --> 00:31:58.940
you don't even know
you're listening to.

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:01.280
This is going to be
really interesting.

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:03.750
And I talk about this and
unpack this in the book.

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:04.880
Unpack this in the book.

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:07.736
I actually have you take
a financial assessment

00:32:07.736 --> 00:32:09.360
in the book so you
just can kind of see

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:10.590
where you are financially.

00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:12.840
You rate yourself, and
then you focus on the areas

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.881
that you didn't rate where
you wanted to rate at.

00:32:14.881 --> 00:32:18.050
It's a very personal,
powerful tool,

00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:19.350
the assessments in the book.

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:20.894
So your money blueprint.

00:32:20.894 --> 00:32:22.310
There are several
money blueprints

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:23.351
that you want to look at.

00:32:23.351 --> 00:32:26.440
One, you have a cultural
money blueprint.

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:28.600
The way your culture
relates to money

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:31.020
has a lot to do with how you
relate to money unconsciously

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:31.519
right now.

00:32:31.519 --> 00:32:32.420
Not even consciously.

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:36.040
But the way your culture--
my culture, my grandmother

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:38.830
could make a dime go in
20 different directions.

00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:40.550
And I called it a gift.

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:42.190
So it was my honor
to make a dime go

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:43.760
in 20 different directions.

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:47.900
So when I found myself
having 21 dimes,

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:50.620
it was actually more
of a problem to me.

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:52.240
Does that make sense, you guys?

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:54.970
Because I was so used to
culturally making my dime

00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:55.470
stretch.

00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:58.220
And all of a sudden, my
dime didn't have to stretch.

00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:03.990
When my company got to
$975,000, we were in October.

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:05.984
And I talk about money
openly because it only

00:33:05.984 --> 00:33:07.150
means what you make it mean.

00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:08.340
It doesn't mean a lot.

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:09.960
It's just a measure of work.

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.060
That's it.

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:14.150
When I got to $975,000,
it was in October.

00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:17.470
I stopped working
the rest of the year.

00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:19.750
I said I was tired.

00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:24.670
Then, the next year I got
to $982,000 by August.

00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:27.450
I wanted to stop working again
for the rest of the year.

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:29.500
It didn't make sense,
that was like six months.

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:31.770
So I was forced to
look at, why was I

00:33:31.770 --> 00:33:34.900
slowing down right before a
million dollars every year?

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:37.900
Because I was afraid that
if I made a million dollars,

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:42.230
it would change who I am as
a woman, as a woman of color,

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:43.472
as a black woman.

00:33:43.472 --> 00:33:45.430
My cousins were all
talking about robbing Peter

00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:46.020
to pay Paul.

00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:47.561
I wanted to stay in
the conversation.

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:51.980
As much as you want
to have success,

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:55.960
you want community more
than you want success.

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:58.689
And unconsciously, you can
start what I call moon walking.

00:33:58.689 --> 00:34:00.480
You look like you're
moving, but you're not

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:02.880
going anywhere because
you're afraid you

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.530
might be so different.

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:06.200
I don't know, I'm
just sharing with you.

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:07.824
These can be unconscious
conversations.

00:34:07.824 --> 00:34:09.330
I'm not implying this is you.

00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:11.300
I'm just telling you, these
are some things that happened.

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:12.049
It happened to me.

00:34:12.049 --> 00:34:13.270
It's happened to many people.

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:14.790
So culturally.

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:15.870
Gender-wise.

00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:18.580
You have a conversation around
money as it comes to gender.

00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:20.690
Men, your masculinity
is attached

00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:22.650
to how much money you
make, how successful

00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:24.880
you are, and your ability
to provide for your family.

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:27.940
Unfortunately, your masculinity
is attached to that.

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:28.966
Right or wrong.

00:34:28.966 --> 00:34:30.840
I'm not saying any of
this is right or wrong.

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:32.940
It's just how society has
put it out there to us.

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:35.100
And you take it on or you don't.

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:39.322
A woman, either you grow up
and get a good job or what?

00:34:39.322 --> 00:34:40.530
AUDIENCE: Marry a rich man.

00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:43.210
LISA NICHOLS: Or you marry a
rich man that has a good job.

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:46.170
Either you get a good job or you
get a good man with a good job.

00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:47.880
We're raised that way.

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:51.310
So I just want to show you some
society unconscious influences

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:52.520
that influence us.

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:55.382
And so even now, a woman
could be equally as qualified

00:34:55.382 --> 00:34:57.090
in the same role as
a man and she's still

00:34:57.090 --> 00:35:00.680
making less than a man
because we take that on.

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:01.950
Society's taking that on.

00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:02.980
Your next blueprint.

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:04.430
So there's culture blueprint.

00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:05.710
There's your gender blueprint.

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:07.900
The next is your
geographical blueprint.

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:10.520
How money was related
to in your community.

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:11.480
Was it a struggle?

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:12.617
Was it get or get got?

00:35:12.617 --> 00:35:13.950
Was it keep up with the Joneses?

00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:15.290
Was it fluid and flowing?

00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:18.400
Whatever that is, it's had an
impression on you around money.

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:21.480
I'm speaking to all of your
unconscious influences, you

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:22.590
guys.

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:24.840
And then, there's your economic.

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:26.150
Your economical blueprint.

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:29.170
How is money in your house?

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:30.690
Was it divisive?

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:32.040
Was it inclusive?

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:34.200
Did it buy the lifestyle
you wanted as a child?

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:36.490
Vacations with the family
and all that good stuff.

00:35:36.490 --> 00:35:38.200
Or, did it keep your
parents away because

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:40.330
they were always working
to provide money for you.

00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:42.460
Whatever your
economical blueprint was

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:43.970
is what you'll have.

00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:46.550
And then last is your
spiritual blueprint.

00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:48.862
However your
spiritual background

00:35:48.862 --> 00:35:50.070
or your religious background.

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:52.860
No matter, even if you move
from religious to spiritual,

00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:56.280
whatever your religious
blueprint was,

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:57.870
there are some
unconscious influence.

00:35:57.870 --> 00:36:01.080
Baptists-- ours, mine--
was you don't need money.

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.727
So that's why I stopped working
every time I got to that point

00:36:03.727 --> 00:36:05.560
because I felt like,
oh, I don't need money.

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:06.768
I don't need that much money.

00:36:06.768 --> 00:36:09.670
And so my spiritual
blueprint was really

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:12.380
influencing me until I
said, thank you so much,

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:14.046
but I've outgrown you.

00:36:14.046 --> 00:36:15.920
So I just want to bring
from your unconscious

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:18.890
to your conscious, so you
can say, I still choose it.

00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:21.520
Or thank you so much,
I've outgrown you.

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:22.590
Who has a question?

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:24.590
And if you can go
to the mic, that way

00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:28.080
you get your pretty
face on the camera.

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:29.110
Tell me your name first.

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:30.110
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Katie.

00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:30.660
LISA NICHOLS: Hi, Katie.

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:31.210
How are you?

00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:32.720
AUDIENCE: I am just great.

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:34.850
First of all, you were on
my vision board for 2016.

00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:36.559
So this year is off
to a fantastic start.

00:36:36.559 --> 00:36:37.725
LISA NICHOLS: Come on, girl.

00:36:37.725 --> 00:36:38.900
Check it off the list.

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:42.402
So can we take a picture and
replace my name with our photo?

00:36:42.402 --> 00:36:44.610
AUDIENCE: Oh, I was really
hoping you would say that.

00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:45.670
LISA NICHOLS: Absolutely.

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:47.010
You attracted that answer.

00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:50.569
And then cam you put it next
to what the word "done?"

00:36:50.569 --> 00:36:51.360
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:53.109
LISA NICHOLS: Because
we're result-driven.

00:36:53.109 --> 00:36:55.540
And every time we write
"done," you excite yourself.

00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:57.170
And then you go after the
next thing to write "done."

00:36:57.170 --> 00:36:59.092
You'll get so excited
with the word "done."

00:36:59.092 --> 00:37:01.300
AUDIENCE: I'm such a fan
girl, I can't even tell you.

00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:02.260
LISA NICHOLS: Amen.

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:03.430
AUDIENCE: So thank you
so much for coming.

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:03.870
LISA NICHOLS: You're welcome.

00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:05.870
AUDIENCE: And sharing
your wisdom and your love.

00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:06.870
It's amazing.

00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:09.120
One thing I've
been working on is

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:12.470
letting go of people,
beliefs, things

00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:14.050
that aren't serving me anymore.

00:37:14.050 --> 00:37:15.980
But I'm getting kind
of rigid with it.

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:18.240
So I wanted to know
if you had, either

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.740
any tips of what
you do in your life

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:22.040
to let go of those things that
just don't serve you anymore?

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:22.330
LISA NICHOLS: Right.

00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:23.427
Do you meditate?

00:37:23.427 --> 00:37:24.010
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:24.718
LISA NICHOLS: OK.

00:37:24.718 --> 00:37:26.130
So spend more time in that.

00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:31.470
And spend time inside your
still time reciting the words,

00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:32.620
it's all OK.

00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:37.634
It's all in flow to
hold onto and to let go.

00:37:37.634 --> 00:37:38.590
AUDIENCE: That's good.

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:39.673
LISA NICHOLS: It's all OK.

00:37:39.673 --> 00:37:42.540
It's all in flow to
hold onto and to let go.

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:44.170
So you hold as long
as you can hold.

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:46.300
And then when it's time
to let go, you'll let go.

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:47.954
So don't try to make
yourself let go,

00:37:47.954 --> 00:37:49.370
because now you're
focusing on it.

00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:51.690
And energy grows
where energy goes.

00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:52.800
So I need to let go.

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:55.360
No, just flow with it.

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:57.190
I'll let go when
it's time to let go.

00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:58.830
It's all in flow.

00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:01.300
So spend time in your
meditation focusing on that.

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:04.380
And then every time you let
go of something, celebrate it.

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:06.110
What gets celebrated
gets repeated.

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:07.540
We're all three-year-olds.

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:08.880
We're all three-year-olds.

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:10.565
What gets celebrated
gets repeated.

00:38:10.565 --> 00:38:12.190
And so every time
you let something go,

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:14.440
celebrate that you let it go.

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:16.050
Have your own little cupcake.

00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:17.424
Invite a friend over.

00:38:17.424 --> 00:38:19.840
When you let go of a habit,
when you let go of a behavior,

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:21.306
when you let go of a person.

00:38:21.306 --> 00:38:22.680
Any time you let
go of something,

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:24.555
celebrate it because
then you'll get excited.

00:38:24.555 --> 00:38:26.790
As excited as the word "done."

00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:27.290
Yes?

00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:27.830
AUDIENCE: That's awesome.

00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:28.330
Yes, yes.

00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:29.600
Thank you.

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:30.600
LISA NICHOLS: I love it.

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:31.310
Thank you.

00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:31.810
Thank you.

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:33.210
I'm excited for our picture.

00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:34.310
AUDIENCE: Hi, Lisa.

00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:34.840
LISA NICHOLS: Hi, beautiful.

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:36.215
AUDIENCE: So for
those of you who

00:38:36.215 --> 00:38:38.490
didn't know, when I walked
in here, I bought the book.

00:38:38.490 --> 00:38:41.070
And Lisa came up to me
and said, great book.

00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:41.794
I said, really?

00:38:41.794 --> 00:38:43.460
LISA NICHOLS: You
should read that book.

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:44.440
She didn't know it
was me because I

00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:46.010
look a little different, right?

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:47.757
She looked at me like, really?

00:38:47.757 --> 00:38:48.340
I said, it is.

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:48.999
It's good.

00:38:48.999 --> 00:38:50.790
And I could tell she
didn't know it was me.

00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:51.970
I was like, but I'm so bad.

00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:52.803
I shouldn't do that.

00:38:52.803 --> 00:38:53.800
But it's so much fun.

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:55.789
AUDIENCE: And then I
got a selfie with her.

00:38:55.789 --> 00:38:58.330
LISA NICHOLS: I figured I owed
her a selfie because I totally

00:38:58.330 --> 00:38:59.290
tricked her.

00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:01.890
AUDIENCE: So my question to you
is I love all of this wisdom.

00:39:01.890 --> 00:39:03.240
I'm a lifelong learner.

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:05.650
And it's so nice to see that
you're out there coaching

00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:07.590
because so many of us need it.

00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:10.980
How do you make that
transformation stick?

00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:13.710
I love coming to these lectures,
and listening and saying,

00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:14.740
I'm going to do it.

00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:16.280
And then you
realize you get back

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:18.160
to your old original habits.

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:20.580
How do you suggest we actually
take that transformation

00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:21.440
in our lives?

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:23.540
LISA NICHOLS: So Joan
Baez says that action

00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:26.160
is the antidote for despair.

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:30.510
And Lisa Nichols adds, action
is the prescription for success.

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:33.010
So in between these
wonderful lectures,

00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:35.130
get in radical action.

00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:38.590
Which is why I say get an
accountability partner.

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:41.384
You will be 80% more likely to
achieve your goal if you have

00:39:41.384 --> 00:39:43.300
an accountability partner
because you will not

00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:45.510
be the weakest link.

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:46.229
Right?

00:39:46.229 --> 00:39:48.270
So you don't have anyone
holding you accountable.

00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:50.690
Who holds giants accountable?

00:39:50.690 --> 00:39:52.840
Like, who holds us accountable?

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:54.854
That's why I spent that
whole time on that.

00:39:54.854 --> 00:39:56.270
Have someone hold
you accountable.

00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:57.740
Share the thing you
don't want to share

00:39:57.740 --> 00:40:00.240
with them that you're up to
that you really want to achieve.

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.930
And then the last
thing is to make

00:40:01.930 --> 00:40:06.310
bite-size, digestible, palatable
moments of achievement.

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:09.320
Abundant thinkers don't
look at the macro win.

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:11.800
We focus on the micro win.

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:17.860
So have nine micro wins to
get you to one macro win.

00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:20.020
See, everyone's making
New Year resolutions now,

00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:23.080
and that's a macro win
with no micro win set up.

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:26.190
So by March, you don't
even want to talk about it.

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:28.540
Like, you're mad if I
bring up your goal that you

00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:30.175
set on January 1 by March.

00:40:30.175 --> 00:40:31.800
That's because you
didn't have anything

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:34.330
for the second week of January,
the third week of January.

00:40:34.330 --> 00:40:36.490
Every goal I have, I go detail.

00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:37.850
And I'm a creator.

00:40:37.850 --> 00:40:39.630
So I'm not linear
detail line, but I've

00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:41.480
become that way as a CEO.

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:43.985
And so Carla can tell you,
every time we set a goal.

00:40:43.985 --> 00:40:45.360
I go, OK, back me
into that goal.

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:46.880
How will it be attained?

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:49.640
Show me every single step
that will get us there.

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:53.240
Every single micro-step
that will get us there.

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:55.670
And then, every fourth
step, let's celebrate.

00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:56.704
That's our milestone.

00:40:56.704 --> 00:40:58.370
Every fourth step,
that's our milestone.

00:40:58.370 --> 00:40:59.120
Every fourth step.

00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:00.180
And we celebrate.

00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:02.040
Woo-hoo, we're a quarter
of the way there.

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:04.470
Because we'll celebrate,
it gets repeated.

00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:06.960
So you probably don't have
enough milestones or action

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:09.740
steps, micro wins
inside of a macro win.

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:11.870
And you don't have
enough action in between.

00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:14.152
And you probably don't have
an accountability buddy.

00:41:14.152 --> 00:41:16.610
And all of that-- and that
great book I told you was great.

00:41:16.610 --> 00:41:17.772
I mean, I told you.

00:41:17.772 --> 00:41:18.730
All of that's in there.

00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:20.230
And you deep dive in that.

00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:23.040
Don't learn any more,
just do something.

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.060
Don't learn.

00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:26.120
If you say I'm not
going to learn any more,

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:29.240
I'm going to go back and apply
the things I learned for 2016.

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:32.040
Let 2016 be a deep dive of
what you've already learned.

00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:33.690
Just learn one more
thing, that book.

00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:34.750
That's it.

00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:35.810
And then, do it.

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:36.710
And then do it.

00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:38.790
My pastor told me once
when I was 21 years old,

00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:41.680
she said people want to quote
scriptures all the time.

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:43.170
She said, do yourself a favor.

00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:45.500
Live one.

00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:46.830
Don't start quoting a lot.

00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:47.700
Live one.

00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:50.049
And I figured it's the same
way for a passage in a book.

00:41:50.049 --> 00:41:51.590
Don't just learn a
passage in a book.

00:41:51.590 --> 00:41:52.690
Live it.

00:41:52.690 --> 00:41:55.400
And then learn it
and live it again.

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:57.440
And how will your life
be different if you just

00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:00.000
learn 12 different things?

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.910
You're now living 12
different things in your life.

00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:04.180
So that's the answer.

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:07.020
And thank you for
letting me play with you.

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:08.920
And we got a selfie.

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:09.739
Yes, beautiful.

00:42:09.739 --> 00:42:10.280
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:10.779
How are you?

00:42:10.779 --> 00:42:11.720
My name is Stephanie.

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:13.335
LISA NICHOLS: Hi, Stephanie.

00:42:13.335 --> 00:42:14.710
AUDIENCE: So many
things that you

00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:17.330
have said have resonated with
me, that it's like scary.

00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:19.716
Like, you are talking
about my life.

00:42:19.716 --> 00:42:25.870
Like, particularly my 60
is other people's 150.

00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:27.865
And so when I talk
about specific goals

00:42:27.865 --> 00:42:29.670
to certain people
in my life-- family,

00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:32.480
friends-- it's kind of
like, you already made it.

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:35.670
You got a good job, husband,
kids, the whole thing.

00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:36.480
Like, you're set.

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:38.050
Like, what more do you want?

00:42:38.050 --> 00:42:40.880
You're living this
golden life, basically.

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:43.690
But always inside
I'm just like, eh.

00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:45.057
It's all right.

00:42:45.057 --> 00:42:45.890
LISA NICHOLS: Right.

00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:51.260
AUDIENCE: And so for months
now-- more than months, years,

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:56.170
I have this deep-rooted
need to travel.

00:42:56.170 --> 00:42:59.520
And so I try to make it
possible as much as I can.

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:01.930
And I have two kids,
another on the way.

00:43:01.930 --> 00:43:06.445
And I'm like, how do I
make it work with the kids?

00:43:06.445 --> 00:43:07.810
I'll put them on my back.

00:43:07.810 --> 00:43:08.910
They can come with me.

00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:11.740
Me and my husband can
work this out together.

00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:15.420
And so I started doing the
research of reading about blogs

00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:17.970
on families who travel.

00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:20.435
Travel the world
for years at a time.

00:43:20.435 --> 00:43:22.800
And so I'm like, ugh.

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:23.500
That's a lot.

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:25.760
I read the blogs, and
then I put it down.

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:30.260
And literally, within the last
48 hours, I read another one.

00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:33.200
And I sat down with my
husband just this morning

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:35.550
and I spoke it into
existence to him.

00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:37.320
I was like, 2020 is our year.

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:40.500
Our kids will be four,
eight, and 10 at that time.

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:43.000
And we have four
years to come up

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.410
with a plan of how we're
going to school them,

00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:48.090
come up with a plan of
what we'll do on the road

00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:49.520
to continue to make money.

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:51.270
I'll be at Google for six years.

00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:54.600
Google [INAUDIBLE],
like all of this stuff.

00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:55.500
I was scared.

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:59.120
I was scared to find out
what his reaction was,

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:01.610
if he'd be down for it.

00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:05.250
And I was scared of speaking
it, like 2020 is so far.

00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:06.280
Things can happen.

00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:08.190
I was doubting myself.

00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:09.520
And on the train, I felt it.

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:11.495
And I called him and we
were talking about it.

00:44:11.495 --> 00:44:12.930
And I was like, I
can't be scared.

00:44:12.930 --> 00:44:13.950
You just have to plan.

00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:17.090
Because what if in four
years nothing bad happened,

00:44:17.090 --> 00:44:19.180
and then I wasted four
years not planning

00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:22.090
this amazing experience?

00:44:22.090 --> 00:44:25.080
And so my husband and
I, we agreed on it.

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:26.810
We declared it this morning.

00:44:26.810 --> 00:44:27.947
And I come to you--

00:44:27.947 --> 00:44:30.280
LISA NICHOLS: And I'm just
here to affirm it all, right?

00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:30.680
AUDIENCE: Exactly.

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:32.290
LISA NICHOLS: And to give
you some tools and some skill

00:44:32.290 --> 00:44:33.730
sets to make it happen.

00:44:33.730 --> 00:44:35.580
AUDIENCE: And so
that's my question.

00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:38.670
Like OK, I'm ready to
make the commitment.

00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:41.940
But what's the next
step for tomorrow?

00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:42.980
LISA NICHOLS: Sure.

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:44.570
So first, tell me
your name again.

00:44:44.570 --> 00:44:45.070
AUDIENCE: Stephanie.

00:44:45.070 --> 00:44:45.520
LISA NICHOLS: Stephanie.

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:46.550
So first, Stephanie.

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:47.735
I want to celebrate you.

00:44:47.735 --> 00:44:48.569
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:48.569 --> 00:44:50.235
LISA NICHOLS: Celebrate
you for doing it

00:44:50.235 --> 00:44:52.700
with your knees knocking
and your teeth chattering.

00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:56.520
Because we often wait for the
fear to go away to take action.

00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:59.640
And when you realize that
fear is actually your friend,

00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:01.240
fear is not an enemy.

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:03.480
I love disrupting
things like this.

00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:05.610
Fear is only your
enemy when you allow

00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:07.820
it to paralyze your movement.

00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:10.330
But fear will get you up early.

00:45:10.330 --> 00:45:12.470
Fear will make you
do your research.

00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:14.090
Fear will humble you out.

00:45:14.090 --> 00:45:16.010
Fear will have you ask for help.

00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:18.530
Fear is your friend
when you use it

00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:20.294
to inform you of what you need.

00:45:20.294 --> 00:45:22.710
Whenever I'm afraid-- and I
stay afraid because I'm always

00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:23.520
playing so frigging big.

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:24.061
I'm like, ah.

00:45:24.061 --> 00:45:25.750
How are we going to do that?

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:27.600
Haven't I been playing
big ever since I

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:28.950
signed with Harper on his book.

00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:30.640
Like, we're going to do this
and we're going to do that.

00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:33.650
And then I go home and go, how
are we going to do all that?

00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:35.050
So fear feeds you.

00:45:35.050 --> 00:45:37.620
So one, I want to celebrate you
for moving afraid and sharing

00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:38.570
with your husband.

00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:43.810
Secondly, I want to remind you--
and I say this respectfully,

00:45:43.810 --> 00:45:48.340
don't share your million dollar
dreams with dollar thinkers.

00:45:52.115 --> 00:45:52.740
She's like, mm.

00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:55.760
I'm going to write that down.

00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:59.100
Like, be selective who you
share your million dollar

00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:00.060
dreams with.

00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:01.770
Share them, but share
them with people

00:46:01.770 --> 00:46:03.604
who are going to put
helium in your balloon.

00:46:03.604 --> 00:46:05.353
Don't share them with
people who are going

00:46:05.353 --> 00:46:06.640
to try to throw a pin at it.

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:09.690
Like, why would I expose
my dream balloon to someone

00:46:09.690 --> 00:46:11.551
with a bunch of darts?

00:46:11.551 --> 00:46:13.940
It doesn't say we don't
love them any less.

00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:16.450
But based on where they're
dreaming and thinking,

00:46:16.450 --> 00:46:19.980
they have to see the evidence
before it becomes real.

00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:24.820
My company was named Motivating
the Masses in 1992, you guys.

00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:28.370
I didn't even touch
the masses until 2008.

00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:30.860
That's how long it was my dream.

00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:33.100
No one even knew I had the
company name in my family

00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:36.167
because they only knew I had
motivating the team spirit.

00:46:36.167 --> 00:46:38.000
Because they could see
me working wit teams.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.610
But I had Motivating the
Masses over there in the cut.

00:46:40.610 --> 00:46:43.336
And I would tell the people
who can hold that dream.

00:46:43.336 --> 00:46:45.460
And they would constantly
put helium in that dream.

00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:47.850
And when I was on
Oprah-- I kid you

00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:52.120
not, I was on Oprah talking
about "The Secret" in 2007.

00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:55.667
And when I went home, my family
said, we're angry at you.

00:46:55.667 --> 00:46:57.000
I said, why are you angry at me?

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.130
Because you're keeping
some kind of secret.

00:47:00.130 --> 00:47:02.510
That's what they knew
about "The Secret."

00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:05.430
I said no, that's a book.

00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:06.090
That's a video.

00:47:06.090 --> 00:47:07.890
They're like, what?

00:47:07.890 --> 00:47:10.280
I was like, I gave you the
book, like two years ago.

00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:11.080
They were like, oh.

00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:13.790
Girl, I ain't opened that.

00:47:13.790 --> 00:47:15.800
I could tell.

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:20.370
So I selectively choose who you
share that million dollar dream

00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:22.812
with, first of all, so that
you don't feel deflated.

00:47:22.812 --> 00:47:24.520
Have you ever shared
a dream with someone

00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:26.910
and the dream buster just came,
swooped in, and started busting

00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:28.330
the dream, and you were afraid?

00:47:28.330 --> 00:47:30.620
And it made you kind of doubt
the dream a little more.

00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:31.340
No, no, no.

00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:33.370
Don't make me doubt my dream.

00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:35.740
So your job is to share
with the right people.

00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:38.130
And not people who
can't dream that

00:47:38.130 --> 00:47:40.630
be responsible for
celebrating your dream.

00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:43.340
That's unfair for you to do.

00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:45.370
That's number one.

00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:47.520
And number two, I
love where you are.

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:49.940
Make a clear, concrete plan.

00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:50.950
Don't do some day.

00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:52.920
I want the next time I
see you, talk to you.

00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:54.580
Come on, follow me on Facebook.

00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:55.950
Talk to me in my email.

00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:58.164
I want to know the day
you start traveling.

00:47:58.164 --> 00:47:59.830
AUDIENCE: I already
started planning it.

00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:02.830
I would have New Year's
at my home in 2019,

00:48:02.830 --> 00:48:04.850
so it will be a send off.

00:48:04.850 --> 00:48:06.960
LISA NICHOLS: So January 1.

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:07.520
OK.

00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:09.680
So then I want to
know-- watch this.

00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:10.460
Level of clarity.

00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:14.220
So ambiguous goals bring
about ambiguous results.

00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:17.200
But when you get to a new level
of crystal clarity, watch this.

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:19.660
Tell me the day you
start traveling.

00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:22.840
Tell me the airline
you're going to choose.

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:24.260
Tell me the flight number.

00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:26.385
I don't care if the flight
number changes, but pick

00:48:26.385 --> 00:48:27.760
a flight to the location.

00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:31.430
And choose that flight number.

00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:34.902
Take a picture of the luggage
that you're going to use.

00:48:34.902 --> 00:48:37.110
Take a picture of the way
you're going to make money,

00:48:37.110 --> 00:48:39.580
even if someone else is
making that kind of money now,

00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:40.720
of how they're making it.

00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:42.620
Put all that inside
your reality book.

00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:44.920
Not your dream book,
in your reality book.

00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:46.840
Get so crystal clear.

00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:48.040
Share it with your husband.

00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:49.140
Share it with their children.

00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:50.090
Start talking about things.

00:48:50.090 --> 00:48:51.020
Where are you going to travel?

00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:53.436
Get a postcard from the first
place you're going to go to?

00:48:53.436 --> 00:48:54.140
Like, order it.

00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:55.292
Go somewhere and find them.

00:48:55.292 --> 00:48:56.750
And bring them into
your existence.

00:48:56.750 --> 00:48:59.100
Start eating it, breathe
it, walk it, talk it.

00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:02.715
When you sweat, it
comes from your pores.

00:49:02.715 --> 00:49:03.840
So that's all you're doing.

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:05.423
You'll start drawing
it to you faster.

00:49:05.423 --> 00:49:07.910
You'll start building
up momentum toward it

00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:09.090
when you do that.

00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:10.180
And then, get an action.

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:11.300
And then one of
the first things.

00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:13.174
It's going to take you
four years to do this.

00:49:13.174 --> 00:49:16.992
Find out, how much does it
cost to buy your freedom?

00:49:16.992 --> 00:49:18.950
I found out how much it
cost to buy my freedom.

00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:20.950
I was working for LA
Unified School District.

00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:24.920
And my first check I
wrote to myself was $110.

00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:25.880
It's in the book.

00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:28.810
Just follow what I do in the
book about buying your freedom.

00:49:28.810 --> 00:49:31.260
I wrote a check to
myself for $110.

00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:34.650
I put in the memo line
"funding my dream."

00:49:34.650 --> 00:49:36.560
I wasn't even clear
what the dream was.

00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:39.130
And I wrote a check to
myself every two weeks

00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:42.470
for 3 and 1/2 years,
almost four years.

00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:46.870
And on the 3 and 1/2 years,
I walked into Wells Fargo.

00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:48.370
And I said, my name
is Lisa Nichols.

00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:49.001
They said, oh.

00:49:49.001 --> 00:49:50.500
Because I used to
mail the check in.

00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:51.950
And I wouldn't
open the statements

00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:53.320
because I was afraid
I'd spend the money if I

00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:54.232
opened the statement.

00:49:54.232 --> 00:49:56.190
Because my mother said
money burned her pocket,

00:49:56.190 --> 00:49:57.320
so I don't want it
to burn my pocket.

00:49:57.320 --> 00:49:59.920
So if I didn't know-- you got
to trick yourself sometimes,

00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:00.430
right?

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:02.360
So I said, if I don't know,
I'm not going to spend it.

00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:03.507
So I went into Wells Fargo.

00:50:03.507 --> 00:50:04.840
I said, my name is Lisa Nichols.

00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:05.964
I came to check my balance.

00:50:05.964 --> 00:50:08.210
They said, you're the
funding my dream lady.

00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:11.810
Because I wrote that every time,
every two weeks in the memo

00:50:11.810 --> 00:50:13.360
line for 3 and 1/2 years.

00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:15.390
And they all ran
around the teller.

00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:16.510
And I said, yes, I am.

00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:18.350
They said, we've got a question.

00:50:18.350 --> 00:50:19.290
Managers came around.

00:50:19.290 --> 00:50:22.310
They said, what's
the dream, right?

00:50:22.310 --> 00:50:25.070
And I said, my son
was 5 and 1/2 then.

00:50:25.070 --> 00:50:27.370
I started when he was two.

00:50:27.370 --> 00:50:29.144
I said, I'm not sure.

00:50:29.144 --> 00:50:30.810
Oh my god, I'm going
to make myself cry.

00:50:30.810 --> 00:50:33.080
I said, I'm not sure,
but it has something

00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:34.405
to do with inspiring people.

00:50:34.405 --> 00:50:37.830
Excuse me, inspiring people
all around the world.

00:50:37.830 --> 00:50:40.600
And I said, I just came
to check my balance.

00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:43.650
They wrote the balance
down, turned it around.

00:50:43.650 --> 00:50:46.635
And it said $62,500.

00:50:46.635 --> 00:50:48.510
I turned it back around,
gave it back to her.

00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:52.212
I said, my social
security is 549-67--

00:50:52.212 --> 00:50:53.420
I don't even want that money.

00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:54.379
It's not my money.

00:50:54.379 --> 00:50:55.670
Y'all going to ask for it back.

00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:56.990
I know that's not for me.

00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:59.950
My family has never
had $5,000 in the bank.

00:50:59.950 --> 00:51:02.350
I know I don't have $62,000.

00:51:02.350 --> 00:51:03.463
And they teared up.

00:51:03.463 --> 00:51:05.460
I teared up.

00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:09.000
And they said, Ms.
Nichols, you have $62,500.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.620
What are you going
to do with it?

00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:13.889
And I said, I don't know, but
my dream gets funded today.

00:51:13.889 --> 00:51:14.930
And that's how I started.

00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:16.490
So you're on the
right path, sweetie.

00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:16.810
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:51:16.810 --> 00:51:17.670
Thank you so much.

00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:18.878
LISA NICHOLS: You're welcome.

00:51:18.878 --> 00:51:20.012
Give her a hand.

00:51:20.012 --> 00:51:21.840
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:24.730
So my goal was to
come and just do

00:51:24.730 --> 00:51:27.160
a little or a lot of disruption.

00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:30.071
My goal was to stir
something in your soul,

00:51:30.071 --> 00:51:31.570
to make you stretch
a little further

00:51:31.570 --> 00:51:34.570
into the magnificent
future that belongs to you.

00:51:34.570 --> 00:51:36.720
It belongs to you by birthright.

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:39.800
"Abundance Now" is not
abundance later, abundance

00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:41.390
when you get it all
right, abundance

00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:44.110
when you-- it's abundance now.

00:51:44.110 --> 00:51:46.750
Like, what better time than now?

00:51:46.750 --> 00:51:48.879
And so I just stopped
by to inspire you.

00:51:48.879 --> 00:51:49.920
I'm going to hang around.

00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:50.920
I'm going to sign books.

00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:52.420
I'm going to take some pictures.

00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:55.720
And hopefully, create just
a little needlepoint move

00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:57.510
in the trajectory of your life.

00:51:57.510 --> 00:52:00.292
And in the future, you don't
have to remember my name.

00:52:00.292 --> 00:52:02.000
You don't have to
remember anything, just

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.490
remember the moment you
made the decision for you.

00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:06.050
Because that's what matters.

00:52:06.050 --> 00:52:10.360
Your life is more
valuable to the people

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:13.860
that it inspires than it
will actually ever be to you.

00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:17.280
Like, your job is to inspire
someone beyond belief.

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:19.480
That lives forever.

00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:22.940
Your legacy will live much
longer than your life span.

00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:26.570
And our job is to write a great
life to have a great legacy

00:52:26.570 --> 00:52:28.300
to inspire many people.

00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:29.300
And anyone can do it.

00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:32.070
I'm just a woman from
South Central LA,

00:52:32.070 --> 00:52:34.600
between the Harlem Crip
30's and the Rollin 60's,

00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:36.450
who got a C plus in school.

00:52:36.450 --> 00:52:38.880
In 12 years, that
was my highest grade.

00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:40.844
The last time I took
English, I got a fail.

00:52:40.844 --> 00:52:43.510
And my English teacher told me I
was the weakest writer she ever

00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:45.730
met in her entire life.

00:52:45.730 --> 00:52:48.680
And the last time-- right, I
should send her a book, right?

00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:48.960
AUDIENCE: Autograph.

00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:50.335
LISA NICHOLS: With
my face on it.

00:52:50.335 --> 00:52:51.380
Right, autographed.

00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:53.170
Some of your best
motivation does not

00:52:53.170 --> 00:52:54.290
come wrapped in a red bow.

00:52:54.290 --> 00:52:56.270
It comes wrapped in sandpaper.

00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:58.490
You get to use
everything as fuel.

00:52:58.490 --> 00:53:02.361
The last time I took a speech
class, I got a D minus.

00:53:02.361 --> 00:53:04.110
And my speech teacher
said, quote unquote,

00:53:04.110 --> 00:53:08.630
"Ms. Nichols, I recommend
you never speak in public."

00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:10.120
Some of your best
motivation might

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:12.220
come wrapped in sandpaper.

00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:16.790
I just stopped by to disrupt
you a bit, to inspire you a bit,

00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:18.742
and to hold on and
love you a bit.

00:53:18.742 --> 00:53:20.200
I hope it's been
good for you guys,

00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:21.290
because it's definitely
been good for me.

00:53:21.290 --> 00:53:21.790
Thank you.

00:53:21.790 --> 00:53:23.140
[APPLAUSE]
