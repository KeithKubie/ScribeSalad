ANDREW BROGDON: If you've
used AdMob Mediation,

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.678
you've seen this
little slider that

00:00:09.678 --> 00:00:12.599
says Optimize when you set
up your Mediation config.

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.640
Typically, there's some
additional input elements

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.550
asking for things like
API keys or OAuth tokens,

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.920
and you may have thought,
what's the big whoop?

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.830
Why do I need to bother
chasing down all those keys?

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.600
Well, it's actually
a very big whoop.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.330
By hitting that slider
and entering the values,

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.400
you give AdMob the
ability to figure out

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.369
what that mediated network is
paying you-- real live dollars

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.480
and cents.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.120
With that information,
AdMob can order the networks

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.210
you hit for you based on
what you're actually earning,

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.580
which helps you maximize your
revenue for each impression.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.940
So the next time you're
setting up a Mediation group,

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.520
make sure you've got network
optimization turned on.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.972
You'll be making AdMob smarter
and better able to help

00:00:49.972 --> 00:00:51.180
you get the revenue you need.
