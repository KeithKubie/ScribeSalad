00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.280
It could, on the surface, be an argument about
almost anything: what time to leave for the

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.320
airport, who forgot to post the tax form,
where to send the children to school… But,

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:22.839
in reality, in disguise, unmentioned and unmentionable,
it is typically the very same argument, the

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:28.600
no-sex argument, the single greatest argument
that ever afflicts committed couples, the

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.601
argument which has powered more furious oblique
exchanges among lovers than any other, the

00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:38.620
argument that right now, explains why one
person is angrily refusing to speak to another

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.760
over a bowl of Udon noodles in a restaurant
in downtown Yokohama and another is screaming

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.940
in an apartment on an upper floor of a block
in the suburbs of Belo Horizonte, why a child

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.859
has acquired a step-parent and a person is
crying over a bottle or at their therapist’s

00:00:54.859 --> 00:01:00.160
office. The real injury – you have ceased
to want me and I can no longer bear myself

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:06.020
or you – can’t be mentioned because it
cuts us too deep; it threatens too much of

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.799
our dignity, it is bigger than we are. In
the darkness late at night, time after time,

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:18.171
our hand moved towards theirs, tried to coax
them into a caress and was turned down. They

00:01:18.171 --> 00:01:23.770
held our fingers limply for a moment and then,
as if we were the monster we now take ourselves

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:30.350
to be, curled away from us and disappeared
into the warren of sleep. We have stopped

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.799
trying now. It may happen once in a blue moon,
a few times a year, but we understand the

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:43.399
score well enough: we are not wanted. We feel
like outcasts, the only ones to be rejected

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:49.710
in this way, the victims of a rare disease;
nursing an emotional injury far too shaming

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.010
to mention to others let alone ourselves,
the only ones not be having sex in a happy

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:03.030
sex-filled world. Our anger aggravates our
injury and traps us in cycles of hostility.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.300
Perhaps they don’t want us in the night
because we have been so vile in the day; but

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.129
so long as our hand goes unwanted, we can
never muster the courage to be anything but

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:19.090
vindictive in their presence. It hurts more
than being single, when at least the neglect

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.700
was to be expected. This is a sentence without
end. We can neither complain, nor let the

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.890
issue go. We feel compelled to fight by proxy
about anything we can lay our hands on: the

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.450
washing powder and the walk to the park, the
money for the dentist and the course of the

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.489
nation’s politics, all because we so badly
need to be held and to hold, to penetrate

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.680
or to be penetrated.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.980
It is in a sense deeply strange, even silly
that so much should hang on this issue, that

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.190
the future of families, the fate of children,
the division of assets, the survival of a

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.209
friendship group, should depend on the right
sort of frottage of a few centimetres of our

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:06.200
upper limbs. It’s the tiniest thing and
at the same time the very largest. The absence

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.370
of sex matters so much because sex itself
is the supreme conciliator and salve of all

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:19.120
conflict, ill-feeling, loneliness and disinterest.
It is almost impossible to make love and be

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.470
sad, indifferent or bitter. Furious perhaps,
in a passionate and ardent way. But not – almost

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:32.850
always – truly elsewhere or beset by major
grievance. The act forces presence, vulnerability,

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.980
honesty, tenderness, release. It matters inordinately
because it is the ultimate proof that everything

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:46.379
is, despite everything, still OK. As ever,
so much would change if only we could be helped

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:51.849
to find the words, if we could fight our way
past our shame, if we didn’t have to feel

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:54.590
so alone (this should be proof enough that
we aren’t); if we could point to the problem

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.959
without fury, without humiliation, without
defensiveness; if we could simply name our

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:05.540
desperation without becoming desperate, if
the one who didn’t want it could explain

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:11.480
in terms that made sense and were bearable
and the one who felt cast aside could explain

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.580
without surrendering to vindictiveness or
despair. We would ideally, alongside physics

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:21.050
and geography, learn the basics of all this
in our last year at high school, learn how

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:26.860
to spot and assuage the no-sex argument with
an in-depth course and regular refreshments

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.810
throughout our lives. It is the paradigm of
all arguments. Those who can get over it can

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.940
get over pretty much any dispute; those who
cannot must squabble to the grave. Were our

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.851
species to learn how to do this, the world
would be suddenly and decisively calmer: there

00:04:43.851 --> 00:04:50.260
would be infinitely fewer fights, alcoholic
outbursts, divorces, affairs, rages, denunciations,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:55.460
recriminations, civil wars, armed conflicts
and nuclear conflagrations. At the first signs

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.380
of no-sex arguments, couples would know how
carefully to locate the words that could address

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.340
their sorrow. There would not always be an
answer but there would always be the right

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.400
sort of conversation – and, on a good day,
the endurance of love.
