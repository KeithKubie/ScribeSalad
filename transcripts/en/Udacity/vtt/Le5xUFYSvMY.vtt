00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.150
Alright Michael. I'm going to define a new concept

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.110
for you. It is called the NASH EQUILIBRIUM.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.750
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.180
&gt;&gt; Okay, here's the set up. You have n players. So we move beyond simply

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.310
two players. You have n players. And

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.149
each player has strategies that it can chose

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:20.530
from. So here I'm referring to them as, S1, these are all the strategies for

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:25.630
player one. As two are all the strategies for player two up to S N

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.010
all the players for strategy N. Got it?

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.850
&gt;&gt; Yep. Okay so each of these are set, so im

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.900
going to say that the particular strategies, S1 star S2 star

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.530
S3 star, so on and so forth as N star that

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.110
is a strategy that each of the N players has chosen.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.880
&gt;&gt; Is in a Nash equilibrium if and only if for each one of those strategies

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.990
chosen by the n players it is the strategy

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.960
that maximizes the utility for that particular player, it

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.150
is the strategy that maximize the utility for that

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.300
particular player Given all the other strategies that were

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.670
chosen. Now I actually find that difficult to kind

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.950
of work through, so let me try to say

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.720
it a different way. Given that you have a

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.120
set of strategies as one star, as two star,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.850
as three star, as n star. We know that they

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.170
are in Nash equilibrium, if and only if. If you randomly

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.230
chose one of the players, and gave them the chance to

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.780
switch their strategy, they would have no reason to do it.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.360
&gt;&gt; Interesting, okay.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.510
&gt;&gt; So does that make sense?

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:35.130
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.290
&gt;&gt; Right. So an equilibrium right, just in general, the word, the word sort

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.850
of makes sense, right, an equilibrium is

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.439
at a place where everything is balanced.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.920
And in some sense, there's no reason

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.550
for anything to move because they're in balance.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.650
So we set that a set of strategies are a Nash Equilibrium if no one person

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.940
has any reason to change their strategy

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.890
in a world where everyone else's strategy remains

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.490
the same. Then you're, then you're in equilibrium,

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.270
and in particular you're in a Nash equilibrium.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.650
&gt;&gt; Nash equilibrium. Okay good.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.050
&gt;&gt; Do you know who Nash is?

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.770
&gt;&gt; Ogden Nash was a poet.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.508
&gt;&gt; Not that Nash.

00:02:10.508 --> 00:02:13.660
&gt;&gt; I think there was a TV series with a Nash in it.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.690
&gt;&gt; Yes there was.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.120
&gt;&gt; But you're thinking of John Nash.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.550
&gt;&gt; That's right The Nobel Prize winning person who

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.320
was the, was featured in the movie A Beautiful Mind.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.260
&gt;&gt; Yep, that's exactly right. And it

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.140
was, in fact, a Beautiful Equilibrium. Okay,

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.690
so, there's the notion of a Nash Equilibrium. It was admitted by John Nash,

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.870
if you believe the movie, in order to pick up women. Which

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.880
I, you know, you know I never, I've never seen this movie.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.850
&gt;&gt; Oh really? Oh, I watched it and it was, it was

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.640
surprising how unhelpful it was in explaining what a Nash Equilibrium was.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.140
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm not surprised. I hope this is helpful, though. So,

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.060
it really is a kind of difficult concept to completely wrap your, your

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.070
mind around, but what it really boils down to is, listen, if

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.710
we all picked a bunch of strategies and we knew that one other

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.500
person, one of us, we don't know who before hand, but we know

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.570
that one of us Would have the opportunity to change their strategy after they

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.310
see what everyone else's strategy is. We'd be in a nash equilibrium only

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.850
if that person, whoever that person is, has no reason to change their strategy.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.010
&gt;&gt; Gotcha. So, so specifically you've made a distinction

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.670
between strategies that were pure and strategies that were mixed.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:21.030
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.970
&gt;&gt; And I guess I don't see in this case which kind we're talking about.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:24.630
&gt;&gt; Right. So,

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.302
in this particular case, we're talking about. Pure

00:03:27.302 --> 00:03:32.000
strategies; however, exactly this wording works with mixed strategies.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.490
&gt;&gt; Oh, I see. So you could have

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.250
a pure Nash equilibrium or a mixed Nash equilibrium.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.810
&gt;&gt; Right. And so, you could, each one of these, instead

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.790
of choosing a particular strategy and saying they're a Nash equilibrium, you

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.070
could talk about a probability dristribution over each of these sets of

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.630
strategies and say those are Nash equilibrium if. No one would want

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.090
to change their probability distribution.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.900
&gt;&gt; Got it.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.190
&gt;&gt; So this works for both pure and

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.994
mixed. Alright, so you think you understand this?

00:03:56.994 --> 00:04:00.050
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] sure.

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:01.650
&gt;&gt; Good, we will test that.
