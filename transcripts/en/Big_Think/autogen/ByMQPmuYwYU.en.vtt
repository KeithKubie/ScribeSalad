00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.690
newest data is that in people under age
40 women are just as adulterous as men

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700
40 women are just as adulterous as men
 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.949
40 women are just as adulterous as men
and so I suspect that the last 10,000

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959
and so I suspect that the last 10,000
 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.990
and so I suspect that the last 10,000
years of keeping women in the kitchen

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000
years of keeping women in the kitchen
 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.830
years of keeping women in the kitchen
and the and the the home has and the

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840
and the and the the home has and the
 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.750
and the and the the home has and the
very strict rules against female

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760
very strict rules against female
 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.020
very strict rules against female
adultery in many societies has curbed

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030
adultery in many societies has curbed
 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.400
adultery in many societies has curbed
female adultery so that we think that

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410
female adultery so that we think that
 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.039
female adultery so that we think that
only men do it but the bottom line is

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049
only men do it but the bottom line is
 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.500
only men do it but the bottom line is
that every single time there's a man who

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510
that every single time there's a man who
 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.599
that every single time there's a man who
was sleeping around he is quite often

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609
was sleeping around he is quite often
 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.629
was sleeping around he is quite often
sleeping around with a woman and so just

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639
sleeping around with a woman and so just
 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.340
sleeping around with a woman and so just
doing the math and you begin to assume

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350
doing the math and you begin to assume
 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.810
doing the math and you begin to assume
that women are probably just as

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820
that women are probably just as
 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.730
that women are probably just as
adulterous as men but I actually think

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740
adulterous as men but I actually think
 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:31.870
adulterous as men but I actually think
that men and women are in sort of

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880
that men and women are in sort of
 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.940
that men and women are in sort of
collusion about this men want to think

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950
collusion about this men want to think
 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.279
collusion about this men want to think
that men are more adulterous than women

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:36.289
that men are more adulterous than women
 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:38.020
that men are more adulterous than women
and I think that women want men to think

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030
and I think that women want men to think
 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.180
and I think that women want men to think
that men are more adults than women so

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190
that men are more adults than women so
 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.460
that men are more adults than women so
we've we've got ourselves believing that

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470
we've we've got ourselves believing that
 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.040
we've we've got ourselves believing that
men are more notice there's a great deal

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050
men are more notice there's a great deal
 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.589
men are more notice there's a great deal

of data over the last Oh data goes back
 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:50.140

that men are more adulterous and what's
 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.460
that men are more adulterous and what's
interesting is that the degree of
