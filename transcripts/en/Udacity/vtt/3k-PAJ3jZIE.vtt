00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.220
efficiency of health care.

In the age of the internet, where we're
all used to information any time and

00:00:16.443 --> 00:00:21.640
any place, you would probably think that
once health care records are digital,

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.180
exchanging them would be easy.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.220

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.520

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.110
skewed incentives within our
complex health care system.
