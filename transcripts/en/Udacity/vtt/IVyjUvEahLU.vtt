If I wanted to type x is less than or equal to 3, I would type in on my keyboard

00:00:05.792 --> 00:00:11.761
x, a backslash symbol, the letters l, e, and then a space. Right after you hit

00:00:11.773 --> 00:00:17.199
the space, the backslash and the le will transform into a less than or equal to

00:00:17.211 --> 00:00:21.555
sign and that's also what this letter stand for, less than or equal to. If you

00:00:21.567 --> 00:00:26.022
don't type in a space after these characters, then nothing will happen. Once you

00:00:26.034 --> 00:00:30.117
have entered a space you can continue typing. I would just set 3 to get x is

00:00:30.117 --> 00:00:34.002
less than or equal to 3. I have greater than or equal to symbol works in a

00:00:34.014 --> 00:00:38.630
similar way. You would type backslash then ge, and the space. You're going to

00:00:38.642 --> 00:00:42.715
have a chance to practice that here and here, just by typing in what I have

00:00:42.727 --> 00:00:46.825
written here. And then as a challenge to you, you'll be able to try these 2

00:00:46.837 --> 00:00:51.115
inequalities. Notice that they contain an infinity symbol. For the infinity

00:00:51.127 --> 00:00:55.261
symbol, you simply need to type in a backslash and then the letters inf and a

00:00:55.273 --> 00:00:59.735
space. The space again will transofrm these characters into your infinity

00:00:59.747 --> 00:01:04.190
symbol. For this infinity, it's negative. So, I put a negative sign in front

00:01:04.202 --> 00:01:08.645
first. This is just the minus sign or the dash on your keyboard. Try playing

00:01:08.657 --> 00:01:13.180
around with your keyboard and see if you can get these same math expressions

00:01:13.282 --> 00:01:15.175
using MathQuill. It's pretty cool.
