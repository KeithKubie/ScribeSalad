&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.390
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: So
welcome, everybody.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.940
Thank you for coming, today.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.240
I am Fenella France.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.360
I'm the chief of the Preservation
Research and Testing Division.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.940
And along with Preservation
Reformatting, we're delighted

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.950
to invite our speaker for
the talk's lecture today.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.360
Olivia Dill received her BA
in physics and art history

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.830
for UC Berkley in 2014, and she's
currently a project specialist

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.880
for the UC Berkley IRENE Project.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.360
For those of you who don't know,
IRENE is Image, Reconstruct,

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.340
Erase Noise, et cetera, not someone
who sits in the back of the lab.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.230
And she's working on maintaining
and operating the workstation,

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.650
digitizing 3000 wax
cylinders in the Hearst Museum

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.610
of Anthropology collections.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.710
She designed the mass digitization
workflow for the project

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.680
and developed and updated much of
the acquisition code and software.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.330
We'd like to actually say
thanks to NEH and NSF grant

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.660
for documenting endangered
languages.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.400
And her talk today is Analyzing
Images to Digitize Sound

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.130
on Historic Audio Recordings.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.510
Olivia, please.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.090
[ Applause ]

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.540
&gt;&gt; Olivia Dill: Hi and thank
you for having me here today

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.910
and thank you all for coming.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.470
My name as was said is
Olivia Dill and I work

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.380
for the UC Berkeley Library.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.490
I'm running a lab that's using
optical scanning to digitize audio

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.390
on wax cylinder sound recordings.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.810
Optical scanning is a method
that's developing now and is used

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.430
to digitize the content on early
mechanical sound recordings using

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.240
images of the media rather than
contact with their surfaces.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.130
The method may be familiar
to many of you here

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.250 position:56%
as the technology has been developed
with a strong collaboration

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.080
between the Library of Congress

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.380
and Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory over the last decade.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.460
But today, I'm here to
discuss its latest application

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.250 position:56%
which is the project that I work on.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.340
Our project whose title
you'll see here at the top

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.000
of the screen is a three-year
project funded by a grant

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.640
from the National Science
Foundation and National Endowment

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.480
for the Humanities Documenting
Endangered Languages Program.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.290
Our goal is over three years
to create digital versions

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.410
of the audio record on
around 3000 wax cylinders

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.090
in the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.770
of Anthropology collection using
this optical scanning technique.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.250
And today, I'll be walking you

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.010
through how the optical
scanning method works in general,

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.210
how we're applying it for this
project and the future directions

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.900
and implications that we
see this project taking.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.320
So the method that we're using
was developed with the aim

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.970
of increasing access to media

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.340
from the early history
of sound recording.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.950
Sound was first recorded
in 1859 and the materials

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.820
on which sound was recorded around
this time were oftentimes delicate

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.820
and have only become more delicate
in the year since their recording.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.200
The optical scanning technology
is non-contact and image-based,

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.180
so it allows us to play back

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.450
and preserve these historic sound
recordings in different formats

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.670
and in different states
of stability.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.880 position:56%
The method has been used to play
back some of the earliest recordings

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.500
in history on collections
of different media

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.170
across the country and abroad.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.880
And my project, the mass
digitization of cylinders

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.930
in the Hearst Museum collection,
is just the latest application,

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.190
the newest iteration
of this technique.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.150
So a fundamental very
basic place to start is

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.710
with the question what
is a wax cylinder?

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.440
But in order to really answer that,
we have to take a step backwards

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.400 position:56%
and answer the even more fundamental
question of what is sound.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.340
Sound is a motion-based effect.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.530
It is the result of
particles compressing

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.550
and rarefacting repeatedly as
they travel through some medium.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.140
And this creates oscillating
areas of high and low pressure.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.350
Two of the main properties that
we use to perceive a sound--

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.780
to perceive sound are a
sound wave's volume and pitch

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.750
and how those two properties
change over time.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.730
The amplitude of oscillation
translates to the volume

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.260 position:56%
of the sound and the frequency at
which particles oscillate translates

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.020
to the perceived pitch
or tone of the sound.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.900
And the feat of these of these
early sound recordings is

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.310
to create a retrievable trace
of that amplitude and frequency

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.330
of oscillations and
how they're changing

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.090
in time on some physical medium.

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.810
So a wax cylinder is
exactly what it sounds like.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.740
It's a cylinder that's
made out of wax.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.440
They're typically about
four to six inches tall

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.410
and two inches in diameter.

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.040 position:56%
The wax itself is hard but malleable
enough to be easily scraped away.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.780 position:56%
And so to record sound onto a wax
cylinder, a small needle or a cutter

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.160
on a machine called a phonograph
is inserted into the wax

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.290
and the cylinder is spun
underneath the cutter.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.830
The cutter drags along the surface
of the cylinder, removing wax

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.290
and leaving a groove behind it.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.530 position:56%
Every time the cylinder completes
one revolution, the cutter is forced

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.290
by the recording machine to move
over by some small set amount

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.070
and this creates one
long continuous spiral

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.390
down the length of
the entire cylinder.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.360
To actually record audio, a speaker
speaks into a horn on a phonograph

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.850
that collects the sound waves
being produced and transfer thems--

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.710
transfers them through a coupling
mechanism in the recording device

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.220
to the cutter, and this drives
the cutter to bob up and down,

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.100
changing the depth of the
groove that it's cutting.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.170
To play back the audio,
you just carry

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:30.860
out this process in the reverse.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.350
A playback stylus on the phonograph
is coupled to the horn instead

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.170
of the cutter and the stylus
is placed in the grooves

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.080
so that it rests along
the groove bottom.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.590
And then the cylinder is rotated.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.500
And as the cylinder rotates,

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.870
the stylus drags along the
groove bottom, retracing the path

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.750
of the original cutter, recreating
its vertical oscillation,

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.340
and with that vertical motion, the
original audio that was recorded.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.580
And so, then that means,
with that physical intuition,

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.310
we can understand that the
physical trace that sound leaves

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.850 position:56%
on the surface of the wax cylinder
which is the link to the information

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:08.090 position:56%
that we want to recover from it is
the shape of the cylinder's surface,

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.270
and specifically the shape of the--

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.570
the shape of the groove

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.270
and the changing height
of the groove bottom.

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.710
The relevant scale on which this
occurs is micrometers or microns.

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.260
One micron is one one-thousandth
of a millimeter.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.310
For scale, the average human hair
is going to be around 50 microns.

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.740
The needles on the recording
devices and the grooves

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:34.530
that they cut are typically
a few hundreds microns wide

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.630
and their vertical
oscillation is going to be

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.390
around 10 microns from
top to bottom.

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:42.210
So the vertical displacement
that creates audio is small.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.660
It's about one-fifth of a
human hair but it's measurable.

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:50.680
This technology was
first invented in 1877.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.510
And by 1890, a device called
the Edison phonograph had become

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.030
commercially available
in a reasonably easy

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.140
to operate, transportable form.

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.870
Anthropologists, linguists,
ethnographers

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.610
and other academics
studying language

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.110
and oration saw the
phonograph as an opportunity

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.940
to more efficiently capture
the songs and the languages

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.100
that they had previously been
transcribing all by hand.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.570
So they took to the new technology

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:18.220
and they quickly incorporated
it into their research.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.980
And during the years of the
phonographs, initial popularity,

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:24.370
many scholars across the US
and around the world engaged

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:27.070
in dedicated campaigns where
they went out into field,

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.060
engaged with indigenous groups

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:33.520
to record their languages producing
tens of thousands of recordings.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.390
And the collection that I'm
working with for the Hearst Museum

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:41.090 position:56%
of Anthropology is the result of one
of these field recording campaigns.

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:42.810
The cylinders in the Hearst Museum

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:46.120
of Anthropology collection were
collected by Alfred Kroeber

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.880
who was the founded of-- founder

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:51.470
of the UC Berkley Anthropology
Department.

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:54.130
He and his students
collected them as part

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:59.000
of an extensive ethnographic survey
of Native Californian cultures.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.100
Over 39 years, starting
in 1900, Kroeber

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.650
and his students traveled
throughout California

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:10.800
and collected 2746 separate
recordings of Native Californians.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.130
The content of these
recordings varies.

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:18.010
They contain both song and
speech in 78 different languages.

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:21.320
They record things like dance
songs, descriptions of activities,

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.750
medicinal songs, myths,
creation stories, histories,

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:28.600
among other important things.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.830
These anthropologists who collected
these recordings envisioned

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:34.930
themselves as building a
research resource for linguists

00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:37.990
and anthropologists
and others in academia,

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:40.700
and the collection
certainly still is that today.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:44.830
But today, it has also become
valuable to community members

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:47.890
who are oftentimes
contemporary members of the tribes

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:51.780
that are recorded, and in
many cases, direct descendants

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:55.130
of the actual people
recorded on the cylinders.

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:57.980
Many of the languages recorded
have transformed or fallen

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.720
out of widespread spoken
use since recording,

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.480
so the collection has become a
valuable resource for language

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.250
and cultural revitalization
projects.

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:10.700
Until now, collection engagement
has been through transfers made

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:14.320
in the 80s onto reel to reel
tape using the traditional method

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.490
of playback which is
the hard stylus.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:21.300
But these transfers do not
include broken cylinders.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:25.430 position:56%
The quality of the audio often makes
content difficult to understand.

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:28.400
And most have not been
converted to digital formats.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.500
So the logistics of actually
getting them to the people

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:34.560 position:56%
that are interested in them are
difficult, time-consuming and costly

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.650
for both the patron
and for the museum.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:42.460
The cylinders themselves, in many
cases, have been broken or cracked

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:46.130
and have become prone-- more
prone to breaking with age.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:49.490
And the surface of the cylinders is
being eaten away by a type of mold

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:53.120 position:56%
that thrives on wax and lives in
the linings of the original housings

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.350
in which the cylinders were stored.

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:57.670
So the overall picture
that we're looking at is,

00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:00.820
that the Hearst Museum collection
is unique, it's invaluable both

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.200
to community members
and to scholars.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.000
But the results of previous
transfers are difficult

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.190
to create access to, and any method

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:11.930
of creating new transfers must
be able to cope with artifacts

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:14.210
in delicate and decaying condition,

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:17.530
and that's where the
optical method comes in.

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:21.290
The optical method uses a
physics-based understanding

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:24.190
of the mechanics of sound
and recording devices coupled

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:26.500 position:56%
with a physicist training and making

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.730
and interpreting precision
measurements of observables,

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:32.590
to measure the physical traces
of the recording process

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:35.410
and recreate the audio
that made them.

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:38.230
The optical method asks
two questions of materials.

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:42.390
First, can we measure the surface
of the media without touching it

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:45.570
in a way that allows us to create
a sufficiently detailed image

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:47.310
of that surface?

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:50.090
And second, can we display that
image in a way that allows us

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:54.470
to systematically analyze it,
recreate the playback process

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:57.150
and recover the sound
from the recording?

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:59.160
Digitizing recordings,
through this process,

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.170
answers a lot of the problems
that come up in dealing

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:03.510
with these collections
of sound recordings.

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:06.280
The only physical demand on
objects is that they be maneuvered

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.580
and have light shown on them,

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.280
so this opens up access
to delicate materials.

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:13.500
The method is computer-based which
allows the process to be automated

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.670
and carried out systematically
for many recordings.

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:20.600
And the method works in images
and more over detailed images

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.140
which provides information
about the condition of objects

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:26.090
that can't be had simply
by playing them back.

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:29.590
And also, using this method
eliminates the need to maintain

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:32.150
and operate outdated
recording devices.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:35.520
In the Hearst Museum case,
there are 3000 cylinders

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:40.670
to be digitized approximately,
with funding from the NSF and NEH

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:43.740
that was scheduled to
last for three years.

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:46.200
In assessing how plausible
the optical method is

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.140
for our collection, we considered
relevant dimensions of cylinders,

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.540
what measures we would
need and how precisely

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:55.670
and quickly the performance
speculations--

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:57.600
or specifications rather

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.380 position:56%
of available measuring devices would
allow us to make those measurements.

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:03.430
For wax cylinders, we
use a confocal probe

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:06.230
that collects height measurements
along the line on the surface.

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:08.870
And pilot studies for this project
showed us that we could work

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:12.710
within the needs of that
prove and collect data

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:16.210
with sufficient accuracy to
give us the images that we need.

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:19.400 position:56%
Furthermore, the rate at which the
probe could collect measurements was

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.980
high enough that the time taken to
scan each cylinder would allow us

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.490
to scan the requisite
six cylinders per day

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:27.900
to remain on our project timeline.

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.830
And so, given the condition of the
cylinders, the number that we have

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:32.810
to work with, the technical
capabilities

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:37.210
of available measuring devices and
the desired format specifications

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:40.450
for the final audio, the optical
method was the method that we chose

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:43.080
to digitize our collection.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:47.260
So in order to actually apply this,
we developed and applied a workflow

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.440
to systemically work through
the cylinders in the collection.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.710
For each of the 3000
cylinders to be digitized,

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:56.790
we need to work clockwise
around this graphic.

00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:01.270
First, we make many hundreds
of thousands of measurements

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:03.920
of the height of the
surface of the cylinder.

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.500
Then we stitch them together

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.800
to make a high-resolution
three-dimensional map

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.310
at the surface.

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:12.640
That map is then loaded into a
piece of software that displays it,

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.070 position:56%
calculates how the stylus would have
moved over the surface and then uses

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:18.690
that information to
create an audio waveform.

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:21.260
The audio is written out
to a separate digital file,

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.890
the map itself can be archived
and reprocessed later as needed.

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:29.940
So to actually implement this,
the first half of the process is

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:32.600
to acquire the necessary data.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:36.340
For wax cylinders, we use a
confocal microscope or probe.

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:39.000
It's a tool that collects
height measurements along a line

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.210
on a surface, when that surface
is within a set focal distance.

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:46.570
The probe-- How the probe
works is it shines white light

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:51.090
through a series of lenses, and
those lenses break the white light

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:54.790
into its constituent
wavelengths, such that each color

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:57.110
of light focuses at
a different height.

00:13:57.110 --> 00:14:00.790 position:56%
Then when you place a surface within
that focal range of the probe,

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:05.940 position:56%
the surface is going to be at the
height where one color isn't focused

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:07.930
and the rest are out of focus.

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:10.780
And so the color that's in
focus reflects directly up back

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:14.090
where it came from and
the rest scatter of.

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:19.040
And so the probe also collects
the light that's reflected

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.250
from the surface, analyzes it
to tell what color is in focus.

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:25.750
And from that, can measure the
distance to the surface in front

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:29.220
of it to an accuracy of
around 75 nanometers,

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:32.460
and that accuracy is more than
enough to resolve the shapes

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:35.430
that are relevant on the
wax cylinder surface.

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.520
The probe does this
shining and analyzing

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.600
at 180 points along a
line, across the surface

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:44.510
and outputs a list
of 180 height values.

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:47.660
If you take this probe and you
point it at a wax cylinder surface,

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:50.340
you'll see the image
on the upper right.

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:52.510
And what you're seeing is
this very regular pattern

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:54.710
of peaks and valleys.

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:59.050 position:56%
And the way to read this is that the
probe is shining a light on a line

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:02.920
that lands on the surface of
the cylinder across the groove.

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:06.630 position:56%
As the groove winds around cylinder,
it intersects that line many times.

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:09.990
And so the many valleys are in many
sections at the same groove bottom

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:13.630
and the peaks are the uncut
highest surface of the cylinder.

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:18.320
To actually do a wax cylinder
scan, the wax cylinder is loaded

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.670
on a rod that's attached to
a rotating motor so the rod

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:23.720
and the cylinder can spin together.

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:27.120
And then the probe is mounted so
that it's pointing at the cylinder.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:30.130
And in the image on the
left, you can see the light

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:33.170
that the probe analyzes and shines.

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:34.470
And from that, you can tell

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:36.570
that we're only ever
imaging a very small section

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:38.850
of the cylinder at any one time.

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:41.560
And while the probe is pointed
at the cylinder, it is configured

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:45.490
to rapidly acquire measures, about
a thousand measures per second.

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:48.640
And while it's acquiring, we
spin the cylinder in front of it.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.160
And when you do that and plot
the results, you'll see something

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.460
like the animation on the right.

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:56.260
And what you're seeing is that
same pattern of peaks and valleys

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.510
that you saw on the previous
slide, but now there's one valley

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:02.510
that should be marked with a
red arrow that's oscillating up

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:05.260
and down as the cylinder rotates.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.430
And to read this, remember
that the stylus sits

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:09.340
in the groove while
the cylinder rotates.

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:12.490
So this oscillation means that
as the stylus sat in that portion

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:15.520
of the groove and the cylinder
rotated, the needle would oscillate

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.510 position:56%
up and down with that groove bottom,

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:21.440
so that vertical oscillation
is the audio content.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:24.420
After a full rotation, the
needle would have moved

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:29.780
over to the next groove
onto the right.

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.900
Another thing that you'll
notice is that the peaks

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:35.220
and valleys are falling
together down the frame.

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:38.040
And this animation only shows
about a quarter of a rotation,

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.960
but you can imagine that if
we kept rotating, the peaks

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:44.600
and valleys might at some point
dip out the bottom of the frame.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.190
And the reason for this is

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:50.040
that on the small scale
cylinders are not perfectly round,

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.650
there are ellipses and
there's also local lumps

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:54.500
or deformities in the wax.

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.200
And so, falling down the
screen means we're coming

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:00.040
down on the side on
one of those lumps.

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:04.190
The probe only has a finite
range that tends to be smaller

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:06.810
than the side of roundness,
so it's generally not possible

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:10.130 position:56%
to allow the probe to sit statically
and still keep the cylinder

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:12.660
in the view over the
entire rotation.

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:15.500
To correct for this, we use another
instrument to measure the height

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:19.220
of the cylinder ahead of where
the probe is measuring and we feed

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:22.540
that data to a motor that moves the
camera to chase after the surface

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:25.100
as it rises and falls,
and this keeps the surface

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:28.470
in range the entire time and
this is called focus control.

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:30.910
And the need for focus control
is the first of many ways

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:32.610
in which this process
has to be tuned

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:35.640
to the particularity of
individual cylinders.

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:38.960
When everything is
working correctly,

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:42.460
when focus control is enabled, we
rotate through one full rotation

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:45.360
of the cylinder, the cylinder
stays in range the whole time.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.910
And at the end of the rotation,
we're imaging the same point

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:49.900
that we were when we started.

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:52.850
And over the course of that
rotation, we've collected somewhere

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:55.330
between 20,000 and
60,000 measurements

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:59.020
of that 1.8 millimeter wide line.

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.590
If you save and display
the measures that you took

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:05.160
over that rotation next to each
other, we can create a topography

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.340
of the cylinder one ring at a time.

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:11.670
And what you're seeing on screen is
realtime acquisition for cylinder

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:14.390
with focus control and
with more active audio

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:18.190
and the corresponding topography
with several channels in it

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:21.400
that represent the groove that
the needle would have followed.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:24.610
To scan an entire cylinder,

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:27.050
what we do is we make one
full rotation then we step

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:32.570 position:56%
over to the portion that hasn't been
measured yet, and we rotate it again

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:36.480
and measure another ring, and then
step over and measure, step over

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.320
and measure and repeat all the way
down the length of the cylinder,

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:43.900
sweeping out these 1.8
millimeter-wide rings of images.

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:47.280 position:56%
The number of measures that we take
around each rotation of the cylinder

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.990
at this point dictates the
sampling rate of our final audio.

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:53.470
One revolution of the cylinder
contains as certain duration

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:57.620
of audio which is set by the
recording speed of the cylinder.

00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:59.890
So for example, if a
cylinder was recorded

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:03.510
at 120 rotations per minute,
each time the stylus rotated

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:06.430
around the cylinder it would
produce half a second of audio.

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:09.940
So if we collect 48,000
samples over one rotation,

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:13.250
then we've made 48,000 measures
over half a second of audio

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:15.180
which would translate to
an output sampling rate

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:18.160
of 96,000 samples per
second of audio.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:21.270
If need be, we can sample well
in excess of what is needed

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:25.430
to output audio at
96,000 samples per second,

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:30.070 position:56%
though this does increase the amount
of time it takes to do a scan.

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:33.590
Scanning an entire cylinder,
depending on the resolution,

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:35.850
takes between one and four hours.

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:38.510
But this process is automated,
so we can load up a cylinder,

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:42.180 position:56%
we can set up our scan, start it
and then walk away and come back one

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:46.340
to four hours later to a completed
surface map containing measurements

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:49.960
at the height at many, many points
over the surface of a cylinder.

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:53.110
And this is the machine
that we built to do this

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:56.070
for the Phoebe Hearst
Anthropology Museum project.

00:19:56.070 --> 00:20:01.750
You can see there is a long arm
and the cylinders rest along

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:04.130
that shaft supported
by plastic plugs

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:06.570
that rest inside the cylinders.

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:09.600
Previous versions of the scanning
machine only allow for loading

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.660 position:56%
and scanning one cylinder at a time.

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:13.980
But for this project, we
expanded and built a machine

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:17.440
with a longer-than-usual shaft for
holding cylinders which allows us

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.810
to load a total of three at a time.

00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:23.240
At one to three hours per cylinder,
this lets us run for typically

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:26.410
around nine hours without user
intervention or supervision,

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:29.270
which opens the possibility
of running scans overnight,

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:33.320 position:56%
and that was the main goal and point
of innovation for this project.

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.190
Our goal was to scan
the Hearst collection

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:38.880 position:56%
in a high-volume systematic way,
scanning three cylinders over night,

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.690
three during the day, scanning
almost constantly and pushing

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:45.820
out six maps of cylinders everyday.

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:49.520
The longer arm, the longer
shaft was a valuable change

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:52.800
but it proved quite
difficult to implement

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:55.190
because we're taking measurements
that are accurate on such

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:59.370
as small scale, vibrations,
deviations or imprecisions

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:03.170
and motions and in the physical
pieces that we work with

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:06.300
and built our machine with, add
imprecisions to the measurements

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:07.690
that we take, and those can show

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:11.070
up as audible effects
in the final audio.

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:13.540
The length of the shaft
exacerbates this problem.

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:16.300
Small vibrations at the bottom
of the shaft get amplified

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.580
and exaggerated over the length,

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:22.490
and the way that the shaft also
exaggerates during vibrations.

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:25.020
And ultimately, we had to try
several different configurations

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:27.450
over the course of the project.

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:30.550
In addition to reimagining how we
could physically build the system

00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:32.520
to accommodate many cylinders,

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:35.460
we also had to update
our software interface.

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:39.100
So this is the interface that's
used to control acquisition.

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:42.880
The surface level, it allows the
operator to adjust parameters

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:46.340
to control the scan, setting what
region of the cylinder to scan,

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:48.620
what resolution and so forth.

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:52.240
And for the method in general
but especially for this project

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:55.040
where we're working with
cylinders in the thousands produced

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.460
in different locations,
under different conditions,

00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:59.610
over a four-decade time span,

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:02.220
the scanning apparatus
must be adaptable.

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:04.880
The properties of cylinders
change slightly depending on when

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:08.530
and how they were made, and so the
scanning interface includes options

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:14.010
to let us optimize our data
taking for the cylinders at hand.

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:16.990
It also had to be updated for the
current project to be conducive

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:18.900
to a higher volume workflow.

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:21.900
At the beginning of the
project, I redesigned it.

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:25.710
I redesigned sections of
it to allow for scanning

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:28.760
at least three cylinders,
potentially each

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:31.990
at different parameters
without user input in-between.

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:35.660 position:56%
And I also incorporated changes to
tune it specifically to our project,

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:39.220
so that museum-specific metadata
is saved along with the results

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:42.750
of the scan and so that operators
have access to information

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:44.700
about the cylinders when
they're handling them,

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:48.610
loading them and setting up scans.

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:50.770
Under the surface, the
software is also ensuring

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:52.570
that our measurements
are taken carefully.

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:55.460
Again, we're making measurements
on a very small scale,

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:59.770 position:56%
and so just as external physical
vibrations can cause noise and data,

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:01.710
big jumps in the focus
motor or hiccups

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:04.840
in data flow can show small
changes in our measurements

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:07.780
that have big effects
in the final audio.

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:10.440
And our measurements have to
be ultimately carefully timed

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.660
so that the rate of acquisition
matches the rate of rotation

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:16.390
and so that-- and the focus
control has to be very incremental

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:18.720
and gradual and carefully done.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.520
And the last thing to
note about acquisition is

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:22.940
that during this project
we've been able

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:25.980
to make it work for
broken cylinders.

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:29.660
The only real physical demand on
media is that we need to be able

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:32.560
to maneuver them around
and shine light on them.

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:36.110
So the risk with delicate media
becomes that they might fall apart

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:37.890
on the mandrel, or
if they're unstable,

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:40.550
they might wobble while
we're measuring them.

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:44.550
And so if cylinders are cracked or
broken, we can use special fixtures

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:46.750
to keep them still
and keep them intact

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:49.720
and fully supported while
they're spinning around.

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:52.010
Cracked cylinders can
be held together

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:53.610
to prevent further splitting

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:56.970
with polyethylene bands
wrapped around the cylinder.

00:23:56.970 --> 00:24:00.360
Broken cylinders can be
reassembled like jigsaw puzzles

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:01.990
on a cylindrical form and held

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:06.370
in place using those same
polyethylene bands and in the areas

00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:09.810
that don't have audio on
them with sticky putty.

00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:12.960
Then both cracked and broken
cylinders can be scanned as usual,

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:15.530
we just scan up to the tape
then we move it into the portion

00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:17.310
that was already imaged
and we move over

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:19.410
and scan the rest of the cylinder.

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:23.620
And so when everything works
together correctly, the end result

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:27.090
of a full cylinder scan
are two groups of files.

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:30.630
We get metadata files that
describe the scanning process

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:34.510
that get achieved and then
we get our main output file.

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:38.330
And what that is, is it's usually
between one and two gigabytes

00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:41.050
and it's just an ordered
list of height values

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:43.580
at several million points
around the cylinder.

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:46.270
And we call this our surface map.

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:50.960
The question then becomes, what
do we do with it to make it useful

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.930
and to make sense of
it in a meaningful way?

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:57.540
And an obvious solution is
to visualize it in some way,

00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:00.140
but there are many
options, animations,

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:02.920
topographies, charts, et cetera.

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:06.020
But what we want out of
this data is very specific.

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:09.330
We care very specifically about
what's happening in the groove,

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:10.720
how its height is changing.

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:13.330
So we want to choose a method
of visualizing our data

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:15.150
in which the groove
bottom is clearly

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:16.910
and obviously distinguishable.

00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:21.400 position:56%
So the images that we produce and
work with are grayscale depth images

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:22.770
like the one on the right.

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:25.200
Moving vertically in the
image corresponds to moving

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.280
around the circumference
of the cylinder

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:29.850
which is the first
dimension, moving horizontally

00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:32.450
in the image corresponds to moving
down the length of the cylinder

00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:34.130
which is our second dimension,

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:38.030
and the color conveys the third
dimension which is the height.

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:41.870 position:56%
Blacker tones indicate a lower point
on the surface, and lighter tones,

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:45.150
closer to white, indicate
higher points on the surface.

00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:48.330
And so in this view, we're looking
at the cylinders if I cut a seam

00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:51.600
down the wall of the cylinder from
the bottom to top and then open it

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.360
up and flattened it
out on my screen.

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.820
And so again in this view, white
is higher and dark is lower.

00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:01.150
So the groove bottom
is now very obvious

00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:05.670
as these dark vertical
stripes down our screen.

00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:07.410
And when read in this convention,

00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:11.140
patterns in large data sets are
easily recognizable visually

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:15.460
to operators and computationally
to image-processing methods.

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:19.080
And just as important deviations
from those patterns which can come

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:23.140 position:56%
from errors in acquisition or
anomalies in a specific cylinder due

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:26.600
to the recording conditions
under which it was made,

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:29.520
these things become
clearly visible as well.

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:34.470
So to actually produce sound
from a completed surface map,

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:37.720
the data is loaded into a
piece of in-house software

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:41.340
that stitches the data together,
displays the depth image

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:43.900
that users can look
through in detail,

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:47.520
and what you're seeing
here is a screenshot

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.040
of the analysis software
that we use.

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:53.200
Parameters at the top
tune various algorithms

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.370
to the particular cylinder at hand.

00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:57.360
Again, making sure that
the process is suitable

00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:00.100
for a wide variety of cylinders.

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:03.300
The main image on the upper
portion of the window shows six

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:07.610
of those 1.8 millimeter wide bands
or rings which is six rotations

00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:11.560
around with the cylinder that are
all stacked up next to each other.

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:14.580
And the relevant data
is very clear to--

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:17.300
visually to operators but it needs

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:20.830
to be analytically isolated
by a computer program.

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:22.630
And because the data is so regular,

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:25.370
because we have this regular
consistent pattern of black stripes

00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:29.570
across the image, we can use a
combination of minimal finding

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:32.760
and pattern recognition algorithms
to go through the data set

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:36.640 position:56%
and identify the bottom of the
groove and mark it with a blue line.

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:39.440
And you can in the upper
black and white image

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:42.230
where the software has
gone through and done that.

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:43.530
And so we call this process

00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:46.750
of identifying flagging
the groove bottom tracking.

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:49.890
The right-hand side of the
image shows a zoomed in view

00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:52.680
of a small section of the
larger cylinder image.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:55.850
And if you follow along the bottom
of the groove which I've marked

00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:59.240
with a red line, you can see
the image oscillating from light

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.710
to dark, which in this
image corresponds

00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:03.920
to the groove height
oscillating up and down.

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:06.240
And again the vertical
change from high to low,

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:10.600
high to low is audio content.

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.420
The plot at the bottom middle
of the interface shows a point

00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:16.930
by point plot of the data
along the thick red line

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:20.080
which is really a point by
point reconstruction of the path

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:22.300
that a playback stylus
would have traced

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:24.820
out as it moves through the groove.

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:28.580
And this is also the data that
the tracking algorithm isolated

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:31.730
from the rest of the image by going
through and flagging the bottom

00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:34.110
of the groove with the blue line.

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:37.100
And so this path is very,
very close to being all

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:38.610
of the necessary information needed

00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:40.820
to reproduce the sound
on the recording.

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:44.870
The final step is to actually take
the derivative along that line

00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:49.210 position:56%
and calculate the speed of the
stylus because for these recordings,

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:52.190
due to the mechanics of
the recording device,

00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:54.840
the speed of the needle is
proportional to the pressure

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:58.090
of the sound waves, and so
the speed is what's identical

00:28:58.090 --> 00:29:00.510
to the sound signal that
we're trying to recover.

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:05.730 position:56%
And this analysis works for broken
cylinders too with the added benefit

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:07.670
of providing an image of the break

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:09.700
so that we can tell
how severe it is.

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:12.610
In the best case scenario, if the
break is small and the grooves line

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:13.910
up on either side of the division,

00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:16.450
we can process the
cylinder normally.

00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:19.640
The only complication becomes
if the split is too large

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:22.060
or if pieces aren't
lined up correctly.

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:27.340
Sometimes the tracking algorithm
can't find the path of the stylus,

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:30.390
it gets lost across the
boundaries between pieces,

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:32.750
and the program needs
user intervention

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:36.200
to trace along the
bottom of the groove.

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:39.550
And so, we can still work
with these broken cylinders

00:29:39.550 --> 00:29:44.260
where the data doesn't quite line
up, it just ends up being labor

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:47.230
and time intensive for the user.

00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:51.490
So I have here a sample of a
recording from the collection

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:55.400
that we digitized during
this project, it records Ishi

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:59.110
who was the last surviving member
of a group called the Yahi.

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:02.270
He encountered a UC
anthropologist who did a series

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:06.270
around 200 recordings with him all
in the Hearst Museum collection.

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:09.420
And this clip is a short
excerpt, it's 20 seconds,

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:12.040
but a full recording would
typically be around two

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:14.520
and half minutes at most.

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:16.990
And first, you're going
to hear a voice in English

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:19.690
and that's Alfred Kroeber who
would have conducted the recording

00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:22.070
session, and then he'll
introduce the recording

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:24.670
and then you'll hear Ishi singing.

00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:26.460
And then also on screen,
you'll be able

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:28.940 position:56%
to see the cursor retracing the path

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:38.860
that the original stylus
would have taken.

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:41.470
&gt;&gt; Alfred Kroeber: [Background
Noise] April 14, 1940.

00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:43.510
Ishi, justice song,
repetition of 1714.

00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:56.340
[ Noise and Singing ]

00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:58.740
&gt;&gt; Olivia Dill: So there
is a few things to notice.

00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:02.340
The first is these
clicking and pooping noises,

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:06.300
and those are results of dust
or dirt on top of the cylinder

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:08.730
of small scratches
digging into the cylinder.

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:10.290
And each time the stylus
encounters it,

00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:12.940
it pops up and creates that sound.

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:14.990
And then also towards the end,

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:18.350
there's this more regular
rhythmic crunching noise,

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:22.140
and that's the result of the needle
encountering patches of mold decay,

00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:26.250
places where mold has
eaten away part of the wax.

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:28.830
And it turns out that because
we're working with images

00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:31.060
and because we can look at
the surface in such detail,

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:32.360
we're actually in a position

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:35.610
to minimize the audible
effects of those defects.

00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:38.710
We can isolate them from the
intentionally recorded audio.

00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:43.070
Looking at the left, most
image you'll see raw data

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:46.050
and there's a big white
smear across the bottom.

00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:47.350
And because white is high,

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:49.130
again that represents
something that's sitting

00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:50.430
on top of the cylinder.

00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:53.430
So that's probably a hair
or some other type of fiber.

00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:57.550
And if you look at the point at the
plot underneath the leftmost image,

00:31:57.550 --> 00:32:01.130
you can see that there's
this slowly undulating curve,

00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:02.710
and that's the path that
the needle would have taken.

00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:07.310
And then towards the end, there's
a sudden very large jump in height

00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:11.360 position:56%
and that's the boundary of the hair.

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:13.850
And that sudden jump in height,
as the stylus went over it,

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:15.720
it would cause the stylus to pop up

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:18.450
and that would introduce very
high frequency audio in the form

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:20.710
of those pops and clicks
that you're hearing.

00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:24.060
And so what we do is we use an
edge-finding algorithm to go

00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:27.840
through the images and flag changes
that are too steep to be audio

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:30.740
as the boundaries blemishes
or blobs.

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:33.410
And in the middle view,
you can see all the defects

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:36.130
that the algorithm found
encircled in orange.

00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:40.890 position:56%
And on the rightmost image, you can
see where the algorithm has smoothed

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:44.160
between the found boundaries and
clean the defects from the image

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:46.460 position:56%
to lessen their impact on the audio.

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:49.760
So I'm going to play you a
smaller section from the audio

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:52.370
that you've just heard and
then I'll play it again for you

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:53.750
without cleaning, just the raw data

00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:55.800
and then I'll play
you the clean version

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.830
so that you have a
point of comparison.

00:32:57.830 --> 00:33:00.510
So here's the raw data.

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:06.790
[ Singing ]

00:33:06.790 --> 00:33:10.510
And then here it is with
the cleaning applied.

00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:18.470
[ Singing ]

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:20.390
So, some improvement.

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:23.790
Another thing to notice is this
high frequency hissing noise

00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:28.270
in the background of the audio, and
that's actually a signature product

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:30.570
of the method that we're using.

00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:33.800
Because we're digitalizing with
light, which is far smaller

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:36.750
than a traditional playback
stylus, we see the surface

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:40.180
in far greater resolution
than a needle would have.

00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:43.820
The spot size of the probe is
several microns whereas a stylus

00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:46.060 position:56%
would be a few hundred microns wide.

00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:47.360
And this difference in scale,

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:51.550 position:56%
that's the optical scans resolve far
smaller and closer together changes

00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:53.680
in the surface height
which correspond

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:57.870
to much higher frequency noises
than a stylus can register.

00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:59.490
So, in the diagram at the top,

00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:02.920
you're seeing the different colored
waving lines that represent signals

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.540
at different frequencies
and wavelengths.

00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:07.990
And the line at the top
would have large wavelengths

00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:10.910
and to low frequencies and
the frequency increases

00:34:10.910 --> 00:34:12.700
as you step down in those lines.

00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:16.240
The stylus can only physically
conform to the largest wavelengths

00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:19.210
where the spot of the probe
has no problem resolving

00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:22.580
and measuring very high frequency
signals all the way down.

00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:26.710
And so this means that the optical
method produces flat transfers.

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:29.200
We digitize higher frequency audio.

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:33.090 position:56%
We can resolve and-- And as a result
of the resolution that we have,

00:34:33.090 --> 00:34:36.410
we can resolve and identify and
clean out those sudden changes

00:34:36.410 --> 00:34:40.000
in height caused by damage as I
just showed you, but it also means

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.630
that we digitize higher
frequency noise.

00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:46.770 position:56%
A lot of that content occurs outside
the audible range of hearing,

00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:49.910
but some of that is the
high frequency hiss present

00:34:49.910 --> 00:34:53.800
in the raw audio from our system.

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:58.240
And it's a trivial matter to filter
out any extra high-frequency noise

00:34:58.240 --> 00:34:59.730
with commercial audio software.

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:02.020
And for the current
version of our project,

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:05.880 position:56%
we provide a filtered version that's
a little easier to listen to with

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:08.440
that extra high-frequency
noise filtered out in addition

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:13.300
to the raw version for all the
cylinders in the collection.

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:18.240
And so at the end of analysis with
our software, we get a two-minute

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:22.280
or so long digital audio file,
and the way that we got there was

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:25.090
by chasing relevant information
through these different formats.

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:28.100
There was some initial sound
wave and then we traced

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:31.610
that into the height of the-- to
the height of the cylinder surface,

00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:33.780
and then into these black
and white depth images,

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:36.480
and finally into this
digital audio file.

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:39.520
From a physicist's perspective,

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:42.470
we started out with some
original real-world signal,

00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:46.260 position:56%
and we recovered it and we digitized
it, and that's sort of the boundary

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:49.100
of what the physics
toolkit is equipped to do.

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:51.830
But there's still this final area
of information that gets left

00:35:51.830 --> 00:35:55.690
out of this equation,
which is the information

00:35:55.690 --> 00:35:59.430
that really motivated all of
this effort in the first place,

00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:02.040
and that's the cultural and
linguistic information derived

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:05.490
by analysis from linguists
and from community members.

00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:07.640
And so the last piece of
this process, the last piece

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:11.420
of the puzzle is to turn over
the audio file to those people.

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:13.980
For the Hearst Museum project,
our final audio is handled

00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:17.860
by the California Language Archive
which is an online repository

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:20.280
of indigenous language materials.

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:23.570
They will facilitate
restricted access to the content

00:36:23.570 --> 00:36:25.460
of the Hearst Museum cylinders.

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:30.620
So, as the technology stands now,
we're capable of doing quite a lot.

00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:35.400
We can create carefully-acquired
high-resolution surface maps

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:37.540
accurate on the micron scale.

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:41.980
We can analyze those maps to
extract audio, we can clean them

00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:45.190
to minimize the audible
effect of decay and damage,

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:47.740
and we can create primary
digitized--

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:51.230
primary digital files to be
circulated and meta to be--

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:53.760
metadata to be archived
which ensures

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:56.250 position:56%
that the maps will make sense to
those looking at them in the future,

00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:59.840
and will allow those
maps to be reanalyzed

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:02.760
as new processing algorithms
become available.

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:05.970
And as of this current project,
we can do this in large volumes

00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:08.420
for media in various
states of stability.

00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:11.130
But, I'd like to mention some
questions that we can ask

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:13.910
about the future direction of the
technology now that we're working

00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:17.150
on a larger scale allowed
by the new project.

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:19.510
One of the lessons that start to--

00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:22.940
that started to emerge out of this
project is potential different ways

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:26.040
that we could be working
with broken cylinders.

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.400
Currently, the strategy
is to reassemble them

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.620
and analyze them as
if they were whole.

00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:33.030
At the top, you're seeing
a cylinder that was broken

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:35.230
into five large pieces
that we reassembled

00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:38.320
on the cylindrical
form and then scanned.

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:41.880
And for the most part, this jigsaw
puzzle strategy works fairly well.

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:46.480
But as I said earlier,
if we're inaccurate,

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:51.670
and for us inaccurate means not
precise on the micron scale,

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:54.360
which is highly probable,
if we're inaccurate

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:57.820
when we reassemble the cylinders,
then the groove might not line

00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:00.450
up across the transition
between pieces.

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:03.200
The tracking algorithm
has a tendency to jump

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:05.680
to a different portion of
the groove after the break,

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:08.910
connecting two pieces of
the cylinder that aren't--

00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:10.220
that weren't meant to be connected.

00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:12.620
So then when we play it back,

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:15.460
the broken cylinders were
modeling the motion of the stylus

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:18.340
as if it's jumping around
the cylinder and the audio

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:20.780
that we produced is jumbled
and in the wrong order.

00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:24.730
This problem has been studied
in the past for broken disks,

00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:28.470 position:56%
but now we have an opportunity to
look at examples of broken cylinders

00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:30.480
and potentially make
improvements to our method.

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:36.990
There are a few different
strategies we could take.

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:40.420
We could continue scanning the
cylinders the way that we do now

00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:43.100
and introduce new tracking
algorithms

00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:47.220
to better track the broken
pieces or to rearrange the data

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:50.530
after it's been taken, and
that would use capabilities

00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:53.830
that we already have in
our software in a way.

00:38:53.830 --> 00:38:56.760
Or another solution
that's very appealing

00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:59.570
to us though more computationally
intensive is

00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:01.980
to take a step backwards
and address the problem

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:03.840
from the acquisition stage.

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:07.000
If we scan the cylinder in pieces,
which would take the creation

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.270
of a new fixture to hold
fragments in place under the probe,

00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:13.170
then we could get several
images of fragments,

00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:16.050
and those images would have
very well-defined borders.

00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:20.550
And then we could transport the
jigsaw puzzle assembly problem

00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:24.360 position:56%
that we do physically with the
cylinders now into the digital space

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:27.120 position:56%
and reassemble the pieces digitally.

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:29.980
With a new more sophisticated
user interface,

00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:32.840
we could either allow the
user to move the pieces around

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:34.830
and assemble them themselves,

00:39:34.830 --> 00:39:37.660
or in a more complex
data analysis solution,

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:40.860
we could analyze the images
of fragments, define the edges

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:44.110
and process the geometry
of the edges to suggest

00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:46.560
and align likely matches.

00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:48.640
If we do this correctly
enough and if pieces get lined

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:50.280
up precisely enough,
then we wouldn't have

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:52.100
to change our tracking algorithm,

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:54.540
the existing algorithm
should work properly.

00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:57.010
And, also the amount of handling

00:39:57.010 --> 00:40:03.260
of artifacts would be
decreased in this case.

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:05.650
And in the case where
the matching is carried

00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:08.080
out computationally
rather than by a user,

00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:10.690
we would have a more robust way
of working with media in many,

00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:12.660
many pieces, which
is actually something

00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:15.500
that we're not currently
equipped to digitize.

00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:19.010 position:56%
This issue of increasing our ability
to handle broken cylinders is one

00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:21.610 position:56%
that we're eager to explore as a lot

00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:24.470
of the intrigue behind the
collection and many of the requests

00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:27.340
that we've gotten are for broken
cylinders as those are the ones

00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:30.010
that the most people
have not heard yet.

00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:34.240
And also these broken cylinders are
the most time intensive cylinders

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:35.540
that we work with.

00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:38.590
Under the current method, a broken
cylinder can take as much as twice

00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:41.930
as long as an intact
cylinder to scan and triple

00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:44.980 position:56%
if not quadruple as long to process.

00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:47.210
Something else that we've
learned and continue to learn

00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:49.740
about is duplicate cylinders.

00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:51.710
When we started the
project we learned

00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:53.740
that then anthropology
museum collection contains

00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:58.310 position:56%
around 300 cylinders, so that's less
than 10% of the total collection

00:40:58.310 --> 00:41:01.150
that have been duplicated
in some way.

00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:05.730 position:56%
Some cylinders have anywhere between
one and three separate duplicates

00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:08.170
that are labeled physically
by engravings around the top

00:41:08.170 --> 00:41:10.340
of the cylinder and
in museum metadata

00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:12.820
as being duplicates in some way.

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:17.200
Physically, cylinder duplicates are
often very similar but they appear

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:19.250
to be made out of different
kinds of wax

00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:21.680
with different surface
textures both visibly

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:23.880
and on the microscopic scale.

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:26.540
We've also seen several of
these duplicate cylinders

00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:30.550
with a chalky finish that we don't
typically see in the originals.

00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:33.800
And we've had to learn how to
process and scan these effectively

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:37.200
as they're often more
difficult to work with.

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:39.420
So we're collecting data
and we're learning more

00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:40.810
about the physical differences

00:41:40.810 --> 00:41:43.510
between original cylinders
and their duplicates.

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:45.840
And what we are not sure

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:48.910
of is exactly how those
duplicates were made.

00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:50.940
There are several potential
processes,

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:54.330
the first being the creation of
a mold of the original cylinder

00:41:54.330 --> 00:41:58.270
and then using that mold to
cast or print off duplicates,

00:41:58.270 --> 00:42:01.260
and some duplicates that we've
seen are certainly very similar

00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:02.560
to their originals.

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:05.850
In cases where there are multiple
duplicates we've seen duplicates

00:42:05.850 --> 00:42:09.350
that have identical features
on the microscopic scale,

00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:12.740
which does suggest some sort of
printing from a cast or mold.

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:14.040
But the process that we're aware

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:17.160
of for creating duplicates using
casts destroys the originals

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:19.940
which ask the question how we
can have supposed duplicates

00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:23.410
and originals paired together.

00:42:23.410 --> 00:42:26.340
Also, not all duplicates
are visually similar.

00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:30.620 position:56%
Some duplicate original pairs differ
drastically in the microscopic view.

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:33.430
With the amplitude of audio
oscillation, groove width

00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:35.240
and groove depth changing
drastically

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:38.450
between the two artifacts,
oftentimes the audio

00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:40.900
on cylinder will sound
audibly faster than the audio

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:44.100
on another cylinder even when
played back at the same speed.

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:47.390
This would suggest that either a
method of acoustic transfer perhaps

00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:50.430
by playing a cylinder--
playing an original cylinder

00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:53.220 position:56%
and directing the audio from the
horn on one phonograph into the horn

00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:56.820
on another or a pantographic
method, driving the stylus

00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:59.750
on one recording device
with a stylus on another.

00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:02.280
And so as it stands now,
we're still in the process

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:06.420
of gathering visual evidence as we
scan more duplicate original sets.

00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:09.480 position:56%
But potentially this data could
direct us to a meaningful conclusion

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:13.840
about the provenance of
these duplicated cylinders.

00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:16.230
Something else that we've
observed while collecting

00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:19.120
and processing data are
interesting anomalies.

00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:22.400
The vast majority of cylinder
data looks very, very similar.

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:27.240
For an entire cylinder, typically
you just see vertical stripes--

00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:29.920
vertical black stripes that
are all about the same width

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:31.770
and same distance apart
within a cylinder

00:43:31.770 --> 00:43:35.260
and typically also the same depth
throughout the entire cylinder.

00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:39.170
But this consistency within
and between data sets means

00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:42.140
that when there are breaks on this
regularity, they really stand out.

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:44.790
And so as we go through the
collection, we see many instances

00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:46.770
of irregular groove patterns.

00:43:46.770 --> 00:43:48.290
We've seen several cylinders

00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:50.400
where the stylus is
wandering unconstrained

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:53.780
across the surface potentially
resulting from a defect

00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:56.420
in the lead screw mechanism
on recording devices

00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:58.800
that controls the position of
the needle along the length

00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:01.720
of the cylinder as it spins.

00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:03.850
We've also seen repeating patterns

00:44:03.850 --> 00:44:06.400
as if the cylinder
was recorded twice

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:09.010
or as if there was
some other malfunction

00:44:09.010 --> 00:44:11.560
in the recording apparatus
or stylus.

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:14.690
And part of the development of
this project has been learning how

00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:18.230
to effectively process and
work through these anomalies

00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:19.530
which can be difficult

00:44:19.530 --> 00:44:21.890
as our automatic groove
finding algorithm works best

00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:25.270
for regular consistent patterns.

00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:28.670 position:56%
Sometimes, we've had the opportunity
to correct these anomalies.

00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:31.440
In the case of this cylinder
where there are two sets

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:34.240
of groove patterns on top
of each other, I went in

00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:38.370 position:56%
and I manually told the software
first to follow one pattern and then

00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:40.090
to follow the second pattern.

00:44:40.090 --> 00:44:42.660
And I produced two separate
audio files resulting

00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:45.910
from the two separate cylinder
paths, and then listen back

00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:49.150
and chose for the final product
the audio that made sense

00:44:49.150 --> 00:44:52.410
and wasn't jumbled
in the wrong order.

00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:56.710
We also see and note a
typical surface textures

00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:59.240
and interesting patterns of decay.

00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:02.420
There are certain shapes
that we're used to seeing.

00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:07.300 position:56%
Mold decay, cracks, divots from
fingernails and scratches are common

00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:12.320
and have very distinct shapes and
identifiable visual signatures.

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:15.010
But we've also come across some
new shapes and morphologies

00:45:15.010 --> 00:45:16.760
that we haven't seen before.

00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:19.960 position:56%
Some of these are evidence of damage

00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:22.180
for which the cause
is still unknown.

00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:26.760
And others are causes
that we now understand.

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:31.150
For example, through discussion
with our project conservator,

00:45:31.150 --> 00:45:34.870
we found that the decay pattern
on the bottom right occurred

00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:37.530
in regions first on
a cylinder that had--

00:45:37.530 --> 00:45:40.540
at one point had adhesive tape
wrapped around the cylinder

00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:44.680
and then removed, and so that's
the result of that process.

00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:48.140
And so now, we know the visual
signature of this process

00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:50.360
and we are able to recognize
it in other cylinders

00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:52.430
that we've scanned since.

00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:54.270
Another pattern that
we've seen recurring

00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:57.640
through the collection is a high
frequency very small vertical

00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:01.180
oscillation at much higher
frequencies than audio occurs,

00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:05.700 position:56%
and at much higher frequencies than
are registered by a playback stylus.

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:07.700
And so in the plot on the bottom,

00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:11.460
you're seeing that vertical
oscillation as hair or fuzz sort

00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:14.030
of on top of that very
slow angulating curve

00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:17.130
that the stylus would have
traced to produce audio.

00:46:17.130 --> 00:46:22.690
We suspect that this high-frequency
oscillation is an effect

00:46:22.690 --> 00:46:25.880
from the cutter vibrating
or chattering very rapidly

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:29.460
against the cylinder's
surface as the cylinder is cut.

00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:31.190
And we further suspect
that the frequency

00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:34.060
at which this chatter
occurs should be dictated

00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:37.540
by the resonant frequency specific
to the dimensions of the stylus

00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:40.010
and the mechanics of
the recording device.

00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:42.480
If this is true it should be
possible to use the frequency

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:48.170
of this shudder as measured on the
cylinder as a reference tone to use

00:46:48.170 --> 00:46:50.960
to predict the recording
speed of the cylinder.

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:53.990
And this would be useful as
we've seen several cylinders

00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:56.280
with either no documented
playback speed

00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:59.870
or with an incorrect
documented playback speed.

00:46:59.870 --> 00:47:03.750
So I'm looking through these
last few examples of things

00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:07.530
that we've learned and hoped to
learn by analyzing the images.

00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:10.050
The impact of our project
has the potential

00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:14.200 position:56%
to go beyond creating our repository
of sought-after culturally

00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:17.100
and academically significant audio.

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:20.180
The method, as I've described
today, is very targeted.

00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:23.660
We collect our images and we
extract specifically the position

00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:27.490
of the groove bottom and both
the path of the playback stylus

00:47:27.490 --> 00:47:30.070
and the position of
defects that affect it,

00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:33.260
and we use those things
specifically to produce sound.

00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:36.470
But what this overview
or what this imagining

00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:41.610
of the process overlooks is that we
collect incredibly detailed images

00:47:41.610 --> 00:47:45.260
of the entire surface
of these cylinders.

00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:48.190
And so as a result of that,
we are able to observe things

00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:49.770
like what I've just mentioned.

00:47:49.770 --> 00:47:52.640
Anomalies in the groove pattern,
the evidence of malfunctions

00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:56.650
in the machinery, the microscopic
state of these materials,

00:47:56.650 --> 00:47:59.950
interesting dynamic interactions
between the recording stylus

00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:02.830
and the wax surface, and
many other curiosities

00:48:02.830 --> 00:48:07.400
that aren't evident playing these
recordings back with the stylus.

00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:10.230
Even just observing these
curiosities and following

00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:13.300
up on anomalies as they come up
while they're processing the images

00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:18.410
with the goal of producing
sound has given us information

00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:20.880
and we have learned more
about our collection.

00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:24.000
As of this current project,

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.690
we are collecting these
images in the hundreds.

00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:27.990
And by the end of the project,

00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:30.310
we'll have a repository
of thousands of them.

00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:33.750
And so it's exciting and
enticing to imagine what kinds

00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:36.420
of questions can be
asked and answered

00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:40.670 position:56%
through even more careful analytics
study of a database of these images,

00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:41.970
a database with more entries

00:48:41.970 --> 00:48:44.710
than we've been able
to accumulate before.

00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:48.970
Those with a data analysis toolkit
would be very well-positioned

00:48:48.970 --> 00:48:52.430
to answer compelling questions
across many disciplines

00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:55.990
by analyzing these images in
just as targeted ways as we have

00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:58.520
but with different targets in mind.

00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:02.090
And we hope that there's more
to learn for those with interest

00:49:02.090 --> 00:49:03.670
in a wide variety of fields,

00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:07.010
information about our collection's
history, about the processes

00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:10.030
of recording cylinders and
about the practicalities

00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:12.760
of preserving the materials.

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:17.090
So to close, I'd like to say
thank you to the many institutions

00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:19.470
and people who have
given funding and support

00:49:19.470 --> 00:49:22.090
to the optical scanning
technology in the decade

00:49:22.090 --> 00:49:24.790
since its creation and
before this project.

00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:27.130
And finally, I'd like
to point out that

00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:30.020
over 40 students have
contributed to the development

00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:34.380
of the optical scanning technology
outside of the current project

00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:36.510
since its initial publication.

00:49:36.510 --> 00:49:40.100
Undergraduates on campus work with
the technology every semester.

00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:41.890
We're in the process of
training an undergraduate

00:49:41.890 --> 00:49:43.580
to work in our lab right now.

00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:46.780
And students from the University of
Applied Sciences developed portions

00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:51.220
of the acquisition and analysis
software as parts of month longs--

00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:54.040
months long master's
thesis every summer.

00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:56.910
And so-- And also I myself
started working with the technology

00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:58.440
when I was still a student.

00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:00.640
So we hope that there's
opportunities for students

00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:03.670
at the undergraduate and at
the graduate level in addition

00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:05.400
to scholars to engage
with the questions

00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:08.650
that I've proposed here and beyond.

00:50:08.650 --> 00:50:10.430 position:56%
So thank you very much for your time

00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:12.200
and for your attention
and for having me here.

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:14.810
If you're still curious
there are some links here.

00:50:14.810 --> 00:50:18.510
And if you have any questions,
I'll do my best to answer.

00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:25.810
[ Applause ]

00:50:25.810 --> 00:50:27.160
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: Do we
have any questions for Oliva,

00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:31.810
and we'll repeat those
questions for our remote viewers.

00:50:31.810 --> 00:50:36.150
&gt;&gt; You mentioned that the
servers have data on the speed

00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:40.200
on which they're recorded,
how often do you find that,

00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:43.270 position:56%
do you see much variation-- i.e. the
original recording [inaudible] was

00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:44.570
spring loaded?

00:50:44.570 --> 00:50:48.820
Do you see variations or like decay

00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:53.230
in the [inaudible]
speed in the cylinder?

00:50:53.230 --> 00:50:56.630
&gt;&gt; Olivia Dill: So the question
was about the accuracy of the RP--

00:50:56.630 --> 00:51:00.000
of the speed data that we have and
any variations that we've seen.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:03.390
So there's two kind
of pieces to that.

00:51:03.390 --> 00:51:07.610
We get our data from-- there was
a massive survey of the collection

00:51:07.610 --> 00:51:12.040 position:56%
that was done a while ago by Richard
Keeling and he wrote up a catalogue

00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:14.550
that has all of the
RPMs listed in it.

00:51:14.550 --> 00:51:19.640
And so far, we found three out
of 500-some cylinders for which

00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:22.980
that speed, when we played them
back, it was obviously wrong.

00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:26.380
So sometimes they are inaccurate.

00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:29.560
And then the other
thing is that sometimes

00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:33.330
within the individual
cylinder there will be sections

00:51:33.330 --> 00:51:36.550
where you can audibly hear
the cylinder coming up to

00:51:36.550 --> 00:51:39.130
that recording speed, so it will--

00:51:39.130 --> 00:51:42.630
it makes it like zipper
sound as it comes from a high

00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:44.150
to low frequency and levels out.

00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:49.500
So, there is some variation within
the individual cylinder about that.

00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:51.990
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:56.050
Yeah. There were a few
where there were many,

00:51:56.050 --> 00:51:57.900
many of those speed changes,

00:51:57.900 --> 00:52:01.850
but again that's like,
maybe five in 500.

00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:17.150
&gt;&gt; Did I understand correctly?

00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:36.870
Probably didn't which
is why I am asking.

00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:40.110
Was your digital image
output actually more accurate

00:52:40.110 --> 00:52:41.410
than the original recording?

00:52:41.410 --> 00:52:47.220
And if so could that be
corrected with something later

00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:51.590
down the road once all
of these are scanned

00:52:51.590 --> 00:52:54.120
with some type of 3D
printing device?

00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:58.640
&gt;&gt; Olivia Dill: So the question
was if our method is more accurate

00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:03.160
than the actual playback
of the cylinder and if

00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:06.190
that could be corrected
with 3D printing.

00:53:06.190 --> 00:53:08.600
It's less a matter of accurate and
more a matter of-- I think you're--

00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:13.450
are you referring to the frequency
domain that I talked about?

00:53:13.450 --> 00:53:14.750
It's--

00:53:14.750 --> 00:53:16.920
&gt;&gt; If that makes sense,
that's what I'm referring to.

00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:21.570
&gt;&gt; Olivia Dill: So it
just ends up being that--

00:53:21.570 --> 00:53:26.170 position:56%
a playback stylus can only play back
up to a certain frequency of audio.

00:53:26.170 --> 00:53:30.060
And then after that frequency,
if there is anything there,

00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:31.890
it gets attenuated
and the volume drops.

00:53:31.890 --> 00:53:36.260
And that happens typically
around like 4000 hertz.

00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:41.880
And the recording capabilities
of the devices

00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:48.950
in the first place only
went up to about 5000 hertz.

00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:55.250
So there's that 1000 hertz sweet
spot where we're catching audio

00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:06.310
that can't be played
back with a stylus.

00:54:06.310 --> 00:54:18.800
So in that regard, we are
getting more information

00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:23.600
than you can have by
playing them back.

00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:28.910
But in terms of if we are
creating information that's not

00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:35.300
in the cylinder, I-- my tendency
is to say that that's not the case.

00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:36.760
Yeah, I hope that helps.

00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:38.710
&gt;&gt; I have a two-part question.

00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:43.960
How does this technology compare to
other kinds of technology that work

00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:46.510
with cylinders to reproduce
sounds, and will you be--

00:54:46.510 --> 00:54:49.680
is this technology can
be taken on the road,

00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:51.310
what's the adaptability
and scalability?

00:54:51.310 --> 00:54:52.610
&gt;&gt; Olivia Dill: OK.

00:54:52.610 --> 00:54:56.540
So the question was about how our
method compares to existing methods

00:54:56.540 --> 00:55:00.650
of transfer and if ours
is scalable and movable.

00:55:00.650 --> 00:55:02.370
So there are-- the other
I think common method

00:55:02.370 --> 00:55:04.430
of digitizing these
things is the archeophone.

00:55:04.430 --> 00:55:09.060
And so again, there is that
1000 or so hertz bandwidth

00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:15.250
of frequency range that we can
recover that that device cannot.

00:55:15.250 --> 00:55:23.310
It just ends up being a question
of whether or not there's anything

00:55:23.310 --> 00:55:24.610
that you want to recover.

00:55:24.610 --> 00:55:28.240
But the information
from our system up above

00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:31.790
in that high-frequency range,

00:55:31.790 --> 00:55:35.360
even if it's not recovering
vocal content,

00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:39.610
it is recovering the content that
allows us to do our blob cleaning

00:55:39.610 --> 00:55:41.900
and to see these high-frequency
effects.

00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:46.230 position:56%
So, that's kind of where our system
differs from those existing systems.

00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:51.250
And as far as transportability,
it's-- I mean once we built it,

00:55:51.250 --> 00:55:54.310
it's pretty much-- we could
take it apart and rebuild it

00:55:54.310 --> 00:55:56.920
and move it, it would be difficult.

00:55:56.920 --> 00:56:05.070
There's also a little bit of
particularity in where we place it.

00:56:05.070 --> 00:56:09.640
Currently, I work in a basement
and we like that because, again,

00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:11.720
vibrations leach into system.

00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:14.720
And so if you're up on the
sixth floor of a building--

00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:34.310
we do have another version of
this that's up on the sixth floor

00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:39.700
of a building-- and the
building itself wobbles,

00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:42.560
and so that's something
that they have to account

00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:45.480
for in their measurements.

00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:51.110
So, there's that factor
about where you put it.

00:56:51.110 --> 00:56:56.860
It is difficult and it does require
precision to build and to maintain,

00:56:56.860 --> 00:57:00.000
so there's that sort of
skill set investment as well.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.580
But in scalability,
I think this is--

00:57:02.580 --> 00:57:07.210
that's kind of what we're trying
to figure out in this process is

00:57:07.210 --> 00:57:11.370
if we can scale it to make it
larger and make it more applicable

00:57:11.370 --> 00:57:12.860
for production and
systematic scanning.

00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:14.160
Does that help?

00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:15.690
&gt;&gt; I'm just curious how
you do the image stitching

00:57:15.690 --> 00:57:18.060
with the different
[inaudible] section

00:57:18.060 --> 00:57:20.020
and like how much overlap you have
to have between two adjacent spots

00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:21.320
to get like an accurate
idea of how to [inaudible].

00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:22.620
&gt;&gt; Olivia Dill: Yeah, so--
that's actually interesting.

00:57:22.620 --> 00:57:23.920
The question was about stitching

00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:25.220
and how we compile--
separate scans, correct?

00:57:25.220 --> 00:57:26.520
So, it typically takes about four
millimeters of overlap is my cutoff

00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:27.820
between the first and
the second image.

00:57:27.820 --> 00:57:29.120
And the interesting thing
is we don't actually do

00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:30.420
that stitching together
visually with the image,

00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:31.720
we produce two separate audio files

00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:33.020
and then we use commercial
audio processing software

00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:34.320
to find the identical point
between those audio files

00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:35.620
and then we basically just cut
and paste and stick them together.

00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:36.920 position:56%
And it's kind of a comfort that they
usually end up being identical even

00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:38.220
if the scan is done
a little bit later.

00:57:38.220 --> 00:57:39.520
There is at some point in the audio

00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:40.820
from both sections that's visibly
identical at the waveform level.

00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:42.160 position:56%
&gt;&gt; What's maximum length of time in
realtime is taken each one cylinder?

00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:43.460
&gt;&gt; Olivia Dill: So the
maximum length of time--

00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:44.770
[ Inaudible Discussion ]

00:57:44.770 --> 00:57:46.070
Oh that's true.

00:57:46.070 --> 00:57:48.510
&gt;&gt; Make it both--

00:57:48.510 --> 00:57:53.270
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:56.760
&gt;&gt; Olivia Dill: I think, maximum
I've seen is about six hours

00:57:56.760 --> 00:58:00.690
and that was a very high resolution
and very high exposure time,

00:58:00.690 --> 00:58:03.860
but that's way beyond
sort of the threshold

00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:06.370
and I've seen broken cylinders

00:58:06.370 --> 00:58:12.230 position:56%
that the scanning process took
maybe an hour but the actual process

00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:14.820
of me trying to physically
manipulate it and get it

00:58:14.820 --> 00:58:19.490
to stay still while it was
being measured took eight hours.

00:58:19.490 --> 00:58:22.760
But that's probably my
fault not the software's.

00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:33.410
&gt;&gt; More from an aesthetic
standpoint,

00:58:34.430 --> 00:58:41.060
since this was before the time

00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:44.130
when recording engineers
was really even a thing.

00:58:44.130 --> 00:58:48.440
Do you find a lot of variability in
the quality of the recordings or,

00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:49.770
like, you know, the audibility?

00:58:49.770 --> 00:58:53.160
&gt;&gt; Olivia Dill: So the
question was about variability

00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:54.700
and differences in quality.

00:58:54.700 --> 00:58:56.000
It does vary a lot.

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:59.810
A big factor is how well the
cylinder has been preserved,

00:58:59.810 --> 00:59:01.110
the cylinder that's had a lot

00:59:01.110 --> 00:59:03.670
of mold damage sounds
are very, very bad.

00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:08.210
So that's kind of the biggest
most immediate factor for me

00:59:08.210 --> 00:59:09.990
as somebody listening back.

00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:12.230
But in terms of what
was originally there,

00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:15.480
there is a lot of variability.

00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:18.570
Something that we see a lot is,

00:59:18.570 --> 00:59:24.980
if the audio that's being
recorded is too loud then we see--

00:59:24.980 --> 00:59:27.910
the stylus needs to
trace out a very steep

00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:32.450
and very tall vertical oscillation,
and sometimes the height

00:59:32.450 --> 00:59:36.220
of that oscillation is higher
than the surface of the cylinder,

00:59:36.220 --> 00:59:38.630
so you see that the needle pops
out the top of the cylinder

00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:41.660
to every upswing and then
comes back down sometime later

00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:43.010
and that's called clipping.

00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:49.380
And so that's a big, very clearly
ineffective how the cylinder was

00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:51.350
recorded, how close the
person was to the horn,

00:59:51.350 --> 00:59:54.670
how loud they were speaking
and if they've been instructed

00:59:54.670 --> 00:59:57.450
to record properly,
so we see that a lot.

00:59:57.450 --> 01:00:01.870
And that's the biggest thing I
have noticed, is just volume,

01:00:01.870 --> 01:00:04.040
how clear they're speaking.

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:07.140
If the stylus-- Again, sometimes
you see these recording anomalies

01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:10.400
where it's clear but something
was off in the recording.

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:14.450
Something was broken or somebody
wasn't handling it carefully,

01:00:14.450 --> 01:00:18.310
so that will affect your output.

01:00:18.310 --> 01:00:20.160
Yeah, that's about all I've seen.

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:48.140 position:56%
&gt;&gt; For those who may be new to
this, I mean including myself, but--

01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:56.370
who may have access to a large
collection of wax cylinders

01:00:56.370 --> 01:01:01.720
and they really don't know how to
prioritize which ones to submit

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:04.360
to an organization such
as yourself, you know,

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:05.660
once we get more [inaudible].

01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:10.510
Can you give any clues like,
OK look for the yellow ones--

01:01:10.510 --> 01:01:13.980
they're going to degrade
faster, any clues like that?

01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:16.900
&gt;&gt; Olivia Dill: The question
was about prioritizing

01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:18.610
which cylinders we digitize.

01:01:18.610 --> 01:01:23.350
I don't know from a
preservation standpoint

01:01:23.350 --> 01:01:27.280
if there are certain types of
cylinders that are more vulnerable

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:29.160
to decay than other ones.

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:31.240
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: We will
be having a talk on some

01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:36.320
of the work we've been looking
at with different cylinders

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:41.960 position:56%
in the nearish future and we'll be
sharing some of our latest research.

01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:43.850
So, look for this in the
next two or three months.

01:01:43.850 --> 01:01:45.150
&gt;&gt; Olivia Dill: Yeah,
the one thing I can say

01:01:45.150 --> 01:01:46.450
from our project perspective is
our priority list so far has come

01:01:46.450 --> 01:01:47.990
from the community, from the
cylinders that are the most sought

01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:49.760
after from patrons that want to
hear things and also from our own--

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:51.500
we have-- one of the PIs is a
linguist who studies these material

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:53.510
and so from his linguistic
and academic priorities.

01:01:53.510 --> 01:02:02.630
[ Inaudible Remark ]

01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:08.090
So there were some-- There were
two that we were able to very,

01:02:08.090 --> 01:02:13.170
very slightly improve
by cleaning them.

01:02:13.170 --> 01:02:20.220
But, even in those cases, it
looked-- the scans that resulted,

01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:26.110
the surface was just so uneven and
so noisy that we couldn't even--

01:02:26.110 --> 01:02:28.560
there were two that we just
couldn't find grooves on.

01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:31.520
And so it was some-- we
think it was some property

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:34.760
of the surface that
it was just uneven.

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:39.010
I'm not-- Yeah, we haven't
figured that out yet.

01:02:39.010 --> 01:02:40.970
[ Inaudible Remark ]

01:02:40.970 --> 01:02:43.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah, one more because that
someone asked if you expand

01:02:43.630 --> 01:02:47.320
on the frequency limit of styli,
because there are sound systems

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:50.470
that are capable of
reproducing beyond 4000 hertz,

01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:55.720
so is there a stylus
contractor for that sweet spot?

01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:58.710 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Olivia Dill: Yeah, I'm not sure--

01:02:58.710 --> 01:03:01.030
I know there are stylus
that can go higher

01:03:01.030 --> 01:03:05.410
but the tradeoff there I believe is

01:03:05.410 --> 01:03:08.050
that those stylus have
a smaller surface area

01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:11.200
and so they apply more pressure
to the surface of the cylinder

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:14.350
which is, from a preservation
standard,

01:03:14.350 --> 01:03:20.570
not desirable because that's
more degradation on the surface.

01:03:20.570 --> 01:03:27.910
So, yes it is possible to go higher
than that sort of 4000 cutoff,

01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:31.010
but again, at the risk of
damaging your cylinder surface.

01:03:31.010 --> 01:03:36.920
And we did do some studies over
the summer to see exactly what

01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:43.140
that tradeoff is but we have
yet to really assess that out.

01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:46.290
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: Just
one quick question.

01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:49.480
&gt;&gt; You said that there are
some direct transfers that take

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:56.370
from earlier days, how does this
compare to sounds [inaudible]?

01:03:56.370 --> 01:03:58.820
&gt;&gt; Olivia Dill: Yeah, the question
was about comparing our results

01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:01.700
to tape transfers,
and we have compared

01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:03.710
and there are a couple different
things that are going on,

01:04:03.710 --> 01:04:07.220
there are some effects that happen
from the EQ that was applied

01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:09.690 position:56%
by the people doing those transfers,

01:04:09.690 --> 01:04:14.530
and they have some
high-frequency artifact and a very,

01:04:14.530 --> 01:04:17.690
very loud low frequency
noise envelope.

01:04:17.690 --> 01:04:20.960
So it just-- it sounds like
there's this big booming furnace

01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:24.250
in the background and we
don't have that in our audio.

01:04:24.250 --> 01:04:29.460
But in the audible
range, it's very similar.

01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:36.670 position:56%
It just ends up being that ours have
the click and the cleaning effect,

01:04:36.670 --> 01:04:39.800
so ours are cleaner, they have
less clicks, and in the cases

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:41.890
of mold damage that
makes a big different.

01:04:41.890 --> 01:04:44.700
And then ours is a flat transfer
so there's no overall EQ,

01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:48.710
there's no amplifying
low frequencies

01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:51.510
or attenuating high frequencies.

01:04:51.510 --> 01:05:00.160
[ Inaudible Remark ]

01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:01.960
&gt;&gt; Olivia Dill: I do
not know the method

01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:05.510
for direct transfer I just know
that it was from a hard stylus.

01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:21.970
[ Inaudible Discussion ]

01:05:21.970 --> 01:05:24.250
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: So, I think
what's really fascinating is--

01:05:24.250 --> 01:05:27.750
and one thing we've been
talking about with [inaudible] is

01:05:27.750 --> 01:05:30.630
that the amount of data we
can keep to actually analyze

01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:32.940
from scholar's perspective
as you are starting

01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:35.600
to say is really quite
stunning and this sort of trends

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:37.680
that we're finding once
you get this huge database

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:40.360
which I think is really
exciting for the future.

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:45.940
We'll be here for just a few more
moments before Olivia has to rush

01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:49.200

join me in thanking her again
