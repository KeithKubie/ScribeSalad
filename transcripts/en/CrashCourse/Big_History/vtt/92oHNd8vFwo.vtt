00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
Hi, I'm John Green. Welcome to
Crash Course Big History.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.860
Today we're gonna be traversing the evolutionary
epic - the great story of magnificent beasts,

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:14.300
terrifying predators, quite a lot of extinctions,
and countless varieties of evolutionary forms.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:19.820
It's the ultimate epic - millions upon millions
of species playing out a drama that has so

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:27.140
far lasted 3.8 billion years, with 99% of
the actors having already left the stage forever.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.900
And you thought finding employment in this job market
was tough - you've already won the lottery my friend!

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:40.820
[Theme Music]

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.160
The keystone of our story is evolution by
natural selection. So, in the 1830's a young

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.640
Charles Darwin traveled around the world on
the HMS Beagle - inarguably, by the way, the

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.510
most important beagle of all time - I apologize
Snoopy, but it's true.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.829
Darwin had the rare and amazing opportunity
to study a great variety of the world's wildlife,

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.600
and upon returning to England he discovered that a
variety of finches he had collected on the Galapagos

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.900
Islands had beaks that were subtly adapted to their
different environments and food sources.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.160
Darwin later combined this idea with the observation
of how populations tend to over-breed and

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.710
strain their resources - I mean if there's
competition for resources in an environment,

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.140
then animals with useful traits would survive
and pass those traits on to their offspring.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.340
Those who didn't survive long enough to reproduce
would have their traits wiped out from the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.040
evolutionary tree - natural selection.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.140
We've talked some on Crash Course Big History
about good science, and Darwin was a good scientist.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.620
He worked on his ideas for two decades,
systematically finding new evidence to support his case

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:51.780
And then finally in 1859 he published "On the Origin of Species" and it sent shock waves around the world.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.740
The book offered an explanation for why so
many species that seemed perfectly adapted

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.149
to their environment could have been formed
by a blind but elegant law of nature. Darwin's

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:07.809
theory was so elegant yet so effective that
his colleague Thomas Huxley exclaimed "How

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:12.599
extremely stupid not to have thought of that!"
Side note: if you ever read "On the Origin

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.930
of Species" try to get a first edition, because
in later editions Darwin made a bunch of revisions

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.290
in answer to some critics, but he got it actually
more right the first time.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.840
Speaking of which, one of the phrases only
included in the later editions and commonly

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.790
attributed to Darwin was "survival of the
fittest" but that phrase was actually coined

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.269
by Herbert Spencer, father of the more troubling
Social Darwinism which tried to apply nature's

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.069
rather harsh laws to human social orders.

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.099
I prefer Darwin's original phrase, "natural
selection". Everything from cuckoo birds that

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.319
lay their eggs in the nests of other birds to
giraffes whose long necks are good for reaching

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:53.500
food in high trees, to humans, whose brains make
up for their fragile bodies, are selected for, naturally.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.560
An even better phrase though, would be "non-random
selection" or maybe even "non-random elimination."

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.620
While all genetic mutations are generated
by a random copying error, or random variation

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:08.750
completely beyond the animal's control, the
selection of those traits is not random. Successful

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.519
variations that allow you to survive and reproduce
are determined by the very specific circumstances

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.379
of your environment, where elimination (death)
might not be far away.

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:24.120
So, the selection of your traits is done by
a very specific, and sometimes brutal, list

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.390
of criteria. This is why people who say that
they don't understand how all animals could

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.250
have "evolved by chance" don't really understand
how evolution works.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.080
Here's another phrase that doesn't get it
right: "evolution is just a theory." In everyday

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.549
speech, theory means guess. But in science,
a theory is something that was tested time

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:48.329
and time again, explains many different observations,
and is backed up by a mountain of evidence.

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:54.540
Evolution is a theory, like gravity is a theory...
And you don't go jumping out your window because

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:58.989
gravity is "just a theory." Why are we so
certain? Emily knows.

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:04.140
Evolution is one of the most tested, most
utilized, and widely-accepted theories in science.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.940
It's backed up by literal tons of fossil
evidence, which can show us shared

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.120
traits with species that no longer exist, and help us map
out lines of descent for creatures around today.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.600
DNA sequencing further tells us about lines
of descent, and you can measure the commonality

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:21.730
of the DNA possessed by two animals to tell
how closely related they are and when they

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.690
may have split off from a common ancestor.

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.110
Radiometric dating allows us to assign dates to various
fossils, further helping us map out lines of descent.

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.900
Then there's the simple fact that extinct
species are always found in the same rock

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.290
layers you'd expect to find them, which is
why you don't see a bunny skeleton in Cambrian

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:42.960
rock layers from half a billion years ago. That's
also how we know that Dimetrodon is not a dinosaur.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.280
Closely related species are often geographically
distributed near one another. That's not to

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.820
mention that we can see evolution happening
before our very eyes - whether it be the discovery

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.920
of a new species that recently moved into
a different environment, the development of

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:01.200
newly adapted bacteria into super bugs, the
evolution of new breeds of rapidly reproducing

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:07.120
insects, or the almost constant changes in gene
distribution in animal populations all over the world.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.880
So, remember the prokaryotes and the eukaryotes?
Gradually, some single cell eukaryotes began

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.380
to work together in a thing called symbiosis,
where one cell did something in exchange for

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:21.040
another cell doing something else, thus aiding
the survival of both. Some eukaryotes became

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.740
so co-operative and even interwoven that one
cell could not possibly live without the other.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.760
Symbiosis was particularly handy in times
of disaster. Around 650 million years ago,

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:36.570
the earth was completely frozen over. Snowball
earth was not a great place for life. Many

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.780
underwater bacteria survived under the ice
and oceans, photosynthesizers may have have

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.470
survived in small hot spots where there was
liquid water... In such constrained conditions

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.500
it's likely that individual cells started
to work together more and more.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:55.560
Now is where we start to blaze through the
evolutionary epic of complex multi-cellular life.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.880
Between the start of complex multicellular life
and today, there have been 5 mass extinction events.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.700
In nature, species compete in niches,
it's also called niches depending on where

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.330
you're from, but I call them niches! It's
an area of the environment that requires a

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.920
special set of skills and traits to extract
food and reproduce. When niches are full,

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.930
competition is heavy, traits become finely-tuned
and evolution generally slows down a little.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:23.180
But! When a disastrous extinction event wipes
out the majority of the animals living in

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:28.230
a niche, the surviving species have room and
a lack of competitors to evolve new traits

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:33.940
very fast to fill the niche again in what
we call an adaptive radiation. The evolutionary

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:39.380
epic is dotted with periods of niches filling
up, being swept clean by disaster and filling

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.470
again by new rapidly-evolving species.

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.890
Example: for the longest time, dinosaurs ruled
the earth and mammals were a puny, timid race

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:51.200
of small shrew-like creatures that stayed
out of their way. Sometimes we burrowed in

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:56.300
the ground or only came out at night, or confined
our diet to tiny bugs. We could not compete

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.020
with dinosaurs in their niches. Then, the
dinosaurs were wiped out and mammals were

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:06.640
able to rapidly fill all the empty niches, creating
apes and elephants and horses and even whales.

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:11.730
So after snowball earth, the Ediacaran era
gives us the first extensive fossil evidence

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:16.430
for multicellular organisms. There were various
ancient forms that resemble today's worms,

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:21.550
corals, molluscs, various underwater plants.
But then in the Cambrian era, adaptive radiation

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:26.520
really got under way and multicellular life
filled thousands upon thousands of niches

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:31.660
unlocked by their new traits. A lot more is
just possible for multicelled organisms than

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.740
for single-celled ones. Like, not to brag
or to bring up my astonishing strength again,

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.480
but I can bench much more than a eukaryote!

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.500
Some of the most famous creatures the got
their start in the Cambrian were trilobites,

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:47.580
these bug-like creatures with exoskeletons
that existed in a variety of species and forms,

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:53.060
occasionally in swarms of thousands. And they
didn't go extinct for nearly 300 million years

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:56.840
- that's over a thousand times longer than
Homo-sapiens have been on the planet.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:01.640
Also, as my four-year-old son can tell you,
the Cambrian era had predators like Anomalocaris,

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:07.360
which reached sizes of nearly a meter long,
with razor-sharp teeth and grasping limbs.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:13.020
By the time of the Ordovician period, photosynthesizers
were making their first tentative steps out

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:19.080
of the sea into a new niche - the land. Plants
colonized coastlines first, and then gradually,

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:23.850
over millions and millions of years moved
further and further inland. In the oceans,

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:29.080
life continued to be abundant, with fish and
sharks multiplying into a variety of forms.

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:34.260
And there were all kinds of crazy life-forms, like
underwater scorpions that were 2½ meters long!

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:39.860
I mean, for the first 100 million years of
complex evolution, a mind-boggling diversity

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:43.960
of creatures was emerging. But that also meant
all the niches on the planet were getting

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:49.150
very full, and many competitors in the same
niche made it difficult for a new species

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:54.450
to enter it with ease! And then came extinction!
I feel like extinction's gonna be a thing,

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.930
Stan. Is there any way we can make a thing
for extinction?

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:58.000
Yes!

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.630
Ordovician Earth went through first a major
freezing period, killing off many warm-water

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:07.550
species, and then a radical heating period,
killing off many cold-water species. Many

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:11.980
ecological niches were swept clean, and this
removal of competition meant that new species

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:16.360
could enter empty niches and evolve rapidly
in one of those adaptive radiations. There

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:20.160
was also incentive to move out of the seas
and on to the land.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.980
In the Silurian period, one of those groups
that evolved rapidly by filling terrestrial

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:29.130
niches, was the arthropods, those exoskeleton
species, and the ancestors of many of today's

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:32.960
bugs. Since plants continued to colonize the
land and more and more of the Earth's surface

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:36.960
was becoming forested, that increase in the
number of photosynthesizers increased the

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:42.980
percentage of oxygen in the atmosphere, to between
30 and 35%. Today, it's approximately 21%.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.140
Arthropods came out of the sea, started filling
niches on land, and their metabolism took

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:52.760
advantage of this all-you-can-respire oxygen
buffet, growing to enormous sizes like a dragonfly

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:58.110
with a meter-long wing span or a scorpion
1.8 meters long. Again with the scorpions!

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:02.460
In the early Devonian period, the forests
of the earth were composed of mosses, ferns,

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:07.370
and short shrubs. Some plants eventually evolved
a woody covering which provided some back

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:11.830
support and allowed them to grow taller and
taller and compete with others in their niche

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:14.760
by grasping higher and higher for sunlight.
In the first episode,

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.400
we did promise to explain the existence of trees.
Bingo!

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:22.460
Also, by the Devonian, our vertebrate ancestors
had arrived on land. Unlike Arthropods, vertebrate

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:27.680
skeletons are on the inside and our skin is
more porous, making it easier for water to

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.650
escape. This limited our ability to fill land-based
niches at first, we were amphibious. From

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:38.380
this amphibious ancestor, all tetrapods gained their
characteristic skeletal structure: Four limbs, five digits.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:40.840
And then once again, extinction.

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:45.520
Scientists debate about what caused the Devonian
extinction, but once again, a couple of sharp

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:51.340
rises and disappearances from the fossil record
shows that the niches were being swept clean.

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:56.210
Again, the number of species on the earth
drastically declined. But only temporarily.

00:10:56.210 --> 00:11:00.560
The carboniferous intensified the forestation
of the planet even more. Meanwhile, amphibians

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:04.990
were filling up coastal niches with competition.
So to escape into new niches, some evolved

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:09.740
less porous skin to venture further inland
without drying out, and they also laid eggs

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:14.220
with a protective shell, meaning that they didn't
have to return to water to hatch their young.

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:17.800
These were reptiles. They were able to
fill up the inland world, where real estate

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.640
was cheap. And come to think of it, real estate
still is cheap.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:25.840
Next up was the Permian. Many of the forests
dried out, creating deserts. Reptiles thrived

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:30.120
in this transformed environment with less
competition from the forest and river dwellers.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:35.020
Also during this time, the ancestor of mammals
evolved. I'm talking of course, about the

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:39.140
synapsids. So considering that they were the
ancestors of everything from you to your dog

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:43.770
to elephants and whales, it gives you an idea
of how radically things can change in just

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:48.790
250 million years of evolution. Because then,
once again, at the end of the Permian era,

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:54.420
we have extinction. Often referred to as the
Great Dying. It was the single largest extinction

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:58.960
event in the past half billion years. Its
cause is still debated, but the most dominant

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:04.410
theory is an environmental disaster caused
by volcanoes in Siberia. All told, over 90%

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:10.810
of marine life and 70% of terrestrial life
- maybe more - died out. Synapsids were hard

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:15.270
hit, leaving space for a huge adaptive radiation
of giant reptiles.

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:20.390
Now we are finally closing in on my son Henry's
favorite period of history: The giant reptile

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:24.860
period. In the subsequent Triassic period,
the earth's climate was ludicrously dry with

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:29.630
many deserts, and then near the north and
south poles, it was warm and wet. Again, dry

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:34.029
climates were a big win for reptiles and our
mammalian ancestors got a bit of the short

00:12:34.029 --> 00:12:39.360
end of the stick because there was so much reptilian
competition in many niches, so we hid on the fringes.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:43.920
Meanwhile, there were many kinds of giant
reptiles in the Triassic of which the dinosaurs

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:49.470
were just one kind until, extinction. The
Triassic extinction, possibly due to volcanic

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:54.660
super-eruptions or an asteroid impact emptied
a lot of niches of competition and allowed

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:59.040
one particular group of giant reptiles, the
dinosaurs, to reign supreme.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:03.560
And that, finally, led to those periods that
are what most people think of when they hear

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:09.220
the word paleontology or the word fossil:
The Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:13.240
I'll spare you the snarky commentary about
how the T-Rex in Jurassic Park actually lived

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:19.490
in the Cretaceous. Dinosaurs were the dominant
animals on this planet for a whopping 135

00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:25.260
million years. That's 540 times longer than
our species has even existed. To help you

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:29.980
understand this, consider two of the most
iconic dinosaurs: Stegosaurus and T-Rex.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:33.910
Stegosaurus was around in the late Jurassic,
T-Rex was around in the late Cretaceous. They

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:40.950
are separated by roughly 88 million years.
Humans and T-Rex are separated by less time

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:47.080
than T-Rex and stegosaurus. Approximately 65
million years ago, the reign of the dinosaurs ends,

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:52.120
you guessed it, in extinction. A rock roughly
10 kilometers across crashed into the present

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:57.640
day Yucatan Peninsula with a million times more force
than all the nuclear arsenals of the world combined.

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:02.900
Bad for the dinosaurs, but it opened up a
lot of niches previously occupied by them.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:07.700
Many small mammals were able to survive by
burrowing or simply requiring less food.

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:13.200
They were then in a position for another adaptive
radiation. Small mammals quickly evolved into an

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:20.260
immense variety of larger forms. And so was the story
of complex life on earth during the evolutionary epoch.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:24.640
Next week we will explore the nascent beginnings
of a new phase of complexity: the accumulation

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:29.810
of more knowledge, generation after generation.
And the intensification of a newfangled evolutionary

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:32.360
invention: Culture. See ya next time.
