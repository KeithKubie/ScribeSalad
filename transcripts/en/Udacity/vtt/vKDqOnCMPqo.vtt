00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.590
Here's an actual pedigree tracking bipolar disorder in an

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.680
Amish family. Now at first glance, you may think that

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.300
this looks pretty familiar, and may make you feel right

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.240
at home. But like many complex traits, this pedigree looks

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.060
different than it would for a single-gene disorder. For

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.790
example, if I told you to look at this pedigree

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.850
and tell me if you thought the inheritance pattern was

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.240
dominant or recessive. You might be inclined to say dominant,

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.360
if you look at the fact that the

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.600
trait doesn't skip generations and affected parents do give

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.580
rise to affected children. But you might also think

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.690
that it's recessive. For example over here the trait

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.605
skipped generations. And it did over here as well.

00:00:40.605 --> 00:00:43.800
And we have unaffected parents with affected children. That's

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.900
typical of a recessive trait. We're actually somewhere in

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.380
between. This is complex. Now to me, this pedigree

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.610
indicates a more dominant inheritance pattern. Now if we

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.180
assume the trait to be dominate like we learned

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.850
about in lesson five and completely penetrant right, that's

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.560
the only kind we've talked about up to this

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.050
point. Then we would expect affected children to have

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.850
at least one affected parent. But that's not what

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.540
we saw. What we see are unaffected parents. If

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.430
you thought the trait looks more recessive, we wouldn't expect

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.360
it to show up in every generation like it did here. These little

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.420
deviations from our normal inheritance patterns

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.280
are a key indicator that there are

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.110
likely multiple genetic factors, as well

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.150
as environmental factors, controlling the phenotype. Whenever

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.100
we find incompletely penetrant traits or

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.220
alleles, this is likely what's going on.
