00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.670
Hey,
what's going on?
It's built burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:08.260
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.
And Ah,

3
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.510
I'm checking in on you.
I'm just checking in on you.
How's,
ah,

4
00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.350
oh Jesus.
Who knows what to how anything is I,
um,

5
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.540
I flew today,
so I'm,
whenever I fly,
I'm a little bit scatterbrained,
you know,

6
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.940
I left 7:10 AM flight,
so I'd get up at like five 15,
you know,

7
00:00:28.941 --> 00:00:31.100
the shows didn't end till like 1130 or whatever.

8
00:00:31.101 --> 00:00:32.570
Couldn't get to sleep till like two.

9
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.880
So my goal I got to do is just make sure I don't miss the alarm clock,
get up,

10
00:00:37.881 --> 00:00:41.810
get to the airport,
stumbled through security and then not miss when they,

11
00:00:41.811 --> 00:00:46.630
you know,
board the flight,
which I did.
So I get there and that's it,
you know,

12
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.590
at myself,
a little parfait,
you know,
at that guy's fucking restaurant.

13
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.370
He's on the chew,
the guy with the shaved head,

14
00:00:55.371 --> 00:01:00.170
I went to his place and uh,
whatever.

15
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.370
I just got the Granola with the,
uh,
with the yogurt and some blueberries or some,

16
00:01:04.371 --> 00:01:05.690
something like that.
Vaguely remember.

17
00:01:05.691 --> 00:01:09.680
So I get on the plane and all I want to do is just go to sleep.
All right.

18
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.520
So I'd go to go to sleep and all of a sudden his fucking guy,

19
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.320
we'd get up to cruising altitude and this guy,
you know,
stands up wide awake,

20
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.010
like I sorta got six foot four dad jeans,

21
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.460
you know any of these awful shoes,

22
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.550
the shoes that you'd wear with a suit and you could tell he didn't want to pack

23
00:01:28.551 --> 00:01:30.030
like a pair of like leisure shoes.

24
00:01:30.031 --> 00:01:32.810
So he just wore those with this fucking awful dad jeans.

25
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.800
And he is just talking loud as shit.
Like one aisle up,
like yeah,

26
00:01:38.801 --> 00:01:40.370
I dunno where he walked up from,

27
00:01:40.371 --> 00:01:43.220
but he was a couple rows back and he came up and just talking to guy,
gone

28
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.430
<v 2>figure that we had to the hotel around 10 30.</v>

29
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.490
That way you get the burying all set up and after that we can maybe

30
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.750
<v 1>try to decide what we're going to do with the game plan is for after lunch,</v>

31
00:01:52.751 --> 00:01:55.120
you know?
Then I hear the other guy that goes,

32
00:01:55.121 --> 00:01:58.300
I just as I can understand what he's saying and the guy's like,
oh ha ha.

33
00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.100
And I just wanted to like fucking,
yeah,
God,

34
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.020
his fucking shoes with the two buckles on them.
Two buckles really?

35
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.170
Like how crazy are you feet that you got to strap him into that level so you

36
00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:12.820
don't have to,
they have a mind of their own.
So he finally walks back.
He goes,

37
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.300
yeah,
I want wanted to fuck you when he left.
So I finally knocked off and um,

38
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.740
I'm like sleeping deeply and all of a sudden I just feel this pressure on my

39
00:02:23.801 --> 00:02:26.240
left arm
and,

40
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.930
and I feel somebody shaking me and I wake up and it's the stewardess.

41
00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.490
She's class both my arms.
Nope,

42
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.910
my arm was both her hands like she's going to tell us that,
you know,

43
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.350
she getting the crash position something and I just look up at her.

44
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:43.870
I can't hear what the fuck she say.

45
00:02:43.871 --> 00:02:46.990
And then I realized that my headphones on so I just take the headphones off.

46
00:02:46.991 --> 00:02:49.600
I was like,
what?
What,
what's,
what's the matter?
She goes,

47
00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.310
does she want breakfast today?

48
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.070
I mean,
yeah,
some point now when I'm sleeping,
I didn't think they did that.

49
00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:06.490
I thought you only time they did.
That was when,
you know,

50
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.130
if there was like an emergency,
like I'm sorry,
I know you're sleeping,

51
00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:11.560
but you gotta bring your seat back up.
Cause God knows,
you know,

52
00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:16.330
that's so fucking crucial to the level of injury you're going to have at 37,000

53
00:03:16.331 --> 00:03:19.150
feet.
Right.
I know it's kind of hacky material,
but that's what you think.
Right.

54
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.690
She woke me up to see if I want a breakfast.
And I was just saying,

55
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.550
I hope I wasn't an asshole.
I was like,
no,

56
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.860
I got to get a hat that says I had a fucking parfait.

57
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.140
Just let this old man sleep.
So,
um,

58
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.780
I dunno,
I just,
and I couldn't get back to sleep.
So I started watching,
uh,

59
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.370
this season of the ultimate fighter and,
uh,

60
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.340
I don't,
I mean I know I've seen most of the seasons.

61
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.230
I forgot about this guy who was this guy.
Oh,
the fuck was his name.

62
00:03:53.231 --> 00:03:54.550
I can't remember.
But he just,

63
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.030
he was like in line to win the thing and he got completely hammered,

64
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.730
kicked out the windows on a limo,
you know,
he just went crazy and uh,

65
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.740
he got kicked off the show and completely,

66
00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:10.060
I guess blue is shot at being an in the UFC,
so,

67
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.420
but he didn't quit.
He just kept fighting.
He's had like 45 cents.

68
00:04:13.421 --> 00:04:15.790
And so they've got this big build up,

69
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.910
sort of the redemption house this year where it's people that you know,

70
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.520
were in it before and maybe didn't win.
I think that that's what it was.

71
00:04:21.521 --> 00:04:25.240
Like I said,
I was half asleep,
so I was watching his,
um,

72
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.970
I was watching his whole pre fight versus the French dude who,
uh,
you know,

73
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.320
was good with the kicks and shit and I'm watching this stuff and what's weird is

74
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.220
to cut into the guy,
you know,

75
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.240
who got kicked off the show and one of his ears is sticking out so much further

76
00:04:42.911 --> 00:04:46.840
than the other one.
Like,
and what kills me is the early part of the training.

77
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.750
It isn't,
so something happened to them during training.
Like what,

78
00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.710
what the fuck happens to those guys ears.

79
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.310
I understand like all like the uh,
the fluid in them and stuff.

80
00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.450
But this thing was just like,
I mean I can't,

81
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.480
it was like Mickey mouse ear.
Yeah.
Like one of those

82
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.820
sticking out straight out.
Like it was signaling to make a left.

83
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.940
And the other one,
you know,
sticks out a little bit,
but not that far.

84
00:05:12.941 --> 00:05:16.870
And they never addressed like what happened?
He said some cool one point.
He said,

85
00:05:16.871 --> 00:05:18.730
yeah,
you know,
he goes,
I've been around the world.

86
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.640
I got the scars to prove it and I'm going to go in there and I'm just going to

87
00:05:21.641 --> 00:05:23.890
beat this guy down.
And that's exactly what he did.

88
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.000
And I was one of the few times I was excited that the Mike the gate wasn't ready

89
00:05:28.001 --> 00:05:30.670
when we landed.
That's always the big jerk off.

90
00:05:30.671 --> 00:05:33.550
You know when you get in early to the airport,
congratulations.

91
00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.290
We're in 15 minutes early.

92
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.950
Unfortunately I gate is not available.

93
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.980
Of course it isn't because they weren't anticipating as being there and then

94
00:05:41.981 --> 00:05:44.230
there's no place to go.
You know,

95
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.470
they should have like a little fucking ice cream thing down at the end of the

96
00:05:47.471 --> 00:05:51.340
runway.
You know,
you peel off onto a little taxiway,
you know,

97
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.010
we just gets a little fucking Sunday or some shit.
We just basically,

98
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.980
the guy said these going to,
they're going to bring us to a,
uh,

99
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.430
I believe he said desolate part of the airport.

100
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.180
I know lax well enough at this point.
What they did,
they just,

101
00:06:08.181 --> 00:06:12.620
we just did a lap around the whole thing.
We landed on the,
uh,

102
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.510
what did I ever the fuck it is the south side of the fucking airport.

103
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.100
And we just landed cause that's a side United design,
which by the way,

104
00:06:22.101 --> 00:06:25.280
I'd like to apologize to the guy who got dragged off that fucking flight.

105
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.590
The fact that I ever flew that airline again,

106
00:06:27.591 --> 00:06:29.870
I already had my ticket and I wasn't even paying attention.

107
00:06:29.871 --> 00:06:34.130
I felt like such a fucking,
you know,
to fellow American,

108
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.860
they dragged off and even,
you know what,
even if he wasn't from here,

109
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:38.300
cause I don't know where the fuck he was from.

110
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.870
I think they assume it's going to chain or some shit.
Just human being,

111
00:06:41.871 --> 00:06:46.760
the human being,
you know.
Um,
I just felt dirty riding on that fucking airline.

112
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.830
Uh,
so that,
that's,
I think that's it with those guys,
you know,

113
00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.440
and when somebody else does something worse than,

114
00:06:54.441 --> 00:06:56.750
than we actually all realize that United was actually,
oh,
you know,

115
00:06:56.751 --> 00:07:00.230
they were actually kind of reserve let me smashed his cheekbone off the side of

116
00:07:00.231 --> 00:07:03.710
the,
I just can't believe they can make you get leave.
Like,
no,
I'm not leaving.

117
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:08.090
I'm not leaving.
Is the president getting on board,
then I'm not leaving.

118
00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:13.820
Plus nowadays the president has his own fucking plane
to just kill me.
It's like,

119
00:07:13.821 --> 00:07:16.790
what about that guy?
What about his plans?
What about his business?

120
00:07:16.791 --> 00:07:18.860
What about his loved ones?
What about all of that shit?

121
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:25.570
Just fucking dragging the guy off as he's screaming.
That was one of the,
I dunno,

122
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.010
that was just,
it was just really a,

123
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:29.443
<v 0>yeah.</v>

124
00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.170
<v 1>You know what kills me is,
you know,</v>

125
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.410
God damn well the head people at United Airlines,

126
00:07:34.411 --> 00:07:38.280
when they looked at that footage,
all they thought about was just damage control.

127
00:07:38.281 --> 00:07:42.600
They didn't give a fuck about that guy.
I Dunno.

128
00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.860
Am I out of my mind?
That should not have happened in a first world country.

129
00:07:46.861 --> 00:07:51.180
That was just like some,
uh,
overthrow the government.

130
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.680
There's no rules anymore.

131
00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:54.680
<v 0>Okay.</v>

132
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:59.600
<v 1>Jesus Christ.
I mean,
they just fucking manhandled that guy.
Like he did something.</v>

133
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.490
You know what he did?
He paid for a seat.
That's what he did.

134
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:07.730
And he got on and he put his stuff in the overhead compartment.

135
00:08:07.731 --> 00:08:09.500
He sat down like he was supposed to.

136
00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:13.310
Then he got his fucking ass kicked or he got roughed up.

137
00:08:13.311 --> 00:08:16.070
That'd be more than unites two minutes for roughing.
That's what you would get,

138
00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:19.990
you know.
So,
um,
anyway,

139
00:08:19.991 --> 00:08:23.780
so I get back to the fucking lax,
I'm still a little groggy or whatever.
And uh,

140
00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.950
I always take taxis,
you know,
cause nobody takes taxes out here,

141
00:08:27.951 --> 00:08:31.670
so they're always available.
You just walk right out.
And the guys there and a,

142
00:08:31.671 --> 00:08:33.590
I got a pet peeve on my luggage,
right?

143
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:35.930
Like whenever you walk up with the luggage,
you know,

144
00:08:35.931 --> 00:08:37.340
if the driver goes to take it,

145
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:40.970
what they do is they push the button to make the handle go down about three

146
00:08:40.971 --> 00:08:43.460
quarters of the way and then then they just release it and then they,

147
00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.660
and they just slammed the thing down.
So I always go,
just wait a second,

148
00:08:47.661 --> 00:08:50.610
wait a second,
I'm let me just do it.
And the guy just kept grabbing for it.

149
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:54.590
I said,
wait a second,
guys looking at me,
go thinking I'm the Dick.

150
00:08:54.591 --> 00:08:56.130
It's like I'm not a dick.
All right.

151
00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:00.990
So once you fucking mess up the handling,
once you mess up the fucking handle,

152
00:09:00.991 --> 00:09:04.080
now what am I going to do?
Carry it like it's the 1970s.

153
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:09.450
I travel like a stores.
So we get the whole thing down.

154
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:14.550
He gets in the car,
goes,
how was your flight?
I say it was great.
And he goes,

155
00:09:14.551 --> 00:09:16.890
where are you going to tell him the address?
And he goes,
okay,
can you,

156
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:18.990
can you fucking type it into my phone?

157
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:21.690
<v 0>Okay.</v>

158
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:25.590
<v 1>I Dunno.
Am I an asshole?
It's odd.
Now.
I don't know why.
I want you to fucking,</v>

159
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:30.600
you can fucking do you want to way to,
once you slide over,
I'll fucking drive.

160
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:34.660
I know how to get home.
Um,
all right.
Jesus Christ.

161
00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:39.540
This is why I don't do the podcast.
One of when I flew that day,
um,

162
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.490
as I mentioned that,

163
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:45.810
cause I'm like extra crabby and I had a great time,
by the way.
I'm in Cleveland,

164
00:09:45.811 --> 00:09:50.190
Ohio.
Uh,
every time I come back there,
the downtown areas more alive.

165
00:09:50.191 --> 00:09:51.860
I remember working at hit,
uh,

166
00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:57.330
hilarides for the first time in 2004 was again in 2003 I was doing new year's

167
00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:03.300
first time at Jason Lyon and a bunch of Cleveland guys and I just remember just

168
00:10:03.301 --> 00:10:06.240
looking at the downtown area and there wasn't shit down there.

169
00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:12.260
I mean I was staying at the Holiday Inn Express right around the corner and they

170
00:10:12.451 --> 00:10:14.340
had to get me a fucking escort home.

171
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:17.610
I was literally walking a block and a half and I was thankful that they gave it

172
00:10:17.611 --> 00:10:21.960
to me.
I did a fast paced walk over to the club before the show.

173
00:10:21.961 --> 00:10:25.560
So I remember looking across the street and it was this big apartment building.

174
00:10:25.561 --> 00:10:27.540
I remember just thinking like,
man,
if I had the fucking money

175
00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:31.490
I would buy that and Redo it and I would be,

176
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:35.600
I would make a fortune on it and you know,
didn't have the money.

177
00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:40.340
And now every time I go back there,
you should see it now.
Like,
like hilarity,

178
00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:43.670
his was the only game in town there on this dark street.

179
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.100
Now you show up at literally life.
Like I said this before,

180
00:10:46.101 --> 00:10:49.970
it looks like the fucking Bullwinkle show is a house of Blues.

181
00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.600
There's this place called a,
I don't know,
some craft beer places.

182
00:10:53.601 --> 00:10:54.680
All of this shit.

183
00:10:56.050 --> 00:11:00.080
This gift shop t shirts store where they have all this stupid Cleveland stuff.

184
00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.440
They look like Dave was soft t shirts.

185
00:11:03.441 --> 00:11:05.840
I liked a lot of them and I actually like Ohio,

186
00:11:05.841 --> 00:11:10.841
but like the nickname for Cleveland calling it the land is just,

187
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:15.680
it's so bad.
The Land Pittsburgh,

188
00:11:15.681 --> 00:11:20.100
the Berg
is Cincinnati,
the natty.

189
00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:24.840
It's so fucking terrific.
I thought Beantown was bad.

190
00:11:24.841 --> 00:11:29.280
I always hated that growing up in Boston and the millennials started calling it

191
00:11:29.281 --> 00:11:30.140
the bean.

192
00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.360
So in Cleveland they have these fucking tee shirts.

193
00:11:36.361 --> 00:11:41.361
It says defend the land from what you seceding from the union.

194
00:11:42.961 --> 00:11:46.320
What are you talking about?
Uh,
I was happy for him.
You know,

195
00:11:46.321 --> 00:11:48.660
they won their championship and all that type of shit,
you know,

196
00:11:48.661 --> 00:11:50.310
and they're looking good.
Jesus Christ.

197
00:11:50.311 --> 00:11:54.970
Absolutely fucking destroying the Toronto Raptors.

198
00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:57.950
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

199
00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:01.680
<v 1>You know,
I was going to say,
I had a theory about the,
uh,
you know,</v>

200
00:12:01.681 --> 00:12:04.140
if you name your team after some fucking movie shit,

201
00:12:04.141 --> 00:12:08.250
like the Anaheim mighty ducks,
the raptors,
we all know that's from Jurassic Park.

202
00:12:08.251 --> 00:12:12.330
Like you never going to win a championship,
but goddamn ducks did.

203
00:12:12.331 --> 00:12:14.250
But they had to stop being the mighty ducks.

204
00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:17.470
I remember when they first came out,

205
00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:20.920
there were the mighty ducks at the exact same uniforms as those little kids,

206
00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:23.140
which is basically the bad news bears on ice.

207
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.570
And then they would up on the diamond vision,

208
00:12:25.571 --> 00:12:30.571
they would have like Emilio Estevez clip from the movie of him given a Rah Rah

209
00:12:31.091 --> 00:12:32.350
speech to a bunch of children.

210
00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:36.760
And I'll tell you when they actually want a cup after that shit.

211
00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:39.310
That really hurt me as a Bruins fan going like,

212
00:12:39.311 --> 00:12:43.210
did we lose to a fucking team named after a kid movie?

213
00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.150
I Dunno.
So anyways,
statement kicking the shit out of him.

214
00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:52.240
And how about the Celtics Celtics continuing to fucking move through the

215
00:12:52.361 --> 00:12:57.250
playoffs?
Up Two games to none against the west.
How about it?

216
00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:01.930
He thought that was on death row.
Hold,
I can't believe it.

217
00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:07.360
The Boston Celtics brand of basketball,
other than their refusal to quit,

218
00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:12.070
I cannot fucking believe that we're winning.
We don't get any rebounds.

219
00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:17.290
Was soft in the fucking paint.
We live and die by the three.
I mean,

220
00:13:17.291 --> 00:13:19.610
that was that right there that you would say it was just the death of you.

221
00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:22.300
And somehow,
you know,
I never going to run into that.
You know,

222
00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:24.640
if we get by the wizards,
you never know what the fucking happened.

223
00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:28.450
But when we run into that Cleveland Cavalier buzzsaw that that's just going to

224
00:13:28.451 --> 00:13:32.920
be it.
It's going to be,
we're not going to have enough fucking answers.
Uh,

225
00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.770
Kelly Olynyk trying to cover fucking

226
00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:42.160
Hell Lebron James or Al Horford,
what's he gonna do?
He's not going to fucking,

227
00:13:42.161 --> 00:13:44.830
you know.
Um,
anyways,
I,

228
00:13:44.831 --> 00:13:47.890
I mentioned a couple podcasts ago that,
uh,

229
00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:51.550
my wife had gone rogue when it came to the Dvr and all that and I promise that

230
00:13:51.551 --> 00:13:56.550
she ever talked to her about it with you guys.
Um,
a mayday.

231
00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:04.750
Your,
your request on the,
uh,
the podcast
you request,

232
00:14:04.751 --> 00:14:08.710
you know,
your,
your,
your presence is requested to is why I don't do pot.

233
00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:11.800
I hate donut when I fly.
Um,

234
00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:16.010
yeah.
You got a mic.
You got everything.

235
00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.650
Here you go.
All right.

236
00:14:21.651 --> 00:14:24.080
Now we're going to have to have a nice measured conversation.

237
00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:25.820
Don't touch my luggage.

238
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:29.710
You don't have it like comfortable for guests right now.
Oh,

239
00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.040
that's why I never have guests.

240
00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.033
<v 0>Hold on.</v>

241
00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:39.450
<v 1>All right.
She's got to do the whole thing here.
Okay.
Oh,
who is this other person?</v>

242
00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:44.190
And she wasn't,
she wasn't booked.
What's up baby?

243
00:14:44.191 --> 00:14:47.910
How are you?
Hi.
Let's,
let's get,

244
00:14:47.911 --> 00:14:52.100
let's it to get her situated and she's fine.
She's,
she's changed.

245
00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.660
Um,
anyways,
Nia.
Yes.

246
00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:02.300
You've gone [inaudible] gone rogue.
First of all.
Welcome on the 10th anniversary.

247
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:05.480
Happy Anniversary.
Yeah,
that's 10 years.

248
00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.610
10 years of a run in my year

249
00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:14.750
and no idea where this was going to go.
And now look at me all these years later.

250
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:19.730
I remember sitting in my jeans and t shirt.
Yeah,
exactly like I was 10 years ago.

251
00:15:19.731 --> 00:15:23.270
I have the exact same level of technology.
I don't have a theme song.

252
00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:24.440
I haven't done anything.

253
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.550
Although you didn't have a soundboard and stuff before you just used to like,

254
00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:32.030
oh yeah,
I usually call phone.
Yeah.
You used to call on the phone?
Yup.

255
00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:35.060
How did that work you?
You called up some service?

256
00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:37.730
I used to do it when I was on the phone.

257
00:15:37.731 --> 00:15:40.610
I would drive around and I'd be getting the arguments with other people in the

258
00:15:40.611 --> 00:15:45.140
cars and I would be at the airport and I just make fun of fun of people were
gay.

259
00:15:45.141 --> 00:15:47.150
What gave you the idea to do a podcast?

260
00:15:47.151 --> 00:15:50.480
I mean obviously it was became a big thing 10 years ago,

261
00:15:50.481 --> 00:15:53.510
but was there somebody or something that happened that made you think like,

262
00:15:53.511 --> 00:15:57.920
I need to get it on this?
You know,
I feel like I didn't choose podcasting.

263
00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:02.690
Podcasting chose me.
Yeah,
no,

264
00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:07.340
it was over a Bobby Kelly's apartment by Bobby's right.

265
00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:09.920
I was over there and he was like,
dude,
you should do a podcast.

266
00:16:09.921 --> 00:16:12.920
So we just set the thing up.
You know,

267
00:16:12.921 --> 00:16:17.120
it was like Bobby Kelly,
shit,
Bobby into technology and I was like that.

268
00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:19.470
It may be in the old crabby guy.
Even back then go do it.

269
00:16:19.471 --> 00:16:22.280
I don't want to do that stuff.
Just you'll just say up to you to get away.

270
00:16:22.281 --> 00:16:26.480
Connect with the fans bro.
He was Ryan.
Yes he was.

271
00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:29.330
He was right.
He was right on that one.
You know what?

272
00:16:29.331 --> 00:16:33.560
He was wrong about you or Bobby Kelly was wrong about the mini cds.

273
00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.790
[inaudible] CDs.
Yeah.
When they was regular size cds,

274
00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:42.610
he talked me into getting a mini CD.
Oh,
I,
yeah,

275
00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.770
like that was going to take off and then I had to buy the microphone.

276
00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:50.120
That was seven set up like a little tea.
I followed him for like two months.

277
00:16:50.121 --> 00:16:55.121
I followed him down over the cliff of buying every piece of technology and then

278
00:16:55.761 --> 00:16:59.930
I just went back to the fucking,
the way I was.
So anyways,
yes.

279
00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:01.550
So know what's going on.

280
00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:04.670
You know there's all these great shows out there that we used to watch together.

281
00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:08.210
Well better call
Saul Fargo.

282
00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:13.100
Meet me at the mall.
Good seasons.
All right.
All of these great shows.
Yeah,

283
00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:16.640
and used to watch them with me and now all of a sudden,

284
00:17:16.641 --> 00:17:20.720
not only do you not watch them with me,
you kind of erase them or decide,

285
00:17:20.721 --> 00:17:24.410
you know,
it was some other show not to show.
As I just mentioned,

286
00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:28.220
there was some other show we started to watch and you decided that you were over

287
00:17:28.221 --> 00:17:32.420
it and you just,
you just stop recording it.
Okay.

288
00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:37.660
Well you know probably because there's a way to watch it on like the Roku or on

289
00:17:38.751 --> 00:17:41.480
demand.
Now for me,
I can't figure that out.

290
00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:44.870
I have showed you that countless times.
I know.
Show you again,

291
00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:46.310
but I'm not going to keep,

292
00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:49.620
I like to say how many times I told you how to shut the water off when there's a

293
00:17:49.621 --> 00:17:53.310
flood in the house.
There's certain things that were good at

294
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:54.430
<v 0>okay.</v>

295
00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:58.270
<v 1>Huh?
Oh,
you didn't like that.
Did you know my eye contact?</v>

296
00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:01.750
<v 3>Really?</v>

297
00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:07.350
<v 1>Nia.
Me.
What?</v>

298
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:13.000
What didn't you like about that comment?
Oh,

299
00:18:13.001 --> 00:18:16.210
this is getting real.
This is like fucking some Wendy Williams shit right now.

300
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:20.610
You stopped staring at me like you're going to beat the crap.

301
00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:25.740
I hear to talk about the Dvr and the TV show stuff.
We were,

302
00:18:25.741 --> 00:18:26.940
I think that is what I use.

303
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:29.820
Throwing that other evidence out that's made and told me,

304
00:18:29.821 --> 00:18:30.780
is that what you're doing here?

305
00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:33.990
I thought that was totally who to like flip the script is not,

306
00:18:33.991 --> 00:18:37.620
that's not what I agreed to.
One 12 white people do not flip the script.

307
00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:41.760
We have a misdirection.
We changed the subject.

308
00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:46.250
I didn't,
I didn't agree to this.
I'm here to talk about um,

309
00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:50.430
television and just like Billy Bob Thornton on that radio show and he said,

310
00:18:50.431 --> 00:18:53.230
don't bring up my movie career.
Just talking about my drum career.

311
00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:57.570
What's going on with you?

312
00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:04.060
<v 3>How do you know what you,
you change,
change,</v>

313
00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:05.870
change,
change.
Well,
first of all,

314
00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:09.680
one thing it hasn't changed is your inability to talk into a microphone.
Sorry,

315
00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:13.430
love it.
Just pointed at the side of your face.

316
00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:18.680
I'm just saying now that we've got the little one here.
Yes.

317
00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:20.390
Well here's the thing.

318
00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:25.190
Bell is that you're running around all day and so I'm here with her and so I

319
00:19:25.191 --> 00:19:29.930
watch the shows then because it's like there's not really much to do,
you know,

320
00:19:29.931 --> 00:19:31.520
I'm just kind of breastfeeding all day.

321
00:19:31.521 --> 00:19:33.650
There's not a whole heck of a lot to do with her.

322
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:39.470
So I watch it and because you're busy and then at night when we do get time to

323
00:19:40.191 --> 00:19:43.820
watch stuff,
you watch it for like 10 minutes and then you fall asleep.

324
00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:48.050
Just cause I can never in the morning.
I understand that,
but I don't.

325
00:19:48.051 --> 00:19:50.060
So then I don't get a chance to really learn enough.

326
00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:52.760
Fair enough to get a do you got to erase it then you've got to make the

327
00:19:52.761 --> 00:19:56.480
decisions on like what I get to watch.
No,
like,
well that's it for you.

328
00:19:56.750 --> 00:20:01.310
And if you find,
if you turn on your Roku thing and download the news,

329
00:20:01.311 --> 00:20:04.820
so simple like my mom does the Roku,
like it's that,
it's that easy.

330
00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:08.430
<v 1>So I was turning on and off a faucet outside the house.
All right,</v>

331
00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:09.720
well this has been fun.

332
00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:11.413
<v 0>Okay,</v>

333
00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:16.890
<v 1>I'm leaving.
You're not leaving.
No one's ever walked off this show.</v>

334
00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:23.160
Who are you?
What are you doing right now?

335
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.770
You keep

336
00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:29.220
<v 3>belittling me of how easy it is you use Roku.
How has that political,</v>

337
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:32.850
I said it's easy.
You're the one who doesn't have the power.
You said well now,

338
00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:36.320
now you said what did I say?
You said even your mother can do it.

339
00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:39.890
It's self to me a little bit.
Little bit.
You'd sell to me a little bit.

340
00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:43.990
Why is my mother,
I'm just saying she's not the best at technology,
but

341
00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:47.980
<v 1>she knows how to use the no,
what you're saying it's as what I'm saying.</v>

342
00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:51.820
<v 3>Alright.
You know,
I thought it was going to be a lot of comedy in this</v>

343
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:57.160
woefully Ms Judge

344
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:04.410
how this was going to go.
No,
I know I went rogue.
I know I did,
but let's like,

345
00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:06.590
yeah,
here we go.
Four minutes in.
All right.
Yeah,

346
00:21:06.591 --> 00:21:10.990
I mean I just can't sit around waiting for you to like watch 10 I got tired of

347
00:21:10.991 --> 00:21:15.991
watching episodes in 10 minute increments because you fall asleep and what am I

348
00:21:16.001 --> 00:21:19.180
supposed to do?
I'm not yet.
I'm not tired yet,

349
00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:21.370
so I want to finish watching the show.

350
00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:25.900
I got to turn it off just because you fall asleep and it takes like six weeks to

351
00:21:25.901 --> 00:21:29.950
get through two episodes.
That's insane.
I think you're exaggerating a little bit.

352
00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:30.610
I am,

353
00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:35.610
but the point is that I'm not going to wait for your ass to watch shows anymore.

354
00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:39.640
It's just we're not on the same schedule,
so it's doesn't,

355
00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:43.870
it's not really practical for us to like watch TV together like that.
Okay.

356
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:46.930
So that part of our relationship is,
I would definitely,
it's over.

357
00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.880
All right.
Well here's the thing.
Yes.

358
00:21:51.881 --> 00:21:55.540
Stop deciding,
you know,

359
00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:59.560
being judged during execution on the death penalty for the shows that we record.

360
00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:03.640
Uh Huh.
Okay.
And you know what's weird is,
you know,
I had all my self to games,

361
00:22:03.641 --> 00:22:08.140
a Bruins games,
games are quarter summary.
I like three times.

362
00:22:08.141 --> 00:22:10.240
I didn't finish the accusation.

363
00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:15.520
I know three times this season I had to go back to get to start,
you know,

364
00:22:15.521 --> 00:22:18.670
I had seasoned record,
I had three times I had to go back and do it.

365
00:22:18.671 --> 00:22:21.840
And somehow that never seems to happen.
To your shows.
Only the my show.

366
00:22:21.841 --> 00:22:26.841
So I can only surmise that the DVR doesn't like me.

367
00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:31.930
I did not.
No,
I contact change.

368
00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:33.700
I'll look right at you.
I didn't,

369
00:22:33.701 --> 00:22:37.170
I didn't change the recording series for your sports stuff.
Mm.

370
00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:40.300
Never been in the middle of recording two things that you like at the same time.

371
00:22:40.301 --> 00:22:41.770
And this is all,
there's not enough space.

372
00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:43.690
You need to stop recording on one thing.

373
00:22:43.691 --> 00:22:46.090
And you never chose my stuff over your stuff.
No,

374
00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:49.510
because it can record up to five things simultaneously.
All right.

375
00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:51.880
You're recording five things and then there's one more.

376
00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:53.800
Have you gone through the Dvr list?

377
00:22:53.801 --> 00:22:58.360
Have you noted that like 98% of it is your stuff?
It's a complete lie.

378
00:22:58.361 --> 00:23:03.040
You just paid it,
but yes,
I do want to bet.
I'll bet.
Yeah,

379
00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:06.970
I'll bet you.
What do you want to bet?
I Dunno.
What should we bet?
Well,

380
00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:11.360
you're the one who brought it up.
Um,
no,
I brought it the bed.
Sorry.
I'm of it,

381
00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:15.250
you know,
I don't know.
It's just many gentleman's bet.
Okay.

382
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:21.010
Well,
you know,
if I was dealing with a gentleman,
oh,
I'm a gentle woman.

383
00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:22.960
How about that?
I'm going to need the hospital.

384
00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:28.160
You just lady race and my stuff.
I don't appreciate bill,

385
00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:33.180
you have gushers thousands Patriot's games from Surrey from three years ago.

386
00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:37.210
It's a Superbowl.
We want it,
but do you go back and watch it ever?

387
00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:41.080
Why is it sitting there near?
That's one thing I know,

388
00:23:41.081 --> 00:23:45.830
but it's like four hours.
It's a super bowl.
I know he'd beat the Seahawks.

389
00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:48.680
Okay,
but are you going to go back and watch it if I actually,

390
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:54.890
okay,
but everything else is gone.
I all the fast and loud,
I get rid of those.

391
00:23:54.891 --> 00:23:55.850
I've seen all of those.

392
00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:58.940
I get rid of all my Bruins and Celtics and get rid of those.

393
00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:02.840
There's a bunch of games as much as sports related documentaries and stuff that

394
00:24:02.841 --> 00:24:06.890
you haven't watched because you don't have time to watch a lot of the TV,

395
00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:08.091
which is fine,

396
00:24:08.091 --> 00:24:13.091
but I'm just saying that's the reason why I have decided to just press forward.

397
00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:17.770
Fair enough.
Full of the TV watching.
I wish you the best of luck.

398
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:22.450
If you cheat with your,
with your,
with your TV viewing.
No,
with your TV viewing.

399
00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:27.980
I enjoyed watching TV with you.
Oh and uh,

400
00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:31.750
yeah,
it's just an end.
So,
okay,

401
00:24:31.751 --> 00:24:35.500
well then let's figure out a solution.
Like how can we get back on track?

402
00:24:35.501 --> 00:24:38.620
How can we get this right of our relationship back on track?
This is like there,

403
00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:40.660
I don't know.
What can we do

404
00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:45.420
in order to get on the same page?
Look,

405
00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:48.510
if you're bored out of your mind during the day and you need to watch a good

406
00:24:48.511 --> 00:24:52.410
show,
yeah,
by all means do it.
Whatever.
I just needed an explanation,
I guess.

407
00:24:52.411 --> 00:24:54.390
That's all right.
I'll learn how I tell you what.

408
00:24:54.391 --> 00:24:58.620
I'll learn how to use the Roku and you learn how to shut off the water the next

409
00:24:58.621 --> 00:25:00.330
time.
One of these old as pipes burst.

410
00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:06.680
What?
Why is it such a big deal,
nick?

411
00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:10.950
Why do you keep bringing it up and you're trying to like humiliate me and

412
00:25:10.951 --> 00:25:11.784
embarrass me?

413
00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:17.070
I'm bringing it up because every time you talk to her like that,

414
00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:20.040
I turn off the water.
I did and I called the plumber.

415
00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.770
The makes him the very next day.
Yes,
I did.

416
00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:26.280
So I'm tired of you making it seem like I don't know what the hell is going on.

417
00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:30.650
Okay.
I was here by myself.
I was very well baby.
Yes.
I turn it off.

418
00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:37.320
Turn it off.
Yeah,
I did.
And that crazy ass flooding that was going on.

419
00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:42.000
So I cleaned up by myself.
[inaudible]

420
00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:45.450
it's a little valve.
It's like it's blue.
It's the color of water.

421
00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:52.470
Why cool.
Was that easy?
I could do it.
I forgot to do that part.

422
00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.050
Okay.
I know.

423
00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:58.590
And I called the plumber and they told me that it was fine and it was fine.

424
00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:03.010
I know because we got lucky.
Yeah.

425
00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:05.730
It's not like you made a judgment call gone.
You know it's coming from there.

426
00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:08.510
I would take it out from the front of the house.
You didn't,
you didn't do it.

427
00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:11.340
What I was going through.
You are starting your face.

428
00:26:11.341 --> 00:26:14.970
You didn't do all you do whenever stuff like that happens when you're on the

429
00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.590
road is giving me shit up.
No,

430
00:26:16.591 --> 00:26:20.400
I will not give me shit about it over and over again instead of being like,

431
00:26:20.401 --> 00:26:24.090
I understand you were alone,
you were panicked.
You don't handle the situations.

432
00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:27.660
Thank God everything was okay.
Thank God you're okay.
Thank God the baby's okay.

433
00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:33.750
Dam didn't break thing that I did wrong and how I didn't add the way you would

434
00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:38.010
have acted.
You know what?
I think we learned here that I don't appreciate it.

435
00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:39.190
Okay.
I

436
00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:46.560
pay you guys listening.
You want me to flip out?

437
00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:53.700
Yeah.
Poking me and poking me about it.
That was a month ago now.

438
00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:57.240
Like let it go.
You've completely lost your composure.
Yeah.

439
00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:59.470
Cause you're pissing me off.
All right.

440
00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:03.830
You know what I learned in this conversation?
Nothing knowing you.

441
00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:14.090
I have learned that I'm a little bit better handling criticism than you are.
No,

442
00:27:14.091 --> 00:27:17.420
you are not.
Listen,
no,

443
00:27:17.421 --> 00:27:21.890
you are the most sensitive jackass I've ever met in my end,
but I only took it.

444
00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:24.770
Okay,
fair enough.
But I only took it to tit for tat.

445
00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:28.850
You said Roco and so your petty too.
Okay.
So I'm petty,
but I mean,

446
00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.890
I'm not the one yelling and flipping out here.

447
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:34.610
I am a passionate person and when I am feeling a certain way,

448
00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:39.530
but the euphemisms though,
that's not a euphemism.
Yes,
it is a euphemism to this.

449
00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:41.780
It's a nicer word for being a Douche.

450
00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:49.280
Instead of saying instead saying,
listen to me.
Instead of saying yes,
I did.

451
00:27:49.281 --> 00:27:54.140
Just like you know who um,
two rights don't make,

452
00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:58.850
wait,
no two wrong.
All right.
You're right.
No,

453
00:27:58.851 --> 00:28:00.400
it's like instead of saying shell shocked,

454
00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:04.580
you say post traumatic stress disorder,
um,

455
00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:08.810
set of saying innocent people died.
You say collateral damage.
That's a euphemism.

456
00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:12.500
Oh,
all right.
Okay.
So there you go.

457
00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.440
Instead of saying that you were an angry Lula tick,
you say you're passionate.

458
00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:20.300
I'm not.
You're the angry lunatic.
I think we can all agree,
not me.

459
00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:24.720
I am not.
I am the steady easy one.
Oh yeah.
Really?
Yeah.
Yeah.

460
00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:27.750
Crazy one.
I don't know when I had to threaten to like,

461
00:28:27.751 --> 00:28:29.840
if you hit me one more time during an argument,

462
00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:33.050
I'm not going to go out with you anymore.
When I met you,

463
00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:37.370
you were a grower and you were here.
Oh my God.
You just have,

464
00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:39.710
you got to run for office.
She will answer for everything.

465
00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:44.740
I was young and I was hashing it sure is young and immature and I didn't know

466
00:28:45.591 --> 00:28:49.950
how to handle my emotions and I do now.
Okay.
All right.

467
00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:53.570
What did you check yourself into?
Rehab.
Let's see.
Have a tech.

468
00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:59.600
I punched him in the face.
I need to go to rehab or punched you in the face.

469
00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:04.660
You did it.
Stop did it on Valentine's Day,
but she did.
Yes.

470
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:09.510
She did.
Not In the face and the face.
Yes.
Yes

471
00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:17.700
you did.
I didn't punch you in the face.
I don't know.

472
00:29:17.701 --> 00:29:21.390
I took you to that fancy Sushi restaurant.
We were living in New York.

473
00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:23.680
I took you down to that thing and the dude,

474
00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:28.350
the dude from the phone booth movie was there,
right?
Oh,
I'm in a phone booth.

475
00:29:28.351 --> 00:29:31.650
They won't let me leave.
Right.
He's in that fucking thing.

476
00:29:31.651 --> 00:29:35.490
That Nice low budget movie.
The whole movie takes place in a phone booth.

477
00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:39.720
We love it.
Low budget,
Cute Irish guy.
Right.

478
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:41.970
Me As a ridiculous,
well,
you wouldn't

479
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.410
<v 1>know that when you,
the way you were looking at him in the Sushi restaurant,</v>

480
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:47.600
you just kept looking at the guy,
which was fine for the first,
you know,

481
00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:48.431
10 minutes.

482
00:29:48.431 --> 00:29:52.720
Then after awhile you just looking at another guy where I'm paying 10 times what

483
00:29:52.721 --> 00:29:56.020
Sushi should cost were to sell.
Exaggerating.
What happened.

484
00:29:56.021 --> 00:29:58.380
I wasn't staring at Collin for all the entire,

485
00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:03.110
what are you going to validate my feelings?
Yeah.

486
00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:06.820
I believe there was a song written about everything you've said on this podcast

487
00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:11.030
back in the 80s.
It went something like this.
Yeah,

488
00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:16.540
Dude.
The last lot that yeah,
to the bigger,

489
00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:20.240
the better.
Lou.
That was the Thompson twins.
Uh,

490
00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:24.160
how long had we been dating before that incident?
I don't know.

491
00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:29.200
But what ended up happening was I got in the cab and I bought it with the cab

492
00:30:29.201 --> 00:30:30.760
driver and I just said it got big buddy.

493
00:30:30.761 --> 00:30:33.790
Let me ask you a question and stuck my big head to that stupid little window.

494
00:30:33.791 --> 00:30:37.510
I got you.
Took you woman out on Valentine's state for Sushi.
All right.

495
00:30:37.511 --> 00:30:41.530
Famous guy walks in.
How long do you give her to look at the famous guy before,

496
00:30:41.531 --> 00:30:46.210
after a while and then public for that long.
Wow.
I never thought of it that way.

497
00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:50.380
I don't mean farming out.
I don't know what,
I mean,
I was young.
I had to,

498
00:30:50.381 --> 00:30:53.290
I had to get some sort of victory.
I was trying to marry the line.
No,

499
00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:56.280
I was trying to make you as upset as you made me and it,

500
00:30:56.420 --> 00:31:00.270
and I did it a little too well because by the end of the night we were back in

501
00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:03.400
the apartment and you came running out of the bedroom because of course I'm

502
00:31:03.401 --> 00:31:05.650
sleeping on the couch.
Of course I'm sleeping on the couch.

503
00:31:05.651 --> 00:31:09.490
I wasn't looking at anybody else and I paid for the move for the meal.
Of course,

504
00:31:09.491 --> 00:31:13.120
I ended up on the couch.
And uh,

505
00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:17.020
you said something like that as some Bob bitching or something.
I said,
yeah,

506
00:31:17.021 --> 00:31:19.840
well you're acting like one and I'd never called you that word now I'm sorry.

507
00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:24.850
Here,
just two little feet.
Lord was not in the word in question.

508
00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:29.500
That was not the word in question.
And you know it was a douchebag.
No,

509
00:31:29.501 --> 00:31:33.430
it was not.
And you were saying,
why do you guys to speak into the microphone?

510
00:31:33.431 --> 00:31:35.560
I got to act like such a,
you know what?

511
00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:36.993
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

512
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:41.600
<v 1>And I lost my shit.
No I didn't.
No I didn't.
No,
I didn't.
This is what I said.</v>

513
00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:45.740
What did I say?
I didn't say.
I would never say no cause that's calling you one,

514
00:31:45.741 --> 00:31:49.640
which I've never done.
Never did that.
Yeah,

515
00:31:49.641 --> 00:31:52.580
you kind of did in there one time.
No,
I didn't.

516
00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:55.970
You know you'd like to disguise it behind acting like a,

517
00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:58.170
see this is a thing that I tell you something there.

518
00:31:58.280 --> 00:31:59.960
Can I tell you like I tell you something,

519
00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:04.430
you acting like I didn't say you were a,
you're acting like a fair enough.

520
00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:07.070
But here's the thing.
I've been with you for 14 years.

521
00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:10.820
You have two incidents despite your behavior.

522
00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:12.950
How many times you know what for those two incidents,

523
00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:16.060
how many times did you hit me?
I'm going to time you came in?
Yes.

524
00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:20.150
Through my laundry.
All over the living room.
You haven't we freaking psycho.

525
00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:26.240
I don't remember that.
Once your fluffy white socks and underwear like oh my God.

526
00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:33.260
Ah,
another example of your passion.

527
00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:38.480
I've shown unbelievable restraint dealing with a woman like you.

528
00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:41.930
Oh,
a woman like me.
Yes.
Yes.

529
00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:46.040
All congratulate fucking lesions.
You got a beautiful baby out of it.

530
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:51.310
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

531
00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:55.670
<v 1>Is All right.
Oh,
we had a good time.
Yeah,</v>

532
00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:59.240
we had a nice run.
No,
it's all about her.

533
00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:04.040
And evidently we're just going to be watching up separate stuff on TV.
No,

534
00:33:04.041 --> 00:33:07.760
we can't be that couple.
We had to like,
you know,
still remain a tight,

535
00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:08.661
I have to go see it.

536
00:33:08.661 --> 00:33:11.000
Most Times I fall asleep at night because you're watching those,

537
00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:15.230
those women yelling at each other.
I hate those shows now.
I know I why know that.

538
00:33:15.231 --> 00:33:17.930
But we could be watching anything and you'll fall asleep cause you do,

539
00:33:17.931 --> 00:33:21.560
you get up super early.
You're really busy throughout the day.
It makes sense.

540
00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:23.450
So I get why you fall asleep,

541
00:33:23.451 --> 00:33:26.240
but I'm just saying like it's hard to watch a TV show with you that way.

542
00:33:28.290 --> 00:33:30.780
<v 0>That's it.
Okay.
All right,</v>

543
00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:34.380
<v 1>well listen,
it was nice talking to,
uh,
you know,
is that it?</v>

544
00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:37.620
Do I have to leave now?
Well,
I mean I got to read some advertising.

545
00:33:37.621 --> 00:33:41.490
If you want to sit here and listen to that.
No,
Jesus.
I know deals.

546
00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:42.483
Can you read out loud?

547
00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:45.990
Don't let her listen to that either because that'll be hope.

548
00:33:45.991 --> 00:33:50.070
She doesn't get that from me.
I get what your inability to read out loud.

549
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:53.520
You know what it is.
It's my brain goes too fast.

550
00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:58.850
I find if I slow down when you read to her and so cute and so lovely.

551
00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:03.310
Oh yeah,
you guys have all this.
I actually I rehearsed before the podcasts.

552
00:34:03.311 --> 00:34:04.300
I read the advertising.

553
00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:09.440

of a podcast gone by in the last 10 years.
Oh,
by the way,

695
00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:15.350
remember when I told you to check out that band,
the night game,
Emma?

696
00:43:15.351 --> 00:43:16.970
That ball rumor has it,

697
00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:20.360
rumor has it that they're going to be opening for John Mayer.

698
00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:23.960
John Mayer has got a big tour,
um,

699
00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:27.560
going through the United States of America.
There's one stop in Toronto.

700
00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:28.930
The rest of them all.
Uh,

701
00:43:29.410 --> 00:43:32.070
I imagine he'll go around the globe with that cause it does say world tours.

702
00:43:32.071 --> 00:43:35.810
So this is probably the first leg of it.
And he's got two bands opening up.

703
00:43:35.811 --> 00:43:40.250
I forget the name of the other band,
but,
uh,
I believe,
uh,
the night game.

704
00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:41.930
I don't know if that's official hope.
It's official,

705
00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:44.270
open on fucking anything up for anybody,
but I,

706
00:43:44.271 --> 00:43:46.100
that was a band I told you guys to check out.

707
00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:50.300
[inaudible] the guy take drum lessons from,
um,

708
00:43:50.330 --> 00:43:54.860
is in that band with a bunch of other amazing studio musicians,
songwriters.

709
00:43:54.861 --> 00:43:59.030
They sound amazing.
So if you do catch John Mayer this summer,

710
00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:02.480
don't show up late.
Don't hang in the parking lot,

711
00:44:02.481 --> 00:44:05.690
shotgun beers or whatever the hell you kids do nowadays.

712
00:44:05.691 --> 00:44:09.140
Taking your Molly smoking your math,
right.

713
00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:14.090
Whatever the hell it is you kids do nowadays,
make sure you get in in time to,
um,

714
00:44:14.450 --> 00:44:15.560
to check out the night game.

715
00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:19.090
And I'm sure the other band is just as good because it doesn't seem like May,

716
00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:22.280
it brings any cupcakes out on the road.
Do you know what I mean?
Like,
you know,

717
00:44:22.281 --> 00:44:23.570
sometimes comedians will do that.

718
00:44:23.571 --> 00:44:25.970
They'll take somebody on the road that isn't as funny,
you know what I mean?

719
00:44:25.971 --> 00:44:29.420
So they don't bring too much heat,
you know?
But the really funny guys,

720
00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:33.420
they don't do that shit.
All right?
But not me.

721
00:44:33.421 --> 00:44:37.320
I bring cupcakes out on the road.
Like Joe de Rosa,
the original cupcake.

722
00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:40.620
He's heat Joe to Rosa is the cupcakes cupcake

723
00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:45.360
of standup comedy.
I miss that guy,
man.

724
00:44:45.361 --> 00:44:47.310
I got to have him back on the podcast at some point.
All right.

725
00:44:47.311 --> 00:44:50.190
Enjoy the music and the,
uh,
the greatest hits.
I'll talk to you on Monday.

726
00:45:56.570 --> 00:45:57.410
<v 5>Hey,
what's going on?</v>

727
00:45:57.510 --> 00:46:01.160
It's spill bar and this is the Monday morning podcasts for Monday,

728
00:46:01.161 --> 00:46:03.470
May 4th,

729
00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:07.220
2009 and I think this is the 15th time I've tried to do this podcast.

730
00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:09.860
As you can tell,
my voice is a little bit tired.

731
00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:14.950
I was just working Caroline's in New York City and I did a six shows and I think

732
00:46:16.501 --> 00:46:20.010
I overdid it a little bit even though I was drinking tea.
You know,

733
00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:23.930
start doing that.
Drinking tea with a little bit of honey in it for my shows.

734
00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:29.210
Doing a little fucking vocal,
warm up,
you know?
I mean,
you know,

735
00:46:29.211 --> 00:46:33.500
so I can save my instrument.
I know.
Let's the gays fucking thing ever,
isn't it?

736
00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:34.400
I don't give a fuck.

737
00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:38.930
I have to do it or I'll say end up sounding like this when I,
when I,
when,

738
00:46:38.931 --> 00:46:43.370
when I don't do it,
you know,
I don't know.

739
00:46:43.370 --> 00:46:45.740
It was a weird week in New York.
I didn't do anything.
I just,
I,

740
00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:50.690
I was holed up in my hotel like fucking Howard Hughes.
That's what I do.

741
00:46:50.691 --> 00:46:52.580
Like the further east I go,

742
00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:57.080
the more fucked up it is for me to get up in the morning to do a radio obviously

743
00:46:57.110 --> 00:47:00.650
because if I have to get into the radio station at 7:00 AM east coast time,

744
00:47:00.651 --> 00:47:05.060
that's 4:00 AM my time.
And uh,
that's how I ended up getting sick,

745
00:47:05.061 --> 00:47:06.110
burning at a bolt then.

746
00:47:06.111 --> 00:47:10.850
So I started taking these vitamin C pills because they were freaking everybody

747
00:47:10.851 --> 00:47:15.770
out about the fucking swine flu,
which once again turned out to be nothing.

748
00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:21.260
How many flus in a row are they going to scare the shit out of,
out of us about,

749
00:47:21.261 --> 00:47:25.370
you know,
and you notice every flu.
It's like,
like how did it come about?

750
00:47:25.371 --> 00:47:30.100
It's always somebody had sex with an animal,
somebody,
another country had

751
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:34.720
<v 6>sex with an animal,
which is so like nobody is fucking animals in this country.</v>

752
00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:36.693
You know,

753
00:47:37.810 --> 00:47:42.050
I think the CIA puts the shit out that just doing some experiments they need to

754
00:47:42.051 --> 00:47:43.240
thin the fucking heard.

755
00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:46.540
So what they do is they just put the shit out and then they just blame

756
00:47:46.541 --> 00:47:49.540
foreigners and then they add beastiality into it.

757
00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:53.350
So then it just makes sense to Joe lunchbox.
You know,

758
00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:57.010
you can just see him sitting around the fucking canteen truck,
the Roach coach,

759
00:47:57.011 --> 00:48:01.290
whatever you call it,
in your neck of the woods.
And I door the fucking swine flu,

760
00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:04.830
you know.
Well,
we tell,
what's his life?

761
00:48:04.831 --> 00:48:08.890
Who does some guy down in Mexico?
Dude,
he fucking,
he fucked the peg.

762
00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:13.150
He fought a fucking pig.
You know,
we've got plenty of pigs in this country.

763
00:48:13.151 --> 00:48:17.950
You don't see anybody fucking dump those fucking people in Mexico.
Fucking pigs,

764
00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:21.490
dogs just like aids,
those fucking some guy in Africa,
you know,

765
00:48:21.491 --> 00:48:25.450
he fox a monkey and he jerks off the stewardess.
And next thing you know,

766
00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:29.180
I got to wear condom.
It's fucking bullshit deal.

767
00:48:29.181 --> 00:48:32.740
We should close the fucking board is,
um,

768
00:48:32.741 --> 00:48:35.320
notice that was all done in a pseudo Boston accent.

769
00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:38.380
And because that's where I heard most of those conversations as I was growing up

770
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:41.530
when I worked in a warehouse and I got to met some of the Times I was the guy

771
00:48:41.531 --> 00:48:46.531
saying them as I went out and I got a sausage king for breakfast for my 10:30 AM

772
00:48:46.991 --> 00:48:49.270
break.
Remember that Shit.

773
00:48:49.271 --> 00:48:52.420
You worked in the warehouse and you're just sitting there and it's on Monday and

774
00:48:52.810 --> 00:48:56.410
the days just fly in.
Monday's didn't crawl.
Tuesday's crawled Monday.

775
00:48:56.530 --> 00:49:00.480
He was so fucking bleary eyed from your weekend that the day in some weird way

776
00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:02.680
kind of went by quickly,
you know,

777
00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:05.350
plus you know he kind of excited to get back to work.

778
00:49:05.350 --> 00:49:07.100
Whatever girl there you kinda got a crush on.

779
00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:08.560
You're trying to figure out how to fuck her.

780
00:49:08.650 --> 00:49:11.650
You haven't seen her in a couple of days.
So you've got that level of excitement,

781
00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:14.950
you know he got all that going on.

782
00:49:14.951 --> 00:49:18.260
Maybe a big year team when the big game the day before,
even if they didn't,

783
00:49:18.370 --> 00:49:21.650
you got something to talk about.
Some Monday goes by quick,
but then Tuesday,

784
00:49:21.890 --> 00:49:25.600
Tuesday is when it hits you.
Fuck,
I work here.

785
00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:30.250
I hate this.
This is going to be the same shit all over again.

786
00:49:31.090 --> 00:49:35.830
What the fuck am I doing with my life?
And then itches,
drags ass.

787
00:49:36.610 --> 00:49:39.290
I don't know about you guys,
but back when I had a real job before I,

788
00:49:39.291 --> 00:49:42.060
I just did this bullshit.
Um,

789
00:49:42.090 --> 00:49:45.730
I can't even begin to tell you how fucking long Tuesdays seemed,

790
00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:51.540
it was almost like the,
like the clock,
it was like they,
they're,

791
00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:55.060
they got phony clock on the wall and every minute was actually two minutes,

792
00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:58.120
you know,
I'm telling you it went by slow people.

793
00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:00.640
Why did I need to give that last example?
I don't know what,

794
00:50:00.641 --> 00:50:05.641
but all I know is why I lost a look at the clock like 85 times before 10 15 when

795
00:50:06.521 --> 00:50:09.990
the roach coach would come in and it would blow his horn that,
you know,
but that,

796
00:50:09.991 --> 00:50:14.140
that,
that,
that but tech a dad there,
it didn't do that.
It was something else.

797
00:50:14.141 --> 00:50:14.974
I can't remember,

798
00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:18.340
but it was one of those fucking fancy horns and everybody would just,

799
00:50:18.341 --> 00:50:22.360
a member was losing his shit was like the adult version of when the ice cream

800
00:50:22.361 --> 00:50:24.700
truck came down the street.
Remember that old Eddie Murphy bit,

801
00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:28.070
the ice cream man is coming.
Same Shit,
but for adults.

802
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:33.290
And then I would literally go out there and I would either get a slice of pizza

803
00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:37.040
off of this truck.
For those of you who always has had a white collar job,

804
00:50:37.041 --> 00:50:39.240
you never,
you know those,
those canteen trucks,
right?
The silver,

805
00:50:39.490 --> 00:50:41.180
it looks like a pickup truck in the front,
the back.

806
00:50:41.181 --> 00:50:45.760
It's all silver and they lift up the side and has all kinds of fucking,
uh,

807
00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:49.550
that's where the fucking swine flu comes from.
God Damn it.

808
00:50:49.551 --> 00:50:52.190
Probably those fucking trucks.
But anyways,

809
00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:56.390
then I would go out there and I would literally get like a slice of pizza like

810
00:50:56.420 --> 00:51:00.320
this and I don't know who made it,
you know what I mean?
Where,

811
00:51:00.321 --> 00:51:03.440
where was it made you get that?

812
00:51:03.441 --> 00:51:07.310
Or I get like a sausage king at 10 30 in the morning,
10 15 in the morning.

813
00:51:07.311 --> 00:51:09.890
And I would just eat that thing after booze and all weekend,

814
00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:14.240
probably downing every bit of 30 fucking beers.

815
00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:19.820
All right?
Probably getting six hours sleep.
If I was lucky,

816
00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:22.310
I had season tickets to the patriots.

817
00:51:22.311 --> 00:51:26.420
I abused my body on that day and then I would finish it off everyday.

818
00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:30.860
Just eaten a fucking sausage king or a slice of pizza.
Just something horrific.

819
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:36.260
And because I was young,
I had a washboard middle.
I mean,

820
00:51:36.261 --> 00:51:41.210
granted I was working out,
but I'm at the age now.
I,
I would,
I'd have to have,

821
00:51:41.211 --> 00:51:43.700
be on a treadmill the entire fucking day.

822
00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:48.380
That's just cruel.
So if you in your twenties,
enjoy it,

823
00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:53.430
enjoy it and develop some good fucking eating habits because,
uh,

824
00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:59.690
those days don't last right?
Admitted old people don't.

825
00:51:59.691 --> 00:52:03.140
You walk into Mcdonald's sometimes and you're feeling all fucking guilty and you

826
00:52:03.141 --> 00:52:05.960
just see some Douche bags,
not even douche bags.

827
00:52:05.961 --> 00:52:08.330
You just mad because they're young and they're over there laughing,

828
00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:13.580
having a great time.
Everybody's fucking in shape.
Chowing down,
you know,

829
00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:15.700
to make yourself feel better.
You looking over there go,

830
00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:19.360
there's four people over there.
You know what?
Statistically speaking,

831
00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:23.990
one of them's going to drop a heart attack and I'm still living,
so fuck it.

832
00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:29.540
It's like I started my life at this age.
I'm doing all right.
Right?
Yeah.

833
00:52:29.541 --> 00:52:33.680
Let me get the number three with a root beer.
I'm sorry sir.

834
00:52:33.681 --> 00:52:36.830
We don't have root beer is sprayed.
Okay.

835
00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:41.330
Is sprite even remotely like a root beer?
Huh?

836
00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:46.010
You did see count.
Why wouldn't you say coke least?
They're both Brown.

837
00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:50.870
All right,
sorry.
Um,
anyways,
this is the Monday morning podcast.

838
00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:54.290
I do one of these every single week out of the goodness of my heart.

839
00:52:54.890 --> 00:52:56.990
All the horrific things I do all week long.

840
00:52:56.991 --> 00:53:01.991
I wash away all of them every Monday by doing this podcast for my listeners.

841
00:53:03.111 --> 00:53:06.830
That's what I do.
That's why I do it.
This is how I repent,

842
00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:10.220
considering I don't go to church anymore.
You know,

843
00:53:12.290 --> 00:53:17.090
I haven't been to confession.
Confession.
How fucked up was that?

844
00:53:17.091 --> 00:53:21.050
You go in there and your rat yourself out to some other fucking Douche bag and

845
00:53:21.051 --> 00:53:24.230
he's acting like he's acting like,
oh,
you got,
you got to come to me.

846
00:53:24.231 --> 00:53:25.890
And then I'm going to tell God like God didn't

847
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:30.480
<v 5>watch everything that I just did.
You know,
I could,</v>

848
00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:34.250
I could do that shit in my bedroom.
You know what I mean?
That's like a,

849
00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:39.000
that's like when you got old technology,
you know what I mean?
Like me,

850
00:53:39.001 --> 00:53:43.560
I just bought an iPod not knowing that phones are basically iPods now.
Yeah.

851
00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:47.640
It just stupid.
It's an extra fucking,
I,
that's a terrible example.

852
00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:52.170
What am I trying to think of?
What am I,

853
00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:54.150
it's like they got what?
They've got wireless mikes now.

854
00:53:54.151 --> 00:53:55.790
For some reason I got a cord on this one.

855
00:53:55.850 --> 00:53:57.720
It could be walking all around my apartment making me,

856
00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:03.030
making myself a sandwich and I'm not,
that's another bad example.
Cheeses.

857
00:54:03.031 --> 00:54:04.860
I'm going to fucking hold there.
You know what I'm saying?

858
00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:09.450
I haven't been to confession in a long time and,
and uh,
I dunno.

859
00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:13.920
I would actually like to start going to church again.

860
00:54:13.921 --> 00:54:16.410
What do you think about that?
Does anybody got any good suggestions out there?

861
00:54:16.530 --> 00:54:20.250
We got a church where it's not the Catholic church.

862
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:26.000
It's not a church where the person you're in church with started the religion

863
00:54:28.590 --> 00:54:33.590
and it's somehow become a Christ like figure and is trying to brainwash you that

864
00:54:33.661 --> 00:54:36.360
it's okay for him to start having sex with your children.

865
00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:40.110
I don't join a cult.
Okay.

866
00:54:40.111 --> 00:54:43.860
Somewhere between a cult in an organized religion and I don't want any fucking

867
00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:48.540
Mr.
Good vibe shit.
Either.
God.
Well,

868
00:54:48.541 --> 00:54:50.370
why don't I start a church and we go,

869
00:54:52.340 --> 00:54:54.690
I know that's right because I'm not qualified.
I don't know what.

870
00:54:54.691 --> 00:54:58.410
You know what it is?
I like to discipline a church.
Oh,
speaking of that,

871
00:54:58.411 --> 00:55:02.400
you know what dudes I that he say dude's what are kind of assholes still says it

872
00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:04.770
.
You know what dudes,
let me lay this one on you.

873
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:09.240
I did bought the Bob and Tom Show.
I've been on the road for two weeks.

874
00:55:09.241 --> 00:55:12.120
By the way.
This is basically what happened.
I was working in Columbus,
Ohio,

875
00:55:12.330 --> 00:55:15.720
and then I was going on to work a Caroline's in New York City.

876
00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:18.990
So I had back to back weeks on the road and after that I can tell you what's

877
00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:20.353
underrated.
You know what's underrated?

878
00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:23.880
Sleeping and your own fucking bed is underrated.

879
00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:28.470
Having access to your entire wardrobe is underrated.

880
00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:33.840
Being able to rub one out and not have to put a please don't clean the room now

881
00:55:33.841 --> 00:55:37.890
sign on your door.
That's also,

882
00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:39.570
that's also overrated.

883
00:55:42.270 --> 00:55:46.170
Remembering what the fuck you were talking about.
That's overrated.
Hey,

884
00:55:46.171 --> 00:55:47.250
does anybody have like a,

885
00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:52.260
a help your memory like brain game that I can start playing?

886
00:55:52.650 --> 00:55:55.260
Cause I'm starting to really believe that your brain is a muscle because I am

887
00:55:55.261 --> 00:56:00.261
really losing my train of thought at a disturbing amount every single day now.

888
00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:03.690
And I was just reading this story about,
uh,

889
00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:07.230
you know that [inaudible] asked her lady who passed away in New York,

890
00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:11.070
the aster family Astor place and all that type of shit.
She,

891
00:56:11.310 --> 00:56:14.700
I guess she got Alzheimer's and it sounded like a fucking horrific way to go.

892
00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:17.970
So I started thinking like,
well what if I start playing Pictionary?

893
00:56:18.450 --> 00:56:21.600
What if I go to toys r us and I buy that game that's supposed to help kids

894
00:56:21.601 --> 00:56:25.840
memories,
you know,
we got the cards,
you know,
and you turn one over,

895
00:56:25.841 --> 00:56:30.410
it's an owl and you try to find the other aisle and then you try it and it's an

896
00:56:30.410 --> 00:56:34.570
hour and then it's a basset hound and you're like,
fuck,
you know,

897
00:56:34.690 --> 00:56:38.560
and then your parents go,
I knew you weren't going to amount to shit.
Right.

898
00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:40.900
I remember that game.
Isn't there?

899
00:56:40.901 --> 00:56:43.780
Is there an adult version of that than anybody can recommend?
Because seriously,

900
00:56:43.781 --> 00:56:45.430
I really don't want to go out like that.

901
00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:49.420
Is anybody stay staying up on that whole aster family fucking thing where the

902
00:56:49.421 --> 00:56:53.350
guy evidently was the son as the,
as the,
uh,

903
00:56:53.351 --> 00:56:58.270
the older aster lady went into her senile years.
He just started,
you know,

904
00:56:58.890 --> 00:57:03.820
rewriting or will.
So he get all the cash and that's a weird fucking family.

905
00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:09.190
The Astors,
it's like the whole,
that lady,

906
00:57:09.570 --> 00:57:11.230
the lady who just died a couple years ago,

907
00:57:11.231 --> 00:57:13.840
she gave away like $200 million to charity.

908
00:57:14.050 --> 00:57:15.970
But if you look at how they got their shit,

909
00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:21.180
they was slumlords like a century worth of people died of tuberculosis in their

910
00:57:21.371 --> 00:57:22.510
fucking damp,

911
00:57:22.690 --> 00:57:26.620
dark fucking walk in closet apartments that they had.

912
00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:30.160
And then after a while they felt guilty.
So they started giving it away.

913
00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:34.970
But you know what?
I'm on to your game.
They,

914
00:57:35.150 --> 00:57:40.150
to tell you my theory about statues,
unless you're like an artist,
an entertainer,

915
00:57:40.151 --> 00:57:44.740
a sports person or whatever,
you know,
if this has statue of you,

916
00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:50.200
unless you're,
you're one of those kinds of people,
you did something fucked up,

917
00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:55.420
you know?
Does that make any sense to you?

918
00:57:56.170 --> 00:57:59.260
Like Stevie Ray Vaughn got a statue,
right?
What did he do?
He made albums.

919
00:57:59.261 --> 00:58:02.380
He played guitar.
I'm sure you heard some people around him at some point,

920
00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:03.161
you know,

921
00:58:03.161 --> 00:58:07.060
swung his guitar around the strap broke and he fucking smash some chicken.

922
00:58:07.061 --> 00:58:11.710
The teeth.
Maybe that happened,
you know,
but I'm just saying generally speaking,

923
00:58:11.711 --> 00:58:14.890
he didn't hurt anybody.
But then you'll get these other guys,
you're like,

924
00:58:14.891 --> 00:58:19.060
who the fuck is that guy?
Anytime I'll get this,
here's a,
here's a fun exercise.

925
00:58:19.061 --> 00:58:21.100
Next time you walk by a statue,
when you're looking at him like,

926
00:58:21.101 --> 00:58:22.360
who the fuck is that guy?

927
00:58:23.020 --> 00:58:28.020
Go on the internet and just Google whatever his name is and then write a robber

928
00:58:28.541 --> 00:58:33.541
baron after it or some sort of just right corrupt and Google it and watch all

929
00:58:34.211 --> 00:58:38.580
the fucking articles you find granted.
You know you're not really you,
you know,

930
00:58:38.581 --> 00:58:42.130
you know,
I never really googled that.
You know the same name and great guy.

931
00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:44.350
I never do that either because I just get a thought in my head.

932
00:58:44.530 --> 00:58:46.090
That's what a lot of people do when they go on the Internet.

933
00:58:46.210 --> 00:58:49.600
You have a thought in your head what you fucking think somebody is or what the

934
00:58:49.601 --> 00:58:53.350
fuck's going on and then you just Google shit in the way you Google it.

935
00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:56.860
It's so everyone will support you.
You know?

936
00:58:57.030 --> 00:58:59.290
It's like if you think someone's an asshole,
you're like,

937
00:58:59.291 --> 00:59:01.840
you know Brian Jones do fish.

938
00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:05.470
And then you Google and then all these artists don't come up and then you go,

939
00:59:05.471 --> 00:59:09.520
there you go.
Look at all the articles.
Right.
See He is a Douche.

940
00:59:12.010 --> 00:59:13.430
You know he's supposed to just Google.

941
00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:16.510
The guy's name and then then peace through them.
I never do that.

942
00:59:16.511 --> 00:59:20.950
I'm actually yelling at myself right now.
You guys want to hear a story?
Um,

943
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:23.060
<v 6>Oh,
before I get into that,</v>

944
00:59:23.061 --> 00:59:25.680
I gotta I gotta I gotta rectify something I said last week,
you know,

945
00:59:25.681 --> 00:59:28.760
I was talking about how Pontiac went out of business and I was saying the Trans

946
00:59:28.761 --> 00:59:33.080
am was like their best car.
And I was like,
what else did they have after that?

947
00:59:33.081 --> 00:59:37.640
It goes to the sunburn.
Then the Pontiac t 1000,
there's a major drop off.
I,

948
00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:39.680
uh,
I stand corrected.

949
00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:43.400
Later on that day I was laying in bed and I actually sat up,
right?

950
00:59:43.401 --> 00:59:48.020
And I was like,
how the fuck did I forget the Pontiac Gto?
You know,

951
00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:51.440
the Bonneville,
they had a lot of good cars.

952
00:59:53.230 --> 00:59:58.100
It's not the Aztec.
I'm looking right now,
the top 10
Pontiac's of all time.

953
00:59:58.101 --> 01:00:00.020
And they actually put the Pontiac Aztec.

954
01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:04.160
If that wasn't the ugliest fucking vehicle other than the Chevy Lumina,

955
01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:08.640
remember that thing?
Chevy fucking Illumina.
All right,

956
01:00:08.641 --> 01:00:10.910
so here's something for you guys.
You want to,
you want to look,

957
01:00:10.911 --> 01:00:12.560
I'm really into cars and that type of shit.

958
01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:16.220
If you want to see one of the most fucked up looking vehicles of all time,

959
01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:21.890
Google this,
I'm not even asking you.
I'm telling you Google this,

960
01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:25.470
the a GMC future liner.

961
01:00:26.690 --> 01:00:30.800
All right?
And however you spell it,
you're going to be able to find it.
Um,

962
01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:35.350
this was something that they made in like the 1940s.
They,

963
01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:38.780
this thing called the parade of progress is a great youtube video.

964
01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:43.280
That's something else.
You can Google the parade of progress.
And they had these,

965
01:00:43.281 --> 01:00:45.050
I can't even explain what they are.

966
01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:48.740
It'd be like picture of a toaster eight a Winnebago.

967
01:00:49.790 --> 01:00:52.670
That's what this fucking thing looks like.
Are you looking it up right now?

968
01:00:52.671 --> 01:00:54.140
Yet your desk,
you sit there,

969
01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:56.630
your cubicle pretending like you're doing your real work.

970
01:00:57.460 --> 01:00:58.430
You got to look this thing up.

971
01:00:58.430 --> 01:01:02.150
I apologize to people on planes right now or if you're on a treadmill,

972
01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:04.470
but you gotta look this fucking thing up.
I want to,

973
01:01:04.471 --> 01:01:07.700
I never even heard of these things.
And I was watching one of those auto shows,

974
01:01:08.090 --> 01:01:11.690
you know,
all those rich cops go out and they spent $2 million in a Mustang.

975
01:01:11.691 --> 01:01:14.290
So now I can't buy one.
Well this,
uh,

976
01:01:14.430 --> 01:01:15.830
they actually more than a couple hundred thousand,

977
01:01:15.831 --> 01:01:20.180
but this thing actually went for like a million dollars,
maybe even more.
Um,

978
01:01:21.770 --> 01:01:25.070
it actually to look at it from the side,
it looks like it has four wheels,

979
01:01:25.071 --> 01:01:28.280
but each wheel is doubled.
You know,
like those duly pickups.

980
01:01:28.490 --> 01:01:32.540
So it actually has eight wheels.
And like I said,
it literally looks like a,

981
01:01:34.070 --> 01:01:36.950
the jolly green giant had a toaster with wheels on it.

982
01:01:36.951 --> 01:01:41.870
This is what the fuck that thing would look like.
But um,
I don't think,

983
01:01:41.871 --> 01:01:46.400
I think 99% of of Americans have never seen this thing.

984
01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:49.850
And if you ever had one of those and just drove it down the fucking street,

985
01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:53.990
a bunch of people would look at you and isn't that,

986
01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:55.610
isn't that what we're all asking for?

987
01:01:55.940 --> 01:01:58.880
Everyone's going to look in your direction and be like,
wow,
who's that guy?

988
01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:03.920
Is he a rebel?
Um,
all right.
I gotta read this fucked up email before.

989
01:02:03.921 --> 01:02:06.440
This isn't even the podcast.
This is just me bullshitting around here.

990
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:09.500
Let me get into his,
a story somebody said to me,

991
01:02:10.370 --> 01:02:13.970
which brings up an interesting debate here.
Uh,
I says,
hey bill,

992
01:02:13.971 --> 01:02:15.080
my name is so and so.

993
01:02:15.081 --> 01:02:17.150
I'm just writing to let you know you're my favorite comedian.

994
01:02:17.151 --> 01:02:20.130
I really can relate to everything you say.
Not sure if that's good or bad.

995
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Ello fucking l m I bought tickets to see you on Friday at Caroline's in New

996
01:02:26.790 --> 01:02:31.470
York.
I spent over $200 on tickets about a month before so that me and my friends

997
01:02:31.471 --> 01:02:34.500
could go and have a grand old time.
Well,
Lo and behold,

998
01:02:34.530 --> 01:02:36.510
of course the shit only happens to me.

999
01:02:36.930 --> 01:02:40.080
We get on the train two hours before you go on,

1000
01:02:40.081 --> 01:02:43.680
so we can get there plenty of time and watch the show.
But Lo and behold,

1001
01:02:43.681 --> 01:02:44.514
what happens?

1002
01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:49.350
Some fucking lady decided that she was going to end her life and get hit by the

1003
01:02:49.351 --> 01:02:51.570
train in front of mine.

1004
01:02:52.410 --> 01:02:56.640
I know it's a sad thing and I should feel bad,
but fuck that.

1005
01:02:57.330 --> 01:03:01.560
I was like,
really,
lady,
are you serious of all the fucking trains?

1006
01:03:01.650 --> 01:03:06.570
It had to be the one that I was on that got delayed two hours.
I'm like,
fuck,

1007
01:03:06.571 --> 01:03:08.490
if you want to kill yourself because you know,

1008
01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:12.720
cause you're miserable with your life,
go shoot yourself a jump off a bridge.

1009
01:03:12.721 --> 01:03:16.500
But don't make us all suffer.
So anyways,
long story short,

1010
01:03:16.501 --> 01:03:19.110
I only got to see the last 30 minutes you show,
which was great,

1011
01:03:19.111 --> 01:03:21.120
but I was disappointed that we couldn't see the whole thing.

1012
01:03:21.690 --> 01:03:24.960
I'm not sure when you'll be in New York again.
I'm sure your website,

1013
01:03:25.050 --> 01:03:27.810
we'll post a,
we'll post the date whenever it will be.

1014
01:03:28.110 --> 01:03:30.360
While you're probably wondering why the fuck I'm writing you,

1015
01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:33.540
while I have to vent to someone that's on my level of understanding,

1016
01:03:33.930 --> 01:03:37.200
understanding people's
Suck Jesus Christ.

1017
01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:40.640
While I'm sorry.
Uh,
sorry to hear that.
You know,
you should've,

1018
01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:44.030
you should've told me that story.
You know,
I would have fucking,

1019
01:03:44.050 --> 01:03:45.780
I would have tossed you a DVD at the end,

1020
01:03:45.781 --> 01:03:49.680
would have given you something for your Theora,
your troubles,
um,

1021
01:03:49.681 --> 01:03:52.110
yet you bring up a good point.
You know,
if you're going to kill yourself,

1022
01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:55.050
it's bad enough.
You're going to make everyone around you suffer.
Buddy.
I'm me.

1023
01:03:55.051 --> 01:03:57.990
Complete strangers.
Suffer the lay there at night.
Have Fun

1024
01:03:59.550 --> 01:04:02.610
on a fucking let it go.
Jesus Christ.
I could tell you right now,
uh,

1025
01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:06.630
there is no way to do a thorough clean up after somebody jumps in front of a

1026
01:04:06.631 --> 01:04:09.690
fucking train.
There's no fucking way you're getting every piece.

1027
01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:13.410
You know what I mean?
There's no way.
If you don't believe me,

1028
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:17.400
why don't you go get a flank steak and stick and mad in it and light it off in

1029
01:04:17.401 --> 01:04:18.234
your kitchen,

1030
01:04:18.270 --> 01:04:22.830
clean it up the best of your ability and I guarantee you six months from now

1031
01:04:23.070 --> 01:04:27.740
you're going to be fine and Shit in the curtains.
You know,
there's just,
uh,

1032
01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:32.180
and yeah,
for those of you who didn't wonder,
this is a very educational podcasts.

1033
01:04:32.181 --> 01:04:34.470
That's,
that's what like jumping in front of a train is,

1034
01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:39.420
that's exactly what it's like lighting off an MIT in a flank.
Steak in a kitchen.

1035
01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:41.550
All right,
so right now,

1036
01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:44.700
even if you press stop and you never listen to the rest of this,

1037
01:04:44.910 --> 01:04:48.570
you actually fucking learned something.
All right,
so here we go.

1038
01:04:48.571 --> 01:04:52.740
This is the podcast.
This is what the fuck I do.
I do it every single Monday.

1039
01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:56.520
People send me questions and a information.

1040
01:04:56.550 --> 01:05:01.020
We have a list of stuff that's overrated and underrated.
Uh,

1041
01:05:01.050 --> 01:05:04.890
people send me stories about revenge and all that type of shit.

1042
01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:10.050
Have I really been talking for fucking 20 minutes?
Is that true?

1043
01:05:11.550 --> 01:05:15.900
Did I fuck up again?
You know what?
There's no way for me to know as shit.

1044
01:05:15.901 --> 01:05:19.210
I have to hit stop.
Fuck,
fuck.

1045
01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:26.040
All right,
so I fucked up.
You know,
I thought I,
uh,

1046
01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:28.540
Jeez.
I can't even tell you what the fuck I thought.
I can't even explain it.

1047
01:05:28.541 --> 01:05:31.000
I thought,
I thought it was only three minutes into the podcast.

1048
01:05:31.001 --> 01:05:33.610
I looked down and sit in 19 minutes and I thought I fucked up.

1049
01:05:33.611 --> 01:05:37.570
I thought I started the podcast at the end of another fucked up podcasts and

1050
01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:40.960
turned out I didn't.
So there's just going to be two tracks this week,

1051
01:05:40.961 --> 01:05:45.010
which a lot of UX she should probably enjoy on some level because a number of

1052
01:05:45.011 --> 01:05:48.450
you give me shit about how big my files are moved.

1053
01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:53.470
The two too long to download mean well,
why don't you upload,
uh,
upload,

1054
01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:55.960
upgrade your fucking technology and what do you want from me?

1055
01:05:57.400 --> 01:06:01.120
I don't know how to do this shit.
Stop giving me shit.
All right.
Fucking people.

1056
01:06:01.121 --> 01:06:03.820
Every week.
People seem to like last week when I was all hung over,

1057
01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:06.130
so a lot of people said it wasn't my best podcasts of all time,

1058
01:06:06.310 --> 01:06:09.250
but there was a couple of people who actually went out of their way to tell me

1059
01:06:09.251 --> 01:06:11.800
that they thought that it sucked,
you know,

1060
01:06:13.390 --> 01:06:17.710
don't do anymore hung over podcast.
I can add that.

1061
01:06:17.711 --> 01:06:20.260
That one kind of thought women really didn't like it.

1062
01:06:20.261 --> 01:06:22.870
That I say something really mean about women because the only ones who didn't

1063
01:06:22.871 --> 01:06:27.220
like it were women.
You know,
I don't know if you have drunk boyfriends,
you know,

1064
01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:32.410
or spouses.
He was such a swell guy.
And then after we got married,

1065
01:06:32.650 --> 01:06:36.490
everything was going,
he was going great.
And then one day I work,

1066
01:06:36.491 --> 01:06:40.240
he hurt his back and that he started taking pain pills.

1067
01:06:40.241 --> 01:06:44.610
And then you had an episode of intervention,
you know.

1068
01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:48.520
So is that what it reminded you of?
I wasn't trying to piss anyone off.
All right.

1069
01:06:49.150 --> 01:06:53.440
Um,
so anyways,
having survived the epidemic in New York City,

1070
01:06:53.441 --> 01:06:55.540
the swine flu epidemic,

1071
01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:59.800
I was so sick of them using the words epidemic and pandemic,

1072
01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:03.580
you know,
I was like,
what the fuck is the difference?

1073
01:07:03.581 --> 01:07:07.330
So basically an epidemic is when you,
I guess it's some sort of whatever,

1074
01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:10.720
it's some sort of disease or some shit,
but it's confined.

1075
01:07:10.750 --> 01:07:14.830
It's confined to one country I guess.
And a pandemic is global,

1076
01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:20.380
you know,
and if it's just in an area,
in a country that's a breakout,

1077
01:07:20.890 --> 01:07:24.490
but the definition of an epidemic every evidently what makes something an

1078
01:07:24.491 --> 01:07:28.000
epidemic according to Wikipedia,
I'm saving you guys time.

1079
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.290
You don't have to look it up and read it.

1080
01:07:30.070 --> 01:07:35.020
Cause that's where I get it from an epidemic is basically,
uh,

1081
01:07:35.830 --> 01:07:39.560
it basically says defining an epidemic can be subjective.
Um,

1082
01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:45.100
depending in part on what is expected and epidemic may be rustic,

1083
01:07:45.101 --> 01:07:48.940
restricted to one local locale and outbreak like I just said,

1084
01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:53.740
a more general and epidemic or even global pandemic.
Um,

1085
01:07:54.130 --> 01:07:57.310
because it is based on what is expected or thought normal.

1086
01:07:57.370 --> 01:08:02.350
A few cases of a very rare disease,
like rabies may be classified as an epidemic,

1087
01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:07.560
while many cases of the common common diseases like the common cold would not,

1088
01:08:07.930 --> 01:08:11.200
you know what I mean?
So basically if you know,

1089
01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:16.070
five people had rabies out here in la,
that would be considered an epidemic

1090
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:19.970
<v 5>because that's five more than they expected.
Uh,</v>

1091
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:24.980
but if everybody had the fucking ass flu,
you know,
they'd be like,

1092
01:08:24.981 --> 01:08:27.980
well,
you know,
we told them to wear condoms.
Um,
all right,

1093
01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:33.830
let's get to the a overrated underrated here for this week.
Uh,
overrated.

1094
01:08:33.831 --> 01:08:35.600
This guy sends in,
he said,

1095
01:08:35.601 --> 01:08:39.170
a red sox sweeping the Yankees in April.

1096
01:08:39.770 --> 01:08:44.540
I thought that that was hilarious because not only is that true,

1097
01:08:44.541 --> 01:08:45.800
it is just April,

1098
01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:50.810
but what I really found funny is that if the Yankee swept the red sox,

1099
01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:55.010
that dude would not think that it was overrated.
He would be like,
you see,

1100
01:08:55.070 --> 01:08:58.820
we fucking all you guys fucking Boston goes fucking shock.

1101
01:08:58.821 --> 01:09:02.000
Everything closes by one's fucking city.
So fucking lame.

1102
01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:06.140
Can't even get a fucking slash um,

1103
01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:09.680
I don't think the red sox sweeping the Yankees and April is overrated.

1104
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.140
You know,
you know,

1105
01:09:12.141 --> 01:09:16.070
I think it's overrated spending $420 million on three fucking guys.

1106
01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:18.620
What do think about that?
That's fucking overrated.

1107
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:24.430
Spending $200 million a year to not win the world series is overrated.

1108
01:09:26.420 --> 01:09:29.840
I don't understand.
Why don't they Yankees trust their farm system?
Oh,

1109
01:09:29.841 --> 01:09:33.440
I know why they don't trust them because all their farm system has ever given

1110
01:09:33.441 --> 01:09:38.330
them is Lou Gehrig.
Joe Dimaggio,
Mickey Mantle,

1111
01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:43.970
Derek Jeter,
Andy Pettitte,
Bernie Williams,

1112
01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:46.430
Jorge Posada.
Why the fuck would you,

1113
01:09:46.431 --> 01:09:51.431
why would you wait around to build a team when you can go out and spend hundreds

1114
01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:56.970
of millions of dollars on shitheads?
There,

1115
01:09:57.540 --> 01:09:59.720
can you fuck them?
They're not going to win it again this year.

1116
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:02.150
Fucking unbelievable.

1117
01:10:02.151 --> 01:10:04.490
I was sitting there going to foreign to $20 million and three guys.

1118
01:10:04.491 --> 01:10:08.310
There's no fucking way,
you know,
and to share.

1119
01:10:08.350 --> 01:10:11.240
It was on the angels last year.
I mean,
that guy,
he looked like a beast.

1120
01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:17.210
I don't know.
I actually went to Yankee stadium on a Sunday,
new Yankee stadium,

1121
01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:21.890
and I gotta admit I really had a lot of mixed emotions.
Uh,

1122
01:10:21.891 --> 01:10:26.060
as I,
as I got out there,
I got off and I looked at old Yankee stadium.
I'm like,

1123
01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:30.980
that's Yankee stadium.
You know,
I don't know.
I'm a sentimental jackass.

1124
01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:33.920
I'm into the history,
you know,
I loved going into that place.

1125
01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:37.550
That fucking place was awesome.
You know,

1126
01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:41.480
even though so many horrific things happen to the red sox there,
I mean,
Jesus,

1127
01:10:41.481 --> 01:10:45.290
if you have any sort of a sports fan,
he got it.
You got to respect that.

1128
01:10:45.291 --> 01:10:49.610
That's the,
uh,
that's the number one stadium and all four sports,
without a doubt.

1129
01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:51.650
26 fucking championships.

1130
01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:56.450
Not even those fucking sissies up in Montreal can say that,

1131
01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:01.820
you know,
hey,
what do you think?
Did I ask you guys this question?

1132
01:11:01.821 --> 01:11:05.030
What do you think's the most overrated team with like,

1133
01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:08.210
like as far as the has like the most amount of championships.

1134
01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:10.220
I was talking to this with a,
with a guy the other day.

1135
01:11:10.221 --> 01:11:13.980
Like do you ever notice like in any sort of league there's always a,

1136
01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:15.690
<v 6>there's always one team in the,</v>

1137
01:11:15.691 --> 01:11:20.691
in the inception of a league that always goes on a run in the beginning and they

1138
01:11:21.091 --> 01:11:22.530
go on such a run that,
you know,

1139
01:11:22.531 --> 01:11:26.640
basically for the most part it's going to take another century to catch up with

1140
01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:31.290
them if you even can,
you know?
Do you know what I'm saying?

1141
01:11:31.740 --> 01:11:35.610
Like look at the South Texas Celtics went on that run in the 60s it's like,

1142
01:11:35.690 --> 01:11:38.270
come on man,
do you,
you see what people look like?
They,
they,
they,

1143
01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:43.140
they barely will.
Like the league just started,
you know what I mean?
I mean,

1144
01:11:43.141 --> 01:11:45.030
you look at that shit the way they play.
Like,
Gee,

1145
01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:48.270
I think I could have fucking made the final cut,
you know?

1146
01:11:48.630 --> 01:11:51.000
And then he got the Yankees,
they,
they one way back,

1147
01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:54.840
a whole bunch back in the three stooges era.
But,
uh,

1148
01:11:54.841 --> 01:11:56.670
I really don't disrespect the baseball one.

1149
01:11:56.850 --> 01:11:59.550
What's once they let black people and Latinos in and that type of shit,

1150
01:11:59.551 --> 01:12:02.840
the Yankees still fucking dominated.
But,
uh,
I,

1151
01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:07.860
I think I might have to go with the Canadians just for the simple fact that

1152
01:12:08.071 --> 01:12:11.400
there were only six teams,
you know what I mean?

1153
01:12:12.630 --> 01:12:14.160
So I think it's kind of easy,

1154
01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:19.460
much easier to go on a run and hockey than it was in basketball or even baseball

1155
01:12:19.690 --> 01:12:24.320
cause bay.
I think baseball had like,
uh,
how many teams or they have,
I,
Jesus,

1156
01:12:24.330 --> 01:12:26.400
I probably should have looked this up.
I used to know this shit.

1157
01:12:26.401 --> 01:12:31.080
I think they had about fit 14,
16 and I was like,
yeah,
maybe 12 teams.

1158
01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:34.310
Um,
but here's another thing too,
back in the day when,

1159
01:12:34.311 --> 01:12:37.500
when you went to the world and if you won the division that was winning the

1160
01:12:37.501 --> 01:12:41.400
pennant,
you know,
and then you just immediately went to the world series.

1161
01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:45.510
There wasn't fucking around of playoffs before the world series for a while

1162
01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:50.160
until they got past a certain amount of teams and uh,
you know,

1163
01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:51.990
when to stay on the copy had to win eight games.

1164
01:12:51.991 --> 01:12:54.540
That's a whole nother fucking deal.
You know what I mean?
Like nowadays,

1165
01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:57.000
like all these,
all these teams,

1166
01:12:57.001 --> 01:13:00.540
there's like 30 teams in every single fucking league now.

1167
01:13:00.750 --> 01:13:04.530
So now you got a one in 30 chance as opposed to back in the day,
look in hockey,

1168
01:13:04.650 --> 01:13:07.860
you had a one in six chance of winning the cup and it's something else.

1169
01:13:07.870 --> 01:13:08.703
I didn't notice either.

1170
01:13:08.850 --> 01:13:12.030
The amount that the Toronto may believe hung with the Canadians right up til

1171
01:13:12.031 --> 01:13:14.490
1967 they were like neck and neck.

1172
01:13:14.970 --> 01:13:18.060
They will like 15 Stanley cups.
Verse 13

1173
01:13:19.950 --> 01:13:22.140
fucking Toronto was right there,
man.
And then they just,

1174
01:13:22.141 --> 01:13:26.190
they just shit the bed my whole life.
Then I was born,

1175
01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:31.860
I think I'm cursing the Toronto Maple leafs.
Um,
put our branches.

1176
01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:33.780
I'm,
you know what,
before the [inaudible] fans get pissed,

1177
01:13:33.781 --> 01:13:35.850
I'm just breaking your balls because I know you guys.

1178
01:13:35.851 --> 01:13:39.540
You won like what'd you went?
Seven cups in the 70s.
Is that what you did?

1179
01:13:39.570 --> 01:13:42.970
I think you did.
And that was with the expansion 12th.
But even that was bullshit.

1180
01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:45.990
Cause then they took the expansion six and they just put them in their own

1181
01:13:45.991 --> 01:13:49.470
fucking division.
So then all you had to do was just a,

1182
01:13:49.471 --> 01:13:53.490
when the other division and then you went up against like the fucking Saint

1183
01:13:53.490 --> 01:13:57.750
Louis Blues like we did.
I like the north star is Assam Shit.
All right.

1184
01:13:57.751 --> 01:14:00.570
That last three minutes.
Where was for the fucking sports nerds?
All right,

1185
01:14:00.571 --> 01:14:01.890
let me move on here.
Oh,
I didn't say so.

1186
01:14:01.891 --> 01:14:06.860
I wanted to new Yankee Stadium and I got to admit like,
I don't know man.
I,

1187
01:14:06.861 --> 01:14:11.380
I w I got to,
it was weird because you will,

1188
01:14:11.381 --> 01:14:16.090
looking at the Yankees,
I felt like I was at legends field.
You know,

1189
01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:19.750
I was like,
those are the New York Yankees.
But this is not their house.

1190
01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:25.420
I don't feel,
I don't feel the history,
you know.
Um,

1191
01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:26.261
and I also got admit,

1192
01:14:26.261 --> 01:14:29.050
it kind of looked like every other fucking stadium except it had that cool

1193
01:14:29.051 --> 01:14:32.650
facade.
The facade is the shit outside of the stadium is the ship.

1194
01:14:32.651 --> 01:14:36.520
And inside it just Kinda was like fucking voice cracks inside,

1195
01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:41.050
inside the stadium.
It just kind of looked like a,
I dunno,

1196
01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:44.830
I think I might like pac bell a little better.
I'll have to go again.

1197
01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:48.640
You know what's so amazing?
Shit has to happen there for that's,
that's the same,

1198
01:14:48.641 --> 01:14:49.690
all of those fucking things.

1199
01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:53.350
I can just go to Shea stadium and even after the red sox won it,

1200
01:14:53.410 --> 01:14:55.210
I would still look at that spot where the boat,

1201
01:14:55.211 --> 01:14:58.990
where the ball went through Buckner's legs.
Except after we won it,
then it would,

1202
01:14:59.020 --> 01:15:03.850
I then I also saw the humor in it,
but until then,
until that point,
uh,
I didn't.

1203
01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:05.140
All right.
Moving on here.
All right.

1204
01:15:05.141 --> 01:15:09.670
The other thing that people say is a overrated,
uh,

1205
01:15:09.671 --> 01:15:13.780
the peoples,
peoples,
Kentucky Derby Pics.

1206
01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:19.620
I hate all these people who basically only watched three horse races a year and

1207
01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:23.170
they only watch three horse races a year.
Yet they,
they give me,

1208
01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:25.930
they come up to me and they give you a g,
you know,
something that half,

1209
01:15:25.931 --> 01:15:28.030
this isn't fucking me.
You know what?

1210
01:15:28.031 --> 01:15:31.690
I was actually going to blame the guy fucking route there,
but I can't,
you know,

1211
01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:34.150
that's actually how I've read it.
All right,
let me,
let me start over again.

1212
01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:36.190
People's Kentucky Derby Pics.

1213
01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:41.440
I hated how all these people who basically only watched three races a year yet

1214
01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:45.010
yet.
No,
you did fuck up yet.

1215
01:15:45.011 --> 01:15:50.011
They give you their derby picks and they say shit like it's going to be a sloppy

1216
01:15:51.611 --> 01:15:56.320
track today.
This horse thrives on a sloppy track.
Does he?

1217
01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:00.130
You know what?
That was such a great fucking point and I really butchered that.

1218
01:16:00.810 --> 01:16:03.910
Yeah,
I know.
Everybody starts acting like they're fucking Jack Klugman.
You know,

1219
01:16:04.030 --> 01:16:08.230
with a rolled up program,
nobody gives a fuck about horse racing.
You know,

1220
01:16:08.231 --> 01:16:11.860
back in the day,
horse racing and boxing used to be the number one sports.

1221
01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:16.870
Granted there was no football,
baseball and hockey,
basketball,

1222
01:16:16.871 --> 01:16:18.550
none of that shit was around then.

1223
01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:20.440
One was around and took a while for it to take over.

1224
01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:24.460
This is just all going to be sports this week.
Uh,
pay per view.

1225
01:16:24.461 --> 01:16:28.180
Boxing matches are overrated.
They're never worth the money.

1226
01:16:28.420 --> 01:16:29.950
It's just all about the marketing.

1227
01:16:29.951 --> 01:16:32.890
I'm glad I didn't spend $50 on the hat and park.

1228
01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:36.820
Was it parky of Packeo fight because a,

1229
01:16:36.821 --> 01:16:39.400
it was on youtube for free about two hours later.

1230
01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:43.790
Although I will buy a PA EEO or Packeo have you say his name May.

1231
01:16:44.140 --> 01:16:48.940
Whether if that happens.
Well that's good to know,
sir.
I'm underrated.

1232
01:16:49.180 --> 01:16:51.850
Uh,
how gay those frilly boxing trunks,

1233
01:16:51.851 --> 01:16:56.630
some fighters where I think it's,
I think it's,

1234
01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:59.320
see this is the shit.
I can't read it cause it's too fucking small and going on.

1235
01:16:59.350 --> 01:17:01.810
I'm getting old here.
I think it's health hysterical.

1236
01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:06.610
When some fighters come out wearing some something Liberace would wear and then

1237
01:17:06.611 --> 01:17:11.510
they just get the shit beat out of them.
This guy really wrote some funny shit.

1238
01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:15.230
I'm just butchering it.
I guess I could never be a fucking newscaster.

1239
01:17:15.530 --> 01:17:19.910
Let me try that again.
Okay.
Underrated.
How gay those frilly boxing trunks.

1240
01:17:19.911 --> 01:17:23.240
Some fighters were C,
that's a fragment.

1241
01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:25.040
That's what trips me up.

1242
01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:29.240
She'd say how gay some of those frilly boxing trunks are that some of the

1243
01:17:29.241 --> 01:17:30.074
fighters were.

1244
01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:34.430
I think it's hysterical when when a fighter comes out wearing something that

1245
01:17:34.431 --> 01:17:38.240
only Liberace would wear and then he goes on to get the shit kicked out of them.

1246
01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:41.870
Say they,
that's what I'll do.
I'll get the gist of it.
I'll just paraphrase.

1247
01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:47.320
Underrated a massages with happy endings for 100 bucks.

1248
01:17:47.361 --> 01:17:51.560
You get a 60 minute massage that ends with an agent and Asian chick beating you

1249
01:17:51.561 --> 01:17:55.490
off and the top it off at the end for no extra charge.

1250
01:17:55.491 --> 01:17:58.940
She'll give you a table shower,
which is basically a bath.

1251
01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:01.580
It's how God must get a hand job.

1252
01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:06.950
Dude,
you write really funny shit.
I mean,

1253
01:18:06.951 --> 01:18:09.440
I'm not telling you to go out there and you might,
you might get a future.

1254
01:18:09.441 --> 01:18:14.120
This son,
there's Sonny boy.
Hey,
getting back to the,
uh,
the,
uh,

1255
01:18:14.630 --> 01:18:15.950
the swine flu shit.

1256
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:19.700
There was a bunch of people walking around New York with those mass on those

1257
01:18:19.701 --> 01:18:22.370
little surgical masks.
How fucking hilarious is that?

1258
01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:28.080
It's an airborne virus.
I don't understand the thought process key.

1259
01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:31.630
You're breathing through the mass.
What is it?
What is,
well,

1260
01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:33.650
actually you can get through.
We're not to pig virus.

1261
01:18:33.660 --> 01:18:37.650
You oxygen is just a wee bit smaller than the pig virus.
Pick various,

1262
01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:42.230
just hits the front of the mask and then that's it.
I was on my flight today,

1263
01:18:42.231 --> 01:18:44.390
flying out here from New York City.
And,
uh,

1264
01:18:44.420 --> 01:18:49.310
this is sort of weird and I want to know from my,
uh,
my Asian constituents,

1265
01:18:49.311 --> 01:18:51.770
whatever the fucking word is.
Um,

1266
01:18:52.670 --> 01:18:56.210
there was about six people on the plane who were all wearing those surgical

1267
01:18:56.211 --> 01:18:56.631
masks.

1268
01:18:56.631 --> 01:19:01.280
Like they were going to amputate somebody's leg during the civil war or doing a

1269
01:19:01.281 --> 01:19:04.940
fucking guest star on Mash.
They were wearing,
and they were all Asian.

1270
01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:08.300
Only the agents were wearing those.
And what does that from,

1271
01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:12.620
was that because they had to live through SARS and,

1272
01:19:12.621 --> 01:19:15.110
and they made it by the grace of God.

1273
01:19:15.111 --> 01:19:19.400
But there's some for some reason like attributing the,
uh,
the mass to it.

1274
01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:22.700
Does anybody know?
Does anybody know out there?
Anybody?

1275
01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:26.540
Anybody out there in podcast land?
All right,
I have to do the fucking math here,

1276
01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:30.080
um,
to 29 minutes.
Not to go too long.
All right.
By the way,
a bill,

1277
01:19:30.081 --> 01:19:32.540
congratulations on the Celtics feeding the bowls,

1278
01:19:32.780 --> 01:19:35.390
but I want to know how you feel about Derrick rose.

1279
01:19:35.391 --> 01:19:40.391
Just basically bitch slapping Brian Scalabrine in game seven with that nasty ass

1280
01:19:42.321 --> 01:19:47.060
block.
Uh,
considering we won the series,
I think I feel pretty fine about it.

1281
01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:50.300
I actually did a show that night and I miss game seven.
But,
uh,

1282
01:19:50.301 --> 01:19:54.560
you guys are going to be great man.
Do you guys have a great young team?
And uh,

1283
01:19:55.130 --> 01:19:56.930
that
Guy Brian Scalabrine,

1284
01:19:56.931 --> 01:20:00.830
is that the fucking dude who looks like a Jesus Christ?

1285
01:20:00.831 --> 01:20:02.510
I always forget his fucking name.

1286
01:20:04.490 --> 01:20:06.110
What is that act as fucking name?

1287
01:20:06.111 --> 01:20:09.210
I always think Michael and then that screw on Matthew Modine.

1288
01:20:09.211 --> 01:20:10.450
I always think there's an m in it.

1289
01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:14.340
You know the guy he was in cop land,

1290
01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:20.040
he played the cop that had to disappear.
Uh,
what is his fucking mean?

1291
01:20:20.070 --> 01:20:24.990
That's exactly what that fucking dude looks like.
Ah,
Shit.

1292
01:20:25.710 --> 01:20:26.880
He would start in that.

1293
01:20:26.881 --> 01:20:31.881
That short lived sit-com the war at home actually at mid last at a season.

1294
01:20:31.921 --> 01:20:36.750
So that's actually successful these days away.
They cancel the fuck is his name.

1295
01:20:38.010 --> 01:20:41.220
I swear to God man.
I'm,
I'm like literally,
I'm losing my mind here

1296
01:20:43.830 --> 01:20:48.330
now we have to Google it.
I have to take time out of the fucking podcast.

1297
01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:53.310
The,
I have titled One Hand Cause I'm holding my Monday night football fucking

1298
01:20:53.311 --> 01:20:54.144
microphone here.

1299
01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:59.290
The war at home isn't Sankey Trinity where

1300
01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:03.113
Michael Rappaport,
there we go.

1301
01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:07.350
That's how he looks like he looks like Michael Rappaport.
I went to that Celtics,

1302
01:21:07.351 --> 01:21:11.520
Utah Jazz game out new tower.
Garnette got hurt and then Michael Rappaport Dude,

1303
01:21:11.521 --> 01:21:16.521
I watched him have one file in the first half and then he filed out in the third

1304
01:21:16.861 --> 01:21:19.380
quarter in the span.
I swear to God a four minutes.

1305
01:21:21.060 --> 01:21:24.030
I haven't seen any shit like that since Darryl Dawkins and I swear to God,

1306
01:21:24.031 --> 01:21:27.270
that's the end of the sports shit.
All right,
for the rest of you,
here we go.

1307
01:21:27.271 --> 01:21:31.680
We're going to move on here.
Uh,
moving onto the next part of the podcast.

1308
01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:34.560
Where the fuck am I?
Okay.
Somebody wants my advice.
Dear Bill,

1309
01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:38.390
I guess this falls under the,
I need advice column of the podcast.
Uh,

1310
01:21:38.430 --> 01:21:43.430
my 30th birthday is four days before you're 41st according to Wikipedia.

1311
01:21:44.250 --> 01:21:46.530
And I got to admit that I'm not looking forward to it.

1312
01:21:47.730 --> 01:21:52.170
I just feel like I'm getting old and it's sucks our work with this kid who's 23

1313
01:21:52.171 --> 01:21:54.000
and a one day a couple of weeks ago,

1314
01:21:54.001 --> 01:21:59.001
I caught myself in the middle of his speech about how lucky he is to be 23 and

1315
01:21:59.071 --> 01:22:03.180
how as a dude that's the perfect age,
23 years old,
all I,

1316
01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:08.360
all I can remember was at that age I had pussy falling out of my pockets and

1317
01:22:09.270 --> 01:22:11.460
let's just say things have dried up since then.

1318
01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:15.750
I promptly shut the hell up when I realized I was starting to sound like my dad,

1319
01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:20.440
but the kid was actually listening to me and asking questions about typical guy

1320
01:22:20.441 --> 01:22:21.060
shit.

1321
01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:26.060
So basically what I'm asking is what advice would you please offer to me about

1322
01:22:26.371 --> 01:22:30.420
relationships in life in general?
You know,

1323
01:22:30.421 --> 01:22:35.340
like if I knew what I knew,
what I know now,
kind of shit,
thanks in advance.

1324
01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:39.690
All right,
so obviously do,
do your relationships aren't working out.

1325
01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:42.750
So you've made the,
uh,

1326
01:22:43.830 --> 01:22:48.000
the brilliant decision to ask someone who's never made a relationship work.

1327
01:22:49.290 --> 01:22:53.910
Actually,
my relationship now is working,
right?
Um,
what are,

1328
01:22:53.940 --> 01:22:56.940
what is the advice?
Ah,
Jesus Christ.
Where the fuck do I

1329
01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:03.030
be selfish.
Here you go.
That's a good one.
I mean,
in your dating,

1330
01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:06.160
I'm literally tangled up in a fucking

1331
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:07.810
<v 5>wires here.
All right?</v>

1332
01:23:07.811 --> 01:23:12.550
That's what you gotta do you gotta be selfish and uh,
before you start date,

1333
01:23:12.551 --> 01:23:17.020
before you get back out,
just,
just make a list of shit that you want.
You know,

1334
01:23:17.021 --> 01:23:18.120
like practical shift.

1335
01:23:18.121 --> 01:23:22.810
Don't be like big [inaudible] fucking round as she's got to have nice toes.

1336
01:23:25.060 --> 01:23:28.510
Uh,
what else do you know?
What the fuck else is there?

1337
01:23:29.470 --> 01:23:34.030
Nice face.
You know,
Josh is nice but not a fucking war.

1338
01:23:34.060 --> 01:23:37.370
You know what I'm saying?
Um,
you've got to have some other shit too.
I don't know.

1339
01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:40.060
I mean,
I haven't been able to,
uh,
get married yet,

1340
01:23:40.061 --> 01:23:43.780
so that seems to be the pinnacle of what makes a healthy relationship for some

1341
01:23:43.781 --> 01:23:45.310
fucking reason.
But,
uh,

1342
01:23:45.311 --> 01:23:49.780
I did have a buddy of mine and who was a complete fucking maniac and he got

1343
01:23:49.781 --> 01:23:54.070
married and I asked him,
uh,
how we went about doing it and he just said he just

1344
01:23:55.810 --> 01:23:58.300
dumped all the fucking,
you know,
you know,

1345
01:23:58.301 --> 01:23:59.770
all those girls you got in your cell phone,

1346
01:23:59.771 --> 01:24:01.630
as much as you're saying that dried up,
you know,

1347
01:24:01.750 --> 01:24:04.180
you've got all those numbers in your cell phone,
you know those numbers,

1348
01:24:04.690 --> 01:24:08.860
those numbers.
You only call at one 30,
two o'clock in the morning.
You know,

1349
01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:13.840
those girls,
you got to sever ties with those girls because it's just,

1350
01:24:13.841 --> 01:24:17.470
it's too fucking easy.
It's like,
it's like,

1351
01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:21.280
it's like junk food.
If you've got it laying around in your house,

1352
01:24:21.281 --> 01:24:23.110
you're gonna become a,
you're just going to get,
it's going to eat it.

1353
01:24:23.111 --> 01:24:24.670
You open the bag,
eat the whole fucking thing,

1354
01:24:24.671 --> 01:24:27.310
and then you're sitting there going,
why the fuck did I do that?
You know?

1355
01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:31.860
Then I read a blog up,
I wrote a blog about that.
How whores are like the,

1356
01:24:31.861 --> 01:24:36.430
the human equivalent to a fucking bag of Doritos.
Um,

1357
01:24:36.460 --> 01:24:38.350
how the fuck is it?
19 minutes again,

1358
01:24:38.860 --> 01:24:43.540
what's 19 in 1938 there we go.
Okay,
I got to 12 minutes here.

1359
01:24:44.290 --> 01:24:47.020
Um,
yeah,
so just really figured out what the fuck you want.
And this guy,

1360
01:24:47.021 --> 01:24:48.610
one of the great things he did was he,

1361
01:24:48.970 --> 01:24:51.910
if he found out he found out a girl he was dating,

1362
01:24:51.911 --> 01:24:55.300
one of the first questions he asked is if her parents were still together and if

1363
01:24:55.301 --> 01:24:58.910
they were still together,
he,
there will be a second date.
And if there,

1364
01:24:59.110 --> 01:25:03.490
if they weren't still together,
there wasn't a second date and a,

1365
01:25:03.491 --> 01:25:05.680
I know a lot of people would get offended about that shit,

1366
01:25:05.681 --> 01:25:09.040
but that's a great way to get a pure bred,
you know,

1367
01:25:10.630 --> 01:25:13.470
other shit,
you know,
I don't know you,

1368
01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:15.520
you just got to make a list of what the fuck you want.

1369
01:25:15.521 --> 01:25:17.560
But you really got to stop.
Uh,

1370
01:25:18.790 --> 01:25:20.800
you got to stop fucking with the horse and it's a hard thing.

1371
01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:25.450
It's definitely a hard thing.
And,
uh,
ah,
Jeez.
I'm just,

1372
01:25:25.451 --> 01:25:28.160
I'm a little jet lag here,
dude.
If you ask me something a little more space,

1373
01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:30.040
some better when you ask me specific things,

1374
01:25:30.250 --> 01:25:33.760
because if you asked me an overall question like that.
All right,

1375
01:25:33.761 --> 01:25:37.720
what else can I come on,
Bill?
Think,
uh,
alright.
Everybody's nuts.

1376
01:25:38.530 --> 01:25:41.980
Including you.
And uh,
so you got to,

1377
01:25:43.060 --> 01:25:46.000
you got to find,
you've got to pick someone that compliments your crazy.

1378
01:25:46.900 --> 01:25:49.590
You know what I mean?
You can't and you won't.

1379
01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:52.510
You think you want to get somebody who's the same kind of crazy.

1380
01:25:52.511 --> 01:25:55.810
So then you guys relate to each other.
But that's,

1381
01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:59.230
that's not good because then you're both going bat shit at the same time.

1382
01:25:59.770 --> 01:26:04.040
And when that happens,
you,
neither one of you have anybody call to bail

1383
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:08.000
<v 6>you out of the holding cell.
Um,
you know what I mean?</v>

1384
01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:12.590
Um,
what else?
Jesus fucking Christ,
uh,

1385
01:26:12.620 --> 01:26:17.150
don't date those girls who say they used to be a whore,
but now they're not.

1386
01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:21.140
Don't date those girls.
Um,

1387
01:26:23.150 --> 01:26:27.290
what else?
I don't fucking know,
Dude.
I'm,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm really trying here.

1388
01:26:27.291 --> 01:26:30.950
You know what to write.
Write me back next week.
Ask me something more specific.

1389
01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:34.190
I'm just really go,
I'm going blank here.
I'm really,

1390
01:26:34.191 --> 01:26:36.920
I'm really choking on this one.
I usually have a ton of shit to say.

1391
01:26:36.921 --> 01:26:41.060
Why is my fucking software updates are available for your computer?

1392
01:26:41.061 --> 01:26:45.890
Do you want to install them now?
I'm doing a fucking podcast.
Not now.

1393
01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:48.831
Uh,
Shit.
Well you know what,

1394
01:26:48.831 --> 01:26:51.890
if anybody else out there has some fucking advice to give him,
obviously I got,

1395
01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:52.753
I got nothing.

1396
01:26:53.270 --> 01:26:56.420
I only have advice about how to get out of relationships like that dude,

1397
01:26:56.421 --> 01:26:59.210
that one time he was asking me and you want the biggest thing,

1398
01:26:59.211 --> 01:27:00.290
I actually had to email him back,

1399
01:27:00.291 --> 01:27:04.370
I forgot to tell him was when he was getting away from that just to do a recap.

1400
01:27:04.370 --> 01:27:05.360
He was with this girl,

1401
01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:08.660
she had a couple of kids with another guy and he was kind of in the relationship

1402
01:27:08.661 --> 01:27:12.080
with her and he was semi passed out when he was drunk and when,

1403
01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:15.650
when he walked up she was fucking flirting with,

1404
01:27:16.490 --> 01:27:17.510
with his best friend.

1405
01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:21.680
So he's trying to get out of the relationship and I told him basically he knew

1406
01:27:21.681 --> 01:27:26.360
what he needed to do,
but I forgot the number one thing that I,
uh,

1407
01:27:26.830 --> 01:27:31.100
I forgot to tell him was under no circumstances should he ever fuck that girl

1408
01:27:31.101 --> 01:27:33.240
again.
Uh,

1409
01:27:33.430 --> 01:27:36.500
you've got to watch out for those girls that already have kids by somebody else.

1410
01:27:36.501 --> 01:27:38.660
You really got to watch out in general.

1411
01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:41.270
You got to watch out during that breakup time.

1412
01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:45.170
You really got to watch out because there's a lot of crazy fucking people go

1413
01:27:45.171 --> 01:27:47.540
nuts guys.
And women go nuts.

1414
01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:51.320
Guys could get physical that he start stocking you.
They go that route.

1415
01:27:51.530 --> 01:27:56.480
Women can get crazy and accidentally take themselves off the fucking pill

1416
01:27:58.130 --> 01:28:01.220
in some sort of fucked up desperation.

1417
01:28:01.221 --> 01:28:04.340
Either they keep it going or was even worse,
some sort of vengeance thing.

1418
01:28:04.460 --> 01:28:07.580
They just not thinking clearly and then they get knocked up and next thing you

1419
01:28:07.581 --> 01:28:11.000
know,
they're thinking clearly and they don't want the fucking kid either.

1420
01:28:11.001 --> 01:28:14.360
And yet you're joined at the hip,
so wear a fucking condom.

1421
01:28:14.361 --> 01:28:19.340
That's another thing to wear a fucking condom.
And uh,

1422
01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:23.030
yeah,
do that shit.
Wear a condom.
You know,
that's another good thing too.

1423
01:28:23.031 --> 01:28:26.120
If you get with a girl and she starts asking you if you've been tested and that

1424
01:28:26.121 --> 01:28:30.320
type of shit,
that's a good thing.
You want a Bronx tale?

1425
01:28:30.321 --> 01:28:34.630
Like lock the door test hookup with a girl.
All right.
And uh,

1426
01:28:34.670 --> 01:28:37.640
when you get ready to do the deed,
don't bring up a condom.

1427
01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:40.250
And if she doesn't flinch,
you know,

1428
01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:44.090
stand up and just walk out with yard on.

1429
01:28:46.430 --> 01:28:48.170
No one has the fucking strength to do that,

1430
01:28:48.171 --> 01:28:51.680
but at least for the love of God fucking put one on.
All right.
That's it.
Do that.

1431
01:28:51.690 --> 01:28:54.860
That advice really sucked.
I'm telling you,
just asked me something more specific.

1432
01:28:54.861 --> 01:28:58.100
I'll try to help you out.
Um,
all right,

1433
01:28:58.310 --> 01:29:00.380
let's get to the final thing that I'm going to do this week.

1434
01:29:00.410 --> 01:29:02.070
A little jet lag this week

1435
01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:04.080
<v 5>and it's hot as fuck in this room.</v>

1436
01:29:04.081 --> 01:29:07.150
For some reason I can't open the goddamn windows because a,

1437
01:29:07.170 --> 01:29:09.260
it picks up every sound from the street.
Uh,

1438
01:29:09.330 --> 01:29:11.640
last week I actually asked a question about,
uh,

1439
01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:17.600
how to change the default on my computer for the size of the font when I type

1440
01:29:18.091 --> 01:29:21.890
out my files because I'm really bad at computers and uh,

1441
01:29:21.930 --> 01:29:25.230
somebody actually helped me out with it.
Like that day.
It's really simple.

1442
01:29:26.250 --> 01:29:28.140
If you're an apple work,
she'd go to edit

1443
01:29:29.790 --> 01:29:32.760
a up on the toolbar there.
You Click on edit,

1444
01:29:33.510 --> 01:29:38.130
fucking do it right now and click on edit and what do you wait,

1445
01:29:38.131 --> 01:29:40.860
what the fuck?
This doesn't make sense.
Go to edit.
No,

1446
01:29:40.861 --> 01:29:44.040
you don't click on apple works.
That's what you want to do.
Go on apple works.

1447
01:29:44.041 --> 01:29:47.790
Then you click on prevalence premise preferences.

1448
01:29:49.180 --> 01:29:52.350
All right,
let me start over again.
You go to apple works,
click on that.

1449
01:29:52.890 --> 01:29:55.980
You go into preferences and then you click on general.

1450
01:29:57.510 --> 01:30:01.620
And uh,
let's see if I can do this here.
Oh yeah.

1451
01:30:01.621 --> 01:30:04.380
And then you'll see your default size is right there.

1452
01:30:04.410 --> 01:30:06.120
And then you just click on the fucking heroin.

1453
01:30:06.121 --> 01:30:09.210
You could pick one of those sides and then he hit.
Okay.
That's how you doing.

1454
01:30:09.420 --> 01:30:10.740
I know that's very basic.

1455
01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:14.250
If you guys have some more difficult fucking questions you want to ask them on

1456
01:30:14.251 --> 01:30:15.750
this podcast,
I will read them.

1457
01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:19.440
And this computer nerds out there that can not wait to fucking help you.

1458
01:30:21.270 --> 01:30:26.160
Um,
what else do we got here?
I think I have,

1459
01:30:26.250 --> 01:30:30.990
I think I just have a fucking hangover story and then our vengeance thing.
Wow.

1460
01:30:31.020 --> 01:30:33.210
I'm really losing momentum here.
I don't know what to do.

1461
01:30:34.220 --> 01:30:36.120
Say at the beginning of fucking $6 million man.

1462
01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:39.330
You know when that little fucking kite that he's flying,

1463
01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:42.030
why don't they ever show that fucking show in reruns?

1464
01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:45.780
That's one of the greatest goddamn shows ever.
Do you guys ever see that?

1465
01:30:45.990 --> 01:30:50.940
You have any idea how fucking huge it was when the $6 million man fought the $7

1466
01:30:50.940 --> 01:30:55.940
million man and he punched his fucking face off his face came off on television

1467
01:30:58.530 --> 01:31:03.360
in like 1974.
Do you have any fucking idea?
Think about that.
Pre Internet,

1468
01:31:03.510 --> 01:31:06.960
pre cable,
pre any sort of special effect.

1469
01:31:07.350 --> 01:31:10.260
You look how bad the graphics were in Star Wars.
This is like three,

1470
01:31:10.261 --> 01:31:15.261
four years before that Lee Majors Punch this dude who was the fucking bad guy

1471
01:31:17.010 --> 01:31:19.890
and everything.
Oh Man.

1472
01:31:19.980 --> 01:31:22.080
Do you remember the one where the $6 million man fight up,

1473
01:31:22.081 --> 01:31:25.680
fought in the snow outside that mansion and they had everybody in slow motion

1474
01:31:25.770 --> 01:31:29.730
and that black dude jumped like 10 feet in the air was going to kick him.

1475
01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:34.200
He's gone
flying through the fucking air.

1476
01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:37.200
Then you've got to stand how sheltered I was as a kid.

1477
01:31:37.290 --> 01:31:38.820
I didn't even know who Bruce Lee was.

1478
01:31:38.821 --> 01:31:40.500
I don't even know what Kung Fu fighting was.

1479
01:31:40.501 --> 01:31:45.160
And I didn't realize that TV shows were ripping off,
you know,
uh,

1480
01:31:45.180 --> 01:31:48.120
enter the dragon and all that shit that people were flipping out about.

1481
01:31:48.270 --> 01:31:51.390
Cause I was just a little kid.
So I saw that shit.
I,
I,

1482
01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:54.180
it was the most unbelievable thing ever.
He fought big foot.

1483
01:31:54.420 --> 01:31:59.040
He fought a black Bruce Lee and he fought the $7 million man and he punched his

1484
01:31:59.050 --> 01:32:00.280
fucking face off

1485
01:32:01.100 --> 01:32:06.020
<v 6>and uh,
tele.
They just don't,
they don't make,
it's impossible to compete now.</v>

1486
01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:08.150
There's just,
they've just done too many things.

1487
01:32:09.130 --> 01:32:09.963
<v 5>You know,</v>

1488
01:32:11.140 --> 01:32:13.780
<v 6>it's kind of like when you go to write a movie script and like everything's been</v>

1489
01:32:13.781 --> 01:32:16.990
done and they act like all these guys back in the forties and fifties were

1490
01:32:16.991 --> 01:32:20.560
brilliant.
It's like fuck you.
There was only like five movies were ever made.

1491
01:32:20.590 --> 01:32:24.180
How hard was it to be brilliant back then?
It's like inventing shit in the,

1492
01:32:24.340 --> 01:32:27.910
in the 1800 [inaudible] oh look,
it's a coat hanger.

1493
01:32:27.970 --> 01:32:30.940
You can hang your coat on it.
Holy Shit.

1494
01:32:31.870 --> 01:32:33.490
Let's put his name in the history books.

1495
01:32:33.491 --> 01:32:35.890
Everyone can fucking remember this for the rest of the time.

1496
01:32:36.430 --> 01:32:38.350
I don't even know what you could invent.
You always great.

1497
01:32:38.351 --> 01:32:40.450
It's still inventing a simple shit.

1498
01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:44.620
Is that Billy Mays guy you don't let bear did fuck every night.

1499
01:32:44.621 --> 01:32:48.400
He just starts sobbing.
Billy Mays.
That dude,

1500
01:32:49.510 --> 01:32:50.740
he doesn't even event the shit.

1501
01:32:50.741 --> 01:32:54.310
I think he invented like three things and then he's just got a sweatshop or like

1502
01:32:54.311 --> 01:32:58.510
smart fucking kids from Thailand and he just comes walking in.

1503
01:32:58.511 --> 01:33:02.290
I keep borrowing and myself on the iron.
Come up with some shit.

1504
01:33:03.330 --> 01:33:06.390
Then like three weeks later he's on TV.
Are Billy Mays,

1505
01:33:07.170 --> 01:33:12.170
are you tired of burn their hair off your forearm or your in your button down

1506
01:33:12.540 --> 01:33:16.980
cause your third marriage didn't work out and you still have to date in your 50s

1507
01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:21.420
introducing the fucking thing.

1508
01:33:21.421 --> 01:33:25.980
You stick in front of the iron that doesn't burn your forearm but still irons,

1509
01:33:26.140 --> 01:33:30.940
<v 5>fucking shirt.
Um,
anyways.
Oh let me get,</v>

1510
01:33:30.941 --> 01:33:33.460
let me get back to this thing.
Sorry.
Huh.
See like that.
There you go.

1511
01:33:33.461 --> 01:33:37.270
I wanted to stand at Mo gave me some fucking laughs.
Okay.
All right.

1512
01:33:37.271 --> 01:33:39.810
Hang over here.
Let me get,
let me get back here.
So here's a hangover.

1513
01:33:39.820 --> 01:33:43.660
Last week I did a,
I did a podcast where he had a hangover and ah,

1514
01:33:43.930 --> 01:33:47.530
somebody gave me some sort of Ah,
ah Jesus,

1515
01:33:47.531 --> 01:33:50.320
can you tell them stolen at the time cause I went to the wrong fucking place.

1516
01:33:50.380 --> 01:33:54.390
Advice I give that guy horrible advice.
Um,

1517
01:33:55.770 --> 01:33:58.380
all right.
Yeah.
I was kind of fucking hung over the last week,

1518
01:33:58.381 --> 01:34:02.700
so I had somebody give me advice on how to cure a hangover and a,

1519
01:34:02.701 --> 01:34:06.450
this is what I got.
Here's a grace.
Here's a great hangover tip.

1520
01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:08.340
Works for me most of the time.

1521
01:34:08.370 --> 01:34:13.260
Eat a greasy breakfast with all the coffee you can fucking stomach the morning

1522
01:34:13.261 --> 01:34:14.420
after drinking.
[inaudible]

1523
01:34:14.460 --> 01:34:19.170
I recommend waffle house or some other piece of shit diner.
You know what?

1524
01:34:19.171 --> 01:34:21.420
Some people,
you know what?
I've always heard the greasy breakfast thing.

1525
01:34:21.421 --> 01:34:24.150
People actually had some other ones I had never heard of and I evidently I

1526
01:34:24.151 --> 01:34:27.980
didn't fucking,
I didn't save those.
Oh,
well.
Well,

1527
01:34:27.981 --> 01:34:29.480
we're going to end the podcast right here.

1528
01:34:29.481 --> 01:34:34.250
We're going to end with a revenge story.
All right?
Uh,
all right,
Bill.

1529
01:34:34.251 --> 01:34:37.310
Sometimes revenge comes when you least expect it.

1530
01:34:37.820 --> 01:34:40.400
I like that this person started their revenge story with this.

1531
01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:45.680
That sounds like a great trailer for a,
for a summer blockbuster.
You know,

1532
01:34:45.681 --> 01:34:47.120
Tom Hanks,
Meg Ryan,

1533
01:34:47.450 --> 01:34:51.260
and some other Douche bag that you don't give a fuck star in the revenge.

1534
01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:56.780
Sometimes revenge comes when you least expect it.
All right.
My,

1535
01:34:56.790 --> 01:35:01.550
my brother Jamie had always tease me about something since it had happened when

1536
01:35:01.551 --> 01:35:02.660
I was about 15,

1537
01:35:04.610 --> 01:35:08.810
but I can't tell you what it was because it will ruin the rest of the story.

1538
01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:13.970
But I had my day of revenge.
All right.
Fast Forward Tor.
Uh,

1539
01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:15.110
fast forward eight years,

1540
01:35:15.111 --> 01:35:19.910
I was managing a rock band full time and my brother was about to move out to la

1541
01:35:20.210 --> 01:35:23.540
to take a shot at acting.
So we had moved out of his apartment,

1542
01:35:23.541 --> 01:35:28.370
was temporary temporarily crashing up the street from my place at a mutual

1543
01:35:28.371 --> 01:35:29.204
friend's apartment.

1544
01:35:29.630 --> 01:35:32.690
We all lived in these apartments in a small town in South Jersey.

1545
01:35:32.691 --> 01:35:34.220
Me and one of the guys from the band,

1546
01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:37.640
we're living in an apartment that was connected to a house,

1547
01:35:38.030 --> 01:35:41.210
have a family we sort of grew up with.
They had a son,
Charlie,

1548
01:35:41.211 --> 01:35:45.230
who was our age but had down's syndrome.
So we still lived at home.

1549
01:35:45.530 --> 01:35:50.300
Charlie would always seem to pop into our apartment at the worst times.
Uh,

1550
01:35:50.301 --> 01:35:50.660
you know,

1551
01:35:50.660 --> 01:35:54.320
in like the middle of parties when we were smoking pot or maybe when I was on

1552
01:35:54.321 --> 01:35:56.270
the couch with a girl trying to get laid,

1553
01:35:56.360 --> 01:36:00.320
he just had this timing where he would show up at the exactly the wrong time.

1554
01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:02.390
On this particular Sunday afternoon,

1555
01:36:02.391 --> 01:36:05.630
I called my brother to let them know we had ordered some pizzas and sandwiches

1556
01:36:05.631 --> 01:36:08.930
and he could come over and have some,
have some,
if he wanted a,

1557
01:36:08.931 --> 01:36:13.010
we'd all been drinking heavily the night before as me and the band were out of

1558
01:36:13.011 --> 01:36:17.170
town,
out of town on tour.
My brother got perfectly blunted.

1559
01:36:17.171 --> 01:36:19.150
I think he was supposed to try to say,
uh,

1560
01:36:19.151 --> 01:36:23.830
the previous night and I knew he'd be,
see,

1561
01:36:23.831 --> 01:36:25.590
this is what sucks about this small

1562
01:36:25.620 --> 01:36:29.070
<v 6>fucking font.
Please write in bigger type guys or us.</v>

1563
01:36:29.071 --> 01:36:31.170
I got to put my face right up to the goddamn screen.

1564
01:36:31.171 --> 01:36:33.180
You guys are making me blind here.
All right.

1565
01:36:33.181 --> 01:36:37.350
My brother got fucked up the other night and I knew he'd be on our buddy's couch

1566
01:36:37.650 --> 01:36:40.290
just hating life.
But when I called him up,

1567
01:36:40.380 --> 01:36:43.980
he was being a bitch and asked if I could actually bring the fucking food over

1568
01:36:44.140 --> 01:36:46.520
to her.
You guys understand what's going on here.

1569
01:36:46.670 --> 01:36:49.910
They're all hung over his brother order some pizzas and out of the goodness of

1570
01:36:49.911 --> 01:36:53.060
his heart,
he calls his brother up the street and the fucking lazy concert.

1571
01:36:53.210 --> 01:36:57.830
Can you,
can you bring it over?
So this,
so there's dude,
like a normal person says,

1572
01:36:57.831 --> 01:37:02.690
fuck no,
I bought the food.
I'm offering you some if you want it,
just come over.

1573
01:37:03.410 --> 01:37:06.920
But he couldn't get off the couch.
I'm Charlie,

1574
01:37:06.950 --> 01:37:11.210
the down syndrome kid who must've seen the pizza delivery guy knocked on our

1575
01:37:11.211 --> 01:37:13.590
door minutes later.
Uh,

1576
01:37:13.591 --> 01:37:16.430
my roommate Tom and I then thought of something fun to do.

1577
01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:20.600
Charlie actually really liked my brother.
They were always messing around.

1578
01:37:20.601 --> 01:37:23.210
But if you ever,
if you ever hung out with a kid with Down's syndrome,

1579
01:37:23.211 --> 01:37:27.170
that usually means he wants to fight or fight you or wrestle.

1580
01:37:27.710 --> 01:37:30.440
This is reminding me of something about Mary.
Um,

1581
01:37:30.441 --> 01:37:33.590
since my brother was being such a lazy turn and when come over,

1582
01:37:33.591 --> 01:37:37.700
we thought it'd be funny to have Charlie delivered the pizza to Jamie since we

1583
01:37:37.701 --> 01:37:39.530
knew Charlie,
I guess James,
his brother,

1584
01:37:40.590 --> 01:37:42.610
<v 5>excuse me.
MMM.</v>

1585
01:37:43.860 --> 01:37:44.110
<v 6>Whatever.</v>

1586
01:37:44.110 --> 01:37:47.220
I have Charlie delivered to Jamie since we knew Charlie would immediately wants

1587
01:37:47.221 --> 01:37:48.660
to wrestle and fuck around with him,

1588
01:37:48.661 --> 01:37:51.700
constant consequently would make his hangover much fucking worse.

1589
01:37:53.220 --> 01:37:55.020
<v 5>So anyways,
I'm mutual friends with,
with us.</v>

1590
01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:57.640
And he had the key to the apartment where,

1591
01:37:57.690 --> 01:37:59.160
where my brother was staying on the couch.

1592
01:37:59.310 --> 01:38:02.070
We all walked over to the apartment and,
uh,

1593
01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:07.120
down the hall to the Living Room where my brother was on the couch with the back

1594
01:38:07.141 --> 01:38:09.420
of the couch towards the door and the TV facing us.

1595
01:38:09.421 --> 01:38:12.410
We immediately realized that my brother was watching a nasty,

1596
01:38:12.810 --> 01:38:17.810
nasty porno and was beating off Jesus Christ.

1597
01:38:19.590 --> 01:38:21.960
I started to say,
Hey,
here's your pizza.

1598
01:38:23.340 --> 01:38:26.610
And then I was like,
oh,
no.
But,
uh,
Charlie,

1599
01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:29.160
Charlie first pass me there.

1600
01:38:29.161 --> 01:38:33.360
My brother's stuck his head up over the back of the couch before he knew it.

1601
01:38:34.020 --> 01:38:38.550
Charlie used all of his retard strength to give Jamie the haymaker of a lifetime

1602
01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:43.140
to the back of his head.
My brother was dazed and early confused.

1603
01:38:43.141 --> 01:38:47.970
He stood up and had on Oli and old half shirt from high school football and

1604
01:38:47.971 --> 01:38:50.610
white socks and oh yeah,
he had a raging hard on.

1605
01:38:50.910 --> 01:38:55.910
Now Charlie's coming at him go and my brother's looking at us to stop Charlie,

1606
01:38:56.220 --> 01:38:59.460
but we're all laughing too hard and none of us were going to go anywhere near

1607
01:38:59.461 --> 01:39:03.030
that situation.
Uh,
Charlie.
Okay.
I mean,
would you,

1608
01:39:03.031 --> 01:39:07.860
would you break up a fight between a nearly naked guy with a boner and a kid

1609
01:39:07.861 --> 01:39:10.770
with down syndrome?
Where would you start?
Um,

1610
01:39:10.830 --> 01:39:14.280
Charlie was not quitting and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

1611
01:39:14.730 --> 01:39:18.540
and he's put a on his best move was to punch your balls.
Jesus Christ.
Dude,

1612
01:39:18.541 --> 01:39:21.270
did this really happen?
This sounds fucking crazy.
Um,

1613
01:39:21.271 --> 01:39:23.380
he was coming at Jamie with everything he had.
Uh,

1614
01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:25.670
my brother was just trying to hold them off till is harder,

1615
01:39:25.700 --> 01:39:28.800
hard on subsided and he could gather himself.
Meanwhile,

1616
01:39:28.801 --> 01:39:32.370
the TV's still on all loud and some nasty old fat chick was getting banged in

1617
01:39:32.371 --> 01:39:36.660
the ass by some black dude.
It was complete mayhem.
It all happens so fast.

1618
01:39:36.930 --> 01:39:37.763
Finally,

1619
01:39:38.100 --> 01:39:41.460
my brother pushed Charlie away far enough to grab his shorts and put them on.

1620
01:39:41.461 --> 01:39:44.790
Charlie was really tired.
It was really fired up because we had given them,

1621
01:39:45.150 --> 01:39:50.150
giving them a big glass of Pepsi beforehand and I was not supposed to have

1622
01:39:50.251 --> 01:39:54.810
caffeine.
Well that's,
that's a great thing to do.
Uh,
Bubba,
Bubba,
Bubba,

1623
01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:58.620
Bubba ball.
Um,
anyways,
my brother would,
okay,
so this is basically the,

1624
01:39:58.680 --> 01:40:00.060
this is the thing.
He was talking about how,

1625
01:40:00.190 --> 01:40:01.560
what his brother used to tease him off.
He said,

1626
01:40:01.561 --> 01:40:04.830
my brother would always used to tease me about the time he caught me beat

1627
01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:09.750
beating off when I was 15.
He was like a true older brother,
uh,

1628
01:40:09.970 --> 01:40:13.020
two rather brother Dick about it and would bring it up in front of other girls,

1629
01:40:13.170 --> 01:40:15.180
family and whoever,
and just kept,

1630
01:40:15.540 --> 01:40:19.260
just kept doing it for years after the time that retard beat him up while he was

1631
01:40:19.261 --> 01:40:24.240
whacking off,
he never mentioned it again.
Cheers.
Jesus Christ.

1632
01:40:24.380 --> 01:40:29.280
Dude did that.
Did that all really happen?
Um,
sorry about saying retard too.

1633
01:40:29.281 --> 01:40:30.150
I never say that shit.

1634
01:40:30.151 --> 01:40:33.510
He just had written that I tried to say fucking down syndrome as much as I
could.

1635
01:40:33.810 --> 01:40:38.080
There you go.
You found a line.
I usually don't say that shit.
Um,
anyway,

1636
01:40:38.081 --> 01:40:41.060
so that's the podcast for the weekend.
I was pretty fucking a,

1637
01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:43.920
that's pretty fucked up.
You know,

1638
01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:47.400
you've got a 19 minute one and you've got a 35 minute once.
What does that make?

1639
01:40:47.401 --> 01:40:51.750
That makes foams?
That's like almost 55 fucking minutes.
Um,

1640
01:40:51.780 --> 01:40:56.260
I'm going to be at the Improv in Los Angeles,
um,
in May.

1641
01:40:56.350 --> 01:41:00.040
I don't know what weekend yet.
I believe it's the weekend of May 20 something.

1642
01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:05.200
And uh,
other than that we're going to be filling in some stand updates.
Um,

1643
01:41:05.230 --> 01:41:09.250
and that's it.
Thank you guys for listening to the Monday morning podcast.

1644
01:41:09.251 --> 01:41:12.970
Please keep the questions coming and coming and I apologize I was a little bit

1645
01:41:12.971 --> 01:41:16.060
jet lag.
That's two fucking weeks in a row,
you know,

1646
01:41:16.090 --> 01:41:18.850
hung over last week jetlag this week.
But you know,

1647
01:41:18.851 --> 01:41:19.900
what the fuck do you want for me?

1648
01:41:19.901 --> 01:41:22.860
It's called the Monday morning podcast and I have to do it on this day,

1649
01:41:23.220 --> 01:41:26.560

I hope you guys enjoyed it and I'll talk to you next week.

1650
