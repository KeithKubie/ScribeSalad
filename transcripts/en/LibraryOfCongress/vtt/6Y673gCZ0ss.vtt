00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.260
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress, in Washington, D.C.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.340
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins: Good morning.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:38.040
We know we are now back from the
summer holidays and we are ready

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.320
to dig in with the
important work that we do.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.200
Judith Cannan had to come by
the office, I was off last week,

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.530 position:56%
to make sure I had not forgotten
where I was, and what I was supposed

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.620
to be doing [laughter], and
she happened to see me looking

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.340
at the flier so at least she knew
I remembered there was a program

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.860
this morning.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.030
This is another in the series
that Library Services sponsors,

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.840
LC's Digital Future and You, that
is coordinated by Judith Cannan

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.420
of the COIN Division, and
Angela Kinney of ALAWE,

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.430
who is on leave this week.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.920
I am Beacher Wiggins,
Director of Acquisitions

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.300
and Bibliographic Access for
the one person who may not know

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.420
who I am [laughter], and I'm going
to kick off this morning's session.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.580
The title "BIBFRAME
On the Move" is trying

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:42.050
to capture the ever evolving
development of the Library

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:48.500
of Congress' initiative,
and foray into linked data.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.800
It's a prime initiative.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:56.560
We want to give you a sense of
what has happened, where we are,

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.910
and what we are expecting to
occur over the next few months,

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:06.870
and particularly into fiscal 2017.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.110
So I'm going to give you
and our participants, today,

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.690
I should run those down, and
we'll just follow in order.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.280
And we think saving questions
until the end is better,

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.470
but if you have burning questions
as each one of us finishes,

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.000
and you raise your
hand, we will stop

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.440
and answer those questions for you.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.430
So in addition to me,
we will have Kirk Hess

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.940
from the Network Development
and MARC Standards Office,

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.880
and Paul Frank from COIN,
who will play off each other,

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.940
and give you a sense of the
BIBFRAME Editor, how that worked,

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.260
which is one of the
centerpieces in terms

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.400
of the tools used to
work with BIBFRAME.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.550
Then we have Sally McCallum, who
is Chief of the Network Development

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.690
and MARC Standards Office, who
will tell us about the plans

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.350 position:56%
for the next phase of our operation,

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.560
and I'll give you a very brief
background of where we are

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.680
and then move into Kirk
and Paul's taking over.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:30.020
About this time last year I
guess it was, I had determined

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.200
that we needed to do a pilot.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.340
Well I guess it was a little
bit beyond a year ago,

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.440
do a pilot to test what we had
been talking about, we the Library

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.830
of Congress, in terms of BIBFRAME.

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.180 position:56%
And I was adamant that we move
forward, whether we were quite ready

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.890
or not, and we were, in some
respects, not quite ready

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.640
but we rose to the occasion.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:00.250
So by late 2014 early 2015, we were
moving forward, because we wanted

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.400
to test the efficacy of
BIBFRAME, how we could use it

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.900
and what components of it
we could test going forward,

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.070
and in particular, the
ability of our staff

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.050
to be able to deal with that.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.120
To that end, then, we identified
some 40 to 45 staff members,

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.460
both within the Acquisitions
and Bibliographic Access area,

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:23.230
and in the Special Formats
areas, to help us carry it out.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.100
And we got a mix of
cataloguists, technicians,

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.380
and we covered all format
types, languages and scripts.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.660
Monographs, serials, cartographic
materials, music, notated,

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.700
sound recordings, two-dimensional
artwork, bringing in our colleagues

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.090
from Prints and Photographs.

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.230
We wanted the staff to process
whatever materials they normally

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.540
process, whatever crossed
their desks, and we wanted them

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.790
to do it using the BIBFRAME Editor.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.680
But in addition, because the
Library of Congress must continue

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.070
to distribute its cataloguing
data in MARC format,

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:03.860
they also had to catalogue those
same items using the MARC format.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.370
So obviously that was going to cut

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.140
into their time and
their production.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:15.160
So production was never
a focus of the pilot.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:23.910
We termed an idea, when
I talked to the classes

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.680
that were being instructed
in preparation,

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.330
and the COIN Division did say
training, that these spoke

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.600
with prior needs, one, because
we had some development work

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.370 position:56%
that we were still doing, and we
wanted input and feedback from them,

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.080
and frankly because they were
doing something that was new,

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.440
and we weren't quite sure what
we were going to get out of that.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.020
To be prepared, they attended
some 16 hours of training,

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:54.750
instruction that was
being offered by COIN.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.400
And the pilot preparation on
the technical side then was done

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.240
by Network Development
and MARC Standards Office,

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:06.410
and that included being able to
create a BIBFRAME-like environment.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:11.600
And that called on transforming
the existing MARC records,

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.270
some 18 million were targeted
into BIBFRAME description,

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:21.880
so that the participants would have
that environment to search against,

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:26.400
as if they were in a
production mode for BIBFRAME.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.730
The outcome was commendable.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:38.260
That did actually convert some
13.5 million records into work

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.310
and instance records,
so that the staff

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.590
who were participating would
be able to do the searching

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.190
and to get a feel for
what that would be like.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.170
Sally may go into more
detail about that,

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:56.100
and how that might change
for the upcoming pilot.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:03.330
The BIBFRAME Editor was developed
as the primary tool for the staff

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.600
to use, and we'll get
more information on that.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:12.390
The staff used the authorities
as they were in LC.gov,

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:17.120
and had that as a basis for
the authority was created,

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:26.970 position:56%
and how that was going to enact with
the work that they would perform.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.350
Some-the last number I got was

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:33.430
like 2,000 BIBFRAME
descriptions that were created.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.540
I'm sure that's more like 3,000
now, because one of the things

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:40.500
that we did, and what I haven't
said so far, is that the pilot ran

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:48.260
from October 1, 2015 through March
31, 2016, and during that period,

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.680
some 2,000 descriptions
were created.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.900
At the end of the pilot, so
that staff would continue

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:57.630
to retain the skills
that they had developed,

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:02.550
I determined that they should
develop, devote one day per week

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:06.090
to continuing to grade
records in BIBFRAME.

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:09.820
I also should note that
the day it was created,

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:14.550
was done in the BIBFRAME 1.0
environment, and all those data

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:16.460 position:56%
that were created will be discarded,

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:18.370
because this was all
in the test mode.

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:22.140
We will think differently
about the upcoming pilot,

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:26.090
and Sally may speak a bit more
to that in terms of the stability

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:30.070
of the data that will be created.

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:32.400
The next thing that
had-well, one of the things

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.610 position:56%
that happened during this period
was the development of BIBFRAME 2.0,

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:40.890 position:56%
and that is going to be the platform
and underpinning that will be used

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:45.070
for the pilot going forward,
and will be the basis of a lot

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:47.730
of the testing that will be
going on, not just in the Library

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:51.070
of Congress, but also as part
of our external partners,

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:54.660
that Sally may also touch on a bit.

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:59.640
The one thing I should mention
before turning over to Kirk

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:06.260
and Paul is that work flow didn't
change, because staff had to work

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:07.660
in both environments,

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:11.560
we just overlaid whatever staff
were doing in their regular work.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:16.830
So we did not test the work flow,
and we have not done an analysis

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:19.850
of how BIBFRAME will
affect work flow.

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:21.860
And the other piece, we should say,

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:28.100
is that it also doesn't affect
the acquisitions side of it,

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:32.110
or the user access to the
data that are created.

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:34.710
All of those will be components
that we'll have to worry

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:36.070
about as we move forward.

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:39.560
So as you can see, there
is a lot to be done.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:44.110
I think we've made great strides
in terms of what we want the pilot

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:47.480
to do to show that we could do
this, that we could develop a tool

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:51.220
that staff could use, that
staff could actually adapt to.

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:52.680
I think we did that.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:57.280
The next challenge for
us is expanding this.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.820
Do we use the same participants?

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.210
Do we expand the number
of participants?

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:03.280
How do we get that training done?

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:07.110
One of the things that I want is to
make sure we're developing a cadre

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:10.850
of experts that we can
expand and build on so

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:12.150
that as we roll this out.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:15.570
And ultimately we'll have to
go beyond Library Services,

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:18.930
and beyond ABA, in terms
of what we want to do.

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:24.590
So with that very high
level synopsis, now-well,

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:26.220
are there any burning questions

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:31.590
for me before I turn it
over to Kirk and Paul?

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:36.670
Seeing none, then I
will ask Kirk and Paul

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:41.120
to proceed as they have determined.

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:47.610
&gt;&gt; Paul: Good morning everybody.

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:48.910
&gt;&gt; [Group response] Good morning.

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:53.370 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Paul: Yeah, I'm not as young as
I look [laughter], but it's so funny

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:55.760
when Beacher made that
comment about, you know,

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.000
the beginning of the Fall
season, I still feel like the day

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.880
after Labor Day is the
first day of school,

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.480
so all those nerves
[laughter] and everything.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.190
So here we are on the
first day of school.

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:05.490
But I'm Paul, this is Kirk.

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:12.240
I think of us maybe as Abbott
and Costello [laughter], or Sonny

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:19.190
and Cher-[laughter] but the
point is, pick your duo.

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:23.370
We work very closely as a duo,
and it was very interesting,

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:25.800
because we were facing
in different directions,

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.100
but we had to meet in the middle.

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:32.940
So my focus was on
cataloguers, right?

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:34.630
Reaching out to cataloguers.

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:40.020
Kirk's was finding that interim
between cataloguing and technology,

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:44.010
and facing out toward the
technology environment.

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:49.350
So it was a very productive duo.

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:51.000
And I want to talk a
little bit about that.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.720
And because of that, I thought it
would be good, or it was suggested

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.830
and I agreed it would be a good
approach to have us both stand

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:00.690
up here and have us go back and
forth and talk about our roles

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:06.450
in the BIBFRAME Pilot from
last year, and into this year.

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:08.300
&gt;&gt; Kirk: Hopefully
we can both be heard

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:09.600
with the microphone in the middle.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.900
We didn't think about the
microphone [laughter],

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.900
we're playing the duo,
one microphone.

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.810
Okay.

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:18.340
&gt;&gt; Paul: Alright, so this
dynamic duo didn't come

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:20.200
into play right away, right?

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:28.030
So in 2014, we were given a
BIBFRAME Editor to work with,

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:30.040
to play around with,
to experiment with.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.020
We hadn't even thought
about a Pilot at LC.

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:36.810
We just-here is, here is a
product, let's test it out.

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:39.250
It was really very interesting.

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:41.170
I'm just using screenshots.

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:43.220
You can look down the
left-hand side,

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:49.280
and you see the different formats,
records print, bibliography, books,

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.560
dissertations, paintings.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:52.860
Very broad.

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:57.050
On the right-hand side, you could
see one of the input screens

00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:58.730
that you would use in the editor.

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:02.160 position:56%
Really no different from what we did
in the pilot, but think about this.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.280
You see no code, no cataloguing
code represented here.

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:10.580
I made the comment in the past that
this would be perfect for someone

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:13.930
who had, say, a very large
collection of sound recordings,

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:17.180
personal collections, they
wanted to describe them, right?

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:18.810
Describe your own personal library.

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:20.480
This would be a perfect
way to do it.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.590
If you had LPs, you
could put the album name,

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:25.320
you could put the artist, you
could put the description, subject,

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:28.640
everything that you would need
to use for your own library.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.960
And beyond that, this
could also work very well

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.670
in a public library environment.

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:35.480
A public library could make
great use of something like this.

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.310
But think about the Library of
Congress, and the work that we do,

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:40.720
and compare it against
what we have here.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.540
So one other screenshot
that I wanted

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:45.240
to show you was-and I use
quotes here, "authority work."

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.590
This is how authority
work would have been done

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:50.150
in this prototype system.

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:52.810
It's certainly very user friendly.

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:54.590
If you're creating a
new authority record,

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:55.940
you put first name, last name.

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:58.600
I love that, you know, we're
not dealing with surnames,

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.800
or entry elements, all these
things that cataloguers deal with.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.800
You simply enter in the name.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.690
But the funny part to me was
the birth date, death date.

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:10.470
Now, the comment I made about, you
know, I'm not as young as I look,

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:13.950
when you have to go online, you're
making a profile on some site,

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:16.020
and you have to put
your date of birth.

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:18.170
Well, you don't usually just
enter in your date of birth,

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:20.240
they give you a drop-down
calendar, right?

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:23.310
And you go all the way back, and
I'm old enough to think I wonder

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:26.800
if my year is even on this
list that drops down, right?

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.100
[Laughter] Well, it usually is.

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:31.170
But what would you do if you
were born in the second century?

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:34.750
If you're setting up an authority
record for someone who lived

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:37.690
in the second century, you're going
to have to do a lot of clicking

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:40.300
to get to that calendar,
and then by that point,

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.950
what difference does it make that
the person was born on a Tuesday

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:44.450
or a Wednesday at that point?

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:50.990 position:56%
I mean, it's just, I'm making fun of
this, but I don't want to underplay

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:53.040
that it certainly had a use.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:56.230
It could not, maybe, be used
at the Library of Congress

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.500
for the type of work that we do.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:01.870
On the other side of the
screen you see a new topic.

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:04.660
I mean, think LCSH if
you're a cataloguer.

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:07.710
If you wanted to propose a
new LCSH heading, you know,

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:12.580
there is a very elaborate way to
do that, and certain rules have

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:15.930
to be followed, instructions
have to be consulted.

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:25.590
So the editor that we had in 2014
was a start, but by 2015 we knew

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:29.520
that we were going to have a
pilot at the Library of Congress.

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:32.540
Beacher already gave you a very
good overview of what we did.

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:36.300
Our cataloguing code standard is
Resource Description and Access,

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:42.060
RDA, so we had to take this
editor and turn it into something

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:45.970
that cataloguers could describe
resources using RDA with,

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:50.540
and so that is where the
team came together, this duo,

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:52.920
and I'm going to let Kirk now talk
about all the things that needed

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:57.820
to be done to modify what you see
here and what we used in the pilot.

00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:59.440
&gt;&gt; Kirk: So profile editor.

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.260
So when you-a few slides ago you
saw there was a list in the side

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.040
of Formats, things like book,

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:07.160
or electronic book,
those kinds of things.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.460
So what are those?

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:09.760
Those are profiles.

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.060
So what's a profile?

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:13.010 position:56%
Well it's basically just a template
of fields that are grouped together,

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:16.180
and in the original prototype,
it was hard coded in there.

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:17.640
There was no way to change it.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:21.590
No way to add a new one, other
than coding it by hand in JSON,

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:24.910
which would be very difficult for
people who don't know anything

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:27.190
about JSON, or even
what that stands for.

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:31.620 position:56%
So we contracted out to develop
this tool called the Profile Editor,

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:34.820
and this is what Paul and I used
to develop some of the profiles.

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:36.590
The first one we worked
on was monograph,

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:41.440
because that's always the bulk
of work in technical services.

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:44.460
So you can see here there's a
name, there's some elements,

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:47.420
see at the bottom there is
preferred title for the work,

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:49.200
and you notice it has
these RDA terms.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:53.850
So one of the things we decided
to do was use RDA description,

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:56.760
and that's something Paul is
going to talk about later,

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.960
but basically the idea there is
basically so you know the rules,

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.040
and you can just enter it
in the field, for the rules,

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.230
other than trying to
remember an archaic number,

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:07.450
like MARC, the way that MARC works.

00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:14.810
So another kind of challenge we had
was there are many lists of things,

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:16.480
as well as lookups for things.

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.760 position:56%
So an example of a lookup is a name.

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.060
We talked about that.

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:25.990
Before, you know, you want to
find Tim Carlton is an example

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:28.850
that Paul always uses,
so which Tim Carlton?

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:32.450
Well, you know, the one with
this date, born on this date.

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:36.340 position:56%
So you can look that up in
id.loc.gov, our linked data service.

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:39.310
But we want to make sure it's
actually enabled within the tool,

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:41.960
and so one of the things that was
enabled within this system was

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.260
that at the bottom of the screen,

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.490
you can barely see
there's something-values,

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:49.080
there's a URI there,
which is a lookup service.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:53.310
So zooming in, so that's
actually the URL you can go

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:57.340
to in your browser, and it goes
to the linked data service,

00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:59.930
and you can enter in a keyword
or a name, and it will look up,

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:01.230
and you can see names there.

00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:02.530
Well, it works the
same in the editor,

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:04.370
and that's how it was keyed in.

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:07.950
One of the things Paul
wanted me to mention was

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:10.540
that when we originally did this,

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:14.830
all the lookups while we could
add them to the profiles,

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:16.720
they were hard-coated
into the editor

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:20.220
by the previous instance of this.

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:24.580
So if Paul came up with a new
list, he had to tell me about it.

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:27.960
I had to go in the code, I had to
write more code to add that list,

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:32.300
and in addition to we actually
had to load it into id.loc.gov,

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:35.480 position:56%
so eventually we realized there were
many lists that were already in ID,

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:38.850
but we couldn't use them, because
you had to do this whole process.

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:41.250
So I figured one of the
things I added was the ability

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:46.430
that any generic list that's an ID
could be accessed through the tool.

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:49.910
So that was another
little challenge we had.

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:51.440
It ends up that there
are certain things

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.740
that are a little bit different,
depending on the results.

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:58.030
So in this case, you're
searching for a name-those had

00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:00.020
to be a little bit more specific.

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:03.640
But if you're just looking up
a code, what's another one,

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:07.340
like format, format is one
thing that we had-[inaudible],

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:09.250
those things were just
you could put in there.

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:10.550
So let's see.

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:15.000
So I think Paul is going to
talk about now our Pilot.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.300
&gt;&gt; Paul: Right.

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:19.390
So while Kirk was doing all this
work with the editor that you saw,

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:24.180
or hopefully saw on the slides,
we were gearing up for this Pilot.

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:29.090
Beacher said 40 to 45 cataloguers,
LC cataloguers, all RDA cataloguers

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:33.260
at the beginning, and we added on
some cataloguers who use DCRM(G),

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:37.210
a little bit later, to test
another code in BIBFRAME,

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:40.180
but in order to have the Pilot,

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:43.910
we wanted to at least give
participants some background

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:48.740
in what's going on in this
linked data, semantic web world,

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:50.320
that they're participating in.

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.910
They didn't need to have
exhaustive understanding of this,

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:54.910
but we thought it would
be very helpful for them

00:19:54.910 --> 00:20:00.010
to have a basic understanding of
what their descriptions were going

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:03.800
to do once they got out there,
you know, got out to the web,

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:08.680
or got to another area of access.

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:13.340
So we started with a Module 1,
which we called Introduction

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:15.720
to Semantic Web and Linked Data.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.860
When you have the slides,
you'll be able to hyperlink

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:21.880
from the header here, and go right
to this BIBFRAME training page,

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:23.930
which I encourage everyone
to go to it.

00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:26.710
It's available externally
as well as internally.

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:29.010
There's some very helpful
information there, just if you want

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:32.260
to have a passing understanding, if
you want to increase your knowledge

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:37.090
that you have now, of what's going
on, this is a great place to start.

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:40.730
Module 2, talked about the BIBFRAME
tools that we would be using,

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:44.550
particularly the editor,
the controlled vocabularies

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:47.650
that we access through the linked
data service, things like that,

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:52.180 position:56%
and then the third module was in the
actual use of the BIBFRAME editor.

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:56.680
So the next slide shows you where
we started and where we were

00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:02.200
when the Pilot actually began
last June, June of 2015.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:07.440
So the slide on the image on the
left shows that initial screenshot

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:09.950
that I showed you earlier on.

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:14.240
We've gone now to a much
more robust profile.

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:19.280
All of the profiles we were
using in the Pilot listed here,

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:22.570
all set up according
to RDA instruction.

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:24.540
So that's the important part here.

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:28.180
Now we've introduced a code
into a cataloguing code

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:30.020
into the BIBFRAME editor.

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:33.550
So when you look at the
BIBFRAME editor, you will see,

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:38.600
rather than simply formats listed,
and generic labels for information

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:45.370
that you want to input, RDA
vocabulary is explicitly presented,

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:53.240
so RDA work, RDA expression,
on the-in the editor itself.

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:57.150
The instructions in RDA were
hyperlinked, so if you're working

00:21:57.150 --> 00:22:00.940
with a MARC record,
okay, let me step back,

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:03.610
you're doing MARC cataloguing
in RDA, what do you do?

00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:07.670 position:56%
Well, you look at the MARC tag, what
does this tag mean, you might need

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:09.630
to go to the MARC authority format,

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:11.760
MARC bibliographic
format, to figure that out.

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:18.930
Then you have to make a leap to how
does that MARC element map to RDA?

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:23.670
You're doing a lot of thinking
here, and a lot of work,

00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:28.050
and the BIBFRAME editor,
you click on the link,

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:30.340
you go right into the RDA tool kit.

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:33.490
You can read the instruction,
so we've eliminated

00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:38.510
that intermediate thinking step
that MARC brought into the picture.

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:40.990
Didn't do it intentionally,
it was just a matter of fact,

00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:45.270
that's the way MARC was,
when we used RDA in MARC.

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:50.890
So I highlighted here RDA work, RDA
expression, subject of the work,

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:54.310
creator of the work, to give
you an idea of the RDA-ness

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:57.620 position:56%
of the editor and the profiles here.

00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:00.350
I will say one of the
biggest challenges

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:03.980
in the Pilot was reconciling
the differences in vocabularies

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:06.450
between BIBFRAME and RDA.

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:10.700 position:56%
Whereas BIBFRAME vocabulary does not
have the concept of an expression,

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:15.810
RDA certainly does, and we had
to map in the best way possible

00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:22.330 position:56%
that we could come up with, a way to
reconcile that apparent difference

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:28.160
in vocabulary and the guiding
principle was that cataloguers

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:32.450
in the pilot should not have
to do anything differently

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:34.720
when applying RDA as a code.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.880
Right? We could not introduce
any roadblocks there.

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:39.940
They had to be able to
do their work in RDA,

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:43.120 position:56%
except do it in the BIBFRAME editor.

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:50.480
So one of the facts that we
kept stressing to participants,

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:53.250
even though we asked them to
take some semantic web training

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:54.870
and linked data training was

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:58.790
that once they input a
description using the editor,

00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:01.750
they did not really need to be
too concerned about what came

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:05.930
out the other end, you know,
the Kirk side of the duo.

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:08.410
Through some interesting
turns of events,

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:10.520
it turned out that
we actually did look

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:15.650
at in the Pilot the participants,
we all looked at the output,

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:17.560
but I wanted Kirk to talk
a little bit about that,

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:18.860
because it's certainly something

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:20.160
that he knows much
more about than I do.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.460
This is an example of a record,

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:24.280
of a resource that was
described in BIBFRAME.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:29.420
&gt;&gt; Kirk: Okay, so just, I'll
breeze over this a little bit.

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:33.410
Basically there is an ID at the
top of one of these little groups,

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:39.740 position:56%
and all of them say underscore,
colon, B node, a weird number thing.

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:43.270
Those are just saying that
that's part of a document.

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:47.260
You could have an externally
available URL, or URI,

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:49.620
they call it, that you can access.

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:51.790
Well, in this case, it's
not accessible externally,

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:53.930
it's actually within the document,
but we still want to keep it

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:58.140
as a group, so these are
all subjects, topics,

00:24:58.140 --> 00:24:59.490
in this case, because
that's the type.

00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:00.790
We use the BIBFRAME.

00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:04.320 position:56%
And you also notice here that if you
could actually see this very well,

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.930
it doesn't have RDA
stuff in here now.

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:08.310
Now, we just have BIBFRAME.

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:11.810
So the actual like
encoding format is separate

00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:13.110
from the cataloguing process.

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:16.160
So you use the instructions
from RDA, and you get BIBFRAME.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:20.750
We have two examples here, the
ones that are larger are ones

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:23.890
that we actually could, as I kind
of mentioned before with looking

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:26.150
up names, we could
also look up subjects.

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:30.490
So a subject was looked
up, it's NID, it has a URI,

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:32.590
so that URI is the authority,

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:36.730
and then we also have just-it's
not human readable, really,

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:38.360
I mean it's just a number.

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:42.790
So we also have some access
points, which is something

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:45.940
that BIBFRAME 1.0 used,
as well as a label.

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:51.000
But access points are kind of a-a
construct for an older system,

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.740
where you didn't actually have
a unique identifiable number

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:58.460 position:56%
for something, so you kind of had
to identify it by a series of words.

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:01.320
So now we're kind of
moving away from that,

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:03.710
because we already have something
that is unique, which is the URI,

00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:06.240
and then all you need is
a human readable label,

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.540
and that is something
that is consistent

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:10.340
with how other linked
data systems work.

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:14.910
The second example we ran into is
where using the rules for LCSH,

00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:19.080
you can construct a heading that
may not actually be authorized,

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:20.380
essentially.

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:24.660
So at the bottom, these
ones that are short,

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:26.400
just have an authorized
access point, that's basically

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.860
where the cataloguer
just typed it in.

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:31.100
They looked it up, they typed it in
with all the little double dashes,

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:34.050
and everything that is in there,
it's not really validated.

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:38.820 position:56%
Those all really should have URIs
attached to each one of those parts.

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:42.380
But in the Pilot, we never actually
figured out that particular method,

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:44.140
so that is one of the things
we're going to be working

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:50.090
as our next [inaudible],
so that's that.

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:53.210
Okay, so that's one lesson learned.

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:56.730
&gt;&gt; Paul: Yeah, so now I want to
talk about those very same topics

00:26:56.730 --> 00:27:00.350
from the cataloguing point of
view, that maybe more of you

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:01.940
in the room might be
able to relate to.

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:06.540 position:56%
So this is where the duo had
some-we had some disagreements here,

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:08.760
you know, it wasn't always rosy.

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:14.480
So we had certain constraints
in the Pilot,

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:17.830
and one of them Beacher mentioned,
that we were asking cataloguers

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:20.400
to do duplicative work, right?

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.900
You would do your description
in the Voyager ILS,

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:24.930
and then you would
do it in BIBFRAME.

00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:28.040 position:56%
Toward the end of the Pilot, we
reversed that order, you could start

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:30.940
in BIBFRAME, then go to the
ILS, but cataloguers needed

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:35.170
to do their work two times,
but I think it worked out well,

00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:37.540
and I think we learned
a lot from that.

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:44.770
But what cataloguers do, and what
technology people think cataloguers

00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:48.230 position:56%
do are totally different [laughter].

00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:54.470
So a cataloguer, or
actually, let's not be biased

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:57.740
against technology people, just
the average user, the public user,

00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:05.070
so let's say you go to Google,
and you're looking for something.

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:08.050
Right? You're going to put in
generally a keyword search,

00:28:08.050 --> 00:28:11.060
something is going to come up,
you're going to get results,

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:13.910
you go through, you
refine your search, maybe,

00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:18.790
or maybe you find exactly what
you want in that first screen.

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:23.030 position:56%
That's what a user does, and I think
that's what technology people think

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:24.330
cataloguers do.

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:26.500
But cataloguers are actually
looking for something

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:29.230
that they want to be sure exists.

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:32.680
We're searching to
find duplicate, right?

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:36.730
So we have to have a much
more targeted search.

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:41.590
Keyword searching is great,
but for cataloguing purposes,

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:44.100
that left anchored search
is even more important,

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:47.700
because we're looking for the
known, not for the unknown.

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:53.240
So, for example, I wanted
to use a resource that is

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:55.960
about to be actually has been
published, just this year,

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.710
it's called linked data
for cultural heritage.

00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:00.760
I showed the MARC record, in fact,

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:02.540
Sally McCallum was
involved with this.

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:05.050
She has a chapter in this resource.

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:09.080
I hadn't read it yet, but I'm
looking forward to doing that.

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.970
But I want to just
talk about what we did

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:13.330
with the names and
the subjects here.

00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:18.860
So we have editors, Ed Jones, and
Michelle Sakol [assumed spelling],

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:24.960 position:56%
then we have a really nice array of
LCSH subjects assigned for the work.

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:29.150
So let's take the adjuncts,
I'll give Tim Carlton a break,

00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:32.120
because I'm always using Tim, so I
thought I should get somebody else.

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:34.380
Let's talk about Ed
Jones, and let's talk

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:39.290
about that second-well the
first two subjects, linked data,

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:42.690
but more importantly, the second
one, linked data case studies,

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:46.160
with the form subdivision, and
talk about what BIBFRAME does

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:49.330
with those, with those things.

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:55.180 position:56%
So here is the person lookup that
we would use in the BIBFRAME editor.

00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:56.960
Kirk already told you,
this is searching

00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:00.120
against the name authority
file, as it resides,

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:04.270
as linked data in id.loc.gov.

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:08.370
So a cataloguer at first, when
we were starting the Pilot,

00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:11.680
this was totally relevant
ranked keyword searching.

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:13.770
That is not going to help
a cataloguer who wants

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:16.920
to see how many Ed Jones' there
are, and if the one he wants,

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.430
or she wants, is already
represented.

00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:23.480
So now meeting of the minds, we
now have a left-anchored search

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:26.250
in id.loc.gov, you search in Jones,

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:30.440
and you get a great array
of possibilities here.

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:33.130
Now, one of the advantages
of doing your work

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:37.500 position:56%
in the voyager ILS first is that you
would already have decided which one

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:43.320
of these Ed Jones' you needed,
because right now, in the editor,

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:46.000
you are not able to retrieve
the actual authority record

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.300
to analyze it.

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:49.720
You can only see the 1xx, the
heading, and you know, again,

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:51.750
technology people will go
why is that so important?

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:53.520
You just want the identifier,
that's all that matters,

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.990
and certainly that's true
in the linked data world,

00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:58.910
it's all about identifiers,
but cataloguers still rely

00:30:58.910 --> 00:31:00.290
on that text stream, right?

00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:03.310
So we have to be able to see that.

00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:05.690
So it searches very well in ID,

00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:08.680
and it turns out that the Ed Jones
we want is the one who was born

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:11.120
in 1951, we could click on that.

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:13.220
But you might have noticed
that there is a second box

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:16.710
that says record authorized
access point if added to LCNAF,

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:19.970
but does not appear in id.loc.gov.

00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:22.260
Well, why would that happen?

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:26.460
Because there is an overnight
distribution of authority data

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:31.570
from our Voyager in NACO node,
the voyager name authority file,

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:36.720
into id.loc.gov, if you were
cataloguing that resource today.

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:39.490
The Ed Jones that you needed
had not been established.

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:40.790
You would have to establish it

00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:44.010
in Voyager using our
cataloguing client,

00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:48.220
but the record would not distribute
to id.loc.gov until the next day.

00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:53.110
So we have a way that
cataloguers could input the label,

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:56.690
the authorized access point that
they were creating to hold it

00:31:56.690 --> 00:32:00.140
in the BIBFRAME database.

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:04.020
Now let's talk a little
bit about subjects, again,

00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:06.290
from a cataloguing point
of view and not so much

00:32:06.290 --> 00:32:08.720
from a linked data perspective,

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:11.260
although it certainly has
an impact on linked data.

00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:14.440
That second one that
I highlighted here

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.680
at the top is linked
data with case studies.

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:21.970
Now if we searched subjects, again,
looking up against id.loc.gov,

00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:24.630
we key in linked data,
we get a match.

00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:25.930
It's right there.

00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:27.410
Linked data.

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:30.820
There's nothing in the LCNAF
until somebody holds a conference,

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:32.240
a linked data conference, right?

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:35.060
So we're happy with what we
see, because we want a topic,

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:39.020
we want a topical heading
for this resource.

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:42.560
But you don't see case studies
there, so what's going on?

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:47.130
Why isn't it there?

00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:49.790
For many years, LCSH has worked

00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:55.080
on a very pragmatic principle
using free-floating subdivisions.

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:59.450
So certain topics fit
into categories,

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:02.770
and under those categories,
there can be certain subdivisions

00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:05.430
that are appropriate
to those categories,

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:08.870
so you can pick an appropriate
subdivision from the list

00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:10.930
that is appropriate to the heading.

00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:13.970
And you don't need to
create an authority record.

00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:15.590
This was not always
the case with LCSH,

00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:20.310
at one time there was an
actual authority string created

00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:21.720
for every LCSH heading.

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:26.200
Well, always dangerous to say
"every," but much more regularly.

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.650
But the free-floating practice,

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:33.860 position:56%
fewer authorized heading subdivision
combinations were being created,

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:39.430
but it was an expedient decision
because it increased the time

00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:42.560
of working through production.

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:45.350
I mean, things went faster
when you didn't have to set

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:46.720
up the authorized access point

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:51.040
for every heading subdivision
combination.

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:56.920 position:56%
In fact, although we saw linked data
as an authorized heading in LCSH,

00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:01.590
there is also a subdivision
record for case studies.

00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:07.370
Those subdivisions have their
own authority records as well.

00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:12.430
But what we had to do in the
Pilot was ask cataloguers

00:34:12.430 --> 00:34:17.350
when applying a heading subdivision
combination that conformed

00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:20.750
to free-floating practice
to explicitly put

00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:24.740
in the heading subdivision
combination with the double dashes,

00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:27.560
the traditional LCSH shorthand,

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:33.150
and then that in the BIBFRAME back
end would convert to what you saw

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:36.210
in an earlier slide
that Kirk talked about.

00:34:36.210 --> 00:34:38.630
But now, I'm going to
put Kirk on the spot,

00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:42.750
because what I never was quite
sure about was what happens

00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:45.390
to this string in BIBFRAME?

00:34:45.390 --> 00:34:50.400
So does the ID up here
represent that string?

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:52.050
&gt;&gt; Kirk: So, yes.

00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:54.740
The ID would represent
that string basically,

00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:58.230
but you kind of see a
little bit of a problem,

00:34:58.230 --> 00:35:00.840
because back when I was
trying to explain this before,

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:03.370
it's a blank node, and so
it's not necessarily something

00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:06.900
that is easy to find or reuse.

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:08.860
So one of the challenges
we have like in this case,

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:11.020
is this something we're
going to, you know,

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:13.420
we want to be able to
find again somehow?

00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:14.720
You might have to save it.

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:16.330
We might have to change
this from blank node

00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:21.280
to a different construction, where
it's like a...something local

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:24.010
to our system, but not
necessarily something you want

00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:25.530
to say everyone should
use, it's just something

00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:28.260
that we're using internally because
we thought it was a good idea.

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:30.750
Because otherwise you're going
to have to do this, you know,

00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:32.050
you're doing it one
time is one thing,

00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:33.480
but what if you're
doing it 100 times?

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:35.460
You know, what if there was 100
case studies you had to catalogue?

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:36.760 position:56%
Well that would be kind of annoying.

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:38.090
So you'd want to do this stuff.

00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:40.440 position:56%
So that's one of the things we've
been thinking about, in our systems,

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:42.010
how do we, you know, make
things a little bit easier

00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:44.220
by looking things up,
or choosing from lists,

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:47.300
or having defaults,
those kinds of things.

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:50.160
&gt;&gt; Paul: And so something long-term

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:53.750
that definitely the seed
could be planted in phase two,

00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:58.890
but something we might want to look
at in the long term is maybe a way

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:04.610
to know that one LCSH heading
has a certain authorized list

00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:06.310
of appropriate subdivisions.

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:10.470
So I'm not saying that we would
have to create an authority record,

00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:12.730
maybe we would eventually,
but wouldn't it be great

00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:15.200
if you could call up
that heading and see, oh,

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.040
which subdivision is appropriate?

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:20.410
Have a list come up, where you
could pick from that list, right?

00:36:20.410 --> 00:36:25.680 position:56%
So ways that we could sort of use
linked data, use the BIBFRAME editor

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:31.520
to improve on the way we can
describe resources using LCSH

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:33.750
when it comes to a
heading subdivision.

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:37.240
This is a long-term thing, and
it's one of those paradigm shifts

00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:38.540
in the way that we approach.

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:40.610
Now, free-floating subdivisions
have been around for a long time,

00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:43.820
and now I'm saying well maybe in
the future we might need to think

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:46.740
of another way and future
could be years, years ahead.

00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:50.970
But the BIBFRAME pilot phase one
brought this to our attention

00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:52.760
that hey, maybe there
is something we can do

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:57.020
to make this process a little
bit easier for cataloguers.

00:36:57.020 --> 00:37:05.830
So Kirk talked a little
bit about, in a way,

00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:08.400
that some was still a little
bit hard for me to understand,

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:11.700
about how he would create these
explicit lists of control terms

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:15.270
in id.loc.gov so the BIBFRAME
editor would look them up.

00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:17.160
Here're some examples here.

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:21.440
But I wanted to ask Kirk to talk
a little bit now about the value.

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:23.890
You know, as we look more
towards linked data sources,

00:37:23.890 --> 00:37:28.300
external vocabularies, internal
vocabularies, what value is there.

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:32.820
Is there an increasing value in
linking to an internal vocabulary?

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:35.070
Where you download an
external one internally

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:37.360
so you have a little bit
more control over it?

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:40.420
Or is the value more
in linking outside,

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:42.100
so we don't have to
duplicate the work?

00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:44.370
And I just wanted to see
what Kirk thought about that,

00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:46.840
from technology standpoint.

00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:53.790 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Kirk: I don't think it was one
of these three, but one little issue

00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:55.760
that we kind of run into is trust.

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:58.540
If you-in the linked data,
you can essentially link

00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:02.040
to other institutions'
data themselves,

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:03.880
so you don't necessarily
have to keep it internally.

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:05.180
So RDA is one example.

00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:10.040 position:56%
I mean, these lists that we have are
all on RDA's linked data service,

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:12.270 position:56%
and we could theoretically use them.

00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:15.730
One little issue is that
they're not exactly consumable,

00:38:15.730 --> 00:38:17.030
at least in the past.

00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:20.920 position:56%
They're not consumable, the way that
we were doing it, in our system,

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:23.450
so they're a little
technologically behind.

00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:26.860
It was still usable, but it
was just a little bit off.

00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:29.370
Mostly because they didn't
really have a searching,

00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:31.930
they didn't have an index,
they just have the documents.

00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:35.770 position:56%
So it's all-you almost have to cache
them, to be somewhat inefficient,

00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:39.160
a second reason we kind
of want it internally is

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:41.840
because we could use our
own infrastructure to do it,

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:43.860
then we don't have to worry
about what happens over there.

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:47.060
There actually was an example
where Paul told me about a list,

00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:49.750
I implemented it, it didn't
work because it didn't work.

00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:52.820
It was actually the RDA
list had some errors,

00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:54.550
and we actually had to
correct it ourselves.

00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:57.060
And I had to tell him
about it, you know,

00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:59.580
so we all make mistakes,
we're all new at this.

00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:03.990
So that's one of the reasons we've
actually been like importing data

00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:05.750
into the id.loc.gov, system.

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:08.970
Because that way we are in control
of it, we can make sure it works.

00:39:08.970 --> 00:39:10.270
When someone says something
is wrong,

00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:12.350
we have control over
it, we can fix it.

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:16.180
But in the future, I think we
are going to have, you know,

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:17.480
some things are going
to be external.

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:19.600
We are going to allow people in
profiles to say you know what?

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.160
There is this other
term that is useful

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:24.310
to my particular format
that I'm working on.

00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:27.810
It's not an ID, but it's
from someone we trust,

00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:29.110
and we'll go ahead and use it.

00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:31.310
So that is one of the
things that will happen.

00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:34.530
The same thing with our records,
I mean, one of the promises is

00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:39.480
that we'll work on something, we'll
have a description for a resource

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:43.620
of some kind, and it will be there,
then people can just link to it.

00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:47.340
They don't need to actually do copy
cataloguing, essentially, you know,

00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:49.600
you have to go through and copy
every single piece of information

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:51.610
or make sure it's valid, you
can simply say you know what?

00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:55.010
It has this number,
this URI, and it's that,

00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:56.970
that's what we're looking for.

00:39:56.970 --> 00:39:59.840
So we'll hopefully get
there, but we're still early,

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:02.470
still new at this, and
everything is up in the air.

00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:08.030
The technology is, in some
ways, it changes so fast

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:09.330
that we can't keep up with it.

00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:11.370
Other times it's like
we're inventing it

00:40:11.370 --> 00:40:13.700
at the same time we're doing it.

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:16.850
Sometimes we find out we're a
little bit behind, and we get told

00:40:16.850 --> 00:40:19.950
by other people in the community
that we need to step up our game

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:21.310
and stop doing something

00:40:21.310 --> 00:40:23.790
that we thought was-some
other group had told us

00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:27.140
that was exactly the right way
to do it [laughter], so you know,

00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:29.040
we're all these different
directions.

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:31.380
So that's-I think we've
been doing a lot better,

00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:34.840
and we have all these relationships
with other universities

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:37.380
that are working on the linked
data for production project,

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:41.610
which really is trying to kind
of work on these things where,

00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:43.700
you know, we have things
we actually work

00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:48.520
on to make our systems
provide resources for users.

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:50.690
So we need to actually make it
work, and how do we make it work?

00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:52.920
Well we need to make
production systems.

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:54.220
How do we make production systems?

00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:58.150
Well we have examples of things we
need to do, and we implement those.

00:40:58.150 --> 00:41:01.080
So that's something we're
working on the next two years,

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:05.500
and I think that's something that
is going to push us a lot further,

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:09.240
a lot closer to really using
linked data for everything.

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:15.250
&gt;&gt; Paul: Okay so this is-we're
going to share, this is more

00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:18.020
or less an introduction to
Sally's part of the presentation,

00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:21.280
but we want to talk about our view

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:23.200
of the next steps,
based on phase one.

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:26.430
We want to continue to analyze
the data that Beacher mentioned,

00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:29.810
all the descriptions are out
there, we can still look at them.

00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:33.080
They're in vocabulary
1, but they're useful.

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:35.410
We want to address the
community review a BIBFRAME,

00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:38.600
the vocabulary 2.0,
which is relatively new.

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:40.160
Hasn't been out that long.

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:44.920
Except for other control
vocabularies, you want to read any

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:46.400
of these or should I
just read them off?

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:47.700
&gt;&gt; Kirk: Go for it.

00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:49.540
&gt;&gt; Paul: Okay, take lessons
learned from phase one [laughter]

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:52.230
into account as we
work on the profiles,

00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:54.380
you know, this is our wish list.

00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:58.270
For how can the editor be
improved for the next phase?

00:41:58.270 --> 00:42:01.770
Refine some of the MARC mappings
that we had, and capitalize

00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:03.740
on the positive achievements,
and there were a lot

00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:05.040
of positive achievements.

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:09.080
There were some rough bumps
along the road too in phase one,

00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:11.720
but we're capitalizing on
the positive achievements

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:15.020
from phase one, as we
look toward phase two.

00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:18.900
So now, Sally McCallum will
talk about the visionary future

00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:22.590 position:56%
of what needs to be in place before
we can even contemplate starting the

00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:28.510
next phase of the BIBFRAME pilot.

00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:34.960
[ Applause ]

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:38.570
&gt;&gt; Sally: Thank you, and that
was an excellent introduction.

00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:42.770
This is sort of the eight-step
program, eight-step project,

00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:48.620
to get to the next pilot,
and it is a huge undertaking.

00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:52.670
And the first one, the first thing
we had to do was work on the model,

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:54.220
and how did we want
to change the model?

00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:58.060
How did we want to change the
vocabulary for the next pilot,

00:42:58.060 --> 00:43:01.640
and that is 2.0, in other
words, BIBFRAME 2.0.

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:05.180
We had a lot of input
on 1.0 since 2014.

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:09.810
We've had community-wide input
on get help, we had something

00:43:09.810 --> 00:43:13.370
like 200 comments that came
in, we reviewed all those.

00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:16.510
On the listserv, we had
more than 200 comments.

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:18.690
And somebody sort of
distilled all those,

00:43:18.690 --> 00:43:22.410
to see if there was a whole
lot of listserv comments,

00:43:22.410 --> 00:43:29.290 position:56%
can maybe yield one really pithy
comment, but still, it was important

00:43:29.290 --> 00:43:32.670
to pick out what we could use.

00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:33.990
We had some expert advice.

00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:39.480 position:56%
We had a consultant or two do some
work for us, and review some things,

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:41.190
parts of what we were doing.

00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:43.380
We had the pilot experience.

00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:47.080
And the things that the
additions that were made

00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:49.760
to those profiles,
during the first pilot.

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:54.920
Those-what those additions
said is those are missing

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:57.280
in the vocabulary 1.0.

00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:00.750
We have Program for
Cooperative Cataloguing comments.

00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:06.480
We had the LD4P comments, and those
are-that's the cooperative project

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:12.020
between, among rather, Stanford,
Harvard, Cornell, Princeton,

00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:15.590
Columbia, and the Library
of Congress.

00:44:15.590 --> 00:44:20.370
They are funded participants,
and we are unfunded participant,

00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:25.080
but they wanted us in their
pilot, in their program.

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:27.120
And they gave us a lot of comments.

00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:29.060
And they're still giving
us comments.

00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:33.720
We had the audiovisual media study
that we had, we commissioned,

00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:38.330
from some audiovisual specialists
who worked with the people

00:44:38.330 --> 00:44:45.310
at Culpeper, on it, and it gave
us a new view of an important area

00:44:45.310 --> 00:44:50.110
that we have incorporated into 2.0,
and then we have proposal papers

00:44:50.110 --> 00:44:53.310
for key areas, for titles,
for agents and roles,

00:44:53.310 --> 00:44:56.100
and there were a number of these.

00:44:56.100 --> 00:45:00.010
And we put them out and
left them out for comment,

00:45:00.010 --> 00:45:04.950
put them out on the listserv, I'm
sorry-put them out on the website,

00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:07.960
announced them on the listserv,
and got comments on them

00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:10.510
for about three or four months.

00:45:10.510 --> 00:45:14.830
So the initial model, 1.0, was
simple and innovative, we thought.

00:45:14.830 --> 00:45:21.050
It had works, the key areas,
works, instances and annotations

00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:23.910
for your holdings, for your
cover art, for things like that.

00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:25.990
Very interesting idea.

00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:31.050
And if you could see the screen,
I'm not sure you can, of the Works,

00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:35.180
you have agents and
something else-creators.

00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:39.480
Creators and subjects, and off
of instances, you have things

00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:42.270
like the publication
and the typical things

00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:47.220
that are related to
instances of works.

00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:52.520
So our 2.0 model is fundamentally
the same, but we had a couple

00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:56.100
of adjustments that make the
picture look a little different.

00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:57.430
We clarified events.

00:45:57.430 --> 00:46:00.950
And events can be content.

00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:05.920
So they can be-the works
can have content of event.

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:08.280 position:56%
They can also have subject of event,

00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:11.020
and those are two different-really
different concepts

00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:14.100
to the audiovisual
people, and so we tried

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:16.500
to incorporate that into the model.

00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:20.270
We have-we added items
as a core class,

00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:22.970
rather than calling
it-using annotations

00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:25.460
as a substitute for item.

00:46:28.170 --> 00:46:29.470
Now, the vocabulary.

00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:31.420
We had a good introduction
to the fact

00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:36.110
that what we call the
vocabulary in BIBFRAME is.

00:46:36.110 --> 00:46:39.550
It's similar to the MARC
fields and subfields.

00:46:39.550 --> 00:46:45.140
MARC vocabulary is 260-input
screen said probably 260.

00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:48.010
BIBFRAME vocabulary are
single words and phrases

00:46:48.010 --> 00:46:52.170
such as provision activity,
which is the same as a 260.

00:46:52.170 --> 00:46:55.490
And, but on the input screen,
you can do anything you want .

00:46:55.490 --> 00:47:00.520
And that is what Kirk and
Paul tried to make clear,

00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:06.620
that we have more control over
what we actually use with respect

00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:09.670
to the cataloguing environment,
and the input environment,

00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:12.650
and we are using that control

00:47:12.650 --> 00:47:16.850
to make it a better
environment than we had before.

00:47:16.850 --> 00:47:22.130
Not that you didn't all
learn what a 260 and 245

00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:26.540
and 350 and 300 and so on were.

00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:30.490
In the vocabulary,
we also have rules.

00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:31.920
We had to decide on.

00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:35.620
And one-the first one was
we decided to continue

00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:41.580
to use the resource description
framework, RDF, for the vocabulary.

00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:46.360
MARC itself is, well,
you have a lot of tags,

00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:51.590 position:56%
which is like the vocabulary, you
also have an underlying set of rules

00:47:51.590 --> 00:47:57.680
for how you express that, and that
is called ISO2709, it's a standard

00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:01.160
that just gives the
platform for how you do,

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:04.490
how you express that vocabulary.

00:48:04.490 --> 00:48:06.470
And we decided we would go ahead

00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:12.190
with the W3C resource description
framework, because it is sort

00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:15.810
of the basis for linked
data, and it is supported

00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:19.250
by the World Wide Web Consortia,
rather than by just library groups.

00:48:19.250 --> 00:48:25.710 position:56%
You can see there are some examples
of conventions we adopted, which may

00:48:25.710 --> 00:48:29.610
or may not mean very much, but
the distinction between data type

00:48:29.610 --> 00:48:32.430
and object type is very
important in RDA and RDF.

00:48:32.430 --> 00:48:39.870 position:56%
You had to be able to do your label,
the text version of something.

00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:43.220
You also wanted to be able to
have the URI at the same time,

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:45.960
and we had to make it
so that could happen.

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:53.810
And various other things that
are very...they're aspects

00:48:53.810 --> 00:48:55.320
or characteristics of RDF.

00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:58.340
We had to make choices on.

00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:02.970
And so the holdings annotation
became the item core class.

00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:07.690
Authorities in the new vocabulary
became agents and concepts.

00:49:07.690 --> 00:49:12.430
We don't use the word authority
so much, because we use agents,

00:49:12.430 --> 00:49:14.570
which are the persons,
organizations we use [inaudible],

00:49:14.570 --> 00:49:17.840
and we use concepts
which are topics, places,

00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:20.660
times, events, and works.

00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:23.200
And then we have better
accommodation

00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:25.280
of standardized vocabulary,
we think,

00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:29.320
and pre-text vocabulary,
and real-world objects.

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:35.290
The community went very
crazy about the distinction

00:49:35.290 --> 00:49:37.510
between real-world
object and the label

00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:41.070
of a real-world object,
a couple of years ago.

00:49:41.070 --> 00:49:43.690
And it's a valid distinction,

00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:46.710
whether-and it can be
used for various things.

00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:51.310 position:56%
It's not tremendously useful, but
it can be used to make certain kinds

00:49:51.310 --> 00:49:52.920
of inferences about things.

00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:57.440
And so we made it a better
distinction between those two.

00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:00.290
And most of all, we have a
better accommodation of RDA.

00:50:00.290 --> 00:50:06.670
That vocabulary 1.0 was a
mixture of MARC and RDA.

00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:09.100
MARC, AACR and RDA.

00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:16.190
Whereas the new vocabulary is much
more-it's planned, it's organized,

00:50:16.190 --> 00:50:21.560
within the RDA, organization,
like the RDA organization,

00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:24.610
and it uses a lot of RDA.

00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:28.480
We did finish that in April.

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:31.740 position:56%
We published the model and the
vocabulary, and it is the foundation

00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:33.040
of everything we do in the pilot.

00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:36.510
So these things, these steps
come one after another,

00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:40.210
and they are dependent
on the earlier steps.

00:50:40.210 --> 00:50:44.270
The second one is the-the
second step is the MARC

00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:48.840
to BIBFRAME conversion, which
is a very difficult task.

00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:53.360
We did make a commitment in the
first pilot, and we've had one

00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:56.930
in the second pilot, we hope to
do it better, to bring forward all

00:50:56.930 --> 00:51:00.650
of the MARC data, so that
cataloguers, when they are trying

00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:03.820
to create a record in BIBFRAME,
can look at the whole body

00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:10.450
of the catalogue in BIBFRAME, and
then decide what they want to do.

00:51:10.450 --> 00:51:12.670
And because that's the way
cataloguers have been working

00:51:12.670 --> 00:51:14.110
and how they should work.

00:51:14.110 --> 00:51:17.740
But there are vast
differences from MARC.

00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:19.290
And we had to, first of all,

00:51:19.290 --> 00:51:21.880
we had to identify
patterns in the MARC data.

00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:25.980
But we have to deal with the
things in MARC, because MARC grew

00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:32.850
over years, over 40 years,
and one community wanted this,

00:51:32.850 --> 00:51:34.420
another community wanted that.

00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:36.310
They were similar, but they
claim they were different,

00:51:36.310 --> 00:51:37.640
so we do both of them.

00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:41.210
Things like that have
elaborated MARC.

00:51:41.210 --> 00:51:44.290
There is a variety of approaches,
sometimes you have statements,

00:51:44.290 --> 00:51:46.650
sometimes you have codes,
sometimes you have control terms,

00:51:46.650 --> 00:51:47.950
sometimes you have text.

00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:51.570
You have all sorts
of things in MARC.

00:51:51.570 --> 00:51:55.870
You have the extent of MARC,
which even though we were trying

00:51:55.870 --> 00:51:59.310
to follow RDA and RDA,
the RDA model,

00:51:59.310 --> 00:52:03.620 position:56%
to some extent-we have acquisitions,
and subjects, and shelving location,

00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:07.350
and preservation information
in MARC, that is not in RDA.

00:52:07.350 --> 00:52:10.660
So it's not going to-RDA is not
going to tell us anything about how

00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:12.690
to structure the vocabulary
or what we need

00:52:12.690 --> 00:52:16.740
in the vocabulary for those areas.

00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:20.990 position:56%
We have a duplication of data, and
that is the thing, one of the things

00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:24.730
that has proliferated over
time, is we have codes,

00:52:24.730 --> 00:52:26.550
and this-we have the
same thing in text form.

00:52:26.550 --> 00:52:29.950
We have the same thing maybe
in controlled vocabulary form.

00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:33.650
We do that a lot in MARC.

00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:36.780
We did it from the very
beginning, let me say,

00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:40.220
but we did it increasingly
as time went on.

00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:41.600
And we have local data.

00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:47.940 position:56%
We have a lot of important local
data in MARC that we have to record,

00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:50.880
we have to be able to
show it to cataloguers

00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:56.520 position:56%
so that they can understand what
they're looking at from a technical,

00:52:56.520 --> 00:53:01.380
from a cataloguing point of view.

00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:04.410
We have to identify, we have
to have the identification

00:53:04.410 --> 00:53:05.860
of the URIs while possible.

00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:09.730
So we may bring a code forward,
we want to look up that code

00:53:09.730 --> 00:53:14.980
in ID then, get a URI for it, and
substitute that URI for that code.

00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:17.640
And as you know, we have a
lot of coded data in MARC.

00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:22.100
Even controlled terms, we want
to take the controlled term,

00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:25.630
we want to look it up in ID,
we want to have a URI instead

00:53:25.630 --> 00:53:30.910
of that term, in our
RDF descriptions.

00:53:30.910 --> 00:53:35.730 position:56%
We call them descriptions when we
talk about RDF, rather than records.

00:53:35.730 --> 00:53:38.560
Then the various RDF
techniques, we have to figure

00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:46.020 position:56%
out how we-there are several ways
you can usually do something in RDF.

00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:48.520
We have to decide okay we're going
to do it this way, and we're going

00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:52.290
to do it consistently this way,
rather than doing it this way

00:53:52.290 --> 00:53:54.010
for this data, and
that way for that data,

00:53:54.010 --> 00:53:55.540
and that way for another
kind of data.

00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:58.980
So we want-we are trying
to keep things consistent,

00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:01.140
and we want to eventually
make it shareable.

00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:05.690
The conversion specs are almost
finished, and we have a consultant,

00:54:05.690 --> 00:54:10.640
we have employed a consultant
who knows a lot about MARC,

00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:13.010
and a lot about linked data,

00:54:13.010 --> 00:54:17.120
who is going to do the-write the
actual programs for the conversion.

00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:21.700
Step three, MARC to BIBFRAME
conversion program, we create,

00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:25.360
we need to create the
conversions of the test programs.

00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:27.980
We need to create a conversion
service for the community

00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:29.970
for experimentation if possible.

00:54:29.970 --> 00:54:35.060
And that actually seems like a
little extra that we shouldn't have

00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:38.810
to do, but it is very useful
and we found it very useful

00:54:38.810 --> 00:54:43.730 position:56%
with the 1.0 vocabulary, because the
people in the community got right

00:54:43.730 --> 00:54:47.970
on it, converted records that took
this converter, convert records,

00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:49.840
and try to give us feedback.

00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:53.360
And that is more than,
you know, we can get even

00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:55.050
from our own cataloguers.

00:54:55.050 --> 00:54:56.640
We got it from across the country.

00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:58.490
So it's very, very important.

00:54:58.490 --> 00:55:02.020
And we want to share those
programs that, we always do share,

00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:05.640
and we always try to share.

00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:08.490 position:56%
Step four, preparation of the files.

00:55:08.490 --> 00:55:13.090
We have to take the-and this is
a big, this is a huge project,

00:55:13.090 --> 00:55:17.630
part of the project, we have to
take the MARC title authorities,

00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:20.300
and they become BIBFRAME works.

00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:21.600
Work descriptions.

00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:24.900
We have to take the bib
records with uniform titles,

00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:27.610
match them with these work
records, and merge them

00:55:27.610 --> 00:55:29.080
into the work description.

00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:32.170
So we have these match and
merge, match and merge.

00:55:32.170 --> 00:55:37.190
We have MARC records with uniform
titles, but no authority record,

00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:39.740
which there are many of those.

00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:41.680
And we have to create a work.

00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:44.870
So we have to distinguish between
those that have uniform titles,

00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:47.260
and no authority, and those
that have uniform titles

00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:53.440 position:56%
and do have an authority, so that we
can create a BIBFRAME work record.

00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:56.870
We have to take MARC bib records
that are without uniform titles,

00:55:56.870 --> 00:56:01.370
and there, we can create a
BIBFRAME work description.

00:56:01.370 --> 00:56:05.510
Then we have to merge the
subjects from the BIBFRAME,

00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:08.540
from the MARC records, into
the BIBFRAME work descriptions,

00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:09.970
and consolidate the subjects.

00:56:09.970 --> 00:56:14.740
If there is more than
one MARC record that goes

00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:18.580
to one BIBFRAME work record, we
have to take the subjects from both

00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:21.660
of them, merge those in some
way, and put them together,

00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:24.700
and put them on the work record.

00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:29.330
And then the MARC bibs, we
finally-what's left, we have to go,

00:56:29.330 --> 00:56:31.620
after we've taken all
the work information off,

00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:34.060
we have to split the instances.

00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:38.310
And that is very difficult, because
of the way we've done that in MARC

00:56:38.310 --> 00:56:44.250 position:56%
over time, and that we tried to sort
of push in different instance types

00:56:44.250 --> 00:56:48.380
into one record, because
it helped with our systems.

00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:51.180
Our systems worked that way.

00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:55.430
And so we do have-we want
to try to split those off,

00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:57.140
then, in the new environment.

00:56:57.140 --> 00:57:01.150
Which is, again, that's RDA, and
the way RDA would like for it

00:57:01.150 --> 00:57:06.980
to see a structure and model
bibliographic data for, they think,

00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:09.220
a better user experience.

00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:14.760
And while we're doing this, we want
to keep pointers among the new work

00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:16.480
and instance records
and descriptions

00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:19.710 position:56%
so that these things don't fragment.

00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:21.030
Step five.

00:57:21.030 --> 00:57:24.490
We've got to prepare the-we've
had to prepare the infrastructure,

00:57:24.490 --> 00:57:28.500
and that's been ongoing
since, oh, last year actually.

00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:37.920 position:56%
We use the-and this is the hard core
platform, this is what Nate Trail,

00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:44.250
in our office, is a person
who handles this the most.

00:57:44.250 --> 00:57:46.560
That's his focus, let's say.

00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:51.300
The LC uses the MARC
object platform.

00:57:51.300 --> 00:57:52.790
We've had a major move

00:57:52.790 --> 00:57:55.050
of the platform internally
to virtual servers.

00:57:55.050 --> 00:58:00.390
Now, we have accomplished
that with difficulty,

00:58:00.390 --> 00:58:03.590
but with very good
assistance from OCIO,

00:58:03.590 --> 00:58:06.110
from the newly reorganized OCIO.

00:58:06.110 --> 00:58:09.910
We have had a major version upgrade
of the platform, with the addition

00:58:09.910 --> 00:58:11.340
of a new semantic module.

00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:12.640
We have done that.

00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:17.690 position:56%
We've got that in place, but we have
not got all the data loaded to it.

00:58:17.690 --> 00:58:21.800
Because we need to have lots less
movement, then, of all the data

00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:25.420
that we have in the old version,
and the old linked data service

00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:27.780
into the new linked data
service, without interruption.

00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:32.880
And this is not-I mean,
while the pilot uses ID,

00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:37.680
the linked data service,
the community uses it a lot.

00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:41.490
There are peak times when there
are several million hits a day

00:58:41.490 --> 00:58:44.800
on that service, and other
times when it's more like two

00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:46.120
or three hundred thousand.

00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:48.260 position:56%
But it's always very intensely used.

00:58:48.260 --> 00:58:53.630
People have gotten-they-the linked
data service has been in operation

00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:58.190
for one vocabulary, then
two, and three, four, five,

00:58:58.190 --> 00:59:03.160
for the last six years,
because it came up in 2010.

00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:07.960
And so a lot of people,
a lot of systems people

00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:12.660
out there have started using
it to update their systems,

00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:16.110
to get information, to get
current information from us.

00:59:16.110 --> 00:59:22.000
So we-and when it goes down,
they let us know [laughter].

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:27.300
So we have to do that without
interruption, and then we have

00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:34.490
to plan and load the new, revise
the re-converted BIBFRAME files,

00:59:34.490 --> 00:59:36.300
in this new semantic environment.

00:59:36.300 --> 00:59:40.980
And we had a different kind of
semantic environment before.

00:59:40.980 --> 00:59:45.240
Step six, we have to
revise the BIBFRAME editor

00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:46.670
and the BIBFRAME profile editor.

00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:49.270
And you've heard a lot
about that this morning,

00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:54.320
more than what I would
be ready to say,

00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:56.720
review and revise editor
functionality,

00:59:56.720 --> 01:00:00.030
and revise the interface labels.

01:00:00.030 --> 01:00:02.770
I think they told you,
Paul, I think,

01:00:02.770 --> 01:00:07.250
told you about how the labels
were designed for the interface,

01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:10.650
and he has, I'm sure,
ideas on how he wants

01:00:10.650 --> 01:00:13.500
to redesign or revise those labels.

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:16.450
Based on what his interactions
with the cataloguers,

01:00:16.450 --> 01:00:20.750
in the pilot-we have a lot to do,

01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:23.670
and we have to make this
available to the community.

01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:26.010
We have to rebuild the
links between the editor

01:00:26.010 --> 01:00:29.270
and the actual vocabulary.

01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:34.100
Step seven, review and augment
the linked data service.

01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:36.580
It's an integral part of the pilot,

01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:40.670
so we want the editor-it provides
the editor with its drop downs,

01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:43.510
with its look ahead information,
with all sorts of things,

01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:48.820
and while I've talked earlier
about the outward use of it,

01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:51.580
it's also a very heavy
inward use of it,

01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:56.260 position:56%
for the BIBFRAME, and for the pilot.

01:00:56.260 --> 01:01:00.020
It provides the URIs for the data,
during our preparation stage,

01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:02.370
when we're preparing the files.

01:01:02.370 --> 01:01:04.300
We need to redesign
this application,

01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:09.270
move it to MarkLogic,
and augment it.

01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:11.390
And finally, step eight.

01:01:11.390 --> 01:01:12.690
A very big one.

01:01:12.690 --> 01:01:17.180
It was excellently done for the
first pilot, and that's the work

01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:24.270
that COIN does for preparing the
materials, training material,

01:01:24.270 --> 01:01:27.320
holding retraining sessions,
holding new training sessions.

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:31.850
They had an excellent-did
an excellent job of setting

01:01:31.850 --> 01:01:36.140 position:56%
up feedback mechanisms, so that-and
giving cataloguers constant support,

01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:38.810
so that I think it was every
week or every couple of weeks,

01:01:38.810 --> 01:01:42.710 position:56%
they had a session that you can
come if you're having trouble, come,

01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:46.380
if you don't have trouble, you can
just continue to work that day.

01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:50.950
So they did a lot of work
to prepare the documentation

01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:53.020
and to hold training,
and to hold the hands

01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:57.810
of the people during the pilot.

01:01:57.810 --> 01:02:02.680
So part of-we're starting a
wish list for the new pilot.

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:07.450
I think a few, Kirk and Paul,
made a few comments on that.

01:02:07.450 --> 01:02:10.470
We would like to have daily
conversion of the BIBFRAME,

01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:13.830
to BIBFRAME, and load of
the new bib descriptions,

01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:19.110
with the first pilot we could not
have daily load of bib records.

01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:22.370
We had daily load of authority
records that were coming

01:02:22.370 --> 01:02:26.600
into the ILS, and then coming into
BIBFRAME, but not bib records.

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:32.320
There is a major undertaking, major
challenge, to be able to do that.

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:34.740
Because you've got to
do this merge and match

01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:38.950
when you bring any one
record into this set

01:02:38.950 --> 01:02:41.670
of records that is already there.

01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:46.870
And we would like to have an input
editor for names, and for subjects,

01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:50.640
so that people could have an
experience of what it's like to try

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:54.410
to do their names, and their
subjects, authorities essentially.

01:02:54.410 --> 01:02:56.170
I've used that word,
but I'm not supposed to.

01:02:56.170 --> 01:03:00.760 position:56%
But at any rate, those descriptions,

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:07.290
in the right-in the environment
they're doing their Bib record in.

01:03:07.290 --> 01:03:13.810
So take away from this, what I
said, Keystone is the vocabulary.

01:03:13.810 --> 01:03:15.850 position:56%
We're having some trouble with that,

01:03:15.850 --> 01:03:19.190
but if the vocabulary
keeps changing,

01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:21.440
then we have to keep changing
all these things, all the way up,

01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:25.200
including the documentation
for the training.

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:31.220
And all other caches are dependent
on it, therefore on its stability.

01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:35.630
But we see the pilots as essential
for understanding what we're going

01:03:35.630 --> 01:03:39.550
into for the migration of
MARC to the new platform,

01:03:39.550 --> 01:03:44.880
which we've done a lot of work
trying to make that as good

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:50.630
as possible, because we have 50,
100 years of cataloging information

01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:55.210
that we can't lose and we must
be able to bring it forward.

01:03:55.210 --> 01:03:58.540
And it also, we see this
as part of understanding,

01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:01.770
how we make libraries a part
of the linked data environment.

questions to any and all of us.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.270
We'll just start [inaudible].

01:04:21.270 --> 01:04:25.740
&gt;&gt; Is the intention to be able
to save the records this time,

01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:28.260
so that it can be used
to [inaudible] be there,

01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:37.380
like in the first pilot,
and not be able [inaudible]?

01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:38.770
&gt;&gt; Well all need to stand up?

01:04:38.770 --> 01:04:40.400
&gt;&gt; Yes.

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:43.320
&gt;&gt; Well someone who
is going to answer.

01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:45.270
&gt;&gt; I think a better thing
to think of, actually,

01:04:45.270 --> 01:04:48.480
is that the editor was just
an input screen initially.

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:49.860
It doesn't do anything.

01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:53.650
And so is that useful
for production?

01:04:53.650 --> 01:04:56.760
Well no. Because you need to do
things like you're mentioning.

01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:59.140
So then what do you need for that?

01:04:59.140 --> 01:05:01.700
You need a bunch of things behind
the scenes, to make it all work.

01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:03.340
And so that's what
Sally was talking about.

01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:06.030
It's part of getting all the
stuff behind the scenes working.

01:05:06.030 --> 01:05:08.960
We're going to have whatever
the editor is called in 2.0,

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:11.330
I'm leaning toward renaming
it something completely,

01:05:11.330 --> 01:05:17.070 position:56%
because it's going to be really a
part of a prototype ILS like system,

01:05:17.070 --> 01:05:20.270
rather than just simply an editor

01:05:20.270 --> 01:05:22.110
where you can just
type things in fields.

01:05:22.110 --> 01:05:27.310 position:56%
So it will have saving, and we're
really hopeful we'll have a lot more

01:05:27.310 --> 01:05:30.950
features, not just
entering descriptions.

01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:34.330
Like Paul said, we've
always had this hope

01:05:34.330 --> 01:05:37.190
that you can do a lot more
things, like authority work.

01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:39.910
And so that's another thing
I think we don't want to do.

01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:42.940
So you could actually go into
an ID record, for a name,

01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:46.170
actually open it up, and maybe make
a change to it and save it back

01:05:46.170 --> 01:05:47.700
into ID, into our system.

01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:51.000
I think that's one thing we'd also
like to do, because I think that's,

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.620
and then that would somehow flow
into the Voyager system, somehow.

01:05:54.620 --> 01:05:57.820
I mean that would be
like years in the future,

01:05:57.820 --> 01:05:59.120
we might actually do that.

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:02.730
But that's one of the ideas.

01:06:02.730 --> 01:06:04.030
&gt;&gt; Jada?

here because we are being filmed.

in those directions as opposed
to working on its own to sort

of parallel some of these efforts?

01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:02.570
&gt;&gt; Beacher: Well I don't-I think
as several of us have said,

01:07:02.570 --> 01:07:07.650
we are collaborating and
working with various constituents

01:07:07.650 --> 01:07:10.400
in the community, and
we are, and have been,

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:16.910
working with Deborah Fritz, and
company, and I'm on the RDA Board,

01:07:16.910 --> 01:07:25.550
and the RDA Board has, I think it's
fair to say, adopted [inaudible]

01:07:25.550 --> 01:07:29.750
as one of the paths
it wants to take.

01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:33.990 position:56%
I know Paul and Judith in particular
have worked with Deborah and several

01:07:33.990 --> 01:07:38.710
of the ALA Meetings, to see
how these come together,

01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:41.510
and it was also part
of what we discussed

01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:44.340
at the OpCo meeting in May.

01:07:44.340 --> 01:07:47.780
Paul or Judith, do you have
further elaboration on that?

01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:51.270
Or even Sally or Kirk,
beyond the fact

01:07:51.270 --> 01:07:56.100
that we are taking
those into account?

01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:57.690
&gt;&gt; I think it's a good question.

01:07:57.690 --> 01:07:59.820
It's a valid question.

01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:04.650 position:56%
But from my perspective, we're still
so new at this, that there needs

01:08:04.650 --> 01:08:10.070 position:56%
to be a lot of experimentation still
among different constituents before

01:08:10.070 --> 01:08:12.500
we all come together
and agree on something.

01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:14.730
We have used Deborah's
product, the RIMMF,

01:08:14.730 --> 01:08:18.190
and I think we had a very
productive demonstration of how

01:08:18.190 --> 01:08:21.850
that could be used to
display visualize RDA,

01:08:21.850 --> 01:08:24.390 position:56%
and then we use the BIBFRAME editor.

01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:26.780
That's the type of experimentation
that I still think needs

01:08:26.780 --> 01:08:29.110
to take place before we
actually, you know, buckle down

01:08:29.110 --> 01:08:34.720
and say this is the
way we're going to go.

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:37.520
&gt;&gt; One of the things that I
think LD4P is really focusing

01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:40.740
on is partnering with each
other, working with each other

01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:43.090
on strengths and weaknesses.

01:08:43.090 --> 01:08:47.360
The RIMMF editor is as far as
I know a Visual BASIC doc type

01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:50.310
which is not very popular
in the library community.

01:08:50.310 --> 01:08:52.060
It's closed source.

01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:53.360
It's not open source.

01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:54.660
These are about open source.

01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:57.170
It's the opposite, where it's
not accessible by anyone,

01:08:57.170 --> 01:08:59.060
certainly you could use it,
like they have a license,

01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:00.360 position:56%
where you can actually use the tool,

01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:02.800
but you can't make any changes
to it, as far as I know.

01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:07.990 position:56%
And so it becomes kind of
difficult while it's a great-I mean,

01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:10.670
it's been great for the
community, and people like it,

01:09:10.670 --> 01:09:14.070
but how can I integrate it
into our MarkLogic system?

01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:16.560
Well, it's not possible,
because it's in Visual BASIC,

01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:18.150
and that's not one of the options.

01:09:18.150 --> 01:09:21.700
And so certainly we could
port it to something else,

01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:24.570
but that would be a really large
effort to do that, and you know,

01:09:24.570 --> 01:09:25.880 position:56%
essentially that's what we're doing.

01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:29.770
So I am kind of disappointed
that's one of the cases

01:09:29.770 --> 01:09:31.070
with that particular tool,

01:09:31.070 --> 01:09:34.310
that it seems like we don't
really have them, you know,

01:09:34.310 --> 01:09:37.780
we don't have that in our
development community where,

01:09:37.780 --> 01:09:40.520
as far as I know, none of the
LD4P partners are thinking

01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:44.920
about RIMMF for, you know, porting
it or working with them at all.

01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:46.220
So that makes it difficult.

01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:49.720
As far as the vocabulary, I know
one thing that has come up before,

01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:54.610
and I think conversations, Sally
might hopefully be able to agree

01:09:54.610 --> 01:09:57.160
with me is that people
consider RDA's version

01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:59.700
of RDF is too complicated.

01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:03.140
It's like-there's obviously a
need for complicated vocabularies,

01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:04.440
because the world is complex.

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:05.740
So you need to have things.

01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:08.910 position:56%
But at the same time, if you look on
Google, what happens on the screen?

01:10:08.910 --> 01:10:11.810
Well, you know, you get a list
of gobbledy goop, you know,

01:10:11.810 --> 01:10:13.110
it's just a bunch of words.

01:10:13.110 --> 01:10:15.200
And certainly it seems behind
the scenes it does all sorts

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:18.810
of great things with their
keyword searches, but it's really,

01:10:18.810 --> 01:10:23.360
actually relatively simple, like
the amount of stuff they have.

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:28.500
And one that they've, you know,
ontology really prefer is,

01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:32.740
is [inaudible] which is a
lot flatter than BIBFRAME.

01:10:32.740 --> 01:10:35.960
It doesn't have a lot of classes,
but has lots of properties.

01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:38.200
And even those properties,
there's lots of possibilities,

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:42.280
but I think we were investigating
some of the implementations of that

01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:47.470
for library materials, and it
was like 8 or 10 properties.

01:10:47.470 --> 01:10:49.090
So it's pretty simple.

01:10:49.090 --> 01:10:54.590
If you look at something like, you
know Dublin core is used by DPLA,

01:10:54.590 --> 01:10:58.470
and Europeana, they have
about 20, 21 properties.

01:10:58.470 --> 01:11:01.020
I think I was telling Sally
about that the other day.

01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:03.090
So they're-they've dealt
with the complexity

01:11:03.090 --> 01:11:06.020
by making it less complex,
but because of that,

01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:09.290
it doesn't accept the range
of descriptions that a lot

01:11:09.290 --> 01:11:11.650
of times different
library communities want

01:11:11.650 --> 01:11:14.090
because they really do want to be
able to describe things in a lot

01:11:14.090 --> 01:11:16.940
of detail, and it could
be difficult to do

01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:19.720
that if you only have
21 property options.

01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:22.550
Of which about five or six I
think are just for the system.

01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:26.650
So. You know, that's one of the
things I think is a challenge.

01:11:26.650 --> 01:11:29.760
It's that is Google
going to adopt RDA?

01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:32.920
I don't think they even understand
it or know about it [laughter],

01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:36.640
and so, I know that's something
I worry about with BIBFRAME.

01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:38.880
Because BIBFRAME is still
complex, but I think we

01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:42.020
at least-our goal is to-we
want to be able to hook

01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:44.840
into these other things that
are maybe not as complex,

01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:49.660
but we have some, you know,
we're thinking about same

01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:51.860
as relationships, where you
can say it's the same as.

01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:53.950
So if you're searching in
one of those ontologies,

01:11:53.950 --> 01:11:57.040 position:56%
at least you can get some BIBFRAME,
and maybe as they get more BIBFRAME,

01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:59.460
it becomes more useful
and they see it's there.

01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:02.600
And if we have a big volume of it,
it's going to be useful to Google,

01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:05.190
and they're going to use some of
it, so that's one of the goals.

01:12:05.190 --> 01:12:06.490
So it's a challenge.

01:12:06.490 --> 01:12:08.230
I mean, not everything
works in technology.

01:12:08.230 --> 01:12:09.840
Maybe people succeed.

01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:12.740
Maybe RDA is better
than what, I mean,

01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:14.170
we're all doing experimentation.

01:12:14.170 --> 01:12:17.160
We are not quite there, but that's
one of the things I think about.

01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:18.930
So, good question.

01:12:18.930 --> 01:12:20.230
&gt;&gt; That's very helpful.

01:12:20.230 --> 01:12:21.530
&gt;&gt; Aaron?

01:12:21.530 --> 01:12:27.470
&gt;&gt; How is it with let's
say, distinguishing

01:12:27.470 --> 01:12:31.940
between let's say baseball,
in Australia, with Cricket,

01:12:31.940 --> 01:12:35.450
in the United States, you
know, the [inaudible]?

01:12:35.450 --> 01:12:40.190
Keyword searching, you don't have
the link between the subfield D

01:12:40.190 --> 01:12:44.710
and the subfield A, you would not
be able to distinguish that record

01:12:44.710 --> 01:12:48.660
from baseball in the
United States with cricket

01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:50.650 position:56%
in Australia, but [inaudible] works.

01:12:50.650 --> 01:12:54.990
The examples you show for subjects
don't seem to have the ability

01:12:54.990 --> 01:12:59.040
to break down fields,
eliminate subfields.

01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:02.690
Is there a commitment to preserve
the pre-coordination [inaudible]?

01:13:02.690 --> 01:13:06.070
I know RDA seems to be wanting

01:13:06.070 --> 01:13:09.510
to make sure [inaudible]
will accommodate RDA.

01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:13.380
Is there a similar commitment
to preserve LCSH and BIBFRAME?

01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:17.990
&gt;&gt; Well, definitely during phase
one, and most likely phase two,

01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:23.120 position:56%
as I said, cataloguers had to do
everything that they do now in MARC,

01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:26.430
in BIBFRAME, and the Library of
Congress has made a commitment

01:13:26.430 --> 01:13:29.560
to continue to pre-coordinate
LCSH strings,

01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:31.250
so that's why we were doing that.

01:13:31.250 --> 01:13:33.640
The point I was trying to
make is that what happens

01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:37.720
when that pre-coordinated string
is not matched by something

01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:39.850
that can retrieve it
again sometimes?

01:13:39.850 --> 01:13:46.160 position:56%
So yes, we definitely are continuing
LCSH as we're instructed to do now

01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:51.920
in BIBFRAME, and I know that will
continue into the next pilot.

01:13:53.130 --> 01:13:55.360

01:13:55.360 --> 01:14:02.390

okay, is the editor going to come

01:14:05.010 --> 01:14:12.130
in a new ILS, for instance,
[inaudible]?

01:14:12.130 --> 01:14:17.620 position:56%
Because I know that [inaudible] will
no longer be supported [inaudible]-

01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:19.200
&gt;&gt; That's not true.

01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:20.850
&gt;&gt; Oh it's not?

01:14:20.850 --> 01:14:23.730
Oh, okay [laughter], so I'm
still questioning what is coming

01:14:23.730 --> 01:14:27.500
for the next generation of
ILS's and different it is.

01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:29.970
&gt;&gt; Well, I'm probably the
last person who should answer

01:14:29.970 --> 01:14:32.860
that question, but I will say,
I'll confirm what Anne said,

01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:37.930
Voyager is supported, and right
now, we're not looking at BIBFRAME

01:14:37.930 --> 01:14:41.650
as a database of entry, I mean,
that's coming down the road.

01:14:41.650 --> 01:14:48.580
Maybe you all could add
some comments to that?

01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:52.230
&gt;&gt; Beacher: No, I think that's
not one that we will answer,

01:14:52.230 --> 01:14:56.740
and Anne said it succinctly,
she has responsibility for that,

01:14:56.740 --> 01:15:04.970
and she will be keeping all
of us apprised of her...foray

01:15:04.970 --> 01:15:11.560 position:56%
into replacement system for
Voyager, but now Voyager is Voyager,

01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:16.160
and BIBFRAME, we will overlay
on the system that we have.

01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:18.640
Questions in the back?

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:22.810
Since I have been starting
at the front?

01:15:22.810 --> 01:15:25.520
Any remaining questions?

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:33.100
If not, I know Judith has a
statement she wants to make,

01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:35.410
Sally is there anything
else you need to say?

01:15:35.410 --> 01:15:36.720
And my other colleagues?

01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:38.020
Okay. Judith?

01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:39.320
&gt;&gt; Judith: I just want
you all to know

01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:41.370
that I have Beacher's permission
to put on a series of sessions,

01:15:41.370 --> 01:15:43.710
probably in the dining room,

01:15:43.710 --> 01:15:46.010
I will find out when I
can get the dining rooms,

01:15:46.010 --> 01:15:50.770
and they will be an opportunity for
people that were not in the pilot

01:15:50.770 --> 01:15:52.520 position:56%
to have a closer look at the editor.

01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:54.240
It won't be hands on.

01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:56.710
I'll be calling on Les, and
Hien and Tim, and Manon,

01:15:56.710 --> 01:15:58.070
to provide this training.

01:15:58.070 --> 01:16:01.790
But I am curious, how many
of you would be interested

01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:06.600
in taking a closer look at the
editor, and what people that are

01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:08.850
in the pilot are seeing and doing?

01:16:08.850 --> 01:16:11.360
Because I know today it
was very difficult for you

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:13.630
to see the screens, but
there wasn't much we could do

01:16:13.630 --> 01:16:17.310
because it was being filmed,
and they need the light.

01:16:17.310 --> 01:16:19.360
So is it-what's the
level of interest?

01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:24.530
Oh good, well I'll start
with a couple of sessions.

01:16:24.530 --> 01:16:26.340
If I need more, I'll put on more.

01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:28.620
They'll probably last
a couple of hours,

01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:32.280
but it will give you an opportunity
to have a really good look

01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:37.060
at the editor, and see how
it's filled in by those

01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:39.930
that are working on the pilot.

01:16:39.930 --> 01:16:43.330
And when we finish phase 2,
I'll do the same for you,

01:16:43.330 --> 01:16:47.600
so that you can all keep current.

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:48.900
Alright. Yes?

01:16:48.900 --> 01:16:53.600
&gt;&gt; Could you be sure to include
Culpeper in that initiative?

01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:54.930
&gt;&gt; Okie dokey, we'll
do that [laughter].

01:16:54.930 --> 01:16:56.570
Yes. Sorry.

01:16:56.570 --> 01:16:58.880
&gt;&gt; Beacher: You can tell by
her face, you'll have to figure

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:00.180
out how she's going
to do that [laughter].

01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:01.480
&gt;&gt; Yes?

01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:07.370
&gt;&gt; I have a question
for, uh, Kirk and Paul.

01:17:07.370 --> 01:17:08.670
Did I get the name right?

01:17:08.670 --> 01:17:09.970
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:17:09.970 --> 01:17:12.860
&gt;&gt; And this must have been
with the authority creation,

01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:24.460
you said that there is a delay with
using the different editor in order

01:17:24.460 --> 01:17:31.480
to get a name that had
not been established,

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:46.860
then you can establish it,
and then it gets uploaded.

01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:53.840
But in the future, we're always
going to be referring to ID

01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:57.860
for doing all of our
creation of authority work,

01:17:57.860 --> 01:17:59.610
will there always be that delay?

01:17:59.610 --> 01:18:04.300
Is there some way to
make it more seamless?

01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:07.120
Is that something you're
thinking about?

01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:09.760
Is that something that has come up?

01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:14.690
&gt;&gt; Kirk: Judith told me I
have to repeat the question.

01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:19.710
I know the answer, but I'm trying
to think of what the question was.

01:18:19.710 --> 01:18:24.820
So that basically [laughter], you
have to basically think about,

01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:29.680
you know, obviously we're doing
things in MARC or Voyager,

01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:33.100
then we're porting it over to
ID, and then there is a delay,

01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:36.200 position:56%
because it takes a day or something,

01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:40.110
whereas we could just simply
enter it in ID and be there.

01:18:40.110 --> 01:18:42.410
And then it would go to Voyager,

01:18:42.410 --> 01:18:46.930
and probably could also be
a little bit more seamless.

01:18:46.930 --> 01:18:49.180
So yeah, I mean, I think
that's definitely one

01:18:49.180 --> 01:18:53.470
of the things you want
to do because, you know,

01:18:53.470 --> 01:18:55.430
especially with names,
I think that's one

01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:58.310
of the things we really could
accomplish, but you know,

01:18:58.310 --> 01:19:01.300
it takes some more effort
because it's kind of-uh, again,

01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:03.950
I might be overstepping my
bounds, but I feel like it's kind

01:19:03.950 --> 01:19:08.220
of stepping from experimental to
production, when we're you know,

01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:12.520 position:56%
I don't want to get yelled at, about
stepping into Voyager's domain,

01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:13.980
but basically that's
what would happen.

01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:20.780
We'd have to really push it into
their court, as something else,

01:19:20.780 --> 01:19:23.650
and that's another thing
they'd have to work on

01:19:23.650 --> 01:19:27.020
and maybe they're not staffed
for that right now, so you know,

01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:29.000
but we've got to-I think that's
one of the things we have to think

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.300
about as part of this pilot.

01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:31.600
It is that once we experiment with
names, maybe we can, you know,

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:32.900
in one of our test databases,

01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:34.200
we could actually enter things
immediately and then figure out how

01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:35.500
to generate, you know, MARC,
basically at the same time

01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:36.800
at that point, as maybe we
can change our processes.

01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:38.100 position:56%
So it's a little bit more efficient.

01:19:38.100 --> 01:19:39.400
And I think we can do more
with our linked data service

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:40.700 position:56%
than we can with the MARC authority.

01:19:40.700 --> 01:19:42.000
So maybe there are actually some
enhancements we can put there,

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:43.300
to make it a little
bit easier to use.

01:19:43.300 --> 01:19:44.600
So there is a lot of promise there.

01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:45.900
That's one of the things I hope
we get a lot of good information

01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:47.200
when we work on that,
our next pilot.

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:48.500
&gt;&gt; Beacher: Paul, did
you want to comment?

01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:49.800
&gt;&gt; Paul: Well, I can't
resist the opportunity.

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:51.100
Okay, so when Aaron asked his
question, I had to say that,

01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:52.400 position:56%
you know, we're making, we're saying
that cataloguers should not have

01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:53.700
to do anything differently.

01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:55.000
So I'm just going to say something.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.300
Think of a future, possibly

01:19:56.300 --> 01:19:57.600
where maybe you don't use just
the name authority file from LC,

01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:58.900
maybe you link to another
authority file?

01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:00.200
And then in another country,
another-something like that.

01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:01.500
That's what linked
data is all about.

01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:02.800
So that's where we're
thinking ahead,

01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:04.100
where we might-where there
might be possibilities

01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:05.400 position:56%
to change the way we do things now,
so I just had to put that out there.

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:06.700
&gt;&gt; Beacher: Mira?

01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:08.000
&gt;&gt; Mira: I just wanted to know

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.300
when do you anticipate
the next phase to begin?

01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:10.600
&gt;&gt; Beacher: Yes, that's what
I was going to wrap up with.

01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:12.520
I was amazed no one had
[laughter] raised that yet.

01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:17.200
As you heard from me earlier
in giving you the recap,

01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:21.660
I'm always pressing to go
faster, faster, more and more.

01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:27.250
My colleagues, and I think
Sally laid out a very strong

01:20:27.250 --> 01:20:33.230
and clear path to getting
to the next pilot.

01:20:33.230 --> 01:20:39.130
I wanted to start in the first
quarter of the new fiscal year.

01:20:39.130 --> 01:20:43.800
I think based on what you
heard today, it's fair to say,

01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:50.630
we will not have the next pilot
begin before January 2017.

01:20:50.630 --> 01:20:55.780
I want the technical side to
have the time to do the things

01:20:55.780 --> 01:21:02.030
that they need to do, so that
the next pilot is not as rushed

01:21:02.030 --> 01:21:06.610
and frantic as the first one,
and that there is more confidence

01:21:06.610 --> 01:21:10.480
in the stability of
both the vocabulary

01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:12.870
and the infrastructure
that will support that.

01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:16.660
So as of today, I think it's
fair to say that we're aiming

01:21:16.660 --> 01:21:22.870
for the second quarter of fiscal
2017, meaning not before January.

01:21:22.870 --> 01:21:26.760
In the interim, then, we'll
be having these sessions

01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:29.180
as we are having, similar to today,

01:21:29.180 --> 01:21:33.590
and the ones that Judith just
described in terms of giving those

01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:35.770
of you who are not
necessarily involved

01:21:35.770 --> 01:21:39.400
in the pilot now a better
sense of what the tool is like,

01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:43.330
and what is involved in
getting ready for the pilot.

01:21:43.330 --> 01:21:48.370
Do I have any objections
from my colleagues

01:21:48.370 --> 01:21:51.940
on the front row [laughter],
alright.

01:21:51.940 --> 01:21:55.080
They set the stage for
this at ALA Annual,

01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:58.660
when I had been saying the first
quarter, then by the time I got

01:21:58.660 --> 01:22:03.000
up to make a presentation, I had to
say, well, I'm being pushed back,

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:07.090
and I think this really does make
sense in terms of the complexity

01:22:07.090 --> 01:22:09.770
of what we want to do, and
that this is really going

01:22:09.770 --> 01:22:13.880
to be a transformative
initiative, not just for our area,

01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:18.100
but for the Library of Congress
itself, and the community

01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:20.400
with which we are working.

01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:25.910
On that note, are there any final
questions or points to be raised?

01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:28.360
We have about three minutes.

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:31.430
If not, then we will close
with that, and I thank you

01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:33.800
for your participation
and my colleagues

01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:35.100
for the work they're
doing [applause begins]

01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:38.760
to make this happen
[applause continues].

01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:42.420
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
