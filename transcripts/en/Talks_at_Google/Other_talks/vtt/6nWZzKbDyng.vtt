00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:00.988
AXEL MARTENS: OK.

00:00:00.988 --> 00:00:01.750
Let's get going.

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:03.600
Thank you everybody
for coming here.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.120
Thank you very much for
giving me this opportunity

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.950
to talk about this.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.360
Yesterday, 25 years of the
fall of the Berlin Wall,

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.900
is definitely an event
that has changed the world,

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.970
and most certainly
has changed my life

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.680
and the life of my wife.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.130
We both lived in East Germany
at that point of time.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.790
And it's finally a world
changing event by the Germans

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:32.569
which is happy.

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:34.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.010
So this is a really great thing.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.490
And I want to talk
to you about this--

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.820
how it was to be there when the
Wall fell, how it was before,

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.070
and how it was after.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.880
So the Berlin Wall was, in
contrast to all the other walls

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.700
that you see in the world--
starting by the Chinese

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.810
Wall, Hadrian's Wall, or even
going to modern day history,

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.030
the border fortification
of different countries--

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.390
not designed to
keep enemies out,

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.960
but designed to keep
their own people in.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.240
And you have to imagine, it
went through the city of Berlin

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.370
on the length of 27 miles,
more than a marathon distance.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.150
And it stood for 28 years, more
than a life sentence in prison.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.370
And it was designed
to keep and kill

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.380
everybody who was trying to
overcome it from the East.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.530
Although the Eastern propaganda
said it was against fascism,

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.200
it was not.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.710
And we will see the
border fortification later

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.410
in greater detail that points
directly to the purpose.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.390
It was built as canyon
through a big city.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.300
It had 300 watchtowers.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.670
It was manned by
over 15,000 soldiers

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.930
at each moment in time.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.240
The overall border control
in Germany was 47,000 people.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.396
Most of the soldiers were
not in the border strip.

00:01:59.396 --> 00:02:00.520
They were in the back land.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.580
They were scouting
the area ahead.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.539
So they didn't want people
to get anywhere near that.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.220
5,000 people alone in Berlin
tried to overcome that.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.460
136 died-- confirmed.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.330
There is a number of deaths
that might have occurred

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.530
while trying to
swim through rivers,

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.240
but the bodies were
never recovered.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:31.824
The Wall fell on a Thursday
night at 25 past 11:00.

00:02:31.824 --> 00:02:33.240
Still have the
wrong number there.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.090
It was 25.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.350
I just checked it the other day.

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.480
As the result of a series
of completely unprecedented

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.670
events, and a big mistake.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.210
Or, a happy mistake,
let's put it that way.

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.200
And I want to share with
you how that came to being.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.200
And I definitely don't
want to bother you

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.230
with a boring history lesson.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.130
You can get all the facts.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.080
There's even very good
documentaries on YouTube

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.550
I can point you to.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.770
But I have to tell a little
bit about the background, why

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.000
the border was built, and
how did it came to being.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.970
And then I want to stress
the reality of the Wall,

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.054
and want to show you how it felt
to be on the side behind it.

00:03:19.054 --> 00:03:20.470
And then I want
to tell you how it

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.310
was to grow up in a
rural village, two

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.730
hours north of that,
being completely sheltered

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.230
and ignoring that
until you hit puberty

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.400
and finally realize
something is wrong.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.360
Something is rotten in
the state of Denmark.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.680
And how it has all got
a happy end in the end,

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.096
which could have gone
so easily the other way.

00:03:41.096 --> 00:03:42.970
It could have gone so
easily the Chinese way.

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:43.810
And it didn't.

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.140
And that's one of the best
things that ever happened.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.460
And yesterday I was talking
to a good friend of mine.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.620
He's a former British
Royal Air Force pilot.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.430
And he told me that the
fall of the Berlin Wall

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.220
was the biggest political
event in his life ever.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.970
And if it's so important
even for a Brit,

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.460
you can imagine how important
it is for the Germans,

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.540
and especially for East Germans.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.940
So thank you everybody
for coming here.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.680
Let's dive a little
bit into the history.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.250
Everything of course starts
with World War II and Germany

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.540
being divided by the
four occupying forces,

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.720
splitting Germany up as they
decided in Yalta up front.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.870
And Berlin, as a
microcosm of Germany,

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.220
was divided the same way.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.190
So you had four zones of
influence by the four forces.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.950
And pretty soon
the Western forces

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:43.020
agreed to work to govern and
form a common economic area,

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.900
at some point even to
form a common state.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.990
And the main reason
that the Wall was built

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.800
is that people left the
eastern parts in the millions.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.930
From the end of World
War II until the building

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.050
of the Berlin Wall, 3.5
million East Germans

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.380
left their country, starting
at a population of 18 million.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.800
So it's a 1/6 that
had left the country.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.850
It was mostly young.

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:11.850
It was mostly educated.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.200
It was mostly workforce.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.660
And why did they leave?

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.160
Well, first of all, there
was the standard of living.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.270
The Western zones had a way
better standard of living,

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.530
because first of all,
they had all the industry.

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.310
East Germany was very rural.

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.000
Secondly, they were profiting
from the Marshall Plan, where

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.650
the eastern part was still
bleeding out and paying

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.570
war reparations to Russia.

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.100
And thirdly, the
economics was built

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.690
on private entrepreneurship
in the west.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.970
Within the east, it
was all centralized

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.202
and not really motivational.

00:05:46.202 --> 00:05:47.410
But there were other reasons.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:52.680
There was the hindrance
or the hostility

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.930
against private business.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.020
There was the hostility
against private land owning.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.830
There was political oppression.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.180
There was hostilities
against religions.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.330
There were hostilities
against people

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.280
that had too big
a mouth, and lived

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.470
too close to strategic areas,
and they were relocated.

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:14.590
So they tried to stop the
exodus that would have certainly

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.800
been the death of the hopes for
the Communist society in East

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:18.360
Germany.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.480
So they built the Wall.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.720
And this building of
the Wall was directly

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.170
ordered from Moscow.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:28.570
So there was no doubt
in history that this

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:32.980
is-- the fear of East
Germany falling means

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:37.142
the entire Russian
empire falling in Europe.

00:06:37.142 --> 00:06:38.850
But that was the
history before the Wall.

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.360
The Wall was just the last piece
of closing the Iron Curtain.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.430
There was a lot before.

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.730
There was the Berlin blockage
and the famous airlift,

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:46.430
obviously.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.270
There was the founding of
the two German states--

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:53.860
Western Germany
found itself first,

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.990
trying to represent the
entirety of Germany.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.370
And then East Germans said no.

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:59.569
We are our own state.

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:01.110
And they formed a
little later-- they

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.820
formed on the 7th
of October, where

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.580
West Germany was found
in July, I guess.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.270
And then you had a long,
long land border of I

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:14.050
think over 1,100 miles
between both Germanys.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.560
And they were fortified
already in the '50s.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.600
And already in the '50s,
in the Operation Vermin,

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.230
everybody who was suspicious and
lived too close to the border,

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:25.770
were forcefully relocated.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:29.090
So the border strip, an
area of about 15 miles

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.510
of the actual
border, was cleansed

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:32.875
by everybody who was suspicious.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.540
Western Berlin
was already ringed

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.160
by a border fortification.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.810
The only open spot
was the city itself.

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:45.630
So people were going with
public transportation

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:48.800
into East Berlin, crossing
the border by foot,

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.620
and then being flown
out of West Berlin

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:57.820
to get to welcome camps
in the Western part,

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:02.390
until they got apartments
and jobs offered.

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:06.350
In the end, in one month
30,000 people alone

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:11.900
left East Germany
via East Berlin.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.900
So they decided to build a wall.

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:17.760
And this-- you see the
English in bold down there,

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.360
is one of the famous quotes.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:22.800
It's as famous as "there are
no Americans in Baghdad,"

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.040
or "I did not have
sex with that woman."

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.490
This is a quote everybody
in Germany knows, which

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:31.330
is two weeks-- no, actually
two months before the Wall was

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.960
built-- the head of state
and party in East Germany,

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:38.320
being asked whether they
have any plans, and he, as

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.130
innocent as a lamb
said, of course,

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:42.380
we don't have a plan
to build a wall.

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.300
We have so much
other things to do.

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.610
Yeah.

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:46.880
True.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.980
So German proficiency at
its best, and at it's worst,

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:52.160
obviously.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.890
In an operation on
a Sunday morning,

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:59.920
over 50,000 armed
forces were roused.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.830
And Russian tanks were
surrounding Western Berlin.

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:07.710
And at midnight, all the
forces were deployed.

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:09.080
At 1 a.m.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.820
Sunday morning, when
Berlin was sleeping,

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:17.340
the entire subway and transit
between the two cities

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:18.370
were cut.

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:19.890
The light was cut.

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:21.270
And then the Wall was built.

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:25.260
And five minutes, the
Brandenburg Gate was closed.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.900
The first Wall that
stood in Berlin

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.250
was a wall of armored
soldiers, that

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:32.880
didn't let anybody
going through.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:37.410
As the next step, 12 subway
lines were permanently severed.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.920
13 stations were bricked off.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:44.210
And in total, 193
streets were closed,

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:46.190
including bridges, rivers.

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:47.760
They closed sewers.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.690
They closed windows
in buildings.

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:51.700
We will see that in a moment.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:56.880
And when Berlin was waking
up, it was two cities.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.440
We see two pictures here.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.550
The upper is where
the French Quarter

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:07.100
was bordering the
Russian Quarter.

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:10.190
We see the subway is roped off.

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:14.300
And the other one is where
the hip area of Kreuzberg

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:19.050
is meeting [INAUDIBLE] Park on
the other side, where actually

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:22.040
the street belonged
to Eastern Germany.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.540
The walkway to Western Germany.

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.030
And people had to live
with that ugly thing

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:29.410
of a wall for over 28 years.

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:31.280
Why do I say mostly
a German problem?

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:36.540
The West Berliners hoped for
the intervention of the Allied

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:40.090
forces, of America, as of
the English or the French.

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:41.090
But they didn't.

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:44.150
They didn't for a good reason.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:46.660
At the end of the day--
and Kennedy's quote

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:52.580
brings it to a point-- a wall
is a lot damn better than a war.

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:54.940
And tearing down
that wall by force

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:58.650
with the American soldiers
would have brought a war.

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:01.900
And the soldiers weren't
even affected by it.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.670
The Allied forces,
both the Russians

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:07.950
as the Western Allied forces
had complete free of roaming.

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:09.760
Germany-- the Wall
didn't exist for them.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.330
They could go obviously
over border crossings.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.060
It wasn't that easy anymore.

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.185
But they could go around
where they wanted.

00:11:16.185 --> 00:11:18.310
There was the incident of
Checkpoint Charlie, where

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:22.050
the Russians were
pushing their luck

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:26.000
and trying to force border
controls of Western allies.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.160
And suddenly tanks
rolled on both sides,

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.520
and they stood there
for a week or two.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:35.640
And then both sides
decided that it's not

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.260
worth of killing each other
over a couple Germans.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:43.690
So the Wall stood, and
the Wall became reality.

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:47.900
One of the most spectacular
last places where the Wall stood

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:51.580
was Bernauer Strasse, where
actually the buildings were

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:55.140
the East, but the walkway
was already the West.

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:58.210
So people were jumping
out of their windows.

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:00.790
Armed forces were going
from house to house,

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:04.060
closing the windows, starting to
brick them off, guarding them.

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:07.140
And you see a
77-year-old lady trying

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:11.240
to jump out the
window into a sheet.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.080
The police ordered
the fire department

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.050
hold for her to land.

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:21.180
And down there is an East
German unofficial informant,

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:25.020
or civilian, trying
to pull her back in,

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.880
to prevent her from fleeing.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.840
And on the other side, you see
a 19 year-old soldier-- one

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.900
of the most famous pictures
of the Berlin Wall,

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:37.500
which was taken a week after
the initial cut-off when

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.830
the border just consisted
of a roll of barbed wire.

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:44.800
When he was walking exactly
that barbed wire, and then when

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.410
nobody was looking, jumped
over, threw his rifle back

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:50.320
to East Germany, and
ran into a waiting car

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:54.510
the Western police provided.

00:12:54.510 --> 00:13:00.340
So far about a year,
fleeing was still possible.

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:03.010
I mean, even with
German proficiency,

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:06.430
they couldn't close all
the loopholes in one.

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:08.780
But they tried very hard.

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:11.620
And one of the saddest
sections of that

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:14.120
is when they began to shoot.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.910
And they began to
shoot about two weeks

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:21.090
after the initial
dividing the city.

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:24.330
And there were a lot of
victims before Peter Fechter.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:30.560
But Peter Fechter is the
most horrid and the worst

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.520
demonstration of the
East German inhumanity.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.400
Because he was fleeing
with his friends,

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:40.230
and they already crossed
the strip that then became

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:41.840
named Death Strip.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.550
And they were
climbing the last wall

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:45.230
when the police opened fire.

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:46.080
Both were hit.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.820
His friend crossed the border.

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:52.430
He fell back into the
eastern-controlled section,

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:57.420
and laid there for an hour, and
screamed, and bled, and died.

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.470
And nobody did anything.

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:02.550
On the Western side,
there was reporters.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:04.360
There were hundreds of people.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:08.120
There was even US military
with direct orders

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:11.940
not to interfere, because it
was East German territory.

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.290
And on the east side, the
East German border control

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:19.650
did nothing, because they
were afraid of the Westerners

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:20.800
interfering.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.460
So they stood there
and waited for an hour

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:27.630
before they carried
his body away.

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:34.800
And this is the moment when
the hopes of a fast resolution

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:39.350
of that problem-- of an easy
way back to a unified Germany--

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:40.950
died, with Peter Fechter.

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:42.650
And the Wall grew.

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:47.380
The Wall became a reality.

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:52.020
For the Westerners, it became
a macabre tourist attraction,

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:55.210
with platforms where
they could look over.

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:58.970
And for the Eastern, it
became the end of the world.

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:03.360
A fortification even the
Romans would have dreamed on.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:07.520
And we will go into
how thoroughly they

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.070
built this fortification
in a moment.

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:21.320
What you have to imagine is
that it is a 3.5 million city.

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.850
It is after the war.

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:26.400
Apartments are scarce.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.740
Buildings are still destroyed.

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:32.490
People are living in
very cramped places.

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:36.720
And what East Germany did-- it
cleared a strip of-- between

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:40.910
on the narrowest point,
it's about 90 feet

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:42.270
on the widest point.

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:47.650
It was half a mile, where
they cleared everything.

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:48.810
Blew up churches.

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:49.880
Blew up houses.

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:52.460
Blew up whatever was standing
there to get them free

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:54.490
roam of shooting.

00:15:54.490 --> 00:16:03.350
The actual border was a line on
the Western side of the Wall.

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:06.740
And Westerners could actually
step over the border,

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:11.090
because there was about a
yard or two of land that

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:14.240
was belonging to East Germany.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.670
So whenever there were--
in especially in Kreuzberg,

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:21.680
in the later '60s, early '70s,
there were student riots.

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:25.250
And the Western police were
chasing the demonstrators,

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:26.860
they could actually
run on that strip.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.890
And the Western
police wasn't allowed

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:30.970
to cross that line on the floor.

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:31.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:34.290
And from the east,
obviously, nobody could come.

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:37.270
Because that Wall was
about 12 feet high.

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:40.310
And then you had the defense.

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:43.600
And I'm showing you a video
in a moment about that.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:48.760
But you see the signal fence,
the steeled-spike grid.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:53.130
And finally, the
vehicle trench--

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:57.560
all designed to prevent
fleeing from East to West.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.540
Doesn't make any sense if you
come the other way around.

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:03.090
And believe it or not, there
were successful escapes.

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:04.310
There were quite a few.

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:08.369
They were in the beginning, when
the Wall was just barbed wire,

00:17:08.369 --> 00:17:11.660
or a small wall-- people
just jumping over, climbing.

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.660
Later when it got a
little more elaborate,

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:15.240
it was the big time
of the tunnels.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:19.400
There were a total of, I
think, 57 tunnels [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:25.250
The biggest one got, I think,
75 people out into freedom.

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:26.980
Later they found other ways.

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:29.530
There was obviously
soldiers fleeing, such

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:30.930
that they changed the regime.

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:33.420
And you always went
with a different guy

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.560
each evening, on patrol.

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:39.040
You never could trust
the soldier next to you.

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.820
But that the most
famous story-- and I

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:43.069
don't have slides
to that, but I like

00:17:43.069 --> 00:17:44.860
to tell that story--
is the three brothers.

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:47.080
It's the tale of the
three brothers, who

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.510
escaped in three
different decades.

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:53.132
The first one had to serve
in the East German army--

00:17:53.132 --> 00:17:55.090
everybody had to serve
in the East German army.

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:56.900
But he was drafted
into border control,

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:59.330
not in Berlin but
in the countryside.

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:03.470
And he used that knowledge
to spy on the defenses.

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:07.330
And when he was relieved
from his army duty,

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:11.250
he went back there and swam
through the river into freedom.

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:13.300
And then he helped
his middle brother

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:18.770
to escape by shooting an arrow
over the Wall, tying a rope,

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:22.620
and then using it as a tight
rope-- not as a tightrope.

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:23.490
How do you call it?

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:24.240
AUDIENCE: Zipline.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.573
AXEL MARTENS: Zipline, actually.

00:18:25.573 --> 00:18:27.160
And he ziplined into freedom.

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:28.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:30.520
And then shortly before
the Wall came down,

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:34.990
the most daring escape
ever done-- those two guys

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:38.420
learned to fly
ultralight planes.

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.940
And they bought two ultralight
planes, shipped them on trucks

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:44.350
into Western Berlin,
via the transit route,

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:47.790
painted them in camouflage
and Russian emblems,

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:52.000
and then flew in the dawn over
the border, landed in a park

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.770
in Eastern Germany, picked up
their brother, and flew back.

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:55.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:58.010
And landed in
front of Reichstag.

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:02.420
And that was an escape
nobody believed.

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:06.470
But there were, as I told, a
lot of unlucky stories too.

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:11.280
When I was born, '72, and
as I said, the rural north,

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:17.070
about two hours
away from Berlin,

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:20.150
I didn't know anything of
that, even when I grew up.

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:23.690
I lived a real
nice-- you would here

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:27.410
small-town USA-- this was
small village, East Germany,

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:28.540
sheltered life.

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:30.540
We had about 30,000 people.

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:34.240
We had a couple ancient
landmarks, couple cathedrals,

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.940
and a castle.

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:39.240
We had a lot of woods
and lakes around.

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.450
It was really nice
to grow up there.

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:44.280
You could roam free
with your pals.

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:46.570
We had a lot of Russian
soldiers in the woods.

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:48.070
It was always fun to meet them.

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:49.870
And we brought them beer.

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:53.980
And we got their rank,
signatures, and stuff.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:55.230
And we traded.

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:57.140
And had a smoke, with clove.

00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:58.330
And so it was really fun.

00:19:58.330 --> 00:19:59.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:02.330
But of course we also had
our typical headquarters

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:04.000
of the party, and
the headquarters

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.620
of the secret police in town.

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:11.590
And everybody knew kind of, we
are away from the big scare.

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:13.460
But still we are watched.

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:14.230
Right?

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:23.860
And if you wanted to describe
the life in East Germany,

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:27.850
and it wouldn't have
been such a naughty book,

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:30.050
I would call that
"Fifty Shades of Grey."

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:32.810
Because East Germany
was all about grey.

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:34.190
There was no color.

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:36.530
First of all, we didn't
have any advertisements,

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:38.650
so there was no flashy displays.

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:41.340
But then also we didn't have
too much paint, it seemed.

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.990
So everything was grey.

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:47.080
On the other side, it
was extremely peaceful.

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.820
Well, that's the benefit of
living in a police state.

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:52.360
It's kind of safe.

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.912
There was barely any
mugging or stuff.

00:20:54.912 --> 00:20:57.120
And even if it happened, we
didn't have a free press.

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.286
So you didn't hear about it.

00:20:58.286 --> 00:20:59.530
So at least you felt safe.

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:00.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:02.000
It was well cared for.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.380
Everything was planned-- your
kindergarten, your pre-K,

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:05.910
your school, your whatever.

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:08.220
If you're good enough,
your university, your work,

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:09.630
your apartment.

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:11.450
They didn't plan
the spouses yet,

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:13.230
but I thought they
worked on that.

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:16.400
Maybe at some point they
would have gone that far.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:20.150
There was, in contrast to some
other East Bloc countries,

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:22.660
we never had a shortage on food.

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:25.320
So it was always enough.

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.880
It was well prepared.

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.680
Obviously it was
very well organized.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.550
Everybody had to be member.

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:33.150
For instance,
everybody who worked

00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:35.340
had to be a member in the union.

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:38.199
We weren't allowed to strike,
or to demonstrate, or anything.

00:21:38.199 --> 00:21:39.740
But we had to be a
member of a union.

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:41.100
I don't understand why.

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:42.670
Everybody went to
school obviously

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:44.540
had to be member of
the Communist youth

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:46.670
organization, which
gave me a scare.

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:48.585
When I first asked for
a visa here in the US,

00:21:48.585 --> 00:21:49.960
and they asked
you, have you ever

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:51.870
been member of a
Communist organization.

00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:55.290
And I had to say yes.

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:57.220
But I think that doesn't count.

00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:58.740
And it was very uniform.

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:03.670
What it did in the end is-- the
old cities were falling apart.

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:05.240
There was no money
for investments.

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:08.680
But to relieve the
shortening of apartments,

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:12.010
they built these beautiful
concrete blocks everywhere.

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:13.930
Very nice.

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:17.000
But you could live quite
nicely if you followed the six

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.990
basic rules of East
German happiness.

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:23.400
The first is, do the best
with whatever you can get.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.660
I mean, everything was scarce.

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:26.560
As I said, we had enough food.

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:30.580
But that means-- whatever,
bread, and butter, and salami.

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:32.890
It doesn't mean anything fancy.

00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:34.970
It doesn't mean
fruits all the year,

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:37.020
or vegetables all the year.

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:40.250
We had cucumbers, I
think, all the time.

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:43.620
And cabbage, obviously.

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:45.180
Everything else was rare.

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:46.190
So what do you do?

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:47.340
You see something.

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:48.020
There's a line.

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:48.740
You get in line.

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:51.280
Because if you don't need
it, you can trade it.

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:54.220
But most of the time
you need it yourself.

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:56.720
And you do a lot
of things yourself.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:57.760
There's crazy things.

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:00.517
People in Germany were
crazy about wallpaper.

00:23:00.517 --> 00:23:02.350
So they wanted to have
structured wallpaper.

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:04.290
But you couldn't get
structured wallpaper.

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:05.706
So that was an
inventor that said,

00:23:05.706 --> 00:23:07.650
well, you buy colored wallpaper.

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:09.030
And then you paint it white.

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:11.110
And then you use sawdust
and sprinkle it over it.

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:13.190
And then you have
structured wallpaper.

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:16.190
So instead of the companies
producing anything people need,

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:17.750
they produce stuff nobody needs.

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:19.840
But then we figured out
to make it into things

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:22.330
that actually people need.

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:25.880
Second thing is, money
was kind of worthless.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.950
First of all, everybody
had about the same.

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:32.040
Like a regular
worker in a factory

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.910
got about 800 German marks.

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:36.400
An engineer got maybe
1,000 German marks.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.620
A doctor maybe
1,150 or something.

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:39.940
It was all in the same range.

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:42.737
There was no big
difference in the money.

00:23:42.737 --> 00:23:44.320
And you couldn't buy
anything with it.

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.150
I mean, food was dirt cheap.

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:47.575
Even liquor was cheap.

00:23:47.575 --> 00:23:50.650
I mean everybody who
knows 1984 knows,

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:54.020
communism strives on strong
enemies and cheap liquor.

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:56.920
Those are the two
ingredients you need.

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:59.010
And everything else
wasn't to have.

00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:01.285
So what you do is,
you trade favors.

00:24:01.285 --> 00:24:03.090
So you say, OK, I fix your car.

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:06.080
You fix my roof, or whatever.

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:10.630
My mom in the later days
was a sales assistant

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:11.790
in an electric store.

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:16.420
She was selling meat slicers
and mixers and all that stuff.

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:19.450
And I never knew how many
of those things were scarce.

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:21.050
So what basically
those people did is,

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:22.800
they didn't sell it
to the general public.

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.340
They called up their
friends, and said, well,

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:27.740
we got a new shipment
of these devices.

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:28.640
Do you need anything?

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.560
And her friend in
the vegetable store

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:33.060
said, yeah, we got tomatoes.

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:35.080
I bring you some tomatoes,
and I get a mixer.

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:39.084
So it was all grey market
trade and stuff like that.

00:24:39.084 --> 00:24:40.250
And then, of course at work.

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:42.360
I mean, people were using
most of the facilities

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:44.130
at work to do their
own private stuff.

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:46.850
I mean, if you had access
to steel and welding,

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:49.670
you were building your
fences or your swing sets,

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:52.093
or whatever you were
building at work.

00:24:52.093 --> 00:24:52.820
Right?

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:54.840
You weren't paid for
performance anyhow.

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:55.600
So why perform?

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.680
Then one funny stuff
about East Germany

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:05.466
is, since we had no religious
freedom, freedom of speech,

00:25:05.466 --> 00:25:06.840
freedom of travel,
the only thing

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:08.650
is we had personal freedom.

00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:13.090
So people were way more
relaxed with their sexuality.

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:17.020
People were marrying often,
getting divorced often.

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:19.509
There was no-- I think
the concept of the lawyer

00:25:19.509 --> 00:25:20.050
didn't exist.

00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:20.720
I don't know.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:24.080
But it was not a money issue.

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.480
You were going swimming
nude at the beaches.

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:32.180
You were having a lot of
freedom in your, whatever,

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:37.260
450 miles north, south,
that East Germany was.

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:39.730
I lived actually very
close to the beaches.

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:41.540
And they are really,
really beautiful.

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:43.820
The only downside is the
water is really cold.

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:46.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:47.860
Then there are the don'ts.

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:49.360
So these were the three do's.

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:50.580
Now we have three don'ts.

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:54.190
The first thing you learn
from a very early age--

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:56.020
don't speak your mind.

00:25:56.020 --> 00:26:00.490
Especially, I grew up as
the fourth child of five.

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:04.590
My parents were not in
line of the politics.

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:07.120
So you learned
very early on that

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:10.010
there is something you
talk about at home, maybe.

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:11.700
But you never bring
it into school,

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:13.870
or you get into
deep, deep trouble.

00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:17.410
Then there was also--
in most of East Germany

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:19.390
you could receive western TV.

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:22.140
There was this one area,
a little mountainous

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.480
in the south-- we called
the Valley of the Clueless.

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:29.130
But everything else you
could receive western TV.

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:31.430
Because the western
transponder stations

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:34.362
were right at the border
to have maximum reach.

00:26:34.362 --> 00:26:36.320
And then right on the
other side of the border,

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:37.980
there were destroyers
of the signals,

00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:40.230
to impede maximum reach.

00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:42.030
And that was like an arms race.

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:44.115
But most of the time,
you get western TV.

00:26:44.115 --> 00:26:47.640
So you get all these
views from the other side.

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.257
But you talk about it in
school, you end up immediately

00:26:50.257 --> 00:26:51.340
in the principal's office.

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:54.680
And you get some
nasty talking to.

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:56.990
And then critical
discussions is very funny.

00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:59.380
Every now and then you
got a party official

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:00.770
who talked straight.

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:03.060
He really said, no,
not everything is good.

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:04.420
Not everything is nice.

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:06.780
Let's talk about the
problems you see.

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:09.040
And then later you figure
out, he worked for the MFS

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:12.290
and was reporting your answers
directly to the secret police.

00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:13.280
Nice.

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:16.920
And then end the end, don't
push the system too hard.

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.620
It is a dictatorship, after all.

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:22.340
It's a mostly
friendly-appearing dictatorship.

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:23.440
But it's a dictatorship.

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.500
I will recommend
a movie later that

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:27.400
is available in
English that really

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.910
shows what they could do.

00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:31.310
And they could do everything.

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:32.940
There was no Supreme Court.

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:34.340
There was no free press.

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:35.470
Who would you complain to?

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:36.460
Santa Claus?

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:38.470
There was no
instance above them.

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:40.790
They could deny you
to go to high school.

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:42.570
They could kick you
out of university.

00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:44.370
You end up shoveling
coal somewhere

00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:46.540
in an ancient factory.

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:49.010
They could, as I told
you, relocate you

00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:51.469
from where you live,
because either you

00:27:51.469 --> 00:27:53.510
live too close to the
border, or you make trouble

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:54.676
where you live, or whatever.

00:27:54.676 --> 00:27:56.470
Your apartment is
needed by somebody else.

00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:58.870
And apparently they
could put you to prison.

00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:01.340
What I did-- when I
was in high school,

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:04.610
we had to do mandatory military
service during summer breaks.

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:06.380
When you guys do
summer internship,

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:08.800
we had to play soldiers
and run through sand

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:13.620
and shoot and climb obstacles
and try invading West Germany.

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:14.660
Learn to.

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:16.150
And I told, I don't want to.

00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:19.540
I was slightly religious,
Protestant at that the time.

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:22.119
But I just didn't
want this shit.

00:28:22.119 --> 00:28:23.160
That was the main reason.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:26.380
I don't have much of a
strong feeling about arms,

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:28.140
but I didn't want to do that.

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:30.125
So I engaged in a
discussion, because it

00:28:30.125 --> 00:28:32.190
was a voluntary organization.

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:34.260
So they give you all
the spiel about you

00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:37.530
are pampered by the state,
they invest so much,

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:41.070
you have to pay back, it's not
about what you can-- whatever,

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:42.400
ask the state to do for you.

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.350
It's what you can
do for the state.

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:47.561
And then, in the end you say,
yeah, it's all nice, but no.

00:28:47.561 --> 00:28:48.310
Then they say, OK.

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:50.290
Let's speak frankly.

00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:52.915
You go in this organization
and to this summer camp,

00:28:52.915 --> 00:28:55.070
or you leave that school.

00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:57.906
And this is not me
being charged with going

00:28:57.906 --> 00:28:59.280
to prison or
something like that.

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:01.160
But it would have
ruined my whole career.

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:02.320
I couldn't have
gone to this school.

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:03.150
And there's no other school.

00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:05.800
I mean, either you go to high
school, or you're kicked out.

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:07.220
And then you end
up shoveling coal

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:09.630
somewhere in an old factory.

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:14.860
So of course I caved in and did
this shit and learned to shoot.

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:18.300
And then, well the most
important rule is never

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:19.730
try to escape.

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:22.640
And trying has
very funny things.

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:25.030
I mean, I wanted
to become a sailor.

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:26.900
I thought that was my career.

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:29.840
I wanted to be a captain at
sea or something like that.

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.890
Unfortunately I had a--
well, very fortunately,

00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:33.480
I had a grandma in the West.

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:34.570
So they told me no chance.

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:36.490
You're not getting on a boat.

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:38.100
You can steer that
boat to freedom.

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:38.370
No.

00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:38.640
No.

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:39.139
No way.

00:29:39.139 --> 00:29:40.340
You don't get that.

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:42.570
Become a cook or
something like that.

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:45.080
My brother wanted to
be in the flying club.

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:48.970
So they let him do-- all
winter, let him paint the shed

00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:51.540
and do all the theory
work and everything.

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:54.520
And when it came to
flying in the spring,

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:56.210
two guys-- and it
was so comical.

00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:57.400
They came to our
house in trench coats.

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:59.790
I mean, really, in trench
coats-- they came to our house

00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:01.690
and said, well, no.

00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:03.180
No flying for your son.

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:04.810
Sorry, grandma in the West.

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:06.230
Why not model trains?

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:08.930
It's a nice hobby as well.

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:11.630
So yes, it is funny.

00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:15.540
But there were ugly sides too.

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:17.110
There was no money.

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:20.270
Germany in the end of the '80s
was on the brink of collapse.

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:22.630
We got a couple big
loans from the West.

00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:24.450
We had no chance
to pay them back.

00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:28.430
We had no industry
production to speak of.

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:32.000
We sold everything we had,
every cultural object.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.990
There was a whole
department-- there was also

00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:39.290
the secret police handling that,
selling off cultural artifacts

00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:41.960
and art to get hard currency.

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:43.900
But in the end we
were really bankrupt.

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:46.400
So what happened is, there was
no investments in the cities.

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.170
The cities were falling apart.

00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:52.790
Leipzig, a city not really
badly hit in World War II,

00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:55.310
looked like they
were just attacked.

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:56.200
It looked horrible.

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.300
It was the worst city.

00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:00.400
Dresden, in contrast, because
it was so badly damaged

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.970
in the war, had all these
beautiful concrete blocks

00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:04.370
standing around.

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:06.510
But Leipzig was
an historic city--

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:08.080
was completely falling apart.

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:10.110
There was no sustaining
business model.

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:13.290
My other grandma owned a house.

00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:16.370
The rent for an apartment
was seven marks.

00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:18.760
How can you maintain
a house when

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:20.750
you have to rent it
out for seven marks?

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:24.380
And even if you had money,
you can't get material.

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:25.580
There is none to be had.

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:26.860
You can't hire labor.

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:28.120
There is none to be had.

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:29.970
And you don't get any support.

00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:32.450
In contrast, you get
grieved by the city

00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:34.757
because you're
sucking up resources

00:31:34.757 --> 00:31:35.965
that could be used otherwise.

00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:42.050
The industry was
running downhill.

00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:45.220
Germany was-- in
1985, by a UN study--

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:49.170
named the most dirty
country in Europe.

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:53.260
We had a lot of coal
mining, open coal mining.

00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:56.170
Whole neighborhoods
looked like the moon.

00:31:56.170 --> 00:32:00.470
We had the chemical industry
that was mainly based on coal.

00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:04.330
There was super high sulfate,
sulfur dioxide and ash

00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:06.430
concentrations in the air.

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:08.820
We had asthma,
cancer, everything.

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:13.110
We had-- in the
photo production,

00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:15.150
they had a lake they
called the Silver Lake.

00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:17.200
And that was not
because it was so nice.

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.880
It was because it was silver.

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:21.900
They were actually
piping all the dirt

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:26.010
from the photo production
into that lake.

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:30.040
Sad story, but kind
of ironic story.

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:35.020
The granddaughter of the
lead of state and party,

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:36.810
the granddaughter
of Erich Honecker,

00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:40.110
died of
pollution-induced asthma.

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:42.500
So not even those were safe.

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:45.120
It was really, really dirty.

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:47.320
And what did the
elite do about it?

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:48.870
Nothing.

00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:50.860
They were a country of old men.

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:54.300
In the end of the day, the
leadership-- the inner circle

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:58.880
of the party-- were 22 men with
an average rate of 68 years.

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:00.600
They didn't want to
hear what's going on.

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:02.290
They didn't even know
what was going on.

00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:05.660
They were living in a village
north of Berlin in the woods,

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:09.040
in their bungalows, completely
shielded from the world.

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:12.180
And what gave the people
in East Germany [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:16.060
is, when Soviet Union
started to open up

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:20.040
and Gorbachev started
to engage in discussion

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:23.310
and open for
change, East Germany

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:24.890
said no, we don't
need to do that.

00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:27.420
For decades and
decades they told us,

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:31.040
the Soviet Union is the
leading example to victory.

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:33.910
And suddenly they did, for the
first thing, something good.

00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:35.409
And then they said,
oh we don't have

00:33:35.409 --> 00:33:37.260
to follow every whim they have.

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:39.690
So it was really, really
crazy at that time.

00:33:39.690 --> 00:33:43.140
The time was ripe
for revolution.

00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:48.320
Unfortunately, what happened
just before the Wall came down,

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:53.670
in summer of 1989, was
the massacre of Tiananmen.

00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:57.770
So it could have easily
gone the other way.

00:33:57.770 --> 00:34:01.580
The good fortune that
we had that it didn't go

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:03.860
is that Gorbachev
actually started

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:06.160
cutting down the Iron Curtain.

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:11.210
It was his
reform-oriented politics

00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:16.010
that made it clear that the
Soviet Union is not willing any

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:20.770
more to intervene if
countries in their empire

00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:23.100
decide to go a separate way.

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:26.389
It was made clear that there
will be no Prague Spring

00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:30.340
or cutting down the
Hungarian revolution,

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:34.120
or even the German
uprising in '53, anymore.

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:38.020
Every country has the right
to design their own future.

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:42.300
And triggered by that, Hungary
started in June of 1989

00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:47.760
to cut down the Iron
Curtain to Austria.

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.980
Which didn't mean that
immediately the border was

00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:53.600
open, but at least
they said, well, this

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:57.080
is a border now that isn't
shoot-to-kill anymore.

00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:59.080
This is a border like
between every country.

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:00.060
And you can cross it.

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:04.770
But you can't just run over
and smuggle or stuff like that.

00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:06.980
Well what happened
is, Hungary was

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:09.830
one of the few countries
East Germans could travel.

00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:11.150
They had to ask for permission.

00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:12.830
It wasn't called a
visa, because visa

00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:14.550
sounds like we are not brothers.

00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:16.380
But it was a visa in fact.

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:17.960
And it could be denied.

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:20.470
But it was often granted.

00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:25.300
So in summer of 1989,
hundreds and then thousands

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:27.680
went to Hungary and
crossed that border.

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:29.000
Then they closed Hungary.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.240
And suddenly said, no, you
can't travel to Hungary anymore.

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:35.850
Well, what people did then,
they went into the embassies.

00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:38.180
West Germany didn't have
an embassy in East Germany,

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:39.980
because West Germany
didn't recognize

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:41.620
East Germany as a state.

00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:44.420
So they went into the
embassies in Warsaw,

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:46.350
in the West German
embassies in Warsaw,

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:50.100
and the West German
embassies in Prague.

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:53.890
And one of the moments
that still gives me

00:35:53.890 --> 00:35:58.400
goosebumps is when they finally
negotiated that-- I think

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:03.380
at that point 7,000--
yeah, 5,000 is here.

00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:06.400
People that were camping out
in the West German embassy--

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:09.200
the embassy wasn't built
to hold 5,000 people--

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:14.710
were allowed to leave
Prague towards the West.

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:18.020
And Genscher, the foreign
minister of West Germany,

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:21.070
gave that famous
speech on the balcony.

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:26.500
That was the last nail in
the coffin of East Germany,

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:28.254
kind of.

00:36:28.254 --> 00:36:30.420
So what happened then is
people went to the streets.

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:31.860
They say, OK.

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:33.530
Everybody who wants
to leave the country

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:34.985
suddenly can leave the country.

00:36:34.985 --> 00:36:37.110
Well, what about the people
that want to stay here?

00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:38.068
We don't want to leave.

00:36:38.068 --> 00:36:39.700
We want to change.

00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:41.500
So they started
going on the streets.

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:45.290
And they started in Leipzig.

00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:49.290
Every Monday they had
Protestant service.

00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:52.510
And then they went out with
candles and walked the streets.

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:54.990
And the first
Monday was, I think,

00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:57.180
September 3 or
something like that.

00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:58.440
There was 500.

00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:00.330
The next Monday it was 5,000.

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:02.860
The next Monday it was 20,000.

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:07.560
That was the Monday before the
40th anniversary of the East

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:09.190
German Republic.

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:15.070
So the police went in and
arrested quite a few of them

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:18.340
and showed brute force.

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:19.890
But it didn't stop them.

00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:24.300
The next Monday, 70,000
were on the street.

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:26.120
East Germany had pulled
together everything

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:30.960
they had in terms of
mobile police, tanks.

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:35.130
The hospitals were
stacked up blood reserves.

00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:39.990
Schools and camps were
cleared for internment camps.

00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:43.810
Everything was done for
the Chinese solution.

00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:46.920
And then, thanks to
the commander-in-chief

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:51.100
of the Leipzig police
force, he ordered retreat.

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:54.930
He ordered his men to
guard the armored vehicles,

00:37:54.930 --> 00:37:56.180
but not to interceded.

00:37:56.180 --> 00:38:00.190
And 70,000 were allowed to
walk through the entire street,

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:04.900
putting candles in front of
the secret police headquarter,

00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:09.260
in front of the
party headquarter.

00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:13.950
And then a week later,
Berlin had 500,000

00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:17.680
to a million-- the numbers
are not finally determined.

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:20.970
But 500,000 to a million
went on the street

00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:26.620
to demonstrate for free
elections, free travel,

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:31.610
and generally a bend in the
mandate of the Communist Party

00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:35.360
and the tyranny of
the secret police.

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:42.940
So the leadership had already
dethroned Erich Honecker.

00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:46.300
And they wanted to save
whatever there was to save.

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:48.750
So they decided,
well everybody's

00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:50.330
fleeing the country.

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:54.330
Let's make it appear like
we are still in charge.

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:57.440
Let's make a law
that allows people

00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:59.480
to leave the country lawfully.

00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:02.210
Then at least we look
like we are in charge.

00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:06.330
So they asked a poor guy
in the administration

00:39:06.330 --> 00:39:08.750
of visas and
passports or whatever

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:11.580
to come up with a
draft for a law that

00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:15.140
allows the permanent
relocation of East Germans,

00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:17.150
in legal terms.

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:19.050
And this guy and
his two assistants,

00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:22.150
for the first time in
their life, thought.

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:25.310
So they thought, people
don't want to leave.

00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:27.310
They want to travel.

00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:29.190
Most of them want to travel.

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:30.950
They want to have
freedom of travel,

00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:33.550
not leaving their homes.

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:38.250
So they worked beyond their
mandate on a draft that says,

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:41.860
this is a draft for a law that
allows each German citizen

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:46.215
to travel, without any
prerequisites, freely.

00:39:46.215 --> 00:39:48.590
Only thing you have to do is
they have to get a passport.

00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:50.300
And then they can travel.

00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:52.350
So he drafted that.

00:39:52.350 --> 00:39:55.530
And this is the draft here, for
everybody who can speak German.

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:59.430
It reads, "Private
travels abroad

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:06.190
can be asked for, without any
preconditions like relations

00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:08.790
or special occasions.

00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:16.620
The papers should be handed
out on very short notice.

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:20.530
And only in very restricted
cases should be denied."

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:24.340
So they wrote this draft and
handed it to the channels

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:26.400
to be rejected.

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.440
They assumed it
will be rejected.

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:30.265
But nobody read it, actually.

00:40:30.265 --> 00:40:31.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:34.350
They handed it through to
this poor guy, or whatever.

00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:38.160
He was a member of
the inner circle,

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:40.260
responsive for
press communication.

00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:45.690
He was kind of the
king's press reference.

00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:48.604
And what he did is,
he got this paper,

00:40:48.604 --> 00:40:50.520
and he read it out loud
in a press conference.

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:52.170
And so, I got this
draft here, and it

00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:57.030
says we have a new law that
says that private travel abroad

00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:59.860
can be asked for without
any prerequisites.

00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:01.535
And then somebody asked, when?

00:41:01.535 --> 00:41:02.035
When?

00:41:02.035 --> 00:41:03.420
And he said, I don't know.

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:06.590
As far as I know,
effective immediately.

00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:12.320
And that was 6:53 p.m.

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:15.330
in East Berlin.

00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:16.920
And I was-- where's my?

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:18.320
Oh, it's there.

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:21.680
And I was, as usual, watching
the 8:00 o'clock West German

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:22.540
main news.

00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:28.450
So it's an hour later, about,
watching the main newscast.

00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:30.330
And they told, the Wall is open.

00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:32.470
And this is like--
imagine you're

00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:36.834
watching your favorite whatever,
football game, or "New Jersey

00:41:36.834 --> 00:41:38.500
Housewives" or whatever
you're watching,

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:41.160
and suddenly there's
breaking news,

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:44.000
"Aliens landed on the
White House lawn."

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.390
That is about the
magnitude of this newscast.

00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:51.530
So what happened is
West Germany already

00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:53.530
declared victory--
the borders are open.

00:41:53.530 --> 00:41:55.430
But they weren't.

00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:58.780
So it was announced that they
will be, but they weren't.

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:02.130
So the Berliners-- not
shy in any circumstances--

00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:04.076
went to the border like crazy.

00:42:04.076 --> 00:42:04.950
And they stood there.

00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:07.100
And they were yelling
for crossing over.

00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:10.330
And first there were 100,
and then there were 1,000.

00:42:10.330 --> 00:42:15.570
And [INAUDIBLE]
Bernauer Strasse,

00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:17.580
one of the biggest
border crossings,

00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:23.230
there were about 20,000 people
demanding to cross the border.

00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:27.720
The border control at the
point was manned by 16 people.

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:32.210
They had about 25 AK47
rifles and a couple

00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:34.800
small, whatever, grenades.

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:39.740
But nothing serious in getting
those numbers under control.

00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:41.780
So what they did in
the first attempt is

00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:45.990
they grabbed those people who
were shouting the loudest,

00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:49.200
grabbed them, stamped
their documents "invalid"

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:52.090
and shoved them over
to West Germany.

00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:54.940
The people didn't know that
it was stamped "invalid,"

00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:56.710
they just know, oh, I can go.

00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:58.390
But they had orders
to everybody who

00:42:58.390 --> 00:43:01.170
has that stamp to never
let them in again.

00:43:01.170 --> 00:43:06.140
So they got about 500
people out of this group--

00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:08.110
they grabbed and pushed
over to the West.

00:43:08.110 --> 00:43:10.700
And then they thought they
have handled this problem.

00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:11.440
But they hadn't.

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:13.590
Because on the western
side, the West German TV

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:16.220
was filming, and said, well
the border is really open.

00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:17.490
Now people are coming.

00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:20.140
Now all the border
crossings in East Berlin

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:24.290
were flocked by-- I mean,
East Berlin had about 1.2

00:43:24.290 --> 00:43:25.821
million people at this time.

00:43:25.821 --> 00:43:27.320
I don't know how
many stayed in bed.

00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:29.680
I don't think many.

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:34.590
So what those guys did in the
end is they declared defeat.

00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:36.350
They said we can't do anything.

00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:38.510
They had their 16
guys they still had,

00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:42.020
and there's a very nice
German documentary I just saw.

00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:44.940
I don't know whether there's
a translation available yet.

00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:49.190
They had those 16 guys
arming their barracks,

00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:52.240
their armory, their
document station.

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:53.760
And the rest completely open.

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:55.759
They opened all the
gates, stepped back,

00:43:55.759 --> 00:43:56.550
and started crying.

00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:58.300
There's pictures--
it's so funny-- there's

00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:01.230
pictures of these-- most
of the border control

00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:05.100
were actually Stazi, were
actually secret police.

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:07.250
And most of them
had built the wall

00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:09.240
and believed in that system.

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:12.630
So you see all those people
yelling and being happy

00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:15.180
and crossing the border, and
even hugging and kissing them

00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:16.290
and drinking champagne.

00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:17.790
And then you see
this border soldier

00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:20.670
standing there and
actually crying.

00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:22.860
And it was not tears
of happiness for them.

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:23.850
But who cares?

00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:25.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:25.110 --> 00:44:29.990
The fun part is this bridge
was called Bosebrucke,

00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:32.450
which means Evil Bridge.

00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:35.290
It is not really!

00:44:35.290 --> 00:44:37.590
So the big party started.

00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:40.620
Although the Brandenburg Gate
wasn't a border crossing,

00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:44.980
people were gathering,
were jumping on the Wall.

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:47.650
All the police had gone away,
had hid in their barracks,

00:44:47.650 --> 00:44:48.890
and cried.

00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:52.470
Or got rid of their
uniform and crossed.

00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:55.940
You see that East German car,
the Trabi, that went over,

00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:58.290
and that was the symbol
of the reunification.

00:44:58.290 --> 00:45:00.240
And people in West
Berlin came out

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:02.800
and handed out bananas and beer.

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:04.030
And there was a big party.

00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:07.670
Until, I think, 6:00 in the
morning, the entire city was--

00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:09.380
I unfortunately wasn't there.

00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:14.150
I was, as I said, 200
kilometers-- 120 miles away.

00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:16.000
So what I did in the
next day, instead

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.840
of going to Berlin which I
thought, it's way too crowded,

00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:22.940
I jumped on the train
and went to Hamburg.

00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:26.280
Because I had friends,
the summer before I met,

00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:27.890
they lived in Hamburg.

00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:29.700
So I thought I go there.

00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:33.012
It was the same fun.

00:45:33.012 --> 00:45:34.220
So what happened to the Wall?

00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:36.220
There was people
hacking it down.

00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:37.930
So you see these
two elderly ladies.

00:45:37.930 --> 00:45:38.740
It's so funny.

00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:39.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:41.150
Coming with a
chisel and a hammer.

00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:44.680
I actually had a piece
of Wall-- illegitimate.

00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:46.880
I hacked it myself,
but I lost it

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:48.900
when I moved to
the US [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:50.230
Now you can buy it everywhere.

00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:53.680
Apparent to what is sold
in terms of mementos,

00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:55.930
the Wall must have been
200 miles, because--

00:45:55.930 --> 00:45:58.369
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:58.369 --> 00:45:59.660
But you just see it everywhere.

00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:01.880
I mean, there's pieces
of Wall in Berlin.

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:04.680
There's a very nice
new museum in D.C.,

00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:07.830
to News Museum, that has
actually a watchtower

00:46:07.830 --> 00:46:09.780
and a piece of Wall
and everything.

00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:12.780
It's a very nice museum.

00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:15.200
So what happened after
that is, if you have to be,

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:18.420
whatever-- there were
many East Germans going

00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:21.360
to work in Russia
or Cuba, whatever.

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:24.220
They were on a year's
or two years' term.

00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:26.220
So they were away.

00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:29.400
The road from the first big
demonstration and the opening

00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:32.690
of the Wall to the
reunification was 11 months.

00:46:32.690 --> 00:46:35.510
Within those 11
months, happened--

00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:37.650
the complete meltdown
of the government.

00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:39.790
Everybody retired.

00:46:39.790 --> 00:46:41.810
And government of a round table.

00:46:41.810 --> 00:46:44.410
The first free election,
the negotiation

00:46:44.410 --> 00:46:49.060
with the Allied forces.

00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:52.460
The negotiation with
our European neighbors.

00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:55.000
Finally, the green
light by Gorbachev

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.400
to allow a unified
Germany to stay

00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:59.820
in NATO, which was the
condition for the British

00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:02.340
to accept the reunification.

00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:05.920
The complete regain of
sovereignty of Germany,

00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:08.000
and then finally to
the reunification.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.420
In the middle, there
was the monetary union.

00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:11.650
Suddenly we got real money.

00:47:11.650 --> 00:47:13.200
That was really,
really exciting.

00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:16.290
So everything was in 11 months.

00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:18.290
And that was quite a joyride.

00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:19.680
That was really fun.

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:22.960
And why did it all happen?

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:24.070
Of course, because of him.

00:47:24.070 --> 00:47:30.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:30.550 --> 00:47:32.240
So what's left of the Wall?

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:35.450
Right now, we have
across Berlin,

00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:37.860
in the center of
Berlin, this double row

00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:42.540
of bricks, with a brass
plate every couple yards,

00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:45.250
marking where the
actual Wall was.

00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:47.460
Because otherwise,
you can't tell.

00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:50.260
You have to imagine, this
was prime real estate.

00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:52.320
This was really
the best of Berlin.

00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:57.380
There is now huge corporations,
nice movie theaters,

00:47:57.380 --> 00:47:59.420
and everything is built there.

00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:03.220
Actually the US embassy is built
on the former border strip.

00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:07.440
The Hotel Adlon,
everything is built there.

00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:09.830
You have at Bernauer
Strasse where

00:48:09.830 --> 00:48:12.630
the buildings, and finally
the church was torn down.

00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:16.390
And you now have
600 yards free area.

00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:18.649
They re-created a
little bit of Wall.

00:48:18.649 --> 00:48:19.690
So that's typical German.

00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:21.559
First they have to
tear everything down.

00:48:21.559 --> 00:48:22.600
And they say, oh damn it.

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:23.641
Now we have no Wall left.

00:48:23.641 --> 00:48:24.860
So now they recreated it--

00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:26.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:26.190 --> 00:48:28.510
--for a museum.

00:48:28.510 --> 00:48:30.380
And then what you have
still-- and that's

00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:33.040
where I lived in Berlin,
near the Eastside Gallery.

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:37.460
It's about 1.2 miles of border.

00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:39.290
And that was the
East German side.

00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:44.200
So it was never painted when
there Wall still was a wall.

00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:46.050
But after the Wall
came down, you

00:48:46.050 --> 00:48:50.600
had a lot of very renowned
artists come and paint that.

00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:53.570
And that's, I think,
now a UNESCO World

00:48:53.570 --> 00:48:56.370
Heritage or something like that.

00:48:56.370 --> 00:48:59.900
Yeah, we saw him already.

00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:00.420
Crazy.

00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:02.226
It's the Germans [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:02.226 --> 00:49:03.100
It's not just a hoax.

00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:04.370
My sister went to concerts.

00:49:04.370 --> 00:49:07.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:09.820
Two movies I want to recommend.

00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:11.920
"The Lives of Others"
is the scary one.

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:15.720
That's really the one where
you see what the Stazi can do,

00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:20.190
what they have access to, what
they can do with your life

00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:23.050
if you don't play nicely.

00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:25.320
The funny one is
"Good Bye Lenin,"

00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:30.800
which is about a
communist-believing mother who

00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:33.470
has an accident and
falls into a coma.

00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:37.330
And then her country disappears
while she is in a coma.

00:49:37.330 --> 00:49:40.270
And then she wakes
up again, and her son

00:49:40.270 --> 00:49:42.900
has to fake that
the country is still

00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:47.510
existing to soften the
shock of what had happened.

00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:50.460
So he had to recreate all
these East German products that

00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:53.220
had disappeared overnight.

00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:55.900
So it's a really funny movie.

00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:59.360
And when you are in space,
if you ever get the chance,

00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:00.970
look down at Berlin at night.

00:50:00.970 --> 00:50:04.900
You still see where the Wall
was, which is very funny.

00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:07.247
You don't see here, because
the light is too bright.

00:50:07.247 --> 00:50:09.330
But the East German is
yellow, and the West German

00:50:09.330 --> 00:50:12.620
is white, because they used
different streetlights,

00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:14.130
different bulbs.

00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:17.130
So the color of
everything is yellow,

00:50:17.130 --> 00:50:18.240
and everything is white.

00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:24.530
So you can see exactly,
if you look at the slides

00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:25.720
where the border was.

00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:30.650
The slide deck is available
at GoBerlin-wall-2014.

00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:32.800
And I am so proud of
my company because they

00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:34.790
had yesterday such a
nice Google doodle.

00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:37.560
I don't know if
anybody saw that.

00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:38.320
And that's it.

00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:40.450
I thank you very much
for your attention.

00:50:40.450 --> 00:50:42.837
Maybe we have a
minute for questions.

00:50:42.837 --> 00:50:45.690
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:45.690 --> 00:50:46.190
Yeah.

00:50:49.070 --> 00:50:53.030
AUDIENCE: So, how was the
life like the next 10 years

00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:57.790
for the average East German
and how did that work?

00:50:57.790 --> 00:51:02.420
AXEL MARTENS: So there's
funny sides to that.

00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:04.750
Financially everything
went better.

00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:09.260
But there were a lot of people
that lost their positions,

00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:13.510
due to the industry being
run down and closed down.

00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:16.250
And then also
university teachers

00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:18.200
were relieved, because
in the old system

00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:19.825
they had to collaborate
with the party,

00:51:19.825 --> 00:51:21.890
or they had to be party members.

00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:27.260
So there was a generation
of, I would say, 45, 50 plus,

00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:32.280
at that point in time
who suffered for a while.

00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:34.150
Not, as I said, not financially.

00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:35.450
There was no real hardship.

00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:39.740
We had a very well-roped
networked that caught you.

00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:43.520
But for a time, there
was a little bit regret.

00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:47.027
Not in general of the way,
but maybe everybody else.

00:51:47.027 --> 00:51:48.360
Couldn't we have done it slower?

00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:50.850
Couldn't we have saved
a little bit here?

00:51:50.850 --> 00:51:53.116
Everybody in my
generation was so happy.

00:51:53.116 --> 00:51:54.740
I mean, it was
absolutely unbelievable.

00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:57.150
And there were so many
new opportunities.

00:51:57.150 --> 00:51:58.710
I mean, you could
open your own pub,

00:51:58.710 --> 00:52:02.210
or you could finally
do your own business.

00:52:02.210 --> 00:52:04.250
And Berlin, for
the next 10 years,

00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:06.370
was the most fun
place in the world.

00:52:06.370 --> 00:52:11.690
I mean, you had that morbid
charm of a rundown city,

00:52:11.690 --> 00:52:16.090
and nobody really
prohibiting anything anymore.

00:52:16.090 --> 00:52:20.530
There was basically art
installations, or happenings.

00:52:20.530 --> 00:52:22.530
Everything was allowed.

00:52:22.530 --> 00:52:24.660
There was no zoning
laws at that time.

00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:26.880
So you could basically
do what you want.

00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:28.110
And you felt the vibe.

00:52:28.110 --> 00:52:29.370
And you felt the change.

00:52:29.370 --> 00:52:32.610
And was-- I moved.

00:52:32.610 --> 00:52:36.000
I had to do my-- that was also
a side effect of the Wall.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:37.660
I was dreading my
military service.

00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:40.150
Everybody had to do
military service.

00:52:40.150 --> 00:52:42.030
And after the Wall
came down, they

00:52:42.030 --> 00:52:46.340
allowed to do
alternative service.

00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:48.670
So instead of learning
to shoot people,

00:52:48.670 --> 00:52:52.190
I learned how to change
diapers in a in a daycare.

00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:53.130
Well, it was more fun.

00:52:53.130 --> 00:52:54.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:54.650 --> 00:52:56.910
When I did this, when
I was done in '91,

00:52:56.910 --> 00:52:58.150
I actually moved to Berlin.

00:52:58.150 --> 00:53:01.620
And then I lived and studied
and worked for my first years

00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:03.050
in Berlin.

00:53:03.050 --> 00:53:05.440
And yeah, it's an amazing place.

00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:06.740
It's really, really fun.

00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:13.870
Well, thank you.

00:53:13.870 --> 00:53:17.220
[APPLAUSE]
