00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:00.900
Hey guys!

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.620
What would happen if you took transparent green slime

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.940
and dunked it into a container of liquid nitrogen?

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.260
You've been asking for it,

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:08.720
So today, I'm doing it,

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.700
We have a container of liquid nitrogen

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.640
Now we need some ninja turtle ooze

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.460
And you might remember a previous

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.660
video I showed you how to make it

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.140
All you need is some transparent school glue,

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.500
some yellow and green food coloring

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.320
and some borax.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.180
Now to make our ninja turtle slime,

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.040
all you need to do is pour

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.620
a little bit of water into one bowl.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.980
Doesn't have to be much, maybe just

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.140
half a cup or so.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.420
And then pour a little bit more

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.800
water into a different container.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:30.780
Same amount -

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.220
quarter to half a cup.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.040
It doesn't really matter

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.300
Now we're going to take our

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.020
school glue

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.640
and we're going to empty the entire container

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.280
into the one with about half a cup of water

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.280
Then we're going to take some of our green food coloring

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.620
and add five drops of green,

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.420
two drops of yellow

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.900
and then go ahead and stir it all up

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.000
You want to keep stirring it until

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.300
it feels like the glue has blended in thoroughly with the water.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.940
Kind of looks like green jello.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.180
But you don't want to drink this stuff.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.080
Now to our other container we're going to add

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.920
a little bit of borax

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.460
We're aiming

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.640
for about half to one tablespoon

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.860
but it doesn't have to be perfect.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.000
If you end up using too much borax,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.500
it won't dissolve

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.600
but it's not a big deal.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.160
Just add a little more water until it does.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.700
At this point, we add the two liquids together

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.180
and watch the magic happen.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:09.620
Here we go

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.560
Just like that guys,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.680
you can see instantly it starts globbing up

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:18.720
Look at that!

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.700
Just takes no time at all

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.200
we've got instant slime

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.620
This is why you don't have to worry about using too much water,

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.820
'cause all the slime just globs to itself

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.580
and you can pull it out and leave all the reside behind

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.240
It is amazing

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.560
how quickly that comes together.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.600
Alright, at this point we can just

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.580
reach in and grab it!

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.660
Oh yeah, that's some good stuff. Look at that.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.800
Oh man, that's perfect.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.860
Transparent, green, gooey

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.040
ninja turtle ooze

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.520
Fishing for slime...

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.740
You can just let your slime sit in a cup for a couple minutes.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.220
All the water will collect out

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.820
and you can just pour it off, and then you're just left with the gooey slime itself.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.700
If you scoop this stuff in your hands,

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.440
you can see it comes out in, like, a nice, green glob

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.580
and it moves very very slowly

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.000
but over time it will, like, start to drip.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.460
It's very cool stuff.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
And it's non-toxic, so if you get any in your mouth

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.380
it's not really gonna do much harm

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.140
It just doesn't taste very good.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.060
You can break it,

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.820
but then just give it a few seconds

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.040
and it just melds right back into itself again.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.820
It's now time to take our liquid nitrogen,

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:36.840
put it in this container,

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.220
and then dunk the slime in it.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.740
Aw, that's so cool!

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.340
It looks like, kinda foggy and cloudy,

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.320
and then when I blow it,

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.980
it just brightens right up.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.940
And that green slime on those

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.380
black gloves looks amazing.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.320
This slime has just been sitting here and

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.580
already you can see it's starting to get a little

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.980
bit crispy around the edges.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.080
I say crispy, but it's actually

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.260
just freezing.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.260
Alright, let's make it happen

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.500
Slime vs. liquid nitrogen.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.300
Oh wow, it went through like a top layer of nitrogen there

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.160
I'm just gonna hold it here, and let it dip itself into the nitrogen

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.960
Oh, wow

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.300
That's cool.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.200
*chill, science-y music*

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.180
Whoops, dropped it.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.740
Well there's no going back now, is there?

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.560
So is this getting hard yet?

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.920
Yep, that's starting to freeze up.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:32.940
That's really cool though, this part

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.340
right here is really spongey,

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.360
and still very slimy,

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.300
but yet right here is, like, frozen solid.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.320
Wonder if I could actually pull that out now

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.560
Whoop, that's cold.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.980
Oh, wow.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:47.720
Look at that.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.760
Look at that! *laughs*

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.240
This is the part that went into the nitrogen first

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.600
and you can see that actually is frozen solid now.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.100
You know what this reminds me of,

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.820
is those little gummy frogs that you get

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.340
that are like white on the bottom and

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.580
gummy and green on the top?

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:02.300
So let's put this in,

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.680
and get the rest of it.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.460
*chill music*

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.280
Man, look at all the vapor

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.080
It's still springy

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.020
it's still spongy here

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.020
which actually is really surprising.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.220
When I pull this out, listen to it crackle.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.080
*crackles*

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.740
Oof, it's a little cold to hang onto

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.780
and these breaking off in my hand here.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:36.500
Look at this.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:40.420
That's solid.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.960
Look at that!

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.520
That's one of the first pieces that went-

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:46.500
whoops

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.260
That's like as hard as a rock.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.140
It's kind of even got the slime texture to it.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.280
That looks pretty neat.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.660
Yeah, shatters, yeah...

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.220
Oh wait, wait! Look!

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.720
Inside here there's still a little

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.760
bit of slime that is not frozen.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.340
That is weird!

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.120
Let's crack this stuff open and see

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:08.940
what's inside.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.640
Let's give this a little tap.

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.060
Oh, that's harder than I thought.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.980
Holy heck!

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.280
Alright.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:19.300
Daaaang.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.380
And look at that! Inside of there

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.920
it's still slime!

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.120
You can still dig it out.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.120
So this is really interesting, guys.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.640
We froze the slime in liquid nitrogen

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.880
for about a minute,

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.320
and I thought this thing was frozen completely solid,

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.080
and yet when we smash it open,

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.620
we have these slimy green bits that don't seem to be affected at all

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:38.960
This is very very peculiar.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:39.980
It almost makes me feel like

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.760
the outside layer that's freezing

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.380
is forming an insulating barrier

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.000
preventing the cold to travel through to the middle.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.920
I'm under the impression this might take a while to warm these things back up,

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.720
so I went and got my propane torch.

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:13.460
*whispers* Smoky!

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:14.680
That is nuts.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.140
I can smell, like, burning slime.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.940
What does that feel like?

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:19.980
It feels like taffy.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.140
Alright, update guys.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:23.620
This stuff is taking forever to thaw.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.120
We've tried heating it with a blowtorch,

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.680
we've let it sit for half an hour

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.580
and it's starting to warm up

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.680
it's getting to kind of like this gummy stage,

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.280
but it's not thawing out.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:33.720
So to speed the process, I tried

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.360
filling up a container with very very hot water.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.600
Let's see if that makes a difference.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.920
Oh wow, it floats.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:40.520
Wasn't expecting that.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.160
So that's super interesting, guys

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.360
If, uh, you put frozen slime

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.780
into warm water it will actually float

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.140
until the ice melts, and then it'll sink.

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.900
Ooh, it's nice and gooey.

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:53.260
That's fun.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.540
So my nitrogen evaporated out of this

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.020
container but I still have this one left,

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.800
I was thinking if we dangle a piece of string down to the nitrogen,

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.940
Oh, wow, look at that!

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.480
You can like actually see the second it hits the vapor

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.320
Oh, man, that is really cool.

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.980
Slime is awesome!

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:20.740
Play with it!

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:21.480
Do it!

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:24.360
Sweet!

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.700
That's one of the strands that we just left in,

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.300
It looks like it broke -

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:31.100
oh, wow, listen to that.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.000
*clinks*

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.620
That actually sounds like glass.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.700
If you put this in your hands, can you squish it?

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.640
*crunch noises*

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.740
Oop! It went down my shirt.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.240
Now just for fun, I whipped up a few more colors of slime

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.680
to make rainbow slime,

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.760
and wondered what these would look like once they're dipped in liquid nitrogen?

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:01.960
Here we go

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.120
I'm feeling it

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:06.500
Oh, look at that!

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.500
Like, the instant it touches the top of that fog,

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.540
it just starts vaping like crazy,

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.580
That's cool. That's cool!

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.720
And we're about to make contact.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.480
There we go.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:31.100
That's so cool! Look at how that's all blended into a nice rainbow color

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.380
So you can see this is all still really slimy.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.620
Down here starts getting a little rubbery.

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:37.320
Let's go ahead and pull the whole thing out

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.500
and see how the entire piece looks.

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.020
Wow!

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.800
Okay, that's kind of cool.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.240
Look at the colors!

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.320
So it's gone from being, like, super shiny

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.780
and glossy to almost looking like frozen chocolate.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.360
These colors have really firmed up and gone opaque.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.320
You can see the way, like, it just started freezing as it was sitting in the cup there.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.520
This stuff here is still really slimy,

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.300
and then there's a transition point where it gets really rubbery.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.280
It's like the consistency of a rubber tire.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.940
But then everything after that just gets extremely brittle.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.520
It just shatters.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.720
Tell me that doesn't look cool.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:21.360
Oh, yeah!

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.820
Check that out, that is awesome!

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.580
It's like a giant rainbow tongue.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.160
So I've still got a little bit of my rainbow slime left over

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.280
and a little bit of liquid nitrogen,

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.920
so I'm just going to ball this stuff up

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.140
and throw it all in there at the same time.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.260
Let's do the drop!

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:37.760
Three

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:38.440
Two

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:39.240
One

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.640
What do you say we just give this like,

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.600
thirty-five, forty seconds to soak and then pull it out and take a look?

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:49.400
It's already hard on the outer layer.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.840
I'm gonna see if I can grab it with my hands.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.220
Whoo!

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:57.260
Sweet

00:09:58.460 --> 00:09:59.860
Looks like a big Play-doh turd...

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.500
If we crack it open, oh look it's still got a gummy, slimy interior.

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.080
It just froze on the outer layers here,

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.340
but it's still, like, super gummy on the inside.

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:16.180
Mmm, it's chewy.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.820
It's too bad, something that looks this good should be edible.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.540
Let's put this one in.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.120
Oh, I love that

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:29.880
Like, the second it hits the top layer it just starts vaping like crazy.

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:33.820
Sounds like popcorn popping.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:38.300
Look at the way it cracks, like the more it freezes the more it cracks

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:39.400
right down the center.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:42.020
It looks like it's frozen solid.

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.500
Oh, nope, there's still a little bit of gummy there in the middle.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:45.380
Look at that.

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:48.980
Oh, just like that one little piece, that's all there is.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.300
Now over time these chunks will warm back up

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.220
and turn back into that gooey slime,

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:58.600
but it's going to take a couple of hours at these temperatures.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.280
So there you have it, guys.

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.980
That's what happens when you put slime in liquid nitrogen.

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:05.580
So thanks again to Muskaan Sanya for the request,
