00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.160
Can’t seem to get down to your ideal weight?

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:09.130
Sadly, you can’t blame your metabolism.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.150
Hey guys, Amy here on DNews talking about
metabolism.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.450
We hear a lot about metabolism, mainly in
the form of people blaming a slowing metabolism

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.250
for weight gain as they get older.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.480
But what exactly is your metabolism, and can
you do anything to change it?

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.870
Metabolism is the biochemical process by which
your body converts the foods you eat into

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.960
energy, but it’s more than fueling an active
lifestyle.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.649
There are a lot of “hidden” processes
going on in your body all the time that require

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.690
energy, the basic functions you don’t think
about like breathing, circulating blood throughout

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.870
your body, adjusting hormone levels, and growing
and repairing cells.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.780
The calories in food and drinks combine with
oxygen to release the energy your body needs

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:44.780
to function.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.760
The calories your body needs to power these
basic functions tells you your basal metabolic

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.650
rate, the base rate at which your body uses
calories for fuel, and it’s wholly separate

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.190
from any active aspects of your lifestyle.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.270
Basal metabolic rate is properly the amount
of energy your body expends at rest in a neutrally

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.350
temperate environment so when you’re not
shivering or sweating, and in a post-absorptive

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.459
state, that is, when the digestive system
is inactive, so typically after fasting for

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:08.770
about 12 hours.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.700
In this completely passive, almost weakened
state, you can determine the absolute minimal

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.840
number of calories your body needs to function.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.369
It’s a number that depends on your body
size and composition, your gender, and even

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:19.369
your age.

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:20.950
And it can change over time.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.599
As we get older and have less lean muscle
on our bones, your basal metabolic rate can

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:25.599
slow down.

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:26.599
But don’t worry!

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:30.009
You can help your metabolism along just a
little bit with everybody’s favourite: diet

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:31.009
and exercise.

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:32.619
Sadly there’s no magic formula.

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.229
Your body burns more calories to maintain
lean muscle than fat, so people you might

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.289
think of as having a fast metabolism might
just be more active, or even just more fidgety

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:41.289
than others.

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:44.549
So if you want to increase the rate at which
your body burns calories, building muscle

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.429
through strength training and increasing your
cardiovascular workouts will certainly help,

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:52.259
as will any increased physical activity like
taking the long route on your walk home or

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.270
taking the stairs instead of the elevator.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.399
There are a few things you can do diet-wise
to help.

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.600
Eating more often can actually help you lose
weight by keeping your body working throughout

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.909
the day metabolizing calories into energy
burning more calories.

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.109
It can also help you eat less at mealtimes
so you’re taking in fewer calories in general.

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:08.739
Spicy foods can help.

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.799
They have natural chemicals that can kick
your metabolism into high gear though the

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:13.340
boost might be short lived.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.720
Your body also burns more calories digesting
protein than fatty foods or carbohydrates.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.549
Eating lean beef, turkey, fish, white meat
chicken, tofu, nuts, beans, eggs, and low-fat

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:24.939
dairy products can boost your metabolism.

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:28.159
But at the end of the day, there are genetic
and lifestyle factors that you can’t help.

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:31.049
The best thing to do is to eat right and work
out, increasing the number of calories your

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.079
body burns compared to the calories you’re
taking in.

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:42.069
So, are you guys moved to start taking the
hard steps to help your metabolism along?
