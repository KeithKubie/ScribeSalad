00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:05,760
[inaudible]

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,450
the day that thougth invented writing
famous warned him that he discovered a

3
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:12,090
drug that would make people
lose touch with themselves.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,020
If you're still watching, you took
thoughts, pill in software yourself.

5
00:00:16,021 --> 00:00:20,190
The effects it really had. It started
with visual depictions of the world.

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,330
Pictographs signs for ideas
and thoughts, idiot graphs.

7
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,440
Then a transformation from picture
writing to true writing with symbols that

8
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:28,700
stand out

9
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,660
for words, logo, graphs, using
those words. Symbols to Sanford,

10
00:00:32,661 --> 00:00:34,820
similar sounding words. Rebus.

11
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,690
Then those sound alikes became
syllable characters, sullen berries,

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,250
continent characters, object ads, and
then consonant and vowel characters,

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,510
alphabets or even constant and
val syllables or Facila Berries,

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,040
and if things get really linguistic
savvy off of that to become all featural

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,580
characters grouped by their
phonetic properties along the way,

16
00:00:55,581 --> 00:00:57,920
writing had to deal with
tensions and take sides.

17
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,380
Should it represent meanings or sounds?

18
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:04,790
Should it benefit the reader or the
writer contained maximum information about

19
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:08,240
every sound or just enough to
recognize the shape of a word?

20
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:11,810
Should it be flexible and
creative or rigid and consistent?

21
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:16,070
How do physical techniques shape
it? Oh Hen who did it first?

22
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,540
Who did it best.

23
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,020
Maybe you've learned to make some
sense out of the chaotic noise of world

24
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,123
writing.

25
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,280
Maybe you can appreciate some of the
problems each one solves the traditions

26
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,800
that captures the ambiguity's at creates,

27
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,120
or perhaps it's more comfortable just
to close your eyes and wake up back at

28
00:01:33,121 --> 00:01:33,720
home.

29
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,200
Looking at your familiar characters of
your familiar writing system plastered

30
00:01:37,201 --> 00:01:38,730
across your favorite websites.

31
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,750
Still somehow you can't even
look at that the same way.

32
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:46,620
It's just one invention among many
in the long history of this language

33
00:01:46,621 --> 00:01:48,660
technology we call fighting

34
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:02,730
[inaudible].
