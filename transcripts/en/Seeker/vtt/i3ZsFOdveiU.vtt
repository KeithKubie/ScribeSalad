00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:01.960
How do microwaves cook your food?

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.570
If you stand in front of a microwave are you
going to get cancer?

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:13.930
Are they killing you?!

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.370
Howdy cookers, thanks for watching DNews,
I'm Trace.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:22.340
This morning, I was talking to our intern
Tori // hello! // about how I microwaved coffee

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.340
from yesterday.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.369
Yeah, I know, it's gross.

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.060
But it's SO EASY!

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.509
Microwaves are magic food boxes.

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.930
They heat food in less time with less energy
than traditional methods -- but HOW they make

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.090
that thing hotter is a mystery to many of
it's users...

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.820
The microwave has roots in radar research
during World War II.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.380
Scientist Percy Spencer accidentally melted
a candybar in his pocket and after some more

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.400
experimentation, he patented[a] the first
microwave heating device!

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.800
Microwaves are basically metal boxes containing
a magnetron gun.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.760
The magnetron uses electricity to excite electrons
and get them to vibrate and release waves

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.800
of non-ionized electromagnetic energy.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.950
This radiation is at a frequency that's between
radio waves and infrared light -- usually

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.890
around 2.45 gigahertz.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.030
This microwave "radiation" is no different
from the radiation created by a radio station

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.720
or a wifi-network.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.650
The literal microwaves are made of alternating
current, and magnetic fields.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.670
Because it's Alternating it means they're
switching from clockwise to counterclockwise

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:23.670
back and forth.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.740
These electromagnetic waves shoot from the
magnetron into the oven passing through paper,

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.930
plastic, and glass to hit the water, fat and
sugar molecules in your cup of coffee or frozen

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.600
burrito.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.940
Scientists aren't EXACTLY sure what happens
at this point.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.430
Either the waves cause the H2O molecules to
agitate and generate heat, OR the fats, sugars

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.560
and water absorb the energy and release heat.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.370
Either way, when the magnetron energy hits,
heat is created, and a minute or so later,

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.250
yesterday's coffee is as good asâ€¦ well yesterday's
coffee.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.300
Only hotter.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.840
Because it's just heating water, fat and sugar
-- if it's not evenly distributed throughout

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.680
the burrito, it won't heat well!

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.310
Cold patch, yuck...

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.840
Also, setting it too hot too fast will only
mess up the process because the heat has to

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.241
travel into the food by conduction, that is,
one molecule spreads heat to the next and

00:02:14.241 --> 00:02:15.241
then the next.

00:02:15.241 --> 00:02:16.319
What a pain in the butt.

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:22.400
My mom used to tell me, "If you want children
someday don't stand too close to the microwave!"

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.279
Which isn't really true.

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:31.779
This microwave radiation isn't nearly as strong
an an x-ray, or as common as wifi, cell phone,

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:35.599
televisions or other electromagnetic waves
flying around.

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:39.550
Studies have found low-level microwave exposure
shouldn't cause the corruption of DNA that

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.550
results in cancer.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:46.329
And looking into the microwave is fine, the
windows are shielded so microwaves are reflecting

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:47.450
onto the food, not into your sensitive little
eyeballs.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.829
Metal in the microwave, isn't inherently bad,
either.

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:53.849
After all, the walls are made of it because
it reflects the waves all around, heating

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.579
as much of the food as possible.

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:01.200
However, throwing in something POINTY, like
aluminum foil, can cause sparks, and breakdown

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.309
of air molecules into more dangerous fumes.

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:09.099
The sleeves that come with some pastries are
also for reflection, because as the outside

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.730
of the food heats up, that heat energy is
reflected BACK at the crust, crisping it up.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.129
It's cooking itself!

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:19.029
Whether microwaving is damaging the food is
still being debated by science, but for the

00:03:19.029 --> 00:03:24.859
most part ANY cooking damages the nutrient
content of the "raw" food, but cooking it

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.590
also kills bacteria which makes food safer.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.150
Yes, a few older studies found breast milk,
heated in a microwave, lost some of it's vitamin

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.150
B12 potency.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.849
But many other studies have found no such
evidence.

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:41.239
And MANY studies done on microwaves have determined
there's little or no difference between microwaving

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:42.569
and conventional cooking.

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.469
Ultimately, the most dangerous things microwaves
produce are food burns from overheating the

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:48.469
item.

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:50.510
And that's just your fault.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.459
The FDA says microwaving food is just as safe
and nutritious as any other method of cooking.

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:55.670
But what do you think?

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.680
Are you nervous about them?

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.519
Do you microwave your food?

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.109

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:07.370
Microwaves are also produced in space, and
on Wednesday, August 27 we're doing our next

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.790
monthly SpaceOut with NASA/JPL!

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.250
This month we're talking about Europa, the
possibility of life and future missions to

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.130
Jupiter's intriguing moon!

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.680
RSVP with the link here or in the description
and post a question so we can ask the experts!

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.200
Thanks for watching DNews.
