00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.340
In the realm of classic action films and romantic
comedies, there�s a time and a place for

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.910
sappy dialogue and groan-inducing one-liners.
But sometimes, a cheesy quote can put all

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.110
others to shame � even worse in movies where
they feel entirely out of place. They�re

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.369
not all bad, but even the good ones deserve
some recognition. Here are Screen Rant�s

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:26.890
10 Cheesy Quotes in Popular Movies.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.119
Armageddon

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:34.390
Back when Ben Affleck was best known for underwhelming
romantic comedies, joining forces with director

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.510
Michael Bay led to some less-than-surprising
results. Butting heads over his boss's daughter

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:49.089
led to plenty of laughs, but when Affleck
was asked to deliver some romance before heading

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:53.449
into space to save the world, he swung for
the fences, delivering one of the cheesiest

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:59.860
lines in his - and Bay's - entire career.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:00.860
Top Gun

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.410
Not every cheesy movie line has to be a bad
one, and Top Gun has plenty to choose from.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.740
The classic fighter pilot action movie is
filled to the brim with egos, macho rivals,

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.520
and out of control bromances. But when the
film�s hero Maverick and his nemesis Iceman

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.251
join forces in the final act, the film�s
ending leaves every eye-rolling moment before

00:01:19.251 --> 00:01:27.780
it in the dust (�You can be my wingman anytime�
�Bullshit�you can be mine�).

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.780
The Wedding Singer

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.601
It seems every Adam Sandler movie must have
a sappy, sentimental moment or two, and The

00:01:32.601 --> 00:01:36.560
Wedding Singer�s came in the form of a sugary
sweet love song. Based on a scene between

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.729
Sandler and Barrymore earlier in the film,
�I Wanna Grow Old With You� is intentionally

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:48.640
cheesy 
and sentimental. Unlike other Sandler films,

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.609
however, it manages to do justice to the movie�s
setting, offering an ending right at home

00:01:52.609 --> 00:02:00.850
among the cheesiest love stories of the 1980s.
We�ll allow it.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:01.850
The Matrix

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.479
It's star Keanu Reeves who gets the most criticism
for his dialogue in The Matrix, but he can't

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.820
take credit for the cheesiest. That honor
goes to Trinity, played by Carrie-Anne Moss.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.610
When Neo is shot dead inside the digital world,
Trinity tells him that he must go on fighting,

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.530
thanks to a prophecy claiming that the man
she loved would save humanity (�so you see,

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.110
you can�t be dead��). In a movie about
killer machines, the life-giving kiss and

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.310
fireworks are overkill, to say the least.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.310
Judge Dredd

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.460
As an action star of the 1980s and '90s, Sylvester
Stallone spoke too many groan-inducing punchlines

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.470
to count. From incredibly cool to downright
corny, most can be forgiven - but when playing

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.120
the policeman, judge, and executioner Judge
Dredd, Stallone turned the motto of a dystopic

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:57.570
police state into a laughable catchphrase
so cheesy, he should have locked himself up.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:08.840
Thankfully, Karl Urban would deliver the line
as intended in 2012's Dredd.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.620
As Good as it Gets

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.420
This romantic comedy gets singled out for
one of the sappier lines delivered by Jack

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.480
Nicholson, explaining that Helen Hunt�s
character makes him �want to be a better

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.590
man.� But in the context of the story and
the scene, the line actually makes sense.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.900
The same can�t be said for the line that
appears not long after. A beautiful woman

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.570
inspiring Greg Kinnear�s character to pick
up pencil and paper is believable, but his

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.070
description his compliment is too manufactured
and cheesy for ANY human being to deliver

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.200
with a straight face.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.200
Van Helsing

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.840
Hugh Jackman�s role as medieval monster-hunter
Van Helsing was one of the actor�s most

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.230
forgettable, looking to cash in on his fame
AND the rise of supernatural action films.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.201
But the movie�s ending is one for the ages.
When his leading lady dies in his werewolf

00:03:54.201 --> 00:03:58.430
arms, Van Helsing�s werewolf-to-human howl
is cheesy enough to pull ANY viewer out of

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.760
the story. Just for good measure, the next
scene doubles down on the melodrama, showing

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.820
her spirit reunited with her deceased family,
shedding a single heavenly tear to guarantee

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.430
Van Helsing went from underwhelming to ridiculous.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.070
The Fast &amp; The Furious

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.781
To prove just how unpredictable street racer
Dominic Toretto really is, he confesses to

00:04:17.781 --> 00:04:24.090
living his life �a quarter mile at a time,"
and forgetting his troubles when going head

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.830
to head with a fellow racer. Aside from the
painfully forced racing reference that comes

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.919
completely out of nowhere, it doesn't even
seem accurate. Future films would show that

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:37.320
Dom cared fairly little about racing, traveling
around the globe to defend his family and

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.409
friends � the things that really mattered
to him. Apparently, the filmmakers loved this

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:44.060
cheesy catchphrase too much to care.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.620
Star War: Revenge of the Sith

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.690
Of all the Star Wars prequels, it was the
third and final that fans most eagerly awaited,

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.789
promised to see Anakin Skywalker long-awaited
transformation into Darth Vader. It�s hard

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:58.680
to forget the scars and lost limbs delivered
at the hands of his former mentor Obi-Wan

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.180
Kenobi, which would make him rely on his famous
armor and helmet just to keep him alive. Anakin�s

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.790
shift to the Dark Side was completed when
he learned that his wife and children had

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:16.510
been lost - letting out one of the cheesiest
screams in movie history as a result. We couldn�t

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.350
agree more.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.120
Indiana Jones &amp; The Kingdom of the Crystal
Skull

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.410
Fans made their feelings about the fourth
Indiana Jones movie known as soon as it was

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:30.169
released, criticizing the overused CGI, the
alien twist ending, and the reveal that �50s

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:34.650
greaser �Mutt Williams� was really Indy�s
son, Henry Jones the Third. Ending the film

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.360
with a wedding so sweet it gave longtime fans
a toothache, Harrison Ford and Shia LaBeouf

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:49.169
put the final nail in the coffin with the
film�s cheesiest line and moment of all.

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:53.381
