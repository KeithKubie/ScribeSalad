Hi there! My name is John Green; this is Crash
Course World History, and today we’re going

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.139
to talk about the Crusades. Ohhh, Stan, do
we have to talk about the Crusades? I hate them...

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:12.299
Here’s the thing about the Crusades, which
were a series of military expeditions from

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:16.209
parts of Europe to the Eastern coast of the
Mediterranean. The real reason they feature

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:22.580
so prominently in history is because we’ve
endlessly romanticized the story of the Crusades.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.849
We’ve created this simple narrative with
characters to root for and root against, and

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.919
it’s all been endlessly idealized by the
likes of Sir Walter Scott. And there are knights

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:35.039
with swords and lion hearts... NO, STAN. LIONHEARTS.
Thank you.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:43.900
[theme music]

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.100
Let’s start by saying that initially the
Crusades were not a “holy war” on the

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.960
part of Europeans against Islam, but in important
ways the Crusades were driven by religious faith.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.990
Past John: Mr. Green, Mr. Green! Religion
causes all wars. Imagine no war —

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.830
I’m gonna cut you off right there before
you violate copyright, me-from-the-past. But

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:05.250
as usual, you’re wrong. Simple readings
of history are rarely sufficient. By the way,

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.040
when did my handwriting get so much better?

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.060
I mean, if the Crusades had been brought on
by the lightning-fast rise of the Islamic

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.619
empire and a desire to keep in Christian hands
the land of Jesus, then the Crusades would’ve

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.499
started in the 8th century. But early Islamic
dynasties, like the Umayyads and the Abbasids,

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:22.249
were perfectly happy with Christians and Jews
living among them, as long as they paid a

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:26.399
tax. And plus the Christian pilgrimage business
was awesome for the Islamic Empire’s economy.

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:30.079
But then a new group of Muslims, the Seljuk
Turks, moved into the region and they sacked

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.299
the holy cities and made it much more difficult
for Christians to make their pilgrimages.

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.699
And while they quickly realized their mistake,
it was already too late. The Byzantines, who’d had their

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.300
literal-asses kicked at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071,
felt the threat and called upon the West for help.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.820
So the first official crusade began with a
call to arms from Pope Urban II in 1095 CE.

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.340
This was partly because Urban wanted to unite
Europe and he’d figured out the lesson the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.130
rest of us learn from alien invasion movies:
the best way to get people to unite is to

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.030
give them a common enemy. So Urban called
on all the bickering knights and nobility

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.039
of Europe, and he saideth unto his people:
“Let us go forth and help the Byzantines

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.600
because then maybe they will acknowledge my
awesomeness and get rid of their stupid Not

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.920
Having Me as Pope thing, and while we are at it,
let’s liberate Jerusalem!” I’m paraphrasing, by the way.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.320
Shifting the focus to Jerusalem is really
important, because the Crusades were not primarily

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.470
military operations; they were pilgrimages.
Theologically, Christianity didn’t have

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.160
an idea of a holy war – like, war might
be just, but fighting wasn’t something that

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.000
got you into heaven. But pilgrimage to a holy
shrine could help you out on that front, and

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.140
Urban had the key insight to pitch the Crusade
as a pilgrimage with a touch of warring on

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.140
the side. I do the same thing to my kid every
night: I’m not feeding you dinner featuring

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.600
animal crackers. I’m feeding you animal crackers
featuring a dinner. Oh, it’s time for the open letter?

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.920
An Open Letter to Animal Crackers.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.620
But first let’s see what’s in the Secret
Compartment today. Oh, it’s animal crackers.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.820
Thanks, Stan...

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.030
Hi there, Animal Crackers, it’s me, John
Green. Thanks for being delicious, but let

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.680
me throw out a crazy idea here: Maybe foods
that are ALREADY DELICIOUS do not need the

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.150
added benefit of being PLEASINGLY SHAPED.
I mean, why can’t I give my kid animal spinach

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.200
or animal sweet potato or even animal cooked
animal? I mean, we can put a man on Mars but

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.040
we can’t make spinach shaped like elephants?
What Stan? We haven’t put a man on Mars?

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.440
Stupid world, always disappointing me.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.020
Best wishes, John Green

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.040
One last myth to dispel: The Crusades also
were NOT an early example of European colonization

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.800
of the Middle East, even if they did create
some European-ish kingdoms there for a while.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.480
That's a much later, post-and-anti-colonialist view that
comes, at least partially, from a Marxist reading of history.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.300
In the case of the Crusades, it was argued,
the knights who went adventuring in the Levant

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.810
were the second and third sons of wealthy
nobles who, because of European inheritance

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.360
rules, had little to look forward to by staying
in Europe and lots to gain – in terms of

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.340
plunder – by going to the East. Cool theory,
bro, but it’s not true. First, most of the

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.450
people who responded to the call to Crusade
weren’t knights at all; they were poor people.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.550
And secondly, most of the nobles who did go
crusading were lords of estates, not their wastrel kids.

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.470
But more importantly, that analysis ignores
religious motivations. We’ve approached

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.500
religions as historical phenomena — thinking
about how, for instance, the capricious environment

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:19.109
of Mesopotamia led to a capricious cadre of
Mesopotamian gods. But just as the world shapes

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.009
religion, religion also shapes the world.

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:24.610
And some modern historians might ignore religious
motivations, but medieval crusaders sure as

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.610
hell didn’t. I mean, when people came up
with that idiom, they clearly thought Hell

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.110
was for sure. To the Crusaders, they were
taking up arms to protect Christ and his kingdom.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.840
And what better way to show your devotion
to God than putting a cross on your sleeve, spending

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.259
5 to 6 times your annual income to outfit yourself
and all your horses, and heading for the Holy Land?

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:45.110
So when these people cried out “God Wills
It!” to explain their reasons for going,

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.979
we should do them the favor of believing them.
And the results of the First Crusade seemed

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:52.960
to indicate that God had willed it. Following
the lead of roving preachers with names like

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.030
Peter the Rabbit- Peter the Hermit? Stan,
you’re always making history less cool!

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.819
Fine, following preachers like Peter the Hermit,
thousands of peasants and nobles alike volunteered

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.979
for the First Crusade. It got off to kind of a rough start
because pilgrims kept robbing those they encountered

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:12.039
on the way. Plus, there was no real leader
so they were constant rivalries between nobles

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:16.399
about who could supply the most troops. Notable
among the notables were Godfrey of Bouillon,

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.020
Bohemond of Taranto, and Raymond of Toulouse.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.080
But despite the rivalries, and the disorganization
the crusaders were remarkably — some would

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.770
say miraculously — successful. By the time
they arrived in the Levant, they were fighting

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.520
not against the Seljuk Turks but against Fatimid
Egyptians, who had captured the Holy Land

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.219
from the Seljuks, thereby making the Turks
none too pleased with the Egyptians. At Antioch

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:40.409
the Crusaders reversed a seemingly hopeless
situation when a peasant found a spear that

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:44.509
had pierced the side of Christ’s side hidden
under a church, thereby raising morale enough

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:50.319
to win the day. And then they did the impossible:
They took Jerusalem, securing it for Christendom

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:53.050
and famously killing a lot of people in the
al-Asqa mosque.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.680
Now the Crusaders succeeded in part because
the Turkish Muslims, who were Sunnis, did

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.360
not step up to help the Egyptians, who were
Shia. But that kind of complicated, intra-Islamic

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.919
rivalry gets in the way of the awesome narrative:
The Christians just saw it as a miracle.

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:10.580
So by 1100CE European nobles held both Antioch
and Jerusalem as Latin Christian kingdoms.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.260
I say Latin to make the point that there were
lots of Christians living in these cities before the

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:19.540
Crusaders arrived, they just weren’t Catholic -- they were
Orthodox, a point that will become relevant shortly.

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.219
We’re going to skip the second Crusade because
it bores me and move on to the Third Crusade

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:27.340
because it’s the famous one. Broadly speaking,
the Third Crusade was a European response

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:32.430
to the emergence of a new Islamic power, neither
Turkish nor Abbasid: the Egyptian (although

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:39.840
he was really a Kurd) Sultan al-Malik al-Nasir
Salah ed-Din Yusuf, better known to the west as Saladin.

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:44.370
Saladin, having consolidating his power in
Egypt, sought to expand by taking Damascus

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:49.699
and, eventually Jerusalem, which he did successfully,
because he was an amazing general. And then

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:53.559
the loss of Jerusalem caused Pope Gregory
VIII to call for a third crusade. Three of

00:06:53.559 --> 00:06:57.650
the most important kings in Europe answered
the call: Philip "cowardly schemer" the Second

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:02.180
of France, Richard "Lionheart" the First of
England, and Frederick “I am going to drown

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:07.339
anticlimactically on the journey while trying
to bathe in a river” Barbarossa of the not-holy,

00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:12.400
not-roman, and not-imperial Holy Roman Empire.
Both Richard and Saladin were great generals

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.069
who earned the respect of their troops.

00:07:14.069 --> 00:07:17.599
And while from the European perspective the
crusade was a failure because they didn’t

00:07:17.599 --> 00:07:23.129
take Jerusalem, it did radically change crusading
forever by making Egypt a target. Richard

00:07:23.129 --> 00:07:27.770
understood that the best chance to take Jerusalem
involved first taking Egypt, but he couldn’t

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:32.650
convince any crusaders to join him because Egypt had
a lot less religious value to Christians than Jerusalem.

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:36.139
So Richard was forced to call off the Crusade
early, but if he had just hung around until

00:07:36.139 --> 00:07:40.529
Easter of 1192, he would’ve seen Saladin
die. And then Richard probably could have

00:07:40.529 --> 00:07:44.380
fulfilled all his crusading dreams, but then,
you know, we wouldn’t have needed the 4th Crusade.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:48.159
Although crusading continued throughout the
14th century, mostly with an emphasis on North

00:07:48.159 --> 00:07:52.520
Africa and not the Holy Land, the 4th Crusade
is the last one we’ll focus on, because

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:55.060
it was the crazy one. Let’s go to the
Thought Bubble.

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:59.360
So a lot of people volunteered for the fourth
crusade — more than 35,000 — and the generals

00:07:59.369 --> 00:08:03.009
didn’t want to march them all the way across
Anatolia, because they knew from experience

00:08:03.009 --> 00:08:08.580
that it was A. dangerous and B. hot, so they
decided to go by boat, which necessitated

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:12.270
the building of the largest naval fleet Europe
had seen since the Roman Empire.

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:17.719
The Venetians built 500 ships, but then only
11,000 Crusaders actually made it down to

00:08:17.719 --> 00:08:22.439
Venice, because, like, oh I meant to go but
I had a thing come up... etc. There wasn’t

00:08:22.439 --> 00:08:26.619
enough money to pay for those boats, so the
Venetians made the Crusaders a deal: Help

00:08:26.619 --> 00:08:31.919
us capture the rebellious city of Zara, and
we’ll ferry you to Anatolia.

00:08:31.919 --> 00:08:36.620
This was a smidge problematic, Crusading-wise,
because Zara was a Christian city, but the

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:41.620
Crusaders agreed to help, resulting in the
Pope excommunicating both them and the Venetians.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:45.959
Then after the Crusaders failed to take Zara
and were still broke, a would-be Byzantine

00:08:45.959 --> 00:08:51.620
emperor named Alexius III promised the Crusaders
he would pay them if they helped him out,

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:56.899
so the (excommunicated) Catholic Crusaders
fought on behalf of the Orthodox Alexius,

00:08:56.899 --> 00:09:01.130
who soon became emperor in Constantinople.
But it took Alexius a while to come up with

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:04.790
the money he’d promised the Crusaders, so
they were waiting around in Constantinople,

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:09.529
and then Alexius was suddenly dethroned by
the awesomely named Mourtzouphlos, leaving

00:09:09.529 --> 00:09:12.680
the crusaders stuck in Constantinople with
no money.

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.980
Christian holy warriors couldn’t very well
sack the largest city in Christendom, could

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:20.570
they? Well, it turns out they could and boy,
did they. They took all the wealth they could

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:25.120
find, killed and raped Christians as they
went, stole the statues of horses that now

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:30.960
adorn St. Mark’s Cathedral in Venice, and retook exactly
none of the Holy Land. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:35.570
So you’d think this disaster would discredit
the whole notion of Crusading, right? No.

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:39.339
Instead, it legitimatized the idea that Crusading
didn’t have to be about pilgrimage: that

00:09:39.339 --> 00:09:41.600
any enemies of the Catholic Church were fair
game.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:45.930
Also, the fourth crusade pretty much doomed
the Byzantine Empire, which never really recovered.

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:51.399
Constantinople, a shadow of its former self,
was conquered by the Turks in 1453. So ultimately

00:09:51.399 --> 00:09:56.350
the Crusades were a total failure at establishing
Christian kingdoms in the Holy Land long term.

00:09:56.350 --> 00:10:00.740
And with the coming of the Ottomans, the region
remained solidly Muslim, as it (mostly) is today.

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:04.190
And the Crusades didn’t really open up lines
of communication between the Christian and

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:08.670
Muslim worlds, because those lines of communication
were already open. Plus, most historians now

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:12.850
agree that the Crusades didn’t bring Europe
out of the Middle Ages by offering it contact

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:16.410
with the superior intellectual accomplishments
of the Islamic world. In fact, they were a

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:18.380
tremendous drain on Europe’s resources.

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:22.360
For me, the Crusades matter because they remind
us that the medieval world was fundamentally

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:26.490
different from ours. The men and women who
took up the cross believed in the sacrality

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:31.050
of their work in a way that we often can’t
conceive of today. And when we focus so much

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:35.500
on the heroic narrative or the anti-imperialist
narrative, or all the political in-fighting,

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:39.470
we can lose sight of what the Crusades must
have meant to the Crusaders. How the journey

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:44.420
from pilgrimage to holy war transformed their
faith and their lives. And ultimately, that

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:49.780
exercise in empathy is the coolest thing about studying
history. Thanks for watching. I’ll see you next week.
