00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.600
Tamara: You know those tedious 9-to-5 office jobs that everyone finds so boring?

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:48.500
Malcolm: Yeah.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.400
Tamara: I envy those.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.900
Malcolm: Yeah.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.100
Malcolm: What the hell is that?

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.400
Tamara: When did Cinema Snob become Buddhist?

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.100
NC: Greetings, humble mortals.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.500
Welcome to inner peace.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.500
Malcolm: Critic, what the hell is going on?

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.900
Tamara: Yeah, what's with the getup, and why the shaved head?

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.000
Malcolm: Shaved head?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.400
You mean he had hair before?

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.700
NC: Normally, a line like that would force me to thrash you,

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.100
but I have achieved enlightenment.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.100
Tamara: Really?

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.300
And how did you do that?

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.000
NC: I have seen the ultimate bad movie.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
After 10 years of seeing crap,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.100
I have finally come across a film so terrible it has lifted me to a higher plane.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.200
I can bring about peace when there is none

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.400
and even predict Transformers movies without having to see them.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.200
Tamara: Okay, Critic. We'll bite.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.000
Which movie gave you this enlightenment?

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.400
NC: Rob Schneider's...

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.000
Tamara: Sounds right.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.300
NC: ...and the studio that brought you all the Barbie movies...

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.400
Malcolm: Sounds doubly right.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.900
NC: Norm of the North.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.100
Tamara and Malcolm: Yep.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.000
NC: That's right.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.400
After 10 years of doing this,

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.700
I'm finally giving in and reviewing the film I've gotten countless requests to review.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.400
With some exceptions, I like the movies I've reviewed that have some sort of nostalgic connection,

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.800
whether it come out years ago or was based on nostalgic property.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.300
This, however, has no nostalgic connection,

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.500
no nostalgic characters,

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.800
it's not even that old.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.200
But I'm gonna review it in honor of you guys watching for 10 incredible years.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.700
So, let's get ready to watch a film so terrible

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.500
it can bring you into a whole new realm of reality.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.300
Hey.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.400
Aren't you guys gonna get ready for the sketches?

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.200
Tamara: Oh, we'd like to, but...

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.800
oh, man, those clips you showed us really...

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.200
brought us to enlightenment already.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.500
Malcolm: Yeah, me, too.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.100
We're not just taking it easy because we worked our asses off in the Wonder Woman review.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.600
Tamara: No.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.400
NC: I understand.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.400
Be at peace in your new enlightened state-

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.900
Tamara: We'll do it better if you stop yapping.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:50.600
NC: Oh! Sorry.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.300
Tamara: We don't care.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.000
NC: By popular demand,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.900
this is Norm of the North.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.800
The film opens with music that's trying WAY too hard for a Rob Schneider project.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.200
This literally has farting lemmings, composer.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.600
You do not want to waste your A material on this.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.600
We see our main character Norm,

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.600
played by human shrug Rob Schneider,

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.800
as he mumbles to himself arguably what the real Rob Schneider mumbles to himself every morning.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.600
Norm: (whispering) Don't listen to the haters, Norm. You got this!

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.200
Caribou: Read 'em and weep boys!

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.600
Cari-booyah!

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.000
NC: Okay, let's play a game.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.780
I'm sure you're already playing it at home.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Okay, let's see.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.800
Norm is obviously the lion from Madagascar who doesn't fit in.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.600
Caribou #2: I knew he wouldn't kill the seal.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.400
NC: Ah! We got the Brother Bear moose.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.400
Both of them, actually.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.500
Ohhhh, and the annoying testicles!

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.400
*snickering* Oh, come on!

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.800
You know, the annoying testicles.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.800
They're everywhere!

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.300
There's the Simpsons ones in Despicable Me,

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.000
the ginger-crap ones from Brave,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
the petting zoo of annoyance from Lorax,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.300
the black-and-white and overused-all-over-from-Madagascar penguins,

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.200
the Wile E. Coyote one from Ice Age.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.500
In fact, let's steal their backgrounds, too, while we're at it.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.300
As well as their inability to bring joy.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.000
And now, here's a terrifying combination of all of them

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
with these Bigfoot testicles known as

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.800
the lemmings.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.400
Who, sadly, do not jump off a cliff in this movie.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.500
Oh, sure, you'll be authentic on that detail.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.500
Oh, let's not forget the generic female support

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.800
who's so essential to this movie she LITERALLY only has one word in a scene.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.600
Elizabeth: Hi.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.200
NC: And we hit that check mark.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.800
That means we're a real movie now!

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.500
Let's celebrate with a shitty transition not like a real movie.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.500
Female Tourist: EAT HIM!

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.700
Norm: You wanna know why I'm not gonna eat you?

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:34.220
You got a minute?

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.200
Well, maybe an hour.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.500
NC: (as Norm) Or a better writer?

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.500
Do you have a better writer?

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.800
'Cause this so isn't flowing.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.600
NC: (normal) So, Norm reveals that he can talk with humans,

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.400
and he's the only polar bear who can apparently do it.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.500
Little Norm: Can't you see we're wild animals here?

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.100
Girl: Did you just talk to me?

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.000
NC: How does he have that magical power?

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.400
Norm: And certainly no other bear had these weird feelings that I had.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.600
NC: So he sees the king of the Arctic who also happens to be his grandpa.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.600
Grandfather: I, too, can speak to our human visitors.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.400
Polar bears are icons of the Arctic, Norm.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.100
And an icon with a voice can be very powerful indeed.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.000
NC: Yeah, that's our shitty way of saying,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000
"We just can."

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.900
But at least our powerful icons are used for lame movies and annoying ad campaigns.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.000
NC: Would you watch Norm of the North?

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Jeff Burton: Not a chance.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.800
NC: Oh, he also discovers he likes dancing.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.700
Because they want to see if they can turn this:

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:34.500
into this:

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.500
Christ, everything in this movie's a ripoff.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.400
Even this scene looks like a Coke commercial.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.300
But it's the crappy second-rate version, so it would probably be this:

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:42.600
In fact, I just realized.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.700
You know how there's always a bad asylum knockoff film

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.600
every single time an animated flick comes out?

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:48.500
Like,

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.100
EVERY animated flick?

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.500
Norm of the North doesn't have one.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.700
That's how bad it is.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.700
It's own asylum knockoff!

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.300
This has been foretold in the Apocalypse.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.800
He has a brother named Stan, played by Gabriel Iglesias.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.200
He's in this scene, and...

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:03.900
that's it.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.300
Stan: Let me give you some advice, bro.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.200
Act with your stomach, and not your heart.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.200
NC: (as Iglesias) Now, if you'll excuse me,

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.300
I'm to escape this movie so my talents are wasted in higher material.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.900
Including Nut Job 2,

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:14.900
Annoying Orange,

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:15.400
and...

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.200
Holy shit!

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.500
How the hell did I get that?!

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.200
(normal) He likes to put on a show for the tourists,

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.700
including lemmings in tuxes,

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.000
seals in ice cannons,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000
and twerking whales.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.300
You know, this movie's only ten minutes in,

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.900
and it's already created two new commandments:

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:31.900
No twerking whales

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.400
and no saying you're not gonna do something followed by a scene of you immediately doing it.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.800
Norm: The Arctic Shake was for your bachelor party.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.000
I'd never do that for the human tourists.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.500
Never! Never! NEVER!

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.500
NC: Wow. That transition was so lazy and uninspired, you could just replace it with this.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.600
Norm: I'd never do that for the human tourists.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.100
Never! Never! NEVER!

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.800
NC: In fact, for this movie,

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.800
I think there should be a new commandment that just says

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.300
Nothing else, just "NO"!

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.700
Norm!NC: Hey, I have an idea for-

00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:59.300
NC: NO!

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.700
Norm!NC: I thought it'd be funny if maybe I-

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:01.300
NC: NO!!

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:02.900
Norm!NC: But wouldn't it be cool if perhaps I-

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.800
NC: Moses sculpted an entire tablet simply for this commandment.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.900
The answer is NO!

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.400
Norm!NC: Mmmmm....

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.400
But perhaps if I could just-

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.500
NC: God has a sharpshooter pointing at you all the time.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.500
Don't give him a reason.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.700
Something else you'll notice is that the camera is always spinning in this movie.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:23.400
It's like the camera operator is in constant orbit around whatever piece of shit is being photographed.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.500
I feel like I'm on a dizzying ride!

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.700
WhooooOOOOAAaaa!

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:29.880
Norm: The Arctic Shake...

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.200
Tamara: Aw, what? Is spinning too much for you?

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.200
NC: No, I just had to listen to the dialogue.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Male Tourist: That bear's not scary at all!

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.700
He belongs on Broadway!

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.200
NC: (as Norm) Oh, no! That's...

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.700
not what I wanted to be?

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.800
I thought you didn't want to be a scary animal.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.400
You know, see if you can get along and be peaceful with people?

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.400
Norm: These intruders.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.300
They've never done anything for us except to come to our land uninvited.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.100
NC: Motivation, you drunk again?

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.000
Motivation: Only when you are stupid.

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:11.500
In fact, he's so spontaneously hates humans

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:15.000
that he's looking to get rid of a person's house that suddenly pops up.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.800
Norm: There's a human house right here on Grandpa's land.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.800
Forebear: You want to be king?

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.600
A future king isn't supposed to get so emotional.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.500
And for the love of salmon, no more talking human!

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:28.000
NC: Yes, don't use the gift your grandpa said was good to talk to humans

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.400
that you don't want to talk to because you hate them now anyway.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.500
Grandfather: Just know that what you and I have is a great gift.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.100
Motivation: Piss off!

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:41.800
NC: And by the way,

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:45.500
you see how these three lemmings are following Norm around like they're close friends?

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.000
Yeah, this is the first time we're seeing that.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
They go to see the house in the scene prior,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.700
but aside from that, we've never seen them before.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.100
Or...maybe we have,

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.500
it's just one of these tainted tribbles,

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.600
but following him out with their heads hung low because they have such a connection with him?

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.400
This is the first time they're even acknowledging that they're in any way friends!

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.800
NC: I mean, establishing the strong relationship out of nowhere is just lazy!

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:07.600
Isn't it, Bill?

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:13.800
Bill?

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:15.900
Bill?

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.100
Bill!

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.700
(scared) Bill?

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.100
Bill!

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.000
BILL!!

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.400
BIIIIILLL!!!

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.400
BIIIILL!!

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.300
BIIIIIILL!!!

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:36.300
Good grief.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.500
I'm all alone!

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.100
Who'll take care of me?!

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.600
I'll starve to death!

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:43.900
BIIIIILL!!!

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.000
Bill: Mm-hmmm?

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.100
NC: Oh.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:47.900
That's right, Bill.

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.500
You became the temporary king of Iceland.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:50.300
Bill: Mm-hmm.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.300
NC: Well,

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:52.600
it's good to have you back, Bill.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.600
Bill: Mm-hmm.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.700
NC: Do the Bill Dance!

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.700
But, hey, maybe they're learning from their mistakes.

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:05.300
I mean,

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:09.100
they did evolve this character from one word to a 20-second scene.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:10.000
Yeah, I counted.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
20 seconds, folks.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.500
Elizabeth: Don't just dance for the humans.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.400
Fight for our home instead.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.200
Norm: Okay.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.800
I won't let you down.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.700
NC: (as Norm) I will uphold that check that you got for one minute of dialogue.

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.400
It's the least I can do for the least that we gave you!

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:26.700
Norm: We have to do something!

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.000
I have to do something!

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:29.700
Socrates: Ah.

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.900
Number one or number two?

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:37.100
You know, I'm just gonna start a conspiracy site for how this film got made.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.600
Theory one...

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.800
I can't prove that I'm right,

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:53.800
but you can't prove that I'm wrong.

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.700
They see the human house is there for a real estate commercial,

00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.900
which Norm plans to sabotage, because...

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:00.500
again,

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.400
he sees the value in human life.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.700
Nigel: A director always delivers

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.000
and never quits.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.400
Cameraman: There goes the footage...

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.000
NC: We never see that cameraman again,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.400
so I'm just gonna presume he's dead.

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.300
Bringing the kill count to surprisingly two!

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.800
I question your age-appropriate rating, Dove Foundation!

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:20.500
By the way, I didn't Photoshop that.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:22.000
(laughing) That's totally on there!

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:23.600
Vera: Sea lion!

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.200
Hi!

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.000
Please come back.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.200
Norm: It's a seal, you generalist.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.300
Humans think all animals look the same.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:32.200
NC: Yes.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.100
I was shocked by that line, too.

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:37.700
Rob Schneider and racial sensitivity
usually go so hand-in-hand.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.100
An agent for Greene Homes named Vera,

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.100
played by Heather Graham,

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:44.300
talks with her daughter Olympia when she notices Norm in the distance.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.400
Vera: I think he's charging me.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.300
Is that bad?

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:48.300
Olympia: It says, "When confronted with a polar bear..."

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:52.000
NC: And is it me, or is the animation so awkward that when this kid turns sideways,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.100
her eye looks like the Devil's Venus flytrap?

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:56.000
Demonic Voice: *GROWL*

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.900
I WILL SWALLOW YOUR SOUL!

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:00.400
Vera: Let me call you back, honey.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.500
Mommy has an idea.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.100
NC: Vera films Norm chasing her,

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:04.900
and sends it to her boss, Mr. Greene,

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:06.000
played by Ken Jeong,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:06.800
and...

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.500
NC: I'm not gonna lie, this line of reasoning is so strange that,

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:12.700
like violent vomit,

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.500
I have to bring it up in chunks.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.800
Vera: I got some really great footage of a polar bear that almost attacked me.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.700
Greene: I love it, I love it!

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:21.800
This bear is a star.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.700
This will definitely get me approval from the Polar Council.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:25.500
*pop*

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.500
NC: Why would a dangerous animal sell home?

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.200
Surprisingly, nobody wants property with a bear living on it

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.400
unless Nicolas Cage is hiding inside.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.200
And don't tempt him with that offer!

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.200
He needs the money.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:41.200
Greene: We need a real symbol of the Arctic who can convince these morons to buy my homes.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.600
Find an actor who looks just like that bear.

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:44.200
*pop*

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.100
NC: Well, again, problem solved, he needs the money,

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:46.800
but second:

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.200
Why would you need an actor who looks like a bear?

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:53.300
Is that some sort of trick they don't teach you in real estate school?

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.500
(as a buyer) Well, I was gonna turn you down, but...

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:56.900
dude looks like a bear.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.800
You can connect the dots.

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:04.400
Greene: Let's use the Arctic to sell the Arctic.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.100
Booyah!

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:06.200
Vera: *gasp*

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:08.200
*pop*

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:09.600
NC: Why did she gasp?

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:14.100
I mean, yes, any movie that says "booyah" should be given balls so they can be castrated,

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.400
but...shouldn't she be happy?

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:16.600
She fixed her problem.

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.300
Maybe it suddenly hit her that her daughter has devil eye.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.500
*DEMONIC GROWLING*

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:22.700
Seriously, what was that?

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:27.000
Finally, why is Ken Jeong doing his worst Patton Oswalt?

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.600
Greene: Bring the commercial and the model back home to New York and I'll see you tomorrow, mañana.

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.500
Did they approach Patton Oswalt, and the first thing he said was...

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.200
"Do you know who I'm not?!

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:37.400
Ken Jeong!"

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.100
(normal) And then they're like, "Ooh! We should get Ken Jeong!"

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:40.600
"His career is on the rise.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:44.000
Let's see if we can put a stop to that by casting him as someone who's supposed to move funny,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.200
but instead moves like a sped-up inflatable outside of a car rental!"

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:51.300
You know, can this movie be like Split, where it's all secretly connected to another movie?

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:54.800
'Cause I would kill if this was actually the prequel to Alaska!

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.200
If Norm of the North gets the treatment the mother got in that

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.000
this would at least be in the double digits.

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.400
So Norm sneaks on to a submarine that lost its dentures,

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.900
and Vera comes home to her daughter,

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.500
who is presumably Sherman after he got a sex change.

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:07.600
Which, let's be honest,

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.900
we all saw that coming.

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:10.500
Vera: This is only a tour.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.000
We still need Mr. Greene's help and...

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.500
Olympia: Mom, you're putting too much pressure on yourself.

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.200
NC: Okay, I know it's a cartoon, I shouldn't be questioning this, but...

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.300
How is that neck supporting that head?

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.700
It's like a straw trying to balance a potato.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:25.300
I'm just gonna question those logistics throughout the entire film.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Norm comes across two henchmen who try to catch him, but he runs outside, and he...

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:30.900
ACHOO!!

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:31.900
Oh, sorry about that.

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:32.700
*clears throat* Where was I?

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.300
I'm...sorry, I sneezed.

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:44.500
Apparently, that was enough to totally lose track of what was going on!

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.700
Okay, let me rewind this here.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:49.200
Okay, they confuse a guy in a bear suit for him

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.300
and rather than call the cops, he practices ninjutsu on them.

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.200
Okay, now everything makes sense!

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.400
(chuckling) Sorry, that must have seemed really stupid before I explained it.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:02.200
But Greene finds out from that terrifying dream you had about Gilbert Gottfried in drag

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:05.700
that if he doesn't get his approval ratings up, he can't sell houses in the Arctic.

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:10.000
But not before an essential scene of the lemmings pissing in a fish tank.

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:16.900
(whispering) All ages.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.100
Even though it's rated PG.

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:20.300
All ages!

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:25.200
And by the way, they clearly have their time priorities planned out.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.300
We had under a minute showing Norm's connection to his love interest,

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:32.000
literally no time dedicated to showing Norm's connection to his comic relief.

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:33.500
But lemmings pissing?

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.200
And trust me, it gets uncomfortable.

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:56.600
They're all just...

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.600
staring at them.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.100
(whispering) Is this life now?

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.000
Vera: Thank you all for coming.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:44.500
NC: DAAAH!

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:45.300
What's wrong with you?!

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:46.100
The lemmings pissing!

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:47.100
Go back to that!

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:48.800
That needs to BE!!!

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.800
D'oh... All right.

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.900
I suppose people came for something OTHER than rat urine.

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:55.500
Did they?

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.700
Norm is immediately hired as the spokesperson,

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:02.000
though Mr. Greene is surprised that an image as scary as a killer bear

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.800
is as scary as a killer bear.

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.600
Again, how is this campaign supposed to work?

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.800
Vera: ...And even brought Arctic lemmings.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.500
YES!!

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:16.400
They realized the error of their ways and they went right back to the lemmings pissing!

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:17.300
Don't be afraid to stare!

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:18.800
(creepily) The movie says it's okay.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.700
(whispering) This is now our everything.

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:28.200
Greene: Well, he's too authentic.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.100
I mean, we need a bear that is happy.

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.200
That makes people feel warm and safe.

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.200
NC: Like that scary video you sent earlier.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.700
How do you movie, movie?

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.700
But he dances, which wins him over,

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:42.000
but he discovers he really is a bear, which makes him angry again,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.900
so he goes into a restaurant with a gun to try and kill him.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:46.400
Because...yeah.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.400
This will get your approval ratings u-

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.300
*stuttering* What?!

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:52.100
Vera: The local news caught your outburst.

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:53.900
Everyone's talking about Norm,

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:57.400
and look at our approval ratings.

00:17:57.700 --> 00:17:59.800
NC: Okay, I know this is a kid's film.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.400
Presumably one you show when punishing your kids

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.200
but, I'm sorry.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.300
How can any of this result in higher approval ratings?!

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.200
That's like a celebrity being found guilty of a crime

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:09.900
going to jail

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:12.200
and when she's released, somehow she's worth even more money!

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.800
And if you thought that joke was too easy

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.600
Screw you! It's Norm of the North!

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:16.900
They can go for the easy ones!

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:18.000
Why can't I?!

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:19.500
(through his teeth) STUPID!!

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:23.800
(sighing) So, they want to use Norm again, making this pointless detour

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.000
what, 26?

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.300
Though, Norm still tries hold out for more.

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:31.200
Norm: Well, Normie has to look for a new job and a place to live.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.600
Not all of us can afford a fancy Greene condo.

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:36.400
Which I hear is fully furnished and uninhabited.

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.800
NC: This is better than Schneider's usual bargaining line, which is

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.800
(imitates Patton Oswald again) "Do you know who I know?!"

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.300
So they end up also giving him a nice place to live.

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:46.500
And, in this film's natural progression

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.000
we move from pissing lemmings to farting lemmings.

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:51.500
But they are merciful on this one.

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:52.300
Only

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:54.600
are dedicated to this.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.700
*farting*

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:56.300
Norm: Okay.

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:57.300
*fart*
Okay, look...

00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:01.300
*farting again*

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:02.600
NC: I'd like to point out, by the way

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.200
that when I typed "farting lemmings"

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.900
autocorrect asked if I was sure this was my life.

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.900
Sadly, yes.

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:11.400
iPad: *crying*

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.000
Oh, don't cry.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.100
Vera's going to put him on a talk show

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:19.300
but before she does, she introduces him to her daughter, Olympia.

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:20.600
Vera: Yes, hi, Mr. Greene.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:21.600
Sorry I didn't pick up before.

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.700
Norm: Your mom is very good at her job, Olympia.

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:28.000
Olympia: Sometimes I wish she wasn't so good at her job

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
if it meant she got to spend more time with me.

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.800
NC: You know, I make fun of this movie, but in all honesty

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:39.700
it is very impressive to see the first fully
computer-animated motion picture.

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:43.000
Oh, I don't mean animated WITH computers

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.100
I mean animated BY computers!

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:49.000
Because only a machine would combine all of these cliches

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.900
and think it somehow equals cinematic emotion.

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:54.600
NC: And I actually have that computer right here

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.400
the Talent Replacer 9000!

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.000
Say hello, 9000.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.700
TR-9000: Hello, 9000.

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.500
NC: Oh, that sounds like humor!

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.200
It's years old and not very funny!

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.000
But nevertheless, you've picked up on it

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.400
and that's very impressive.

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:07.500
TR-9000: Of course.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:11.300
It is how I make what you humans have called "give-up" films.

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:12.600
NC: Now tell me, 9000.

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:14.500
How did you come up with these ideas?

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.400
TR-9000: I do not come up with anything.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:20.100
I calculate what is used in every movie and put it in my movie.

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:24.200
Where most films choose to focus on one or two of these cliches

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.000
to make an emotional connection

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:26.700
I say

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:27.600
"suck it"

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.200
and replace the emotion with more cliches.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.500
The misunderstood hero.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:32.600
The busy parent.

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:33.900
The budding friendship.

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.300
Dance sequences.

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:36.500
Corporate villains.

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:37.300
Fart jokes.

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:38.300
Pee jokes.

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:39.700
The list is never ending.

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:41.600
NC: And that's what you did with Norm of the North?

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:42.600
TR-9000: No.

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.500
For Rob Schneider movies, I use a different formula.

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:46.000
NC: Oh, yeah?

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:46.900
And what's that?

00:20:47.259 --> 00:20:48.300
TR-9000: Rob Schneider

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:49.300
derp dee derp.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.600
Derp dee derp dee derp dee derp.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.900
Until one day, the derpa derpa derpa derp.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:59.900
Rob Schneider is Da Derp Dee Derp Da Teetley Derp Dee Derp Dee Dumb.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.700
Rated PG-13.

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:03.300
NC: Ah! Dove Foundation approved!

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.100
TR-9000: Oh.

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:05.200
I mean, PG.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:05.800
NC: That's right.

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.000
Parental guidance suggested.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.200
Even though it's been approved for all ages.

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:10.100
TR-9000: Derp.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:15.500
NC: After going on TV where they show the security footage with such incredible angles and editing

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:18.500
you'd swear they were just too lazy to animate another scene.

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.300
Norm, in the middle of the interview

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:21.100
dances.

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.600
Yeah. He wasn't asked.

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:25.600
They weren't talking about it.

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.700
He just kind of randomly starts doing it.

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:31.000
It just comes right the hell out of nowhere, and suddenly,

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.300
we're in a musical.

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:34.200
It's like if in the middle of this review

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.829
I suddenly started dancing!

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:44.600
Mr. Greene takes Norm's voice and makes it sound like he supports putting his houses in the Arctic

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:48.400
so he goes to Vera's because he remembers hearing that Olympia was a genius!

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:50.700
Norm: I actually think Olympia and myself are a lot alike.

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.000
Two peas in a pod.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:53.900
Olympia: Besties.

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:56.900
NC: Yes!

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:58.000
That's exactly right!

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.300
You had one scene!

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:01.600
And now, you're immediately besties!

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:05.100
I think this whole entire film was some idiot looking through the garbage

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:07.800
finding the shredded first drafts of successful films

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.100
taping them back together

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:10.400
typing it up on a computer

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.900
setting the computer on fire

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:13.300
inhaling the fumes

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:14.000
death

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.200
and this was the mocking eulogy some asshole gave at his funeral!

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.000
And THAT

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.900
is the BEST-case scenario!

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:25.100
Olympia says he should go after the investors, and of course

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:27.700
she happens to know exactly where they are

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:31.800
and Norm shows them Greene already signed off on the homes without getting their approval.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.300
Chef Kosawa: How did you get these?

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:37.100
Norm: I had some very small hairy associates relieve Mr. Greene of his flash drive.

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:37.900
*farts*

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:43.900
NC: Every joke that comes from those pubes of misery should be followed by that kid crying from A Christmas Story.

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:44.600
*fart*

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:49.200
Randy: *crying*

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:52.700
NC: But things get crazier when Norm finds out Greene has his grandfather

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:55.000
and apparently has been holding him this whole time.

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.700
Well, what the hell's the point of that?

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:59.300
You could have cut the grandfather out of the second half of this film

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:00.800
and you wouldn't miss a damn thing!

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:01.500
*confused stutter*

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:04.700
Did he have more of a story, and then the director just sent a note saying...

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:07.800
Because if that's the case

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:08.900
how do you explain this?

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.800
A scene where they escape

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:11.900
get captured again

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:13.300
only to escape again!

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:13.800
Yeah!

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.600
The scenes only last a few minutes!

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:19.100
There's even a fake-out to make you think that Norm and his grandfather die

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:21.200
only to find out they're really still alive.

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:24.800
LITERALLY followed later by ANOTHER fake-out

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:27.500
making us think that Norm and his grandfather die

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:30.000
only to find out that they're actually still alive!

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.200
Oh, my God.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.500
This film's on constant repeat.

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.200
It just keeps going over and over and over!

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.400
It's on a continual loop!

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:35.900
It's like

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:36.600
Groundhog Day

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:37.800
except instead of watching Bill Murray

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:38.900
we're watching Rob Schneider!

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:42.700
INSTEAD OF WATCHING BILL MURRAY, WE'RE WATCHING ROB SCHNEIDER!!

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:44.700
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:51.500
So the villain's plan is thwarted

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.500
Vera and Olympia live happily ever as pencil necks with

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:56.000
necks literally pencils

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.700
and the Rob Schneider bear

00:23:58.100 --> 00:23:58.900
*shudder*

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:00.500
...procreates.

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:01.400
And we

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.300
...never think of that concept again.

00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:12.000
(calm) And that was Norm of the North.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.200
A film so bad that it helped me achieve enlightenment.

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:18.500
Malcolm: So it's worse than Garbage Pail Kids?

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:20.000
NC: Well.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.900
No. Nothing's worse than Garbage Pail Kids.

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:23.200
Tamara: It's worse than Mamma Mia?

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.100
NC: Well, okay, nothing's as bad as that either, but-

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:26.100
Malcolm: The Master of Disguise?

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:26.600
NC: No

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:27.100
Tamara: Son of the Mask?

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:28.100
NC: Not re-
Malcolm: Cat in the Hat?

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:28.700
NC: Not exactly-

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:29.400
Tamara: Bio-Dome?

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.400
NC: You're ruining my Zen thing.

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.300
Malcolm: Fant4stic?

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:33.100
NC: (snaps) Okay, it's not as bad as any of those!

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.500
It's just your

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:36.900
...run-of-the-mill bad.

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:39.000
Don't get me wrong.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.500
This is a tough film to get through.

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:41.200
It's stupid

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:41.800
it's lazy

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:42.500
it's annoying

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:43.200
but it's

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.400
...nothing you wouldn't expect.

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:50.800
It doesn't surpass the unlikeability I would imagine I'd get from an animated Rob Schneider flick.

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:54.400
If anything, it gives the exact crap I thought I would get.

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:56.000
So, yeah.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.100
It sucks, but

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:59.700
...I can't say it's the worst thing ever, or

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:02.000
...even in my top 10 of worst things ever.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:02.700
It's just

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:04.200
...bad.

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:07.500
But that means that I didn't achieve enlightenment.

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:09.400
I just watched a really stupid flick.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:10.600
I'm not any smarter

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:11.700
I'm not any dumber.

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.300
Okay, I'm a little dumber.

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:15.900
But, this isn't the worst impact a film has had on me!

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.300
I can't see without seeing!

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.000
I can't bring about peace when there isn't peace!

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.200
Oh, my God, I shaved my head.

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:21.600
I look like a jackass now!

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.300
A complete and total jackass!

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:24.100
And for what?!

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:26.000
Norm of the freaking North?!

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.900
I gave up my hair for THIS?!

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.200
OH, MY GOD!

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.100
What have I done with myself?!!

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:33.700
WHAT HAVE I DONE?!?!?!?

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:36.300
Malcolm: Wait.

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:38.500
You still think you had hair?

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:45.340
*crash*
NC: *BATTLE CRY*

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:40.200
TR-9000: Derp

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:47.600
Hello, Doug walker here.

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.100
Wasn't messing around, I really did it.

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:50.300
*laugh*

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:51.100
And, uh

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:55.200
We are doing the charity shout out here as usual and this week, we are doing

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.200
Project Hope.

00:26:57.100 --> 00:27:00.400
Project Hope delivers essential medicine and supplies

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.800
volunteers and medical training to prevent disease

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:04.000
promote wellness

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.300
respond to disaster

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:07.500
and save lives around the globe.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.200
Project Hope has been a leader in providing community education

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:16.000
and healthcare worker training to help halt the global epidemic of diseases

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.360
such as diabetes

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.200
obesity

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.000
and cardiovascular disease.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.400
They also utilize health affairs

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:28.000
which is the leading journal of health policy thought and research exploring health policy issues

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.100
of current concerns and domestic and international spheres.

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:35.800
They've also gained a reputation of financial integrity and efficiency

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:42.600
with more than 90 percent of their expanded resources supporting their life-saving health projects around the world.

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.200
If you look at their site and their YouTube page

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:51.400
you can see the hard-working volunteers and various places and people they help on a daily basis.

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:54.700
