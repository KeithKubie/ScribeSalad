00:00:00.603 --> 00:00:03.270
Let's think about what
happens to an IS curve

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.104
when government spending goes up.

00:00:08.104 --> 00:00:13.183
To think about that, let's
first draw our Keynesian cross.

00:00:13.183 --> 00:00:16.210
On the vertical axis over here,

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.014
we have aggregate expenditures.

00:00:19.014 --> 00:00:20.836
In the horizontal axis right over here,

00:00:20.836 --> 00:00:22.381
wee have aggregate income.

00:00:22.381 --> 00:00:23.625
These are really just 2 ways

00:00:23.625 --> 00:00:25.718
of talking about GDP.

00:00:25.718 --> 00:00:27.789
We are thinking, we actually
want all of the points

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:29.386
where the economies and equilibrium

00:00:29.386 --> 00:00:31.599
where income is equal to expenditures.

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.848
That's why we draw that line of slope 1,

00:00:33.848 --> 00:00:35.066
that's all of the points

00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:36.978
where income is equal expenditures.

00:00:36.978 --> 00:00:39.982
Where is economy is in
some type of equilibrium

00:00:39.982 --> 00:00:41.483
or in equilibrium.

00:00:41.483 --> 00:00:43.394
Then we think about planned expenditures.

00:00:43.394 --> 00:00:47.648
Planned expenditures, we've
done this multiple times,

00:00:47.648 --> 00:00:51.118
it's equal to aggregate consumer spending

00:00:51.118 --> 00:00:55.318
which is a function of income minus taxes.

00:00:55.318 --> 00:00:57.451
Or it's a function of disposable income.

00:00:57.451 --> 00:00:59.394
We're not seeing C x Y - T,

00:00:59.394 --> 00:01:02.230
we're seeing C is a function of Y - T.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.313
This is one way of talking
about consumption function.

00:01:04.313 --> 00:01:06.811
We assume it's linear in
this video and another

00:01:06.811 --> 00:01:07.918
but it's doesn't have to be,

00:01:07.918 --> 00:01:09.316
it could be a curve of some kind.

00:01:09.316 --> 00:01:12.253
Then we have our planned investment,

00:01:12.253 --> 00:01:14.479
plus planned investment

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.445
which we're assuming that
we're sitting at some,

00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:21.515
that our real interest
rates are fixed right now.

00:01:21.515 --> 00:01:26.315
Planned investment plus
government spending

00:01:26.315 --> 00:01:29.315
and then we could even
throw net exports out there

00:01:29.315 --> 00:01:31.935
if we assume that we have
some type of an open economy.

00:01:31.935 --> 00:01:34.105
This curve, our plan investment,

00:01:34.105 --> 00:01:36.602
this is all a review of
the Keynesian cross videos,

00:01:36.602 --> 00:01:40.666
it might look something like this

00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:46.514
and we get to our
equilibrium level of GDP.

00:01:46.514 --> 00:01:48.782
We can also use this information

00:01:48.782 --> 00:01:51.321
given that we were sitting
here at interest rate r1

00:01:51.321 --> 00:01:56.451
to start, to at least plot
one point on our IS curve.

00:01:56.451 --> 00:01:59.185
Let's draw at least point on our IS curve

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:02.119
and hopefully you feel good
about the general shape of it

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.450
and then we could think about
how the IS curve might shift.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.387
Here, we have real interest rates.

00:02:07.387 --> 00:02:09.014
We're trying to relate real interest rates

00:02:09.014 --> 00:02:11.266
to aggregate GDP.

00:02:11.266 --> 00:02:13.847
We just showed that
when real interest rates

00:02:13.847 --> 00:02:14.844
are sitting at r1,

00:02:14.844 --> 00:02:19.592
if this is r1 right over here.

00:02:19.592 --> 00:02:21.323
If real interest rates are sitting at r1,

00:02:21.323 --> 00:02:24.097
we know that the aggregate
level of output or income

00:02:24.097 --> 00:02:25.852
is that point right over there.

00:02:25.852 --> 00:02:27.379
We could just drop that down

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.781
and so it is this level right over here.

00:02:30.781 --> 00:02:34.094
When real interest rates
are r1 this is our output.

00:02:34.094 --> 00:02:37.182
That is a point on our IS curve.

00:02:37.182 --> 00:02:39.782
We can draw the entire IS curve

00:02:39.782 --> 00:02:46.051
which might look something like that,

00:02:46.051 --> 00:02:47.513
that is our entire IS curve.

00:02:47.513 --> 00:02:49.045
If we kept changing this,

00:02:49.045 --> 00:02:52.113
if we kept trying this out for
different real interest rates

00:02:52.113 --> 00:02:53.426
we could plot more and more

00:02:53.426 --> 00:02:56.181
of these points along the IS curve.

00:02:56.181 --> 00:02:58.848
This is really thinking in terms of,

00:02:58.848 --> 00:03:01.320
if real interest rates go up

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.594
then this whole expression will go down

00:03:03.594 --> 00:03:05.432
then this thing will be shifted down

00:03:05.432 --> 00:03:08.098
and so we would have less GDP.

00:03:08.098 --> 00:03:10.096
If this gets shifted down

00:03:10.096 --> 00:03:12.312
your equilibrium GDP might go over here.

00:03:12.312 --> 00:03:14.051
At a higher real interest rate

00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:17.116
you would have lower aggregate income.

00:03:17.116 --> 00:03:19.433
That's how we actually thought
about plotting our IS curve.

00:03:19.433 --> 00:03:22.260
Now, with all of that out of the way,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.853
let's think about what happens

00:03:23.853 --> 00:03:25.782
when government spending goes up.

00:03:25.782 --> 00:03:28.683
Well, if government spending goes up,

00:03:28.683 --> 00:03:30.804
if this piece right over here goes up,

00:03:30.804 --> 00:03:35.517
that will shift our planned
expenditures up as well.

00:03:35.517 --> 00:03:39.150
So your change in government
spending, change in G,

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.319
it would shift this curve up.

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.731
Let me draw that a little bit neater.

00:03:43.731 --> 00:03:45.652
It would shift this curve up

00:03:45.652 --> 00:03:49.486
and you would get to a new level of income

00:03:49.486 --> 00:03:52.070
or equilibrium level of real GDP.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.181
That amount, this delta Y

00:03:55.181 --> 00:03:56.852
which is this amount right over here.

00:03:56.852 --> 00:03:58.649
It's actually going to be
equal to the multiplier

00:03:58.649 --> 00:04:01.521
which is 1 minus the marginal
propensity to consume

00:04:01.521 --> 00:04:05.985
times our change in government spending.

00:04:05.985 --> 00:04:07.177
You don't have to worry
about this too much

00:04:07.177 --> 00:04:08.653
for the sake of this video,

00:04:08.653 --> 00:04:10.563
that's just a little bit of a review.

00:04:10.563 --> 00:04:12.583
The whole reason why I'm
going this is we're saying,

00:04:12.583 --> 00:04:14.855
"Look, assuming r1 didn't change

00:04:14.855 --> 00:04:18.766
"and when we increased government spending

00:04:18.766 --> 00:04:21.410
"it shifted GDP up by that amount."

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:22.724
When you increase government spending,

00:04:22.724 --> 00:04:27.908
it shifted at r1, it
shifted it by that amount.

00:04:27.908 --> 00:04:30.532
Well, that would be true at
any of the real interest rates

00:04:30.532 --> 00:04:32.061
along the IS curve.

00:04:32.061 --> 00:04:34.419
In general, if you increase
government spending

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.460
and you're not changing
any of this other stuff

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.753
then the IS curve would
shift to the right.

00:04:39.753 --> 00:04:41.261
If you decreased government spending

00:04:41.261 --> 00:04:43.594
the IS curve would shift to the left.

00:04:43.594 --> 00:04:45.460
With that in our toolkit now,

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.530
we can think about

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.419
how a change in government spending

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.417
might change our equilibrium
point in our IS-LM model.

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:54.126
Let's do that.

00:04:54.126 --> 00:04:56.994
Once again, real interest rates.

00:04:56.994 --> 00:05:02.667
Here we have aggregate income or real GDP

00:05:02.667 --> 00:05:05.200
and then we have our IS curve.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.417
Our IS curve looks something like that.

00:05:08.417 --> 00:05:12.501
Our LM curve, I will do it in magenta.

00:05:12.501 --> 00:05:16.864
Our LM curve might look
something like that.

00:05:16.864 --> 00:05:19.664
So, if we have a increase
in government spending,

00:05:19.664 --> 00:05:24.083
we already saw the IS
curve shift to the right.

00:05:24.083 --> 00:05:25.414
I want to do that in the same color.

00:05:25.414 --> 00:05:26.468
It shift to the right

00:05:26.468 --> 00:05:29.003
and it might look something like that.

00:05:29.003 --> 00:05:33.458
If our old equilibrium real
interest rate was sitting here

00:05:33.458 --> 00:05:35.664
and equilibrium income was sitting here,

00:05:35.664 --> 00:05:38.129
we saw that by increasing
the government spending

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:42.133
our new equilibrium GDP is higher

00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:45.597
and our new equilibrium
interest rate is higher

00:05:45.597 --> 00:05:47.927
just by the shift to the IS curve.

00:05:47.927 --> 00:05:49.004
Now, you might be saying,

00:05:49.004 --> 00:05:50.727
"Okay Sally, you've been
focusing on the IS curve

00:05:50.727 --> 00:05:52.799
"but does an increase
in government spending,

00:05:52.799 --> 00:05:55.126
"does it affect the LM curve?

00:05:55.126 --> 00:05:56.724
"A change in physical policy,

00:05:56.724 --> 00:05:58.419
"does that affect the LM curve?"

00:05:58.419 --> 00:05:59.746
We're not talking about
printing more money,

00:05:59.746 --> 00:06:01.794
we're talking about the
government spending more,

00:06:01.794 --> 00:06:03.498
increasing its budget.

00:06:03.498 --> 00:06:04.665
Remember, the LM curve,

00:06:04.665 --> 00:06:08.057
it's driven by people's
liquidity preferences.

00:06:08.057 --> 00:06:09.929
At different levels of GDP,

00:06:09.929 --> 00:06:11.669
how much do they want to hold money

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:13.666
and how much would you
have to pay for them

00:06:13.666 --> 00:06:15.927
in terms of interest for
them to depart with it?

00:06:15.927 --> 00:06:17.661
How much interest are they willing to pay

00:06:17.661 --> 00:06:19.666
to get access to money at
different levels of GDP?

00:06:19.666 --> 00:06:21.831
That's not really impacted
by government spending,

00:06:21.831 --> 00:06:24.999
and it's also impacted
by the money supply,

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:26.669
by the amount of money that are out there

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:28.927
and just general levels of prices.

00:06:28.927 --> 00:06:30.395
You could start to think about,

00:06:30.395 --> 00:06:31.466
"Oh, doesn't government spending

00:06:31.466 --> 00:06:32.756
"affect the prices in the long run?"

00:06:32.756 --> 00:06:34.725
But if we just hold a lot
of those things constant

00:06:34.725 --> 00:06:35.927
especially in the short-term,

00:06:35.927 --> 00:06:38.127
especially if you hold prices constant,

00:06:38.127 --> 00:06:41.196
fiscal policy is not going
to change the LM curve.

00:06:41.196 --> 00:06:44.261
Monetary policy, the money
supply part, that could

00:06:44.261 --> 00:06:46.597
or people's liquidity preferences could.

00:06:46.597 --> 00:06:48.393
But just government policy by itself,

00:06:48.393 --> 00:06:51.003
fiscal policy by itself won't change it.

00:06:51.003 --> 00:06:55.468
In this model, just not trying
to get too over-complicated.

00:06:55.468 --> 00:06:59.528
When government spending
goes up, when G goes up,

00:06:59.528 --> 00:07:01.329
it would shift the IS curve to the right.

00:07:01.329 --> 00:07:03.084
Increase in real interest rates,

00:07:03.084 --> 00:07:07.084
increase in real GDP
according to this model.
