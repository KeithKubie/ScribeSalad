00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:10.700
&gt;&gt; POON: My name is Alex Poon from Bonfire
Media. Bonfire has been building mobile application

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.769
for about six or seven years now. And the
application actually we're showing today at

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:23.699
Google I/O is called Pocket Auctions for eBay.
And as the name suggests, it's an eBay application

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:31.449
for your mobile phone. It's essentially a
miniaturized version of eBay. It's got the

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:39.940
most basic features like My eBay, search,
completed search, bidding, buy it now, even

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:48.059
gallery pictures. But our Android version
is the newest version of our Pocket Auctions

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.049
for eBay application and it is by far the
best one that we've built so far.

00:00:54.049 --> 00:01:03.339
&gt;&gt; That's great. So, you chose to develop
this on Android. Can you tell us a little

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:05.810
bit about the technical reasoning behind that?
&gt;&gt; POON: The reason we chose Android as one

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:14.010
of our platforms for Pocket Auctions for eBay
is that we were able to add some really unique

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:22.110
features to our application that really only
the Android operating system allows. So, along

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.920
side all the standard features like search
and bidding and so forth, really one of my

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.160
favorite features is what we call the 10-minute
Warning. So, the idea here is that you're

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:40.070
bidding on a set of items, you may even have
items in your watch lists, and 10 minutes

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.570
before any of those items ends, your phone
will buzz you in your pocket or in your purse

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.090
and that will give you a chance, basically
a reminder to say, "Hey, you may want to go

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.880
bid on this item now." And it's for anyone
who uses eBay. They'll realize why that's

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.590
a pretty big competitive advantage. And the
aspect of the Android that's really important

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.870
there is the ability for us to run in the
background. We've also added some features

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.450
like barcode scanning. So the idea here is
that you're out in about maybe in a traditional

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.569
store and you see something that's on sale,
and what you can do is you whip out your Android

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:21.879
phone, scan the bar code and it will actually
look up the price of that item on eBay and

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:28.170
you can figure out whether or not should you
wait to buy it on eBay or buy it now. And

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:37.689
then we just launched also with the new Cupcake
release the ability to show eBay daily deals

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:44.060
right on the phone top, on the home screen.
So the idea here is eBay every day themselves

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.950
publishes four daily deals--and they're actually
pretty good deals--and so what we've done

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:56.590
is we just captured that feed and we rotate
among those deals right on the Android homepage

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:08.819
or home screen.
&gt;&gt; So, are there any other features in Cupcake

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.969
that you've been able--that you've taken advantage
of?

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:12.579
&gt;&gt; POON: Other features in Cupcake that we're
going to take advantage of are--one is Live

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:18.790
Folders. So, right now, the way our application
works is that, let's say you're an avid eBay

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.560
user and you want to check you're my eBay.
Well, you launch the application, you log

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.060
in, and you'll see all the items you're watching
the bidding on. Well, why not have a live

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.939
folder right on the home screen where you
click on it and without ever having to launch

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:42.019
the application you immediately are shown
the latest or the items that you're watching.

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:50.109
&gt;&gt; So, you talked a little bit about some
features that are available on the Android

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:54.739
for you that aren't available on any other
platforms. Are there any others?

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:00.400
&gt;&gt; POON: Features in our Android application
not available on other platforms, yeah, there

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:07.980
is actually one other feature that is actually
pretty important to point out. Anybody who

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:14.489
uses eBay realizes that sometimes it's not
in your best interest to bid early on an item.

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:21.070
And what people will do on ebay.com is they
will constantly refresh their browser page

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.030
so that they can get their bid in the last
minute. Right? And so what our Android version

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:32.940
can do is it actually counts down the time
left on an auction in real time. So, on any

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:38.600
ordinary item page, you can actually see counting
down in real time the time left so you can

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.650
get your bid in exactly the right time that
you want to.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.670
&gt;&gt; So, you've been working with the Android
platform. Is there anything in the development

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:52.960
process that has made it particularly easy
for you?

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:59.590
&gt;&gt; POON: One thing I really like about the
Android development process--and keep in mind

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.210
that we've been developing apps on mobile
developments for about six or seven years

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:12.620
now--is the fidelity between the emulator
that ships with the STK in the actual devices.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.440
Anyone in the mobile business for more than
three or four years knows that just because

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.090
you get it to work in an emulator, it doesn't
mean it's going to work on the device. But

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:30.500
actually with Android, that's not true. I'm
not sure I have seen many bugs at all that

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:36.760
come up only on the device and not the emulator.
&gt;&gt; That's great. So, do you have any advice

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.930
for other developers who want to get started
developing on the Android platform?

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.080
&gt;&gt; POON: The only advice I'd give folks who
are interested in developing on the Android

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.710
is that just dive right into it. You know,
it's really about--don't read manual. I mean,

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.150
actually, I don't know that Google gives you
a manual. It really is about downloading the

00:05:54.150 --> 00:06:00.490
examples source code. And it's actually using
the samples as the base of your application

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:06.500
and just extending those samples to what you're
building, and then everything just comes from

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.510
there. As long as you know Java, you're right
on track at learning Android.

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.930
&gt;&gt; Excellent. Well, thank you Alex for coming,
and enjoy the rest of the show.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:14.940
&gt;&gt; POON: Thank you.
