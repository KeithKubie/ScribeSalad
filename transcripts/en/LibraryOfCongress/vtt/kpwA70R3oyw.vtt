&gt;&gt; Marisa Bellack:
Hi there everyone.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.110
Look comfy on those
bean bag chairs.

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.140
Hello, I'm Marisa
Bellack, I'm an editor

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.880
at the Washington Post,

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.290
a charter sponsor of
the book festival.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.050
And I'm pleased to
introduce Meg Medina.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.300
Author of books for children,
pre-teens and young adults

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.400
that feature strong
Latina characters grappling

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.270
with questions of culture
and identity and facing some

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.320
of the central challenges
of our time.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.820
Meg touches on family separation
in her book Tia Isa Wants a Car

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.150
which received the 2012 Ezra
Jack Keats New Writer Award.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.080
She deals with migration in
her young adult novel The Girl

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.960
Who Could Silence the Wind.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.390
She writes about bullying

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.950
in Yaqui Delgado Wants
to Kick Your Ass.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.140
Which was banned from
some school libraries and

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.500
yet won the American Library
Associations top honor

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.160
for Latino Children
and Young Authors.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.680
Although she was named
Margret Rose after the sister

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.510
of Queen Elizabeth, Meg is the
daughter of Cuban immigrants.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.700
She was born in Virginia
and raised in Queens.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.910
She's a founding member
of We Need Diverse Books.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.280
And regularly notes the
depressing statistics that less

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.860
than 3% of children's books
are by or about Latinos.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.140
I imagine she may speak
about that some here today.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.310
Her newest book is Merci
Suarez Changes Gears.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.780
It's a story she says
about how to say goodbye

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.180
to the important things in life.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.440
The book actually isn't
out until September 11th

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.250
but I understand there are
copies available at the festival

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.660
and Meg is scheduled
for a signing session

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.410
from five to six this evening.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.840
Before we dive into our
discussion I'm suppose

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.140
to mention that the Library

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.590
of Congress has been
the festivals host

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.740
since the festival
began 18 years ago.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.470
I want to thank festival
co-chairman David Rubenstein

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.530
and the many sponsors who
made this event possible.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.390
You can support the
festival with a donation,

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.400
there's information
in your program.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.720
Please note too that there
will be time for questions

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.550
after Meg's remarks and anyone

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.180
who asks a question
will be filmed

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.880
for the library's archives.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.510
Now please help me
welcome Meg Medina.

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:16.350
[ Applause ]

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.380
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Thank
you so much.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.990
Buenas tardes, good afternoon
everybody, thanks for coming

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.130
out tonight and this afternoon

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.780
and you're right you can't
see anybody from up here.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.800
So you're all invisible except

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.260
for these really comfortable
kids on the bean bag chairs

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.480
and next year can you please
ask them to put a bean bag chair

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.110
up here for me because that
would be kind of fun to be able

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.670
to talk with you from there.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.600
So I am here, this
is me and my Bitmoji.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.100
I discovered bitmojis
like a year ago

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.180
and now I'm unstoppable, I
have a bitmoji for everything.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.180
And this is Meg bitmoji who's
going to be our concierge today.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.010
And I'm here to talk about
Merci Suarez Changes Gears

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.990
and you notice that it's a girl
on a bike and we do change gears

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.600
on a bike and it
becomes harder to pedal.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.520
But we change gears over
the course of our life

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.260
and that's sort of
the idea of that book.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.020
That book did not start as a
novel, it started like this.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.950
I was asked to write a
story for an anthology,

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.160
which is a collection of
stories called Flying Lessons

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.600
and Other Stories.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.810
And it had some really
great authors,

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.250
some of my favorites were
in there like Jackie Woodson

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:37.060
and Kwamer Alexander and Matt
de la Pena and others and so

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.430
when they asked me to
write a story they said,

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.110
Meg we want a story
the only thing you have

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.140
to do is make sure that the
character is Latina like you.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.840
You can tell us any story
that you want to tell us.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.450
And I said I can?

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.830
And all of us did, here's
some of us at ALA one year.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.820
So I was thinking about it and
I thought back, I had a memory

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.270
of a time when I was
playing with my best friend.

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.580
When I was in elementary
school and my best friend

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.580
in elementary school
I think you know her.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.240
Her name is Raquel,
but you know her

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.220
as RJ Palacio who wrote Wonder.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.770
And so we lived like a block
and a half away from each other

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:25.740
and Raquel is from Colombia
and my family was from Cuba.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.300
And so our mothers could
talk to each other in Espanol

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.260
and we were good friends and
one day Raquel and I were

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.100
in the back of her house
and the ambulance came.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.840
And the police came and all
these adults were standing

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.640
around and not letting us look

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.530
and we were like,
what happened right?

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.750
And so sadly what had happened
is that there was a gentleman

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.360
who lived in her building by
himself, an older gentleman

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.270
and he had passed away, he
had died and no one knew.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.260
And so we as little kids were
like oh my gosh we've been

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.730
in this building with
a dead body for days

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.810
and we were all freaked
out about this.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:18.920
But over time, over the years
I've thought about that man

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:24.290
and his living alone and
the way that he passed away

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.660
and it was just a story that
just always stuck with me.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.140
So when I was writing
Soul Painting, the story,

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.870
I started with a dead body.

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.580
That's found in the
condominium in Florida

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.120
where Merci Suarez lives.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.810
And that morning her father, who
owns Soul Painting Inc arrives

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.370
to pick her up, her
and her brother Roli.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:54.980
And they're going to spend
the day painting the gym

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:00.480
at their new school in
exchange for tuition reduction.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.720
And of course her father
notices this is apartment

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.130
with a person who died etcetera.

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.250
And the story's really
about what it's

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:13.590
like to be the scholarship kid
in a school where everybody sort

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.390
of has more money than you.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:19.750
And it's a story about what that
looks like, what that feels like

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.680
and what it's like for a kid

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.970
to see their family
making sacrifices for them.

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:31.840
Okay it was a great
story, I loved it,

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.530
the book did really well, I
even did the recording of it

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:39.040
in my own voice which was
really fun and a little scary.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.950
But when I was finished I
thought I was not really

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.980
finished because here's
what happens to writers.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:51.290
The character gets in your
brain, it's like a worm.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.610
And then I'd be walking
around going,

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.710
I wonder who else Merci
lived with in Florida.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:04.480
I wonder how it really went for
her at Seaward Pines Academy.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.700
I wonder who the pain in
the neck is in her class.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.930
I wonder does she have
primos and tias and tios,

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:15.210
like what's the whole shebang.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:20.490
And so my editor Kate who's
this woman in the picture,

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:22.780
we were together one day
and I was explaining to her

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.620
that I couldn't get Merci
and Roli and Poppi and Momi

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.110
out of my head and
she said that's

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:31.610
because you're not
finished with the story.

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.050
You have to keep writing.

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:37.400
So I did and I decided
okay I'm going

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.230
to turn this story into a novel.

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:45.570
And that's the story that is
now Merci Suarez Changes Gears.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:50.000
Here's the thing, that's what
it looked like as a story

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.870
and this is the cover now.

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:57.240
But here's the thing, turning
a story into a novel is

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:02.000
like turning a fish
into a mango.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:10.450
So the fish and the mango are
both colorful, they're the same.

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:12.980
The fish and the mango
you could say are kind

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.180
of tropical, that's the same.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:19.910
If you want to be really scary
you could say you could eat both

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:24.770
of those things, yes that's true
but they're nothing the same.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:28.180
And that's the thing
about writing a novel.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:32.150
That a story is just like a tiny
little piece of someone's life

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:35.320
but a novel is the whole thing.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:39.190
So I had to rethink
this whole story.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:41.800
And I decided that I was
going to think about family

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.900
because that's what I
normally write about.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:48.400
So I don't know what your
family is like, but I'm going

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.830
to tell you about my familia.

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:54.960
When I think family,
it was not me

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.450
and mommy and my sister Lydia.

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:02.370
When I say family I
mean it in a big way.

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:05.180
With my aunts and my
uncles and my grandmother,

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:08.150
I'm the kid in the yellow dress.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:12.910
And the ladies is my aunt,
my mother, my grandmother

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:15.820
and my other aunt, [foreign
word] and [foreign word].

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:19.060
And over here looking
very miserable on the day

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:26.190
of my holy communion is
me with [foreign word]

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:30.240
and [foreign word], [foreign
word] is this one on this side.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.090
She was very interesting she
use to watch lucha libre,

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:37.590
which is mass Mexican
wrestling on TV.

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:41.260
And she would always be
my after school babysitter

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.710
and tell me crazy
kinds of scary stories

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:48.950
like when the hurricane wiped
out her village etcetera.

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:52.520
And [foreign word]
was my fathers mother

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:56.850
and she was the scary abuela,
do you have scary abuelas,

00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:00.040
grandma sometimes, very strict?

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:04.080
Who makes you eat radishes
and your salad and they insist

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.380
that you wash your hands and you
have to be a little more formal

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:09.990
than you normally are, that
was abuela [foreign word]

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:15.010
and she was also a seamstress,

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:17.450
that's a person who
sews clothes.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:20.330
She worked in Manhattan
and every year

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:23.280
on my birthday abuela
[foreign word] would show

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:30.140
up with bags filled with my
entire wardrobe for the year.

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.030
Which was great because
my mother worked

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:35.410
in a factory she could not
afford to buy me clothes

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:37.520
and [foreign word] made them all

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.220
without asking me once
what color I liked,

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:43.420
whether I wanted shorts,
a dress, nada right?

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:46.900
They came and you see this
picture of me in the bed,

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.830
I have 12 of them, one
for every year of my life,

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:52.950
right I'm sitting, it
was a staged photograph

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:56.840
and I was suppose to look
very grateful for the clothes,

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.030
I hope I look grateful there.

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:03.990
So I was thinking about my
abuelas, like family right?

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:07.090
And then I was thinking
about how this would look

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:09.300
in Merci's life and
then I thought

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:15.090
about how my mother always
wanted us to live all together.

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:17.110
It was her dream.

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:21.140
She had a cousin in Miami who
lived in three houses just

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.630
like this, these flat top houses

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:26.820
that the family had
connected one to the other

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:32.460
with little hallways and covered
roof ways, Julia lived in one,

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:36.910
Julie lived in the second
one and then Julieta,

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:39.200
the youngest one
lived in the third.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:43.520
So three generations of a
family all in one compound.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:47.910
I thought [foreign word],
right who would want to live

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:51.980
with relatives because they
all tell you what you do.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:56.240
When to wash your hands,
what show you can watch,

00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:00.420
you have to babysit a little
cousin, you know how it is.

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:01.840
So I thought this was crazy

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.570
but my mother thought
this was heaven.

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:09.180
So when I was writing Merci
Suarez Changes Gears I said you

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:11.920
know what she's going to live in
Florida and she's going to live

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:16.780
in three houses with
a big Badinski family.

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:20.410
And so I gave her abuela and
abuelo, the grandparents,

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:23.990
I gave her tia Inez with these
two psycho five year old twins

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:26.820
that are always getting
in trouble.

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:31.650
But then I said okay I also
need to give her a school life.

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:34.680
And someone at school
who really annoys her,

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:39.010
so I gave her Edna Santos.

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:46.530
Edna Santos who always says no
offense but, like no offense

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:49.370
but you don't spell well.

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:51.990
No offense but I
don't like your shirt.

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:57.460
No offense but your
eyeglasses are funny etcetera.

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.980
We all know an Edna Santos.

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:02.500
So I gave her Edna Santos.

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:05.930
But I had to give
her a bigger problem

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:08.080
and when I'm writing
books for kids I

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:11.130
like to tell them the truth
so I was thinking about some

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:15.490
of the problems that my
own family faced now.

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:17.430
And here was some of them.

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:20.290
The first I was remembering
abuelas sewing room

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:23.900
and that thing that use to scare
me when I slept over at night

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:26.030
because it has no head and legs.

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:29.780
And at night it cast big
shadows like a ghost.

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:33.070
But then I was thinking
of current life

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:37.140
and here's my husbands mother,
my kids call her Ola who was

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:40.360
in her 90's and had
come to live with us.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:44.550
At the same time that my
mother who was very sick

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:48.830
and in her 80's had come
to live with us too.

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:53.260
At the same time that
tia Esa who was also

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.710
in her late 70's had
come to live with us,

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:58.720
are you counting
that's three old people

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.620
who came to live with us.

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:04.140
Okay. And they came to
live with us at a time

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:10.290
when I had teenage kids who did
band and brought friends over

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:12.310
and were starting to date.

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:17.500
And so [foreign word], abuela
and Esa and Ola were part

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:21.320
of our life but they also did
things that drove my kids crazy

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:25.820
like say things like this,
do you have a girlfriend?

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.260
Right? Oh boy.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:33.250
And one time my son came
upstairs, that's him and Ola

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:36.070
and he looks so upset
I said [foreign word]

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:39.670
and he says Ola came out
to say goodnight to me.

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:43.900
I said so what and he goes
she was not wearing pants.

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:47.830
Very upsetting.

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:49.420
And so what ended
up happening is

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.670
that my kids stopped
bringing home, you see my son

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:54.950
and his friends there.

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:58.360
My kids stopped bringing
home friends and they started

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.510
to leave the table quick.

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:03.670
And I felt sad about
that and I knew

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:06.940
that they missed the
grandmothers that they remember

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:09.310
that brought them
Pokemon and Bay Blades

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:12.040
and a million stuffed animals.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.250
And we were all trying to live
together and love each other

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:19.330
and understand all the
ways we were changing.

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:25.070
The way teenagers were changing,
the way we change in our 80's.

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:30.890
So I wrote that story because
eventually my kids did get

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:32.730
to the other side.

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:36.420
We did figure out how to
make that family work.

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:39.370
And so it was crazy and
people were butting in

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:43.000
and asking crazy questions
but there was a lot of love

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.050
in that family and that's
what I wanted to write

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:48.720
for Merci Suarez Changes Gears.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:52.150
So it's a story that's funny,
that has annoying people,

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:56.960
that even has an
unfortunate eyebrow incident.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:03.620
But it also has loss and the
way that we have to say goodbye

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:07.700
to the people who
matter the most to us.

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:11.550
This cover I just want to give
a shout out to Joseph Cepeda,

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:14.910
do you know the book
Esperanza Rising?

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:18.980
So Joe was the artist of that
book cover and I'm so honored

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.790
that he is the artist
of this one.

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:24.980
And the last thing I want
to say, because I know a lot

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:30.460
of you have iPhones is that
Merci Suarez has, her dream is

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:33.420
to get this bike right
and the first chapter

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:35.180
of the book and throughout.

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:37.340
I'm giving away a bike.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:42.320
So if you go to this website you
can enter, it's a small essay

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:45.230
of why you want to win a bike
or you just post a picture

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:48.170
of yourself on this bike
and on September 11th

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:51.700
which is the official pub date,
we're going to pull a name

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:54.440
and if you are willing to
drive to Richmond Virginia

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:58.530
where I live, a mere hour
and 45 minutes to the south.

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:01.100
You could win a beautiful
mountain bike,

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.550
so check it out on that website.

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:07.240
And I think we have like five
minutes or so for questions,

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.410
so if you want to ask
me anything about Merci,

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:11.440
about writing, about
my crazy family,

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.160
now's the time, [foreign word].

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.670
Yes oh please come
to the microphones

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:19.720
if you have a question.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:24.110
Nada, I have stunned you?

00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:28.970
Okay then I am going
to, last call,

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:31.620
oop here comes someone,
thank you.

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:34.130
&gt;&gt; Oh I just love to talk
to you, I just didn't want

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:38.800
to hog it up so, I have a girl
scout troop and it's a mixture

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:43.510
of girls whose heritage
is Bolivian.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:50.330
We have one girl who is from,
her parents are from Vietnam

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:54.030
and we have another family
they're from Afghanistan.

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:56.630
And I'm just sitting here
listening to you talk

00:17:56.630 --> 00:18:00.180
about your culture
and how it blossoms

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:03.120
and thinking that's the
kind of things that I love

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:06.410
when they start talking and
comparing, usually in sort

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:08.180
of negative terms but.

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:09.480
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yeah.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:12.350
You know how it is in their
homes and everything like that.

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:14.820
You know I think what's
really interesting to me is

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:18.770
that when you talk to kids from,
whose families comes from all

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:22.530
over the world, you find
a lot of similarities,

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:25.410
especially around
extended families.

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:28.050
Like this notion that your
grandparents live separate

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:30.990
from your parents, live separate
from cousins and things.

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:35.630
It's very unique to us here
but really typically we live

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:38.840
in extended families and
also like the hard things

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:42.520
of like explaining this
culture to people who are

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:45.200
of another culture like if
your grandparents see things

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:48.180
from a different perspective,
like that's really challenging.

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:51.560
But I do love to, I
just love to see that.

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:54.920
&gt;&gt; I just love the way you told
that story and I'm going to try

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.420
to tell that story to my girls.

00:18:56.420 --> 00:19:00.330
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Well get the
recording, that could be easier.

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:02.060
Hello on this side.

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:03.720
&gt;&gt; Hello.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.020
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yes.

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:06.320
&gt;&gt; Where you ever bullied cause

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.690
of the clothes you
wear from your tia or?

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:12.050
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Say that again.

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:16.490
&gt;&gt; Where you ever, oh,
where you ever bullied cause

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:17.920
of your clothes?

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:19.980
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Was I ever
bullied because of my clothes?

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:21.280
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:22.580
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: No cause my
grandmother was a really

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:23.880
good seamstress.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.310
So I had some rocking clothes.

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:30.600
But I, she did a good
job but they weren't,

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:35.620
you know I would've
picked jeans, torn jeans

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:37.100
and sneakers and
things like that.

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:39.110
She had other ideas for me.

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:40.410
Yes?

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:47.350
&gt;&gt; Why did you think
it was a bad idea

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:52.810
for all your family
to live in one house?

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:54.650
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Because
in real life,

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:59.860
because I knew how my family was
and everybody had an opinion.

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:03.500
And everybody had,
everybody could raise me.

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:07.380
So it wasn't my parents, my
mother wasn't the only one

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:10.760
who could tell me to go to bed
or not eat this or do that,

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:14.560
everybody, so it was going
to be like having six

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.850
or seven moms and dads on me.

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:20.580
And that felt hard for me.

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:24.290
But in the end when I had
everybody living with us

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:26.860
when I was the mom
and I had kids,

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:32.940
I found that although it
was hard, it taught all

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:39.530
of us this way of being
generous to each other

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:42.730
and patient with each other.

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:46.340
There were some really
sad days together

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:51.170
and then there were also some
really happy days together.

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:55.650
And I wouldn't trade it, I
wouldn't do it differently.

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:57.720
Hi there.

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:01.670
&gt;&gt; When did you start
writing books?

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:04.070
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Well
unofficially in the third grade

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:07.100
when Mrs. Zuckerman said
that I was good at it

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:09.620
and I was really thrilled.

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:14.500
But I waited a long time,
I wrote all kinds of stuff

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:16.440
like advertisements and I wrote

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.840
in little newspapers
and things like that.

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:25.350
But the year I turned 40 I
decided it was now or never

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:29.530
and I quit my job and I
decided I was going to go home

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:36.280
and write a novel and
luckily for me it worked out.

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:39.010
Oh sorry.

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:41.650
&gt;&gt; Why did you want
to start writing?

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:43.680
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: You
know my family,

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.260
I come from a family
of story tellers.

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:49.110
They, everything about them

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:50.800
when they were putting
away the groceries,

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.700
when we were driving somewhere,
when we were just sitting there

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:57.170
like pulling the rocks out of
the bowl of beans or whatever,

00:21:57.170 --> 00:22:00.190
it always a story like,
huh I remember the time

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:03.340
that little boy got chased
in my village by the pig.

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:06.550
Oh I remember the time this
man ran away with so and so,

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:09.390
on and on, it was story
and story and story.

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:11.710
And my grandmother
was the best one

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:16.330
because she really
knew how to do drama.

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:19.290
Like she'd get to the part
that you were like on the edge

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:21.970
of your seat and
she'd say and you want

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:25.810
to know what happened next
and you'd be like, yes.

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:30.660
So she was wonderful
and so I learned early

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:35.150
on that stories knit
us together.

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:38.560
I learned early on that
stories sort of give you a sense

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.560
of like what happened
before you.

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:46.700
Right? And I learned
imagination through stories,

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:48.230
like just sitting
there listening

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:51.980
to it I could imagine Cuba,
I could imagine chickens,

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:56.050
I could imagine these big
juicy mango's, like all of it

00:22:56.050 --> 00:23:01.400
and then it just
became part of how I am.

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.200
Hi.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:29.040
[ Foreign Language ]

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:31.200
&gt;&gt; And my question was
I would like to know

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:37.170
if you are interested about
writing a book of children

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:41.710
or teenagers without relatives
or family here that come

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:44.940
from different countries and
how could be the life of them?

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:46.240
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yeah.

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.050
Well I'm going to say this,
I think that there are

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:54.250
so many tragic stories
right now that we can tell

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:56.090
through the Latino lens.

00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:59.260
Including children who
are here without parents,

00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:02.240
who've been separated from
parents and in some way I did

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.510
that with the Tia Isa
Wants a Car if you know

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:06.280
that picture book of mine.

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:10.140
Her parents are elsewhere
and she's her with the Isa.

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:15.800
So would I be interested,
yes, but it's always the story

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:19.280
of the girl more than the issue.

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:22.560
I have to find the
connection to the young woman.

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:25.940
So I never say never,
it's possible.

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:29.520
And I think we have only
one more question I'm

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.580
down to two minutes.

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:32.880
Yes.

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:35.520
&gt;&gt; Okay so my question
is about Burn Baby Burn.

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:36.820
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yes!

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:40.620
&gt;&gt; So what motivated you to
write about the son of Sam?

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:43.570
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Oh because
I was 14 the year that son

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:46.350
of Sam was murdering
girls in my neighborhood.

00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:48.880
And that is a terrifying
experience.

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:53.080
And because I was wondering what
it's like for teenagers now,

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:58.280
who sort of have that
slow burn of fear in terms

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.210
of shooters and things
like that.

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:03.280
And I wanted to just take
a look at that history.

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:05.200
And right now my
timer is holding

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:07.610
up a very sweet sign
that says wrap it up.

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:11.100
So I'm going to wrap it up
and I'm so glad that you came,

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:12.680
I thought I wasn't going
to have anybody and it's

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:14.560
so nice to see your faces.

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.760
Gracias. Thanks, bye.
