TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:03.730
for "The Developer Show."

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:05.855
This is your weekly update
on the coolest developer

00:00:05.855 --> 00:00:07.270
news from Google.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.300
Wide color photography
is coming to Android,

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.010
so it's time to get
your applications

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.612
wide-color-gamut-ready.

00:00:13.612 --> 00:00:15.070
This article can
help you with that

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.440
by showing you how to
test your application,

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.010
and giving you the steps you
need to take to be ready.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.930
The link is in the
description below.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.680
You can now access Google
Groups audit logs right

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.870
from within Cloud audit logs.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.730
This opt-in feature
can help you use

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.330
Google Groups to manage your
organization's data access.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.400
Links to get started
are on the post.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.390
Google Kubernetes Engine is
a managed Kubernetes service

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.470
that puts security, reliability,
and ease of use first.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.920
Check out this post for all the
updates on what's new with GKE,

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.380
including release
channels, Windows Server

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.580
containers in rapid channel,
and Stackdriver Kubernetes

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.570
Engine monitoring.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.790
Google and Binomial
have partnered

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.640
to open source the
Basis Universal Texture

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.730
Codec to improve the performance
of transmitting images

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.760
on the web and within desktop
and mobile applications

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.480
while maintaining
GPU efficiency.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.190
Now the basis universal texture
format is similar in size

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.550
to JPEG on storage, but
six to eight times smaller

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.860
than JPEG on GPU.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.203
More info and a link to
the GitHub are on the post.

00:01:21.203 --> 00:01:23.120

I'm Timothy Jordan for
"The Developer Show."

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.746
Thanks for watching, and
we'll see you next week.

00:01:26.746 --> 00:01:29.830
By the way, did you know there's
a smudge in your teleprompter?

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:30.730
It's fine.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.790
I just want you to know.
