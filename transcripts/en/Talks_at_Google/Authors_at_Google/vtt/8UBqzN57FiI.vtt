00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.920
&gt;&gt;Announcer: And welcome you back to our Authors@Google
series.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.400
It's a really exciting topic for me.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.060
A couple of years ago I, I was reading a lot
of books on the topic of resilience and you

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:25.460
know fine meditation and, and different things
and one of my friends which I met in, in Bali,

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.630
in Indonesia, recommended, you know, Kamal.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:37.360
So I, I read the book, I found it very tactical
and interesting and things that I could apply

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:44.239
real quick to my busy life at Google, [chuckles]
in my personal life too.

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.790
So, you know, we actually kind of it kind
of just happened that Kamal was in the U.S.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.720
in New York and, and, and so was I, so we,
we are really happy to actually bring this

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.720
to you.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.979
And I encourage you guys to ask questions,
tactical things that you could do on a daily

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:05.890
basis when you're working and or stressed
out.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.850
I know I found it very interesting when I
read the book.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.130
So with that, Kamal.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.229
&gt;&gt;Kamal Sarma: Great.

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:13.229
[applause]

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.880
&gt;&gt;Kamal Sarma: Oh, I get a clap.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.880
Hello.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.880
Excuse me.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.880
Hello.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.880
&gt;&gt;audience: Hello.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.940
&gt;&gt;Kamal Sarma: Hi, how you guys doing?

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.570
My name is Kamal Sarma.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.391
I'm really honored and excited to be presenting
to you today on a very topical issue, which

00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:32.391
is resilience.

00:01:32.391 --> 00:01:36.579
And I want to just take you through some ideas
and concepts.

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:40.450
So let's, let me start off with first, let's
see if this works.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.299
Can you see this in the back row?

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:45.299
No?

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.299
Alright, cool.

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.620
Oh I see it twice, ok.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:54.090
Let me give you some stats from the working
population.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.509
Now obviously this doesn't apply to you or
any of your teams.

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.100
But this applies to friends of yours who work
in other organizations here.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.649
So here's the stats: Between, whoops, let
me just go back one step.

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:07.990
Fifty-six percent of us don't get enough sleep.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.500
Yes, and the person who's yawning in the back,
yes that relates to you.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.930
Sixty-two percent of us don't get enough exercise.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.799
Fifty-three percent of us would tick a box
to say we're overwhelmed.

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.580
But wait, there's more.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.580
One in, so one in five, about eleven to twenty
percent of people in the working population

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.960
would tick a box to say that they're depressed.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.760
Don't you love coming to work?

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.760
What about this?

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.400
Twenty-nine percent of us are obese.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.680
That's not overweight.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.900
That is obese, right?

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.300
And twenty-two percent of us are exhausted.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.300
Wow.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.760
Don't you love delivering on those projects?

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.760
Yeah?

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.270
Unfortunately this is the challenge that we
face.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:53.730
So I want to really kind of get you to evaluate
and explore some things.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.470
Here's the guidelines for today's presentation.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.409
Number one is please don't believe a word
I say.

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:01.709
I'd be really, really disappointed if you
believe a word I said.

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.939
However, what I'd like you to do is try it
on.

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:08.400
And what I mean by that is focus on what if
this was true?

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.510
You with me?

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.040
So when you, ma'am, what's your name?

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.040
&gt;&gt;female #1: Polivy

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.040
&gt;&gt;Kamal Sarma: Polivy.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.150
Now when you go shopping, say you're going
to buy a pair of shoes, what do you do?

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.620
Do you go and buy the first pair of shoes
that you get or do you try them on?

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.720
[whispering]: Please say try them on.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.829
[laughing] You try them on, right.

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.140
So what I'd like you to do is try on this
concept.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.080
If you think it's a load of hogwash, leave
it in the room.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.670
If you think it's worthwhile, walk away with
it.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.079
Is that ok with everybody, yes or no?

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:37.079
Yep?

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.079
Cool.

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:40.209
So do not believe a word I say, ok but just
try it on.

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.090
Number two is emotionally engage.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.250
So we run a leadership firm.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.990
And they say that management is about logic.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.290
Leadership is about emotion.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.519
I will repeat that.

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.040
Management is about logic.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.510
Leadership is about emotion.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.299
The reason why we follow certain leaders is
they create an emotional connection with us.

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:03.650
True or false?

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:04.650
Yep.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.329
It's not just about the head, it's about the
heart.

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:10.180
And finally, [laughing] the last one, is stay
present.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.189
Do you know what I mean by that?

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:14.159
Who's ever had this experience?

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:17.859
You've been speaking to your partner and suddenly
they realize that you've not been there?

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:18.859
C'mon.

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:19.859
Yep.

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:20.859
Or you've been speaking to your kids.

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:21.859
Who's ever done this?

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:23.960
Who's ever been in a meeting and you've been
in la la land.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.670
Do you know what I mean by la la land?

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:26.670
You've checked out.

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:27.730
You've been thinking about your holidays.

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.990
You've been thinking about everything that
you're gonna do and somebody asks you, "Hey,

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.920
say Kamal, what do you think about that?"

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:33.920
And you go, "Oh, crap."

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.920
You with me?

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.070
So the most, by far, the most challenging
thing is to stay present.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.150
To stay present to all the stuff that's happening
around to us.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.190
Most people have checked out.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.560
You know what I mean by this?

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.080
Who's ever had a conversation in a party or
something and somebody's checked out and you

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.080
know it?

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.080
Yeah?

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.080
How good does that feel?

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.390
It feels like crap, doesn't it?

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:54.390
Yep.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.290
And we know this, but by far one of the most
challenging things to do is to stay present

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:59.670
in the room.

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.240
And that's what you're here to do.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:08.440
I am 100 percent sure that you are not designed
to listen to a short brown guy talk about

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.440
leadership.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.440
True or false?

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.260
[chuckles] You're designed to be answering
e-mails, be doing work, all that kind of stuff,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.260
right?

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.260
So this is weird.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.260
I get that.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.260
But let's make sure we stay present.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.690
Now the way I'm gonna do that is that I'm
pretty, not very good as a speaker, but I'm

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.330
ok as a conversationalist.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.350
What does a conversation require.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:29.350
guys?

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:30.880
Two people having a conversation.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:31.990
So let's have a conversation.

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.100
Is that ok?

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.610
Yes or no.

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:35.610
Fantastic, great.

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.120
Let's move on.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.120
Ok.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.730
We do a lot of research, so we work in about
39 countries and you know with executives

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:43.620
like yourself, asking them, "What's on your
mind?"

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.100
"What are the things that really, you know
what are top, top issues in your mind?"

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.500
And this is what the research shows.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.600
A lot of people struggle with time.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.910
Who resonates with that?

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:54.910
Yep.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.840
Just resonating, just getting the time to
do the stuff to focus on yourself and other

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:59.840
people.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.170
And number two, managing expectations.

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.590
Do you notice when the more you do the more
you get?

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:07.590
Did you notice that?

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:08.590
Yep.

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:09.590
Yep.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.580
The more competent you are, [chuckles] the
more competent you are, the more work you

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.580
get.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:13.580
Yep.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.300
And lastly, the stress.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.530
So I want to talk about all these three things
because those seem to be the, the kind of

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:25.390
the really driving forces of the level of
fulfillment that you have in your life.

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:26.660
So.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.370
This presentation is fundamentally about you.

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.310
Here is my definition of success.

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:38.430
My definition of success is that you hear
one thing or one idea or one concept that

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.780
you want to share with somebody that you love.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:41.810
Yep.

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:46.380
Who's been to a training program or a speech
and they've waxed lyrical about something,

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.390
but it hasn't had any personal resonance?

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:49.390
Yeah?

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:50.800
So I call this the 'me level'.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.620
Because if we've got that, then we've got
something to play with.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:59.030
If we don't, by the time you walk out this
door you would have forgotten everything that

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:00.030
I've said.

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:03.380
So that is my, my standard I'm gonna hold
myself to.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:04.380
Right?

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.110
That you find one thing that you want to share
with somebody that you love.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.740
I call this the 'me level'.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.100
Then there is the 'we level'.

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.890
So it's got to work at the 'me level', it's
also got to work at the 'we level'.

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:17.910
Who's the first 'we' in your life?

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:21.150
It is your families, right?

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.440
Does the stress that you have, does that impact
on your families?

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.440
Yes or no?

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.440
And your loved ones.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.440
Of course it does.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.690
And they pay a huge price for your success
sometimes, yeah?

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:34.870
So it's gotta have a rate of return at the
'we level', which is your families and your

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:35.870
partner.

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:36.870
Yeah.

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:38.140
The second 'we' is your team.

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.140
Yeah?

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:43.500
It's gotta have a return investment on the
we level which is your team.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:47.690
And finally it's got to have a rate of return
for the shareholders.

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:51.820
I talk about the me, the we, and the it.

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.740
Those three things need to be congruent if
you're gonna flow through life.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:00.070
If those things are incongruent, then you
are going to struggle and you're gonna have

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:01.520
more and more stress.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:05.210
What's gonna happen is you're gonna be very
successful at work, i.e. the it, but that's

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:08.470
gonna affect you at a personal level and your
relationships.

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:10.240
Who's seen that in other organizations?

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.310
Obviously not your organization, but in other
organizations.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:13.310
Yes or no?

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.310
Yep.

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:15.310
And that's not good.

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:16.310
It's not sustainable.

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:18.780
So when is resilience required?

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:21.710
So fundamentally in life this is what happens.

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.120
You go through one stage in your life, yeah?

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.080
And you wanna get to the next stage of your
life.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:30.670
And to a certain degree that is why you're
here today.

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:31.670
Yeah?

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:36.450
That you wanna find something to get to the
next stage of your life or the next stage

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:40.779
of your team development or your business
or your relationship.

00:08:40.779 --> 00:08:45.350
Can I ask you, do most people want to be at
that next s curve, yes or no?

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:46.350
They do.

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:49.399
Do most people want to have a great relationship,
yes or no?

00:08:49.399 --> 00:08:51.829
Do most people want to work on a great team,
yes or no?

00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:55.870
Do most people want to take their business
to the next level, yes or no?

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:56.870
They do.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.279
But do they?

00:08:58.279 --> 00:09:01.180
Look at the stats around divorces and break
ups.

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.480
Look at the stats around health.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.040
So why is it the case?

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:11.910
Why is it the case that most people want this
but they don't have it?

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:15.000
This would be the interactive part of the
session, guys.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.290
[laughing] Any thoughts?

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:19.290
&gt;&gt;female #2: Time and effort.

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:21.129
&gt;&gt;Kamal Sarma: Time and effort, yeah, most
definitely.

00:09:21.129 --> 00:09:24.360
That, that bottom s curve is really busy.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.889
Most people are really busy leading mediocre
lives.

00:09:26.889 --> 00:09:31.410
They're too busy to have a great relationship
to having a mediocre relationship.

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:35.399
They're too busy to have a great sense of
well being, aren't they?

00:09:35.399 --> 00:09:36.399
What else?

00:09:36.399 --> 00:09:37.399
&gt;&gt;female #3: [inaudible]

00:09:37.399 --> 00:09:38.399
&gt;&gt;Kamal Sarma: Sorry.

00:09:38.399 --> 00:09:39.569
&gt;&gt;female #3: [inaudible]

00:09:39.569 --> 00:09:41.639
&gt;&gt;Kamal Sarma: No energy, yeah.

00:09:41.639 --> 00:09:42.879
They are depleted.

00:09:42.879 --> 00:09:44.129
They are exhausted.

00:09:44.129 --> 00:09:45.129
Yep.

00:09:45.129 --> 00:09:46.129
They're just struggling.

00:09:46.129 --> 00:09:48.040
So most people are too busy existing.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.050
You know what I mean by that?

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:50.050
Yep.

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:51.050
To feel alive.

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:54.889
Now I actually sat down and I just waited
in the lobby and just looked at people.

00:09:54.889 --> 00:09:55.959
And I love doing this.

00:09:55.959 --> 00:10:01.129
Go into any large organization, sit in the
lobby and see if you see people walking and

00:10:01.129 --> 00:10:05.920
feeling alive or just, or even grabbing a
cup of coffee, right?

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.560
So what I want you to think about is this.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:14.470
Is that to get from one s curve to the next
s curve is that you have to not learn, but

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:16.370
you have to unlearn.

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:20.389
What you need to be able to do is you need
to be able to disconnect from the past.

00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:22.010
I'll repeat that.

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:24.949
What you need to be able to do is disconnect
from the past.

00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:29.110
What made you successful is not going to make
you successful.

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:31.209
Do you, do you get what I mean?

00:10:31.209 --> 00:10:32.699
So who's in a relationship here?

00:10:32.699 --> 00:10:33.699
Yep.

00:10:33.699 --> 00:10:34.699
Fantastic.

00:10:34.699 --> 00:10:35.699
Yep.

00:10:35.699 --> 00:10:36.699
Remember the first time you started to go
out?

00:10:36.699 --> 00:10:37.699
It was like awesome.

00:10:37.699 --> 00:10:40.470
And ripping off each other's clothes was just
like a connection was there?

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:44.850
Does that, does that stuff happen still ten
years into the relationship?

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:45.870
No, it doesn't.

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:49.459
It's like, you know, you know when you first
called you know each other when you're dating,

00:10:49.459 --> 00:10:51.470
you say, "Hi honey, you hang up the phone."

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:52.860
"No, no, no honey, you hang up the phone."

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.569
Now you say, "Why are you calling me at work?"

00:10:55.569 --> 00:10:56.569
[laughter]

00:10:56.569 --> 00:10:57.569
&gt;&gt;Kamal Sarma: [laughing] It's like that,
right?

00:10:57.569 --> 00:11:01.390
And what we do is we get addicted to our own
successes.

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:02.420
Yep.

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.360
And so let me ask you another question.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.639
The way you treated your body when you were
20.

00:11:06.639 --> 00:11:07.639
Yep.

00:11:07.639 --> 00:11:11.540
Remember you drank a certain way, you ate
a certain way, you partied a certain way.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:16.820
Can you, and you still managed to look pretty
buff, pretty, you know, pretty cut, ripped.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:21.650
Can you still treat your body when you're
30 like that and expect the same results,

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:22.650
yes or no?

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:24.130
No, but do some people try?

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:25.279
Oh yes they do.

00:11:25.279 --> 00:11:28.930
The same, too, with teams and same, too, with
your organization.

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:32.319
What worked at Google when you were one year
old is not gonna work when you're ten years

00:11:32.319 --> 00:11:33.550
old.

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:34.730
And that is the challenge.

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:38.790
The challenge is to unlearn and most people
struggle to do that.

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:42.300
They think what made them successful is gonna
make them successful.

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:46.720
What brings down a great organization is not
incompetent people.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:52.500
Because incompetent people never get to a
place of power to influence the organization.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:57.579
What brings down a great relationship is not
two people that are not in love.

00:11:57.579 --> 00:12:03.060
What brings down a great organization is people
that haven't learned, haven't learned to unlearn.

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:07.709
Or a great relationship is not destroyed by
people who weren't in love.

00:12:07.709 --> 00:12:10.779
It's the two people that didn't grow and learn
and unlearn.

00:12:10.779 --> 00:12:11.779
You with, you with me on this?

00:12:11.779 --> 00:12:14.879
And that's kind of one of the main things.

00:12:14.879 --> 00:12:18.380
I'm not here to teach you how to learn anything.

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:23.290
What I want you to explore is what you need
to unlearn, because that is gonna determine

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:27.290
whether you're going to go from one s curve
to the next s curve.

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:31.899
So, let's talk about this thing called leadership,
because, and unlearning, because you've all

00:12:31.899 --> 00:12:33.699
done it to a certain degree.

00:12:33.699 --> 00:12:39.290
So this is a really key skill you need to
pick up is learning how to unlearn.

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:42.360
So most people start their careers as a technical
expert.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.360
Yeah?

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.470
So the reason why you're in this room is somebody
thought you were pretty smart in the interviewing

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:49.290
process, true or false?

00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:50.290
Yep.

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:51.290
Yep.

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:54.029
And then somebody promoted you to a management
role, potentially, yep?

00:12:54.029 --> 00:12:56.339
And then you're getting a leadership role.

00:12:56.339 --> 00:13:00.660
That's pretty much the kind of trajectory
that most people will follow.

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:04.980
Unfortunately the skills that made you, a
lot of people don't unlearn and relearn, so

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:06.999
being a technical expert is about what?

00:13:06.999 --> 00:13:10.490
It's about proficiency and accuracy.

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:13.270
You gotta do your job proficiently and accurately.

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:16.430
Then what management is about is about effectiveness.

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:20.550
It's about controlling or directing resources,
true or false?

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:21.550
Yeah.

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:23.050
Then it changes doesn't it?

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:27.930
What leadership is about, it's about influencing.

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:31.610
It's about breaking old paradigms and creating
new ones.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:37.580
And unfortunately a lot of people are in leadership
roles, but they don't have the ability to

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:38.580
influence.

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:39.580
Yep.

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:43.009
So what happens is the locus of control fundamentally
shifts.

00:13:43.009 --> 00:13:45.470
So what's the technical expertise about?

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:49.879
Technical expertise is about is you prove
yourself to be the technical expert.

00:13:49.879 --> 00:13:54.559
So you're pretty good at what you did and
you proved yourself to be the technical expert.

00:13:54.559 --> 00:13:57.100
Then you earned the right to manage.

00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:01.300
You're good at what you do, so you earned
the right to manage.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.110
But now who's in control?

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:07.029
So you're in control for technical expertise
and management.

00:14:07.029 --> 00:14:11.790
But when you get to leadership the locus of
control shifts, doesn't it?

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:15.620
The locus of control shifts to everybody else.

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:18.079
It's no longer up to you, is it?

00:14:18.079 --> 00:14:22.139
Because with leadership people choose to follow
you.

00:14:22.139 --> 00:14:24.839
Can I get a quick show of hands who has seen
this?

00:14:24.839 --> 00:14:29.170
Who has seen people who are in the management
role, but when they get stressed out they

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:31.350
drop down to being the technical expert?

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:32.730
C'mon, who's seen this?

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:35.389
At the flippin' wrong time, true or false?

00:14:35.389 --> 00:14:36.389
Yep.

00:14:36.389 --> 00:14:37.529
Or who's seen this?

00:14:37.529 --> 00:14:42.230
People who are in a leadership role when they
get stressed out they start micromanaging.

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:43.730
Who's seen that?

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:45.050
Yep.

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:47.680
At the flippin' wrong time.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.710
And it creates a leadership void.

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:54.110
My belief is that bad things happen in a leadership
void.

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:55.610
You know what I mean by that?

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:56.610
No?

00:14:56.610 --> 00:15:00.610
Be it in your relationship, be it in your
business, be it in your families.

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:02.130
Leadership voids are really bad.

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:08.629
For some of you the biggest leadership role
will be in your families.

00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:09.629
Yep.

00:15:09.629 --> 00:15:12.089
So can I get a show of hands, who's got kids
here?

00:15:12.089 --> 00:15:13.740
Yep, Fantastic.

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:14.740
Great.

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:15.879
Who's been a kid?

00:15:15.879 --> 00:15:17.559
Yeah, there's somebody.

00:15:17.559 --> 00:15:19.800
Who's still a kid?

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:20.920
Julio, please?

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.259
[laughing] So here's the deal.

00:15:22.259 --> 00:15:27.240
So initially your parents were the technical
experts, right?

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:31.730
They clothed you, they fed you, they made
sure that you stayed alive, true or false?

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:32.730
True.

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:33.730
Then they managed you.

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:36.589
They took you to baseball, they take you,
they took you to soccer.

00:15:36.589 --> 00:15:41.610
They gave you, you know, kind of guidelines
to live by.

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:46.720
Then in some families parents step up as the
leaders.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.600
In some families they don't.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:50.949
You with me?

00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:55.670
So the question is, this question.

00:15:55.670 --> 00:16:00.429
Because my belief is this is the beginning
and the end of your leadership journey.

00:16:00.429 --> 00:16:03.040
Why should people choose to be led by me?

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.319
I'll repeat that.

00:16:04.319 --> 00:16:07.040
Why should people choose to be led by me?

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.149
In your personal space, in your professional
space.

00:16:10.149 --> 00:16:13.410
But at Google you guys are in the leadership
position.

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:17.329
You will have a disproportionate impact in
the world that we live in.

00:16:17.329 --> 00:16:19.329
You have a leadership position.

00:16:19.329 --> 00:16:24.679
Will you, will you take that leadership position
and will people choose to be led by you?

00:16:24.679 --> 00:16:27.300
That is the question, I think, that you need
to answer yourself.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.639
So that's the, that's what we wanna play with.

00:16:29.639 --> 00:16:31.290
Is that ok with everybody?

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:32.290
Yep?

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:33.290
Alright.

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:34.290
Cool.

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:40.110
So, what I'd like you to do is by the end
of my presentation I'd like you to be really

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:41.110
confused.

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:43.629
How am I doing so far?

00:16:43.629 --> 00:16:47.870
[laughing] Do most, do most people like to
be confused, yes or no?

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:48.870
Do?

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:49.870
Yes or no?

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:50.910
No, they don't.

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:55.990
And that's why they live mediocre lives with
mediocre relationships with mediocre health.

00:16:55.990 --> 00:17:00.329
Because most people start on this one s curve
and they get really, really excited, yeah,

00:17:00.329 --> 00:17:01.329
I want to do it.

00:17:01.329 --> 00:17:05.530
Then they're at the top of that s curve about
to make the next jump and they get really

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:06.530
confused.

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:12.390
What leaders are about is making sure that
you feel comfortable with confusion.

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:18.610
I hope by the end of this presentation you
are confused as all heck.

00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:19.650
You with me?

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:22.459
Because then I know that you're actually starting
to explore and learn.

00:17:22.459 --> 00:17:24.040
I don't have the answers.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.040
You do.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.410
I have some great questions.

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:32.450
And if you can play with those questions and
stay in that confusion, I know that some kind

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:34.060
of clarity will arise.

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:37.310
And that's why I think mental resilience is
so important.

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:42.180
What leaders are about are making sure that
they have the mental resilience to stay with

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:43.180
their confusion.

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:44.180
Yep?

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:48.630
So, I want to tell you a story, so I'm gonna
switch this presentation button off.

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:50.330
Is that right?

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:51.330
Again?

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:52.330
Ok.

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:53.330
So let me tell you a story.

00:17:53.330 --> 00:18:00.750
I'm gonna tell you a story about an anecdote
about a psychiatrist.

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:05.310
So, there's the head of the psychiatric body
and he wanted to understand why is it that

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:10.040
psychiatrists, who know so much about the
brain and the mind, have such crappy lives.

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.060
Did you?

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:12.080
I'm sorry.

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:16.990
I don't know if you know this, but psychiatrists
have one of the highest rates of divorce.

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:17.990
Yep.

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:19.800
They have one of the highest rates of substance
abuse.

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.950
They have one of the highest rates of suicide.

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:27.400
Now these are the people that we go to for
help [laughing] when we're not feeling too

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.400
good.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.600
There's something a little bit wrong with
that.

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.050
Anyway, so this is the story.

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:35.964
And so there's this psychiatrist, head of
the psychiatric body and he wanted to understand

00:18:35.964 --> 00:18:37.210
why is this the case.

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:41.730
And what he discovered is that monks and nuns
seem to have pretty good lives.

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:46.210
They have one of the highest rates of kindness,
they have one of the highest rates of compassion,

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:52.360
and joy, all the good stuff, the stuff that
makes life worth living, true or false?

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:53.360
True.

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:56.670
So he does all this research and he finds
this monk, finds this Zen monk in Japan and

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:59.210
he flies all the way to Japan.

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:03.760
And the paparazzi are there taking his photograph,
it's huge news all over the world, you know.

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:10.420
You know huge paradigm shift in psychiatry
as we know it.

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:19.000
The psychiatrist walks in and monk is giving
a talk and the psychiatrist sits down.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.700
The first hour goes.

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:24.440
The monk totally ignores the psychiatrist.

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.760
The second hour goes.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.970
The monk totally ignores the psychiatrist.

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:34.660
The psychiatrist is getting severely ticked
off right about now, right?

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:36.090
The third hour goes.

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:40.290
The monk, the psychiatrist really ticked off.

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:42.080
He just cannot deal with it any longer.

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:47.120
So he says in his loudest voice, "Excuse me,
don't you know who I am?

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:51.610
I'm the head of the psychiatric association
globally and I'm here to understand why is

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:59.430
it that you monks and nuns are so happy all
the time and we psychiatrists are so unhappy."

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:08.180
Monk doesn't say a word, quietly walks over
to where the psychiatrist is sitting and gets

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:09.180
a jug of water.

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:15.930
And in front of the in front of the psychiatrist
is a glass.

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:20.820
And what he does is he starts to pour, starts
to pour, starts to pour, starts to pour, keeps

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:25.390
on pouring, keeps on pouring until the cup
overflows.

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:28.160
And the psychiatrist goes, "Whoa, whoa, what
are you doing?

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:33.200
It's too full, nothing's gonna go in."

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:37.160
And the monk speaks for the first time and
he says, "You're right.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:41.270
No matter how good my stuff is, you are too
full.

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:42.270
Nothing's gonna go in."

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:43.270
You with me?

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:44.270
Yep.

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:48.310
So here's what I've found in life and I've
spoken to some of you before this.

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:52.460
And this is I think some of the things that
are happening in your lives, is that things

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:54.380
happen in our life that empty us out.

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:55.380
You with me?

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:56.380
Yep.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.620
You know that relationship that you think's
going really well?

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:00.360
Guess what?

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.320
Not going that well.

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:05.380
Or you know that career that you think is
going really gangbusters?

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:06.980
Guess what?

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:08.440
You get fired.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:12.040
Or you know that routine health checkup that
you go for?

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.040
Yep.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.190
Guess what?

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:15.870
Ain't that routine.

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:17.670
You with me?

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:23.050
My belief is what happens next is what leadership
is about.

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:28.070
My belief is that bad stuff happens to good
people, true or false?

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:32.200
Bad stuff happens to good relationships, true
or false?

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:36.310
Bad stuff happens to good organizations, true
or false?

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:41.180
You can't, the only thing I can guarantee
you is that bad stuff will happen.

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:46.620
I'm sorry, but that's the only thing that
I can guarantee you.

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:50.320
What your responsibility is determining what
you do next.

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:51.320
Yep.

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:54.960
So most people will feel this emptiness and
they'll fill it up with food.

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.530
You know what I mean by that?

00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:57.910
It's comfort eating.

00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:01.300
They get all those emotions and they bury
it deep down inside them.

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:02.300
Yep.

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:03.900
Or they'll choose alcohol.

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:05.360
Or they'll choose work.

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:11.390
Workaholic, chocoholic, alcoholic, I don't
care, but it doesn't serve you and it doesn't

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:12.500
serve others.

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:13.500
Yep.

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:19.730
And that is the challenge, is what do you
do, what do you do when you feel this emptiness?

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:22.220
You will feel this emptiness at some stage
in your life.

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:23.370
I promise you that.

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:26.160
You don't get through life without feeling
that emptiness.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:31.820
But do you have the skills and tools to fill
yourself up with things that will serve you

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:33.250
and serve others?

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:38.940
Because my belief is that is why people will
choose to be led by you as an organization,

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:41.400
in your relationship or as an individual.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.510
Yeah?

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:46.520
So, very quickly about my story and I'll be
very, very quick.

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:47.870
I was born in India.

00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:52.240
I came to Australia when I was about four
years old.

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.400
I was pretty dorky.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.540
[chuckles] Do you use that word, dorky?

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:56.540
Yeah.

00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:57.540
I was quite academic.

00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:58.540
I didn't have any friends.

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:01.691
I didn't play any sports until I discovered
a game called rugby union.

00:23:01.691 --> 00:23:06.710
I know you don't play it that much here, but
it's like American football without the pads.

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:08.410
[laughing] Just kidding.

00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:14.570
And so I became really good at reunion and
I got so good I got to play the rep team.

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:18.320
In Australia, it's a really fun thing, you
get good at sports you suddenly become really

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:19.320
popular.

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.490
[laughs] It's a very cool thing.

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:26.860
So my parents saw me going from this dorky,
Asian, academic kid [chuckles] into this rugby

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.820
hungry, girl hungry fiend.

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:36.650
So you know I was, so what my parents did,
like all good parents do, they sent me to

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:38.450
a monastery in India.

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:45.400
[chuckles] So at the age of 13 I was sent
to an ashram really and I was kind of monk/monastery/ashram

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.980
and I was there for 6 years.

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:55.560
I was very lucky, I learned meditation, yoga,
not in the ashram but with my yoga master,

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:57.070
that's pretty cool.

00:23:57.070 --> 00:24:00.100
In town anything was cool at the time.

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:03.120
Came back to Australia, did an honours degree
in economics, an MBA, joined a company called

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:08.390
McKinsey &amp; Company, I know there are actually
McKinseyites at Google.

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:12.490
Then I went into funds management and then
I started my own VC fund.

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:17.100
So I'm the only monk that I know that's become
a venture capitalist that's very, not very

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:19.610
many people in the alumni group.

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:23.590
And so life was going pretty good, right?

00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:25.140
[laughs] Life was pretty hunky dory.

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:28.100
You know I had married my university sweetheart.

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:29.390
Life couldn't get any better.

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:34.610
We were expecting our first child and I'm
really cocky, you use that term?

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:36.870
I loved the idea of being a dad.

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:41.240
I wanted to be you know I loved the idea of
having kids and stuff like that.

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:46.320
So and my wife was about to give birth, I
was really excited.

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.750
And she was you know put into hospital for
some bed rest.

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:53.780
Anyway, I get a call that night and they said,
"Mr. Sarma?" and I said, "Yes."

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:54.920
"Your wife's gone into labor."

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:58.210
And I said, "No, I'm sorry, you've got the
wrong, you've got the wrong guy.

00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:01.190
My wife isn't due for another eight weeks."

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:03.580
They said, "No, come straight away."

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:09.111
So I, by the time I got from our house to
the hospital, my wife had given birth to a

00:25:09.111 --> 00:25:14.000
beautiful baby daughter and I was really excited,
but the doctor said, "Look, we just managed

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.340
to save your wife's life and we just managed
to save your daughter's life.

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:20.900
If you daughter survives the next three hours,
she'll be ok."

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:27.940
So my wife and I, you know, were at the bedside
and we prayed and, and my daughter did survive

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:33.980
the next three hours, but three days later
my, my daughter died in my arms.

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:36.940
And that's not something that I would wish
on my worst enemy.

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:37.940
You know?

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:41.390
For me that was my emptying out experience.

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:45.210
And that's when the decline started.

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:48.930
So to deal with the pain and the anguish I
tried alcohol.

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:49.960
And I don't drink alcohol.

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:53.160
Then I was prescribed antidepressants.

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.960
And I don't know if anyone's been on antidepressants,
but they make you feel really hazy.

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:56.960
Yeah.

00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:00.690
And at the time I was head of strategy for
one of Australia's largest fund managers.

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:03.980
Then I thought, hmm, I'm gonna get some drugs.

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:08.160
You know I hear people use drugs, I mean,
and then I'll get over this rough patch.

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:11.850
And while I was going to get those drugs,
something in the back of my voice said, "Kamal,

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:13.450
what the hell are you doing?

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:17.270
This is the point of no return."

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:18.790
And so I didn't try the drugs.

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:22.530
I went back to my monastic training.

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:24.970
And that's what pulled me out.

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:28.430
But I was so close to the edge.

00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:30.570
You with me?

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:34.110
And the sad thing is I see a lot of people
close to the edge.

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:35.260
And here's the funny thing.

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:41.900
The funny thing is all the leadership work
that I had done to date did not prepare me

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:43.960
for my biggest challenge.

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:47.370
My biggest challenge was first to lead myself.

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:48.780
Yep.

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:54.080
The second thing was to lead, so the second
thing was you know my relationship was falling

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.400
apart.

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:59.650
So for those people who don't know, you know
it's 50 percent of marriages don't last the

00:26:59.650 --> 00:27:00.650
distance.

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:02.180
You know that stat, yeah?

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:08.180
It's significantly higher, it's about 90-95
percent for couples that lose their first

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:09.180
child.

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:11.130
That's pretty high, right?

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:15.660
And so where I wanted to be a leader the most
was in my relationship.

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:18.190
And I couldn't even lead there.

00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:22.310
And so I started on a journey to try to understand
myself and understand my relationship and

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:24.440
that's where my leadership journey started.

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:28.770
Some of you have started your leadership journey,
some of you have not.

00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:31.890
Now I'm not saying because you are 'the' leader;
you are 'a' leader.

00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:33.370
You, do you get the difference?

00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:34.370
Yep?

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:38.730
There are a lot of people who have leadership
positions, but they aren't a leader.

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:39.730
You with me?

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:44.640
My belief is that you want every member in
your family to be a leader.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:48.060
You want every member of your team to be a
leader.

00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:51.919
It doesn't matter whether the, they're the
leader.

00:27:51.919 --> 00:27:58.570
The tragedy is is when the leader is not a
leader and there is a leadership void.

00:27:58.570 --> 00:27:59.570
You know?

00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:02.140
So there are four levels of leadership that
I want to talk to you about.

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:06.240
The first level of leadership is leading yourself.

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:09.260
Most people struggle with that, true or false?

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:11.800
Workaholic, chocoholic, alcoholic, you know?

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:13.110
Look at the people coming.

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:14.110
Go down the street.

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:15.180
Have a look at them.

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:18.500
See whether they've got a sense of vibrancy,
a sense of energy.

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:19.980
Most people don't.

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:24.440
Level two leadership is leading one other
person.

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:25.600
That could be your partner.

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.070
That could be your child.

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:29.470
That could be a member of your team.

00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:33.500
Level three leadership is leading a group
of people.

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:37.160
First and foremost that is your families,
yeah?

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:38.790
Or your teams.

00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:46.530
And level four leadership is leading even
when you are not there.

00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:50.750
That you have a presence even when you are
not present.

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:56.240
I will repeat that: that you have a presence
even when you're not present.

00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:01.990
I promise you this, that if you look deeply
into your life, one of the reasons why you're

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:08.500
in this room today working with this amazing
organization is that somebody stepped up in

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:11.020
your life to be a level four leader.

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:12.020
Yeah?

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:13.170
It could have been a parent.

00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:15.460
I could have been an uncle or auntie.

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:16.870
It could have been a teacher.

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:20.700
It could have been a brother, a sister.

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:22.970
But their presence is always there.

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:24.960
Here's the paradox.

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:29.480
The paradox is people struggle to stay present
even when they're in the room.

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:31.340
Who's noticed that?

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:32.340
Yep?

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:33.340
Go to your next meeting.

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:37.332
Go to your next meeting, go there a little
early and look at how many people are present

00:29:37.332 --> 00:29:42.590
in the room or how many people have checked
out to la la land, true or false guys?

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:43.590
Yeah?

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:44.690
So that's what we want to talk about here.

00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:45.750
Can I just?

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:46.810
&gt;&gt;male #1: Twice.

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:47.860
&gt;&gt;Kamal Sarma: Twice?

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:50.380
Sorry guys, I'm getting good at this.

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:54.560
[chuckles] Alright, so, how do you make that
transformation?

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.280
Are you interested?

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:57.280
Yep?

00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:59.530
From one s curve to the next s curve, yeah?

00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:01.470
Let's, let's talk about this transformation.

00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:06.500
Now, you can think about this in your relationship,
with your health, with your business or your

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:07.500
team, yep?

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:09.450
So we call this a model of transformation.

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:15.130
The first transform-, process of transformation
is awareness.

00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:19.790
Most people don't have any idea of how they're
treating themselves, their lives.

00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:22.720
They're too busy existing to feel alive.

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.670
You know what I mean by that?

00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:25.670
They're just rushing.

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:27.170
They're rushing from here to there.

00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:30.790
They feel that emptiness and they're just
trying to fill it up with being busy.

00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:34.880
Those are the people that get out their blackberries
or I'm sorry, their android phones.

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:37.440
[laughing] Whoops.

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.890
And check things, have you noticed those people
in meetings?

00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:41.280
Are you kidding me?

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:45.390
You can't be present just for the next 15
to 20 minutes while we have this conversation?

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:47.640
They're just busy existing.

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:51.430
And they're so afraid of missing out on stuff.

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:52.430
Ok.

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:55.070
The next step is accountability.

00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:58.950
We live in a society that takes less and less
accountability.

00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:01.540
Who's heard about the people that tried to
sue McDonald's for making them fat?

00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:03.120
Did you hear about that?

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.120
Yeah.

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:05.510
It's really simple, don't eat their crap.

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:06.510
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:08.080
Or eat it in moderation.

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.080
You with me?

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:14.080
Or there's, there was a guy in Australia that
was that sued the casino for making him gamble.

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:15.080
Hello.

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:16.120
[laughs] Don't gamble.

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:17.250
It's really simple.

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:21.350
But we live in a society that it's somebody
else's fault.

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:22.900
In a relationship, guys.

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:25.930
If the relationship's not working, whose fault
is it?

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:26.930
Theirs.

00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:29.080
[chuckles] You know the them?

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:30.080
The them.

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:31.560
There's always a them.

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:38.000
So we can tell you pretty quickly how dysfunctional
a team is by how many times attribute accountability

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.110
for their results to somebody else.

00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:41.110
Yeah?

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:42.110
Or in a relationship.

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:43.110
It's very quick.

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:44.110
Or in a team.

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:45.110
Yep.

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:48.140
So that's the next stage of transformation
is taking accountability.

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:50.440
I can change this if I choose to.

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:54.500
Number three is the why.

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:58.940
Most people start on a journey and they don't
know why.

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:01.320
Who's heard of people that can't give up smoking?

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:03.480
Anybody heard of people that can't give up
smoking, yeah?

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:04.480
So here's the deal.

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:08.410
They can't give up smoking, they can't give
up smoking, they've tried everything, they

00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:09.770
can't give up smoking.

00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:14.760
Then there are people can't give up smoking,
can't give up smoking, have a triple bypass,

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:16.900
guess what happens?

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:18.580
They give up smoking overnight.

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:20.630
Have you seen this?

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:21.630
Yeah?

00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:22.630
Why?

00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:24.630
Because they got a big enough why.

00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:26.970
Most people don't invest in the why.

00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:31.130
What they do is they get busy on the how.

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:37.050
So my belief is that if you want to step up
as a leader in your life or in the life of

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:40.480
somebody else, you have to have a big enough
why.

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:45.570
If you don't, please don't start, because
you will not be successful.

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:47.680
So my wife's a doctor.

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:53.870
And you know how your family can cut you down
to size if your head's getting too big?

00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:54.870
Yeah?

00:32:54.870 --> 00:33:00.420
So my wife, you know I was giving a speech
and I was explaining this and she said, "Kamal,

00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:02.920
I've got this patient, and what you said is
not true."

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:03.920
I said, "What do you mean?"

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:07.840
And she said, "I've got a patient who can't
give up smoking, can't give up smoking, has

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:12.200
a triple bypass, still cannot give up smoking."

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:16.770
So she's having the conversation around, you
know what, we're gonna have to cut off your

00:33:16.770 --> 00:33:17.770
leg.

00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:18.770
You've seen the ads and stuff like that.

00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:20.590
The gangrene sets in and stuff like that.

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:22.820
And do you know what he said to her?

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:29.170
"Guess what, doc, I can't give up smoking,
you're gonna have to cut off my leg."

00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:32.020
Even that was not a big enough why.

00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:34.690
You with me?

00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:37.970
Now that would mostly be a why for us.

00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:40.890
So I just kind of extricated myself from that
situation and I said, "Ah, honey, I don't

00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:41.890
know."

00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:47.050
Anyway, three months later, she comes back
and said, "Kamal, you know that guy that couldn't

00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:48.050
give up smoking?"

00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:49.050
I said, "Yeah."

00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:50.050
"Guess what?

00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:51.050
He gave up smoking overnight."

00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:52.130
I said, "No way, what's the deal?"

00:33:52.130 --> 00:34:01.420
The deal was, you know I thought it was the
patches or hypnosis or acupuncture.

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:07.170
What happened was, is that he had his first
grandchild.

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:10.419
And his grandchild had a bit of asthma.

00:34:10.419 --> 00:34:17.159
And the father, who was his son, said to the
grandfather, "You cannot go anywhere near

00:34:17.159 --> 00:34:19.369
my child."

00:34:19.369 --> 00:34:22.409
And that was a big enough why for him.

00:34:22.409 --> 00:34:26.389
Now I want to tell you the kind of, the, the
real story behind this.

00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:32.779
He had come to Australia as an immigrant at
17 years old with only the shirt on his back.

00:34:32.779 --> 00:34:33.950
He worked as a concreter.

00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:36.299
You know this big, burly guy.

00:34:36.299 --> 00:34:37.299
Yeah?

00:34:37.299 --> 00:34:38.940
He worked to get all his kids through university.

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:40.609
He worked really, really hard.

00:34:40.609 --> 00:34:45.440
Did not see his kids, but wanted to make sure
that he provided for him.

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:49.589
He was the sole survivor of his village.

00:34:49.589 --> 00:34:52.889
He was the sole survivor of his family.

00:34:52.889 --> 00:34:56.379
They had all died at the hands of the fascists.

00:34:56.379 --> 00:35:00.880
Now he sees the embodiment of everything that
he's worked for.

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:02.220
You with me?

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:06.039
And he can't go anywhere near him.

00:35:06.039 --> 00:35:14.980
So your responsibility as a leader is to figure
out your own why and to figure out others'

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:15.980
why.

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:16.980
Not your why.

00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:19.900
What most people are doing in a relationship,
in a team, is what?

00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:24.740
Is giving their why, not the other person's
why.

00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:28.249
And to do that you need some skills.

00:35:28.249 --> 00:35:30.499
What got you here is not gonna get you there.

00:35:30.499 --> 00:35:31.499
Yeah?

00:35:31.499 --> 00:35:35.089
Who's heard, do unto others as you want done
unto you?

00:35:35.089 --> 00:35:36.740
Brilliant advice.

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:38.990
What you also need to consider is this.

00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:42.619
Do unto others as they want done unto them.

00:35:42.619 --> 00:35:43.619
You with me?

00:35:43.619 --> 00:35:46.410
But you need a different skill set to do that.

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:48.579
The next step of the transformation process
is the how.

00:35:48.579 --> 00:35:53.650
The how is the systems, the process, the frameworks,
the knowledge.

00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:58.299
Most people are struggling with management
hows, let alone leadership hows.

00:35:58.299 --> 00:36:02.509
Most people are put in leadership positions
or leadership roles be to lead themselves

00:36:02.509 --> 00:36:04.039
to lead to others.

00:36:04.039 --> 00:36:06.279
And they have not had the right skills and
tools.

00:36:06.279 --> 00:36:11.269
So they're working hard at being a better
manager, but not with the right skills and

00:36:11.269 --> 00:36:13.329
tools and that's why they're stuffing up.

00:36:13.329 --> 00:36:16.499
So can I use that word, stuffing up? [laughing].

00:36:16.499 --> 00:36:20.180
So you gotta go and get the right skills to
do that.

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:22.130
The next step is mastery.

00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:26.880
Mastery, do you think most people like to
be masters?

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:27.880
They do.

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:29.450
But do you think most people are?

00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:30.450
No.

00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:31.450
Why?

00:36:31.450 --> 00:36:36.999
Because it's boring as bat poop. [laughing]
What mastery is about is doing something over

00:36:36.999 --> 00:36:41.010
and over again and again a little bit better
each time.

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:46.250
But what we do, especially as intellectuals,
is this, is we find and look for something

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:47.250
new.

00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:48.250
You with me?

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:49.250
Yeah?

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:50.390
You look for something new here, look for
new something there.

00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:54.800
It's like, you know, go to any garage sale,
any garage, this is some of the things you'll

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:55.800
find.

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:56.800
You'll find an ab blaster.

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:57.800
Remember those things?

00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:58.800
Yep.

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.809
You'll find a treadmill and you'll find an
exercise bike.

00:37:00.809 --> 00:37:01.839
True or false?

00:37:01.839 --> 00:37:02.839
Yep.

00:37:02.839 --> 00:37:05.819
It's not that, it's not that hard to lose
weight.

00:37:05.819 --> 00:37:08.240
It's eat half as much, move twice as much.

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:09.240
Yep.

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:10.549
But people dabble.

00:37:10.549 --> 00:37:11.819
They go here, they go there.

00:37:11.819 --> 00:37:15.930
They try and find new things all the time
rather than choosing mastery.

00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:20.529
And one of the things that mental resilience
is about is mastering your own mind.

00:37:20.529 --> 00:37:22.640
Do you have control over your mind?

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:26.920
Do you choose your own thoughts or do the
thoughts choose you?

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:29.480
Most people don't know how to do that.

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:30.480
Yeah?

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:31.579
The last thing is feedback.

00:37:31.579 --> 00:37:36.780
You need to get feedback in your life to get
from one s curve to the next s curve.

00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:40.930
So this is about what standard you accept
for yourself.

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:45.020
Most people don't get enough feedback and
here's the real paradox.

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:49.880
The paradox is the sooner you go, the less
and less feedback you get.

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:54.190
The person who gets the most feedback is the
person who's the intern.

00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:57.309
The person who gets the least feedback is
the CEO.

00:37:57.309 --> 00:37:58.720
Go figure.

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:01.390
Who gets the most feedback, the kid or the
parent?

00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:04.020
The kid, right?

00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:08.700
And my belief is that you need feedback to,
to make sure that you get from one s curve

00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:09.700
to the next s curve.

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:10.970
I want to tell you a very quick story.

00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:11.970
I've got a mentor.

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:14.099
Can I get a show of hands, who's got a mentor
in this room?

00:38:14.099 --> 00:38:15.099
Yep.

00:38:15.099 --> 00:38:16.099
Ok.

00:38:16.099 --> 00:38:17.190
Who mentors somebody else?

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:18.190
Yep.

00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:19.190
Fantastic.

00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:24.039
If there's one thing you take out of today,
I'd hope it is go and find yourself a mentor.

00:38:24.039 --> 00:38:26.029
Let me tell you the story of my mentor.

00:38:26.029 --> 00:38:28.210
My name, my mentor's name is Les.

00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:34.869
And Les is a very, very lovely Scottish man
and he's been my mentor for the last 15 years.

00:38:34.869 --> 00:38:39.260
And one day I'm kind of you know having my
mentor-type discussion with him and getting

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:44.589
all this beautiful insights and stuff like
that and he gets really angry with me and

00:38:44.589 --> 00:38:52.420
he grabs my notepad and he writes, "Kamal
Sarma is a liar."

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:53.420
So what do you think guys?

00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:56.880
Do you think I was a liar?

00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:58.200
Yes.

00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:59.519
Yeah.

00:38:59.519 --> 00:39:00.519
I was lying.

00:39:00.519 --> 00:39:03.220
I was lying to myself.

00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:04.960
Most people, and you know what?

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:10.510
Les was the only person who loved me enough,
who cared for me enough, that was willing

00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:12.759
to tell me that.

00:39:12.759 --> 00:39:17.690
Most of the time we do not surround ourselves
with people that will call ourselves liars,

00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:19.279
yes or no?

00:39:19.279 --> 00:39:20.279
No.

00:39:20.279 --> 00:39:24.630
We surround ourselves with people that will
tell us what we want to hear, true or false?

00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:25.630
Yeah.

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:30.670
You need to find somebody that's willing to
call you a liar to your face.

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:35.630
Because I was giving him all the excuses why
I should stay on one s curve.

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:38.210
And that's why I was living a pretty mediocre
life.

00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:42.450
And he was the only person willing to sacri-,
almost willing to sacrifice the relationship

00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:44.940
to make sure I got that message.

00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:48.470
Ok, so, what is the leadership journeys about?

00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:52.019
So, do you all have targets, yes or no?

00:39:52.019 --> 00:39:53.220
Yes or no?

00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:54.220
Really?

00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:55.220
Ok, I'm just kidding.

00:39:55.220 --> 00:40:02.309
[laughing] If your resilience level is at
that space, what does that gap feel like guys?

00:40:02.309 --> 00:40:03.910
What emotions are you feeling there?

00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:06.690
Sorry, hopeless, helpless, yeah.

00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:09.079
I call it stress, let's be politically correct
here.

00:40:09.079 --> 00:40:10.079
Stress.

00:40:10.079 --> 00:40:11.490
Do you see a lot of people around you that
are stressed?

00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:12.910
Oh yes you do.

00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:16.099
I was just hanging around here for a couple
of hours and I was noticing how stressed people

00:40:16.099 --> 00:40:17.099
are.

00:40:17.099 --> 00:40:18.099
The exhaustion.

00:40:18.099 --> 00:40:19.099
The level of depletion.

00:40:19.099 --> 00:40:20.099
Yep.

00:40:20.099 --> 00:40:23.220
Now do your targets generally go up or down?

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:24.220
Up.

00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:25.220
Right?

00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:28.470
And my belief is you cannot do the extraordinary
when you're stressed.

00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:29.470
Yep.

00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:31.789
You can do the mediocre, but you can't do
the extraordinary.

00:40:31.789 --> 00:40:32.789
Yep.

00:40:32.789 --> 00:40:36.499
So what we want to do is we want to increase
your level of resilience.

00:40:36.499 --> 00:40:40.000
And that takes that transformation formula
that we talked about.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:46.460
And so what that requires is if, if your resilience
level is higher than your targets, what does

00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:47.930
that feel like?

00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:50.049
Anybody know?

00:40:50.049 --> 00:40:51.049
That feels like flow.

00:40:51.049 --> 00:40:53.529
Do you know what flow is?

00:40:53.529 --> 00:40:56.170
Flow is an amazing experience.

00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:58.579
It's where the extraordinary happens.

00:40:58.579 --> 00:41:02.589
It's where even after intense work you don't
feel tired.

00:41:02.589 --> 00:41:04.140
Who's experienced that?

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:05.210
Yep.

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:06.210
Most people don't.

00:41:06.210 --> 00:41:10.990
And I know, you know as well go outside, go
and sit on the sidewalk and have a look at

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:13.099
people walking into the building.

00:41:13.099 --> 00:41:16.559
See whether they're in a state of flow or
absolute depletion, exhaustion.

00:41:16.559 --> 00:41:22.549
Now obviously, if your resilience level increases,
you can get to a sense of boredom, right?

00:41:22.549 --> 00:41:25.480
And that's why people go out and get bigger
and bigger challenges.

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:27.869
There's part of you that likes to be stressed.

00:41:27.869 --> 00:41:33.609
But whether you're going to be in a state
of flow or in a state of depletion depends

00:41:33.609 --> 00:41:36.220
on whether what your resilience levels are
at.

00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:37.220
Ok.

00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:38.760
So I'm very conscious of the time.

00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:40.210
I've only got 15 minutes.

00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:44.130
So, if I could synthesize everything that
I've learned from being a monk to a venture

00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:48.000
capitalist into one formula, this would be
it.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.000
Right?

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.880
That I think what you need in your relationship
is resilience.

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:55.849
What you need in your team is resilience.

00:41:55.849 --> 00:41:59.009
Having strategies are great, but most strategies
don't work.

00:41:59.009 --> 00:42:02.830
Not because they're bad strategies, but because
there's not enough resilience to carry it

00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:03.830
out.

00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:08.410
You know you get the nice PowerPoint slides
and all that kind of stuff, but you need resilience.

00:42:08.410 --> 00:42:12.170
And so if I could synthesize everything that
I learned, resilience is a function of three

00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:13.170
things.

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:14.170
Number one is you need direction.

00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:15.390
You need to know where you're going.

00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:17.970
Number two is you need to have the right capability
set.

00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:24.980
Once again, most people only have management
capabilities rather than leadership capabilities.

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:30.049
Most people in their relationship don't have
the right relationship skills until it's too,

00:42:30.049 --> 00:42:33.530
you know it's, it's, it's, things go wrong.

00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:38.420
You need to invest in those relationship skills
now before things go wrong.

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:41.299
And lastly you need energy.

00:42:41.299 --> 00:42:42.739
So let's talk about this.

00:42:42.739 --> 00:42:46.080
So anybody know a gentleman called Peter Drucker?

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:47.080
Yep.

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:48.080
Yep.

00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:49.080
Very well known leadership commentator.

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:50.529
And he said this.

00:42:50.529 --> 00:42:56.550
"Your primary role of, your primary role as
a leader is to raise your own level of energy,

00:42:56.550 --> 00:43:01.150
then to orchestrate the to raise the level
of energy around you."

00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:05.349
What leadership is about is fundamentally
focusing on energy.

00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:09.310
And if you look at the state of depletion
of your colleagues, not in your, not, not

00:43:09.310 --> 00:43:14.190
in this organization, in other organizations,
you know, look at how tired they are at 1:00

00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:18.930
in the afternoon, then you will be able to
determine whether they have an impact where

00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:21.220
people will choose to follow them, alright?

00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:24.210
So this is a great rule, but I want to give
you good, a tool.

00:43:24.210 --> 00:43:25.210
Is that ok?

00:43:25.210 --> 00:43:29.900
Just give you a tool on how you can, so you
might want to draw this as you go, as you

00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:31.589
go, as you go through this.

00:43:31.589 --> 00:43:33.739
So, your energy can be the high or low.

00:43:33.739 --> 00:43:35.140
Does everybody get that?

00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:36.140
Yep.

00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:39.369
And your energy can be either empowered or
disempowered.

00:43:39.369 --> 00:43:40.369
Right.

00:43:40.369 --> 00:43:41.609
So let's have a look at this.

00:43:41.609 --> 00:43:46.329
If your energy is high and disempowered, what
kind of emotions are you feeling?

00:43:46.329 --> 00:43:49.190
Sir, in the black shirt, what kind of emotions
are you feeling?

00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:50.710
So you've got a lot of energy.

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:51.710
&gt;&gt;male #2: Frustrated.

00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:52.710
&gt;&gt;Kamal Sarma: Frustrated.

00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:53.710
Yep.

00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:54.710
Help him out guys.

00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:55.710
What, what kind of emotions?

00:43:55.710 --> 00:43:56.710
&gt;&gt;male #3: Bored.

00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:57.710
&gt;&gt;Kamal Sarma: Bored.

00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:58.710
Ohh, yeah, we'll come to that.

00:43:58.710 --> 00:43:59.710
&gt;&gt;male #4: You don't have any influence.

00:43:59.710 --> 00:44:00.710
&gt;&gt;Kamal Sarma: Not having influence.

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:01.710
Yeah.

00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:02.710
So we call this a red box.

00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:05.869
This is angry, fearful, anxious, agitated.

00:44:05.869 --> 00:44:08.170
Who has met people that live in this red box?

00:44:08.170 --> 00:44:09.170
No?

00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:10.170
Fantastic.

00:44:10.170 --> 00:44:11.170
Yep.

00:44:11.170 --> 00:44:12.170
And they're wonderful leaders to follow, aren't
they?

00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:13.170
[chuckles] Ok.

00:44:13.170 --> 00:44:16.089
Then what about low and disempowered?

00:44:16.089 --> 00:44:18.349
Now I know you've never been there, but ma'am,
what do you think?

00:44:18.349 --> 00:44:20.200
What kind of emotions are you feeling there?

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:21.440
Disengaged, yeah.

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:23.300
Help her out.

00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:24.540
Come on.

00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:25.780
Depressed, yeah.

00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:27.020
What else?

00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:28.020
Sorry?

00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:29.020
Depressed, yeah.

00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:30.440
We call this the black box.

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:33.319
Depressed, apathetic, burned out, hopeless,
defeated.

00:44:33.319 --> 00:44:35.130
Who knows of people that live in this box?

00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:36.130
Yeah.

00:44:36.130 --> 00:44:37.130
Alright.

00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:38.130
Now for the good stuff.

00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:39.349
Let me see here.

00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:40.349
Ok.

00:44:40.349 --> 00:44:42.640
You're feeling high and empowered.

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:45.230
So what kind of energy are you feeling there?

00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:47.940
What kind of, what kind of emotions are you
feeling there?

00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:50.619
[pause] Fantastic.

00:44:50.619 --> 00:44:54.150
Ok, we call this the blue box.

00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:55.150
It's high empowered.

00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:58.890
It's you know it's invigorated, focused, challenged,
delighted, engaged.

00:44:58.890 --> 00:44:59.890
Alright.

00:44:59.890 --> 00:45:00.890
Ok.

00:45:00.890 --> 00:45:01.890
Now for the next box.

00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:04.520
Sir, in the white shirt.

00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:06.569
What about low and empowered?

00:45:06.569 --> 00:45:08.290
What kind of emotions are you feeling there?

00:45:08.290 --> 00:45:09.990
&gt;&gt;male #5: [inaudible]

00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:13.390
&gt;&gt;Kamal Sarma: Fantastic, great, well done.

00:45:13.390 --> 00:45:16.650
Yeah most of the time most of the people get
this box wrong.

00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:19.000
We call this the orange box.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.000
You with me?

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.239
So called the orange box.

00:45:21.239 --> 00:45:23.170
Now, look at those four boxes.

00:45:23.170 --> 00:45:24.200
Where do you?

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:28.079
If you were to allocate 100 percent of your
time, how would you allocate that 100 percent

00:45:28.079 --> 00:45:29.079
of your time?

00:45:29.079 --> 00:45:30.079
Which boxes?

00:45:30.079 --> 00:45:31.089
You don't need to shout it out.

00:45:31.089 --> 00:45:32.549
[laughing] Where would you allocate?

00:45:32.549 --> 00:45:37.359
Is it 20 percent in the red, 20 percent in
the black, 20 percent in the blue and the

00:45:37.359 --> 00:45:38.359
orange.

00:45:38.359 --> 00:45:39.359
You with me guys?

00:45:39.359 --> 00:45:40.499
Ok, just allocate, just in your head.

00:45:40.499 --> 00:45:41.499
Two seconds.

00:45:41.499 --> 00:45:42.499
Alright.

00:45:42.499 --> 00:45:43.499
So here's the deal.

00:45:43.499 --> 00:45:50.160
The deal is you can only lead in the orange
and the blue.

00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:55.220
In the red or the black people are serving
you or getting the heck out of your way, true

00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:56.839
or false?

00:45:56.839 --> 00:45:57.839
Yep.

00:45:57.839 --> 00:46:01.109
And this is the funny thing, is I don't believe
in time management.

00:46:01.109 --> 00:46:04.589
I believe in energy management.

00:46:04.589 --> 00:46:10.999
Most people are giving their best energy to
the people that will not rock up at their

00:46:10.999 --> 00:46:11.999
funerals.

00:46:11.999 --> 00:46:13.339
I will repeat that.

00:46:13.339 --> 00:46:18.849
Most people are giving their best energy to
the people that will not rock up at their

00:46:18.849 --> 00:46:19.849
funerals.

00:46:19.849 --> 00:46:20.849
Who's ever done this?

00:46:20.849 --> 00:46:21.849
Yeah?

00:46:21.849 --> 00:46:24.410
You've come home you've said, "Honey, kids,
I'm tired."

00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:25.410
Yeah?

00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:27.910
You come home, "I'm exhausted, that was really
tough."

00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:28.930
And then the boss calls.

00:46:28.930 --> 00:46:30.569
"Hey, how you doing?"

00:46:30.569 --> 00:46:31.799
Who's done that?

00:46:31.799 --> 00:46:32.799
Yep.

00:46:32.799 --> 00:46:34.309
And you can switch it on, right?

00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:37.769
And that's why most people are getting depleted,
they're getting exhausted.

00:46:37.769 --> 00:46:45.920
Now, which box, which box are you more likely
to overeat in?

00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:48.269
Which box are you more likely to overeat in?

00:46:48.269 --> 00:46:49.269
&gt;&gt;audience: Black.

00:46:49.269 --> 00:46:50.269
&gt;&gt;Kamal Sarma: Black.

00:46:50.269 --> 00:46:52.470
Yes, some people do the comfort eating in
the black box.

00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:57.410
Which box are you more likely to write that
e-mail that you're gonna regret?

00:46:57.410 --> 00:46:59.220
[laughing] You with me?

00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:01.069
And so it's not about time management.

00:47:01.069 --> 00:47:02.190
It's about energy management.

00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:06.849
It's about having the skills and tools to
be in the right box.

00:47:06.849 --> 00:47:09.760
Unfortunately, people manage these boxes synthetically.

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:13.180
And I've had a look at the coffee queues.

00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:16.369
Go at 9:00 in the morning and look at the
coffee queues.

00:47:16.369 --> 00:47:18.359
Most people are depleted and exhausted.

00:47:18.359 --> 00:47:21.800
So this is the general trajectory that most
people do.

00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:24.029
They start in the blue box, yep.

00:47:24.029 --> 00:47:25.039
Everything's great.

00:47:25.039 --> 00:47:32.210
Now as a carbon based life form, can you sustain
365, 24/7 in the blue box, yes or no?

00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:33.210
No.

00:47:33.210 --> 00:47:34.210
Do most people try it?

00:47:34.210 --> 00:47:35.210
Oh, yes, they do.

00:47:35.210 --> 00:47:36.210
Yep.

00:47:36.210 --> 00:47:37.480
And do you know where most people go?

00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:40.690
They go into the black box.

00:47:40.690 --> 00:47:43.249
They get depleted, they get exhausted.

00:47:43.249 --> 00:47:45.579
A lot of people, you know that stat I put
up about depression.

00:47:45.579 --> 00:47:47.819
And we see a lot of depression in the workplace.

00:47:47.819 --> 00:47:49.589
I don't think people are depressed.

00:47:49.589 --> 00:47:50.589
I think they're depleted.

00:47:50.589 --> 00:47:54.059
They're depleted emotionally, they're depleted
physically, they're depleted spiritually,

00:47:54.059 --> 00:47:58.769
whatever you like to say.

00:47:58.769 --> 00:48:02.690
And then what happens is people jump down
to the black box, but do people like to be

00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:05.019
in the black box, yes or no?

00:48:05.019 --> 00:48:06.019
No.

00:48:06.019 --> 00:48:11.450
So what they do is they then jump up to the
red box and they take it out on the people

00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:12.609
they love the most.

00:48:12.609 --> 00:48:14.849
Do you know why?

00:48:14.849 --> 00:48:17.549
Because they're the only people that will
take it from them.

00:48:17.549 --> 00:48:18.749
You with me?

00:48:18.749 --> 00:48:27.369
So your ability to lead is your ability to
fluctuate between the blue and the orange.

00:48:27.369 --> 00:48:29.779
You need to be able to shut down.

00:48:29.779 --> 00:48:31.589
Most people don't know how to shut down.

00:48:31.589 --> 00:48:36.299
I was gonna do an exercise with you to show
how you cannot, but I want to give you some

00:48:36.299 --> 00:48:40.020
examples of what this orange box is like.

00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:41.920
Has anybody noticed that mental chatter?

00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:46.289
You know, it's in the shower, it's when you're
driving, that nen, nen, nen, nen, nen, nen.

00:48:46.289 --> 00:48:47.479
Who's experienced that mental chatter?

00:48:47.479 --> 00:48:48.479
Yep.

00:48:48.479 --> 00:48:49.849
It's there all the time isn't it?

00:48:49.849 --> 00:48:51.519
It doesn't go away.

00:48:51.519 --> 00:48:54.960
Can you shut that mental chatter off?

00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:57.049
That is what the orange box is like.

00:48:57.049 --> 00:48:58.049
Most people can't.

00:48:58.049 --> 00:49:01.749
I'm gonna give you a, are you up for an exercise?

00:49:01.749 --> 00:49:02.749
Yep.

00:49:02.749 --> 00:49:03.749
Ok.

00:49:03.749 --> 00:49:04.749
Everybody sit up straight.

00:49:04.749 --> 00:49:05.989
Everybody sit up straight.

00:49:05.989 --> 00:49:07.529
And I want you to close your eyes.

00:49:07.529 --> 00:49:08.529
Ok.

00:49:08.529 --> 00:49:11.499
So don't lean on, lean on the back of your
chair, just sit up straight.

00:49:11.499 --> 00:49:12.499
Yep.

00:49:12.499 --> 00:49:13.499
Just close your eyes for a second.

00:49:13.499 --> 00:49:15.180
I'm just gonna take you through a little exercise.

00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:16.180
Alright.

00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:20.880
And what I want you to do is think about nothing
else, but just stay present in this room.

00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:23.579
Do not go to what you're gonna be doing this
afternoon.

00:49:23.579 --> 00:49:25.989
Don't go to what you're doing, what you did
yesterday.

00:49:25.989 --> 00:49:26.989
Ok.

00:49:26.989 --> 00:49:28.339
Everybody close your eyes.

00:49:28.339 --> 00:49:29.339
Take a deep breath in.

00:49:29.339 --> 00:49:48.930
[inhaling] Breathe out.

00:49:48.930 --> 00:51:22.670
[exhaling] Now just stay in the room, try
not to let your thoughts wander.

00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:36.059
[long pause]

00:51:36.059 --> 00:52:03.049
&gt;&gt;Kamal Sarma: Now gently breathe in.

00:52:03.049 --> 00:52:07.989
[inhaling and exhaling] And then when you're
ready open your eyes.

00:52:07.989 --> 00:52:08.989
Fantastic.

00:52:08.989 --> 00:52:09.989
Ok.

00:52:09.989 --> 00:52:13.690
Let's get some results.

00:52:13.690 --> 00:52:14.690
Ok.

00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:15.859
Let's get a show of hands.

00:52:15.859 --> 00:52:19.130
First of all, who heard the mental chatter?

00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:21.890
Did anybody hear the mental chatter?

00:52:21.890 --> 00:52:26.010
Who heard absolutely nothing, it was totally
quiet in there?

00:52:26.010 --> 00:52:28.390
Oh, brilliant, you're in the right place.

00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:30.920
So that mental chatter is incredibly exhausting.

00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:32.290
Do you know what I mean by that?

00:52:32.290 --> 00:52:33.859
That will deplete you.

00:52:33.859 --> 00:52:39.910
That will deplete you emotionally, spiritually,
intellectually, but physically, whatever.

00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:43.329
What you need to be able to do is you need
to be able to shut that down.

00:52:43.329 --> 00:52:45.319
Now the book is about shutting things down.

00:52:45.319 --> 00:52:47.660
The next book about is on leadership.

00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:51.369
But what you've got in the book there is really
an, a way to shut that down.

00:52:51.369 --> 00:52:54.369
You need to be able to switch off.

00:52:54.369 --> 00:52:55.759
Most people don't.

00:52:55.759 --> 00:53:00.640
If you can switch off that mental chatter,
imagine if you're having a discussion with

00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:01.920
your partner.

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:05.630
How amazing will that chat be?

00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:10.119
Imagine if you have that sense of presence
when you are speaking.

00:53:10.119 --> 00:53:11.150
You know that focus?

00:53:11.150 --> 00:53:15.509
Would you like to know how good your focus
will be, guys, if you can get good at this

00:53:15.509 --> 00:53:16.509
stuff?

00:53:16.509 --> 00:53:17.509
Would you like to know, yes or no?

00:53:17.509 --> 00:53:18.509
Yep.

00:53:18.509 --> 00:53:19.710
Ok, everybody stand up for a second.

00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:25.259
How much time do we have by the way?

00:53:25.259 --> 00:53:26.259
It's about 12:54.

00:53:26.259 --> 00:53:27.369
About 5 minutes.

00:53:27.369 --> 00:53:28.369
Ok.

00:53:28.369 --> 00:53:29.369
I'll be really quick.

00:53:29.369 --> 00:53:30.369
Ok.

00:53:30.369 --> 00:53:33.270
This is, so remember the focu-, you remember
how your mind was wandering?

00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:34.270
Yeah?

00:53:34.270 --> 00:53:35.270
Your mind was wandering.

00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:37.160
I want to show you that if you'd get this
skill.

00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:38.980
If you build some mental bench strength.

00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:42.900
If you build some mental resilience, this
is what your focus will be.

00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:46.869
So just, I want to, I want you to think about
what's gonna happen to your thoughts.

00:53:46.869 --> 00:53:47.869
Ok.

00:53:47.869 --> 00:53:48.869
So I'm gonna ask you to breathe in.

00:53:48.869 --> 00:53:49.869
I'm gonna ask you to breathe out.

00:53:49.869 --> 00:53:50.869
Breathe in.

00:53:50.869 --> 00:53:51.869
Breathe out.

00:53:51.869 --> 00:53:52.869
And then hold your breath.

00:53:52.869 --> 00:53:53.869
Ok, ready?

00:53:53.869 --> 00:53:54.869
Breathe in.

00:53:54.869 --> 00:53:55.869
[inhaling] Breathe out.

00:53:55.869 --> 00:53:56.869
[exhaling] Breathe in.

00:53:56.869 --> 00:53:58.859
[inhaling] Breathe out.

00:53:58.859 --> 00:54:01.290
[exhaling] Now keep your breath out.

00:54:01.290 --> 00:54:04.560
Don't breath in.

00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:08.930
Just hold your breath.

00:54:08.930 --> 00:54:10.020
One.

00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:11.109
Two.

00:54:11.109 --> 00:54:12.200
Three.

00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:13.290
Four.

00:54:13.290 --> 00:54:14.390
Five.

00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:15.480
Six.

00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:16.569
Seven.

00:54:16.569 --> 00:54:19.849
Eight, Nine, Ten.

00:54:19.849 --> 00:54:20.849
Breathe in.

00:54:20.849 --> 00:54:23.650
[exhaling] Sit down.

00:54:23.650 --> 00:54:29.410
So when I was about eight or nine, I promise
you you weren't thinking about anything else

00:54:29.410 --> 00:54:32.109
except about when is that bloody Kamal going
to say ten?

00:54:32.109 --> 00:54:33.229
You with me, true or false?

00:54:33.229 --> 00:54:38.710
Wouldn't you love that kind of intensity and
that type of focus in your relationships?

00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:39.989
Or what about with your work?

00:54:39.989 --> 00:54:40.989
Yeah?

00:54:40.989 --> 00:54:43.640
The orange box is where true genius comes
from.

00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:45.529
Where was Einstein when he discovered E=mc2?

00:54:45.529 --> 00:54:48.089
Not in an office.

00:54:48.089 --> 00:54:53.739
[laughing] He, he was, he was 54:51.6 [laughter]
Where was Archimedes when he discovered, eureka,

00:54:53.739 --> 00:54:57.789
eureka, I found it, the general displacement
of water theory?

00:54:57.789 --> 00:54:59.410
In the bathtub.

00:54:59.410 --> 00:55:00.410
Yep.

00:55:00.410 --> 00:55:01.410
You need the orange box.

00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:02.410
Ok.

00:55:02.410 --> 00:55:03.410
I've run out of time.

00:55:03.410 --> 00:55:04.410
I have this much content.

00:55:04.410 --> 00:55:07.410
I have this much time, so I had to skip through
a few things.

00:55:07.410 --> 00:55:09.249
I'd like to finish up with a story if I may.

00:55:09.249 --> 00:55:10.249
Would that be ok?

00:55:10.249 --> 00:55:16.739
I think stories have the ability to transform
lives, so part of my healing process was we

00:55:16.739 --> 00:55:21.880
do a lot of work with prevention of youth
suicide.

00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:26.979
We do a lot of prevention, so, we do a lot
of work with kids that are traumatized and

00:55:26.979 --> 00:55:28.430
we, we help them.

00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:32.559
We do a lot of work around the world with
rescuing young girls from sexual slavery.

00:55:32.559 --> 00:55:35.789
So we do some work in Nepal and India.

00:55:35.789 --> 00:55:38.489
If you'd like to find more information, love
your help.

00:55:38.489 --> 00:55:40.180
So that was a sales pitch.

00:55:40.180 --> 00:55:45.309
There's a lady by the name of Anuradha Koirala,
if you could Google her that would be great.

00:55:45.309 --> 00:55:49.829
She, you know she rescues girls that have
been kidnapped into sexual slavery as young

00:55:49.829 --> 00:55:50.829
as six.

00:55:50.829 --> 00:55:53.579
They are pumped full of hormones until they're
eight.

00:55:53.579 --> 00:56:00.369
They're raped 20-35 times a day until they're
the age of, until the age of 12.

00:56:00.369 --> 00:56:04.650
By that time they're, they're just exhausted
mentally, physically they're just a wreck

00:56:04.650 --> 00:56:06.700
and they're thrown out.

00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:09.740
And there is a story that's changed my life.

00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:12.249
And that was the story that I'm about to tell
you now.

00:56:12.249 --> 00:56:17.059
It, it stopped me from wanting me to be a
venture capitalist to doing what I do now

00:56:17.059 --> 00:56:19.910
and that is run a leadership firm.

00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:23.140
And this story happened in Vietnam.

00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:27.400
It's a story about a war.

00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:34.099
It's a story between American GIs and the
Viet Cong.

00:56:34.099 --> 00:56:39.880
It's about a battle that takes place that's
taken place for over three days, three days.

00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:41.259
A lot of fighting.

00:56:41.259 --> 00:56:46.599
Now we call these American GIs, but what was
the average age of these American GIs?

00:56:46.599 --> 00:56:48.250
Does anybody know?

00:56:48.250 --> 00:56:49.250
Nineteen.

00:56:49.250 --> 00:56:51.299
Do you remember when you were 19?

00:56:51.299 --> 00:56:53.310
I was scared of everything.

00:56:53.310 --> 00:56:58.400
The first time some of these kids had gone
from West Virginia or Arkansas they were dropped

00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:00.249
into a jungle.

00:57:00.249 --> 00:57:04.809
These kids, the only way they could survive,
some of them, was to take drugs to deal with

00:57:04.809 --> 00:57:05.809
the fear.

00:57:05.809 --> 00:57:06.809
Yep.

00:57:06.809 --> 00:57:10.460
Now we call these kids, these people the Viet
Cong.

00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:12.479
But who were they really?

00:57:12.479 --> 00:57:17.950
They were moms and dads, they were farmers,
they were accountants, they were lawyers.

00:57:17.950 --> 00:57:20.809
They were just like you and me, true or false?

00:57:20.809 --> 00:57:21.809
Yeah.

00:57:21.809 --> 00:57:27.210
So this wasn't a battle between American GIs
and the Viet Cong.

00:57:27.210 --> 00:57:35.640
It was a battle that took place between scared
young kids, yeah, and moms and dads.

00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:36.829
You with me?

00:57:36.829 --> 00:57:41.690
Sometimes got so bad in the, with the Viet
Cong, they used to dig tunnels.

00:57:41.690 --> 00:57:47.890
These, the Viet Cong used to suffocate their
babies when they used to cry to death so that

00:57:47.890 --> 00:57:49.930
they wouldn't give away their position.

00:57:49.930 --> 00:57:52.319
This is a horrendous time.

00:57:52.319 --> 00:57:56.430
The reason why I'm sharing this story with
you is that I think we all have a responsibility

00:57:56.430 --> 00:57:57.490
to step up as a leader.

00:57:57.490 --> 00:58:04.059
Google is in an amazing, amazing position
in the, the kind of in history, that you have

00:58:04.059 --> 00:58:07.039
taken a leadership position in a very short
period of time.

00:58:07.039 --> 00:58:08.910
I get to speak to the future leaders of Google.

00:58:08.910 --> 00:58:11.190
How cool is this?

00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:13.950
Maybe this story might make an impact on you.

00:58:13.950 --> 00:58:17.749
So into this battle come six monks.

00:58:17.749 --> 00:58:22.950
Now these six monks were not wearing army
fatigue.

00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:24.460
They didn't have guns.

00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:30.240
The only thing they had was their begging
bowls.

00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:36.069
And they carried those begging bowls and they
started to walk across the patty field.

00:58:36.069 --> 00:58:38.229
They didn't run.

00:58:38.229 --> 00:58:39.690
They didn't hide.

00:58:39.690 --> 00:58:50.519
They just started to walk.

00:58:50.519 --> 00:58:56.369
[pause] What happened next was amazing.

00:58:56.369 --> 00:59:04.509
In the words of David Bush, the Vietnam vet
that recounts this story, he said, "The fighting

00:59:04.509 --> 00:59:05.539
stopped.

00:59:05.539 --> 00:59:12.019
I couldn't understand why I'd want to shoot
at a person I didn't know."

00:59:12.019 --> 00:59:15.490
And I think that is the power of presence.

00:59:15.490 --> 00:59:20.369
Sometimes a leader's responsibility is not
to give elaborate speeches, it's just to be

00:59:20.369 --> 00:59:21.369
present.

00:59:21.369 --> 00:59:25.549
Thank you very much for your help.

00:59:25.549 --> 00:59:26.759
Cheers.

00:59:26.759 --> 00:59:27.969
[applause]
