00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.440
Welcome to level two
linear equations.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.330
Let's do a problem.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:14.130
2x plus 3 is equal to minus 15.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.260
Throw the minus in there to
make it a little bit tougher.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.970
So the first thing we
want to do whenever

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.850
we do any linear
equation, is we want

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.190
to get all of the
variable terms on one hand

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.180
side of the equation and
all the constant terms

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:25.930
on the other side.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.860
And it doesn't really
matter, although I

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.970
tend to get my variables on the
left hand side of the equation.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.530
Well, my variables are
already on the left hand

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.570
side of the equation
but I have this plus 3

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.020
that I somehow want to
move to the right hand

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.470
side of the equation.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.900
And the way I can-- you can put
it in quotes, move the 3 is I

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.080
can subtract 3 from both
sides of this equation.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.690
And look at that carefully as
to why you think that works.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.690
Because if I subtract 3
from the left hand side,

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.350
clearly this negative 3 that I'm
subtracting and the original 3

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.690
will cancel out and become 0.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.250
and as long as I do whatever
I do on the left hand side,

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.958
as long as I do it on
the right hand side

00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:07.526
as well, because whatever you do
on one side of the equal side,

00:01:07.526 --> 00:01:08.900
you have to do to
the other side,

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.130
then I'm making a
valid operation.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.600
So this will simplify to 2x,
because the 3's cancel out.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.200
They become just 0.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.320
Equals minus 15 minus 3.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.595
Well, that's minus 18.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.200
And now, we're just at
a level one problem,

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.840
and you can just
multiply both sides

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.630
of this equation
times the reciprocal

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:32.890
on the coefficient of 2x.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.274
I mean, some people
would just say

00:01:37.274 --> 00:01:39.190
that we're dividing by
2, which is essentially

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.140
what we're doing.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.020
I like to always go
with the reciprocal,

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.410
because if this
2 was a fraction,

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.270
it's easier to think
about it that way.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.250
But either way, you either
multiply by the reciprocal,

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.250
or divide by the number.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.580
It's the same thing.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.590
So 1/2 times 2x.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.930
Well, that's just 1x.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.780
So you get x equals,
and then minus 18/2.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.660
And minus 18/2, well,
that just equals minus 9.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.060
Let's do another problem.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.530
And actually, well, if we wanted
to check it, we could say,

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:17.070
well, the original problem
was 2x plus 3 equals minus 15.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.160
So we could say 2
times minus 9 plus 3.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.530
2 times minus 9 is
minus 18 plus 3.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.090
Well, that's equal
to minus 15, which

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.120
is equal to what the
original equation said,

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.120
so we know that's right.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.620
That's the neat
thing about algebra.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.279
You can always check your work.

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:36.320
Let's do another problem.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.560
I'm going to put some
fractions in this time,

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.360
just to show you that it
can get a little bit hairy.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:57.135
So let's say I had minus 1/2x
plus 3/4 is equal to 5/6.

00:02:57.135 --> 00:02:58.260
So we'll do the same thing.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.460
First, we just want to get
this 3/4 out of the left hand

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.846
side of the equation,
and actually,

00:03:03.846 --> 00:03:05.720
if you want to try
working this out yourself,

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.650
you might want to
pause the video

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.240
and then play it once you're
ready to see how I do it.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.360
Anyway, let me move forward
assuming you haven't paused it.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.730
If we want to get rid
of this 3/4, all we do

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.175
is we subtract 3/4 from
both sides of this equation.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.240
Minus 3/4.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.990
Well, the left hand side,
the two 3/4 will just cancel.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:33.640
We get minus 1/2x equals, and
then on the right hand side,

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.200
we just have to do this
fraction addition or fraction

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.880
subtraction.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.120
So the least common
multiple of 6 and 4 is 12.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:53.470
So this becomes 5/6 6 is
10/12 minus 3/4 is 9/12,

00:03:53.470 --> 00:04:01.900
so we get minus 1/2x
is equal to 1/12.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.190
Hopefully, I didn't make
a mistake over here.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.490
And if that step confused
you, I went a little fast,

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.156
you might just want
to review the adding

00:04:08.156 --> 00:04:10.009
and subtraction of fractions.

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:11.300
So going back to where we were.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.400
So now all we have to do
is, well, the coefficient

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.850
on the x term is minus 1/2,
and this is now a level one

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:17.490
problem.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.490
So to solve for x,
we just multiply

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:23.160
both sides by the reciprocal
of this minus 1/2x,

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:29.570
and that's minus 2/1 times
minus 1/2x on that side,

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.880
and then that's times minus 2/1.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.430
The left hand side, and
you're used to this by now,

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.180
simplifies to x.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.510
The right hand side
becomes minus 2/12,

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.160
and we could simplify
that further to minus 1/6.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:55.750
Well, let's check that just
to make sure we got it right.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.840
So let's try to
remember that minus 1/6.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.640
So the original
problem was minus 1/2x,

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.270
so here we can substitute
the minus 1/6, plus 3/4.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.150
I just wrote only the left hand
side of the original problem.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.640
So minus 1/2 times
minus 1/6, well, that's

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:23.150
positive 1/12 plus 3/4.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.730
Well, that's the
same thing as 12,

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.270
the 1 stays the same, plus 9.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.530
1 plus 9 is 10 over 12.

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.650
And that is equal
to 5/6, which is

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.020
what our original problem was.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.730
Our original problem was this.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:39.850
This stuff I wrote later.

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.150
So it's 5/6, so the
problem checks out.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.750
So hopefully, you're now
ready to try some level two

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.664
problems on your own.

00:05:48.664 --> 00:05:50.330
I might add some other
example problems.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:55.000
But the only extra step here
relative to level one problems

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.062
is you'll have this
constant term that you

00:05:58.062 --> 00:06:00.930
need to add or subtract from
both sides of this equation,

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.720
and you'll essentially turn
it into a level one problem.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.329
Have fun.
