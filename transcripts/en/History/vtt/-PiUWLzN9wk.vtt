00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.000
FRANK: Mark, what about the
Mobile Oil signs.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.030
One stand's been homemade.

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.330
You've got a rim on
the bottom of it.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.470
MARK: Yeah, model A rim.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:09.870
FRANK: What would you
have to have for them?

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.170
That one right there,
I'd want about 1,500.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.270
1,500?

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:14.870
What about-- what would
you do on the pair?

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.930
I mean, 15, I
think, is up there.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.370
MARK: Thing is they
got [inaudible] stuff--

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.230
you go to those flea
markets and stuff, probably,

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.670
like, 2,800 for both of them.
- 2,800?

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:24.800
Yeah.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.530
Uh, Dad, I don't
want to sell them.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:27.770
I gotta-- you
gotta leave a little.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.570
I was thinking 2,000 for both.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.870
We'll keep them for that.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:33.100
Frank wanted both.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.070
I go no way.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.000
Yeah.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.830
No.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.830
What's the best on
the one with the rim?

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.270
1,300.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.000
1,300, yeah-- let me
see the back of it here.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.400
JIMMY: I think we got
a base laying around,

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.630
an original base somewhere.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.170
The base is important.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.470
It's on a rim right now.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:52.900
That doesn't do it any justice.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.300
Well, if I pay 13 for this, how
much is the base if we find it?

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.670
Probably at least--

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:59.400
MARK: 150.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.670
150.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:01.970
That's what I was thinking--
FRANK: For the base?

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.170
--150 bucks more.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.930
I mean, because it's
the original base.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.070
It's somewhere in here.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.470
FRANK (VOICEOVER): If
I can find the base,

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.400
we can have the rim cut off,
have the pipe re-threaded,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.470
and then have it put
on the original stand.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.870
1,300, and you guys will
try to help me find the base.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.000
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.400
And we find the base,
it's good condition,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.400
a buck and a half.
- Right.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.470
- Yeah.
- All right.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.330
MARK: OK.
FRANK: Got a deal.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.600
MARK: All right.
All right now.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.600
FRANK: You got it.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.730
FRANK (VOICEOVER):
1,300 is up there.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:25.970
But I wanted to get
some money going.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.870
I wanted to get something
going with these people

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.000
so they know we're
serious on buying.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.200
Mike, when you're
crawling around,

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.300
you're looking for a
mobile cast iron base.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.930
All right, so there's
a base in here somewhere?

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:36.400
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.230
All right, what else
you got back here?

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:43.930
FRANK (VOICEOVER): So me
and Mike kind of separate.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:44.630
I go with Jimmy.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:45.670
He goes with Mark.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:46.730
How about this, Jimmy?

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.730
This battery charging station.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.030
He'd put the batteries on here.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.500
They'd be for sale.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.600
It's enamel.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.400
It's not porcelain or
anything like that.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.100
- No, I want to keep that one.
- You want to keep it?

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.770
All right.
- Yeah.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:57.900
I can understand.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.370
MIKE (VOICEOVER): The
last time we were here,

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.900
we didn't even deal with Jimmy.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:01.830
He was younger then.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.270
We were dealing
with the old man.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.270
Red crown?

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.870
- Not for sale.
- NFS?

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.170
JIMMY: Yes, sir.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.430
MIKE (VOICEOVER): So it's
kind of cool to watch Jimmy

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.930
and Frank try to make a deal.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:10.700
What about that?

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:11.970
"Pollution Control"?

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.200
JIMMY: Naw, I'll
probably keep that.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.170
FRANK: Keep that too?

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.970
JIMMY: Yeah, it
looks nice up there.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:15.800
I might need that.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.070
- You might need that?
- Yeah.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.700
FRANK: What about the
Firestone, would you sell that?

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.900
JIMMY: Mm-mm, no.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.130
FRANK: You know we gotta ask.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.470
JIMMY: Yep.
- That's a nice light.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.300
What about that light?

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.330
MARK: Yeah, will I sell that?

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.700
Let me see the end.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.170
It's off an old
lathe or something?

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.200
- Mm-hmm.
- What do you get for that?

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.730
Give me 30 bucks for it.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:33.970
All right, I'll do it.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.170
- All right.
- Have to rewire it.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.270
We'll work it out.
- Yeah.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.970
What about the Imperial
and the Cypress sign?

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.500
No, probably hang onto that.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.500
- Hang onto that one?
- Yeah.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.030
East Cypress.
FRANK: 300 bucks?

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.730
No.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:45.430
No?

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.630
I'll keep that.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:47.970
FRANK (VOICEOVER):
I'm starting to think

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.370
Jimmy's freezing me out.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.000
I bought a really cool Sunset
Boulevard street sign from Mark

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.470
last time we were here.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.300
But Jimmy won't even listen to
a price on street signs today.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.070
What about this sign,
would you sell that?

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.170
MARK: Yeah.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.330
MIKE (VOICEOVER):
This is a porcelain

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.330
speed limit sign that
has plastic reflectors

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.430
in the numbers.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.770
MIKE: Would you do 350 on this?

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:08.630
[ca-ching]

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.970
If this were older, it
would have glass reflectors.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.300
But let's face it.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.030
When it's up on the wall,
it's still going to look good.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.170
FRANK: Jimmy, what
about the Miller tires?

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.370
JIMMY: No, I'm keeping that.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.270
FRANK: How about the Texaco?

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.330
JIMMY: Nope.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.700
MIKE (VOICEOVER): I'm
dealing with Mark.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.970
And I'm hearing what's going
on with Frank around the room.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.630
FRANK: This is called a
Junior Harley-Davidson,

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:30.500
made by Hubley.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.400
JIMMY: No.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.570
FRANK: How about your Valvoline?

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:33.370
JIMMY: No.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.570
FRANK: How about the clock?

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:35.630
JIMMY: Na, I'll keep that.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:36.930
MIKE: I'm hearing
Frank ask about things.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.770
It's like, no, no, no, no.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.530
No, no, no, no, no.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.030
No no no.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.270
No.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.530
FRANK: Let's see where
your-- see where Pops is at.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:47.670
I mean, you just gotta--

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.030
you gotta keep trying.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.970
You gotta keep trying.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.100
Mark, what about this one?

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.130
There's not a lot
of color left on it.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.000
JIMMY: Not for sale.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.470
That's the only one we got.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.600
FRANK (VOICEOVER): Now, I
know I'm not being paranoid.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.930
I remember this exact sign
from the last time I was here.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.330
What do you get for
something like this?

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.800
MARK: 75 bucks.
FRANK: 75?

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:04.800
MARK: Yep.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.670
I'm just going to
keep looking here.

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.100
I'm going to keep--
- OK.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.070
FRANK (VOICEOVER): We
always say the time to buy

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.070
is when you see it.

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.570
And here's proof of that.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.930
But more importantly,
the time to buy it

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.600
is when you first
see it with Mark.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.170
FRANK: What about
the Shell clam shell

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.800
over here that's kind of rusty?
JIMMY: Nnnnope.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.000
FRANK: All right.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.030
Things were going great
when we first stopped in.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.530
And then, all of a
sudden, it shut down.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.970
I mean, it turned off
like a light switch.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.400
What do you got on
the Coca Cola sign?

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.570
JIMMY: No.

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:32.770
FRANK: Hey, what's
this now, guys?

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:33.800
What's this?

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.030
Here's the base right here!

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.600
JIMMY: There it is.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.600
And of all people, you found it.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.300
When Frank bought
that sign, I was

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.470
hoping he didn't find the base.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.200
- 150?
- We got it.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.530
All right.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.000
FRANK (VOICEOVER): All I need
to do is cut the rim off,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.400
have it threaded, put it on.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.530
It raises it by hundreds.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.530
All right, I'm excited.
