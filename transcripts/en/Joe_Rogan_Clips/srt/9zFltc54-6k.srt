1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,060
So now when you were doing stand up and
you started to get in some trouble for

2
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:11,700
bits, a lot of trouble. A
lot of trouble. Like how much
travel? Yeah, a lot of money.

3
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:14,890
I spent a lot of money.
Really as long as I lost a lot of sauces,

4
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:18,910
I lost a lot of lessons because
of jokes. Really. Lawsuits. Yeah.

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,040
So like who was suing you? Uh,
the people who fell offended.

6
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,270
So people in the audience,
artists when I make fun of a celebrity,

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,760
they would sue you. Yeah,
they can, they can sue you.

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,140
They can get money out of all the TV
shows. They can get up politicians.

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,790
So who sued you? You know,
I got this, uh, this last,

10
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:43,770
so they really, uh, put me in trouble.
It was because of a singer. It was,

11
00:00:43,771 --> 00:00:48,630
she was a singer and a kind of a
almost cute my career. He actually did,

12
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:52,820
that's why I'm here. So No, uh, yeah,

13
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:57,300
I got into a huge lawsuit and it
looks dumb when you explain, oh,

14
00:00:57,301 --> 00:00:58,230
it's just a singer.

15
00:00:58,231 --> 00:01:03,231
But he became all this talk about freedom
of speech and what comedians can say.

16
00:01:04,471 --> 00:01:08,520
And what they cannot say.
Are you allowed to feel a fandom?

17
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,850
And now there's like law schools talks
about the lawsuit that I had law school

18
00:01:15,661 --> 00:01:19,530
discussions, discussions out cause
okay. Yeah because I made fun.

19
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:24,780
He was a shitty joke. That's the problem.
You know, it's not because of the losses.

20
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,200
I want to be sued by the good ones
because I don't want to be known by a bad

21
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:33,840
joke. Right, right. Oh of course.
Yeah. It's just like I was saying,

22
00:01:33,841 --> 00:01:36,610
this will say it's just like you
were meeting, uh, Eddie Murphy,

23
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:40,700
one of the greatest comedians ever. They
think, oh, there's doctor Doolittle.

24
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,200
You don't want that right now.
This is the same thing with me.

25
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,880
That joke was a shitty joke.

26
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:49,910
And she was like bragging on TV and
she was like doing a story on TV.

27
00:01:51,331 --> 00:01:53,880
And I was the host of this huge TV show,

28
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,620
like the daily show and like the
daily show meeting, the view.

29
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,840
It was something like that.
And uh,

30
00:02:00,841 --> 00:02:04,140
and in the middle of the things she was
show us there and my friend asked me, oh,

31
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:07,380
she's pregnant. And do you think
she's still hot? And I said,

32
00:02:07,381 --> 00:02:10,650
she's so hot that I would
fuck her in her baby and

33
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,360
shit, but it was live. It
was like right on time.

34
00:02:15,361 --> 00:02:17,520
Everybody laughed and
there was no problem.

35
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,480
But next week there was this
huge thing because she was like,

36
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,680
her husband was very influential and uh,

37
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,620
her husband was managing run now do,

38
00:02:28,621 --> 00:02:32,760
which was one of the
biggest soccer player ever.

39
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,430
So there was this whole thing,
the TV show lost the sponsors and uh,

40
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:41,940
and they want to suspend me from the TV
show because the have a joke that I did.

41
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,950
She didn't tell,
they didn't tell me to apologize at first,

42
00:02:46,951 --> 00:02:51,090
but they suspended me. So I
quit the show. They didn't know.

43
00:02:51,091 --> 00:02:52,320
So you just apologize.

44
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:57,321
And I decided not to apologize because
I felt that after like 10 years,

45
00:02:57,631 --> 00:02:59,490
don't stand there or 12
years doing stand up.

46
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,730
It was important for me to like put my
feet on the ground and say, you know,

47
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,720
if we step back right now,
what am I,

48
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,080
what am I going to do in like a two years?

49
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:14,680
This is important for all of
us is important for comedy.

50
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,420
So I lost, lost tell us
movies a, so what did they,

51
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,390
what did they rule in the lawsuit?

52
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,690
Like what was the ruling I have friended
her on or honor or the ad was something

53
00:03:25,691 --> 00:03:29,950
like that. She's like, uh,
uh, they, people can sue you.

54
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:34,960
Just suing is part of the democracy.
It's okay to sue you. But to look,

55
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:37,180
to lose a lawsuit is,
that's the problem.

56
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,690
I lost like $150,000 or OTC,

57
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,690
but in Brazil was 350,000 high. So, right.

58
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,780
If you're a lawyer and you get $10,000
a month, you get 10,000 hours a month.

59
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:52,450
So He's, you don't translate
money. So I lost a lot of money,

60
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:57,300
but the thing has gotten me a
huge headache and uh, he was,

61
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:00,940
he was bad. It goes bad chest
from that one just for that one.

62
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,810
But you saw other lawsuit?
Yeah.

63
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:06,910
How also because I did it
like a rape joke and uh,

64
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,170
I got like this women
movement like trying to break,

65
00:04:11,171 --> 00:04:15,580
break into my bar and break my door
of my comedy club. And there was like,

66
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:16,970
that was a while.

67
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,950
But the discussion was more
important than the problem itself.

68
00:04:20,951 --> 00:04:25,951
I kind of thought it was the discussion
about freedom of speech and that was,

69
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,040
that was huge.
What is freedom of

70
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,150
speech like in Brazil?
Is it the same?

71
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:33,080
I mean obviously we have the first
amendment. You have the first summit.

72
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,670
Do you have something? We
don't, we don't have that.

73
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,710
They didn't have that in Canada.
We don't have that.

74
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,390
I had Mike Ward on and Canada. Do you
know his story? Yeah, I know he's the guy.

75
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,130
He made a joke about a sick boy.

76
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,580
The boy was still alive years later.
I thought it was.

77
00:04:47,581 --> 00:04:51,570
And you know it was just a bad joke about
this guy is still being alive and can

78
00:04:51,571 --> 00:04:54,620
he get his money back? Cause like,
cause they donated money. It's like,

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,100
it's fucked up joke,

80
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,940
but it's supposed to be a fucked up
joker who's doing it in a nightclub

81
00:04:59,941 --> 00:05:01,680
situation where people are drinking,

82
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,800
you say things that are inappropriate
and that's the art form.

83
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,490
He got sued and he's still in
the process of it right now.

84
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,370
There's another case in Vancouver
where these women were heckling, uh,

85
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:16,500
they were yelling things out during the
show and then the comedian went on stage

86
00:05:16,501 --> 00:05:20,470
and be rated the women and then
the women's sued and won because a,

87
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:24,210
they were lesbians and he made some
lesbian jokes about them at their own

88
00:05:24,211 --> 00:05:28,380
expense. And so then they took him to
court and they won and they won what?

89
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:32,850
They want some judgment where he had
to pay them. I want to change Jimmy.

90
00:05:32,851 --> 00:05:36,120
How much was it? I want to say it was
somewhere in the neighborhood of $30,000.

91
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,950
$30,000. Yeah. I went in and for
this gentleman, this comedian, uh,

92
00:05:40,951 --> 00:05:44,830
I think that was a lot of money.
I don't, 40 to 40. $2,000. Yeah,

93
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:48,240
that's a lot of fucking money
for opening comedian. I mean,

94
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:52,950
he wasn't a famous guy, so you know,
that might be two years worked for him.

95
00:05:52,951 --> 00:05:55,540
Who knows, you know, of course, of
course, yeah. Lost a lot of money.

96
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,120
Canada's similar count.

97
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,410
Canada does not have freedom of speech
the same way the United States does.

98
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,720
Yeah. The debt. That's why, uh,

99
00:06:03,721 --> 00:06:07,860
I feel what I do comedy here and I feel
that people get uncomfortable about a

100
00:06:07,861 --> 00:06:10,080
joke or two.
That's when I get stressed.

101
00:06:10,081 --> 00:06:13,380
It's like you have the feeder
of saying those things. Yes.

102
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,060
I have this joke that I say it is about
the n word as well. I might have it,

103
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,510
maybe I have to change my,

104
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:24,870
but I have this young that I do is like,
when I arrived here, someone said to me,

105
00:06:24,871 --> 00:06:27,360
you don't use the n word or
people are gonna kick her ass.

106
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:32,070
But they never told me what the n
word was. So for the past six months,

107
00:06:32,071 --> 00:06:34,300
I have been avoiding all
wars with the leather.

108
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,490
And the other day a guy came up to
me and said, can I fuck your ass?

109
00:06:38,491 --> 00:06:42,640
And I was like, mm. Maybe in a,

110
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:46,530
when I say this job is
like I have to set up,

111
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:51,270
it's crazy because when I first did,
he was like a fucking thing.

112
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:52,650
Everybody got uncomfortable.

113
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,520
But now I set up as a misunderstanding
because I'm a foreigner and now I'm free

114
00:06:59,491 --> 00:07:04,020
to do everything. Yes, yes. Yeah.
So I kind of, I found the way

115
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:09,900
you found a way in. Yeah.
So that's, it's crazy.

116
00:07:09,901 --> 00:07:14,220
And I watch you alive and I see a lot
of people here. I saw the other guy,

117
00:07:14,221 --> 00:07:15,054
this guy,

118
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:20,090
this guy did an interview with you and
he did this show in a college and he did

119
00:07:20,851 --> 00:07:25,380
a joke and people took him out of
State Mesh. Nimesh Patel. Yeah. Yeah.

120
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:29,040
That's crazy. Because you built
the freedom to do that. Yes.

121
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,130
And now you're discussing the,

122
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:36,200
if you can or you cannot solely in
colleges though in children today,

123
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,560
and I'm going to call them children,

124
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:44,080
they do not understand the danger
in suppressing free speech.

125
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:49,450
And so they think that what they're
doing is by suppressing free speech and

126
00:07:49,451 --> 00:07:51,250
changing the way people communicate.

127
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,190
What they're doing is making
the world a better place.

128
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,490
They think they're signaling the virtue
and making the world a better place at

129
00:07:57,491 --> 00:08:00,970
the same time. But it's just ignorance.
They just don't understand that you can't,

130
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,880
you can't necessarily,
you can't control people.

131
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,740
And to think that by just getting upset
and silencing someone on removing them

132
00:08:08,741 --> 00:08:11,110
from the stage at that ends
the conversation. It doesn't,

133
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,110
it reinforces their position.
It says, okay, look,

134
00:08:14,111 --> 00:08:18,220
I was right about you fucking snowflakes
and you little babies like you,

135
00:08:18,221 --> 00:08:21,190
you can't even understand when things
are uncomfortable that it doesn't

136
00:08:21,191 --> 00:08:24,890
necessarily mean it's negative.
And that like you're like x,

137
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,190
try to put yourself in someone's position.
See what he's saying.

138
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:30,970
And in the meshes this case, it's
actually kinda funny, first of all,

139
00:08:30,971 --> 00:08:34,820
he's very open minded guy,
very progressive. He's,

140
00:08:34,821 --> 00:08:37,390
he's not in any way a racist.

141
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:42,420
And his joke was that people
say that being gay is a choice.

142
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:46,630
And he said, I know it's not a choice
cause I have a friend who's black and gay.

143
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:51,430
There's no way he would choose both of
those things. And it was just double up.

144
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:55,500
It was just him being funny. It's a
funny joke. And they were like, cut,

145
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:59,730
get the fuck off the stage. Like what?
Come on man. You don't think that's funny.

146
00:08:59,731 --> 00:09:00,140
That's crazy.

147
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,540
I mean and it's also coming from an
Indian man who I'm sure is experienced

148
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,730
racism.
So though the whole thing is,

149
00:09:05,731 --> 00:09:10,731
it's very fascinating to see young kids
who are growing up in this PC culture

150
00:09:11,611 --> 00:09:12,600
bubble and you know,

151
00:09:12,601 --> 00:09:15,510
and sometimes people say on this podcast
that we talk about it too much and

152
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:16,530
maybe their correct.

153
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:19,650
Maybe sometimes it's annoying if you're
listening to your cubicle and you hear

154
00:09:19,651 --> 00:09:20,910
me talking too much about this,

155
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,920
but it's because it's an issue
that's very dear to my heart.

156
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:30,660
Cause I understand the dangers of
not being able to communicate freely.

157
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:35,130
And I also stay understand what happens
when if you suppress free communication,

158
00:09:35,131 --> 00:09:36,510
the people that you're suppressing,

159
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:41,070
they're going to get more and more angry
and radical and it just makes their

160
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:42,060
position, they're, they, they,

161
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:47,110
they feel more justified in there in
perhaps even people who are racist could

162
00:09:47,401 --> 00:09:52,170
perhaps be more racist or people who are
angry about gay people will become more

163
00:09:52,171 --> 00:09:54,900
angry about it if you suppress
their ability to express himself.

164
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:58,740
That's when borns, those little movements
and Neil Nasi movements, little groups,

165
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,370
little groups on the web, in the deep
web when discussion, it's like when you,

166
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:06,210
for when it's for beating I think is
that you can forgive them the power that

167
00:10:06,211 --> 00:10:07,920
they didn't have.
I think so.

168
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:11,280
And I think this is something that we
really just getting to understand now.

169
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,091
You know,
I have,

170
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:15,930
I've had a few conversations about this
recently with the head of Twitter and

171
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:20,140
with the an independent journalist Tim
pool last week and I think what people

172
00:10:20,141 --> 00:10:21,900
were just started to kind of understand,

173
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:23,280
even though everyone's
uncomfortable about this,

174
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:26,130
is we're still trying to figure this out.

175
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,250
Social media is only 10 plus years old.

176
00:10:29,251 --> 00:10:32,580
This is an incredibly new experience
for us and I don't think everybody knows

177
00:10:32,581 --> 00:10:33,690
exactly how to proceed.

178
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,410
And this idea that you could just band
people and they just banned people for

179
00:10:37,411 --> 00:10:39,540
life. If they say something
that makes people uncomfortable,

180
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:42,580
if they say an opinion you don't agree
with, banned them for life. And we're,

181
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,560
we're experiencing that right now.
And uh,

182
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,690
we're trying to figure
out what to do and how to,

183
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,290
how to fix this and how to mitigate
it without endorsing people,

184
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:55,200
harassing people and divorcing
people, uh, you know,

185
00:10:55,201 --> 00:10:57,930
threatening people and giving out their
address and their phone number and

186
00:10:57,931 --> 00:11:01,800
things along those lines. But
it's a process that we're,
we're all going through,

187
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:06,060
right? It is a learning process for
the, the, the, the whole country.

188
00:11:06,061 --> 00:11:07,250
But the thing that a,

189
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:11,370
a noise annoys me a little bit is that I,

190
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I leave it in another country and I see
how things are difficult and how much

191
00:11:17,251 --> 00:11:21,830
time I spent explaining to people
what I was doing. And for you guys,

192
00:11:21,831 --> 00:11:25,740
it's like I was having the same problems
that Lenny Bruce was having like a long

193
00:11:25,741 --> 00:11:29,660
time ago. Yes. And a, you
guys built that. Yeah.

194
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,020
To have that discussion.

195
00:11:31,021 --> 00:11:35,460
It's like it is important because
that's the way the war uh,

196
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,970
evolved.
But at the same time he feels old.

197
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:42,690
It feels old because you understand
the history of it in America. Yeah.

198
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,330
It feels old because you already had that
discussion a long time ago. Yeah. Yeah.

199
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:51,720
You kinda keep having this conversation
when you think that you'll finally feel

200
00:11:51,721 --> 00:11:55,450
free to say whatever you want now
there's people trying to hold you back.

201
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:59,890
It's crazy. Well, it's not
really effective. See there's,

202
00:11:59,891 --> 00:12:03,820
there's people that are angry about it.
I mean there is on social media,

203
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:06,790
there's certainly people that
are being effective with it.

204
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,270
But in stand up comedy,
it's this,

205
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:14,200
there's blow back and push back.
But it's not very effective.

206
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:18,820
Like for the top guys, for guys like Dave
Chappelle and you know, Bill Burr, it's,

207
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:22,690
it actually makes their stand up better
because people are so tired of all this

208
00:12:22,691 --> 00:12:25,120
shit.
They're so tired of PC culture.

209
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:29,230
They're so tired of being told what they
should and shouldn't think is funny and

210
00:12:29,231 --> 00:12:32,380
what is acceptable and not
acceptable. And you know, there's a,

211
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:34,660
there's a lot of weird
shit going on right now.
