00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.440
Drones are everywhere!

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:06.490
They're used in television, movies, toys,
military, construction, sports, manufacturing,

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:07.490
and more.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:18.540
And the newest technology is even more advanced
than you know.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.821
The official name for the remote controlled
"drones" we know and love/hate is UAVs or

00:00:23.821 --> 00:00:29.730
unmanned aerial vehicles, though the military
calls them Unmanned Aerial Systems or UASs.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.440
The word "drone" implies something which operates
on its own, though most military drones or

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.109
UAVs are simply remote controlled -- but for
the sake of simplicity we'll call them drones

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:40.109
anyway…

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:45.570
The first weaponized drone was flown in 1994
-- the Predator MQ-1; but advances in the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.659
last 20 years have been incredible.

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:54.480
Take, for example, the largest drone around
today: a 757-sized UAV called Triton operated

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.729
by the U.S. Navy.

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:01.819
Its 130-foot wingspan and fuel efficiency
allows it to fly 2,000 nautical miles in a

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:07.800
mission, identify ships, de-ice its wings,
and navigate turbulence -- ALL without human

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.800
interaction.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.320
The thing can even be struck by lightning
and still operate.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.580
Most flying drones operate for 20 hours and
are pre-programmed to fly to a specific area

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.610
and look around, or piloted to a mission by
a person in a ground station.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.700
The military controls these giant aircraft
from hundreds of miles away via satellite

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.110
communications, GPS and the aircraft's onboard
computers.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.840
This combination of ground and space-based
systems can affect how long information takes

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:38.970
to get to the pilot -- Predators took a long
as five minutes to get detailed information,

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:46.230
making the UAV system extra important, but
today, the newest drones can provide 360 degree

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.210
video, infrared, and radar data: all live.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.590
Most UASs include line-of-site control for
take-off and landing, and satellite control

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.670
during long flights and missions which would
go out of range of a tower or antenna.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.290
Obviously direct control is faster, satellites
have a 1-second delay... but if somehow the

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.509
signal is lost from the human pilot, the drone
can be programmed to fly in circles, or return

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:11.540
to its take-off point.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.070
It can even land on its own if it has to.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.260
Drones aren't only airborne.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.660
The drone boat is a true autonomous and artificially
intelligent helper boat.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.090
These drone boats are programmed to swarm
targets without human instruction -- they

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.870
can network with each other, and though they're
unarmed, are supposed to isolate a craft or

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.270
intercept enemy fire without putting people
in harms way.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.310
Another naval drone uses biomimicry technology
to look like sharks or fish!

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:43.550
These drones can operate in 10 inches of water
or dive to 300 feet either tethered to a ship,

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.500
or autonomously; only surfacing to communicate.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.510
They're unarmed, but key for intelligence
gathering.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.270
The future of drones is getting crazy.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.080
Virtual Reality is coming, where pilots can
"look" through cameras and pilot aircraft

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.730
or boats like a video game.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.370
It's already come to commercial drones used
for Star Wars pod-racing-style games.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.880
But the U.S. Air Force is pulling out all
the stops with their "secret" space shuttle.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.970
The X-37B launched in 2012 and orbited the
earth for 500 days autonomously, returning

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.990
and landing on its own in 2014.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.830
No one knows what it's for… but it's technically
a drone.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:28.000
And people allegedly spotted Northrop-Grumman's
flying wings over texas, a type of aircraft

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.569
rumored for a long while, even tested by NASA,
but still classified, if it exists at all.

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.890
Drones have advanced so much in 20 years…
will another 20 have them delivering pizzas,

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.800
filming football games, going to asteroids
and flying us around the globe.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.510
Who knows, but one things for sure, they're
here to stay.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.050
There is something that could dampen drones
in our time, if the people put their foot

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.599
down and stop their use in the military, but
it doesn't seem like that's going to happen.

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:00.260
For more check out TestTube for the Pros and
Cons of Drones in War here.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:07.700
That being said, drones are machines, they're
not just for attacking, plenty of drones are

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.280
used for good!

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.660
Seeker has a whole episode about how drones
are making the world a better place.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:19.640
Which you can see here!
