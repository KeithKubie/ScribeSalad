00:00:09.612 --> 00:00:14.298
- [Narrator] We are the
paradoxical ape bipedal naked,

00:00:14.298 --> 00:00:15.465
large-brained,

00:00:17.106 --> 00:00:20.689
long the master of fire
tools and language.

00:00:21.525 --> 00:00:24.942
But still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:26.135 --> 00:00:29.244
Aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:29.244 --> 00:00:31.327
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.564 --> 00:00:35.981
we grow up slowly we hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:39.772
we empathize and deceive.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.728
We shape the future from
our shared understanding

00:00:43.728 --> 00:00:44.728
of the past.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.044
Carta brings together experts
from diverse disciplines.

00:00:50.044 --> 00:00:51.263
to exchange insights

00:00:51.263 --> 00:00:54.096
on who we are and how we got here.

00:00:56.385 --> 00:00:58.090
An exploration made possible by the

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.923
generosity of humans like you you.

00:01:35.016 --> 00:01:38.595
- Well you all remembered
to come here today,

00:01:38.595 --> 00:01:40.956
and you all remembered how to get here,

00:01:40.956 --> 00:01:42.512
and you all have plans for what you're

00:01:42.512 --> 00:01:45.317
going to do after this meeting is over

00:01:45.317 --> 00:01:46.913
later today because that's what it's

00:01:46.913 --> 00:01:50.287
all about our world is the world of

00:01:50.287 --> 00:01:53.586
memories and we are our memories.

00:01:53.586 --> 00:01:55.806
That we think about memory
often about the past

00:01:55.806 --> 00:01:58.098
but memory is really about the future

00:01:58.098 --> 00:02:00.439
because it enables us to use information

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.715
that you gained in order to get along in

00:02:02.715 --> 00:02:03.548
life and that's what it's all about.

00:02:03.548 --> 00:02:06.964
Well I'm going to talk
about some people for

00:02:06.964 --> 00:02:10.940
whom the future is not terribly
important but the past is

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.455
awfully important.

00:02:12.455 --> 00:02:16.288
Unusual people indeed
there is the question of

00:02:17.194 --> 00:02:20.597
the very famous psychologist
maybe the founder of modern

00:02:20.597 --> 00:02:23.284
psychology William James instead of some

00:02:23.284 --> 00:02:25.482
experiences no memory survives the

00:02:25.482 --> 00:02:27.364
instance of their passage of others.

00:02:27.364 --> 00:02:30.017
It is confined to a few moments hours or

00:02:30.017 --> 00:02:31.298
days others may be recalled as long as

00:02:31.298 --> 00:02:34.688
life endures can we explain these

00:02:34.688 --> 00:02:35.521
differences?

00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:36.949
Why is it that that you can

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:40.116
remember right now exactly what I said

00:02:42.324 --> 00:02:44.001
even with the intonation you could mimic

00:02:44.001 --> 00:02:46.986
me and tomorrow you're going to remember

00:02:46.986 --> 00:02:48.750
that there was a meeting that you came

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.377
to and you're gonna remember a few

00:02:51.377 --> 00:02:54.710
elements well I'm gonna do it's not like

00:02:55.651 --> 00:02:58.138
that for all people.

00:02:58.138 --> 00:03:02.534
There was a man named Daniel
McCartney about whom an

00:03:02.534 --> 00:03:04.270
article was published in the Journal of

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.657
speculative philosophy.

00:03:06.657 --> 00:03:08.482
Dobby probably subscribed to that journal.

00:03:08.482 --> 00:03:11.478
Journal of speculative philosophy
which I had never heard of

00:03:11.478 --> 00:03:14.895
until somebody drew my attention to this,

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:20.286
who was tested in 1870 by a
man who discovered that this

00:03:23.248 --> 00:03:26.077
individual claimed that he
had a very strong memory

00:03:26.077 --> 00:03:27.973
of his personal experiences.

00:03:27.973 --> 00:03:32.436
So when he was 54 years
old in 1870 he was asked a

00:03:32.436 --> 00:03:35.221
lot of questions about his life going

00:03:35.221 --> 00:03:37.579
back many many years back actually to

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:41.325
the age of 4 years old and he responded

00:03:41.325 --> 00:03:43.292
in every case to the questions in two or

00:03:43.292 --> 00:03:46.779
three seconds maybe the test was

00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:49.612
repeated several days later and he

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.169
responded with the same answers but not

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:56.716
using the same words that is he knew

00:03:56.716 --> 00:03:59.154
what it would he could remember but he'd

00:03:59.154 --> 00:04:00.279
use different words to say it.

00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:03.362
So what happened on October 8th 1828.

00:04:04.517 --> 00:04:07.126
Wednesday was cloudy
and drizzling and rain I

00:04:07.126 --> 00:04:09.439
carried dinner to my father where he was

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:11.282
getting out coal.

00:04:11.282 --> 00:04:13.115
I was 42 years ago let

00:04:14.374 --> 00:04:18.460
4:13me run down let's
take April 4th 1841 he

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.366
4:18answered in 3 seconds
it was a Sunday it

00:04:20.366 --> 00:04:22.501
4:20was rainy and muddy general Harrison

00:04:22.501 --> 00:04:24.001
4:22died that day.

00:04:26.803 --> 00:04:28.275
February 2nd 1856 two second response.

00:04:28.275 --> 00:04:29.903
Saturday was most awful cold it

00:04:29.903 --> 00:04:32.333
was a coldest day ever see in my life

00:04:32.333 --> 00:04:34.430
records for Iowa February 4th indicated

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.660
the coldest day in 1856 now that's the

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.152
the bottom that's my interrogation

00:04:41.152 --> 00:04:43.960
because all of these are claims that

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.083
people make and you could make them up

00:04:46.083 --> 00:04:49.416
you know what did you do in June 12 1993

00:04:50.967 --> 00:04:53.102
and you go oh I went shopping that day I

00:04:53.102 --> 00:04:54.803
had a fight with my boyfriend or

00:04:54.803 --> 00:04:56.377
whatever I wouldn't know whether that's

00:04:56.377 --> 00:04:57.210
true or not so to my the limited ability

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.760
that I had I looked up the records for

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.677
things that he said when he said it

00:05:04.708 --> 00:05:06.482
snowed it rained

00:05:06.482 --> 00:05:08.957
on the day that he said it was a heavy

00:05:08.957 --> 00:05:11.675
snow that was a heaviest day of snowing

00:05:11.675 --> 00:05:14.013
in Iowa that year on the day that it

00:05:14.013 --> 00:05:15.589
rained it was within two days of the

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:17.976
date that he gave so to the extent that

00:05:17.976 --> 00:05:21.490
we can validate these claims they

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.263
appeared to be accurate he appears to

00:05:24.263 --> 00:05:26.252
have a phenomenal memory of his personal

00:05:26.252 --> 00:05:27.085
experiences but not a lot is known about

00:05:27.085 --> 00:05:29.751
him I'm just reporting what was reported

00:05:29.751 --> 00:05:32.834
and that rather obscure journal now I

00:05:33.782 --> 00:05:36.965
didn't know anything about him I had

00:05:36.965 --> 00:05:39.267
never read that article as a matter of

00:05:39.267 --> 00:05:41.324
fact our article was sent to me by a

00:05:41.324 --> 00:05:44.376
wag who after we started
publishing out work on highy

00:05:44.376 --> 00:05:47.085
superior autobiographical
memory said essentially

00:05:47.085 --> 00:05:49.194
he said yeah yeah yeah you didn't know

00:05:49.194 --> 00:05:51.071
about this for now and he sent me the

00:05:51.071 --> 00:05:52.906
article from this journal that I do not

00:05:52.906 --> 00:05:57.073
subscribe to and I haven't I
haven't found it on PubMed.

00:05:59.884 --> 00:06:04.051
So in 2000 a young woman a
32 year old named Jill price,

00:06:05.093 --> 00:06:08.403
sent me an email and said she had a

00:06:08.403 --> 00:06:10.959
memory problem and would like to meet me.

00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:12.624
Well I wrote back to her and said this

00:06:12.624 --> 00:06:14.775
is a Research Institute not a clinic but

00:06:14.775 --> 00:06:16.269
I can direct you to it.

00:06:16.269 --> 00:06:18.031
Well would you think when
somebody said I have a memory

00:06:18.031 --> 00:06:19.531
problem all right.

00:06:20.371 --> 00:06:22.530
Well she said oh no no that's not sir my

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.716
memory problem is that I don't forget.

00:06:25.716 --> 00:06:28.820
So I decided to meet with her I,

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.627
I really thought that it
wasn't that she probably

00:06:31.627 --> 00:06:33.670
didn't I really did think this was a

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:34.602
very strange behavior but I agreed to

00:06:34.602 --> 00:06:36.185
meet with her and I

00:06:38.825 --> 00:06:40.599
when she came since

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:43.117
we have never seen anybody
like they were tested.

00:06:43.117 --> 00:06:44.250
I didn't know what to do.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:46.861
So I had been given for Christmas this is

00:06:46.861 --> 00:06:49.622
2000 and I had been given a coffee table

00:06:49.622 --> 00:06:52.554
book which is about this thick which is

00:06:52.554 --> 00:06:56.157
newspaper reports for every day in the

00:06:56.157 --> 00:06:58.062
last century.

00:06:58.062 --> 00:06:59.492
You may have seen them they

00:06:59.492 --> 00:07:01.375
were around in that time.

00:07:01.375 --> 00:07:04.399
And so all I did was open that
book and ask her questions.

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:08.566
I turned to a page and which
was after the age of 13 because

00:07:09.778 --> 00:07:11.778
she said that's when
she began to have this

00:07:11.778 --> 00:07:16.564
ability and I question her
and these are the kinds of

00:07:16.564 --> 00:07:19.000
things that I asked.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:19.911
I ask about an event.

00:07:19.911 --> 00:07:23.564
I said when was there a
major San Diego plane crash?

00:07:23.564 --> 00:07:25.509
How many of you remember
the plane crash in

00:07:25.509 --> 00:07:27.176
September 25th 1978?

00:07:28.515 --> 00:07:30.155
How many of you would have
remembered the date if I

00:07:30.155 --> 00:07:31.754
hadn't said that?

00:07:31.754 --> 00:07:34.838
All right when did the
person Gulf War start?

00:07:34.838 --> 00:07:37.813
Wednesday January 16 891 and so on down

00:07:37.813 --> 00:07:39.064
the line.

00:07:39.064 --> 00:07:40.621
The one at the bottom I want to

00:07:40.621 --> 00:07:42.566
draw your attention to I asked her when

00:07:42.566 --> 00:07:44.285
was the Iranian invasion of the U.S.

00:07:44.285 --> 00:07:47.702
embassy and she said November 4th in 1979

00:07:50.907 --> 00:07:53.195
and I was looking at the
article right in front of me,

00:07:53.195 --> 00:07:55.823
and I said well you have it
pretty close you're several days

00:07:55.823 --> 00:07:57.684
off and she said no no no that this is

00:07:57.684 --> 00:08:01.187
the date and this was written here right

00:08:01.187 --> 00:08:05.287
in the book and she said
well the book is wrong.

00:08:05.287 --> 00:08:08.224
Well it turns out that I was
looking at the date of the

00:08:08.224 --> 00:08:10.681
article that was written
and down in the body of the

00:08:10.681 --> 00:08:13.598
article was the true the valid time

00:08:14.603 --> 00:08:16.997
which is November 4th 1979.

00:08:16.997 --> 00:08:19.448
But it was her assurance
that was important that

00:08:19.448 --> 00:08:21.100
the book was wrong.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:22.850
She said now we also.

00:08:23.897 --> 00:08:26.314
I also asked her about dates.

00:08:27.703 --> 00:08:29.819
I gave her a date and
she had to tell me what

00:08:29.819 --> 00:08:31.312
happened on that date.

00:08:31.312 --> 00:08:33.729
So August 16 1977 Elvis died,

00:08:36.009 --> 00:08:39.842
Let's go down November
4th 1979 and Ray that's

00:08:41.014 --> 00:08:44.394
right the Iranian invasion
of any US embassy.

00:08:44.394 --> 00:08:48.144
October 5th 1983 bombing
in Beirut Northridge

00:08:49.706 --> 00:08:52.754
earthquake and Lockerbie plane crash and

00:08:52.754 --> 00:08:55.114
so these are all accurate.

00:08:55.114 --> 00:08:56.975
These are her responses and I'm looking

00:08:56.975 --> 00:09:00.323
at the book so I knew the the answers

00:09:00.323 --> 00:09:03.465
but I knew them because
I was looking at them.

00:09:03.465 --> 00:09:05.632
Now we we can't take these

00:09:08.915 --> 00:09:11.524
statements as valid as a

00:09:11.524 --> 00:09:13.479
matter of fact she says that she remembers

00:09:13.479 --> 00:09:16.952
being in a crib when she was an infant.

00:09:16.952 --> 00:09:19.706
Well I'm not going to
accept that we have no

00:09:19.706 --> 00:09:22.297
way of validating and besides that,

00:09:22.297 --> 00:09:25.768
plenty of people see videos
of themselves and cribs or

00:09:25.768 --> 00:09:28.856
pictures of themselves and so that's not

00:09:28.856 --> 00:09:29.846
going to do the job.

00:09:29.846 --> 00:09:31.685
We have to validate it.

00:09:31.685 --> 00:09:35.129
So fortunately in her case she kept a

00:09:35.129 --> 00:09:38.666
diary for many years of her life and

00:09:38.666 --> 00:09:41.457
whoever she made a claim we were able to

00:09:41.457 --> 00:09:43.625
untie a little pink ribbon it was tied

00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:46.037
around this little book that she had and

00:09:46.037 --> 00:09:48.592
lots of books a stack like that open it

00:09:48.592 --> 00:09:51.491
up and see of what she said about it

00:09:51.491 --> 00:09:54.142
was accurate at one time we asked her to

00:09:54.142 --> 00:09:57.892
give us the the dates
of the last 20 Easters.

00:10:01.972 --> 00:10:04.722
How many of you remember the date

00:10:06.013 --> 00:10:08.400
of the last Easter as she told us the

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.150
the date of the last 20 Easter's.

00:10:12.163 --> 00:10:14.932
She also told us without
asking what she did

00:10:14.932 --> 00:10:17.625
on each of those dates and we could

00:10:17.625 --> 00:10:19.756
check that out because we're able to

00:10:19.756 --> 00:10:21.684
peek into her Diaries and validate some

00:10:21.684 --> 00:10:23.351
of that information.

00:10:25.223 --> 00:10:29.101
Now I'm going to show you
some other subjects let me I

00:10:29.101 --> 00:10:31.148
have to say that we we got a little

00:10:31.148 --> 00:10:35.017
publicity inadvertently sort of we went

00:10:35.017 --> 00:10:38.015
on NPR disguised her name had but talked

00:10:38.015 --> 00:10:40.270
about this a little bit
and then a little bit

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:41.770
of newspaper of publicity.

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:44.486
So we began to get subjects and

00:10:44.486 --> 00:10:46.986
by the time 2010 rolled around

00:10:50.222 --> 00:10:51.972
we had five subjects.

00:10:52.806 --> 00:10:56.973
Now they were filmed by 60
Minutes on December 19 2010

00:11:00.479 --> 00:11:01.979
That was a Sunday.

00:11:08.522 --> 00:11:10.879
It's help it's helpful that 60 minutes is

00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:13.894
always on a Sunday that's best to look

00:11:13.894 --> 00:11:17.473
look I did I did well go on
I don't I don't want to show

00:11:17.473 --> 00:11:21.385
off anymore so I'm going to show you a

00:11:21.385 --> 00:11:24.552
clips from TV programs in which we had

00:11:26.957 --> 00:11:30.475
this the first one is Louise Owen who is

00:11:30.475 --> 00:11:33.227
a professional violinist in New York a

00:11:33.227 --> 00:11:36.253
very high level violinist appears

00:11:36.253 --> 00:11:39.586
frequently both in groups and also solos

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:43.802
and and it's a really very charming

00:11:43.802 --> 00:11:45.985
person so I'll show you her first.

00:11:45.985 --> 00:11:47.832
- [Announcer] McGaugh
says this type of memory,

00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:50.087
is completely new to science.

00:11:50.087 --> 00:11:51.998
so he and his colleagues
have had to devise,

00:11:51.998 --> 00:11:55.739
their own tests like this
one on public events.

00:11:55.739 --> 00:11:59.120
- [Woman] October 19 1987 it's a Monday,

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.169
that was the day the
big stock market crash,

00:12:01.169 --> 00:12:03.866
and the cellist Jacqueline
Duprey died that day.

00:12:03.866 --> 00:12:04.699
- The Berlin Wall falls on what day?

00:12:04.699 --> 00:12:08.116
- November 9th 1989 which was a Thursday,

00:12:09.821 --> 00:12:12.575
- Christopher Reeves accident
occurred on what day?

00:12:12.575 --> 00:12:15.242
- It was Saturday May 27th 1995,

00:12:16.906 --> 00:12:20.242
- And when were the Oscars held in 1999

00:12:20.242 --> 00:12:22.492
in 1999, Sunday March 21st.

00:12:23.611 --> 00:12:25.146
- yes perfect.

00:12:25.146 --> 00:12:26.572
- Note that she didn't
say give me a moment.

00:12:26.572 --> 00:12:28.239
I'll think about it.

00:12:31.056 --> 00:12:33.933
She describes it as a google search and

00:12:33.933 --> 00:12:36.438
when she talks about it
she uses expressions.

00:12:36.438 --> 00:12:37.904
She says it's just there it just

00:12:37.904 --> 00:12:41.548
comes up like that and you can see.

00:12:41.548 --> 00:12:44.291
The ease with which she did
it the smile on her face

00:12:44.291 --> 00:12:45.886
and the speed of response.

00:12:45.886 --> 00:12:50.053
Responding within a second
or two it's right there.

00:12:51.007 --> 00:12:54.007
Let's move back in time now to 1990.

00:12:55.611 --> 00:12:58.617
It rained on several days
in January and February.

00:12:58.617 --> 00:13:02.117
Can you name the dates on which it rained.

00:13:03.681 --> 00:13:06.362
- [Announcer] Believe it or not she could.

00:13:06.362 --> 00:13:10.529
- Let's see it was slightly
rainy and cloudy on January 14,

00:13:11.466 --> 00:13:13.216
15th it was very hot.

00:13:14.267 --> 00:13:17.385
The weekend of the 27th or 28th no rain.

00:13:17.385 --> 00:13:20.330
- [Announcer] We checked the
official weather records,

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:23.688
- It rained very hard
on Sunday February 4th

00:13:23.688 --> 00:13:26.799
- [Announcer] and she was right

00:13:26.799 --> 00:13:29.458
- All right that was 20 years ago.

00:13:29.458 --> 00:13:32.172
From the time that I
asked her I was asking her

00:13:32.172 --> 00:13:34.412
when did it rain in New
York City 20 years ago.

00:13:34.412 --> 00:13:37.787
In January February and
she nailed every day.

00:13:37.787 --> 00:13:40.388
Now this is important
because for many of the other

00:13:40.388 --> 00:13:43.798
examples that I've shown
people could memorize,

00:13:43.798 --> 00:13:45.411
that is if you set your mind to it,

00:13:45.411 --> 00:13:47.785
you could memorize thing and
you spend all of your time

00:13:47.785 --> 00:13:50.178
memorizing experiences
like learning a list of

00:13:50.178 --> 00:13:51.673
words or whatever.

00:13:51.673 --> 00:13:56.082
I suppose I chose this example
because it's highly unlikely

00:13:56.082 --> 00:13:58.831
unless you want to challenge
me on this that she sat around

00:13:58.831 --> 00:14:02.070
for 20 years saying I must
remember the days in which it

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:05.320
rained in New York on those two months.

00:14:07.653 --> 00:14:12.092
Now we have also by luck found
several children who have

00:14:12.092 --> 00:14:15.175
this ability and this is
important also because of the

00:14:15.175 --> 00:14:19.102
possible interpretation that
these people have the ability

00:14:19.102 --> 00:14:21.107
because they spend a lot of time,

00:14:21.107 --> 00:14:23.012
rehearsing rehearsing rehearsing.

00:14:23.012 --> 00:14:25.871
Children don't have much time to do that.

00:14:25.871 --> 00:14:29.602
So I'm going to show you a
couple of fairly young children

00:14:29.602 --> 00:14:33.769
who have ability which is
just as good as our adults.

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:37.507
- [Announcer] Osler age 10.

00:14:37.507 --> 00:14:41.060
what day of the week was Halloween 2011?

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:44.498
- Monday that one I didn't
even have to think about.

00:14:44.498 --> 00:14:45.331
- New Year's Day 2010

00:14:45.331 --> 00:14:46.164
- Friday.

00:14:46.164 --> 00:14:50.331
I remember that 'cause I was
up all night and balloons came.

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:54.943
- [Announcer] That's when Jake was 6.

00:14:54.943 --> 00:14:57.564
He lives in st.Louis, loves sports

00:14:57.564 --> 00:15:00.911
and he is in most respects
a typical ten year old.

00:15:00.911 --> 00:15:05.078
- What happened related to
school on January 30th 2013.

00:15:06.414 --> 00:15:10.581
- That day I'm pretty sure
that's a trick question.

00:15:12.395 --> 00:15:16.082
Yeah we didn't have school that day.

00:15:16.082 --> 00:15:19.230
You know we had a
lightning storm last night.

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:22.230
Yeah we didn't have school that day.

00:15:26.404 --> 00:15:30.429
- [Man] 7th 2012 do you know
what day of the week that was?

00:15:30.429 --> 00:15:31.769
- That was a Sunday.

00:15:31.769 --> 00:15:32.852
- [Man] you're right.

00:15:32.852 --> 00:15:35.171
- [Announcer] There is
exactly one child in the world

00:15:35.171 --> 00:15:37.379
other than Jake who's been identified so

00:15:37.379 --> 00:15:39.497
far with this ability.

00:15:39.497 --> 00:15:42.280
11 year old Tyler Hickenbottom,

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.780
and in a fortuitous coincidence,

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:48.885
Tyler happens to be an identical
twin he and his brother

00:15:48.885 --> 00:15:51.475
Chad share the same genes.

00:15:51.475 --> 00:15:54.991
- I think I might have
worn an orange shirt.

00:15:54.991 --> 00:15:59.158
- [Announcer] But surprisingly
not the same memory.

00:16:09.592 --> 00:16:11.259
- Life can be tough.

00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:18.316
This is very interesting we
are doing genetic studies

00:16:18.316 --> 00:16:21.588
now are collaborating in genetic studies.

00:16:21.588 --> 00:16:23.581
And the first thing we want to find out is

00:16:23.581 --> 00:16:26.059
are they really identical twins.

00:16:26.059 --> 00:16:27.689
The parents claim that they are and we're

00:16:27.689 --> 00:16:30.079
going to re-check that.

00:16:30.079 --> 00:16:32.757
Once again the reason for
the interest in children is

00:16:32.757 --> 00:16:36.585
because we want to find out
the the age at which this is

00:16:36.585 --> 00:16:39.231
first recognized by children.

00:16:39.231 --> 00:16:41.047
We have younger children now who are 10

00:16:41.047 --> 00:16:43.308
years old who have the ability going

00:16:43.308 --> 00:16:46.116
back to the age of five and a little bit

00:16:46.116 --> 00:16:47.924
earlier than that.

00:16:47.924 --> 00:16:52.433
So this is not a an ability
which is acquired later in life

00:16:52.433 --> 00:16:54.592
it appears fairly early on how early we

00:16:54.592 --> 00:16:56.490
don't yet know.

00:16:56.490 --> 00:17:00.926
Now here is a distribution
of the the ability of

00:17:00.926 --> 00:17:03.563
people who have what we call h sam or

00:17:03.563 --> 00:17:06.629
highly superior autobiographical memory

00:17:06.629 --> 00:17:10.231
and on the right in a white and blue you

00:17:10.231 --> 00:17:12.443
see the distribution of the percent

00:17:12.443 --> 00:17:14.551
correct on a 30 question quiz

00:17:14.551 --> 00:17:17.874
of the kind that i've
already talked about.

00:17:17.874 --> 00:17:21.127
Ranging from let's say 35 percent correct,

00:17:21.127 --> 00:17:23.177
up to 75 percent correct.

00:17:23.177 --> 00:17:26.597
On the left in orange
you see controls age and

00:17:26.597 --> 00:17:30.486
sex match controls and you can see that

00:17:30.486 --> 00:17:33.358
this is not this ability is not the end

00:17:33.358 --> 00:17:35.327
of an arc extreme end of a normal

00:17:35.327 --> 00:17:37.225
distribution it is a different

00:17:37.225 --> 00:17:39.945
distribution also you can see some white

00:17:39.945 --> 00:17:42.113
on the left mixed for the orange these

00:17:42.113 --> 00:17:44.114
are people who claim that they had the

00:17:44.114 --> 00:17:46.436
ability and were just like controls if

00:17:46.436 --> 00:17:49.677
you look on the far left there are four

00:17:49.677 --> 00:17:51.681
people who claim they have the ability

00:17:51.681 --> 00:17:55.489
and they aren't worse than controls.

00:17:55.489 --> 00:17:58.822
we gave the best of those a tendex quiz,

00:18:00.034 --> 00:18:04.914
asking for 10 dates that we
selected the day of the week a

00:18:04.914 --> 00:18:08.577
verifiable event that
happened on that day,

00:18:08.577 --> 00:18:11.411
an autobiographical event
which we did not check,

00:18:11.411 --> 00:18:13.464
but they claimed it was autobiographical.

00:18:13.464 --> 00:18:16.188
And what you can see
is in the blue are the

00:18:16.188 --> 00:18:18.423
people that have this ability and the

00:18:18.423 --> 00:18:22.086
orange are us and you can see that they

00:18:22.086 --> 00:18:24.637
get about 14 percent correct on day of

00:18:24.637 --> 00:18:28.470
the week which is one
out of seven by the way.

00:18:33.586 --> 00:18:38.157
They have no verifiable
event and so you see,

00:18:38.157 --> 00:18:40.594
they're quite different we also gave them.

00:18:40.594 --> 00:18:44.553
an autobiographical memory
test and here they validated.

00:18:44.553 --> 00:18:46.209
We asked him the first day at university,

00:18:46.209 --> 00:18:48.987
the first day at elementary
school so on down the list

00:18:48.987 --> 00:18:51.377
that you can see and we've actually got

00:18:51.377 --> 00:18:54.148
all of the data support all of that our

00:18:54.148 --> 00:18:57.565
H Sam subjects gave 145 verified details.

00:18:58.906 --> 00:19:01.414
Controls gave a total of 24 details

00:19:01.414 --> 00:19:04.247
which we did not bother to verify.

00:19:05.207 --> 00:19:06.770
All right here are some characteristics.

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:08.398
These folks are highly accurate on

00:19:08.398 --> 00:19:10.643
autobiographical remembering.

00:19:10.643 --> 00:19:12.610
They are not at all
exceptional and learning and

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:14.992
laboratory tests we've done a lot of

00:19:14.992 --> 00:19:17.767
experimental psychology types of tests

00:19:17.767 --> 00:19:20.427
with them and they're absolutely on

00:19:20.427 --> 00:19:23.072
average normal one thing that is of

00:19:23.072 --> 00:19:25.574
interest they also show signs of

00:19:25.574 --> 00:19:28.085
compulsiveness and they saw some

00:19:28.085 --> 00:19:28.918
differences in brain region so I'll show

00:19:28.918 --> 00:19:32.168
you quickly here here's a region to the

00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:35.896
uncinate fasciculus which is a fiber

00:19:35.896 --> 00:19:37.983
pathway that goes from the temporal lobe

00:19:37.983 --> 00:19:40.312
up to the frontal lobes and this is more

00:19:40.312 --> 00:19:43.395
obvious in an MRI structural MRI it's

00:19:45.497 --> 00:19:47.566
also a region that is found to be

00:19:47.566 --> 00:19:49.285
deficient in people who have highly

00:19:49.285 --> 00:19:50.118
deficient autobiographical memory the

00:19:50.118 --> 00:19:53.285
parahippocampal gyrus which is not too

00:19:55.591 --> 00:19:57.617
much of a surprise because that region

00:19:57.617 --> 00:19:58.450
has been implicated in memory and also

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:02.166
found in people who would have
strong memory of other kinds

00:20:02.166 --> 00:20:06.034
and the Lentiform nucleus
which is in the region of

00:20:06.034 --> 00:20:09.154
the caudate nucleus which has a some

00:20:09.154 --> 00:20:12.522
studies have shown to be significant

00:20:12.522 --> 00:20:14.572
significantly observed in people who

00:20:14.572 --> 00:20:18.558
have obsessive-compulsive disorder and

00:20:18.558 --> 00:20:21.330
all of our people score highly on

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:24.082
obsessive-compulsive tests and they also

00:20:24.082 --> 00:20:27.332
display an obsessiveness germ avoidance

00:20:28.188 --> 00:20:29.021
and other things I have a time

00:20:29.021 --> 00:20:29.854
I could tell you some very
interesting things about what

00:20:29.854 --> 00:20:30.687
they avoid so here are
some important questions.

00:20:30.687 --> 00:20:31.520
First what insights can
we learn about memory,

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:34.687
is it strong storage of information or

00:20:42.167 --> 00:20:44.719
is it exceptional retrieval we don't

00:20:44.719 --> 00:20:45.552
think is simply exceptional
retrieval because

00:20:45.552 --> 00:20:49.719
it's exceptional retrieval
of their own autobiographical

00:20:51.209 --> 00:20:52.042
experiences not of other things.

00:20:52.042 --> 00:20:52.875
We even did an experiment
in which we gave them

00:20:52.875 --> 00:20:53.708
some information and then they had a

00:20:53.708 --> 00:20:56.708
discussion with the experimenter and

00:21:00.926 --> 00:21:02.520
they were tested later on they

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.139
remembered everything that they said and

00:21:04.139 --> 00:21:07.117
nothing that the experimenter said so it

00:21:07.117 --> 00:21:08.867
it is all about them.

00:21:14.467 --> 00:21:17.122
Is their involvement of
a rote emotional arousal

00:21:17.122 --> 00:21:19.305
well that's what I do for a living

00:21:19.305 --> 00:21:21.859
that's my main research and yet we have

00:21:21.859 --> 00:21:23.856
plenty of examples of them remembering

00:21:23.856 --> 00:21:26.276
pretty banal things you saw that list

00:21:26.276 --> 00:21:28.913
that I showed you my favorite example is

00:21:28.913 --> 00:21:29.746
our first subject I asked him if asked her

00:21:29.746 --> 00:21:30.579
if she knew who Bing Crosby was and

00:21:30.579 --> 00:21:33.554
she said yes she would
have been very young

00:21:33.554 --> 00:21:36.304
maybe in her teenage years I said

00:21:38.719 --> 00:21:40.735
you know what happened to him and she

00:21:40.735 --> 00:21:42.168
said oh yes he died on the Golf Course

00:21:42.168 --> 00:21:43.916
in Spain and she gave me the date and

00:21:43.916 --> 00:21:46.542
the day and I said how did you know that

00:21:46.542 --> 00:21:47.375
she said well my mother was driving me

00:21:47.375 --> 00:21:49.943
to a soccer game and the news came on

00:21:49.943 --> 00:21:54.569
over the radio and she
remembers that to this day.

00:21:54.569 --> 00:21:56.259
Is there a genetic basis we are

00:21:56.259 --> 00:21:59.547
studying that at the
present time we don't know

00:21:59.547 --> 00:22:01.555
Neuro biological implications I think

00:22:01.555 --> 00:22:03.624
this is the most important one and this

00:22:03.624 --> 00:22:06.084
has been touched on
already in the symposium.

00:22:06.084 --> 00:22:08.984
These these individuals not

00:22:08.984 --> 00:22:12.801
only can give us clues to
understanding how their

00:22:12.801 --> 00:22:17.031
brain works in order to produce
this this really phenomenal

00:22:17.031 --> 00:22:20.281
memory ability but by understanding the

00:22:21.599 --> 00:22:23.507
neural underpinnings of this we can get

00:22:23.507 --> 00:22:25.639
a greater understanding of how the brain

00:22:25.639 --> 00:22:28.518
processes memory new insights can come

00:22:28.518 --> 00:22:30.685
from from this ultimately.

00:22:32.552 --> 00:22:35.992
And finally why is this
ability so rarer if memory

00:22:35.992 --> 00:22:38.295
is so important I started off by saying

00:22:38.295 --> 00:22:42.334
as our most important ability
why is it that we are so poor

00:22:42.334 --> 00:22:46.334
in what do and in a certain
way they are better?

00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:51.113
William James said forgetting
is as important the function

00:22:51.113 --> 00:22:55.505
as recollecting if we remembered
everything we should be

00:22:55.505 --> 00:22:59.999
on most occasions as ill off
as if we remembered nothing.

00:22:59.999 --> 00:23:04.075
These people remember an awful
lot about in a way nothing.

00:23:04.075 --> 00:23:06.985
Just trivial events they remember it quite

00:23:06.985 --> 00:23:10.574
well they are unremarkable
in other respects

00:23:10.574 --> 00:23:12.910
if they were here in the room and there

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:14.731
may be several people people here.

00:23:14.731 --> 00:23:17.906
If you didn't ask memory
questions you would not be able to

00:23:17.906 --> 00:23:19.435
identify them.

00:23:19.435 --> 00:23:22.450
They remember for a long
period of time and we

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:25.735
need to find out and our research
will continue to do that.

00:23:25.735 --> 00:23:26.568
Thank you
