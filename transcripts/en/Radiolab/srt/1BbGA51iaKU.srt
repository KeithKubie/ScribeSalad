1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,270
I'll say this is radio lab, the podcast,
and you take it from there. Ready?

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,900
All right. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad, I'm
Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab,

3
00:00:06,901 --> 00:00:11,670
the BOD pod. Let me say, okay, sorry.
This is radio lab, the podcast.

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,890
Damn you, come on. No,
he's like, you know what,

5
00:00:14,891 --> 00:00:19,360
actually this is a sort of appropriate
because we will want to talk about

6
00:00:19,361 --> 00:00:20,410
sharing right now. I,

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,510
that's all I was doing and I was
trying to share the moment with you

8
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:27,120
unsuccessfully. But so our
last hour was all about, uh,

9
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,670
trying to solve the puzzle of
why is there niceness in a very,

10
00:00:30,671 --> 00:00:32,140
very cruel doggy dog world.

11
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,880
Why would there be any kind
of sharing your niceness?

12
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,940
And as we asked the scientist in the show,
which we call the good show this way,

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,530
he just kept saying over
and over again, well,

14
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:43,960
oftentimes what you would call nice
behavior is actually disguised selfishness

15
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:45,730
as critters of one kind or another.

16
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:50,260
Try to push their genes into the future
by being nice to particular folks,

17
00:00:50,261 --> 00:00:53,100
to their sisters, to
their cousins, to others,

18
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,480
and to those who are from their family,

19
00:00:55,481 --> 00:00:58,360
which share so many of their
genes like according to some,

20
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:01,930
like a real hard ass biologist could
argue if you're nice to your sister,

21
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,650
you're really just being nice to your
own jeans in another person's body.

22
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,400
And we were like, Huh, yeah. Is there
another way of thinking about this?

23
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,050
And so we met a guy, my
name is Jerry Wilkinson.

24
00:01:14,051 --> 00:01:18,850
I'm a professor and chair of the
Department of biology at the University of

25
00:01:18,851 --> 00:01:20,170
Maryland College Park.

26
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,400
And the story that Jerry told us happened
way before he was a chair or anything

27
00:01:24,401 --> 00:01:27,270
like that when he was
a lowly Grad student.

28
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,170
The first summer of my graduate
education I went to Costa Rica.

29
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,860
This was the summer of 1977
we went all over the country.

30
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,770
You've studied various things and we
had an opportunity to apply for money to

31
00:01:38,771 --> 00:01:42,280
stay in Costa Rica and
do individual projects.

32
00:01:42,281 --> 00:01:45,760
And Jerry decided what he was
going to study. Where bats,

33
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,560
why bats have you always liked that?

34
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,630
I'd never actually handled the bat before
I went to Costa Rica so I had no prior

35
00:01:52,631 --> 00:01:56,990
experience whatsoever and I was like
anyone I think may be a little bit uh,

36
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:58,120
hesitant I guess,

37
00:01:58,121 --> 00:02:02,230
but he says he just happened to be in
this place that had a lot of bats cause I

38
00:02:02,231 --> 00:02:07,100
was on a cattle ranch otherwise
known as the McDonald's of a

39
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,760
yes because there's something we haven't
told you here. These were vampire bats,

40
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,390
the common vampire bat,

41
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:21,190
which feeds primarily on Mammalian blood
and these particular batch Jerry's has

42
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,690
lived down by the river in
hollow trees, big ones inside.

43
00:02:25,691 --> 00:02:29,560
They were like Kate threes along the
rivers and every night he says hundreds of

44
00:02:29,561 --> 00:02:31,600
these bats would fly out of their trees,

45
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,150
kind of like a cloud

46
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,860
move across the fields,
hitting towards cow herd.

47
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:47,150
Basically they will hop up
onto a cow, sink their teeth,

48
00:02:47,151 --> 00:02:51,620
razor sharp teeth into the cow's
neck and start sucking its blood.

49
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,690
And in a matter of about a half an hour,

50
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:58,220
they basically swell up like a big
tick and fly home to the tree quickly.

51
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,100
Then they come back the trees. Anyhow,

52
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,810
what Jerry was really interested in was
not so much the cow split sucking thing.

53
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,470
It was how do the bats
behave with each other? Yeah,

54
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,480
so one morning he went down to
the river where these bats live,

55
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,610
found himself a tree. These trees,

56
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:17,611
some of them were so big that I could
actually lie down inside the tree without

57
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:19,570
bending my knees.

58
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:24,790
We would use binoculars to look
up at the top of the cavity,

59
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:30,180
which could be anywhere from 15
feet to 40 feet above the ground.

60
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,780
Now picture this, you're in the street.
It's four stories high. It's dark,

61
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,000
it's wet and up at the
top. How many are up there?

62
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:41,750
Maybe 20 would be sort of some of
the larger groups. What about poop?

63
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:44,620
Weren't they pooping on you because
you write in the direct line? Yes.

64
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:49,540
They do that and it's sort of like
tar. When they defecate blood,

65
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,080
it's very sticky, but day after
day he would go into these trees,

66
00:03:53,081 --> 00:03:55,060
get pooped on and watch them.

67
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:59,410
Pretty soon he starts to notice that
these bats are behaving in ways he really

68
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,310
didn't expect.

69
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,500
They behave quite a bit like primates,

70
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:09,550
meaning what? They spend a lot
of time grooming each other.

71
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,120
Really 30% of the time in the trees
they spend grooming each other. Huh.

72
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,020
So there you were looking
at these reputedly evil
creatures and seeing them kind

73
00:04:17,021 --> 00:04:19,900
of snuggle. I mean, were you
surprised by this? Oh yeah.

74
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,590
Took me no time at all
to become very fond,

75
00:04:23,591 --> 00:04:26,920
I guess would be the best way to
describe it. They are very social.

76
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:28,600
They're very interactive.

77
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:32,750
But then Jerry saw one of
the dudes something, um,

78
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:37,020
that went way beyond just being social.
You know, it's, it's hard to say.

79
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,690
Certainly it not a single observation,
but basically here's how it would go.

80
00:04:40,691 --> 00:04:41,380
One Bat.

81
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:45,940
One Bat will sort of sidle up to another
bat and give her a little hug and they

82
00:04:45,941 --> 00:04:50,020
sort of clutch each other with
their wings, which are folded up.

83
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:54,040
And then the bat that made the
move, it came up and gave the hug.

84
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:59,041
You'd see that bat try the lick
at the mouth of the other bat.

85
00:04:59,051 --> 00:05:01,480
The one it's hugging. And
if you have a good view,

86
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:05,590
you can actually see the tongue of one
bat going into the mouth of the other

87
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:09,460
bat. Like they're giving each
other a kiss. Very similar. Yes.

88
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,770
But after seeing this a few times,

89
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:16,771
he realized what really was happening is
that the one bat was feeding the other

90
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:22,330
bat. Yes. Giving it a meal
by regurgitating blood
into the other bats mouth.

91
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:27,160
And that was a shock.
A shock because, well,

92
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:28,660
these weren't moms feeding their babies.

93
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,550
I mean that we've all
seen and that makes sense.

94
00:05:30,551 --> 00:05:34,060
Now these were adult animals
eating other adult animals,

95
00:05:34,061 --> 00:05:36,880
food that they could've been eating
themselves. Right. Just weird.

96
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,100
That had not been described before.

97
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:44,290
There's any thought we didn't need a
second. I know what's going on here.

98
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:49,420
What? These bats, they're just
related. Correct. Their relatives.

99
00:05:49,421 --> 00:05:50,910
Close relatives. Yeah.

100
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,640
The idea that was in vogue
then and is still in vogue now,

101
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:58,400
and certainly it's actually got much
more support now than it did then,

102
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,710
is that animals tend to help close
relatives and sort of never help anybody

103
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:06,970
who's not a close relative. So we
thought that must be it. They're related,

104
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,580
but you don't just assume it. You
must test it if you're a scientist.

105
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,380
So Jerry did, okay, I'm
going to check this out.

106
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:14,860
I'm going to set up a
little experiment. Yes.

107
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,230
So he went out and got a bunch of
bats that he knew were not related.

108
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:21,410
Like I had two groups
of six total of 12 bats,

109
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,040
brought them into my house at the
time, went to slaughter house,

110
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,023
got a lot of blood,

111
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:31,030
and then every night I would take one of
the 12 bats out of the cage and not let

112
00:06:31,401 --> 00:06:34,520
it feed while everybody
else got access to blood,

113
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:36,800
which means this sad
little bag. It's no dinner,

114
00:06:36,801 --> 00:06:38,570
but it has to watch the others eat.

115
00:06:38,571 --> 00:06:42,050
And it's just getting
hungrier and hungrier. Well,

116
00:06:42,051 --> 00:06:46,310
how long can a bat go with no
blood? Three days at most, at most,

117
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,790
and then they're dead. So you can
imagine that by the time the sun rises,

118
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,730
this bat is literally
starving. And then at dawn,

119
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,370
I would put the female
back in who hadn't fed.

120
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:00,020
She will go and beg
from other individuals.

121
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:05,450
And weirdly, instead of them saying to
her, you're not my sister, I'll go off.

122
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,411
Yeah. According to Jerry,

123
00:07:06,411 --> 00:07:11,411
what would happen is that they in hold
still part their lips and throw up in her

124
00:07:12,321 --> 00:07:13,154
mouth.

125
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,420
[inaudible]

126
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,090
thank you.

127
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:19,920
I mean at that point I was thrilled that
I had found something that seemed to

128
00:07:19,921 --> 00:07:23,220
indicate that there, it wasn't
just all about relatedness,

129
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,720
just to make sure this wasn't a fluke.

130
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:29,750
What I then did over the span of the
next two weeks as I continued to take one

131
00:07:30,091 --> 00:07:34,050
bat out of the cage every night and you'd
do the whole starver Tilden thing and

132
00:07:34,051 --> 00:07:37,640
then put her back in the cage with the
others and she was always [inaudible]

133
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,413
[inaudible]

134
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,670
and by someone from her group,

135
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,240
and occasionally even by more than
one individual from her group,

136
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:48,210
sometimes one bat will step up
and say, okay, have something.

137
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,130
And then maybe another, sometimes
a third, and he's talking question,

138
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,780
I wonder what's going on here. Is this
random or is there some kind of system?

139
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:57,120
He, he just couldn't really tell.

140
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:02,190
So then I just kept track of who
fed home while I was there. I was,

141
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:03,210
you know, staying up all night.

142
00:08:03,211 --> 00:08:08,211
I wasn't really doing a lot of analysis
of the information and I was only there

143
00:08:08,311 --> 00:08:12,330
for a relatively short period.
I got back up to San Diego,

144
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,980
did the analysis and discovered that
there appeared to be, to be a pattern.

145
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,590
If, um, you know,

146
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,840
Sally Fed Agnes on the first day
and then I later starved Sally,

147
00:08:27,271 --> 00:08:31,650
then Agnes fed Sally on the second night.

148
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,840
Right. Let's just go
through this one more time.

149
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:37,710
If on the first day Sally fed Agnes,

150
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:42,630
then on the second day
Agnes fed Sally invariably,

151
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,370
not always, but invariably,

152
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:49,200
and what is invariably mean in that
most of the time, most of the time,

153
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,240
most of the time. So if I'm Agnes,

154
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:56,450
I'm only going to feed Sally under the
condition that at some later point in

155
00:08:56,731 --> 00:09:00,370
time she will repay the favor. I see you,

156
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:04,670
you feed me Agnes seeds,
Sally, Sally feeds.

157
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,260
And if you think about it that
this is kind of what friendship is.

158
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,940
I mean we never say that explicitly,

159
00:09:09,941 --> 00:09:13,810
but friendship works on these kinds
of trees. I'm going to be Pete, Cindy,

160
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,950
Cindy feet, Mindy. In variably,
in fact with the bats,

161
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,110
Gerry at a certain point created a kind
of matrix that lotted who had spent time

162
00:09:23,111 --> 00:09:25,540
with whom the friendships
between the individual bets.

163
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:30,550
And that allowed me to actually
calculate a number that measured,

164
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:34,270
you know, who was the best friends and
who were the not such good friends.

165
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:37,120
Like a friend number. Yes.
Who was this? So eighth grade.

166
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:42,330
And it turns out that number is the
best predictor of who will feed him.

167
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,790
It's better than who's
related to better. Yes.

168
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,560
Although it turned out that
they both were important. So,

169
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,850
but I want to write a headline around
this. You're saying that, that,

170
00:09:51,851 --> 00:09:54,250
that that buddies beat kin.

171
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,090
Yes. Yes. I'll go with this beans if, if,

172
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:01,800
if friends can beat family
than if be first of all,

173
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,740
have friends or people
that you choose. Yeah.

174
00:10:03,741 --> 00:10:06,140
I mean you've stuck with your family,
but you can choose your friends.

175
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:11,450
That's in effect an idea that niceness
is really deeply chosen. Yeah.

176
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,580
Well. So what is the, so
what is w in the, in the, uh,

177
00:10:13,581 --> 00:10:15,980
in the broad scientific
community, does this,

178
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:21,100
does this mean what you counted
and saw open up altogether?

179
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:25,280
Again, the question of
who helps who and why?

180
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,023
Uh,

181
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,930
ah, yes, but now we're talking 1984,

182
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:35,380
that's when this work was published
and the Hoe, that's when the sort of,

183
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,810
and I gave talks about it various places.

184
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,680
So it became well known pretty quickly
and, and it was a really big deal.

185
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,310
In fact, some scientists thought maybe
this is going to revolutionize our whole

186
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:49,960
understanding of niceness and nature and
social dynamics and creatures because

187
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,380
you know, maybe this behavior
isn't just a bad thing.

188
00:10:53,381 --> 00:10:56,080
It's everywhere and we just
haven't been seeing it.

189
00:10:56,081 --> 00:10:57,910
We haven't been working
hard enough to see it.

190
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:02,500
Like this Jerry Guy slept in a tree
got pooped on for weeks on end.

191
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:06,940
Maybe if we pushed ourselves that far,
we'd find this all over the place.

192
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:12,160
But no, didn't work out that way.

193
00:11:12,161 --> 00:11:17,161
There are not many convincing cases that
I think people identified in those next

194
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:23,860
few years. So the observation
you're making may not be large,

195
00:11:23,861 --> 00:11:25,210
just may be writ small.

196
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,490
Um, yeah. Well

197
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,340
I'm not sure I would
describe it exactly that way,

198
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:36,750
but clearly it's how much
we can extrapolate the
Vampyr event story to other

199
00:11:36,751 --> 00:11:39,510
systems is an open
question and well in your,

200
00:11:39,511 --> 00:11:41,910
in your most extrapolated frame of mind,

201
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:47,250
maybe when you were sitting in a bar and
your three Martinis in and in your gut

202
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,950
and your drunk gut at that
moment, what is your hunch?

203
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:55,040
Is this a representative case and we
just haven't found it elsewhere but we

204
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:59,740
will? Or is this a one off? Oh,

205
00:11:59,741 --> 00:12:02,350
I don't think it's unique, but
I don't think it's very common.

206
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,110
I think it would be quite
uncommon. You know, they have,

207
00:12:05,111 --> 00:12:09,610
our vets are really pretty special
because of this reliance on blood.

208
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:13,030
Here's one story you could tell.
It says Jerry way back in the day,

209
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,940
40,000 or more years in the past,

210
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,990
the planes where the bats lived were
filled with all of these giant creatures.

211
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:23,290
Big mammals were abundant.
Saber Tooth Tigers,

212
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,090
mammoth wolves,

213
00:12:25,091 --> 00:12:29,140
then giant slaws and all of these
things were filled with warm blood.

214
00:12:29,141 --> 00:12:30,340
So the bats were very happy.

215
00:12:30,341 --> 00:12:35,341
But presumably there was a point in
time when all of these large mammals is

216
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:40,750
appeared really fast and there all kinds
of theories as to why that happened.

217
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:45,780
The point is it must have created a time
when vampire bats all of a sudden had a

218
00:12:46,001 --> 00:12:47,320
hard time finding prey.

219
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,920
At that point I would think it would have
been behoove a vampire bat to come up

220
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:58,441
with some way to deal with periodic food
Georges and he thinks the strategy they

221
00:12:58,481 --> 00:13:02,620
came up with somehow somehow was to share.

222
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,330
If they didn't help each other,

223
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:08,230
I think you would find vampire bats gone.

224
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,890
I mean we wouldn't see them. Um, now,

225
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:13,900
well this is interesting.

226
00:13:13,901 --> 00:13:18,290
This is a new way to explore the question
we've been exploring all this time and

227
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,580
they show their niceness in the
world. Yeah, no. Up to now we thought,

228
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:27,060
well mostly niceness is a
secret form of selfishness,

229
00:13:28,151 --> 00:13:31,720
selfishness, selfishness,
Dean's into the future. Yeah.

230
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,910
But this is a different version.
This one says, you know,

231
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,700
under certain circumstances
for a group of animals,

232
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,700
being nice really isn't an option. It's

233
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:44,230
the only way. Yeah. Like when the
going gets tough, the tough get.

234
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,600
Nice. How's that for a bumper sticker?
