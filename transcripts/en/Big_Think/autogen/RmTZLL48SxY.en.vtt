this might be going on some of this but
 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.929
this might be going on some of this but
I suspect that just as those kind of

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939
I suspect that just as those kind of
 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.660

exploits of Roman emperors are our

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670
exploits of Roman emperors are our
 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.330
exploits of Roman emperors are our
fantasies yeah can we think of the most

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340

amazing things that people can get up to

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140
amazing things that people can get up to
 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.169

Roman writers to when they when they

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939
Roman writers to when they when they
 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.419
Roman writers to when they when they
kind of invented these stories about

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429
kind of invented these stories about
 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:50.959
kind of invented these stories about
people in power and I think there are

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:50.969
people in power and I think there are
 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:54.819
people in power and I think there are
very very important differences between

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829
