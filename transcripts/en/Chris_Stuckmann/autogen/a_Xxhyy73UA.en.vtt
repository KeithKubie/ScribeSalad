00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:52.949 align:start position:0%
movie when I was watching and I was like
 

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:54.409 align:start position:0%
movie when I was watching and I was like
really<00:03:53.190><c> this</c><00:03:53.370><c> is</c><00:03:53.549><c> what</c><00:03:53.910><c> they're</c><00:03:54.090><c> doing</c><00:03:54.329><c> this</c>

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:54.419 align:start position:0%
really this is what they're doing this
 

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:56.119 align:start position:0%
really this is what they're doing this
is<00:03:54.480><c> the</c><00:03:54.629><c> direction</c><00:03:54.870><c> they're</c><00:03:55.049><c> taking</c><00:03:55.379><c> and</c><00:03:55.560><c> it</c>

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.129 align:start position:0%
is the direction they're taking and it
 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:57.710 align:start position:0%
is the direction they're taking and it
seems<00:03:56.430><c> odd</c><00:03:56.730><c> you</c><00:03:57.090><c> know</c><00:03:57.209><c> but</c><00:03:57.419><c> then</c><00:03:57.510><c> when</c><00:03:57.659><c> you</c>

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
seems odd you know but then when you
 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.599 align:start position:0%
seems odd you know but then when you
look<00:03:57.900><c> back</c><00:03:58.079><c> on</c><00:03:58.109><c> the</c><00:03:58.349><c> movie</c><00:03:58.680><c> you</c><00:03:58.980><c> can</c><00:03:59.010><c> go</c><00:03:59.430><c> like</c>

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 align:start position:0%
look back on the movie you can go like
 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
look back on the movie you can go like
you<00:03:59.940><c> know</c><00:03:59.970><c> okay</c><00:04:00.870><c> I</c><00:04:01.169><c> can't</c><00:04:01.470><c> I</c><00:04:01.560><c> guess</c><00:04:01.769><c> that</c><00:04:02.010><c> kind</c>

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 align:start position:0%
you know okay I can't I guess that kind
 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.589 align:start position:0%
you know okay I can't I guess that kind
of<00:04:02.310><c> makes</c><00:04:02.489><c> sense</c><00:04:02.579><c> and</c><00:04:03.030><c> it's</c><00:04:03.180><c> because</c><00:04:03.449><c> there</c>

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
of makes sense and it's because there
 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:04.729 align:start position:0%
of makes sense and it's because there
are<00:04:03.690><c> certain</c><00:04:03.989><c> things</c><00:04:04.019><c> once</c><00:04:04.440><c> again</c><00:04:04.650><c> without</c>

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 align:start position:0%
are certain things once again without
 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.649 align:start position:0%
are certain things once again without

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 align:start position:0%
don't really think it's going to do but
 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.469 align:start position:0%
don't really think it's going to do but
then<00:04:08.370><c> when</c><00:04:08.489><c> you</c><00:04:08.549><c> look</c><00:04:08.760><c> back</c><00:04:08.940><c> on</c><00:04:09.000><c> their</c><00:04:09.269><c> film</c>
