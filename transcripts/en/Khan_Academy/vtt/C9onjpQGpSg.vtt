00:00:00.647 --> 00:00:02.861
Voiceover: What I want to do in this
video is think a little bit about

00:00:02.861 --> 00:00:07.176
how the unemployment
rate is actually computed

00:00:07.176 --> 00:00:10.009
by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:14.330
So to figure that out let's just start
off with the entire U.S. population.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.597
So let me draw a big
circle here that represents

00:00:17.597 --> 00:00:20.264
the entire U.S. population.

00:00:20.264 --> 00:00:26.402
U.S. population and right now
if my numbers are correct,

00:00:26.402 --> 00:00:31.931
the latest numbers are 304 million people.

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:37.403
Now, not all of those 304 million
people are capable of working,

00:00:37.403 --> 00:00:42.263
including my two and a half year
old son or my newborn daughter

00:00:42.263 --> 00:00:44.485
so you have to think of, when
you think about unemployment,

00:00:44.485 --> 00:00:46.735
you want to think about the
percentage of these people

00:00:46.735 --> 00:00:48.998
that are actually old enough to work.

00:00:48.998 --> 00:00:51.664
That actually can be
employed theoretically.

00:00:51.664 --> 00:00:54.402
So let's take a subset
of that U.S. population

00:00:54.402 --> 00:00:58.197
and let's think about who's essentially
an adult, who's working age.

00:00:58.197 --> 00:01:04.402
So this subset right over
here is 16 years and older,

00:01:04.402 --> 00:01:08.320
so people who can legally work
and the numbers I have here

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.331
is that this is 100-

00:01:10.331 --> 00:01:14.736
sorry, this right here
is 237 million people.

00:01:14.736 --> 00:01:17.736
237 million people.

00:01:17.736 --> 00:01:21.184
Now we can't just say all of
these people could possibly work

00:01:21.184 --> 00:01:24.518
because a lot of them are in college,
some of them are in high school,

00:01:24.518 --> 00:01:27.117
some of them might not
have the ability to work,

00:01:27.117 --> 00:01:28.678
some of them might be retired.

00:01:28.678 --> 00:01:31.261
So what we want to do is take
a subset of this population,

00:01:31.261 --> 00:01:37.517
that is essentially part of the
labor force in that they are working

00:01:37.517 --> 00:01:40.316
or they are actively looking for work.

00:01:40.316 --> 00:01:43.785
So let me draw that right over here.

00:01:43.785 --> 00:01:48.183
So this right over here
is the labor force.

00:01:48.183 --> 00:01:52.678
Labor force, so these are not
retirees or people who are in college.

00:01:52.678 --> 00:01:55.052
Those people would be sitting
right over there assuming

00:01:55.052 --> 00:01:56.718
they're 16 years or older.

00:01:56.718 --> 00:02:01.011
The labor force, so this is working or-

00:02:01.011 --> 00:02:04.116
or I should say working and
actively looking for work,

00:02:04.116 --> 00:02:07.344
and we'll think about what
actively looking for work means

00:02:07.344 --> 00:02:09.583
in a little bit more
depth in a few minutes.

00:02:09.583 --> 00:02:15.260
Actively looking for work.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.860
And that number if my numbers are
correct is right around 154 million

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.260
although the numbers
here aren't so important,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.666
the more important thing is
how the unemployment rate

00:02:24.666 --> 00:02:26.335
itself is calculated.

00:02:26.335 --> 00:02:29.335
And so then within the labor
force you have a subset,

00:02:29.335 --> 00:02:32.860
so this is working and actively
looking for work, so you have a subset

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.260
of the labor force that is
actively looking for work.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.002
So they don't have a job but
they're actively looking.

00:02:40.002 --> 00:02:49.198
So this right here is
unemployed and actively looking.

00:02:49.198 --> 00:02:51.948
Actively looking and this
actively looking is probably

00:02:51.948 --> 00:02:55.395
more important than you
might realize at first.

00:02:55.395 --> 00:02:57.794
And this number, let's just
say for the sake of argument,

00:02:57.794 --> 00:03:00.735
this is sitting at
around 15 million people.

00:03:00.735 --> 00:03:02.085
15 million people.

00:03:02.085 --> 00:03:05.498
So if you have a job
you're right over here,

00:03:05.498 --> 00:03:08.308
if you don't have a job
but are actively looking

00:03:08.308 --> 00:03:10.390
you're going to be right over here.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.122
What we're going to see in a little
bit is if you don't have a job

00:03:15.122 --> 00:03:18.123
but you are not actively looking
but you could be working,

00:03:18.123 --> 00:03:20.922
you would actually be sitting out here.

00:03:20.922 --> 00:03:22.807
This is going to be
interesting when we think about

00:03:22.807 --> 00:03:26.057
trends in the unemployment
rate when it goes up or down.

00:03:26.057 --> 00:03:28.456
But just to see how the
unemployment rate is calculated,

00:03:28.456 --> 00:03:30.391
let's just do it for this example.

00:03:30.391 --> 00:03:32.390
So the unemployment rate-

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:42.474
unemployment rate is literally
just the number of unemployed

00:03:42.474 --> 00:03:45.224
over the entire labor force.

00:03:45.224 --> 00:03:49.322
So in this situation
it would be 15 million-

00:03:49.322 --> 00:03:52.457
so that's just the number of
unemployed and actively looking

00:03:52.457 --> 00:03:54.922
over the entire labor force.

00:03:54.922 --> 00:04:02.063
Over 154 million and so if
we get my handy TI-85 out,

00:04:02.063 --> 00:04:05.390
that gives us in this
example right over here,

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:11.657
an unemployment rate of
15 divided by 154 million.

00:04:11.657 --> 00:04:17.722
So it's about 9.7, if we write
it as a decimal it's 0.097,

00:04:17.722 --> 00:04:22.256
if we write it as a percentage
this would be 9.7 percent.

00:04:22.256 --> 00:04:28.323
This is approximately 9.7 percent.

00:04:28.323 --> 00:04:31.475
Now I told you that the details
are going to be important

00:04:31.475 --> 00:04:34.308
and the reason why they are is
because interesting things happen

00:04:34.308 --> 00:04:38.891
when people stop looking for work
or when they start looking for work.

00:04:38.891 --> 00:04:43.590
So I said unemployed and actively looking
puts you in this bucket over here.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:44.989
If you're unemployed,
if you don't have a job,

00:04:44.989 --> 00:04:48.989
and you're not actively looking you're
actually not in the labor force.

00:04:48.989 --> 00:04:51.657
And so you might be saying,
"Sal, what does it mean

00:04:51.657 --> 00:04:54.257
"to be actively looking for work?"

00:04:54.257 --> 00:04:57.722
And this means that you've looked for
a job or you are actively searching

00:04:57.722 --> 00:05:03.856
in the past, let me do this in a
new color, in the past four weeks.

00:05:03.856 --> 00:05:06.260
Past four weeks.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.677
And you might say, "Sal, how do they
know whether these 15 million people

00:05:11.677 --> 00:05:16.427
"have actively searched for
jobs in the past four weeks?"

00:05:16.427 --> 00:05:17.657
And the answer is they do a survey.

00:05:17.657 --> 00:05:20.791
They're not going to survey every
human being in the labor force

00:05:20.791 --> 00:05:24.262
or the U.S. population or all
15 million that are unemployed,

00:05:24.262 --> 00:05:26.094
that would be logistically impossible.

00:05:26.094 --> 00:05:28.456
What they do is they do a
survey and right now they do

00:05:28.456 --> 00:05:32.522
about 60,000 people every month
and they essentially ask them

00:05:32.522 --> 00:05:35.594
are you employed, are you
unemployed, if you are unemployed

00:05:35.594 --> 00:05:38.927
have you looked for a job
in the past four weeks?

00:05:38.927 --> 00:05:41.011
If you have looked for a
job in the past four weeks

00:05:41.011 --> 00:05:44.093
as an unemployed person you get
thrown into this bucket right here,

00:05:44.093 --> 00:05:45.191
you're actively looking.

00:05:45.191 --> 00:05:47.011
You're still part of the labor force.

00:05:47.011 --> 00:05:51.011
But if you've gotten so discouraged
that you're no longer looking for work,

00:05:51.011 --> 00:05:58.655
maybe you've given up, then you
get thrown out of the labor force.

00:05:58.655 --> 00:06:01.390
And that is what most
people don't realize.

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.989
If things get bad enough and
people get really discouraged,

00:06:03.989 --> 00:06:10.122
you have people actually
exiting the entire labor force.

00:06:10.122 --> 00:06:11.855
To see how that affects the numbers,

00:06:11.855 --> 00:06:13.057
imagine a situation.

00:06:13.057 --> 00:06:14.855
So this is the unemployment
rate right now.

00:06:14.855 --> 00:06:17.723
There's 15 million
people who are unemployed

00:06:17.723 --> 00:06:19.512
and actively looking for work.

00:06:19.512 --> 00:06:22.992
Let's say that this is just a
horrible recession or depression

00:06:22.992 --> 00:06:26.791
and five million of these
people get so discouraged

00:06:26.791 --> 00:06:31.456
they don't, in the last four weeks,
they do not look for work anymore.

00:06:31.456 --> 00:06:34.724
So they maybe even stop altogether
or they want to take a break.

00:06:34.724 --> 00:06:37.593
So what we're going to do is we're
going to take five million people

00:06:37.593 --> 00:06:40.057
out of this bucket over here.

00:06:40.057 --> 00:06:42.791
So we're going to take five
million people and move them

00:06:42.791 --> 00:06:46.989
out over here, outside of the labor force.

00:06:46.989 --> 00:06:49.057
If you did that, what happens?

00:06:49.057 --> 00:06:54.593
Well now the official unemployed
number is now going to be 10 million,

00:06:54.593 --> 00:06:56.722
it's now going to be 10 million.

00:06:56.722 --> 00:06:58.456
And what's the labor force number?

00:06:58.456 --> 00:07:01.927
Remember they went completely out
of this green circle over here.

00:07:01.927 --> 00:07:04.011
So they've also left the labor force.

00:07:04.011 --> 00:07:08.454
So the labor force number
is now 149 million.

00:07:08.454 --> 00:07:13.124
So in this bad situation where
people have left the labor force

00:07:13.124 --> 00:07:16.103
the unemployment rate would
now be 10 million people

00:07:16.103 --> 00:07:19.854
unemployed and actively looking
for work over a labor force

00:07:19.854 --> 00:07:25.354
of 149 million, the labor force has
shrunk because they're so discouraged.

00:07:25.354 --> 00:07:27.454
So what do we get there
as our unemployment rate?

00:07:27.454 --> 00:07:36.271
We have 10 divided by 149,
it gives us 6.7 percent.

00:07:36.271 --> 00:07:38.854
So this is fascinating.

00:07:38.854 --> 00:07:43.021
If things get bad enough and people
actually exit the labor force,

00:07:43.021 --> 00:07:48.388
then the unemployment rate could go down
because the labor force is shrinking.

00:07:48.388 --> 00:07:51.653
The other thing could also happen,
maybe things get really good,

00:07:51.653 --> 00:07:55.269
maybe things get really good
and you have 10 million people

00:07:55.269 --> 00:08:01.022
who are sitting out here, they're
either marginally attached workers

00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:04.455
which are people who are hoping
to get a job but haven't looked

00:08:04.455 --> 00:08:07.271
for a job in the past four weeks,
or they could be discouraged workers

00:08:07.271 --> 00:08:09.388
who have altogether, they
wouldn't mind working,

00:08:09.388 --> 00:08:12.187
but they've given up altogether
looking, but you can imagine it

00:08:12.187 --> 00:08:16.021
when the economy gets good, let's say
we're starting from this baseline here,

00:08:16.021 --> 00:08:19.521
when the economy gets good and all
of these people who are unemployed

00:08:19.521 --> 00:08:24.124
but not part of the labor force all
of a sudden start looking for work.

00:08:24.124 --> 00:08:27.189
So then they'd be part of
the official unemployed.

00:08:27.189 --> 00:08:30.187
So this 10 million would
grow to 20 million,

00:08:30.187 --> 00:08:33.322
20 million so now this
number is 20 million

00:08:33.322 --> 00:08:36.272
and this green area would
go up by 10 million.

00:08:36.272 --> 00:08:38.791
So now this would be 159 million.

00:08:38.791 --> 00:08:43.389
So in this situation, the official
unemployed would be 20 million,

00:08:43.389 --> 00:08:47.355
and the entire labor force
would be 159 million,

00:08:47.355 --> 00:08:50.122
and now you would get a situation-

00:08:50.122 --> 00:08:55.188
so you have 20 divided by 159 million,

00:08:55.188 --> 00:08:58.271
which is 12.6 percent.

00:08:58.271 --> 00:09:01.925
12.6 percent, approximately 12.6 percent.

00:09:01.925 --> 00:09:05.353
So the whole point of this video, I'm
not saying that the unemployment rate,

00:09:05.353 --> 00:09:08.603
the way it's calculated is wrong or
that's it supposed to be misleading,

00:09:08.603 --> 00:09:12.055
I just want to give you a little
bit of nuance that it doesn't always

00:09:12.055 --> 00:09:15.124
give the complete picture, in
particular that one number,

00:09:15.124 --> 00:09:18.937
and there's other unemployment rates
that give a little bit more nuance here,

00:09:18.937 --> 00:09:22.655
but this one headline unemployment rate
that is typically given on the news

00:09:22.655 --> 00:09:24.456
doesn't capture the whole story.

00:09:24.456 --> 00:09:28.861
In particular it doesn't
capture the people who might
be exiting the labor force

00:09:28.861 --> 00:09:32.260
when things are bad, so in that
situation the unemployment rate

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.394
would probably be understating
how bad things are,

00:09:35.394 --> 00:09:38.745
and it also doesn't capture the people
who are entering the labor force,

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:41.728
and that situation the unemployment
rate would probably make things

00:09:41.728 --> 00:09:46.000
look worse than they are when
things might actually be improving.
