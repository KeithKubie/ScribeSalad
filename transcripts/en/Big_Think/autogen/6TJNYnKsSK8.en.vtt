you

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:06.520
you
 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.220
you
it seems like you know when we talk

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:08.230
it seems like you know when we talk
 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.830
it seems like you know when we talk
about genius there is a sort of the that

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:10.840
about genius there is a sort of the that
 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.930
about genius there is a sort of the that
that creative capacity that we all have

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:12.940
that creative capacity that we all have
 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.430
that creative capacity that we all have
to some degree but then there is the

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.440
to some degree but then there is the
 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.520
to some degree but then there is the
question of degrees so and do do you

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:17.530
question of degrees so and do do you
 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.620
question of degrees so and do do you
think neuroscience is giving us some

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630
think neuroscience is giving us some
 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.410
think neuroscience is giving us some
answers as to why some people have it

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:22.420
answers as to why some people have it
 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:23.250
answers as to why some people have it
and some people don't

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:23.260
and some people don't
 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.890
and some people don't
well I think neuroscience and genetics

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900
well I think neuroscience and genetics
 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.930
well I think neuroscience and genetics
as well so so recently there's been

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:27.940
as well so so recently there's been
 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.029
as well so so recently there's been
studies looking at like musical talent

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039
studies looking at like musical talent
 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.380
studies looking at like musical talent
and it shows that there's actually a

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390
and it shows that there's actually a
 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.229
and it shows that there's actually a
really large genetic component involved

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239
really large genetic component involved
 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.150
really large genetic component involved
and so I think when we see these people

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160
and so I think when we see these people
 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.120
and so I think when we see these people
who are at the way you know top ends you

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.130
who are at the way you know top ends you
 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.010
who are at the way you know top ends you
know like three standard deviations out

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020
know like three standard deviations out
 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.930
know like three standard deviations out
from the norm you're looking at a

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940
from the norm you're looking at a
 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.150
from the norm you're looking at a
combination between somebody who's born

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160
combination between somebody who's born
 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.130
combination between somebody who's born
with a particular predisposition to have

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140
with a particular predisposition to have
 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.460
with a particular predisposition to have
a talent plus the practice so for you

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470
a talent plus the practice so for you
 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.350
a talent plus the practice so for you
maybe you know you can practice from now

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360
maybe you know you can practice from now
 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.940
maybe you know you can practice from now
until tomorrow and you'll only get to be

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:53.950
until tomorrow and you'll only get to be
 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.250
until tomorrow and you'll only get to be
so good as a concert pianist but if you

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260
so good as a concert pianist but if you
 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.080
so good as a concert pianist but if you
were doing that Plus you had a genetic

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090
were doing that Plus you had a genetic
 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.090
were doing that Plus you had a genetic
predisposition you might get to these

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100
predisposition you might get to these
 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.709
predisposition you might get to these
really far extremes and people might

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719
really far extremes and people might
 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:04.380
really far extremes and people might
call you genius but it's it's it's a

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390
call you genius but it's it's it's a
 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.300
call you genius but it's it's it's a
combination of the two I once went

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310
combination of the two I once went
 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.789
combination of the two I once went
around the world and met these people

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:08.799
around the world and met these people
 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:10.200
around the world and met these people
called superhumans who were like

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210
called superhumans who were like
 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.330
called superhumans who were like
extraordinary in a particular domain

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340
extraordinary in a particular domain
 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.879
extraordinary in a particular domain
like what like for example a person with

00:01:14.879 --> 00:01:14.889
like what like for example a person with
 

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:18.300
like what like for example a person with
an extraordinary memory or who could

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310
an extraordinary memory or who could
 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.429
an extraordinary memory or who could
withstand an enormous amount of pain and

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:20.439
withstand an enormous amount of pain and
 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:21.569
withstand an enormous amount of pain and
there all sorts of these things that are

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:21.579
there all sorts of these things that are
 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:22.919
there all sorts of these things that are
way outside the norm a man who could

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:22.929
way outside the norm a man who could
 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:24.480
way outside the norm a man who could
hold his breath underwater for 22

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490
hold his breath underwater for 22
 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.219
hold his breath underwater for 22
minutes which is actually amazing yeah

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229
minutes which is actually amazing yeah
 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.199
minutes which is actually amazing yeah
and when you look at it and we did

00:01:28.199 --> 00:01:28.209
and when you look at it and we did
 

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:30.269
and when you look at it and we did
experiments on them it's a combination

00:01:30.269 --> 00:01:30.279
experiments on them it's a combination
 

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:32.999
experiments on them it's a combination
of having a different physiology like so

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009
of having a different physiology like so
 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:34.260
of having a different physiology like so
for instance the man who could hold his

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270
for instance the man who could hold his
 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.580
for instance the man who could hold his
breath underwater had a larger lung

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590
breath underwater had a larger lung
 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.739
breath underwater had a larger lung
capacity but then he practiced and

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:37.749
capacity but then he practiced and
 

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:39.059
capacity but then he practiced and
learned meditation learned how to slow

00:01:39.059 --> 00:01:39.069
learned meditation learned how to slow
 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:40.589
learned meditation learned how to slow
his body's metabolism and did all these

00:01:40.589 --> 00:01:40.599
his body's metabolism and did all these
 

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:42.269
his body's metabolism and did all these
other things that led him to hit this

00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:42.279
other things that led him to hit this
 

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:44.160
other things that led him to hit this
extreme it's the same thing with

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170
extreme it's the same thing with
 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.639
extreme it's the same thing with
cognitive capacity so even IQ right it's

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649
cognitive capacity so even IQ right it's
 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.289
cognitive capacity so even IQ right it's
it's it's a measure of different

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299
it's it's a measure of different
 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.139
it's it's a measure of different
cognitive aspects you know reasoning and

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149
cognitive aspects you know reasoning and
 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:57.089
cognitive aspects you know reasoning and
verbal abilities but with practice you

00:01:57.089 --> 00:01:57.099
verbal abilities but with practice you
 

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:59.969
verbal abilities but with practice you
can get to be the best within your

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979
can get to be the best within your
 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.729
can get to be the best within your
biological constraints mm-hmm you know

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:02.739
biological constraints mm-hmm you know
 

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:04.739
biological constraints mm-hmm you know
you hear about genius being associated

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:04.749
you hear about genius being associated
 

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:07.319
you hear about genius being associated
with some of these disorders like

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329
with some of these disorders like
 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.260
with some of these disorders like
schizophrenia obsessive-compulsive

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270
schizophrenia obsessive-compulsive
 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.199
schizophrenia obsessive-compulsive
disorder these these things I mean do

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209
disorder these these things I mean do
 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.720
disorder these these things I mean do
you think that they're interrelated or

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730
you think that they're interrelated or
 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.370
you think that they're interrelated or
do you think at the very least we could

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380
do you think at the very least we could
 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.200
do you think at the very least we could
learn something about genius from

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210
learn something about genius from
 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.960
learn something about genius from
looking

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970
looking
 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.760
looking
people who are dealing with these

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770
people who are dealing with these
 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.010
people who are dealing with these
disorders so yeah I mean there's a lot

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020
disorders so yeah I mean there's a lot
 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.560
disorders so yeah I mean there's a lot
of controversy a controversy in this

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570
of controversy a controversy in this
 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.730
of controversy a controversy in this
area because it's not necessary to have

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740
area because it's not necessary to have
 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.190
area because it's not necessary to have
some sort of you know psychopathology in

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200
some sort of you know psychopathology in
 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.930
some sort of you know psychopathology in
order to be a genius and a lot of people

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940
order to be a genius and a lot of people
 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.240
order to be a genius and a lot of people
conflate these two ideas like the mad

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250
conflate these two ideas like the mad
 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.450
conflate these two ideas like the mad
genius and it happens that yeah there

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460
genius and it happens that yeah there
 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.410
genius and it happens that yeah there
are a lot of people who are very

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420
are a lot of people who are very
 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.060
are a lot of people who are very
talented who also happen to have a

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070
talented who also happen to have a
 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.240
talented who also happen to have a
mental disorder a lot of the mental

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250
mental disorder a lot of the mental
 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.220
mental disorder a lot of the mental
disorders are initially things that are

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230
disorders are initially things that are
 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.740
disorders are initially things that are
adaptive like even OCD you know it's

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750
adaptive like even OCD you know it's
 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.590
adaptive like even OCD you know it's
good to sort of have structure and have

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600
good to sort of have structure and have
 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.300
good to sort of have structure and have
certain rituals but when it gets to be

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310
certain rituals but when it gets to be
 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.490
certain rituals but when it gets to be
extreme then it becomes problematic so

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500
extreme then it becomes problematic so
 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.660
extreme then it becomes problematic so
these are things that we all have that

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670
these are things that we all have that
 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.540
these are things that we all have that
are adaptive that sometimes go a little

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550
are adaptive that sometimes go a little
 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.180
are adaptive that sometimes go a little
too far extreme it doesn't necessarily

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190
too far extreme it doesn't necessarily
 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.100
too far extreme it doesn't necessarily
mean that that correlates with

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110
mean that that correlates with
 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.830
mean that that correlates with
creativity however if you do think about

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840
creativity however if you do think about
 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.900
creativity however if you do think about
it something like OCD where you're

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910
it something like OCD where you're
 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.180
it something like OCD where you're
really a certain type of OCD where

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190
really a certain type of OCD where
 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.470
really a certain type of OCD where
you're really paying attention to the

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480
you're really paying attention to the
 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.630
you're really paying attention to the
detail might allow you to put in the

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640
detail might allow you to put in the
 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.850
detail might allow you to put in the
hours to you know for example like

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860
hours to you know for example like
 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.620
hours to you know for example like
Darwin to obsessively collect all of

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630
Darwin to obsessively collect all of
 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.900
Darwin to obsessively collect all of
these things but that in itself is not

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910
these things but that in itself is not
 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.320
these things but that in itself is not
enough he also I think needed the

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330
enough he also I think needed the
 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.759
enough he also I think needed the
divergent thinking the creative thinking

quirks and you know no two brains are
 

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.530

exactly the same so I think it really
 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.200
exactly the same so I think it really
