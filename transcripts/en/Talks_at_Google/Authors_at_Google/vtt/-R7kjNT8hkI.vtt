BORIS: Welcome, everyone.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.550
It's another Authors
at Google Talk.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.800
Today with us is Sir
Lawrence Freedman.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.930
He's been a professor
of war studies

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.320
at King's College London
since 1982 and vice principal

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.470
since 2003, elected a fellow
of the British Academy in 1995

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.410
and awarded the CVE in 1996.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.230
He was appointed official
historian of the Faulklands

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.910
campaign in 1997.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.350
He was awarded the KCMG in 2003.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.250
In June, 2009, he was
appointed to serve

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.290
as a member of the
official inquiry

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.950
into Britain and
the 2003 Iraq war.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.815
Professor Freedman has
written extensively

00:00:47.815 --> 00:00:50.680
on nuclear strategy
and the Cold War,

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.430
as well as
commentating regularly

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.420
on contemporary security issues.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.950
His recent book, "A
Choice of Enemies,

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.000
America Confronts
the Middle East,"

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.245
won the 2009 Lionel Gelber prize
and Duke of Westminster metal

00:01:06.245 --> 00:01:09.310
for military literature.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.930
Today he will talk us through
his newest book, "Strategy,

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.660
a History."

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.631
Please give a warm welcome
to Sir Lawrence Freedman.

00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:21.577
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:21.577 --> 00:01:23.800
SIR LAWRENCE FREEDMAN:
Boris, thank you very much.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.950
It's a real pleasure to be here.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.070
Everybody here
Googles regularly.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.040
So to actually be at the
heart of it is quite exciting.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.620
So what I want to do
first is to explain to you

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.950
what the book is about
and how it's organized

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.810
and then give you some
basic ideas about some

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.375
of the main themes
before trying out on you

00:01:53.375 --> 00:01:58.460
an approach to strategy which
I think emerges from the book.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.922
I have to emphasize
that, because I'd

00:02:01.922 --> 00:02:03.380
like you to read
it, but it doesn't

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.490
depend on you agreeing with
the approach to strategy.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.612
But I do think if you're going
to write about these things,

00:02:10.612 --> 00:02:12.570
you should have some
ideas at the end about it.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.960
The book is essentially
a history of ideas.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.820
So it has quite a lot of the
different theories, which

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.520
I think impinge on strategy and
make people think differently

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.100
about it.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.880
And it's about the relationship
between theory and practice,

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.140
about how ideas about
action are influenced

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.960
by views about how
the world works.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.260
So that's sort of what
inspired me to do it.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.440
It isn't really a
how to do it book.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.330
It's not a book that
the inspiration of which

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.180
was 20 lessons to success.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.230
If you just follow my
example, you'll make a mint.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.200
You won't if you try
to follow what I say.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.500
But it gives you some ideas.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.420
So the way it's organizes
is sort of first

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.010
looking at the pre-history
of strategy in the sense

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.190
that the word, as
we understand it,

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.070
came into use largely at the
end of the 18th century, start

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.730
of the 19th century.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.040
The word itself comes
from the Greek strategos,

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.450
the art of the general.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.350
And, of course, a lot of the
activity that we would now

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.554
describe as being strategic
was there before hand.

00:03:28.554 --> 00:03:29.970
Just because people
didn't call it

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.710
strategy doesn't mean to say
that they weren't doing it.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.160
But the word itself, and
therefore the interest

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.930
in what it's about
and how to define it,

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.520
how to conceptualize
it, comes into currency

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.290
just before Napoleon.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.440
But I think Napoleon
gives it more meaning

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.620
to those who are interested
in how the art of warfare

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.290
had been transformed since
the French Revolution.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.120
But it was part of
the Enlightenment

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.730
because it captured
the idea that

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.955
with sufficient application
of reason and science,

00:04:08.955 --> 00:04:10.960
that the world could
become much more

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.110
comprehensible and predictable,
and therefore controllable.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.170
And there's an impulse
behind strategy.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.000
It's a desire to make the
future more in your control,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.130
more so in control
than other people

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.600
with whom you may be in
competition or in war.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.240
And the assumption is that
if you understand that world

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.640
better than they do and can work
out your actions accordingly,

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.630
you're the one who
will come out on top.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.360
So it reflected an
enlightenment belief

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.770
that it was possible to get
a science of human affairs

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:53.220
that would be following
the natural sciences.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.170
Napoleon gave it
much more meaning

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.680
because here was
somebody who seemed

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.540
to have a genius for
battle, for transforming

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.270
the way that war was fought.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.350
And two of those who fought
in the Napoleonic Wars,

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.580
not on the same side--
the Swiss Germany

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.900
and the Prussian Clausewitz--
I became the main interpreters

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.720
of Napoleon through
the 19th century

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.590
and influenced the way
that we think about,

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.810
not only war, but also
strategy ever since.

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.330
And the basic point that
they sought to get over--

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.990
and Clausewitz is
much more nuanced

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.640
and settled than
Germany in this.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.690
But the underlying
point was the same.

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.870
The efforts of the
great general would

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.550
be geared towards
the decisive battle.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.050
And the decisiveness of battle
was really important in this.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.330
It wasn't just winning.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.680
You would win in such a way
that the opponent, the enemy,

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.130
would be at your mercy.

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:03.200
And so the politics
of the conflict

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.120
would be sorted out by
the military victory,

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.860
by the military success.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.140
So the idea of decisive battle--
which is not a new idea,

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:16.570
but was given much more
credibility by Napoleon's

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.370
early successes--
was to the full.

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:24.000
If you won the battle,
you would win the war.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.840
Now the problem
with this became--

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.630
could have been
apparent at the time.

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:35.670
There was one campaign where
both Germany and Clausewitz

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:40.370
were present, which is the
1812 campaign against Russia

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.690
on opposite sides.

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.640
And that showed a
lot of the problems

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.120
with the idea of
decisive battle.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.110
Napoleon won at the
Battle at Borodino.

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.460
But he didn't really win
because the Russians had

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.900
sufficient reserves left--
as the Russians always

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.710
do-- had sufficient
reserves left

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.750
to be able to mount
another attack.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.780
Napoleon went for
the capital city

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.040
to find it abandoned
and soon on fire

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.780
and discovered he was stranded.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.980
He didn't actually have
a way of winning the war

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.560
and famously then
had to retreat.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:23.310
You could argue also that
the Peninsula War, where

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:28.380
the first guerrillas made their
appearance-- or the first that

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.510
were called that in
Spain-- also demonstrated

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:33.920
in the face of
popular resistance,

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.990
even if an army
had been defeated,

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:39.020
you could also struggle.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.980
So the problems with the
idea of a decisive battle,

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:46.010
in principle, were evident
right from the start.

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:50.400
Nonetheless, to this
day, military strategy

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:54.740
seems to be geared to
that particular event.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:58.310
Yet if you look at the
developments in technology

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:01.400
over the past couple
of hundred years,

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.670
you realize just
how much harder it

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:10.500
is to get a decisive victory
than it was in Napoleon's day.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.680
The range of weapons, their
lethality, their numbers,

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.440
the ways in which you
could bring reserves

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.640
to the battlefield
through railways,

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.170
the development of aircraft,
and so on, all of these

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:28.840
made warfare much
more challenging

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:32.429
and much more likely
to end in attrition,

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:37.960
a long battle, a
long struggle that

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:41.650
would not have an easy answer.

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:46.030
One side would eventually
be basically worn down

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:47.920
by the other, in
which case it would

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.020
be just the superiority
of resources

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.830
that would make the difference.

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.640
I mean, we're
happy to talk later

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.100
about various ideas
that have developed

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.450
over the last couple of
decades under the influence

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:07.490
of the digital revolution about
how military affairs might

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:09.380
be affected by this.

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.280
But essentially
if you're talking

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:16.000
about wars between great powers,
especially nuclear powers,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.640
it's very hard to see
how they can be concluded

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.000
with the abject surrender
of one to the other,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.360
especially if both have
got nuclear weapons, hence

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.300
the phrase mutually
assured destruction,

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:33.060
which is very explicit
about the state of affairs.

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:38.200
That warns of the consequences
of two sides trying

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.200
to fight to the finish.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.420
And my experience
warns of the problems

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:46.610
of believing that
through clever strategy

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:50.640
you can control affairs because
there's always something

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:54.710
else to come behind.

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:58.830
The next session looks
at political affairs.

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:01.350
And I start with the
underdog, for reasons

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:02.840
I'll explain in a minute.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:06.510
I start with revolutionary
theory, largely

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:09.580
revolutionaries, because the
gap between where they start

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:12.812
and where they're going, where
we wish to end up, is enormous.

00:10:12.812 --> 00:10:14.520
They're the ones who
think about strategy

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.920
more than anybody else.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.560
It's often pretty
hopeless and futile.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.960
But they do think
a lot about it.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:22.780
Anybody who's had any
connection with radical groups

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:26.550
will know just how much
strategizing goes on, often

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:27.620
to little effect.

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:30.780
But in the 1830's, when
the first professional

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:33.280
revolutionaries
came along, they had

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.560
an example not very long before
of the French Revolution, which

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.730
indicated how things could
change, and a lot of unrest

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:44.820
and unsettled
popular feeling that

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:48.741
gave them hope that things
could be transformed.

00:10:48.741 --> 00:10:51.240
And a lot of the ideas that we
have now become very familiar

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:55.250
with, of course, were very
fresh in those terms about how

00:10:55.250 --> 00:11:01.270
society may develop and
the science of politics

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:02.410
that Marx in particular.

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:04.140
But others also
thought that they

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:09.480
had discerned that would
explain why in some way or other

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.010
their victory was inevitable.

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:15.860
And they also were looking
for a decisive event

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:17.880
just like the
military strategists.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.654
In their case the
decisive event was

00:11:20.654 --> 00:11:23.070
going to be the revolution,
which would be the moment when

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:26.350
you move from one political
order to the next.

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:30.022
And, of course, with
the revolutionaries,

00:11:30.022 --> 00:11:32.230
they didn't have much chance
to put it into practice.

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:35.850
When there were revolutions,
for example in 1917,

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:38.970
they didn't occur in anything
like the circumstances

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:41.320
in which the revolutionaries
had predicted.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.200
Their methods were
different to those

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.300
that they had said
that they would follow.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.020
And then, of course, they were
faced with the many challenges

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:52.110
of coping with the society
that they'd inherited.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:53.990
But what I try to
do in the book is

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:57.630
look through the ways in
which the frustrations

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:00.940
of the revolutionaries
led to new thinking

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:05.060
about political action, and
in particular the importance

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:09.910
of the way that people
think about their situation

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:13.135
as being what you have to
influence and manipulate.

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.640
Why was it that the
masses didn't understand

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:23.820
how repressed and oppressed
and exploited they were?

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:26.870
What were the sources of
their false consciousness?

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:29.790
And as those ideas
developed, they

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:32.290
merged into much
more general thinking

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:37.310
about how people construct
the world in their heads

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:39.150
and the challenges
of influencing

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:40.750
those constructions.

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:48.120
So as you move on, you see
within political affairs, quite

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.400
mainstream now, not
particularly radical,

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:54.970
the idea of the narrative taking
hold, that what's critical

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:58.730
is your ability to frame
events in such a way

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:02.680
that people will accept your
version of what's going on

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.320
and act accordingly.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.520
So the narrative
becomes increasingly

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.340
important to strategy.

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:10.090
And you can argue
something similar

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:11.790
is happening, the
influence by some

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:15.200
of these ideas in political
affairs in the military affairs

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:15.870
as well.

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:18.520
In counter insurgency
theory, the importance

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.950
of hearts and minds as
opposed to just beating people

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:25.711
up, so-called kinetic methods.

00:13:25.711 --> 00:13:30.440
The importance of hearts and
minds lies in the recognition

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.535
that the way people
think about a conflict,

00:13:32.535 --> 00:13:34.360
not necessarily
that they like you,

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.080
but if they think
you're going to win

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.705
and maybe that it's going to
be better for you if they do,

00:13:38.705 --> 00:13:42.200
it may well, again, affect
their readiness to give support

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:48.770
to insurgents, provide recruits
to insurgents, fund them,

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:50.820
or whatever else they might do.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:56.450
And similarly also in
the business sphere,

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:59.030
if you look at the
literature now,

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:01.930
business strategy is
the dominant field.

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:05.110
There's more books written
about business strategy

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:08.910
and all the bits of the business
strategy, human relations,

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:11.260
procurement,
marketing, whatever,

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.500
than there are about
military strategy.

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.300
It only really
started-- you only

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:19.040
see books on business
strategy coming

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.190
into being in the early '60s.

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:25.940
It has a similar sort
of origin, however.

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:29.220
Just like military
strategy was initially

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:32.200
about the affairs
of the great powers,

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.810
so it is business strategy
was about the affairs

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:38.580
of the great companies, the
big American corporations,

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:43.030
whose actual ability
to grow their business

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:46.210
was limited by antitrust laws.

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:50.790
And they, by and large, were
not doubting their market share.

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:53.770
The question for them
was profitability

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:55.640
and how do they get
the most efficiency out

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:56.590
of their business.

00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:59.110
So a lot of the original
work on business strategy

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:01.960
was looking at the
structure of organizations

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.340
to make sure that they were
at their most efficient.

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:07.690
The word competition
didn't particularly appear.

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:12.925
It was only towards
as the '60s wore on

00:15:12.925 --> 00:15:16.230
that the idea of competitive
strategy in business

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:19.510
became more and more important.

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:26.110
And even then, initially, a
lot of it was-- for example,

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:29.375
the work of Michael Porter--
some of you may be aware of,

00:15:29.375 --> 00:15:34.150
at Harvard, one the first
serious academic business

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:38.900
strategists-- was essentially
about maintaining your market

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:44.830
position and
repelling insurgents

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:47.880
in the sense of putting
up market barriers

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:51.750
rather than necessarily
making better products.

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:55.130
Over the ensuing
period, a lot more

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:58.690
interest in innovation,
finding new markets,

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:02.280
showing how you can be
cleverer than everybody else.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:05.180
But there's been a problem
with business strategy

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:08.990
in that it hasn't really,
unlike military strategy,

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:14.505
had a single compelling model
that has shaped all discussion.

00:16:14.505 --> 00:16:20.590
There's numerous different
strategies on offer.

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:22.950
I was fascinated to discover
whole academic literature

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:26.750
on fads and fashions,
which charted the rise

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:31.080
and fall of a variety of
ideas, often initiated

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:37.050
by Tom Peters, that grabbed
attention for a few years

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:39.050
and then were supplanted
by something else

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:42.850
and raised interesting questions
about why did chief executives

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:46.390
follow these strategies when
experience should warn them

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:49.520
that they may have
a short shelf life

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:52.290
and not produce the
promised rewards?

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:57.120
And there's sort of
interesting answers in terms

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.660
of if everybody
else is following it

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.480
then you don't lose out
by following it yourself.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.839
Indeed, following the
latest fashions often

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:09.810
was associated with higher
executive pay, if not

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:11.150
better results.

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:14.180
So there's an
interesting question

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:18.990
about the development
of business strategy

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:24.530
in that its often
struggled to find its way.

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:31.180
So with that very
quick background

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:34.920
as to how the different
elements-- and I should say,

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.810
the book ends with
more social sciences

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:43.640
stuff about rational choice and
attempts by social scientists

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:46.790
to also provide a scientific
approach to strategy

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:49.000
and what I think is the
interesting influence

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.930
of cognitive psychology
on these ideas.

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:56.440
That's very briefly an
overview of a very long book.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:04.190
Let me give you now my sense
of the approach that I think

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:06.560
comes out of this.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:11.200
One of the things
I'm trying to argue,

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.150
as you will have
gathered, is the attempts

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:16.900
to control the environment
well into the future

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.820
so that you're sure
that where you start,

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:23.280
that by following your strategy
you will reach the desired end,

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:27.920
is often disappointing
and misleading,

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:31.770
that strategy is not
necessarily a plan.

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:34.620
I challenge the idea
that strategy is a plan.

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:39.837
Now, there's a very famous quote
by the great Prussian Field

00:18:39.837 --> 00:18:44.990
Marshal von Moltke that
"no plan survives contact

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:45.920
with the enemy."

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:49.230
I open the book with
my favorite quote which

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:51.460
gets to the same point
in a more pithy way

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:53.990
by the boxer Mike Tyson
which is "everybody's

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:58.450
got a plan until they
got punched in the face."

00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:06.040
And the reason why
plans aren't followed

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.940
is for a very simple reason.

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:10.190
It's a difference in the
way between an engineering

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:12.530
problem and a strategic problem.

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:16.706
If you're dealing with physical
properties as a well known,

00:19:16.706 --> 00:19:18.830
you may have to struggle,
there may be uncertainty,

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:22.460
but you should be able
to get, eventually,

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:27.420
through experimentation and
clever thought, to an outcome.

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:29.350
With a strategic
problem, you've got

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:32.000
somebody trying
to frustrate you.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.230
An example I use is President
Reagan's strategic defense

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:43.170
initiative in the
1980s where he said,

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:47.400
understandably, isn't it better
to protect against a missile

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:50.480
attack than avenge
a missile attack?

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.330
We should be able to protect
against a missile attack

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:55.580
because look how good we are.

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:56.770
We put a man on the moon.

00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:59.550
But, of course, the moon
wasn't trying to fight back.

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:02.817
The moon wasn't trying
to repel borders.

00:20:02.817 --> 00:20:04.150
And that's the basic difference.

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:07.530
You're dealing with an
intelligent opponent.

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:11.640
Now, if you're very
strong, then you

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:16.390
should be able to get your
way in many situations.

00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:19.996
There's a quote
from Ecclesiastes

00:20:19.996 --> 00:20:24.830
that "the race doesn't always go
to the most swift or the fight

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:26.230
to the most strong."

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:30.240
But Damon Runyon added,
"they're the ones to bet on."

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:34.892
By and large the fast
win, and the strong win.

00:20:34.892 --> 00:20:36.600
So the interesting
things about strategy,

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:39.680
which is why I looked so much
at revolutionary strategy,

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:44.540
is under what circumstances
can the underdogs do well?

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:51.670
Now, one answer to
that comes from being

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:55.100
cleverer than the sort
of muscle bound opponent

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:56.990
that you may face.

00:20:56.990 --> 00:21:02.290
And the example that's
often used for that

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:05.840
is David and Goliath.

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:08.740
Every time somebody
sees themselves

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:12.550
as the underdog, the
weak guy in the fight,

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:16.380
they will cite David and
Goliath to give them hope

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:18.790
and to show that they're
also on the side of right.

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:20.730
You know the story
of David and Goliath

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:26.740
with the Philistines
offering their champion

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:31.825
to challenge the Israelites who
don't come up with a champion.

00:21:31.825 --> 00:21:33.950
And that's actually one
important part of the story

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:35.740
because it should
have been King Saul.

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:36.850
That was his job.

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:38.540
That was why he'd
been made king.

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:41.930
But he was very cautious,
and a bit reluctant

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:45.910
so bizarrely accepted the
claims of a shepherd boy

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:49.040
to go on instead.

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:54.320
And this was a shepherd boy who
refused to accept Saul's armor.

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:58.060
So he went undefended
against this giant.

00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:01.060
Instead he picked up some
stones from the stream,

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:09.210
used his sling, and sent them
in the direction of Goliath,

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:10.460
hit him in between the head.

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:11.490
Goliath falls down.

00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:16.380
He chops of his head
with Goliath's own sword.

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:19.430
And the Philistines agree.

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:22.560
Now, the interesting
thing about all of this

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:25.102
is it could've been different.

00:22:25.102 --> 00:22:26.810
And the ways it could
have been different

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:32.460
gives you a warning about
an underdog strategy that

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:37.090
tries to work through deception
and getting in the first blow.

00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:39.600
First, this could have been
a couple of centimeters.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.480
This could have
been very different.

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:44.700
If the thing had pinged off
the top of Goliath's helmet,

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:47.120
he wouldn't have
had a second chance.

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:50.760
He had one chance
and one chance alone.

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:55.790
Secondly, that it
required the Philistines

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:58.190
to accept this result.

00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:00.030
If they thought this
was really unfair--

00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:02.250
this was asymmetric
warfare, after all.

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:06.274
If they thought this was unfair,
they could've rushed forward,

00:23:06.274 --> 00:23:08.440
and the Israelites would
still have been in trouble.

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:14.280
And third, and most
relevant, is that you

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:17.370
can't do this over
and over again.

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:22.060
The next time a champion of
the Philistines came along,

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:24.240
he would at least
have a better helmet.

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:27.450
And he'd certainly be
looking quite carefully

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:29.480
at what David was up to.

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:32.400
And it's the problem of the
trickster through the ages.

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.530
If you look at
Odysseus, who I spent

00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:37.834
some time on in the early
stages of the book, who

00:23:37.834 --> 00:23:40.000
was the great trickster and
a really successful one.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.850
And Homer really
approves of doing things

00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:45.010
by guile rather than force.

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:48.190
But he's not believed
after a point.

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:50.610
Nobody trusts him at all.

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:53.720
Even when he's telling the
truth, he's not believed.

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:57.400
So there are limits
on what you can

00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.360
do by cunning and deception.

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:01.320
Not to say it
can't be successful

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.940
in particular circumstances.

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:04.120
It may be very successful.

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:05.490
But there are limits.

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:07.610
And you can see that
in military terms,

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:11.830
for example, with
the Schlieffen Plan.

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:13.590
You'll be hearing
more about it as we

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:16.050
go through the anniversary of
the start of the first World

00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:17.560
War next year.

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:21.430
But it's the German plan
to take France quickly out

00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:24.350
of war with a knockout blow.

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:26.300
And once they failed
in the knockout blow,

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:28.450
they were stuck with
a war of attrition.

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:30.510
Now the great book
for those who want

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:32.640
to be cleverer
than their opponent

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:37.810
is the Chinese
sage Sun Tzu, which

00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:41.270
is a very good read,
very interesting.

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:43.460
It wasn't very
specific, which is

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:46.200
why it stood the test of
time, lots of aphorisms.

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:50.690
And the basic idea is to
be a better intelligence

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:53.667
than the opponent
and to deceive them.

00:24:53.667 --> 00:24:56.000
If the enemy things you're
strong, you show you're weak.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.333
If the enemy thinks you're
weak, you show you're strong.

00:24:58.333 --> 00:25:01.340
If the enemy thinks you're
retreating, you advance.

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:04.570
The enemy thinks you're
advancing-- you get the idea.

00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:06.822
And you can always make up
some of these aphorisms.

00:25:06.822 --> 00:25:08.030
There's more to it than that.

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:11.630
But the basic idea
and the reason

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:15.440
why it's so appealing
to people is

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.630
that it plays in
some ways to vanity,

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:20.820
that if you could be
cleverer than others--

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:22.600
and who doesn't want
to think that they're

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:25.460
clever than others--
that you could win.

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:27.180
But the problem
comes, obviously,

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:30.140
when you face an opponent
whose got more resources

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:34.301
and is as clever or
indeed clever then you.

00:25:34.301 --> 00:25:38.220
If everybody's read Sun Tzu,
it's not altogether clear

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:40.180
how you'll ever engage
because everybody's

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:44.410
going to be deceiving
each other so much.

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:47.440
You end up with
total disorientation.

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:54.250
But Sun Tzu, because it warns
of the dangers of direct attack,

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:56.990
encourages indirect
approaches, has

00:25:56.990 --> 00:26:02.740
been taken as the
Bible of those who

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:11.320
want to try to achieve great
results without too much pain.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.160
So it's beloved in the
business community.

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:17.830
My favorite moment
with Sun Tzu is

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:22.090
in the episode of the "Sopranos"
where Dr. Melfi is saying

00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:26.950
to Tony Soprano, listen,
don't come to me.

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:29.340
If you want to be a
better strategist,

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:31.270
go read the art of war.

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:33.270
And then a few weeks
later, he comes back out.

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:34.270
I read the "Art of War."

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:36.420
It's better than Machiavelli.

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:40.600
And immediately Amazon sales of
Sun Tzu shot up in New Jersey.

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:46.780
So it's an attractive book.

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:50.279
But I think there are
limits on what it can offer,

00:26:50.279 --> 00:26:52.320
which is heresy, I should
say, to a lot of people

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.400
in the strategy business.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.000
So what's a different approach?

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.730
Well, for a
different approach is

00:26:57.730 --> 00:27:05.710
where I start the book, which
is with primates, with chimps.

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:08.080
We talked about Antwerp before.

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:11.120
At Antwerp Zoo there's a
chap called Frans de Waal

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:15.760
in the 1970s who stood
day after day watching

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:16.745
chimpanzee communities.

00:27:16.745 --> 00:27:20.780
And he wrote a book about it
call "Chimpanzee Politics."

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:23.420
And what he realized is
that when the alpha male,

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:27.140
the big strong leader of the
pack, was being challenged,

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:31.430
it wasn't by somebody who
was bigger and stronger.

00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:35.200
But actually the challengers
were often quite clever.

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.450
They did use deception.

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:39.060
But they also formed coalitions.

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:41.530
They found partners.

00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:48.890
And that's a pretty good way to
challenge a stronger opponent.

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:52.250
Find somebody, and get
stronger than they are.

00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:55.870
And that's what the chimps did.

00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:58.910
And the other thing that
studies of chimps showed

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:02.010
is that they did go to war.

00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:05.690
And usually for
animals, they were

00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:09.140
prepared to kill their own
species as a deliberate attack.

00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:11.661
It wasn't out of
emotion or anger.

00:28:11.661 --> 00:28:12.660
It was quite deliberate.

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:16.890
And we know it's
deliberate because they

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:21.300
would tend to try to, again,
have superiority in numbers

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:22.540
if they mounted an attack.

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:26.320
And if they didn't have a
superiority, they slunk away.

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:29.650
And I think that also points
to an important lesson, which

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:32.890
is the importance of endurance.

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:35.120
Actually, rather than
go for a swift knockout

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:38.310
blow, if your weaker,
often the first thing to do

00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:42.640
is to survive and endure until
you find the point at which you

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:44.990
can gain strength
from partnerships

00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:46.590
or because something
else has happened

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:50.880
which allows you to move in.

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:53.790
So the lessons-- and
I argue that these

00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:56.750
are elemental and can
be taken all the way

00:28:56.750 --> 00:29:00.570
through-- our the
importance of endurance,

00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:03.800
the importance of
coalitions, and actually

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:07.270
to make coalitions
work if you are

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:10.502
going to deceive an opponent,
the importance of empathy.

00:29:10.502 --> 00:29:12.210
And you don't necessarily
think of chimps

00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:14.700
as being especially empathetic.

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:17.040
But what that meant
was that they have what

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:19.710
biologists called a
theory of the mind

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:25.500
so that they understood that the
way another individual behaved

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:29.910
depended upon the way
that they thought.

00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:33.460
And so you get back to this--
in a sense, again, not a thing

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:35.420
you'd associate with
a chimp, a narrative.

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:38.330
But you get back to the idea
that the way that the world is

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:41.260
constructed is very important
to understand behavior.

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:45.730
And if you can change that,
you can change behavior.

00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:51.470
And just to give you an
example of leaping forward,

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:54.680
so it's from chimps to
Churchill, when Winston

00:29:54.680 --> 00:30:01.140
Churchill became prime
minister in 1940, in May 1940,

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:04.610
the issue that he
faced at the time

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:08.276
was not how Britain could
beat Germany war because all

00:30:08.276 --> 00:30:09.900
Britain's allies, [?
and our ?] allies,

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:13.170
they were all being swept
away by the Nazi advance,

00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:15.740
by the blitzkrieg.

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:18.930
And the issue was Britain
finding itself alone.

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:21.090
And the question was
should they attempt

00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:24.970
to negotiate peace with Hitler?

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:29.790
And he concluded no and
persuaded his colleagues--

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:32.530
it was quite a serious
debate in the Cabinet--

00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:34.240
that they should not.

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:36.350
Not because he ruled
it out in the future,

00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:38.230
but he didn't need
to at the time.

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:41.830
They could endure and
survive for the moment.

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:43.590
And then they would
have to review.

00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:47.740
So in the first instance-- and
this is true of much strategy.

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:49.240
Because a lot of
strategy is written

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:51.730
as if you're on the
offensive from word go.

00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:54.000
And it's about
winning and beating.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.560
Actually a lot of strategy
is about survival.

00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:01.150
It's about circumstances in
which you're under challenge,

00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:04.359
and you're trying to
work out, often in part

00:31:04.359 --> 00:31:05.900
from a very good
position, how you're

00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:08.890
moving into a weak position.

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:10.400
So that was just
Churchill starting.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.880
But Churchill did
have a view about how

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.010
victory might come eventually.

00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:16.880
And it was quite
different from the view

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:20.700
of his predecessor,
Neville Chamberlain.

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:25.130
And that was that the key
was the United States.

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:27.260
He immediately set
up a correspondence

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:30.240
with President
Roosevelt with the view

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:34.210
all the time to persuade
the United States to provide

00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:40.050
the British Empire with help
and eventually hopefully coming

00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:40.880
into the war.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:44.170
So when, on the 7th
of December, 1941,

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:47.620
the Americans were in the
war, helped the next day

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:55.170
by Hitler's own declaration
of war on the United States,

00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:57.620
one of many strange
moves, in retrospect,

00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:03.470
made by Hitler-- the
Japanese didn't reciprocate.

00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:06.890
The Japanese declared
war on the United States,

00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:10.390
but they didn't declare
war on Russia, for example.

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:12.830
But anyway, Hitler declared
war on the United States.

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:16.010
And Churchill's
comment, recollection,

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:21.820
was "so we had won at last."

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:24.270
We would survive.

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:27.590
Now, there were years to
go before the war was over.

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:30.000
But he now knew the
balance had shifted.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.890
And, of course,
even before that,

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:36.290
it indicated Russia, Soviet
Union, had come into the war.

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:38.850
And when that
happened, Churchill

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:41.835
was chided for forming
an alliance with Stalin

00:32:41.835 --> 00:32:45.100
because Churchill had been
a great anti-Bolsheviker,

00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:47.530
an opponent of the Soviet Union.

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:50.760
And his comment was, if
Hitler invaded Hades,

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:54.640
I'd say a good word for Satan
in the House of Commons.

00:32:54.640 --> 00:33:00.760
So he understood from the start
the importance of coalition.

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:07.770
So what then-- just to sort
of pull this together--

00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:08.800
am I arguing?

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:09.930
I've argued coalition.

00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:12.820
I've argued often
the starting point

00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:16.290
is defensive rather
than offensive.

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:18.480
And that leads, I
think, to a challenge

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:23.220
to the idea, which is very
strong in the literature,

00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:28.020
that strategy is about
setting your objectives

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:30.664
and working out how
to achieve them.

00:33:30.664 --> 00:33:32.080
It's always about
the relationship

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:33.330
between ends and means.

00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:37.500
But somehow the ends define
what you're trying to do.

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:39.460
And I think it's understandable.

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:42.630
And sometimes it's fine
because you can set objectives,

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:46.660
and you can see a way forward
with a plan to achieve them.

00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:50.080
But there are two reasons
for caution in that.

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:56.000
First, actually in
practice, strategies

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:01.050
are set by the problems you
face in the here and now.

00:34:01.050 --> 00:34:05.020
Strategy is not about getting
to an ultimate objective.

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:08.250
Strategy is about
getting to a better place

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:11.699
than you would be
without strategy.

00:34:11.699 --> 00:34:13.980
And that may be
quite short term.

00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:15.440
It may be a longer term.

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:20.350
But the initial objectives
are unlikely to be

00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:21.860
ultimate objectives.

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:27.940
They're going to be what you can
do to get yourself to address

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:30.290
the problems you
face at the moment.

00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:32.590
That is what most
strategy, in practice,

00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:36.080
is about, never mind what
the strategy books may say.

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:40.679
The second reason why it's
important not to get fixated

00:34:40.679 --> 00:34:45.780
on the ultimate objective is
actually in life there isn't.

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:48.689
You rarely reach an
ultimate objective.

00:34:48.689 --> 00:34:51.760
And it goes back to the
problem of the decisive battle

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.940
or the decisive revolution.

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:58.050
They're decisive
only to a point.

00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:01.680
You win a battle.

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:03.094
The enemy surrenders.

00:35:03.094 --> 00:35:05.260
But then you've got a whole
series of other problems

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:08.390
to face about working the peace.

00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:10.350
You win an election.

00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:12.930
You find yourself in government.

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:15.330
You have a successful takeover.

00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:20.810
You've now got to work out to
merge one company into another.

00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:23.320
You have a revolution.

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:25.440
The regime is overthrown.

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:27.640
But somehow you've
got to govern.

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:31.200
So strategy doesn't stop.

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:34.140
It's not a three act play.

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:36.870
It's a soap opera.

00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:38.650
You get to one stage,
and then there's

00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:43.030
another stage, and
a stage after that.

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:47.930
It's a permanent part
of human activity.

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:53.860
So the approach that I'm
arguing for at the end

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:59.830
is based on getting away
from the idea of a plan

00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:04.290
with a definite end and
thinking more about strategy

00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:08.780
as a response to a changing
environment, which is throwing

00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:14.090
up new problems which requires
you to think through what you

00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:17.874
can do to get yourself into a
better position, at which point

00:36:17.874 --> 00:36:19.290
you'll be thinking
again about how

00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:21.210
to get to an even
better position.

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:25.260
As you move, new
possibilities open up

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:30.150
and other possibilities
may be closed down.

00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:32.520
So it's very rarely
the case, when

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:38.330
you embark on a great campaign,
the you'll end up in the place

00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:40.850
where you hoped to be
or even expected to be.

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:41.910
Things happen.

00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:46.120
There are questions of
chance, of serendipity

00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:49.080
that will make a difference.

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:56.750
So to conclude, what I hope
people will get from this book

00:36:56.750 --> 00:37:01.530
is first a sense of the
many, many different ways

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:03.710
that people have
thought about strategy

00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:06.660
and talked about strategy.

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:13.600
I hope you'll get a sense of the
importance of political theory,

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:16.870
the big ideas of
the time in shaping

00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:20.590
how people act and
address their affairs.

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:24.410
And I hope that it'll also
make people a little bit

00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:28.940
cautious about the
claims of strategists.

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:32.670
As Eisenhower has said about
plans, "plans are useless,

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:34.340
but planning is essential."

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:35.770
I think strategy is essential.

00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:40.000
I think it is important to
think clearly and consciously

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.250
and deliberately about
what you're trying to do.

00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:45.470
But it should always be
done with this awareness

00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:48.580
that you can't control
your future environment.

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:52.020
There are other
players involved.

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:54.410
And things will
happen that's nobody's

00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:58.299
expected that will change
what you want to achieve.

00:37:58.299 --> 00:38:00.590
So with that, I'd be more
than happy to take questions.

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:01.423
But I'll stop there.

00:38:01.423 --> 00:38:02.906
Thank you very much indeed.

00:38:02.906 --> 00:38:08.109
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:08.109 --> 00:38:09.850
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for the talk.

00:38:09.850 --> 00:38:12.590
I was wondering when
you were talking

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:16.225
about the theory of decisive
battle and von Clausewitz--

00:38:16.225 --> 00:38:17.475
I haven't read von Clausewitz.

00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:27.380
I'd be curious to
know how much this

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:30.320
is based on their actual
interpretation of history.

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:33.800
And did that actually happen
in the centuries beforehand?

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:35.770
Or is it more something
you get from, at least

00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:38.810
today what we see in
fiction and literature,

00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:40.830
this idea of champion
versus champion

00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:42.467
and one side just surrendering?

00:38:42.467 --> 00:38:45.050
Like, I don't know how much that
actually happened in history?

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:47.240
And was that actually
a valid strategy

00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:48.850
for some period of time?

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:51.225
SIR LAWRENCE FREEDMAN: Well,
it's an interesting question

00:38:51.225 --> 00:38:56.720
because actually in
the 18th century,

00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:00.120
battle wasn't so decisive.

00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:03.100
It was very much a
response to Napoleon

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:04.280
and what Napoleon achieved.

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:06.670
So it was based on
experience but actually

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:08.060
quite a limited one.

00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:12.570
And Clausewitz famously, as
he was writing his great work

00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:16.640
on war, had a rethink because
you looked back and realized

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:20.650
there were alternative ways
in which conflicts could

00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:25.290
be resolved other than
by the decisive battle,

00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:30.420
although all his
instincts-- and he never

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:32.380
finished writing his
book, so we don't quite

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:34.460
know how it would've
ended up-- pushed him

00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:35.850
towards decisive battle.

00:39:35.850 --> 00:39:38.740
Jomini never really
veered away from that.

00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:41.070
He disliked guerrilla warfare.

00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:44.620
He thought this was sort
of beneath contempt,

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:46.770
though he knew it happened.

00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:48.860
And interestingly,
Jomini was actually

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:52.410
a far greater influence on
American military thought

00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:56.470
than was Clausewitz though
he's less remembered now.

00:39:56.470 --> 00:40:00.280
So it was based on a
very limited experience

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:03.230
but very powerful
experience that these men

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:04.130
have been through.

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:05.880
AUDIENCE: Is there
actually a lot of cases

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:08.610
throughout history
where you do see

00:40:08.610 --> 00:40:11.100
war is being fought where
it ends up being champion

00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:13.360
versus champion or king
versus king or something

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:14.490
and it steps down?

00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:16.200
Because I almost have the
suspicion that that doesn't

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:17.880
actually happen in
practice and instead

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:20.970
you see the 16 Years War
or the Hundred Years War

00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:23.190
or battle after
battle after battle.

00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:25.065
SIR LAWRENCE FREEDMAN:
Well, that's obviously

00:40:25.065 --> 00:40:27.910
part of my point is that if you
don't have a decisive victory,

00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:29.210
then these things go on.

00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:30.543
But, of course, there have been.

00:40:30.543 --> 00:40:34.640
I mean, you can think of
the Six Day War in 1967.

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:37.680
The Israelis got
in the first blow.

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:40.210
They took on an apparently
powerful coalition,

00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:41.190
and they won.

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:43.480
Now, you can then say
they won but they're

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:47.755
still struggling and
fighting in the territories

00:40:47.755 --> 00:40:49.630
they occupied then or
some of the territories

00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:50.870
they occupied there.

00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:53.770
So how decisive in the long
term it was is a question.

00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:56.240
But certainly in the short
term it would seem to be.

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:59.120
The state of Bangladesh
exists because India

00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:03.170
went to war against
Pakistan and defeated them.

00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:06.000
So it does happen.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.240
By and large, if
the war is quick,

00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:15.230
then the result tends to be more
decisive that the opponent has

00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:16.500
been caught off guard.

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:17.650
But the memory lingers.

00:41:17.650 --> 00:41:21.160
So 1817, the Franco
Prussian War,

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:24.640
which leads to the
unification of Germany.

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:28.240
Alsace and Lorraine
taken from the French,

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:31.070
the resentments
were still there.

00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:33.380
1918, there's a
defeat of Germany.

00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:35.740
But the resentment
is still there.

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:37.540
So that's why one
of the points I'm

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:40.120
trying to make in
terms of things

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:42.490
are never quite as
decisive as they seem.

00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:45.570
But they have moved you
to a different stage.

00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:47.960
AUDIENCE: It seems
you're suggesting

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:51.430
that the traditional military
distinction between strategy

00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:55.020
and tactics should
be obliterated,

00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:58.734
much more of a fusion
of those two concepts.

00:41:58.734 --> 00:41:59.900
SIR LAWRENCE FREEDMAN: Yeah.

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:08.050
I mean, there's a very strong
and understandable hierarchy

00:42:08.050 --> 00:42:10.090
in thinking, which
to some extent

00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:12.500
reflects command structures.

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:17.830
You've got the political
masters, the general staff,

00:42:17.830 --> 00:42:21.760
and the senior command,
the field commander,

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:23.490
the local general.

00:42:23.490 --> 00:42:28.120
And tactics is right at
the bottom of all of that.

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:31.180
But the principle, it seems
to be, are often the same.

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:32.982
Obviously, the scale can vary.

00:42:32.982 --> 00:42:34.440
So in recent times
people have been

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:37.390
writing about, say,
the strategic corporal

00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:40.660
because say you're a
young platoon commander

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:44.230
and you're in the middle
of a not very friendly city

00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:48.880
and facing a big demonstration,
the choices that you make

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:50.860
can have big consequences.

00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:54.520
And you don't have a chance to
feed up the chain of command.

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:58.550
You've got seconds sometimes
in which to make a decision.

00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:03.671
So obviously there's questions
of scale and consequences

00:43:03.671 --> 00:43:04.170
that vary.

00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:06.130
But the principles are the same.

00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:11.380
It's a complex
argument to get it now.

00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:15.110
But one of the pushes
in a lot of thinking

00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:18.240
about military
strategy has been what

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:22.410
they call to develop the
operational level somewhere

00:43:22.410 --> 00:43:27.370
between tactics and military
strategy, which is actually

00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:30.280
a politics free zone
as it's described.

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:31.810
And you can see
why a general might

00:43:31.810 --> 00:43:33.125
like of politics free zone.

00:43:33.125 --> 00:43:37.000
But it's not actually healthy,
and actually it's not actually

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:42.180
correct because most military
force, when it's applied,

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:47.050
has political implications
in every way it goes forward.

00:43:47.050 --> 00:43:52.150
So, yeah, there's
actually quite a chunk

00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:53.820
of the book which
is challenging,

00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:56.460
not so much the distinction
between strategy and tactics,

00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:59.720
but the way in which these
very definite hierarchies

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:01.090
of strategy have developed.

00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:02.506
AUDIENCE: Do you
have any thoughts

00:44:02.506 --> 00:44:04.020
around what's going
on in Washington

00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:07.680
right now with the brinkmanship
around the government shut down

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:08.860
and the fiscal cliff?

00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:11.360
I'd be interested to hear your
thoughts about the strategies

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:14.136
that are being used and what
strategies should be used.

00:44:17.217 --> 00:44:19.300
SIR LAWRENCE FREEDMAN: I'm
not sure as a foreigner

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:21.754
I should interfere in
your internal affairs.

00:44:21.754 --> 00:44:22.765
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:22.765 --> 00:44:24.140
SIR LAWRENCE
FREEDMAN: I mean, it

00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:27.890
was weird because I arrived
in Washington on Tuesday.

00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:30.050
And my first meeting
was cancelled.

00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:32.720
And the guy who was supposed to
chair my second was furloughed.

00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:39.180
But we did have furlough fries
for lunch, which was fun.

00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:41.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:45.540
SIR LAWRENCE FREEDMAN: It's
actually a fascinating case

00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:50.662
because it appears
simply as sort

00:44:50.662 --> 00:44:54.810
of Congress versus the
Executive Branch or Republicans

00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:55.920
versus Democrats.

00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:58.550
But actually the
key question is why

00:44:58.550 --> 00:45:01.310
does a group of
Republican congressman

00:45:01.310 --> 00:45:05.660
feel able to withstand the
tremendous amount of pressure

00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:10.760
that in other circumstances
would be assumed to be almost

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:13.640
irresistible
because it threatens

00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:19.480
the ability of your party to
win elections in the future?

00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:23.570
No opinion poll is suggesting
that the actions of the House

00:45:23.570 --> 00:45:27.150
Republicans at the moment are
anything other than unpopular,

00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:35.190
or that many of the
House Republicans

00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:36.160
are unhappy with this.

00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:39.800
But this is sufficient to tie
the hand of Speaker Boehner.

00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:42.285
So one question is why
doesn't he face them down?

00:45:42.285 --> 00:45:43.660
And that presumably
has something

00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:45.080
to do with his own position.

00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:48.300
But why do these
guys feel they don't

00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:49.840
have to worry about
this pressure?

00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:53.580
Because their own positions
are absolutely safe

00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:56.650
because of
redistricting, because

00:45:56.650 --> 00:46:01.940
of the fact that they can get
funds from wealthy supporters,

00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:03.760
and they don't have to
go through the party

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:05.000
to get the funds.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.050
They feel absolutely safe.

00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:11.780
And so they can pursue
this crusade, if you like,

00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:17.020
without personally having
to face the consequences.

00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:22.320
And it will have to be broken
when-- maybe they also think

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:26.020
that because of the pressure
of default or something

00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:28.810
that the president will be the
one who has to blink first.

00:46:28.810 --> 00:46:30.390
Maybe that's also part of it.

00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:33.250
I don't see how he can't.

00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:35.811
So my guess is
that at some point

00:46:35.811 --> 00:46:38.060
there will be sufficient
pressure from the Republicans

00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:42.520
on Speaker Boehner that he
has to find some [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:46.170
It's not immediately
obvious at the moment.

00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:49.200
And I think it's an absolutely
classic strategic problem

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:53.410
because it's not just a
question of the tactics that

00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:54.170
are being adopted.

00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:57.180
It's the way the whole issue
is structured and also the way

00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:58.120
it's framed.

00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:02.070
So the speaker
wants it to appear

00:47:02.070 --> 00:47:04.695
as a problem with a
lack of compromise.

00:47:04.695 --> 00:47:08.660
The president wants it to
appear as a problem of extortion

00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:09.820
and bullying.

00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:12.610
It has very big consequences.

00:47:12.610 --> 00:47:16.000
The trouble with academic
students of strategy,

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.940
we can find all
sorts of grim events

00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:20.817
absolutely riveting
without thinking always

00:47:20.817 --> 00:47:21.650
of the consequences.

00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:25.050
I think it's very
serious because it

00:47:25.050 --> 00:47:26.990
goes to the heart
of the governability

00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:28.920
and the reputation
of the United States.

00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:31.390
But as a strategic
problem it reveals

00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:32.969
quite a lot of important issues.

00:47:32.969 --> 00:47:34.760
AUDIENCE: So your whole
talk really focused

00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:37.280
on the evolution of
strategy and then

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:39.610
defining really
what is the success

00:47:39.610 --> 00:47:41.200
and what's the end goal.

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:42.730
And I feel that
heavily in the path

00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:46.030
is this aspect of probability
and luck to actually get there.

00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:48.396
And over the years luck
has become probability,

00:47:48.396 --> 00:47:50.020
which now we have
predictive analytics.

00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:52.400
And I was wondering with
all the computing power

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:54.051
and predictive
analytics these days,

00:47:54.051 --> 00:47:55.550
how much you felt
strategy was going

00:47:55.550 --> 00:47:56.925
to change in the
next five years,

00:47:56.925 --> 00:47:59.030
and what direction you
thought it would go?

00:47:59.030 --> 00:48:01.670
SIR LAWRENCE FREEDMAN:
That's really interesting.

00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:04.750
Clearly you can
trace this back--

00:48:04.750 --> 00:48:08.070
and I do trace it back-- to
the 1950s, and particularly

00:48:08.070 --> 00:48:14.580
the RAND Corporation,
which were the first to see

00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:19.980
the possibilities of making
calculations using computers,

00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:27.530
which they had, that the
human mind couldn't make

00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:30.460
and, in a sense,
simulating states

00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:32.800
of affairs that
would in other ways

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:34.730
be beyond human imagination.

00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:42.845
So since then there's been
a continuing belief that it

00:48:42.845 --> 00:48:47.870
is actually possible to
crank in the variables,

00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:53.010
to almost experiment,
a little experiment

00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:55.190
in the way and engineer
would, and work out

00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:58.140
how things are likely work out.

00:48:58.140 --> 00:49:03.020
And I think if you're trying
to understand human behavior

00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:07.430
in the mass, a lot of basic
supply and demand stuff,

00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:08.950
this will stand
you in good stead.

00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:12.130
If you're talking about
relatively stable societies

00:49:12.130 --> 00:49:14.770
with growth and stable
behavior patterns,

00:49:14.770 --> 00:49:17.569
this could be quite interesting.

00:49:17.569 --> 00:49:19.110
But I wouldn't want
to be the one who

00:49:19.110 --> 00:49:23.850
relies upon it if it was
a really big decision.

00:49:23.850 --> 00:49:28.420
If it's an outlying
decision, if you're

00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:34.390
talking about situations
where the sample size is small

00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:39.900
and the variables are many and
the possibilities of chance

00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:42.920
and luck are considerable,
then as likely

00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:45.299
as not your predictions
will let you down.

00:49:45.299 --> 00:49:46.840
And you've always
got the possibility

00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:49.440
that somebody else is
doing the same calculations

00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:57.830
on the other side, and coming to
the same conclusions about what

00:49:57.830 --> 00:50:00.770
might happen, and
acting accordingly.

00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:02.980
There has been a degree
of experimentation.

00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:04.780
I mean, like all of
these experiments,

00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:07.030
they're largely done
on graduate students

00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:10.380
in this part of the world.

00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:13.180
So whether this is
representative behavior,

00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:13.740
one can ask.

00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:15.948
But they show actually that
people aren't necessarily

00:50:15.948 --> 00:50:16.830
naturally strategic.

00:50:16.830 --> 00:50:19.159
But they understand when
they're in these situations.

00:50:19.159 --> 00:50:21.200
They understand they need
to vary their behavior.

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:25.460
If they're too predictable
in a sort of repeated game,

00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:26.790
they'll get caught up.

00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:30.440
So I think there
are possibilities

00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:36.470
to understand large areas
of human affairs, which

00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:38.930
often in many ways
are not political.

00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:41.500
They're just the way that
people operate and relate

00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:43.160
to their environment.

00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:46.170
But the more political it
becomes and the more conscious

00:50:46.170 --> 00:50:49.630
people are that
they're in a conflict,

00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:54.300
I think the less likely it
is that that will in the end

00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:56.657
take you as far as
people might hope.

00:50:56.657 --> 00:50:58.990
AUDIENCE: I was wondering if
you could talk a little bit

00:50:58.990 --> 00:51:02.330
about the roll of
process innovations,

00:51:02.330 --> 00:51:07.250
particularly things like
the Roman camp formation

00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:09.935
and John Boyd's
description of the OODA

00:51:09.935 --> 00:51:13.460
loop and the tactical
operation center

00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:18.540
and how they contribute
to changes in strategy.

00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:21.480
Oh, and also impact
as force multipliers.

00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:23.590
SIR LAWRENCE FREEDMAN: Yeah.

00:51:23.590 --> 00:51:25.752
I spent a bit of
time on John Boyd,

00:51:25.752 --> 00:51:27.460
more than the other
things you mentioned,

00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:32.860
because Boyd was an
innovative thinker.

00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:34.823
For those of you
who don't know, he

00:51:34.823 --> 00:51:42.120
was a fighter pilot who wrote
the manuals on dog fights out

00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:47.460
of this idea of the OODA
lopp, which is Observation,

00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:49.605
Orientation,
Decision, Adaptation.

00:51:49.605 --> 00:51:50.480
I think that's right.

00:51:53.290 --> 00:51:55.450
Which was a way of
getting to the idea

00:51:55.450 --> 00:51:59.850
that what was important was
thinking faster and more

00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:02.880
accurately than your opponent
rather than necessarily having

00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:04.175
more firepower.

00:52:04.175 --> 00:52:06.874
And it was a very
influential idea.

00:52:06.874 --> 00:52:07.790
It was not a bad idea.

00:52:07.790 --> 00:52:09.210
I mean, it had a lot of effect.

00:52:09.210 --> 00:52:13.765
And some of other of Boyd's
ideas were less successful.

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:22.390
I don't think there's
any basic problem

00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:24.150
with the idea of the OODA loop.

00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:29.860
It's like one of these
things like SWAT analysis.

00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:36.490
They're useful tools once
you start thinking about it.

00:52:36.490 --> 00:52:39.180
What I thought you were going
to ask about when you started

00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:45.370
talking about process is
things where people have tried

00:52:45.370 --> 00:52:50.420
to change strategies that
have been based on essentially

00:52:50.420 --> 00:52:52.860
change the way you go
about your business,

00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:54.970
which a lot of business
strategies like that.

00:52:54.970 --> 00:52:56.969
And the one I spent a bit
of time on in the book

00:52:56.969 --> 00:53:00.060
is business process
re-engineering,

00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:06.810
which was a fascinating
example of a fad,

00:53:06.810 --> 00:53:08.740
and a very influential one.

00:53:08.740 --> 00:53:10.870
Al Gore once thought
about applying it

00:53:10.870 --> 00:53:12.832
to the United States
government, which may not

00:53:12.832 --> 00:53:15.260
have been a bad idea, I guess.

00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:17.650
And it was based on
the idea that you

00:53:17.650 --> 00:53:24.160
could take a particular
process or a company

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:27.990
or any organization, break it
down into its component parts,

00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:30.820
analyze each individually,
relate them to each other,

00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:34.440
and then them together again
into some more efficient form.

00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:39.860
And it sort of swept the
board in the mid 1990s

00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:42.381
because it was seen to be
a way of taking advantage

00:53:42.381 --> 00:53:45.005
of the digital revolution, which
was part of what's Boyd's OODA

00:53:45.005 --> 00:53:53.370
loop did, and gave you the
possibility of being much more

00:53:53.370 --> 00:53:56.150
efficient, creating more
shareholder value, and so on.

00:53:56.150 --> 00:54:00.450
The problem was it soon became
associated with redundancy

00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:05.230
because in order to demonstrate
where the change had happened,

00:54:05.230 --> 00:54:08.750
as often as not those who'd
been through the process

00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:12.560
said and we've lost these
people who've been let go,

00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:15.580
whatever the euphemism is.

00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:19.050
And the consequence of
that is that as soon

00:54:19.050 --> 00:54:20.990
as firm started talking
about business process

00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:24.700
re-engineering, the workforce
got a little anxious

00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:27.480
and resistance set in.

00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:30.180
And then like so many
of these fads, which

00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:33.060
had been over hyped, once people
started looking at the claimed

00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:36.090
successes, they found other
reasons or the successes

00:54:36.090 --> 00:54:38.120
didn't last and so
on and so forth.

00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:43.830
And often it had some quite
good ideas in it got lost.

00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:46.020
And also one of the
problems with it

00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:49.890
was the narrative around it.

00:54:49.890 --> 00:54:54.910
So when you had the proponents
of this saying management

00:54:54.910 --> 00:55:00.960
has joined the dangerous
professions, help the wounded

00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:03.690
but should the
stragglers, and so on,

00:55:03.690 --> 00:55:06.360
that sort of macho language
with which it was spoken about

00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:08.630
was also part of the resistance.

00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:13.770
So I think a lot of this
is a warning against hype.

00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:16.710
I mean, any organization
needs to look at its process.

00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:20.510
And some strategies need
a change in process.

00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:22.830
Some processes lead to
a change in strategy.

00:55:22.830 --> 00:55:24.930
But it's all these
things, this belief

00:55:24.930 --> 00:55:27.050
that you've got the
winning formula that

00:55:27.050 --> 00:55:28.870
will be the key to
everything that's

00:55:28.870 --> 00:55:30.887
often the cause of trouble.

00:55:30.887 --> 00:55:31.970
BORIS: Thank you everyone.

00:55:31.970 --> 00:55:36.580
Please join me in thanking
Sir Lawrence Freedman.

00:55:36.580 --> 00:55:41.466
