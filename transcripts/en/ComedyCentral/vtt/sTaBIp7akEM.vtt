00:00:01.468 --> 00:00:03.603
- Hi, we're, uh,
the Walsh brothers.

00:00:03.603 --> 00:00:04.537
We used to live here.

00:00:04.537 --> 00:00:05.405
We grew up here.

00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:06.606 align:start size:72% position:28%
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

00:00:06.606 --> 00:00:08.041 align:start size:88% position:13%
- We just moved in.
- Can we come in and...

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:09.342 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Take a look around?
- Is it okay?

00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:11.111 line:0%
- Well, I don't know.

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:23.857
(trumpets playing)

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:29.062
- Shh.

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:29.896
Shh.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.000
- Oh, they changed everything.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.235
- That's Grace.

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:40.240 align:start size:97% position:3%
- You know, when we lived
here it was a lot more white.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.542
You got the blood
out of the carpet.

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:44.310
- Hey, what grade are you in?

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.879
- Uh, eighth.

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.248 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Oh, eighth, so you probably
do a little of this, huh?

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:50.050
- Hey, you got any Satriani?

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.352 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Oh, remember this is
where we used to measure our

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:53.887 align:start size:94% position:6%
heights when we were kids.
- Oh yeah.

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:55.955
And this is where we used to
measure our penis lengths.

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:56.790
- Right there.
- Right here.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.725
- Our dad was a doctor.

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:05.165
(menacing music)

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.003 align:start size:94% position:6%
- [David] How's, uh,
everything going tonight?

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:10.837
- Great.
- Great?

00:01:10.837 --> 00:01:12.072
- Yeah.

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:13.740
- Because you know
what time it is?

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.874
- No.

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:16.276
- Personal disco.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.044
(disco music)

00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:19.379
- And then uh...

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:32.926
- We had a, uh, bunk bed in here

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:36.062
and you know, bunk bed,
one on top of each other,

00:01:36.062 --> 00:01:37.197 align:start size:84% position:16%
but we always slept
on the bottom.

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:38.665
- [Chris] Right.

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:41.201 align:start size:94% position:6%
- The top was for any
ladies that we would get.

00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:43.269
We'd make them sit on the top
- We never got any ladies.

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:44.737
And we would poke them like
this, poke, poke, poke, poke.

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:47.607
- It was a fun game but
we never got any ladies,

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:49.275
just our sister.

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:50.677
You like Joe Satriani?

00:01:50.677 --> 00:01:53.279
(gentle music)

00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:57.817
(menacing music)

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:01.788
(bright music)

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.539
(police sirens)

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:21.541
(menacing music)

00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:23.276
- My god, we used
to sit out here...

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:24.511
- Yes?

00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:25.879
- And just look
at all the crime.

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:26.846
- I'll do it man.

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:28.114 align:start size:72% position:28%
(kid laughing)
I'll do it.

00:02:28.114 --> 00:02:29.349 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Young Boy] No, don't do it.
- I'll do it.

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:30.316 align:start size:84% position:16%
- When I lived here,
this is where all

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:32.919
the magic happened too.

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:34.120
- In the rumble room?

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.922 align:start size:84% position:16%
- No, no, this is
where my sister slept.

00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:37.257
(woman laughing)

00:02:37.257 --> 00:02:39.826
- Yeah, but she was
an amateur magician.

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:41.027
- Oh.

00:02:41.027 --> 00:02:42.495 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah, she made magic
happen everywhere.

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:44.898
- My sister made me drink her
pee once when I was eight.

00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:46.933
- Oh, thank you, you know
those are really just,

00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:49.202 align:start size:97% position:3%
these are just kind of
decorative so if you just want

00:02:49.202 --> 00:02:52.038 align:start size:97% position:3%
to put those back there,
- [David] Is this one yours?

00:02:52.038 --> 00:02:53.907 align:start size:88% position:13%
that would be great
- [David] Is this yours?

00:02:53.907 --> 00:02:54.874
- You know--

00:02:54.874 --> 00:02:56.709
- That's broken. That's broken.

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.378 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Okay, um, I was
just going to tell you

00:02:58.378 --> 00:03:00.046
a story about Sylvia Plath.

00:03:00.046 --> 00:03:02.115
- You got any, uh, Joe Satriani?

00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:04.284
- No, no, we lived
here in the 90's.

00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:05.852
We were born here in the 70's.

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:07.053
- No, you didn't.

00:03:07.053 --> 00:03:08.054 align:start size:81% position:19%
This house was
built in the 80's.

00:03:08.054 --> 00:03:10.490
- What is that right there?

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.259
(dramatic music)

00:03:14.994 --> 00:03:18.498
(menacing music)

00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:20.300
- Okay, I don't, can you...

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.634
- Here comes the submarine.

00:03:21.634 --> 00:03:23.369
- [Woman] Oh my gosh.

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:25.972
(upbeat music)

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.510
