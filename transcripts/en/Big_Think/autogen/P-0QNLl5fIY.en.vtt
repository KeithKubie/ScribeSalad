anymore and so in the chapter I do write
about some techniques we can use because

we can build it up into larger
 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.410
we can build it up into larger
accomplishments later some of the small

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420
accomplishments later some of the small
 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.639
accomplishments later some of the small
things are they there's a study that

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649
things are they there's a study that
 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.340
things are they there's a study that
shows that just managing your posture

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350

just stopping swearing for two weeks
those people are able to manage more

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880
those people are able to manage more
 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.520
those people are able to manage more
stressful tasks later they able to do

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530
stressful tasks later they able to do
 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.690
stressful tasks later they able to do
more tasks that involve physical

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700
more tasks that involve physical
 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.510
more tasks that involve physical
discomfort after that two-week period so

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520
discomfort after that two-week period so
 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.220
discomfort after that two-week period so
in a way they've kind of third exercise

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230
in a way they've kind of third exercise
 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.199
in a way they've kind of third exercise
self-control in one dimension but it's

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209
self-control in one dimension but it's
 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.330
self-control in one dimension but it's
leading into this other realm as well

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340
leading into this other realm as well
 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.039
leading into this other realm as well
and then there's there's another study

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049
and then there's there's another study
 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.979
and then there's there's another study
where they shook that they pay people to

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989
where they shook that they pay people to
 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.809
where they shook that they pay people to
usage in eight times in one month and

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819
usage in eight times in one month and
 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.910
usage in eight times in one month and
they pay another group to use it once a

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920
they pay another group to use it once a
 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.770
they pay another group to use it once a
month and then they don't pay anyone at

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780
month and then they don't pay anyone at
 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.420
month and then they don't pay anyone at
all the next month and the people who've

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430
all the next month and the people who've
 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.220
all the next month and the people who've
been using the Jim Frey times they were

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230
been using the Jim Frey times they were
 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.780
been using the Jim Frey times they were
paid to go any times they start defusing

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790
paid to go any times they start defusing
 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.309

the gym without getting paid
 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.440
the gym without getting paid
and so they've built up this habit and

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450
and so they've built up this habit and
 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.539
and so they've built up this habit and
so you can start small start with small

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549
so you can start small start with small
 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.550
so you can start small start with small
things make them a habit and then build

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560
things make them a habit and then build
 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.539
things make them a habit and then build
up to bigger things

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549
up to bigger things
 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.940
up to bigger things
there's also something called temptation

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950
there's also something called temptation
 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.610
there's also something called temptation
bundling and so we compare a want

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620
bundling and so we compare a want
 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.979
bundling and so we compare a want
activity with a should activity no one

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989
activity with a should activity no one
 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.660
activity with a should activity no one
really wants to do it should activity

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670
really wants to do it should activity
 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.150
really wants to do it should activity
all the time but in another study they

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160
all the time but in another study they
 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.860
all the time but in another study they
had people who listened to a really

the novel is tied to the gym they go to
the gym much more frequently than the

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220
the gym much more frequently than the
 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.650
the gym much more frequently than the
people who get to listen to this novel

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660
people who get to listen to this novel
 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.690
people who get to listen to this novel
all the time and in fact after the

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700
all the time and in fact after the
 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.460
all the time and in fact after the
experiment is over that group of people

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470
experiment is over that group of people
 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.440
experiment is over that group of people
actually wants to pay to stay on the

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450
actually wants to pay to stay on the
 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.819
actually wants to pay to stay on the
experiment because it's so successful

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829
experiment because it's so successful
 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.159
experiment because it's so successful
successful that it forces them to go to

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:19.169
successful that it forces them to go to
 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:21.349
successful that it forces them to go to
the gym all the time and so we can pair

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359
the gym all the time and so we can pair
 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:22.940
the gym all the time and so we can pair
like a should activity with the want

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950
like a should activity with the want
 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.440
like a should activity with the want
activity to get us to do those things

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450
activity to get us to do those things
 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.940
activity to get us to do those things
and hopefully those things then become

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950
and hopefully those things then become
 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.940
and hopefully those things then become
habit over time but it is a muscle and

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950
habit over time but it is a muscle and
 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.650
habit over time but it is a muscle and
even willpower you have to give it a

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660
even willpower you have to give it a
 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.500
even willpower you have to give it a
little bit of a break and so when people

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510
little bit of a break and so when people
 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.599
little bit of a break and so when people
do a should activity all the time they

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609
do a should activity all the time they
 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:37.520
do a should activity all the time they
get fatigued and they show health care

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530
get fatigued and they show health care
 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:38.839
get fatigued and they show health care
workers they're supposed to wash their

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849
workers they're supposed to wash their
 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:41.360
workers they're supposed to wash their
hands all day and they start doing it

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370
hands all day and they start doing it
 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.270
hands all day and they start doing it
less at the end of the day and so when

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280
less at the end of the day and so when
 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.680
less at the end of the day and so when
they give them longer breaks in between

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690
they give them longer breaks in between
 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.390
they give them longer breaks in between
their shifts they find that they'll

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400
their shifts they find that they'll
 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.949
their shifts they find that they'll
continue to do it they'll wash their

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959
continue to do it they'll wash their
 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.140
continue to do it they'll wash their
hands too to the end of the day and so

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150
hands too to the end of the day and so
 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.240
hands too to the end of the day and so
it's important to take the breaks

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250
it's important to take the breaks
 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.069
it's important to take the breaks

experiments that really illustrates that

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829
experiments that really illustrates that
 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:03:59.990
experiments that really illustrates that
is that there's one where they have

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000
is that there's one where they have
 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.449

people hold hand sizes in Quitman they
 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:03.920
people hold hand sizes in Quitman they
have them do this a hand exercise and

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930
have them do this a hand exercise and
 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.170
have them do this a hand exercise and
after a while they separate the group

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180
after a while they separate the group
 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.119
after a while they separate the group
into two and let one group watch a

fat which we can get into that too there

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860
fat which we can get into that too there
 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.830
fat which we can get into that too there
are things out there but for now you

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840
are things out there but for now you
 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.330
are things out there but for now you
know we're stuck with what we have the

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340
know we're stuck with what we have the
 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.890
know we're stuck with what we have the
technologies we have and the abilities

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900
technologies we have and the abilities
 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.230
technologies we have and the abilities
that we have and so diet and exercise is

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240
that we have and so diet and exercise is
 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.820

your hormones your other things that are

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770
your hormones your other things that are
 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.740
your hormones your other things that are
making you fat and then you have to be

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750
making you fat and then you have to be
 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.240
making you fat and then you have to be
able to stay on whatever that regimen is

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250
able to stay on whatever that regimen is
 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.650
able to stay on whatever that regimen is
that you pick and that's why willpower

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660
that you pick and that's why willpower
 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.690
that you pick and that's why willpower
comes in but the book is full of many
