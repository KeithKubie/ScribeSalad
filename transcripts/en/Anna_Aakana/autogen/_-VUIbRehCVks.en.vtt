00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.520
So we all know what being in an unhealthy relationship looks like, right?

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.780
Like, what are some traits that instantly come to mind?

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.720
Being overly critical of each other,

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.540
You used to be funny. Now all your videos are like this advice and motivational bullshit.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.520
Being jealous,

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.320
Where are you and your grandma going?

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.540
Trying to control your partner's actions,

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.040
You're a Catholic now!

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.580
The longest time, I've wondered, like,

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.120
What actually defines a healthy relationship?

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.740
How do you quantify that?

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.840
Well, my therapist said that every relationship can be categorized into three different kinds.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.420
There's living together but separate,

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.080
codependency,

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.700
and then the sweet spot where you have your own identity

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.500
but you share certain aspects of your life with your partner.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.800
In a healthy relationship,

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.800
you spend time away from each other.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:44.900
I miss you.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.500
-I miss you too.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.840
No, I miss you more!

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.100
-No, I do!

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.700
Send me a dick pic.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.920
You continue living your life independently

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.280
and grow as a person.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.800
I'm gonna eat this entire fucking pizza.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.220
And your partner supports that.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.860
-I'm so proud of you, baby.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.360
I just wish you would've saved a piece for me.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.200
You're also insanely happy for each other's success.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.200
That dick pic is phenomenal!

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.980
The lighting, the filter...

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.640
Your camera skills have gotten so good.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.820
So, if you're in an unhappy or codependent relationship,

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.820
I encourage you

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.140
to go to couple's therapy

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.580
or... try to seek out someone who will give you that healthy relationship that you deserve.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.940
Anyway, as you may have noticed

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.800
there have been extravagant landmarks in the background of this video

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.760
and that's because Contiki was so kind to send me to Italy

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.100
I've been to Rome, Florence, and Venice and it has been such an amazing experience.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.720
So, thank you so much for sending me.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.580
You can go ahead! Thank you.
-Thank you

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.580
I've had so much food,

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.820
I've made so many friends

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.220
and it's been a while since I've traveled the world

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.160
so it's great to see this kind of amazing, beautiful shit!

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.780
Anyway, I'm Anna Akana

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.040
You, stay awesome.
