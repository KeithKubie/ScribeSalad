sometimes I get asked the question who's

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610
sometimes I get asked the question who's
 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.200
sometimes I get asked the question who's
my role model you know and I guess the

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210
my role model you know and I guess the
 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.570
my role model you know and I guess the
answer to that is it probably depends it

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580
answer to that is it probably depends it
 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.600
answer to that is it probably depends it
at what age when I was really young and

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610
at what age when I was really young and
 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.160
at what age when I was really young and
probably did have role models that

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170
probably did have role models that
 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.410
probably did have role models that
really affected me I didn't know the

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420
really affected me I didn't know the
 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.750
really affected me I didn't know the
concept of a role model so I actually

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760
concept of a role model so I actually
 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.960
concept of a role model so I actually
think that the role models that if that

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970
think that the role models that if that
 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.870
think that the role models that if that
we have that really helped determine our

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880
we have that really helped determine our
 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.450
we have that really helped determine our
character I mean of course there are our

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460
character I mean of course there are our
 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.589
character I mean of course there are our
parents and our friends but made a

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599
parents and our friends but made a
 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.120
parents and our friends but made a
family but I don't think we really think

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130
family but I don't think we really think
 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.590
family but I don't think we really think
about that at a time when it has the

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600
about that at a time when it has the
 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.360
about that at a time when it has the
most effect later on in life you know as

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370
most effect later on in life you know as
 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.100
most effect later on in life you know as
you're an adult and you're you have your

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110
you're an adult and you're you have your
 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.330
you're an adult and you're you have your
teachers and I've had mine but I i guess

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340
teachers and I've had mine but I i guess
 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.180
teachers and I've had mine but I i guess
i don't i feel like i've had many not

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190
i don't i feel like i've had many not
 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.010
i don't i feel like i've had many not
just one and I've been very fortunate

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020
just one and I've been very fortunate
 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.619
just one and I've been very fortunate
for that reason and I think people who

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629
for that reason and I think people who
 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.299
for that reason and I think people who
are successful in life are our have the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309
are successful in life are our have the
 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.049
are successful in life are our have the
wonderful accident of having having had

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059
wonderful accident of having having had
 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.180
wonderful accident of having having had
whether intentional or not sometimes you

whether intentional or not sometimes you
 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.539
whether intentional or not sometimes you
find the person who you admire that's a

find the person who you admire that's a
 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.450
find the person who you admire that's a
skill but this the ability to have that

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460
skill but this the ability to have that
 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.219
skill but this the ability to have that
skill to seek out a role model is

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229
skill to seek out a role model is
 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.070
skill to seek out a role model is
something that probably is acquired

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080
something that probably is acquired
 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.399
something that probably is acquired
through role models that we don't seek

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409
through role models that we don't seek
 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.830

out as a young scientist there there was

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840
out as a young scientist there there was
 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.429
out as a young scientist there there was
a great biochemist who was very very

a great biochemist who was very very
 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.520
a great biochemist who was very very
influential to me and also i have to say

when you interview randy schekman I'm
 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.899
when you interview randy schekman I'm
sure you hear the same name his name was

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909
sure you hear the same name his name was

learning biochemistry and I actually
 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.020

left medical school without finishing my
 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.929
left medical school without finishing my

really and actually was a great

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989
really and actually was a great

really and actually was a great
inspiration to me the work that was

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510
inspiration to me the work that was
 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.270
inspiration to me the work that was
recognized in this Nobel Prize my

contribution to it began during that

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:23.409
contribution to it began during that
 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:27.000
contribution to it began during that
period and I don't think that I would

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010
period and I don't think that I would
 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.039
period and I don't think that I would
have been as successful in doing what I

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049
have been as successful in doing what I
 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.229
have been as successful in doing what I
did if it were not for the kind of

did if it were not for the kind of
scientific environment that he fostered

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799
scientific environment that he fostered
 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.470
scientific environment that he fostered
and the type of science that he

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480
and the type of science that he
 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.410
and the type of science that he
represented which we called enzymology

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420
represented which we called enzymology
 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.110

and he was without a doubt the master of

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120
and he was without a doubt the master of
 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.229
and he was without a doubt the master of
in zoology of his era and for me to have

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239
in zoology of his era and for me to have
 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.839
in zoology of his era and for me to have
the opportunity to take that discipline

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849
the opportunity to take that discipline
 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.360
the opportunity to take that discipline
to a new level you know under the

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370
to a new level you know under the
 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.520
to a new level you know under the
watchful eyes of the master was quite an

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530
watchful eyes of the master was quite an
 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.650
watchful eyes of the master was quite an
extraordinary experience he won the

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660
extraordinary experience he won the
 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.240
extraordinary experience he won the
Nobel Prize by the way many years ago

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250
Nobel Prize by the way many years ago
 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.959
