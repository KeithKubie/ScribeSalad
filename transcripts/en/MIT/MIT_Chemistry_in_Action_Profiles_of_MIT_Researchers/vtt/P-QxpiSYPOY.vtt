JACQUIN NILES:
All of my memories

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.870
are growing up in a really tiny,
British-dependent territory

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.580
called Anguilla.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.110
To give you some
perspective, it's

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.320
about 35 square miles total
area, 36 during low tide.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.520
People knew each other.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.910
If you didn't know
them directly,

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.840
you knew who their family
and relatives were.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:29.800
I became interested in medicine,
not just from the perspective

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.030
of understanding the
fundamentals of how biology

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.800
works in a living
entity, but also

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.510
the idea that it can go awry.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.610
And how do you fix it?

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:49.250
Every year, about
700,000 or so, mostly

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.250
kids under the age of five, are
estimated to die from malaria.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.610
Malaria is a parasitic disease.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.110
It's caused by this family
of protozoan parasites.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.650
A mosquito becomes
infected by feeding

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.900
on the blood of an
infected person.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.180
That blood can contain
infectious forms

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.990
of a parasite that develops
within the mosquito,

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.020
and eventually will get
into the salivary glands

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.660
of the mosquito, and
then be transmitted back

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.780
to the blood of another
person who was bitten

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.660
by that infected mosquito.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.790
Within the red cell, there's
an extremely high concentration

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.160
of hemoglobin, which contains
the co-factor heme that

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.860
is responsible, largely,
for the transport of oxygen

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.430
in the human body.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.590
The parasite is able to degrade
the majority of the hemoglobin

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.420
within the red cell.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.570
The heme, it has to deal with.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.410
Because heme that
is not polymerized

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.120
has the ability to convert
molecular oxygen into more

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.520
reactive oxygen
species that can be

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.990
damaging to membranes,
proteins, DNA, et cetera.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.780
And so the parasite
has devised a strategy

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.930
for polymerizing this
heme into this inert

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.910
polymer called hemozoin.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.150
And that actually provides
an opportunity for us,

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.850
because if we can prevent
the polymerization of heme,

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.660
in principle, we can see the
toxicity of heme reemerging.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.530
And so some of the
most successful

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.230
anti-malarial compounds,
such as chloroquine,

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.940
can actually bind heme and
prevent its polymerization.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.420
And presumably, the
increased amount

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.360
of free heme that is produced
then kills the parasite.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.090
Why I don't practice
medicine currently,

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.940
I think that's just been a
really valuable perspective

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.810
and a framework for
me to think about what

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.340
I do in the long term,
and how that can translate

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.110
into some impact on human life.
