00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.330
 Today is google developer program engineer Araki 1 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:18.280
 is 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:23.680
 Today I will talk on the theme of ux anti pattern 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:24.730
 x Anti-pattern is a disappointing ui ux that is often found in low-rated apps 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.720
 It is 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:33.610
 This time I will mainly talk about apps other than games 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:37.570
 For each anti-pattern, url of the corresponding page of the official document 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:42.490
 Please see together by all means because it has been described 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:48.370
 Let's first look at anti-patterns related to dialog 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:51.880
 Frequent display of dialogs representing read-in seems to be hated by the user 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:56.170
 It is frustrating if reading is late and can not be canceled 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:01:00.160
 Even if reading is fast, the entire screen flickers, so I'm worried 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.480
 Place a progress bar below the action bar instead 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:08.550
 In the part where content is displayed from now 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:11.730
 It would be better to display the animation being read directly, etc. 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:17.880
 Application book where button position is different from os standard 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:19.560
 You see often When the positive option is on the right in android 4.0 or later 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.930
 It is determined 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:28.570
 The Blanc example dialog is what appears after the user presses the delete button. 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.840
 The only choice is to make a positive justification 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.980
 is 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:39.570
 Next, let's look at the operability on the touch screen 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:46.740
 I still see apps that buttons are too small to push 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:51.329
 The touchable area should basically be 48 bp or more for both vertical and horizontal 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:56.520
 It is a useless pattern that there is no feedback in the touch area 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:02:01.829
 Visual feedback is important as there is no touch on the touch screen 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.939
 Change the color if you touch the button so that you can see which part will respond 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.730
 Let's go 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:11.950
 In addition, when you press the button, the bar will appear on the flower screen. 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:16.960
 It takes some time for the screen to switch, no matter how much speed is up 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:20.460
 It will get frustrating if you don't know if it's done for a short while 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:25.490
 Let's put in touch feedback properly 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:30.980
 ui design is not just to write 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:33.200
 The attraction of the content that should have been the leading role in ui that was overworked and tedious 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:38.930
 Will be difficult to communicate 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:42.650
 Also the design looks inconsistent with the design and the app looks like a flatfish android standard 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:47.959
 Let's customize based on the design 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:53.659
 Furthermore, even if the design is focused on pixel units, it will collapse if the screen size changes 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:03:01.329
 It's messed up with the multi-screen support provided by the android framework 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:03:01.329
 Learn the mechanism and let's design it for use in various screen sizes from the beginning 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:07.680
 In the world of app design that continues to evolve every day, there is no win in the app that rewards rent 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.459
 Hmm 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:17.549
 menu button of shame is android 2.3 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:21.239
 This is a button to simulate the previous menu key with a new start 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:27.670
 As it is only for compatibility with old apps 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:28.060
 It is quite disappointing that this button still appears in the app released in the past year 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:34.180
 Hmm 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:39.190
 The correspondence is just to have the target sdk version of the manifest updated. 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.630
 Flick the target sdk version to support Frey terminal 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:45.060
 Is a mistake 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.060
 Basically always keep it up-to-date 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:55.349
 Do not use the gingerbread era style anymore 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:04:02.610
 In the example shown, it is a button progress bar seek bar but all targets sdk 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:06.930
 You can use the new style just by updating the version and digging the theme 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:09.260
 Using the design for other platforms to make the android app 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.260
 let's stop 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:16.920
 It looks very common in Japanese apps, but the design to place the tab bar below is 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:21.410
 not android 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:25.850
 Tabs are to be placed on top in android 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.930
 In some cases, it is possible to switch by side swipe and navigation drawing wow 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.969
 Use 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:35.529
 Let's create an app that looks like android 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:36.309
 Right-handed cullet with list cone is android style 

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:42.390
 not 

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:47.920
 No caret like the standard setting screen is the android style 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:53.380
 I sometimes see apps that use a different navigation method than the standard 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:56.410
 For example, sometimes there is an app displaying a bar like the one shown at the top of the screen 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:05:03.400
 This is not an android standard design 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:07.510
 The default is to use the action bar as shown below and the setting is basically 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.910
 Put in the action bar overflow menu 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:13.400
 Cash on delivery 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:15.700
 Jason is standard at the same time and originality is demonstrated in the functions and content of the app 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.700
 Let's go 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:28.090
 Don't implement your own shared functionality with no particular meaning 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:34.320
 Sns without using the system standard intent sharing function as shown in the screen 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:40.950
 There is an application that allows users to log in and arrange their own post button 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:46.060
 Unless it is an application that takes a close relationship with a specific sns. 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:50.009
 System standard sharing features should be easier for users 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:55.220
 Easy to implement for developers 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:06:00.320
 It is not recommended to make app ui in leg view 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:06.340
 Just wrap the web app in web view just to bring it up to the play store 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:09.850
 Apps that are in the form of apk at will receive low ratings from users 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:15.130
 As long as you use it appropriately to display the content 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:21.009
 Web view is convenient, but all buttons and menus are created in web view 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:24.340
 There are limits in terms of ease of use and performance as well. 

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:28.660
 It is hated by the user after all 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:33.040
 Unless it takes time to load even through 3d games etc. 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:37.330
 The splash screen is only annoying for the user 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:38.390
 Branding is done on the action bar and content, not on the splash screen 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:44.510
 Let's go 

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:50.660
 Also, when you try to close the application with the back key, there is something to confirm permanently 

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:51.800
 It's not an irreversible distance to quit the app, so you need to ask the user 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.670
 It will not be 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:58.409
 Please refer to the url you see for details. 

00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:01.289
 One when there are multiple notifications of the same type 

00:06:58.409 --> 00:07:07.420
 Let's put together 

00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:10.510
 I also often see apps that only assume usage of vertical phone 

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:15.930
 Many people use the phone sideways 

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:21.060
 Also in the last 12 years, the proportion of tablet devices has become non-negligible 

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:26.910
 Android framework for various terminals using fragments etc 

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:29.330
 Because there is a mechanism to create ui efficiently beforehand, it will be surprising to try it actually 

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:34.300
 it's simple 

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:38.620
 Let's look at the minute problems that you often see 

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:41.030
 The notification icon displayed in the status bar by android standard 

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:45.650
 It is a thing 

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:50.980
 Recently the number of terminals of xxhdpi has increased 

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:55.570
 Are the images for high resolution and high resolution properly aligned? 

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:58.620
 Also, the icons do not have to be in the same shape 

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:58.620
 Let's put out your personality 

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:06.440
 We talked a lot, but let's make it an action bar 

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:11.240
 Navigation is basically an application using the android framework 

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:17.690
 As long as you are making most things that will form naturally and properly 

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:19.169
 Design the app without understanding it properly and receive the ball that the shop does not originally need store day 

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:23.490
 Also from the top user rating 

00:08:19.169 --> 00:08:29.699
 It will be difficult if it will be one song android standard design guide 

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:33.020
 It is a shortcut to a highly rated app to refine the design based on the guidelines 

00:08:29.699 --> 00:08:33.020
 Thank you for watching
