00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.720
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.810
&gt;&gt; Mary Beth Riedner: I'd like
to thank the Library of Congress

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.630
and David M. Rubenstein for
selecting Tales and Travels

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.940
as one of the 2017 Best
Practices Honorees.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.100
I'm here on behalf of the
Gail Borden Public Library

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.400
in Elgin, Illinois.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.870
And also present in the audience
is Karen Mackey[Phonetic],

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.510
who is the former Deputy
Director at Gail Borden,

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.300
who's belief in this idea
helped turn it into a reality.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.260
This morning, we are
hearing about a lot

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.390
of wonderful literacy programs
for children, and for adults

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.020
who never learned to read.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.030
Our focus is on the end
of the age spectrum.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.400
For those stricken with
Alzheimer's disease

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.920
or related dementia in the
last years of their lives.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.790
And there are over 5 million

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.420
such people in our
country today.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.270
Our society still attaches
a stigma to dementia,

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.640
we tend to focus on
the losses instead

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.520
of what people can still do.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.840
So, reading is a skill that's
been assumed to be lost,

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.770
but that is a misconception.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.900
Research bears this out.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.240
Professor Michelle S
Bourgeois from the University

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.920
of South Florida states, "All
of my research demonstrates

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.260
that people who were literate
maintain their ability to read

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.070
until the end stages
of dementia."

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.320
In 2007, the International
Federation

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.290
of Library Associations
published their guidelines

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.520
for library services to
persons with dementia.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.130
And they advocate
for the use of books

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.840
and reading with
this population.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.870
I developed the Tales &amp;
Travels program in 2008

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.840
after my own husband
was diagnosed

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.010
with a young onset dementia.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.780
I learned that each person

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.010
with dementia is still
a unique individual

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.720
with their own interests
and abilities.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.390
Every time we bring
Tales &amp; Travels

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.170
to a new facility we tend
to get the same response

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.800
from staff like, I didn't
know that Martha could read."

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.550
Or, "I'm amazed that that they
stayed for the full hour."

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.040
Assuming that they can no
longer read, no one puts books

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.920
into their hands, or
invites them to read.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.630
So, that's where Tales &amp;
Travel can make a difference.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:22.930
So, how does it work?

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.080
Each month we take participants
on a one-hour imaginary trip

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.400
to another country or region

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.950
in the United States
using library materials.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.570
We invite them to take
turns reading out loud

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.390
from a folk tale, myth or
legend from the chosen location.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.690
We often take them

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.900
from children's --
oh, I went too far.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.150
Go back. There we go.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.100
We often take them from a
children's folk tale collection.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.780
So, we retype them in large font
to make them easier to read,

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.410
and also to maintain
their dignity

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.110
as others have mentioned.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.240
Those who don't choose to
read usually follow along

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.320
with the printed text
or they listen quietly.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.890
We also give then five
interesting facts, inviting them

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.470
to read these out loud as well.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.180
And we often hear comments
from the participants such as,

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.120
"I didn't know that", or
"Isn't' that amazing?"

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.900
We then distribute
carefully selected adults

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.860
and children's books for
them to browse through.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.640
From the adult collection,
we take travel books

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.080
and coffee table books
that are richly illustrated

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.240
with color photographs.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.740
But, we also bring in
related books on the history

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.570
of the areas, the art and
architecture, or cooking.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.320
Children's books are readily
accepted, when they are chosen

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.530
to respect the dignity
of this adult audience.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.290
Simple vocabulary and lots

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.530
of white space make these books
attractive, especially to those

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.420
in the later stages
of the disease.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.760
We do have some samples of
the books in the back row

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.850
for you to take a look at.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.440
As they browse, the
library staff

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.750
and volunteers circulate among
the participants engaging them

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.250
in conversation.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.170
They often want to talk about
memories from their own lives

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.250
that are stimulated by
the book's contents.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.820
This type of socialization is
an extremely important part

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.120
of the program.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.840
Tales &amp; Travel received a Target
Grant from the National Network

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.140
of Libraries and Medicine

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.520
to study the effectiveness
of the program.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.170
The study shows really high
ratings for the overall success

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.320
as you can see in this chart.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.030
Other results include
increased cognitive

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.740
and social interaction,
improved relationships

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.420
between individuals with
dementia and their caregivers,

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.720
and a lessening of
stigma about people

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.020
with dementia among
the volunteers.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.610
So, encouraging literacy
opportunities

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.740
with this too often
forgotten group of people can,

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.350
and does improve the
quality of their lives.

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.250
The Gail Borden Library
received a free tool --

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.550
oh, I'm sorry, provides
a free toolkit

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.470
on its Tales &amp; Travel website

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.420
to help others replicate
the program.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.320
Feel free to contact
me or Glenna Godinksky,

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.360
her contact information
is there,

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.870
with more questions or comments.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.840
It's our hope that this
recognition will inspire

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.880
librarians and others, including
you, to find additional ways

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.800
to make sure that
the gift of books

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.940
and reading remains an
intrical part of the lives

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.010
of those living with dementia.

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.320
Thank you for this attention,
and for this wonderful honor.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.970

of the Library of Congress.
