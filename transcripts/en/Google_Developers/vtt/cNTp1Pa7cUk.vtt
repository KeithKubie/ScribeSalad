00:00:02.928 --> 00:00:04.070
Hey, everybody.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.740
This is Will, and I'm showing
you new features that we are

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.060
releasing in Hangouts
API version 1.1.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.950
Now in this demo, I'm a giant
floating robot head.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.079
And we're using the voice volume
to control my mouth.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.740
However, the head itself is
being controlled by my head.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:25.630
So I can tilt, tilt, zoom way
in, zoom back out again.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:26.880
It's very cool.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.580
So we've added a new message
data channel, which lets you

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.070
send low-latency messages from
your machine to everyone else

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:34.870
in the Hangout.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.860
In this example, I can
draw with my mouse.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.800
Which is fine, but it gets a lot
more exciting when we add

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.190
two different participants.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.290
So in this example, I have two
Hangouts that are running

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.860
side-by-side on different
computers.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.480
So if I draw in one, it appears
on the other one

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.060
nearly instantaneously.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.990
This data channel is very
low-latency, but it is lossy.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.690
So you are going to want to use
Shared State, that we've

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.380
already released, to keep
your Hangout in-sync.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.250
Lastly, we have overlays, like
this one, which are not

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.870
attached to your face.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.410
You can use them anyway
you want.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.440
This one's reversed, because
it's mirrored, because I'm

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.600
watching it on my own machine.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.850
Thanks for watching.
