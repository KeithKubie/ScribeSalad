&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:
From the Library

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:04.630
of Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.970
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: Good
afternoon everyone,

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.470
I am Fenella France, Chief
of the Preservation Research

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.170
and Testing Division, and
on behalf of our division

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.640
and [inaudible] Chief
of the Music Division,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.790
I would like to welcome
you all today

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.500
for our Science Meets
Music: Technical Studies

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.820
of Musical Instruments
Symposium.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.490
We have got a really
exciting lineup

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:40.040
and so I will introduce
[inaudible] and then let us flow

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.720
into the talks without
further ado.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.020
The technical studies

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.930
of historical musical
instruments is not done

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.700
extensively in the field
and so it is fascinating

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.420
and just delightful to have the
speakers we have today brought

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.830
together to actually share
that information on some

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.540
of the research they are doing.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.430
As part of an NEH, National
Endowment for the Humanities,

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.250
Preservation and Access Grant,
the work that has been happening

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.670
at the Library of Congress
along with our colleagues

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:05.970
at George Washington

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.030
and Catholic University is
highlighting the research of

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.970
and the study of glass
flutes by Claude Laurent

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.670
from the library collection--
Dayton C. Miller collection.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.290
And these are some
really exciting research

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.830
that you are going to
hear about shortly.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.290
Collaborations are such an
important part of our work

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.020
and we are delighted that within
this research [inaudible] we can

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.910
not only with colleagues in the
Music Division but also both

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.460
with George Washington
University

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.430
and the Catholic
University of America,

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.410
Vitreous State Laboratory.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.500
The NEH grant has allowed us
to hire a two-year postdoc

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.000
and further collaborations

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.430
with other local institutions
have proved extremely rewarding

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.170
as part of that.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.470
The Preservation Research

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.260
and Testing Division has
been working extensively

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.460
to expand [inaudible]
non-invasive instrumentation

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.780
as well as the application
of various instruments

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.230
to include the analysis
of a wide range

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.970
of heritage materials.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.560
Of course, collections such
as music include materials

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.280
such as glass, metal, wood, and
a combination of organic plant

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.320
and animal materials
as well as inorganics.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.610
This research into understanding
the degradation mechanisms

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.500
of many materials
necessitates this use of a lot

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.360
of complimentary analyses and
these have been a key part

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.140
of what we have been working
on in the lab ourselves

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.770
and we do really want to
acknowledge the techniques

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.150
that we don't have in
our lab and the expertise

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.180
of our colleagues who
are working with us.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.520
I am going to go ahead and
start by introducing all

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.040
of the speakers at the
beginning and then we will flow

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.750
through the three talks
with the various speakers

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.440
and if one could hold their
questions until the end

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.570
of the three talks,
if you need to,

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.330
scribble it down on your iPhone,

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.710
but please if you [inaudible]
then can turn your iPhones off--

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.840
The three titles of the talk,
as I said the first talk

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.140
by the first four speakers
Collaborative Technical Studies

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:08.900
of Claude Laurent's glass
flutes, The Auloi of Meroë:

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.530

and I now with pleasure handover
to our first presenters.

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:40.380
[ Applause ]

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.950
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
Good afternoon,

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.620
welcome to the Science
Meets Music.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.160
As Fenella introduced, I
am Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.420
from the Music Division
at the Library of Congress

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.160
and I am delighted to be
a part of the team setting

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.880
and presenting today's
Collaborative Technical Study

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.580
of Claude Laurent's
glass flutes.

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.030
I am incredibly grateful
to the Library of Congress

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:06.420
and its Preservation
Directorate,

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.250
the National Endowment
for the Humanities,

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:11.080
and my fellow collaborators
at George Washington

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.760
and Catholic Universities.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.560
And without a doubt my deepest
thanks goes to the donor

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.440
of the flute collection,
Dayton C. Miller,

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.320
whose inquisitiveness
intersected with his professions

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.370
in music and science and his
flute collection continues

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.530
to inspire.

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:37.470
So a little background,
a few years ago,

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:41.040
on what seemed a normal day for
me at work at the flute vault,

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.890
I had pulled up a drawer and
searched the drawer to look

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:48.070
at some of the 18 crystal
flutes that we have,

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:52.060
and I realized they
weren't all crystal clear,

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.210
some appeared foggy.

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:55.820
I quickly shut the drawer

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:59.460
and thought was I
storing them incorrectly,

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:03.260
what was it in the glass
that was causing this,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.760
how long has this been going on?

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:10.290
I peeked in and again I
wondered what was I going

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:11.790
to do about this?

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:16.490
Fortunately, I had met Fenella,
a scientist and a flutist,

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:19.260
and soon thereafter Lynn
Brostoff and I began working

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.950
on our historical
and technical study

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:24.050
of the Laurent glass flutes.

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:27.900
This involved a new assessment
of the flutes and understanding

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.110
of the flute maker,
Claude Lauren,

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:33.680
his manufacturing methods,
the causes of the fogginess,

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:37.490
how to arrest the causes, and
how to stabilize the flutes.

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:43.890
In 1806, Claude Laurent of
Paris invented and patent a

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:47.800
"flutes en cristal"-- in
crystal or of crystal,

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.390
a material he claimed was more
stable than wood and ivory,

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:54.960
which were currently
popular in flute manufacture.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.460
He made the flutes
between 1805 in a variety

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:02.060
of materials, key
work, and colors.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:05.100
The location of his
gallery is depicted here

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.900
in the Palais-Royal, which was
bustling with other craftsmen,

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:12.980
including his silversmith,
one of them Jean Dupont.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:15.740
The flutes were extremely
popular and sent

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:19.700
to quite a few world leaders
including the one we held here

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.490
in the Miller collection which
was sent to President Madison

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:25.010
on the occasion of
his second term.

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:28.390
Prior to our research
and despite the appeal

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:31.520
of the Laurent flutes, little
was known or understood

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:36.130
about the glass flutes or
the maker or his workshop.

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:38.520
We uncovered his town of birth,

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.280
his baptismal day,
and his death day.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.340
We also created a
website and database

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:48.160
of approximately 185
flutes known or manufactured

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.190
on building upon Dayton C.
Miller's original list of 40,

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:54.640
and through technical analysis,

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.590
we also uncovered the
composition of the glass

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:00.960
but more on that later.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.290
And now meet the
collector, Dayton C. Miller,

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:07.620
where a scientist meets
musical instrument.

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:12.270
Miller was a flute fanatic,
a flutist, a flute composer,

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:15.170
a flute maker, a flute
researcher, a flute collector,

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:19.340
and a scientist at Case
Western for over four decades.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:23.350
His careers in acoustics and
physics led him to experiment

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:26.120
with the acoustics of sound
and here he is depicted

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.820
in the middle in the
invention of the Phonodeik.

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:34.010
He invented this with which he
studied the overtones produced

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:36.650
by flutes of various materials.

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:39.880
Also showing here is the
picture from one of his ledgers

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.380
with detailed observations
that he took on all

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.780
of his flutes including
the glass flutes.

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:48.290
Along with his huge archive of
flute-related correspondence,

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:52.560
books and photographs, which he
donated to the library in 1941,

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:56.270
and his 1925 publication
on the flutes of glass

00:10:56.270 --> 00:11:00.320
and that started us on our
journey that continues today.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.240
And now I will turn this story

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.510
of the journey over
to Stephanie.

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:19.220
[ Background Discussion ]

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.520
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Zaleski: Okay.

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:21.870
I assume everyone
can hear me okay?

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:24.030
Good, all right.

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:29.900
So in spirit of Dr. Miller who
I would also want to add was one

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:33.710
of the first American scientists
who experimented with x-rays,

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:35.760
which is really interesting.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:40.160
We undertook the
study, Technical Study

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.640
of the Laurent flutes.

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:45.100
Here on the slide, I have an
example of one of the ones

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:47.810
in the collection, and as
you can see, there is a--

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:51.050
this fogginess that Carol Lynn
talks about but it also varies

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:53.770
in joints, so something that
we needed to take into account

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:56.020
when we were actually
doing the analysis.

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.180
So undertaking this,
we had the goals

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:00.690
of understanding
how these were made.

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:02.630
Again like Carol Lynn said,

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:06.060
these weren't really
studied before so that is one

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:07.650
of the things that
we [inaudible].

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:11.010
We also wanted to know what
these flutes were made out of

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:13.850
since they were supposedly
"en cristal".

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:17.750
We also are assessing the
condition using microscopic

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:20.880
examination and this
all contributes

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:24.710
to determining what the causes
of glass deterioration are

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:26.590
as well as the different
types of risk factors

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:29.560
that we can experience,
and we were fortunate

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:34.480
to have an NEH grant from the
Preservation and Access Division

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.470
to create a simple
analytical toolkit

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:41.690
that can help us assess
glass type and condition.

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:46.590
And so pertaining
to our question

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:49.040
of how these flutes
were actually made,

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.220
I hope that the animation
that I have

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:52.940
on here is actually working.

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:57.640
We brought two flutes that
were made in 1819 and 1828

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.600
to the Radiology Department

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.530
at the George Washington
University Hospital.

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:05.430
And what is really amazing
about this technique is

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:09.970
that here you see 0.6
millimeters slices,

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:12.620
axial slices, and the data taken

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:16.120
for these two flutes was
actually done under two minutes.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:20.370
And so what I show here is I
have a program that I developed

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:23.770
where it detects circles, so
you have an inner diameter

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:27.270
and an outer diameter, and
the plot below the animations,

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:29.580
again that are just scrolling
through the head joints,

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:32.850
so it's really amazing as you
can actually see the tone holes,

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:36.580
you can see the ridges, but what
is amazing here is despite the

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:39.040
fact that these were made
almost a decade apart

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:42.020
that the calculated
inner diameter is

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:45.820
about 17.9 millimeters.

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:47.720
And if we move on to
the upper body joint,

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:53.840
you can see that there is a
very regular stepwise decrease

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:57.350
in the inner diameter of the
joint and the interference

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:01.760
that you see in 1819 is actually
because the metal fittings

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:05.120
and keys on the flutes actually
produced slight interference

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.030
in the CT scan.

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:08.580
Regardless, we started off

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:12.930
at around 17.5 millimeter inner
diameter working the way down to

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:17.570
about 14.5 in exactly
half millimeter steps.

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:21.590
So this tells us that these
flute makers knew exactly what

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:26.000
type of sound they were trying
to produce and they had a method

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.240
for actually fabricating
these instruments.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:31.880
And just again to really
drive that point home,

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:36.040
with the lower body joint,
we see a same exact trend

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:39.520
where the measured inner
diameter of these starts

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:43.790
around 14 millimeters and,
in half millimeter steps,

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:47.650
goes down to about 11.5.

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:51.290
So it's really amazing because
what we can now do is use this

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:54.800
information to reconstruct
the idea about the tone

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.980
and the sound of
these instruments,

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:58.280
and we are also looking

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:02.130
at hopefully scanning earlier
flutes as well as later flutes

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:05.660
to see if there was a change
in the manufacturing process.

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:09.250
So, of course, not
only are we interested

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:12.420
in understanding how they were
made but what they were made

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:16.690
out of and here I show the two
major techniques that we used

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:20.100
to determine composition
of the Laurent flutes.

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:23.160
We can use UV light and I will
show these are just two head

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:26.670
joints under visible light, but
if we use a UV light source,

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:29.430
different metallic species

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:32.560
in the glass will
fluoresce certain colors,

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.830
and with non-invasive
x-ray fluorescence,

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:39.020
we can actually get an
elemental fingerprint

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:41.020
without actually
having to take a sample.

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:44.470
And so under UV light,
you can see

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:47.440
that these head joints are
very clearly different,

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:51.190
and so 611 has this
characteristic green yellow

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:54.520
color, which is indicative of
manganese used in the glass,

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:57.380
which was actually used
a decolorizing agent due

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:00.920
to the iron in some of the
raw materials for the glass.

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:04.230
And the pink color of 378,
which is actually the head joint

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:07.830
of the-- what we call the James
Madison flute is indicative

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:09.300
of there being a leaded

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.460
or crystal formulation
in the glass.

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:15.160
And you can see that the
labeled elements that we have

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:19.420
in the x-ray fluorescence
spectra agree very well

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:24.540
with what we find with our
eyes using the UV analysis.

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:29.720
And so analytical techniques,
especially these simple ones

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:33.310
that we are trying to develop
can help us understand how

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:38.280
composition actually relates
to observed deterioration.

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.290
So, in the Dayton C. miller
collection, this fogginess

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:44.810
that Carol Lynn talked about
is actually the endemic symptom

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:47.410
of advanced glass deterioration.

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:50.880
And in this very
extreme case for 717,

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.300
you can actually very
visibly see it with your eyes,

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:56.190
you can see some cracking,
you can see spalling,

00:16:56.190 --> 00:17:00.110
which is actually a loss of the
uppermost reacted glass layer.

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:02.290
But here I just want to
outline some of the techniques

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:03.590
that we are exploring

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:06.840
to actually really get a
quantitative understanding

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:09.340
of the observed glass
deterioration.

00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:11.350
So we can use a technique
called FORS,

00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:14.230
which is Fiber Optic
Reflectance Spectroscopy,

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:17.140
is a molecular fingerprinting
technique

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:20.870
and here we are interested
in peaks that are associated

00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:24.850
with water and hydroxide,
which is actually a marker

00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:29.960
of glass deterioration of
this silicate SiOH network.

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:33.700
We can all see the surface
pH because with the formation

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:36.640
of hydroxide you will
have an increase in pH,

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.770
so a more alkaline
environment on the surface,

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:43.540
and that just shows
with increasing pH,

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:47.250
we know that there is more
progressive deterioration.

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:53.540
And lastly, using
the expertise of GW,

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:55.770
we are doing image analysis.

00:17:55.770 --> 00:18:00.000
We are actually trying to
give a quantitative measure

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.720
to texture rather than just
using a qualitative assessment

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:07.690
by eye and so different degrees
of cracking or different types

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:10.740
of features will actually give
you a different quantitative

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:13.910
measure of texture.

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:20.090
And actually we found that we
can use the non-invasive XRF

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:24.360
to give us an understanding
about if there is a reacted,

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.310
deteriorated surface layer.

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:30.800
So here I show a chip taken
from one of the joints of 717,

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.950
which Isabelle will elaborate
on in the next section,

00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:36.190
but you can see that there is
a darker layer on the surface

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:37.710
of this in cross-section

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:41.640
and this is actually an
alkaline depleted surface layer.

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:45.800
And if you look at the potassium
composition of the bulk

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:50.120
versus the surface that the
XRF measurements actually very

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:53.920
closely match that to what we
calculate with the surface,

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:57.940
and this is because the
noninvasive XRF is actually very

00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:59.240
surface sensitive.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:02.150
For light elements
such as potassium,

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:04.600
the depth of the sample that
you are actually looking at is

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.000
on the order of about
20 microns.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.880
So, because this is
surface sensitive,

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:11.290
we can usually use
this as a factor

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:15.550
of determining deterioration
in these potash glasses.

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:19.420
And so now that we have all
these data, we actually need

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:25.230
to do something with it, so here
I show sample data for flute 717

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:26.540
in the Dayton C.
Miller collection.

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:30.690
As you can see for each joint,
so it goes from head joint

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:32.670
to foot joint and
the extra joint,

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:34.650
we have all these
different variables

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:38.100
such as the surface pH,
the glass composition,

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:41.780
which includes the percent
surface potassium is what we are

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:45.570
calling it and then other things
such as calcium, manganese,

00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:50.200
iron, lead, and rubidium as
well as the intensity of one

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.770
of the peaks that I have shown

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:54.500
in the Fiber Optic
Reflectance Spectra.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:55.800
We are also working

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:59.020
to incorporate the quantitative
texture measures right now,

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:00.320
so we can take this

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:04.780
data and we can actually
perform different types

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:08.280
of statistical analysis in
order to pull out trends.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.580
So here we are testing

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:12.180
out a technique called
principal component analysis,

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:14.100
which sounds very
fancy and complicated

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:17.630
but essentially what it is
doing is telling us what kind

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:20.340
of variance there
is in our data.

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:24.210
So we can input as many
variables as we like,

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:27.750
but just for this example,
I show flute joint,

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:31.430
the surface pH, the surface
potassium and the calcium

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:33.450
that were calculated by XRF.

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:37.460
So essentially having the
flute joint forces each kind

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:43.250
of cluster-- linear cluster to
be per joint, and so the plot

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:46.350
that I have here of the first
three principal components

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:49.700
describes about 90% of the
variance and variability

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:53.150
in the numbers that we
see in this database.

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:55.880
And so we see by
these blue lines,

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.230
which are actually
vectors, which tell us

00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:01.370
about how each variable
contributes to the variance

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:04.080
that we observe that
they are actually going

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.380
in opposite directions.

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:09.510
So this actually implies
that the pH and the surface--

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:13.050
the calculated surface
potassium are inversely related.

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:17.130
So, if we actually go down
for each liner joint cluster

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:20.270
and do a relative ranking, we
can see that there is a decrease

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:22.870
in the pH and increase
in potassium,

00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:25.160
which we are now working
on actually seeing

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.050
if how the ranking compares

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:33.210
to previous qualitative
assessments by a conservator.

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:35.950
In addition, this is
a separate technique,

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:37.250
but what we are doing is--

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:41.760
can we actually predict the
condition of these flutes

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.590
by using a cluster analysis.

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:49.050
So, again, here we have a
relative ranking now based

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:51.680
on a more quantitative
understanding of the data

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:55.060
such as the surface pH, the
potassium, and the degree

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:58.480
of micro-cracking that we see on
the surface and we can give it--

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:01.240
essentially what is
a score in this case.

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.880
And you can see that
the red points,

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:06.880
which are what we consider
to be unstable glasses,

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:11.640
do cluster out fairly well from
the at risk or stable glasses.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.280
And we see, you know,
again, what I showed

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:15.740
in the previous slide is

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:18.980
that unstable glasses
have low surface potassium

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:22.900
and typically more alkaline
pH. And running this

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:26.520
through a classification
predictive creating a model,

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:28.380
so far we have been
able to obtain

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.200
about 80% accuracy from this.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.860
So this is a really
promising way of, you know,

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:38.580
creating a database of what we
know to be deteriorated or not,

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:41.740
being able to share this
information with other folks

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:44.230
that have these types of
instruments is really valuable

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:46.250
for preserving these
collections.

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:48.020
And we are hoping
that the model studies

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:49.560
that Isabelle is
now going to talk

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:54.050
about will further inform our
assignments of these rankings

00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:57.280
and really have a feasible
understanding of what is going

00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:07.180
on with the deterioration
in these flutes.

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:11.380
&gt;&gt; Isabelle Muller: So,
the fun started for us

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:15.680
at the Vitreous State Lab of the
Catholic University in the fall

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:20.180
of 2014 when, you
see on this image--

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:23.110
on this photo, my
colleague, Dr. Buechele,

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:26.900
sitting at the microscope
and taking a little sample

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:29.990
of 500 micron-- that
is a huge piece

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:34.190
of this flute, two little chips.

00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:38.930
And we actually included in
the fun, a high school student

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:42.940
who worked with us all year
long during her senior year

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:46.040
as a high school student
in Montgomery County

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:50.610
and that was really
exciting for her as well.

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:54.060
So this is flute 717, the one

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:56.170
that Stephanie showed
you earlier

00:23:56.170 --> 00:23:58.550
and you can see where
we sampled.

00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:02.620
This is taken at the very
bottom of the "v" groove,

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:06.700
the creative grooves
that you have seen

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:10.320
in the larger photo
of the flute before.

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:13.660
We were also able to
sample from another flute

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:17.400
which was not showing any
sign of damage in terms

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:21.130
of chemical alternation

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:26.060
but there was extra flute
joints that we could sample.

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:31.990
You can see here a scouring that
helped us take this whole piece.

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:37.880
So with this huge piece of
over 50 milligram of 1235,

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:41.980
we were able to take multiple
corroborative analytical

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:49.100
measurements as well as scanning
electron microscope analysis.

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:52.680
But with the duplicate analysis
we were making sure we were not

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:57.190
missing any element in the
composition of this flute.

00:24:57.190 --> 00:25:00.760
And then, of course, we had
those two little chips of 717

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:03.470
for scanning electron
microscope as well.

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:06.910
What we learned then
with those tiny chips is

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:13.650
that this glass is simply
potassium silicate with 2%

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:20.510
of calcium and a lot bit of
sodium, absolutely no lead.

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:23.770
This is not surprising
because in the 1800

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:28.770
to 1850s there was a glass
that was extremely popular

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:32.860
because it was very brilliant
and very hard and very easy

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:36.640
to do nice decorative
engraving and that was known

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:41.730
as bohemian crystal, not
what we call crystal today

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:43.560
which is leaded.

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:46.310
We also were able to
do a nice polishing,

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:50.610
so this is a back
scattered image

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:56.600
of the two little chips of 717.

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:59.940
You are looking here at
the top part of the sample.

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:03.910
So this section is what
the exterior of the flute

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:06.470
and then this is the
interior of the flute,

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:10.450
and here in this very
nicely magnified image,

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:13.040
you can see clearly
that the surface--

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:18.160
the upper surface of the flute
has about 30 micron of a layer

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:21.870
that is of a different
composition.

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:25.380
And this is what happens if you
look at the chemical composition

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:27.830
of each of those
spots we analyzed.

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:32.180
Coming from the outside
with 2.5 micron spots,

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:35.900
we can see that the potassium
is very much depleted,

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:39.410
around 5 atomic percent by
weight here and it rises

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:44.030
to about 16 in the core of the
flute, we have a sharp rise;

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:49.120
same depletion with the sodium,
so both of those alkali depleted

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:53.470
in the surface as a result
of the so called leaching

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:56.980
of the glass or reaction
with humidity.

00:26:56.980 --> 00:27:01.260
While this is a well
known phenomenon,

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:04.070
which we call the
interdiffusion,

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:08.060
so here I have a little
cartoon of a glass structure

00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:12.660
which is the silicon
and the oxygen in red.

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:14.960
Those oxygen that
link the silicon

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:18.730
to each other are what we
call the bridging oxygen

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:23.420
and then some of those
oxygen are remaining open

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:25.700
so that they provide
charge balance

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:29.690
to what we call the glass
modifier, the sodium,

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:32.330
the potassium or the calcium.

00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:37.680
And what is happening is the
water makes available a proton

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:42.610
that is going to sit in place
of this alkali causing it

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:46.300
to diffuse outside with the
equations I have marked here.

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:48.010
And you can see that as a result

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:53.880
of that you will have a slightly
increased pH at the surface

00:27:53.880 --> 00:28:00.680
and that is what we see.

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:01.980
[background discussion] So now

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:05.140
that we understand what
is happening in the flute,

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:08.210
we want to try to
replicate it in the lab

00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:09.650
so that we can play games

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:13.460
because unfortunately Carol
Lynn is not giving us the flute

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:17.200
to play with, more
than the 500 micron.

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:20.700
So of those two flutes
that we have here analyzed

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:24.610
in the first two columns,
we made three replicas--

00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:27.140
I say replica because
they really include all

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:31.580
of the minor components of
the 717, high in potassium,

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:37.500
the 1235, and another flute
that is high leaded glass.

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:43.150
But we also bridged the gap
between 717 and 1235 with steps

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:46.030
of half percent potassium.

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:48.820
And this is the table of all
the composition we measured

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:52.290
to verify that we actually made
the glass we wanted to make.

00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:54.300
This is how we made it-- this
is Rhea [assumed spelling] our

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:56.370
intern making the glass.

00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:59.410
All of the ingredients are
put in a platinum crystal ball

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:05.640
at 1450 Celsius for
up to 4 hours of melt

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:10.670
and then the crystal ball
is quenched into cold water

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:14.820
to avoid any crystallization
of the glass melt.

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:19.100
And this very fast cooling
induces stress in the glass

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:20.400
that will cause it

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:24.070
to spontaneously break
into tiny pieces.

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:27.400
So we take those tiny
pieces and we put them back

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:31.640
into a [inaudible] crucible so
we could create a thin slice--

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:35.680
it looks like a coin of
about 3 millimeter thick,

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:38.230
which we have very
carefully annealed

00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:40.230
so that we could
cut small coupons

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:43.300
that we will be using
in the lab.

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:49.260
And this is the result of
our little games in the lab.

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:53.420
So what you are looking here
are scanning electron microscope

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:58.430
of each of those little
coupon here is now mounted

00:29:58.430 --> 00:30:00.050
in cross-section and then

00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:04.520
we will polish it until
we expose the surface

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:07.140
and we can see what
has been happening

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:09.550
to the glass in cross-section.

00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:13.910
So the black part of each image
here is where the exposure

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:18.640
to the air and the
humidity takes place.

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:25.960
It's actually mounted in epoxy,
so it gives a black image here.

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:29.610
We have two techniques of
accelerating the response

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:34.170
to water aggression or leaching,
the environmental chamber

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:35.770
or the vapor hydration test.

00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:39.320
We started with the vapor
hydration test because we wanted

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:42.460
to see in a very aggressive
environment, but when you speak

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:44.980
of aggressive, this is
a test that was designed

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:49.780
about two decades ago for
testing the glass formulation

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:52.840
that was designed for
the nuclear waste glass

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:54.140
and that was supposed

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:55.630
to demonstrate the
glass will be good

00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:59.080
for a scale of a million years.

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:02.300
So what happened is the
test is normally conducted

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:07.050
at 200 Celsius and a
100% relative humidity,

00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:09.920
and in just a matter
of a few days,

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:12.100
this can of glass was gone.

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:16.060
So we decreased a little
bit the relative humidity,

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:20.660
still we have results
in one or five days

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:23.860
that shows a very
complicated structure

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:28.060
of the alteration layer, very
different from what we see

00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:34.000
in the flute fortunately and
100s of microns of alteration.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.870
So, on the other hand,
the environmental chamber,

00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:40.660
90 Celsius and 90%
relative humidity,

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:44.640
gives us a much nicer
view that does compare

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:47.240
to what we have seen in 717.

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:51.040
In one day, in the environmental
chamber, we see 3 micron

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:55.630
of reacted layer; in
seven days, 65 micron,

00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:59.950
and we can also do an analytical
profile here on the spots

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:03.530
of the electron dispersive
spectroscopy,

00:32:03.530 --> 00:32:09.120
which I plotted here against the
717 I have shown you earlier.

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:14.020
So, this is the real flute
here, which after 200 years,

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:16.450
is about 30 micron altered.

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:21.100
This is our lab replication
in one day or three days,

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:24.870
seven days unfortunately is
going way up there, 63 microns.

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:27.150
So now, we will concentrate

00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:30.890
on environmental chamber
coupon prepared between three

00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:35.690
and five days so that we could
replicate what we have observed

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:37.990
on the flute.

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:42.420
We have some excellent
linear fit of the result.

00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:48.450
The response of how much
of the depths of alteration

00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:54.130
as a function of time are
all very liner and we can see

00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:57.900
that as you move from the
lower potassium content

00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:02.360
to the higher potassium,
the kinetics increase.

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:08.020
Well that increase is
actually a response of--

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:12.570
so this is my low potassium
from one to seven days

00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:14.250
and this is my high potassium.

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:17.160
With only 4% increase
in potassium,

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:20.700
you have actually a response
that is a quadratic response

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:23.120
of potassium, so a square

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:25.580
of how much you increased
the potassium,

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:28.570
which is very important.

00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:32.900
Unfortunately, the VHT
test was too complicated.

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:37.750
We were not able to
really use those results

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:39.100
to simulate the flute.

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:42.090
It showed us that there is
some effective separation.

00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:45.150
However, what was very
useful is we could see

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:50.700
that the leaded glass was a
much slower type of reaction.

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:54.330
So, now, we can concentrate
on that same leaded glass

00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:56.750
in the environmental chamber.

00:33:56.750 --> 00:34:01.250
So these are our findings doing
all of these tests in the lab

00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:07.620
and now I can let my
colleague Lynn [inaudible].

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:11.320
&gt;&gt; Lynn Brostoff:
Thank you Isabelle.

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:17.730
So, as Isabelle mentioned, the
VHT tests were very aggressive,

00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:20.740
and when we looked, we
wanted to come a step back

00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:23.750
and see how does
this experiment--

00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:25.050
will work in the lab compared

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:27.670
to what we are really
seeing on the flutes.

00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:31.840
And so what I show here
are some images we took

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:35.780
under the microscope of two of
the flutes and then images just

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:38.840
of the coupons not in
cross-section obviously.

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:42.100
And those images on
your right are samples

00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:45.600
that were aged artificially
in the environmental chamber

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:48.400
and we were quite excited,
jumping up and down,

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:51.940
when we saw that the cracking
patterns looked so similar.

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:55.410
So this really supports
exactly what Isabelle was saying

00:34:55.410 --> 00:34:59.710
about that these model studies
appear to be good replicates

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:01.980
of what we are seeing naturally.

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:05.750
And I point out that there is
a difference between one day

00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:07.720
and seven days aging in terms

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:11.700
of the actual cracking
pattern going from a kind

00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:15.210
of very fine cracking
to then what looks

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:17.950
like a much denser
network of cracking

00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:21.080
and also separation
between the cracks.

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:24.320
So this looks consistent with
what we are seeing on the flutes

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:28.810
in terms of what we may term an
earlier stage of deterioration

00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:31.550
versus a more advanced stage.

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:37.950
And you may be thinking in your
head, oh yes, that is crizzling,

00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:41.960
well with a very common term
used in the conservation field

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:44.050
to describe glass deterioration.

00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:47.190
And we have looked at quite a
lot of flutes with many people

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:49.740
and we found that everybody
had a different idea

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:51.830
about what crizzling
really means,

00:35:51.830 --> 00:35:55.200
so we are just throwing it
out and we are going to try

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:56.990
and use some more
descriptive language.

00:35:56.990 --> 00:36:04.850
Again stepping back at what
we actually see on the flutes,

00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:08.070
as I said this very light
cracking does appear

00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:11.500
to be consistent with what
we could term an early stage

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:15.520
of deterioration,
however, we-- as I said--

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.160
we have looked at
quite a lot of flutes

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:22.570
and it is actually very hard to
make these condition assessments

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:25.580
with your eyes, even
under the microscope.

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:27.740
And so if you used
the right light

00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:30.610
and you looked very
carefully, you can often find,

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:33.060
as you can see on the
far right, I hope,

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:36.670
some very fine cracking
in the exterior.

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:40.430
But it's very complicated
with these objects

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:43.430
which have different
finishes on the surface.

00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:46.500
And so sometimes you have
a high degree of polish

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:49.480
and a very nice surface,
and on the far left,

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.490
we show a highlighted
flute and we believe

00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:54.880
that is a pristine
surface but in the middle

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:58.710
that is actually a rough
polished surface and you look

00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:02.180
and you look is that
deteriorated, well,

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:03.990
you know, not so easy to tell.

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:06.260
And if it is just a
question of hydration

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:10.560
and Stephanie showed how we can
actually detect hydrated water

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:13.850
in the glass, you are never
going to see it with your eye.

00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:19.090
So this early stage is
quite difficult to assess.

00:37:19.090 --> 00:37:22.380
When you get to severe
cracking, however,

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:25.850
you can definitely see it,
especially under the microscope.

00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:29.780
But when you can see it and when
they are foggy, unfortunately

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:33.570
that means that the
deterioration is very advanced

00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:37.500
and it's difficult to
intervene at that point

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:39.620
to preserve your objects.

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:43.060
And I show here, three
images of flutes that we took

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:47.070
under the microscope, and
this is our friend 717

00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:50.560
but that is obviously the
flute in very bad condition

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:57.090
that we focused on a
lot in our studies.

00:37:57.090 --> 00:38:01.990
So beyond just earlier or
later types of degradation,

00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:05.300
we also noted some other
conditions, and one is looking

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:11.020
for crystalline deposits which
in the literature have been said

00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:13.520
to be an early sign
of deterioration.

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:16.540
So, therefore, we were really
kind of looking for them.

00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:20.930
And we did find all kinds
of material on the interior

00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:24.270
of the flutes and we
did take samples often

00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:27.660
and we did Raman
spectroscopy on those samples.

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:30.920
And on your left,
you can see an image

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:34.420
with some different
material, looks crystalline,

00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:37.900
we took some samples,
and unfortunately all

00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:40.330
of those samples that
we have taken and looked

00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:43.000
at with Raman spectroscopy
have turned

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.960
out to be what I would
call polishing debris.

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:49.980
We found iron oxides which are
likely from jeweler's screws

00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:52.060
and we also found
calcium carbonate

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:56.900
which very well also could
be used as a polishing agent.

00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:59.400
However, our samples
that we aged

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:02.460
in the environmental chamber
are a very good use here,

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:06.670
and on the right, we have a very
high magnified image looking

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:12.920
right in a crack of a quite
deteriorated model sample,

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:17.090
this is a replica glass,
and there does appear

00:39:17.090 --> 00:39:19.830
to be material inside
the cracks.

00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:23.780
And Stephanie was able to get
a very beautiful Raman spectrum

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:28.110
of that material and in fact it
has a very good identification

00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:31.250
with potassium bicarbonate.

00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:35.390
In that case we can say, yes,
there is a deterioration product

00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:39.340
and may be that is something
that we can even find

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:42.260
or expect could happen.

00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:46.900
And we also had x-ray
defraction done of these coupons

00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:51.950
and what I have circled there
are peaks, so as you should know

00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:55.820
or do know, glass is a
completely amorphous material,

00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:58.220
so normally if you
did x-ray defraction,

00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:00.050
you would just have that big

00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:03.960
lumpy peak there but there
are some very sharp peaks

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:05.330
and that is indicating

00:40:05.330 --> 00:40:07.930
that there is some
crystalline material,

00:40:07.930 --> 00:40:14.330
and as the percent potassium
increased in the samples,

00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:17.480
you see more of it and this
is something that is happening

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:20.870
with artificial aging and
not something to expect

00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:24.320
in an early stage of
deterioration in these glasses.

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:28.560
Although we have not seen
it yet, it is something

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:34.650
that we possibly could find in
very deteriorated materials.

00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:38.760
There is another condition that
is a very important condition

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:43.030
and we know from what is
known about glass leaching

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:45.920
and from our model samples
that we could expect

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:51.390
to develop an alkaline surface
on the flutes themselves,

00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:54.090
and on occasion,
we have seen flutes

00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:57.410
that do have visible
liquid alkaline drops

00:40:57.410 --> 00:40:59.580
and this is often
called weeping.

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:01.610
Again we are trying to get
away from these type kind

00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:04.700
of jargony terms since
not everybody uses

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:06.360
them consistently.

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:12.040
We only, out of our 19 flutes,
have only seen one flute

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:17.210
and only one of its joints that
has this condition, and I think,

00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:19.850
you can see it pretty
well in the images

00:41:19.850 --> 00:41:24.430
that I show there are these
teeny, tiny, dew-like droplets,

00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:28.750
and we also on that same flute
see what appears to be a kind

00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:30.640
of pitting which
could have occurred

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:35.170
from the droplets drying after
they had acted corrosively

00:41:35.170 --> 00:41:38.310
on the surface but that can also
happen from water in cleaning.

00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:43.590
So, we suspect-- and this did
not happen on our model samples

00:41:43.590 --> 00:41:47.270
and we suspect this could
be another mechanism

00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:50.120
that involves the
hydration of the glass

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:52.030
and then a sudden
change in humidity

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:56.180
that can cause this
phenomenon to occur.

00:41:56.180 --> 00:42:01.690
And we are doing some new
experiments to verify that now.

00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:05.000
And so if we put these
observations together

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:10.430
with our observations on the
model glass, we actually see

00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:13.350
that the model studies are
supporting what we see quite

00:42:13.350 --> 00:42:17.680
well, and just comparing
them kind of side by side,

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:22.540
it's very important that we have
the model studies support the

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:27.050
observation that the high leaded
glass flutes are quite stable

00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:28.850
compared to the potash
glass flutes

00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:31.110
because we only had
two here to look at.

00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:33.060
So it would have been
very difficult to make

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:36.630
that conclusion, but now
that we have model studies,

00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:39.680
I think we can say
that pretty safely.

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:41.390
We also saw right off the bat

00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:43.010
that we had a very
high incidence

00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:46.740
of deterioration among
the potash glass flutes.

00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:48.550
And the model studies
are predicting

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:50.860
that the actual amount
of potassium

00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:54.300
in the base glass is
itself a predictor

00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:57.950
of the inherent instability
in the glass itself

00:42:57.950 --> 00:43:00.960
and that is quite important.

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:03.930
We have seen little or
no crystalline deposits

00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:06.800
on the flutes themselves,
which is not what is predicted

00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:10.990
in the literature, and what the
model studies are telling us is

00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:13.050
that that is something
that we should associate

00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:16.390
with very late stage
deterioration and may

00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:20.170
or may not occur
eventually in these objects.

00:43:20.170 --> 00:43:24.710
And as I just said we can
have this other phenomenon

00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:28.250
of liquid alkaline drops and
we have taken pH measurements

00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:31.320
of the drops themselves
and they are like 10,

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:34.880
so they are extremely corrosive.

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:39.150
And all of this work
together really helps us

00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:41.260
to understand what is
going on in the flutes

00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:45.610
and really does justify all the
trouble and expense that we go

00:43:45.610 --> 00:43:50.500
to and have gone to at the
library to design new storage

00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:52.990
for the flutes and that is

00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:56.750
because the environmental
factor is very important

00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:58.050
and can't be ignored.

00:43:58.050 --> 00:44:00.280
We are doing artificial
aging and we do think

00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:03.880
that it is reflecting what goes
on in the flutes very well,

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:07.130
however, that was
at steady conditions

00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:09.330
and very controlled conditions,

00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:12.640
and of course these flutes have
had a life with different owners

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:15.860
and different museums and have
been exhibited a lot or not

00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:18.950
or have been in a drawer
and they have been exposed

00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:22.480
to different conditions and that
probably is the deciding factor

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:25.360
of the condition that
they are in given

00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:28.200
that they have inherent
instability.

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:33.250
And we would like to point
out again with our flute 475,

00:44:33.250 --> 00:44:35.040
which Stephanie showed before,

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:38.180
that in the four joints we
can actually see different

00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:41.770
conditions and you can see that
in this beautiful photograph

00:44:41.770 --> 00:44:45.770
by the fogginess in the
head joint, which is on top,

00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:49.540
and then on the third one, which
would have been an extra joint

00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:51.680
that was made for
a change in pitch

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:56.520
that was probably put away,
okay, we are theorizing,

00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:58.870
but it is in a pristine
condition.

00:44:58.870 --> 00:45:00.930
And these four joints were made

00:45:00.930 --> 00:45:04.150
with roughly the
same formulation.

00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:06.400
And so it is really
a beautiful example

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:11.170
of how the environment can
affect the condition including

00:45:11.170 --> 00:45:14.090
the player's breath and so we
have often seen the head joints

00:45:14.090 --> 00:45:16.080
to be in worse condition
and we think that is

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:19.560
because of the increased
exposure to moisture

00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:22.620
from the breath of the flutist.

00:45:24.310 --> 00:45:28.220
So, in summary, we do want
to point out for anyone

00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:31.530
who has a flute and
looks at it themselves

00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:33.040
that it can be very difficult

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:36.130
to assess the condition
just with the eye.

00:45:36.130 --> 00:45:38.590
And we have come up
with some tools and many

00:45:38.590 --> 00:45:41.600
of them are very simple, and
we are very proud of that

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:44.300
that can be used to supplement
what you see with your eye

00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:47.660
that can really help assess
whether you have an unstable

00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:50.730
material and what
condition it's in.

00:45:50.730 --> 00:45:53.090
And of course, we
feel very strongly

00:45:53.090 --> 00:45:55.670
that the interdisciplinary
aspect

00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:58.040
of our research has
added tremendous value

00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:00.810
to what we understand about
these flutes including

00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:03.350
to what we understand
about Laurent himself,

00:46:03.350 --> 00:46:07.070
who was not just an
innovator and a craftsman

00:46:07.070 --> 00:46:08.990
but definitely a businessman

00:46:08.990 --> 00:46:12.830
because the bottom line was
probably the cost of making

00:46:12.830 --> 00:46:16.290
that flute [laughter]
and we believe

00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:20.410
that is probably why he made
the potash glass substitutes.

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:25.440
And I just did want to conclude
with one more second here

00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:28.610
about the fact that you
know we have been doing this

00:46:28.610 --> 00:46:32.000
for four years-- this research--
and you know, I really--

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.370
I sat down and I said to
Carol Lynn what have we learnt

00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:40.950
and I was so happy to hear that
as a curator, Carol Lynn feels

00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:44.850
that she has gained so much
in terms of learning how

00:46:44.850 --> 00:46:47.730
to ask questions
and to better think

00:46:47.730 --> 00:46:51.740
about the material properties
of an individual object

00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:57.290
when she is the caretaker,
and of course never

00:46:57.290 --> 00:47:00.060
to assume because,
as we all know,

00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:03.260
these flutes are still
listed in most catalogues

00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:06.970
as crystal flutes,
so we now know

00:47:06.970 --> 00:47:10.100
that the actual story
is quite different.

00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:11.460
But the scientists, I think,

00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:14.230
we all have learned
different things as well

00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:17.550
and not just how rewarding it
is to participate in the care

00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:21.470
of historical objects but
the importance of expanding

00:47:21.470 --> 00:47:24.230
on our understanding of
something that you know a lot

00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:26.600
of people would say, oh, we
know how glass deteriorates,

00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:28.170
that is all completely
done already,

00:47:28.170 --> 00:47:31.890
what are you spending your time
on that for, but every type

00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:34.980
of object is different and
I think we have learnt a lot

00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:36.930
about how these may
be deteriorating

00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:41.780
in a slightly different way and
that we should also notice it,

00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:43.580
so thank you, that's it.

00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:54.630
[ Applause ]

00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:56.910
&gt;&gt;Fenella France: And
without further ado,

00:47:56.910 --> 00:47:59.620
our second speaker,
Jayme Kurland.

00:48:02.310 --> 00:48:04.900
&gt;&gt; Jayme Kurland: Good
afternoon, I am very happy

00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:06.840
to be here and I would
like to thank the Library

00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:09.130
of Congress for the invitation.

00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:12.810
I also must thank my
coauthors who I wish were here

00:48:12.810 --> 00:48:15.640
because they did much of
the scientific research

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:18.860
on these objects but
I hope to be able

00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:21.010
to share their work with you.

00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:23.380
My name is Jayme Kurland,
I worked at the MFA

00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:26.560
as a curatorial research
fellow in musical instruments

00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:28.640
for the last four years.

00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:30.480
When I began working
with the collection,

00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:33.990
my first project was
working on a project related

00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:35.290
to the auloi of Meroë.

00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:38.080
I am happy to share the
progress my colleagues

00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:39.920
and I have done on this project.

00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:44.550
When we set out on this journey,
we did not know what to expect.

00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:47.420
We hoped to learn more
about these instruments

00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:51.820
and hopefully create replicas
but we have learnt so much more.

00:48:55.650 --> 00:48:59.930
An aulos or the plural auloi
were the principal wind

00:48:59.930 --> 00:49:02.120
instruments from antiquity,

00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:04.980
also known to the Romans
as tibia or tibiae.

00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:08.770
The instruments have double
reeds like modern oboes

00:49:08.770 --> 00:49:10.560
and were played in tuned pairs

00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:15.290
with one pipe primarily playing
a melodic line while the other

00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:17.290
would play the drone.

00:49:17.290 --> 00:49:20.140
Unlike a modern wind
instrument that uses both hands

00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:22.670
on one pipe, aulos players

00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:26.600
or auletes can only use one hand
per instrument limiting their

00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:28.610
melodic options.

00:49:28.610 --> 00:49:31.550
Early aulos finds are
made of wood or bone often

00:49:31.550 --> 00:49:34.490
with metal reinforcement
over the joints

00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:37.300
but construction
evolved over time.

00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:40.630
By the Hellenistic and
Roman imperial periods,

00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:42.910
mechanically sophisticated
systems were made

00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:46.220
of various metals,
bone, and wood.

00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:49.640
We see here the various
mechanisms

00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:52.610
that we have seen
on the MFA's auloi.

00:49:52.610 --> 00:49:55.790
The fragments have
either a bone or wood core

00:49:55.790 --> 00:49:59.020
with two fitted bronze
sleeves surrounding the core.

00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:00.320
The bronze sleeves

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:04.550
measure about 0.3
millimeters thick or less.

00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:09.060
The top of the instrument
features a bone bulb,

00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:11.470
which served as the reed insert,

00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:13.360
and the flared bell
would be located

00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:15.560
at the end of the instrument.

00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:16.860
There are various types

00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:19.780
of advanced mechanisms
including sliders,

00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:22.430
rotating cuffs, and chimneys.

00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:26.030
Unlike modern woodwind
keys that move up and down,

00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:27.330
these sliders would slide

00:50:27.330 --> 00:50:30.430
over the tone hole allowing a
larger pitch [inaudible] given

00:50:30.430 --> 00:50:33.390
the limited size of
the player's hand.

00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:36.190
The sliders could reach
notes out of reach.

00:50:36.190 --> 00:50:39.880
The rotating cuffs could open or
close a given tone hole allowing

00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:44.790
for minor changes
in modality or key.

00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:48.550
Here we see some of the
fragments in further detail.

00:50:48.550 --> 00:50:51.600
On the top left, we see a
cross-section of one fragment

00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:54.600
which clearly shows the bone
core tinted bluish green

00:50:54.600 --> 00:51:00.160
by the corroded metal with
two thin sleeves of bronze.

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:04.370
Next to it, we see a beautifully
cast dolphin holding a scallop

00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:06.200
shell in its mouth.

00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:09.250
This was on top of
a sliding mechanism.

00:51:09.250 --> 00:51:17.070
Now that we have seen the
basic mechanisms and anatomy

00:51:17.070 --> 00:51:19.050
of these instruments, I
would like to take a minute

00:51:19.050 --> 00:51:22.140
to contextualize them
within Greek mythology.

00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:24.180
When I began working
on this project,

00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:27.300
one of my first tasks was
surveying the MFA's collection

00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:30.810
of ancient art searching
for depictions of auloi.

00:51:30.810 --> 00:51:34.450
I was thrilled to find that
the MFA holds over 100 examples

00:51:34.450 --> 00:51:37.430
of iconography featuring
the instruments.

00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:40.970
They are also in various media
including Etruscan painting,

00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:44.180
Greek sculpture, carvings
on coins, and etchings

00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:48.920
on gemstones, and of course
ancient Greek pottery.

00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:54.150
This red figure ceramic bell
krater dating to about from 370

00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:58.230
to 360 BC portrays the
origin story of the auloi.

00:51:58.230 --> 00:52:01.170
The goddess, Athena, who is
said to have created the auloi,

00:52:01.170 --> 00:52:04.390
is seen playing the
instrument under an olive tree.

00:52:04.390 --> 00:52:07.430
While entertaining the Olympian
gods, she becomes embarrassed

00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:10.040
when she discovers how
distorted her face appears

00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:12.330
when blowing the
reeds of the auloi

00:52:12.330 --> 00:52:15.070
and thus casts the
instruments aside.

00:52:15.070 --> 00:52:18.160
Marsyas, a Phrygian satyr,
shown at the far right,

00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:22.050
finds a discarded auloi, claims
them as his own invention

00:52:22.050 --> 00:52:24.950
and becomes famous for
his beautiful playing.

00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:27.980
Apollo, depicted to the right
of the tree, is challenged

00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:31.100
by Marsyas to a godly
battle of the bands.

00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:33.550
The terms of the
competition dictate

00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:36.890
that the winner would choose
the punishment for the loser.

00:52:36.890 --> 00:52:39.610
Both play their instruments
with great skill,

00:52:39.610 --> 00:52:43.480
Marsyas on the auloi and
Apollo on his stringed lyre.

00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:47.650
Apollo challenges Marsyas to
play his instrument upside down,

00:52:47.650 --> 00:52:50.570
while this was down easily on
the lyre, Marsyas was unable

00:52:50.570 --> 00:52:53.070
to play his auloi
in this fashion.

00:52:53.070 --> 00:52:57.280
Serving his judges, the muses
awarded the contest to Apollo.

00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:00.070
As punishment, Apollo
had Marsyas hanged

00:53:00.070 --> 00:53:01.810
from a tree and flayed.

00:53:01.810 --> 00:53:04.460
The pipes of his auloi
reportedly joined

00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:07.510
to his eviscerated body to
create the first bagpipe.

00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:12.480
[ Laughter ]

00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:17.310
Auloi are well documented in
Greek mythology, iconography,

00:53:17.310 --> 00:53:20.550
and event texts including
the Bible, played by both men

00:53:20.550 --> 00:53:22.950
and women, they were
used for celebrations

00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:27.070
such Dionysian festivals
but also for funerary rites,

00:53:27.070 --> 00:53:29.830
which may explain why the
MFA's auloi were discovered

00:53:29.830 --> 00:53:31.730
at a burial site.

00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:35.610
The instruments were often
played alone meaning one player

00:53:35.610 --> 00:53:40.210
playing the two instruments,
not one pipe at the same time,

00:53:40.210 --> 00:53:43.480
but were also used to
accompany singing and dancing.

00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:46.610
The numerous artwork showing
auloi performers not only

00:53:46.610 --> 00:53:48.540
illuminate various
classical myths

00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:51.220
but also provide useful
information regarding how the

00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:53.810
instruments were played
and what their role was

00:53:53.810 --> 00:53:55.280
in the ancient world.

00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:59.130
Due to the physical challenges
of playing two instruments

00:53:59.130 --> 00:54:04.900
at once, a phorbeiá or halter
or mouth strap was used as seen

00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:10.380
in this image to help the player
keep the two instruments in his

00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:15.590
or her mouth but also
helping support the

00:54:17.130 --> 00:54:18.430
player's [inaudible].

00:54:18.430 --> 00:54:21.370
While we know these
instruments were double reeds,

00:54:21.370 --> 00:54:23.580
but due to the reeds
organic materials,

00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:26.370
we have very few
remains of them,

00:54:26.370 --> 00:54:30.570
which were mostly likely
made of Arundo donax,

00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:32.610
a common species of cane.

00:54:32.610 --> 00:54:35.070
Scholars have been using
these native materials

00:54:35.070 --> 00:54:37.210
to ascertain how reeds were made

00:54:37.210 --> 00:54:39.860
and thankfully there are
some iconographic examples

00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:43.010
to show roughly the
shape and size,

00:54:43.010 --> 00:54:46.670
although they aren't completely
accurate in many cases.

00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:50.230
At the top, the photo is
of reeds made by scholars

00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:55.530
at a workshop I went to
in Italy where we tried

00:54:55.530 --> 00:54:58.720
to make these reeds out of
the traditional materials

00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:02.390
but also trying to figure out
how they were made historically.

00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:07.510
As I mentioned before, early
aulos finds are made of bone

00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:10.040
or wood and they didn't
necessarily have many

00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:13.620
mechanisms, if any,
but by the Hellenistic

00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:17.110
and Roman Imperial periods
mechanically sophisticated

00:55:17.110 --> 00:55:20.650
systems were made of various
metals, bone, and wood.

00:55:20.650 --> 00:55:23.740
We see here some extant
examples of the later,

00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:27.190
the more technologically
advanced instruments.

00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:32.440
To understand our
fragments, let's go back

00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:33.740
to when they were found.

00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:37.140
In 1921, a Harvard
University Museum

00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:40.760
of Fine Arts expedition led
by George Andrew Reisner,

00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:44.400
the MFA's curator of Egyptian
art and a Harvard professor

00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:47.530
of Egyptology excavated
the burial site

00:55:47.530 --> 00:55:52.690
of a Nubian queen Amanishakheto
of Meroë in what is now Sudan.

00:55:54.030 --> 00:55:56.360
Amanishakheto, who
reigned between 10

00:55:56.360 --> 00:56:00.180
and 1 BC was a powerful ruler,
and after a period of conflict

00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:03.820
between Meroë and the Roman
Empire, she signed a treaty

00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:06.740
with the Emperor Augustus that
set the stage for a new era

00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:10.780
of trade and communication
between the two powers.

00:56:10.780 --> 00:56:14.120
Kingdom of Meroë was
a metropolitan center

00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:18.280
for trade along the Nile River
Valley and near the Red Sea

00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:21.400
which saw cultural exchange with
people from the Mediterranean

00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:23.800
and Western and Central Asia.

00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:27.130
Other artifacts found in the
area show an advanced level

00:56:27.130 --> 00:56:30.570
of metropolitan quality
and sophistication.

00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:35.190
Here we see a drawing from
the early 19th century

00:56:35.190 --> 00:56:38.560
of Queen Amanishakheto's
pyramid, and at this point,

00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:40.150
it was very well preserved,

00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:44.230
only with the top part
just a little damaged.

00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:47.780
This burial site
outside the city

00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:50.330
of Meroë had already been
discovered by physician

00:56:50.330 --> 00:56:54.840
and explorer Guiseppe
Ferlini in the 1830s.

00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:56.440
While investigating the pyramid,

00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:59.440
he came upon a treasure
trove of gold.

00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:01.660
Unfortunately, during
his exploration,

00:57:01.660 --> 00:57:04.360
he and his team raided and
destroyed many structures

00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:06.810
on the site and took
dozens of pieces

00:57:06.810 --> 00:57:08.740
of gold and silver jewelry.

00:57:08.740 --> 00:57:11.960
Fortunately for us a
few objects remained.

00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:15.320
There is another photo
of the burial site

00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:19.060
after Ferlini had visited it.

00:57:21.370 --> 00:57:25.820
So in 1921, on his
expedition, George Reisner

00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:27.840
and his team unearthed
the entrance

00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:31.450
to Amanishakheto's burial
chamber at the entrance

00:57:31.450 --> 00:57:35.330
of her tomb and found a large
cash of ancient auloi buried

00:57:35.330 --> 00:57:39.720
in the dirt, at least 12
instruments, thus six pairs.

00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:42.250
Thankfully, Reisner was
one of the first to take

00:57:42.250 --> 00:57:46.100
in situ photography during
excavations and we have a photo

00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:49.760
of these instruments
before they were excavated.

00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:54.030
Unfortunately, they seem to
be have been excavated bit

00:57:54.030 --> 00:57:56.480
by bit instead of
in a whole block,

00:57:56.480 --> 00:58:01.370
thus by the time the
excavation was finished,

00:58:01.370 --> 00:58:04.800
most of the pipes
were in fragments.

00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:07.500
But this grouping of
instruments is one

00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:10.190
of the largest cashes
ever excavated.

00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:12.310
These fragments which
we see here were kept

00:58:12.310 --> 00:58:19.920
in original excavation boxes
until our project began in 2013.

00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:23.150
We also know of other auloi
found nearby in the city

00:58:23.150 --> 00:58:30.840
of Meroë although the example
on one side is an assemblage

00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:34.870
of fragments that were at the
University of Liverpool Museum,

00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:37.410
although we have not
been able to find them,

00:58:37.410 --> 00:58:40.880
and on the other side, we
have a statue of an aulete

00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:44.360
or an auloi player found
in Meroë as well.

00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:48.400
After the instruments were
excavated, they were shipped

00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:52.620
to the MFA in 12 original
excavation boxes with fragments

00:58:52.620 --> 00:58:57.210
of various sizes and shapes in
various stages of degradation.

00:58:57.210 --> 00:58:59.340
Some boxes were lined
with muslin and many

00:58:59.340 --> 00:59:00.890
of these had original
field notes

00:59:00.890 --> 00:59:03.280
in Arabic from the excavators.

00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:08.880
Over the years, a few scholars
came to study these fragments.

00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:12.650
In 1946, Nicholas
Bodley, known to many

00:59:12.650 --> 00:59:14.880
as Nicholas Basarabov
[assumed spelling],

00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:17.990
wrote a very preliminary
report on the fragments.

00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:21.230
And in the early 90s, English
researcher Maurice Burns came

00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:24.010
to study the instruments having
examined many other auloi

00:59:24.010 --> 00:59:26.010
in collections worldwide.

00:59:26.010 --> 00:59:29.520
In 2012, Olga Zukowska
[assumed spelling] came

00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:31.410
and examined the
fragments and urged us

00:59:31.410 --> 00:59:34.210
to consider an in-depth
project focused on them.

00:59:34.210 --> 00:59:39.710
So in 2013, after
receiving generous support

00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:42.750
from museum donors, the
Musical Instrument Department,

00:59:42.750 --> 00:59:45.240
the Department Of Art
In The Ancient World,

00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:47.620
and the Museums Conservation
Department joined together

00:59:47.620 --> 00:59:50.450
to focus our efforts on
the auloi of Meroë.

00:59:50.450 --> 00:59:54.070
Susan Gonsika [assumed
spelling] our conservator,

00:59:54.070 --> 00:59:55.780
triaged the objects and decided

00:59:55.780 --> 00:59:58.440
that we must first
re-house the instruments

00:59:58.440 --> 01:00:00.060
and take high resolution
photography.

01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:04.250
So she created custom
archival acid free boxes

01:00:04.250 --> 01:00:05.810
and rehoused the fragments.

01:00:05.810 --> 01:00:12.100
Although the MFA's fragments
had languished in their boxes

01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:14.660
for almost a century, we
were actually quite lucky

01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:17.470
that earlier irreversible
attempts had not been made

01:00:17.470 --> 01:00:19.070
to conserve them.

01:00:19.070 --> 01:00:21.020
Like several like instruments

01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:23.340
and other collections
were put together long ago

01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:26.110
with irreversible
waxes and resins.

01:00:26.110 --> 01:00:30.160
Our fragments, although severely
corroded, were untouched.

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:33.290
So when Susan was able to see
the fragments on a clean surface

01:00:33.290 --> 01:00:36.990
in the new boxes, she began to
see fragments that were begging

01:00:36.990 --> 01:00:40.530
to be joined together and used
a reversible adhesive solution

01:00:40.530 --> 01:00:42.830
to adhere the pieces.

01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:47.100
She then took the fragments

01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:49.090
to the MFA's conservation
scientists

01:00:49.090 --> 01:00:53.330
to perform various tests
we see here x-ray images

01:00:53.330 --> 01:00:55.620
of several of the fragments.

01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:58.140
One outstanding mystery was
knowing how the cylindrical

01:00:58.140 --> 01:01:01.710
bronze sleeves were
fabricated and the x-ray shows

01:01:01.710 --> 01:01:05.290
that there were no solder seams.

01:01:05.290 --> 01:01:09.200
We think that the seamless
tubes were cast from tin bronze

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:11.240
and then likely further
hammered,

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:13.540
possibly around the metal core.

01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:16.250
Final turning and smoothing
of the surface with the lathe

01:01:16.250 --> 01:01:18.800
like instrument facilitated
the perfect fitting

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:22.010
of the extremely
thin straight tubes.

01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:25.090
As we see distinctive parallel
markings on the metal surface

01:01:25.090 --> 01:01:27.780
that have not been
mineralized by corrosion.

01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:30.400
There were also several
pieces with mysterious

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:33.260
but seemingly purposeful cuts
in the metal, as we see it

01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:34.910
on the bottom part
of this slide.

01:01:34.910 --> 01:01:39.710
As we saw briefly earlier,
this specific scan showed us

01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:43.600
that there were rotating sleeves
adorned with knobs that gave --

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:47.180
allowed a given tone hole
to be opened or closed.

01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:49.450
So they would be turned,
you can't really see it

01:01:49.450 --> 01:01:53.970
but the sleeve would
turn over the tone hole.

01:01:57.050 --> 01:02:00.370
Some of the fragments had
wood cores instead of bone.

01:02:00.370 --> 01:02:02.510
The British Museum's
Carolyn Cartwright,

01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:05.850
an ancient wood specialist,
was able to identify our sample

01:02:05.850 --> 01:02:09.190
as Olea europaea,
European olive tree wood.

01:02:09.190 --> 01:02:13.320
And the radiocarbon
date is between 52 B.C.

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:21.010
and 54 A.D. Metallography
showed redeposited copper

01:02:21.010 --> 01:02:22.700
in some of the tubes.

01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:26.920
And a brown sleeve on
the bone bulb piece

01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:29.890
at right was actually
corroded silver.

01:02:32.590 --> 01:02:35.730
Conservation scientists Michelle
Derrick and Richard Newman

01:02:35.730 --> 01:02:39.300
from the MFA conducted
scanning electron microscopy,

01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:42.330
an energy dispersive
x-ray fluorescence.

01:02:42.330 --> 01:02:46.010
Which gave us a much better
data on the chemical composition

01:02:46.010 --> 01:02:48.770
of the various metals
used in the fragments.

01:02:48.770 --> 01:02:52.610
Thanks to quantitative elemental
analysis on the cross sections

01:02:52.610 --> 01:02:55.050
of the tubing, we learned
that the tubes were made

01:02:55.050 --> 01:02:59.940
of tin bronze with about
90% copper and 10% tin.

01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:01.640
We also took some fragments

01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:05.580
to Massachusetts General
Hospital to be CT scanned.

01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:08.100
Although the -- due to
the high concentrate --

01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:10.820
concentration of metal
we did not see much

01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:12.120
in the resulting images.

01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:14.410
Scanning electron microscopy
imaging also showed fibrous

01:03:14.410 --> 01:03:16.000
materials in one of the holes
of the knobs of a sleeve neck

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.300
of one of the rotating
sleeve mechanisms.

01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:18.600
MFA textile conservator Joel
Thompson identified this

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:20.900
as flax fiber.

01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:27.890
Now as to the purpose of this
there isn't a firm consensus.

01:03:27.890 --> 01:03:34.770
Some think that the fibers would
have served a decorative purpose

01:03:34.770 --> 01:03:42.730
hanging down from the instrument
while others think they might

01:03:42.730 --> 01:03:45.100
have been used to move the
sliding mechanism that was

01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:48.040
out of reach by pulling
the thread.

01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:53.100
So as Susan began to read
and hear more fragments,

01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:55.640
some startling identifications
were made thanks

01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:58.050
to institute photography.

01:03:58.050 --> 01:04:00.900
Susan created this image
which shows a convincing match

01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:02.750
of the fragments in
their current state

01:04:02.750 --> 01:04:04.730
to the excavation photo.

01:04:04.730 --> 01:04:09.570
As the fragments became longer

01:04:09.570 --> 01:04:13.090
with more joins we needed
a better storage solution,

01:04:13.090 --> 01:04:15.700
thus we created this
channeled row configuration

01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:17.960
out of archival ethyl foam,

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:20.380
which allowed longer
joins to be made.

01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:24.620
I should mention that we are
not re-adhering every fragment

01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:27.460
so this arrangement allows
us to show potential matches

01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:29.820
that are either not
stable enough to mend due

01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:32.670
to material loss but
also allows us to try

01:04:32.670 --> 01:04:34.350
out various configurations .

01:04:34.350 --> 01:04:41.730
In 2015 we invited ancient
alloy specialist Stefan Hoggle

01:04:41.730 --> 01:04:45.580
from the Austrian Academy of
Arts and Sciences, Olga Zukowska

01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:49.920
from the European Music
Archaeology Project, EMAP,

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:53.380
along with instrument
maker and engineer

01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:55.930
from Middlesex University,
Peter Holmes to come

01:04:55.930 --> 01:04:57.900
and examine the fragments.

01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:01.460
You see us in the ancient
world library looking at all

01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:05.150
of the boxes of the bits.

01:05:05.150 --> 01:05:09.220
Stefan created schematics which
plotted different ancient modes

01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:13.490
or scales and where the
associated tone holes would be.

01:05:13.490 --> 01:05:16.310
By first lying out the
longer like fragments,

01:05:16.310 --> 01:05:20.080
ones with similar measurements
and materials side by side,

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:23.460
he started to be able to
see musical connections.

01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:26.620
So this is a map of one

01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:29.320
of his schematics showing
the different placement

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:30.770
of where tone holes should be.

01:05:30.770 --> 01:05:34.050
And because of this kind
of schematic he was able

01:05:34.050 --> 01:05:39.490
to also identify where certain
mechanisms would have been

01:05:39.490 --> 01:05:42.970
placed due to the ergonomics
of playing the instrument.

01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:49.410
He then took the data

01:05:49.410 --> 01:05:51.180
and modeled the scales
using software --

01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:53.000
a software program he designed.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.230
His schematics showed
approximate location

01:05:55.230 --> 01:05:58.440
of the holes in relation
to the ancient modalities.

01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:01.330
This allowed him to associate
fragments with missing joins

01:06:01.330 --> 01:06:03.710
and arrangements that
made musical sense.

01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:08.810
Especially in fragments in which
there weren't any very clear

01:06:08.810 --> 01:06:10.630
joins that could be made,

01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:15.450
he was able to estimate what
fragments would fit where.

01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:18.260
Using this technology
he was able

01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:20.790
to better determine the match
pairs of the instruments

01:06:20.790 --> 01:06:22.730
since they would
be in the same mode

01:06:22.730 --> 01:06:25.030
and would be roughly
the same size.

01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:30.410
So this is what we came to.

01:06:30.410 --> 01:06:35.150
Stefan, Susan, Olga, and Peter
were able to find like pairs

01:06:35.150 --> 01:06:38.740
and rest them in what we think
are their proper orientation.

01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:42.870
The long pipes at the bottom
are the longest ever found

01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:45.300
and we have determined that the
dolphin sliders would have fit

01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:46.980
on them, allowing sound
holes out of reach

01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:49.280
to be covered and uncovered.

01:06:52.070 --> 01:06:55.070
So now I'd like to
play a brief video.

01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:07.820
I'm not able to get
to the screen.

01:07:07.820 --> 01:07:10.120
Sorry.

01:07:16.550 --> 01:07:18.850
Yeah.

01:07:22.410 --> 01:07:25.040
So these are instruments
that were 3D printed

01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:27.510
that are very like
our fragments.

01:07:27.510 --> 01:09:32.110
[Music]

01:09:32.110 --> 01:09:35.010
So given all of the
information that we've gleaned

01:09:35.010 --> 01:09:38.870
and now having a basic
type of replica made,

01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:43.400
we hope that Peter Holmes and
Stefan Hoggle will be able

01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:45.070
to create replicas

01:09:45.070 --> 01:09:49.340
of our instruments using
the traditional materials.

01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:55.490
So here's a photo of what one
type of instrument might look

01:09:55.490 --> 01:09:58.050
like using traditional
materials.

01:09:58.050 --> 01:10:02.170
As I come to the end of
my presentation I would

01:10:02.170 --> 01:10:04.780
like to highlight how
wonderful the cross departmental

01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:06.160
collaboration was for us.

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:09.850
I think that all departments,
this was a very unique project

01:10:09.850 --> 01:10:12.770
for the MSA and I don't
think to this date

01:10:12.770 --> 01:10:16.130
so many departments have been
involved in a single project.

01:10:16.130 --> 01:10:18.180
But to have everyone
come together

01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:20.830
and really help us
learn more about one

01:10:20.830 --> 01:10:23.050
of the most important
instruments

01:10:23.050 --> 01:10:26.550
in our collection
was really amazing.

01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:29.320
And it really helped
to have perspectives

01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:32.760
in art history conservation
science and music.

01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:37.610
So we hope to tell this story in
a small exhibition or some sort

01:10:37.610 --> 01:10:41.380
of digital exhibition
in the coming years.

01:10:41.380 --> 01:10:45.850
And with that I'd just like
to say that we continue

01:10:45.850 --> 01:10:49.980
to update our conservation
project page so continue

01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:53.150
to follow our project
there and I look forward

01:10:53.150 --> 01:10:54.480
to answering any
questions at the end.

01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:56.780
Thank you.

01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:14.420
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: And
a third presentation,

01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:18.260
Jean-Philippe Echard, who I
know had significant problems

01:11:18.260 --> 01:11:20.640
and challenges trying
to shrink 15 classes

01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:22.240
of research into this.

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:23.610
We very much look forward to it.

01:11:23.610 --> 01:11:26.070
&gt;&gt; Jean-Philippe Echard:
Thank you, France.

01:11:26.070 --> 01:11:28.430
Thank you, France,
for the introduction.

01:11:28.430 --> 01:11:31.830
Thank you Carol Lynn and
Lynn for the invitation

01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:34.890
to this talk series lecture.

01:11:34.890 --> 01:11:38.970
And thank you to the
Library of Congress.

01:11:42.830 --> 01:11:47.350
We -- I'm from France
so pardon my English

01:11:47.350 --> 01:11:51.880
if it's not totally perfect.

01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:55.030
I work in the city [inaudible].

01:11:55.030 --> 01:12:00.130
Which is in the public
institution dedicated to music

01:12:00.130 --> 01:12:04.340
in France, in Paris
in the Northeast 1977.

01:12:04.340 --> 01:12:11.960
This institution has three
main feet, if I may say.

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:16.900
Dedicated to concerts,
dedicated to education in music

01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:19.750
to a wide range of audiences.

01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:21.950
Kids to adults.

01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:25.810
And also heritage about music.

01:12:25.810 --> 01:12:29.960
It's located very close to
the Conservatoire de Paris

01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:34.710
which has been founded in the,
during the French Revolution.

01:12:34.710 --> 01:12:38.320
I show here one of
the concert halls.

01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:40.330
It's the largest
concert halls we have

01:12:40.330 --> 01:12:43.030
in the institution
in the [inaudible].

01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:45.320
It's La Salle Pierre Boulez

01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:51.360
and we have also two other
smaller concert halls.

01:12:52.650 --> 01:12:58.250
Here are few views of the
gallery of the [inaudible].

01:12:58.250 --> 01:13:02.890
So we exhibit instruments but
also fine arts, collection,

01:13:02.890 --> 01:13:07.910
paintings, sculptures dedicated
to music and presenting music.

01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:11.250
So it's not only a collection
of musical instruments but also

01:13:11.250 --> 01:13:14.610
of art works dedicated to music.

01:13:14.610 --> 01:13:21.360
We have approximately 1,000
pieces on view and for a total

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:25.400
of 7,000, roughly
speaking accession numbers

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:26.720
in the collection.

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:29.440
It is the French
national collection

01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:34.060
of musical instruments on
music related artworks.

01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:37.670
And so it's quite unique
at least in France,

01:13:37.670 --> 01:13:40.560
It's a collection -- I mean,

01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:43.830
for musical instruments it's
a collection that is owned

01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:46.630
by the French nation,
the French people.

01:13:46.630 --> 01:13:51.450
It was created around the French
Revolution without the origin

01:13:51.450 --> 01:13:55.060
of the collection and it
has been growing since.

01:13:55.060 --> 01:14:00.680
Today we have, I show
here a few numbers.

01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:05.480
We -- one thing I could point
out is we are playing instrument

01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:09.530
of the collection that are
played only in the building.

01:14:09.530 --> 01:14:12.780
We have a dedicated
auditorium which you will see

01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:14.810
at the end of my talk.

01:14:14.810 --> 01:14:19.680
250 seats approximately
dedicated to chamber musics

01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:22.110
for instance and
we play instruments

01:14:22.110 --> 01:14:25.450
of the collection there in
a programming, which is part

01:14:25.450 --> 01:14:28.660
of the large program of concerts
of the whole [inaudible].

01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:31.210
So it's, roughly speaking,

01:14:31.210 --> 01:14:37.060
15 concerts a year plus every
two Sunday in the afternoon.

01:14:37.060 --> 01:14:38.550
If you buy your museum ticket

01:14:38.550 --> 01:14:42.800
and you come visit the museum
there are what is called the

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:47.230
[inaudible] with a more informal
way of presenting music concerts

01:14:47.230 --> 01:14:50.820
in the galleries of the museum.

01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:56.520
We also receive specific
visitors which are scholars,

01:14:56.520 --> 01:15:00.370
or musicologist, or
musicians, or instruments maker

01:15:00.370 --> 01:15:03.750
and they come to the
lab, conservation lab

01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:08.520
and they are studying
in death this instrument

01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:13.240
or that instrument to make a
copy to get inspiration of how

01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:17.330
to study for academic research.

01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:21.900
Which you see here,
a group of a school

01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:27.500
from a violin making
school in Germany.

01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:32.410
We in the staff of the
[inaudible], there is a group,

01:15:32.410 --> 01:15:36.540
small department,
dedicated to research.

01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:40.380
So we have a conservation lab,
research, and conservation lab.

01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:44.340
And we are we are also
[inaudible] and an assistant.

01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:49.610
And part of our work
is to perform research.

01:15:49.610 --> 01:15:52.670
And so our research article
activities are educated

01:15:52.670 --> 01:15:57.200
to several fields and
sometimes they interconnects.

01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:01.520
So this is music history in
general but mostly the history

01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:04.930
of the makers, the musician
and the collectors related

01:16:04.930 --> 01:16:07.650
to their musical instruments.

01:16:07.650 --> 01:16:11.600
The history of techniques
of musical instrument making

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:14.660
as part also of the
cultural history.

01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:18.290
So we study, of course, the
materials and the technique

01:16:18.290 --> 01:16:21.020
of elaboration of the
instruments but also

01:16:21.020 --> 01:16:25.020
in their technical
cultural context.

01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:30.220
And sometime it leads to
economics studies or such kind

01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:33.180
of studies which seems
kind of far related

01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:36.910
to the music instrument
making itself.

01:16:36.910 --> 01:16:40.790
We also study, in some cases,

01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:44.230
the way the musical
instrument works.

01:16:44.230 --> 01:16:45.530
How it sounds.

01:16:45.530 --> 01:16:48.570
So these are more
the fields of physics

01:16:48.570 --> 01:16:51.540
and acoustics in particular.

01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:57.140
We study also conservation
like the treatments

01:16:57.140 --> 01:17:00.630
that should be specifically
developed for instruments,

01:17:00.630 --> 01:17:05.770
especially when instruments
are kept in playing conditions.

01:17:05.770 --> 01:17:12.770
And finally, we think and we
work on the heritage values

01:17:12.770 --> 01:17:15.770
of the musical instruments
which are part

01:17:15.770 --> 01:17:17.870
of our cultural heritage.

01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:21.800
It is different to keep and to
preserve musical instruments

01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:27.910
in a national collection like we
do than to conserve instruments

01:17:27.910 --> 01:17:30.720
in your own private
collection when you are musician

01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:32.220
and collecting instruments.

01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:34.480
So it's, these are
not the same things.

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:39.310
And the values that the
society of the owner

01:17:39.310 --> 01:17:44.370
of the instrument attached sees
in the object is not the same

01:17:44.370 --> 01:17:47.460
and we try to consider
this aspect also.

01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:51.250
I forgot to mention, sorry.

01:17:51.250 --> 01:17:54.080
That we are as, a team, part
of a larger [inaudible].

01:17:54.080 --> 01:18:01.930
We are part of the CRC which
is a French Public Research Lab

01:18:01.930 --> 01:18:05.410
of the CNRS agency.

01:18:05.410 --> 01:18:12.160
And CRC is a very important
laboratory for the studio

01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:16.130
of 19 year olds but also
conservation in general.

01:18:16.130 --> 01:18:20.100
And we are part also
of a several consortium

01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:23.680
which allows collaborative
research in terms of history

01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:28.830
of music history but also
other experimental sciences.

01:18:28.830 --> 01:18:32.360
And we you see the logos here.

01:18:33.860 --> 01:18:38.720
So now we can go a little
more in depth and focus

01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:42.630
on the Stradivari violins
in the Paris collection.

01:18:42.630 --> 01:18:46.420
I'm now the curator in charge
of both stringed instruments.

01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:48.610
So these five violins are --

01:18:48.610 --> 01:18:52.660
I'm in charge of among
other instruments.

01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:56.910
And this are very --
this is a nice group.

01:18:56.910 --> 01:18:58.210
You have a nice group

01:18:58.210 --> 01:19:02.240
of Stradivari insurance
here as well.

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:07.110
And it's good these instruments
are in public collections.

01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:11.750
They have been given
by bequest mostly

01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:16.230
to the Paris Conservatoire
Museum in the late 19th century

01:19:16.230 --> 01:19:18.920
and in the early 20th century.

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:20.440
We count -- we are lucky

01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:22.710
to count five instruments
that enter.

01:19:22.710 --> 01:19:27.210
So before 1935 in
the Paris collection.

01:19:27.210 --> 01:19:30.840
We count also other
items by this workshop

01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:32.650
by Antonio Stradivari.

01:19:32.650 --> 01:19:35.640
And this are one
guitar, one of the six

01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:37.810
or seven remaining
details named [inaudible].

01:19:37.810 --> 01:19:44.240
We have also [inaudible]
a very marrow viola named

01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:45.540
the [inaudible].

01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:49.490
And we have also six
molds for [inaudible]

01:19:49.490 --> 01:19:53.270
and smaller instruments
coming from the workshop

01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:58.200
and values fingerboard
and pieces of instruments

01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:00.290
of [inaudible] like
original fingerboard.

01:20:00.290 --> 01:20:04.430
And such tiny instrument
with which are very important

01:20:04.430 --> 01:20:07.570
for the research and
the original state

01:20:07.570 --> 01:20:10.040
of these instruments.

01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:15.010
So among these five Stradivari
violins i will go more

01:20:15.010 --> 01:20:18.780
into detail to talk about the
[inaudible] which is name --

01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:23.120
which is from the year 1708.

01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:31.240
Before that, I am like
France say earlier,

01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:37.500
there were various researches on
the violins at the [inaudible]

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:40.170
so namely researches
on varnishes

01:20:40.170 --> 01:20:44.070
and it was actually my
PhD a few years ago.

01:20:44.070 --> 01:20:48.010
And also the identification
of techniques and ingredients

01:20:48.010 --> 01:20:52.320
that were used to varnish
Stradivari violins but also

01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:55.040
in the technical context
of European vanishing

01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:56.440
of musical instruments.

01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:58.980
So I studied with a team.

01:20:58.980 --> 01:21:02.640
I studied lutes from the
17th century, the varnish.

01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:06.810
Other violins from other
centers of making in Europe

01:21:06.810 --> 01:21:10.880
and to compare all this
in a quite series approach

01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:14.280
or cut copies oriented approach.

01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:21.900
Since 2010 and the end of my
PhD I -- research went on again.

01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:25.710
And I would like to mention
the work of [inaudible]

01:21:25.710 --> 01:21:31.220
who was my PhD student later
and she worked on a specific,

01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:34.420
very specific work
which is of interest,

01:21:34.420 --> 01:21:36.600
especially to violin
makers nowadays

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:41.040
who prepare their own varnish
according to historical recipes.

01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:46.600
We studied the parameters of
like the oil to resin ratio

01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:49.390
because in the chemical
analysis I had performed,

01:21:49.390 --> 01:21:51.010
you couldn't see,

01:21:51.010 --> 01:21:55.080
detect properly the
ratio of the ingredients.

01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:56.390
So she worked on that.

01:21:56.390 --> 01:21:59.080
Studying this parameter
and also the cooking time

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:02.440
and the cooking duration
to prepare the varnish

01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:06.360
and how it would connect
to the coating properties,

01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:08.540
layering properties,
color properties,

01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:17.180
etc. And she was allowed, she
was able to present like a range

01:22:17.180 --> 01:22:21.760
of parameters which --
in which it's possible

01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:25.080
to make a good working varnish
with only two ingredients,

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:29.190
which is drying oil
and fine resins.

01:22:29.190 --> 01:22:32.570
Other -- there are
other topics than vanish

01:22:32.570 --> 01:22:34.440
when we speak about violins.

01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:40.250
And I may mention ongoing
works in the past few years.

01:22:40.250 --> 01:22:43.250
Two works are on wood.

01:22:43.250 --> 01:22:46.220
So identification of
woods and dating of woods.

01:22:46.220 --> 01:22:48.420
And we have been
recently working,

01:22:48.420 --> 01:22:53.570
namely on the purfling woods,
which are tiny bits of wood

01:22:53.570 --> 01:22:57.310
in the board and in the back
of the instruments to try

01:22:57.310 --> 01:22:59.400
to identify the wood species.

01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:03.480
And it's not that easy when
you know the typical scale

01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:08.490
of wood structure compared to
the width, very narrow width

01:23:08.490 --> 01:23:11.890
of the strips of the purflings.

01:23:11.890 --> 01:23:16.400
Another aspect, which is
not experimental science

01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:19.930
but more history research, is
the research on [inaudible]

01:23:19.930 --> 01:23:23.060
and I'm mentioning
here two works.

01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:27.140
We have been lucky in 1909
to receive the bequeath

01:23:27.140 --> 01:23:30.560
of the [inaudible]
1716 Stradi violins.

01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:33.460
Among six instrument
and eight bows coming

01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:38.040
from the Coveney family and I've
been working on this bequeath

01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:40.510
to -- on this group
of instruments

01:23:40.510 --> 01:23:44.100
to find the provenance and
to discover previous honor.

01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:48.400
And we were able to go back
through the early 19th century

01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:52.540
for this group of instruments,
which is not the total history

01:23:52.540 --> 01:23:56.500
of the instruments but still
it's a good step learning,

01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:58.440
going back in the past.

01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:00.820
I'm also mentioning
an upcoming monograph

01:24:00.820 --> 01:24:02.500
on the [inaudible] violins.

01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:09.400
So it's a 1724 Strad which was
bequest by [inaudible] to the

01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:13.090
to the museum in 1909 again.

01:24:13.090 --> 01:24:17.470
And a little book monograph
will be published and available

01:24:17.470 --> 01:24:18.910
for the moment in French only

01:24:18.910 --> 01:24:23.900
but I'm sure you will read
French on this violin.

01:24:25.250 --> 01:24:31.070
So now the 1708 davydov violin.

01:24:31.070 --> 01:24:38.180
This instrument is from a
conservation state point

01:24:38.180 --> 01:24:40.910
of view, in a very good
general conditions.

01:24:40.910 --> 01:24:42.950
There were no open cracks.

01:24:42.950 --> 01:24:46.060
No woodworm galleries
that were inside.

01:24:46.060 --> 01:24:50.640
So we performed institute
imaging techniques

01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:52.400
such as x-ray, radiograph,

01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:55.080
and [inaudible] examination
to check this.

01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:59.030
And it was in very
good general condition.

01:24:59.030 --> 01:25:03.090
We were then able to
consider to bring it back

01:25:03.090 --> 01:25:05.700
to playing condition because
this instrument had not played

01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:09.670
for at least thirty to forty
years in the collection.

01:25:09.670 --> 01:25:12.400
It has been kept
either in storage

01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:18.510
or behind the glass case only
and we were considering to,

01:25:18.510 --> 01:25:22.270
if there was a possibility,
to play at least one

01:25:22.270 --> 01:25:23.570
of these five violence.

01:25:23.570 --> 01:25:28.100
And the davydov seemed
the most suited for this.

01:25:28.100 --> 01:25:32.930
1708, it's considered to be
in the most esteemed period

01:25:32.930 --> 01:25:34.600
of Stradivari instrument.

01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:37.200
Some of them -- some
people named this period the

01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:38.670
golden period.

01:25:38.670 --> 01:25:42.810
But whatever it means, it
was a representative object

01:25:42.810 --> 01:25:45.560
with all the main part original.

01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:49.030
So the whole sound box as
well as the scroll coming

01:25:49.030 --> 01:25:51.690
from Antonio Stradivari work.

01:25:51.690 --> 01:25:55.360
And it was still a challenge

01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:57.750
to bring it back to
playing condition.

01:25:57.750 --> 01:26:01.310
It has not been played
for thirty to forty years.

01:26:01.310 --> 01:26:10.080
We do not have restoration --
a violin restorer in the staff,

01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:11.380
which would do the work.

01:26:11.380 --> 01:26:16.130
So we would have to contract the
work to a private conservator.

01:26:16.130 --> 01:26:18.470
So the challenge was
to bring the workshop

01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:22.010
of the conservator
inside our science lab.

01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:27.560
And it was already some -- there
was some thought given to that.

01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:30.730
And also, what should we do?

01:26:30.730 --> 01:26:33.850
What should we give
the people to hear

01:26:33.850 --> 01:26:35.710
and to see during this process?

01:26:35.710 --> 01:26:39.140
And it was the general approach.

01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:44.480
And we -- it took some time to
do it, to do this and I'm going

01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:49.680
to lead you to this little
journey and which will go

01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:53.780
to the use of science
objects as well.

01:26:53.780 --> 01:26:57.460
So the -- a few words
on the provenance

01:26:57.460 --> 01:27:02.930
of the davydov is not called
davydov the cellist who --

01:27:02.930 --> 01:27:04.230
and one of the cello

01:27:04.230 --> 01:27:07.950
of Stradivari is named
davydov after Karl Davydov.

01:27:07.950 --> 01:27:12.370
Davydov was and is a
common name in Russia.

01:27:12.370 --> 01:27:17.320
And this davydov is Vladimir
Alexandrovich Davydov

01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:20.580
and is not apparently
related, not apparent,

01:27:20.580 --> 01:27:22.470
to the Karl Davydov the cellist.

01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:23.770
It's another one.

01:27:23.770 --> 01:27:26.650
And I'm pointing
this because in books

01:27:26.650 --> 01:27:29.240
that are gathering the
history of many Strads,

01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:31.900
you often find the
confusion between the two.

01:27:31.900 --> 01:27:36.090
In especially, for
our 1708 violin.

01:27:36.090 --> 01:27:39.540
Vladimir Alexandrovich
Davydov, his mother was French.

01:27:39.540 --> 01:27:41.580
She escaped when she was two

01:27:41.580 --> 01:27:44.860
from Versailles during
the French Revolution.

01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:48.150
And this woman, she
eventually married a general

01:27:48.150 --> 01:27:52.750
of the Russian army
when she was older.

01:27:52.750 --> 01:27:55.710
And Vladimir Alexandrovich
Davydov was their son

01:27:55.710 --> 01:27:58.020
but he was still very
attached to France.

01:27:58.020 --> 01:28:02.260
And in the end of at the end of
his life he was being a diplomat

01:28:02.260 --> 01:28:06.060
or a special consular
for the Tsar.

01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:09.200
And he was often to France
for political reasons

01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:11.550
or diplomatic reasons.

01:28:11.550 --> 01:28:13.320
And we know that at least

01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:17.340
in 1880 he was already
owning this violin

01:28:17.340 --> 01:28:21.450
because the famous violin expert
and dealer named [inaudible]

01:28:21.450 --> 01:28:27.210
who was very active
in in Paris in 1880.

01:28:27.210 --> 01:28:30.760
Saw this instrument and
described it at the back of one

01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:32.970
of his own business card.

01:28:32.970 --> 01:28:37.450
So you see the photograph of
the back of the business card

01:28:37.450 --> 01:28:40.190
of [inaudible] and
this is now conserved

01:28:40.190 --> 01:28:45.870
in the archives national in
France where he described,

01:28:45.870 --> 01:28:50.380
even the state of conservation
there is a little bit

01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:54.540
of a songbird post patch,
etc. Very [inaudible] so,

01:28:54.540 --> 01:29:01.680
nice looking red varnish, bright
red varnish, well preserved,

01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:09.380
etc. And then so one year
before his death, Davydov went

01:29:09.380 --> 01:29:11.800
to see the head of the
Conservatoire at the time

01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:17.870
in Paris and told him, I will
give you by big quest my Strad.

01:29:17.870 --> 01:29:20.210
And he died, he passed
away one year after.

01:29:20.210 --> 01:29:25.630
And in 1887, the Museum of
the Conservatoire received

01:29:25.630 --> 01:29:29.390
for the first time
one Stradivari violin.

01:29:29.390 --> 01:29:30.850
So it was a big thing in France.

01:29:30.850 --> 01:29:35.170
It was in the newspapers,
etc. And the condition

01:29:35.170 --> 01:29:40.040
of the bequest was, this
instrument shall be played

01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:43.650
by the first violin
prize each year,

01:29:43.650 --> 01:29:45.530
you know, at the Conservatoire.

01:29:45.530 --> 01:29:49.600
The person awarded the first
prize violin could play this

01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:55.310
Strad for the concert after
the graduation ceremony.

01:29:55.310 --> 01:29:56.610
[Inaudible].

01:29:56.610 --> 01:30:04.760
And the first one who played
it in 1887 was Fritz Kreisler

01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:07.810
and he was 12 or 13 at the time.

01:30:07.810 --> 01:30:10.740
And so Fritz Kreisler
played it one night only

01:30:10.740 --> 01:30:12.430
for very tiny piece.

01:30:12.430 --> 01:30:18.640
So this is anecdotal but
I wanted to share that.

01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:23.890
The violin was later exhibited
for the 200th anniversary

01:30:23.890 --> 01:30:25.930
of the death of Stradivari

01:30:25.930 --> 01:30:30.630
at the exhibition
in Cremona in 1937.

01:30:30.630 --> 01:30:33.860
And after, it was lent
to several students

01:30:33.860 --> 01:30:36.110
for international competition.

01:30:36.110 --> 01:30:41.020
And including [inaudible]
in '81 and apparently,

01:30:41.020 --> 01:30:42.320
according to the records,

01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:45.120
it was the last loan
to a young musician.

01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:49.250
And after that the instrument
was not exactly maintaining

01:30:49.250 --> 01:30:54.650
playing condition and it was
just briefly played and tried

01:30:54.650 --> 01:30:56.060
by [inaudible], who is one

01:30:56.060 --> 01:30:59.480
of the Paris Conservatoire
violin teacher

01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:04.580
and also a musician, obviously,
very briefly in 2004 and 2007.

01:31:04.580 --> 01:31:07.240
But the setup of the
instrument was not perfect.

01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:12.440
The fingerboard was not
flat properly adjusted,

01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:15.550
the bridge as well had some
issue, etc. So there were issues

01:31:15.550 --> 01:31:17.690
in the setup at least.

01:31:17.690 --> 01:31:23.350
So we thought if we were to
play it again we should play it

01:31:23.350 --> 01:31:28.980
in a good setup state for
musicians to be comfortable with

01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:31.640
but still, according
to the [inaudible]

01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:38.720
and the noninvasiveness on
original part, etc. So we were

01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:42.440
to consider the heritage
values associated not only

01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:46.230
to the violin in general
but to each of it's parts.

01:31:46.230 --> 01:31:49.170
So even the fingerboard
if you think of that,

01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:53.700
the fingerboard dated
circa the 60's, 1960's,

01:31:53.700 --> 01:31:55.750
the current fingerboard
on the violin.

01:31:55.750 --> 01:32:00.430
And it was a work of
[inaudible] who was a prominent,

01:32:00.430 --> 01:32:04.460
maybe the best known are
the most famous violin maker

01:32:04.460 --> 01:32:06.360
and expert in the 20th century.

01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:08.810
So it's also part
of the heritage

01:32:08.810 --> 01:32:11.930
and should we keep,
it not keep it?

01:32:11.930 --> 01:32:16.860
So we decided to make 3d
laser scans measurement

01:32:16.860 --> 01:32:22.280
of the original, of the
before restoration state,

01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:24.170
before removing this part,

01:32:24.170 --> 01:32:27.190
the setup of [inaudible]
and keep it aside.

01:32:27.190 --> 01:32:29.130
So now it's kept in
the storage room.

01:32:29.130 --> 01:32:32.840
The 1960's set up
and put a new one

01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:37.080
because the previous one
was not able to play.

01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:42.550
This illustrates the fact that
a violin is a composite object

01:32:42.550 --> 01:32:45.870
which has evolved
in the centuries.

01:32:45.870 --> 01:32:51.960
So it's not -- even if this
violin dates 1708 on the label,

01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:55.850
even if its original part
are all from 1708 coming

01:32:55.850 --> 01:33:01.840
from Stradivari, still the setup
or the sun post or the pegs

01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:03.860
on the tail piece
are not original.

01:33:03.860 --> 01:33:06.730
But they are still part of the
material history of the object.

01:33:06.730 --> 01:33:08.800
And this were the
main concerns we had

01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:10.620
in the restoration process.

01:33:10.620 --> 01:33:16.300
So documentation of the
state before restoration,

01:33:16.300 --> 01:33:19.240
before treatment
was very important.

01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:23.000
Also we wanted to improve the
visual aspect of the instrument

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.110
because the instrument
was really dirty

01:33:25.110 --> 01:33:26.580
and we will go on that.

01:33:26.580 --> 01:33:29.060
The appearance was
not very proper

01:33:29.060 --> 01:33:33.520
for the good correct usability
of the wood of the vanishes,

01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:35.970
etc., especially
on the soundboard.

01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:47.300
We decided in the course
of this treatment to try

01:33:47.300 --> 01:33:51.140
to use scientific
imaging technique

01:33:51.140 --> 01:33:53.630
or measurement techniques
to follow the process

01:33:53.630 --> 01:33:54.950
of the restoration,

01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:59.820
so to properly document the
initial state before restoration

01:33:59.820 --> 01:34:01.290
and document the evolution

01:34:01.290 --> 01:34:04.440
of the instrument
during the treatment.

01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:09.360
So this will be the
focus of my talk now.

01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:16.170
I'll give you here a few images
of some aspects of the treatment

01:34:16.170 --> 01:34:18.920
and the restoration process.

01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:22.670
I want to mention the very
good collaboration we have had

01:34:22.670 --> 01:34:26.380
with the violin conservator
with name Balthazar [inaudible]

01:34:26.380 --> 01:34:31.510
and he has his workshop
named [inaudible] in Paris.

01:34:31.510 --> 01:34:36.580
He is the one who did
the conservation work.

01:34:36.580 --> 01:34:41.110
And you see part of him, these
are his hands and gloves.

01:34:41.110 --> 01:34:47.190
You see here he is re-gluing a
little crack on the soundboard.

01:34:47.190 --> 01:34:53.740
And so a few views of
some aspects of the work.

01:34:53.740 --> 01:34:59.420
Here we are on the scroll and
you may see that the original --

01:34:59.420 --> 01:35:03.910
these are the original holes for
the pegs so they have not been

01:35:03.910 --> 01:35:07.210
on this one bushed
and re-drilled

01:35:07.210 --> 01:35:08.880
which is frequently the case.

01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:12.380
So we are lucky to have
this original holes

01:35:12.380 --> 01:35:13.770
for the peg holes.

01:35:13.770 --> 01:35:18.270
So they were reinforced
by spiral bushings here.

01:35:18.270 --> 01:35:21.330
So it's during the operation,

01:35:21.330 --> 01:35:24.900
afterwards of obviously it
has been finished properly.

01:35:24.900 --> 01:35:29.440
You see the finished stage
in the middle under UV.

01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:35.770
And Balthazar also treated a
little crack here on this side,

01:35:35.770 --> 01:35:39.190
which was worrisome
if we were to think

01:35:39.190 --> 01:35:40.960
about the playing condition

01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:43.760
and the regular tuning
of the instrument.

01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:48.090
And it was very finely filled
with a piece of adjusted piece

01:35:48.090 --> 01:35:52.970
of wood and it's
really fine now.

01:35:54.070 --> 01:36:01.010
In his expert look
at the surfaces

01:36:01.010 --> 01:36:07.360
of the instrument led Balthazar
to present a kind of a map

01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:10.140
of the various layers
of materials

01:36:10.140 --> 01:36:12.210
that were on the soundboard.

01:36:12.210 --> 01:36:17.820
And so everything is -- we have
for reference a UV light image

01:36:17.820 --> 01:36:21.670
which is very frequent to
document the surface state

01:36:21.670 --> 01:36:24.600
of varnished instrument.

01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:31.890
And we were really worried
about this layer in this area.

01:36:31.890 --> 01:36:35.750
Very heavy, very rigid material.

01:36:35.750 --> 01:36:38.610
A little bit like concrete.

01:36:38.610 --> 01:36:43.230
A very thin layer of
mineral like material

01:36:43.230 --> 01:36:49.250
and not very adequate
red black patina

01:36:49.250 --> 01:36:52.900
which had some original
varnish under.

01:36:52.900 --> 01:37:00.620
So this were the main layers of
non-original materia we decided

01:37:00.620 --> 01:37:05.480
to to remove or to make
it lighter in order

01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:13.270
to improve the readability
of the underneath surface.

01:37:13.270 --> 01:37:19.180
So you see in the -- these are
two pictures there on the left.

01:37:19.180 --> 01:37:23.080
It's the original state
before any treatment.

01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:25.310
And this is during
the treatment.

01:37:25.310 --> 01:37:27.880
It's -- the treatment
is not finished

01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:29.950
so it's -- now it's better.

01:37:29.950 --> 01:37:32.070
It's more homogeneous even.

01:37:32.070 --> 01:37:33.510
It's during the treatment.

01:37:33.510 --> 01:37:36.960
But a lot of the patina on the
dirt, especially on the side

01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:41.780
of the fingerboard area
and in this central part

01:37:41.780 --> 01:37:47.970
of the soundboard were very
carefully, partially removed

01:37:47.970 --> 01:37:50.280
or almost totally removed.

01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:56.580
To track may be more objectively
the changes that occurred,

01:37:56.580 --> 01:38:02.840
we used system, a
multispectral imaging system

01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:06.450
that we've made built
in our lab.

01:38:06.450 --> 01:38:13.410
And it's a way to collect the
light reflected by the violin,

01:38:13.410 --> 01:38:18.740
using a system which is better
than a simple red, green,

01:38:18.740 --> 01:38:21.270
blue camera with three channels.

01:38:21.270 --> 01:38:26.400
We used a 14 channel color
camera, if you want to say.

01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:31.580
And this allows -- so you
see here this the 14 bandpass

01:38:31.580 --> 01:38:38.040
of the 14 filters and we collect
a series, a stack of 14 images,

01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:42.130
each of them corresponding
to a very narrow band

01:38:42.130 --> 01:38:47.580
in the visible regions
of the spectrum.

01:38:47.580 --> 01:38:53.580
And this process allows to
measure the reflected light,

01:38:53.580 --> 01:38:58.560
properly emitted
reflected by the object.

01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:00.380
It's not exactly a
color measurement.

01:39:00.380 --> 01:39:02.650
It's a measurement
of the reflectance.

01:39:02.650 --> 01:39:06.560
It's related but
it's not the same.

01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:10.730
And we did some comparison
in one of the band.

01:39:10.730 --> 01:39:15.880
So we picked this band in the
yellow area, in the yellow area

01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:19.090
of the visible spectrum
just to show it to you.

01:39:19.090 --> 01:39:22.040
But we could have
picked the other bands

01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:24.890
like in the spectral region.

01:39:24.890 --> 01:39:29.620
The idea is, was
to subtract the --

01:39:29.620 --> 01:39:32.180
to make a subtraction

01:39:32.180 --> 01:39:36.880
like between what is now
the instruments looking

01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:40.490
like minus what was the
instrument looking like before,

01:39:40.490 --> 01:39:44.640
using this multispectral
reflectance imaging.

01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:47.670
And it allows -- so
there is a false color --

01:39:47.670 --> 01:39:51.750
so there is a quite heavy
foil for me at least.

01:39:51.750 --> 01:39:53.930
My colleagues are very expert

01:39:53.930 --> 01:39:59.240
on that data processing
data correction,

01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:00.900
so that you can subtract.

01:40:00.900 --> 01:40:05.990
And you see the fourth color,
the pink area, shows to you

01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:11.960
where there is more reflected
light emitted after a treatment

01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:16.140
than before treatment
in the yellow region.

01:40:16.140 --> 01:40:22.500
And it's a way to very
properly document and map

01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:25.250
where material has been removed.

01:40:25.250 --> 01:40:27.000
Where color -- sorry.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:30.610
I said color and its color
scientists will not be happy

01:40:30.610 --> 01:40:32.730
if I say that.

01:40:32.730 --> 01:40:35.000
Where more light is reflected

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.150
from the instrument
in the yellow region.

01:40:37.150 --> 01:40:39.670
So basically where
it was very dark,

01:40:39.670 --> 01:40:42.610
now it's brighter in the yellow.

01:40:42.610 --> 01:40:44.290
I'm showing only the
yellow but we can do

01:40:44.290 --> 01:40:46.360
that for all the spectrum.

01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:51.550
And you see there was
obviously a gain in brightness

01:40:51.550 --> 01:40:55.000
in the central region but
also, I don't know if you see

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:59.570
that on the screen, but
this little badly restored

01:40:59.570 --> 01:41:02.420
in the past, maybe in
the 19th century crack,

01:41:02.420 --> 01:41:09.470
was a colored retouch that was
not well and we make it lighter.

01:41:09.470 --> 01:41:12.360
So now it's a brighter area.

01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:16.050
And dirt in this area
has been cleaned and here

01:41:16.050 --> 01:41:17.950
in this corner it has
been cleaned as well.

01:41:17.950 --> 01:41:19.250
So it's very precise.

01:41:19.250 --> 01:41:22.650
Each pixel corresponds
to an area smaller

01:41:22.650 --> 01:41:24.550
than one millimeter
on the object.

01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:27.720
So it's quite finely restored.

01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:31.530
Another tool we use
is more for geometry.

01:41:31.530 --> 01:41:34.810
The variations in
geometry of the soundbox

01:41:34.810 --> 01:41:37.700
and of the instruments
during the process.

01:41:37.700 --> 01:41:41.990
So this is not a CT scan,

01:41:41.990 --> 01:41:45.530
which is using x-rays,
it is a laser scan.

01:41:45.530 --> 01:41:49.090
So it gets you -- you obtain
only the outer surface

01:41:49.090 --> 01:41:51.880
of the object and
not the inside.

01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:57.050
But still, it's an arm that
you can bring to the museum

01:41:57.050 --> 01:42:01.480
and you don't have to move
the instrument to the CT scan.

01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:06.040
So it's very easy and
there's a very good resolution

01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:09.520
and you get directly on the
computer why you acquire --

01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:14.730
you swipe the laser
line on the object

01:42:14.730 --> 01:42:17.360
and you collect a 3D surface.

01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:20.110
Then, like in the
multispectral imaging,

01:42:20.110 --> 01:42:25.070
you can make substraction like
before and after comparison.

01:42:25.070 --> 01:42:30.520
So this image is a subtraction
image of what is the difference

01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:36.200
between when you -- when the
sound post is in position

01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:38.240
and when the sound
post is not in position

01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:41.880
because at some point we
removed the old song post

01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:43.180
in the instrument.

01:42:43.180 --> 01:42:46.330
And you see that when
you remove -- sorry.

01:42:46.330 --> 01:42:50.600
When you place the sound post,

01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:54.840
the area of the soundboard
is getting higher obviously.

01:42:54.840 --> 01:42:58.290
It's kind of obvious for
violin makers who are here.

01:42:58.290 --> 01:43:02.460
But there are movements
of the soundboard.

01:43:02.460 --> 01:43:05.880
And you see this, usually
the soundboard is here,

01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:08.030
touching here, the soundboard.

01:43:08.030 --> 01:43:10.060
But the consequences
and the evolution

01:43:10.060 --> 01:43:12.760
of the hate also
come up to here.

01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:14.840
You see it's bluer here.

01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:18.090
And it means that the
whole structure is moving

01:43:18.090 --> 01:43:19.700
in a complex way.

01:43:19.700 --> 01:43:23.680
So in the idea of the
risk assessment we take

01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:26.090
when we make a modification
of the instrument

01:43:26.090 --> 01:43:28.680
when we setup even a song post,

01:43:28.680 --> 01:43:31.440
this kind of tools
could be very useful.

01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:36.940
On a -- at a larger scale,
when we make this substraction

01:43:36.940 --> 01:43:41.870
after treatment minus
before treatment,

01:43:41.870 --> 01:43:46.190
we see a general
modification of the violins

01:43:46.190 --> 01:43:50.160
where when you string the --
when you tune the instrument

01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:55.230
when it's strung, obviously
the soundboards go lower

01:43:55.230 --> 01:43:57.590
because of the pressure
of the bridge.

01:43:57.590 --> 01:43:59.440
And it's -- what is the scale?

01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:03.540
It's about one millimeter
lower deflection of this area,

01:44:03.540 --> 01:44:06.340
which is not -- it's
a lot when you think

01:44:06.340 --> 01:44:10.750
that the soundboard is two
and a half millimeter thick.

01:44:10.750 --> 01:44:16.250
And interestingly also we see
that come relatively in terms

01:44:16.250 --> 01:44:21.790
of relative position, the scroll
I mean, [inaudible] is going

01:44:21.790 --> 01:44:24.850
up when you pull the strings.

01:44:24.850 --> 01:44:28.680
And this kind of
modifications help also

01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:31.140
and it gives you a
range of the scale

01:44:31.140 --> 01:44:33.800
and the magnitude
of these changes.

01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:36.790
And it's like the movement --

01:44:36.790 --> 01:44:40.540
or relative movement of the
scroll is one millimeter also,

01:44:40.540 --> 01:44:43.940
approximately in
the other direction.

01:44:43.940 --> 01:44:46.560
So the soundboard is
going one millimeter down,

01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:50.910
roughly speaking, and the scroll
is going one millimeter up.

01:44:50.910 --> 01:44:55.760
So if you want to treat and we
are planning to use this kind

01:44:55.760 --> 01:45:02.980
of 3D methodological tools to
follow, to monitor instrument

01:45:02.980 --> 01:45:04.840
that are kept in condition.

01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:11.450
It might be a way to follow
and to detect early enough

01:45:11.450 --> 01:45:13.410
if the structure
is moving too much.

01:45:13.410 --> 01:45:17.660
It's changing too much.

01:45:17.660 --> 01:45:22.650
Third, I'm showing you another
technique, quite experimental

01:45:22.650 --> 01:45:27.190
that has been developed by
our colleagues in [inaudible]

01:45:27.190 --> 01:45:30.710
which is in Paris University.

01:45:30.710 --> 01:45:34.630
And this tool is part
of the acoustics field

01:45:34.630 --> 01:45:37.550
and the vibrations field.

01:45:37.550 --> 01:45:42.380
You imagine you see
on the top a side view

01:45:42.380 --> 01:45:44.480
of an array of microphones.

01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:50.510
These are 128 microphone in
an array, in a grid matrix.

01:45:50.510 --> 01:45:55.480
And they record sound
all at the same time.

01:45:55.480 --> 01:45:57.580
They are synchronized.

01:45:57.580 --> 01:46:02.970
So you collect on 128
channels simultaneously.

01:46:02.970 --> 01:46:07.280
The acoustic answer
and the microphone.

01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:09.450
So we don't play
the violin here.

01:46:09.450 --> 01:46:12.110
We will not bow on
the instrument.

01:46:12.110 --> 01:46:16.980
It's a tool to again look at
the way the soundboard vibrates

01:46:16.980 --> 01:46:19.130
and how the instrument vibrates.

01:46:19.130 --> 01:46:27.700
The experiment, you need to make
a little impact with a triggered

01:46:27.700 --> 01:46:30.430
by computer -- a hammer
triggered by computer.

01:46:30.430 --> 01:46:33.210
So you know where --
when it's triggered

01:46:33.210 --> 01:46:35.510
and you synchronize
the sound collection

01:46:35.510 --> 01:46:38.320
of the 128 microscope.

01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:42.840
And this is giving you what
is called the near field

01:46:42.840 --> 01:46:44.690
acoustic holography.

01:46:44.690 --> 01:46:45.990
So it's giving you data

01:46:45.990 --> 01:46:49.440
of the air pressure
modification of the mics.

01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:52.170
But it tells you how
the soundboard vibrates.

01:46:52.170 --> 01:46:56.140
And if there is a crack in
the soundboard, you will see

01:46:56.140 --> 01:47:00.210
in the answer of the
machine of the technique.

01:47:00.210 --> 01:47:06.520
So this is a very important
mechanical monitoring tool.

01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:09.890
And here I'm showing
the radiated pressure,

01:47:09.890 --> 01:47:11.190
some pressure.

01:47:11.190 --> 01:47:16.140
It's an average on
the 128 microphones.

01:47:16.140 --> 01:47:22.670
And the x-axis is the frequency
in hertz and you have modes

01:47:22.670 --> 01:47:25.570
of vibration of the
soundboard which are appearing

01:47:25.570 --> 01:47:28.600
as peaks in the spectrum.

01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:32.340
I'm not a specialist
of this field

01:47:32.340 --> 01:47:35.880
with my colleagues [inaudible]
our colleagues at [inaudible]

01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:40.630
who are the experts on that.

01:47:40.630 --> 01:47:46.020
But we evidence quite important
and noticeable differences

01:47:46.020 --> 01:47:51.130
in the vibration mode between
the before the treatment

01:47:51.130 --> 01:47:52.910
and after the treatment.

01:47:52.910 --> 01:47:56.860
So this is currently
investigated

01:47:56.860 --> 01:48:01.200
to attribute properly the
changes to this operation

01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:03.980
in the treatment of that
operation in the treatment.

01:48:03.980 --> 01:48:09.240
It could be the re-gluing of
the strengthening of the gluing

01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:11.580
of the soundboard in
one part on the ribs.

01:48:11.580 --> 01:48:12.880
It could be something else.

01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:14.830
It could be the song
post position,

01:48:14.830 --> 01:48:18.880
etc. It's under investigation
but I wanted to share that tool

01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:21.520
with you which is
totally non-invasive.

01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:26.550
The hammer is very, very
light and tiny hammer and just

01:48:26.550 --> 01:48:29.650
to allow the soundbox
to vibrate.

01:48:31.070 --> 01:48:35.570
So we comes towards
the end of my talk.

01:48:35.570 --> 01:48:37.290
I hope I'm not too, too long.

01:48:37.290 --> 01:48:41.200
And these three techniques
use light.

01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:46.950
The reflectance in the
visible spectrum use a laser

01:48:46.950 --> 01:48:52.050
to measure geometrical
modification and use vibration

01:48:52.050 --> 01:48:59.070
in air, so sound, sound waves,
to analyze and to monitor

01:48:59.070 --> 01:49:02.980
without contact the
changes on one instrument.

01:49:02.980 --> 01:49:09.950
And it's to us we are quite
satisfied by these tools.

01:49:09.950 --> 01:49:13.810
We have been experimenting
during this conservation process

01:49:13.810 --> 01:49:18.190
and we hope to improve
and go on with the use

01:49:18.190 --> 01:49:23.540
of this non-invasive tool, I
repeat, to follow the treatment.

01:49:23.540 --> 01:49:28.990
So hopefully, finally the
instrument has been restored

01:49:28.990 --> 01:49:30.300
and is in playing condition.

01:49:30.300 --> 01:49:34.390
So what what should
we do with that?

01:49:34.390 --> 01:49:39.130
I need to try to
show this to you.

01:49:40.310 --> 01:49:47.870
Up. A little bit.

01:49:47.870 --> 01:49:53.120
So this a recording that has
been performed by [inaudible]

01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:57.510
in the auditorium
of the [inaudible]

01:49:57.510 --> 01:50:58.110
[ Music ]

01:50:58.110 --> 01:51:00.380
This instrument is now
in playing condition.

01:51:00.380 --> 01:51:02.990
We are very happy with that.

01:51:02.990 --> 01:51:08.870
The visitors and the audience
is very pleased with that.

01:51:08.870 --> 01:51:12.270
And now we hope and we
are currently thinking

01:51:12.270 --> 01:51:14.910
of further programs
with this instruments.

01:51:14.910 --> 01:51:19.380
And it can be CD's, CD
recordings performed

01:51:19.380 --> 01:51:24.380
at the [inaudible] and
also concerts programming

01:51:24.380 --> 01:51:27.670
in the same venue, same hole.

01:51:27.670 --> 01:51:31.560
So we are now considering
which project will occur

01:51:31.560 --> 01:51:34.840
after this short
video you may find

01:51:34.840 --> 01:51:38.230
on the YouTube channel
of the [inaudible].

01:51:38.230 --> 01:51:47.280
I am -- I would like to
thanks a lot of colleagues

01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:50.250
and the colleagues
in the science

01:51:50.250 --> 01:51:53.510
in the research team
of the [inaudible].

01:51:53.510 --> 01:51:59.780
So [inaudible], she is the
head of the lab and also

01:51:59.780 --> 01:52:03.280
for the video production
[inaudible].

01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:06.050
And outside of the
team of the [inaudible]

01:52:06.050 --> 01:52:09.700
but it's showing the
interdisciplinary collaborations

01:52:09.700 --> 01:52:14.090
we have with other scientists
Belthazor [inaudible] I

01:52:14.090 --> 01:52:20.020
mentioned was the
conservator on this violin.

01:52:20.020 --> 01:52:21.680
[Inaudible] who did the --

01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:25.080
perform the reflectance
multispectral imaging with me

01:52:25.080 --> 01:52:26.900
and treated the data

01:52:26.900 --> 01:52:30.160
on multispectral
imaging with [inaudible].

01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:34.010
[Inaudible] and Francois Olivier

01:52:34.010 --> 01:52:37.830
for the near field
acoustic holography.

01:52:37.830 --> 01:52:41.180
[Inaudible] from the
company [inaudible]

01:52:41.180 --> 01:52:45.370
for the 3D laser scans
and Christian [inaudible]

01:52:45.370 --> 01:52:47.740
for the wood purfling analysis.

01:52:47.740 --> 01:52:52.750
And I thank you for
your attention.

01:52:52.750 --> 01:52:55.050
Thank you.

01:53:02.010 --> 01:53:03.310
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: [Inaudible].

01:53:03.310 --> 01:53:08.400
So we will now take
questions from the audience

01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:10.230
for any of the speakers.

01:53:10.230 --> 01:53:16.940
We have around 50 people online
listening in so we will ask --

01:53:16.940 --> 01:53:20.460
I will try and interpret the
question and we'll repeat

01:53:20.460 --> 01:53:23.090
that so that our
off-site audience can hear

01:53:23.090 --> 01:53:24.390
their question.

01:53:24.390 --> 01:53:26.860
And answer and we
will also check to see

01:53:26.860 --> 01:53:29.760
if there's any questions
from outside as well.

01:53:29.760 --> 01:53:32.390
So the floor belongs to you all.

01:53:32.390 --> 01:53:35.880
I open up.

01:53:35.880 --> 01:53:38.950
But I must admit, it's hard to
think after that last video.

01:53:46.200 --> 01:53:47.500
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker: I have
a question for Jean-Philippe.

01:53:47.500 --> 01:53:48.800
Was there any documentation --

01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:55.590
you have very well described
how you document what you did

01:53:55.590 --> 01:54:01.870
from the moment you started
to do a preservation,

01:54:01.870 --> 01:54:04.270
restoration of the instrument.

01:54:04.270 --> 01:54:12.400
Is there a lot of record
of, on what was happening

01:54:12.400 --> 01:54:17.630
to the instrument from the
time it was produced originally

01:54:17.630 --> 01:54:19.670
until you started to work on it?

01:54:19.670 --> 01:54:22.920
So you can see if what
you do is restoring it

01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:24.590
to its original acoustic.

01:54:24.590 --> 01:54:26.690
&gt;&gt; Fenella France:
So the question was,

01:54:26.690 --> 01:54:32.220
was the documentation
prior to the treatment

01:54:32.220 --> 01:54:36.610
and conservation work
that helps understand more

01:54:36.610 --> 01:54:43.070
about what had happened
to the instrument.

01:54:43.070 --> 01:54:44.370
&gt;&gt; Jean-Philippe Echard:
We have no record archives

01:54:44.370 --> 01:54:48.030
of previous treatments
on the instruments.

01:54:48.030 --> 01:54:50.510
Especially -- the
only documents --

01:54:50.510 --> 01:54:55.120
the only document is
the instrument itself.

01:54:55.120 --> 01:54:59.410
So unfortunately, no document
was kept for the modifications.

01:54:59.410 --> 01:55:01.490
In some other instances we --

01:55:01.490 --> 01:55:03.710
since we keep also
archives in our collection

01:55:03.710 --> 01:55:05.680
from the workshop
funded by Loophole,

01:55:05.680 --> 01:55:09.150
a very important workshop in
the 19th century in Paris.

01:55:09.150 --> 01:55:12.660
We can't find -- we can find
such records but in the case

01:55:12.660 --> 01:55:16.030
of the davydov known under
mentioning the scroll, the head,

01:55:16.030 --> 01:55:21.180
the peg box, we have been
able to evidence that they are

01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:24.250
onto some -- I don't
know in English

01:55:24.250 --> 01:55:29.630
but the neck has been
changed three times.

01:55:29.630 --> 01:55:31.600
You know, the neck is
usually not original

01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:34.090
on violins of this period.

01:55:34.090 --> 01:55:39.600
And we have seen two different
traces of changing neck work

01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:43.570
in the -- when you look at
the peg box from the front.

01:55:43.570 --> 01:55:51.060
So this is an indication
of the things that happen

01:55:51.060 --> 01:55:54.300
of the material history
of the works

01:55:54.300 --> 01:56:02.320
of previous repair
orchestra of the instrument.

01:56:02.320 --> 01:56:07.990
But for -- so the second
half of your question was,

01:56:07.990 --> 01:56:11.430
did we bring back the instrument
to the original state.

01:56:11.430 --> 01:56:13.140
If I'm not wrong

01:56:13.140 --> 01:56:14.440
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker: Yeah.

01:56:14.440 --> 01:56:15.740
I wrote it on the card.

01:56:15.740 --> 01:56:22.660
It says, at the moment this
instrument has [inaudible].

01:56:22.660 --> 01:56:23.960
It said [inaudible].

01:56:23.960 --> 01:56:25.260
&gt;&gt; Jean-Philippe
Echard: [Inaudible].

01:56:25.260 --> 01:56:29.400
In 1880 [inaudible] reports
that there is a repair

01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:32.180
in the sound post area.

01:56:32.180 --> 01:56:36.280
So it's a way to
date such a repair.

01:56:36.280 --> 01:56:42.300
So since [inaudible] saw it this
repair was there before 1880.

01:56:42.300 --> 01:56:46.460
This kind of relative dating
we have to deal with a lot

01:56:46.460 --> 01:56:50.990
because it's very rare
we have archives records

01:56:50.990 --> 01:56:53.970
of all the treatments.

01:56:59.190 --> 01:57:00.980
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker: I
think that's [inaudible].

01:57:00.980 --> 01:57:02.280
The acoustic -- sorry.

01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:05.070
The acoustic technique
was very cool.

01:57:05.070 --> 01:57:09.090
And you got, you know,
you got a spectrum

01:57:09.090 --> 01:57:13.070
that showed a difference that --

01:57:13.070 --> 01:57:17.390
are you subjectively
interpreting what you want it

01:57:17.390 --> 01:57:19.880
to sound like, or what's
better or worse there?

01:57:19.880 --> 01:57:22.770
I mean, how do you --

01:57:22.770 --> 01:57:24.790
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: So the
question was the interpretation

01:57:24.790 --> 01:57:27.090
of the acoustical analysis.

01:57:30.060 --> 01:57:31.770
&gt;&gt; Jean-Philippe
Echard: And thank.

01:57:31.770 --> 01:57:36.890
And this tool is
using sound waves.

01:57:36.890 --> 01:57:42.950
The sound records -- so sound is
a variation of pressure of air

01:57:42.950 --> 01:57:46.530
at microphone or at the ear.

01:57:46.530 --> 01:57:50.870
And it uses acoustic or sounds.

01:57:50.870 --> 01:57:55.360
But the aim of it is
not to record the sound

01:57:55.360 --> 01:57:58.300
or to tune -- to
adjust the sound.

01:57:58.300 --> 01:58:04.950
It is to monitor or record
the mechanical behavior.

01:58:04.950 --> 01:58:10.160
So the way the plate vibrates
and it's by breaking modes.

01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:12.510
So it's mostly vibration
if I'm correct.

01:58:12.510 --> 01:58:16.530
I'm not the expert, I
told you, in this field.

01:58:16.530 --> 01:58:21.790
So the idea is to
see the changes

01:58:21.790 --> 01:58:24.970
in the mechanical
structure of the instrument

01:58:24.970 --> 01:58:29.690
and it has certainly
effects on the sound,

01:58:29.690 --> 01:58:31.170
the mechanical structure.

01:58:31.170 --> 01:58:32.570
How it vibrate.

01:58:32.570 --> 01:58:38.360
But it's not very related
in an obvious manner.

01:58:38.360 --> 01:58:42.590
I'm -- we cannot tell from these
spectral measurements how it

01:58:42.590 --> 01:58:43.890
affect the sound.

01:58:43.890 --> 01:58:45.970
It's more complex than this.

01:58:45.970 --> 01:58:47.770
I have to say that the violin

01:58:47.770 --> 01:58:53.260
as an vibrating structure
is a very complex structure

01:58:53.260 --> 01:58:54.900
to model properly.

01:58:54.900 --> 01:58:57.920
And every violin is
slightly different,

01:58:57.920 --> 01:59:01.170
even modern violins
are slightly different.

01:59:01.170 --> 01:59:05.750
And it's very difficult to model
properly the influence of each

01:59:05.750 --> 01:59:09.450
of the parameter, especially
when we go to the sound.

01:59:13.070 --> 01:59:15.530
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker: But
you would use the acoustical

01:59:15.530 --> 01:59:17.770
information to help
set up the instrument.

01:59:17.770 --> 01:59:20.070
Is that correct?

01:59:23.570 --> 01:59:24.870
&gt;&gt; Jean-Philippe Echard: We --

01:59:24.870 --> 01:59:28.350
for the moment we use it to
monitor the changes only.

01:59:28.350 --> 01:59:35.030
We didn't go far
enough until now to --

01:59:35.030 --> 01:59:39.060
it will need a dedicated
long term --

01:59:39.060 --> 01:59:43.080
like a one-year study or
postdoc or something like that,

01:59:43.080 --> 01:59:47.850
to study exactly the
effect of this parameter,

01:59:47.850 --> 01:59:52.090
let's say the song post
position and length

01:59:52.090 --> 01:59:54.640
on the changes of the structure.

01:59:54.640 --> 01:59:58.040
It would need that to
understand exactly what we do.

01:59:58.040 --> 02:00:02.260
And I showed you only an
other -- a simple spectrum,

02:00:02.260 --> 02:00:05.930
if I may say, which is an
average spectrum of related

02:00:05.930 --> 02:00:09.490
to the vibration
of the instrument.

02:00:09.490 --> 02:00:12.950
But we would be also
available --

02:00:12.950 --> 02:00:16.900
it would be also
possible to make maps.

02:00:16.900 --> 02:00:22.880
So you would see the vibration
modes on how the plates deform

02:00:22.880 --> 02:00:24.690
and vibrate at certain
frequency.

02:00:24.690 --> 02:00:27.770
Which would help also but
this is some extra work,

02:00:27.770 --> 02:00:31.770
a lot of computer
time and treatment.

02:00:40.060 --> 02:00:44.100
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:
What processed was used

02:00:44.100 --> 02:00:45.400
to remove the old image patina?

02:00:45.400 --> 02:00:46.700
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: Question
was, what process was used

02:00:46.700 --> 02:00:49.000
to remove the existing patina.

02:00:54.090 --> 02:00:57.980
&gt;&gt; Jean-Philippe Echard: A
dedicated mixture of solvents

02:00:57.980 --> 02:01:02.520
of three types, which were --

02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:07.040
which are widely used
in painting conservation

02:01:07.040 --> 02:01:09.490
and furniture conservation.

02:01:09.490 --> 02:01:13.970
And I will not go into the
theoretical aspect of this

02:01:13.970 --> 02:01:20.130
but it's filled like the
effect, the ways to use solvent

02:01:20.130 --> 02:01:25.840
to clean surfaces is a
widely inspired from decades,

02:01:25.840 --> 02:01:31.120
if not one century of solvent
studies to clean paintings.

02:01:31.120 --> 02:01:35.700
So in this case I
will not say --

02:01:35.700 --> 02:01:38.370
I mean, I don't have in mind
exactly the three solvents

02:01:38.370 --> 02:01:42.430
that were mixed in
various ratios to adapt

02:01:42.430 --> 02:01:45.060
to the reactivity
of the surface.

02:01:45.060 --> 02:01:46.400
We want the material --

02:01:46.400 --> 02:01:50.840
we wanted to remove but this
was done with this solvent

02:01:50.840 --> 02:01:55.700
which were in contact on very
small areas using a swab --

02:01:55.700 --> 02:01:59.250
a swab-- cotton swab
with the solvent

02:01:59.250 --> 02:02:05.470
or tiny droplets using a micro
syringe to bring the solvent

02:02:05.470 --> 02:02:08.910
and the contact time of the
solvent was controlled as well.

02:02:08.910 --> 02:02:12.280
And then the material removed.

02:02:12.280 --> 02:02:18.880
And all this was done under the
binocular microscope to control

02:02:18.880 --> 02:02:21.470
at best with visual the thing.

02:02:21.470 --> 02:02:30.140
In some tiny areas where the
material would be not responding

02:02:30.140 --> 02:02:32.910
perfectly to the
solvent mixture,

02:02:32.910 --> 02:02:36.700
we would use a mechanical
abrasion with a micro scalpel

02:02:36.700 --> 02:02:40.510
as well under binocular control.

02:02:40.510 --> 02:02:41.810
How do you call that?

02:02:41.810 --> 02:02:43.500
A stereo microscope
is the proper one.

02:02:43.500 --> 02:02:45.800
I'm sorry about that.

02:02:51.310 --> 02:02:54.310
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:
Can I ask the [inaudible]

02:02:54.310 --> 02:03:09.750
about how any storage
differences

02:03:09.750 --> 02:03:13.140
or future conservation
recommendations would be

02:03:13.140 --> 02:03:16.440
for these glasses and any
other glass objects compared

02:03:16.440 --> 02:03:17.780
to any others?

02:03:17.780 --> 02:03:19.080
&gt;&gt; Fenella France:
So the question was

02:03:19.080 --> 02:03:22.070
about the storage
recommendations going forward.

02:03:22.070 --> 02:03:23.370
Carol Lynn perhaps.

02:03:23.370 --> 02:03:24.980
I know this is close
conservation.

02:03:24.980 --> 02:03:26.280
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward
Bamford: Right.

02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:28.110
We worked with the
conservation part of --

02:03:28.110 --> 02:03:29.410
under the preservation
directorate.

02:03:29.410 --> 02:03:30.710
And we have created
a modified cabinet,

02:03:30.710 --> 02:03:32.310
a storage cabinet
that's gasketed.

02:03:32.310 --> 02:03:35.280
And it has a glass
front so I can look in

02:03:35.280 --> 02:03:40.270
and just eyeball things and
not pull out the drawer.

02:03:40.270 --> 02:03:44.590
And it's -- the drawers
inside are perforated

02:03:44.590 --> 02:03:46.010
to allow for air flow.

02:03:46.010 --> 02:03:50.020
There are two fans in there that
also help circulate the air.

02:03:50.020 --> 02:03:52.680
Then the flutes themselves,
so that's the cabinet

02:03:52.680 --> 02:03:58.680
but within each flute we had
special cases made for --

02:03:58.680 --> 02:04:02.220
or boxes made for
each individual flute,

02:04:02.220 --> 02:04:08.240
that has like a micro filament
of like a cloth that sort

02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:10.100
of suspends the flute.

02:04:10.100 --> 02:04:14.340
And the ends of the
box are exposed or open

02:04:14.340 --> 02:04:17.720
to allows much air
circulation as we can.

02:04:17.720 --> 02:04:22.130
And then there is
silica gel at the bottom,

02:04:22.130 --> 02:04:24.820
also at a controlled
set point --

02:04:24.820 --> 02:04:26.550
or a relative set
point that we have.

02:04:26.550 --> 02:04:28.940
So we actually have
started that.

02:04:28.940 --> 02:04:31.540
We tested it for
quite a few months

02:04:31.540 --> 02:04:35.010
and we've put the
flutes in this cabinet.

02:04:35.010 --> 02:04:37.100
And we continue to monitor.

02:04:37.100 --> 02:04:41.000
One of our monitor people
back there, Ben is here

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.720
and it's been fantastic
to work with them

02:04:43.720 --> 02:04:45.510
to study the temperature
and humidity

02:04:45.510 --> 02:04:49.200
that we're keeping in there.

02:04:49.200 --> 02:04:53.930
&gt;&gt; Lynn Brostoff: I
would just like to add

02:04:53.930 --> 02:04:56.210
that I think it's -- oh, yeah.

02:04:56.210 --> 02:04:58.940
It's well known that when you
have glass that's unstable,

02:04:58.940 --> 02:05:01.070
it's very important to keep --

02:05:01.070 --> 02:05:04.900
to put things in an
environment that's very steady

02:05:04.900 --> 02:05:06.560
so it's not cycling anymore.

02:05:06.560 --> 02:05:10.670
And if you have hydrated
glass, it's quite dangerous

02:05:10.670 --> 02:05:13.130
to lower the humidity too much.

02:05:13.130 --> 02:05:16.810
So I don't remember the
recommended relative humidity

02:05:16.810 --> 02:05:21.530
you have that you're
maintaining now.

02:05:21.530 --> 02:05:24.320
But I do know, you know,
it's just kind of a warning

02:05:24.320 --> 02:05:27.640
because metals are kept
relatively dry to --

02:05:27.640 --> 02:05:29.860
so that they don't
corrode but the --

02:05:29.860 --> 02:05:33.710
if the glass is already
hydrated, it could actually --

02:05:33.710 --> 02:05:35.100
could be in an equilibrium

02:05:35.100 --> 02:05:37.540
where the water is actually
holding together a certain

02:05:37.540 --> 02:05:40.180
amount and could just
literally fall apart.

02:05:40.180 --> 02:05:43.500
So it would be quite
dangerous to dry out glass.

02:05:43.500 --> 02:05:48.500
And we did look at historical
records of the relative humidity

02:05:48.500 --> 02:05:51.760
and temperature in the
previous vault setting.

02:05:51.760 --> 02:05:53.600
And we did see a certain amount

02:05:53.600 --> 02:05:56.820
of cycling especially,
that was seasonal.

02:05:56.820 --> 02:06:01.330
So we've gone to great
effort to eliminate that kind

02:06:01.330 --> 02:06:05.170
of variation in the atmosphere.

02:06:05.170 --> 02:06:07.450
I mean, even just opening
the drawers and taking them

02:06:07.450 --> 02:06:12.280
from the drawer into the room
for a researcher caused a spike.

02:06:12.280 --> 02:06:15.670
So we went to great
lengths to eliminate that.

02:06:15.670 --> 02:06:21.190
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:
What about my question?

02:06:21.190 --> 02:06:22.490
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:
She answered your question.

02:06:22.490 --> 02:06:23.790
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:

02:06:23.790 --> 02:06:25.090
[Inaudible] question
about boots.

02:06:25.090 --> 02:06:29.090
Is there a characteristic
fluorescence for potash flutes?

02:06:29.090 --> 02:06:30.460
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: The
question was whether these is a

02:06:30.460 --> 02:06:33.590
characteristic fluorescence
for potash flutes.

02:06:33.590 --> 02:06:34.890
&gt;&gt; Lynn Brostoff: Yeah.

02:06:34.890 --> 02:06:38.120
I think the literature
is a little bit confusing

02:06:38.120 --> 02:06:41.950
about fluorescence of glass
and a lot of people felt

02:06:41.950 --> 02:06:44.570
that it was just unpredictable.

02:06:44.570 --> 02:06:49.000
But we are fortunate that
[inaudible] always put

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:53.140
that little dash
of manganese in.

02:06:53.140 --> 02:06:57.090
And because of that
manganese we can tell

02:06:57.090 --> 02:06:59.970
that it does have a
characteristic fluorescence

02:06:59.970 --> 02:07:04.470
which was that yellowy green
color that Stephanie showed.

02:07:04.470 --> 02:07:08.910
And in fact, it's very
important in UV examination

02:07:08.910 --> 02:07:13.230
to use two wavelengths so you
can use long and short UV.

02:07:13.230 --> 02:07:16.740
And the fluorescence is
a little bit different.

02:07:16.740 --> 02:07:20.220
And we are now batting 100%

02:07:20.220 --> 02:07:23.660
in predicting whether we
have a high leaded glass

02:07:23.660 --> 02:07:27.540
or a potash glass for
[inaudible] flutes

02:07:27.540 --> 02:07:30.150
because remember,
they're a formulation.

02:07:30.150 --> 02:07:33.420
So that's not just
potassium and silicon,

02:07:33.420 --> 02:07:34.720
there's a lot of other things.

02:07:34.720 --> 02:07:37.060
Or it's not just
lead in silicon.

02:07:37.060 --> 02:07:41.540
And yes, it's very
characteristically

02:07:41.540 --> 02:07:43.800
that yellowy green color.

02:07:43.800 --> 02:07:47.040
And the leaded ones are
also known in shortwave

02:07:47.040 --> 02:07:49.890
to be what people call icy blue.

02:07:49.890 --> 02:07:53.450
And the combination of
that pink and the icy blue

02:07:53.450 --> 02:07:55.810
and the two wavelengths
is very definitive

02:07:55.810 --> 02:07:58.710
for those highlighted glasses.

02:07:58.710 --> 02:08:01.130
So as I said, we've been
using this technique

02:08:01.130 --> 02:08:05.470
and we're literally 100%
spot on in predicting

02:08:05.470 --> 02:08:07.970
which type of glass it is.

02:08:11.080 --> 02:08:13.320
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: So I think
we'll just wrap up the questions

02:08:13.320 --> 02:08:16.900
for now and you can catch some
of the speakers afterwards.

02:08:16.900 --> 02:08:19.590
I think you'll join me in saying

02:08:19.590 --> 02:08:22.410
that was a fantastic
group of presentations.

02:08:22.410 --> 02:08:25.860
And I love the fact that
we saw so much influence

02:08:25.860 --> 02:08:28.690
and importance placed
on the collaboration,

02:08:28.690 --> 02:08:31.510
and the multidisciplinary
approach, and just the need

02:08:31.510 --> 02:08:33.400
because we all have
slightly different expertises

02:08:33.400 --> 02:08:34.760
and we all need to
work together.

02:08:34.760 --> 02:08:36.170
And pull those -- the fact

02:08:36.170 --> 02:08:38.720
that we're all doing
sometimes similar techniques,

02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:40.020
sometimes different.

02:08:40.020 --> 02:08:43.340
And new replications of those,
focusing on the non-invasive.

02:08:43.340 --> 02:08:46.790
And also the educational
component and the dissemination

02:08:46.790 --> 02:08:48.850
of research because
if we're going to use

02:08:48.850 --> 02:08:51.800
or protect our cultural heritage
then we need to make sure

02:08:51.800 --> 02:08:54.290
that we're sharing
this information.

02:08:54.290 --> 02:08:55.610
So I just want to mention

02:08:55.610 --> 02:08:58.950
that the next tops presentation
is preservation week

02:08:58.950 --> 02:09:00.530
on April 23rd.

02:09:00.530 --> 02:09:03.840
There'll be a number of events,
including a lunchtime lecture

02:09:03.840 --> 02:09:05.670
and this is all on the website.

02:09:05.670 --> 02:09:08.560
But also there will
be preservation tours

02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:10.940
so have a look at the website.

02:09:10.940 --> 02:09:14.500
But once again, please -- this
will bring to an end this part

02:09:14.500 --> 02:09:17.730
of the afternoon and please
join me in thanking all

02:09:17.730 --> 02:09:20.030
of our speakers very much.

02:09:28.040 --> 02:09:31.490
This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.

02:09:31.490 --> 02:09:32.970
