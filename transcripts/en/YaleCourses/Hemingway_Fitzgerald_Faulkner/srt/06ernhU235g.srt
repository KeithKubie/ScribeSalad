1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,570
Oh, last time we talk about the, uh,

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,770
the kind of odd presence of
race in the great Gatsby. Um,

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,800
even though there's no African
American character in great Gatsby,

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,190
um, there's a kind of undercurrent
of illusions to raise, um,

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:22,310
especially in that seemingly with two
of his scenes when I'm naked and gas via

6
00:00:23,381 --> 00:00:28,381
going into town and Gatsby's car and
they see this other car with three m to

7
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,770
black men and white black woman in
the condo and buy what she'll fill.

8
00:00:34,771 --> 00:00:39,060
So that's a kind of very odd
gratuitous reference. Um,

9
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,800
and I just want to, um, pick up on
that and push that a little further,

10
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:48,940
uh, because they actually is kind
of a more important, uh, connection,

11
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:49,680
uh,

12
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,480
of African American music actually
being very important element.

13
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,430
I would say the jazz is,
you know,

14
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:01,380
started out as an is still very
much, um, African American music.

15
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:06,060
So I'm Fitzgerald has written than as
they, this is afterward Greg Gas Bay,

16
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:11,370
but 1931 as a called
echoes of the jazz age. Uh,

17
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,290
and he says it was an age of miracles.
It was an age of odd.

18
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,030
It was an age of access and
it was an age or set higher.

19
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,200
So a lot of those terms,
miracles. Um, there's, um,

20
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:29,940
you've guys probably know this,
there's a very strong, um,

21
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,970
kind of, um, religious language.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,300
A language of Christianity is son of God,

23
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,720
religious language in the great Gatsby
and miracles would be within that domain

24
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:47,180
of religious delusions.
Um, but obviously, uh,

25
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:52,110
with uh, being remapped
onto a secular context, um,

26
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,860
but, um, certainly gas, but you're
someone who would believe in miracles,

27
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:01,160
the miracle of turning time back and
completely erasing the few years of,

28
00:02:02,251 --> 00:02:07,020
um, bases life. Uh, that's the miracle
that really, um, that he wants to achieve.

29
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,070
Um,

30
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:13,070
so miracles what Fitzgerald associates
with the jazz age very much as a fairing

31
00:02:13,861 --> 00:02:17,520
in to have the great Gatsby
access. We know about, um,

32
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,780
and age of art as well.
Um,

33
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,200
and there's actually an
illusion in when it goes to, um,

34
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,090
guest ways piloting the music that
was playing. Um, it's actually, uh,

35
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,780
the jazz history of the world.

36
00:02:30,781 --> 00:02:35,781
So lots of cross references
basically kind of a weapon.

37
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:36,960
Uh,

38
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,960
web of musical web has been a vote and
into the great Gatsby with jazz being

39
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:47,940
the, the genetic ground of that Web. Um,

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
so because with the talking and jazz is
really what's important to the 1920s,

41
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,210
not just to Fitzgerald but
to the entire decade. So, um,

42
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,340
just want bring up some of
the employment figures, um,

43
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,010
the piece called,
what did I do to be so black and blue?

44
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:10,770
That's when specially resonant
peak. Uh, it started out with, um,

45
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:15,260
fast Waller singing it in, in
this behaving. Um, and then, um,

46
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,720
it was picked up,
both played on the trunk but,

47
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:21,300
but also sung by Louis Armstrong.
Um,

48
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,070
and Oh, oh, oh,

49
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:31,420
uh, and um, and then
this is an illusion, uh,

50
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:35,290
to, uh, Louie Armstrong. Um,

51
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,360
there's this illusion to Louis Armstrong
and Ralph Ellison's invisible man.

52
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:47,800
And, um, for some reason
that is not showing up here.

53
00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:52,660
So I will, I must, must have raised that
when I was, um, getting ready for this.

54
00:03:52,661 --> 00:03:53,830
So I'll just read this to you.

55
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:58,460
This is the opening of Ralph
Ellison's invisible man. Um,

56
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:03,870
then somehow I came out of it sending
hastily from this underground of sound to

57
00:04:05,051 --> 00:04:07,840
hear Louis Armstrong in recently asking,

58
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,470
what did I do to be so black and blue?

59
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:17,430
So it very much is something that started
out in music and then cross over into

60
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:23,410
their Azure. Uh, and basically
it was kind of the, um,

61
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,470
under the line,
uh,

62
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:29,380
concede for Ralph Ellison's invisible man.

63
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:32,990
I'll put this back on the
PowerPoint when I, uh,

64
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:37,570
posted to the website. Um,
oh, it's right here. Um,

65
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,960
I can view this way your tricks on
me. Okay. So this is the passage. Um,

66
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,870
and we can um, talk about, um,

67
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,080
music as I'm furnishing a
kind of prometric spectrum to,

68
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:53,530
uh, to a linguistic medium.
Right? You know, we don't, um,

69
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:58,000
thing of language necessarily,
um, as having colors. Um,

70
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:02,470
but language very much has
colors in the way gas page, very,

71
00:05:02,471 --> 00:05:07,150
very striking. Um, Lou
Lou Garden, yellow music,

72
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,210
the blue honey of the Mediterranean,
um,

73
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,720
numerous instances of color have
being used in very abstract ways,

74
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:16,960
um,

75
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,960
to describe the as as kind of operation
basic operation of the linguistic

76
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:26,560
medium. So, um, so based on, on this, uh,

77
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:31,270
the kind of the cross mapping
of music, uh, onto the,

78
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:34,790
onto the language, um, and, and,

79
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:39,940
and the generation of color
as well. I mean, you know,
it's kind of very, very odd.

80
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,390
Um, bad. Um,

81
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:46,000
sight and sound are being combined
in this kind of cross mapping.

82
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:51,390
So I want to bring those back to the word
that we heard last time from as well.

83
00:05:51,641 --> 00:05:52,860
Perkins.
Um,

84
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,680
his complained really that the
great Gatsby is very vague,

85
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,360
that not enough physical details,

86
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,970
not enough info really
about gas bay. Um, and uh,

87
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:08,450
last time we talked about it in terms
of what I would call counter realism,

88
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:13,010
um, and, um, today I'd
like to talk about that,

89
00:06:13,011 --> 00:06:16,480
that sensation of vagueness.
Um,

90
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:21,080
I let him talk about that in terms of
process mapping of sight and sound,

91
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:25,970
because this is not something that we
do all the time. It's not common usage.

92
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,040
Uh, it can create impression of pregnancy
even though once we get used to it,

93
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:34,300
you know, it's just a wonderful, um, um,

94
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,530
strategy that Fitzgerald is using.
Uh,

95
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:41,980
so the three headings that
I like to, um, use, uh,

96
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,380
for this kind of cross
mapping is first of all, uh,

97
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:49,620
all Trey feel with colors. We've
already seen a little bit of that, uh,

98
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:54,680
when Fitzgerald was seemingly
a talking just about sound. Um,

99
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:59,180
but colors, um, operative,
uh, in those descriptions. Um,

100
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:04,210
and then the kind of upwards of that
visual feel with Sam or with noise,

101
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,680
lots of noise. There's same exactly
symmetrical to that, but um,

102
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:14,390
happening on the um, visual. And um,

103
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,440
and then the,

104
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,540
the third really this is the kind of the
central structure that I like to, um,

105
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,270
talk about today,
um,

106
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:27,490
is this kind of visual auditory
coupling as the medic cubs.

107
00:07:27,571 --> 00:07:29,840
And so first of all, we see, um,

108
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:34,870
two characters in the same visual or
the same auditory tableau to people

109
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,470
seemingly accidentally being paired
together. We just see them together.

110
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,410
That's the visual impact of that image.

111
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:47,150
And it turns out that that visual logic,

112
00:07:47,151 --> 00:07:52,151
that visual mode of association
actually has the medic implication.

113
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:54,950
So the visual,

114
00:07:54,951 --> 00:07:59,750
auditory coupling turning into a
thematic couplings are very complicated

115
00:07:59,751 --> 00:08:00,380
structure.

116
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:04,880
But I do think that this is something
that a Fisher works very hard to create.

117
00:08:04,881 --> 00:08:09,560
And this is one of the two
just, just miraculous. It was,

118
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:14,390
I would say, um, um, uh, architecture,
architectural features of the novel.

119
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,110
Um, so, um,

120
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:20,780
first let's just think about
the auditory field with colors.

121
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,170
Um, and this is, uh,

122
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:27,470
actually just still had guessed
based party and nick talking about,

123
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:32,090
um, what he hears there, but
something else as well. Um,

124
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:37,120
the lice grows brighter as the earth
lodges away from the Sun and now the

125
00:08:37,461 --> 00:08:42,461
orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music
and opera of wizards pitchers are key

126
00:08:44,451 --> 00:08:48,800
hire. Um, so it is
really hearing the music.

127
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:53,060
This is the occasion when the jazz
history of the world is being clear.

128
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:53,960
Um,

129
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,830
but it seems that it's impossible
to talk about qualities of sound,

130
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,580
uh,

131
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:04,500
without thinking of visual images
and not even visual images,

132
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:08,500
uh, of the people who were there.
Although they are, certainly,

133
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:13,110
there are plenty of descriptions of those
people, but right now, um, is uh, very,

134
00:09:13,111 --> 00:09:16,630
very, uh, cosmic vision, uh,

135
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,440
after world of Verges,

136
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:23,430
away from the sun is on
that kind of cosmic scale,

137
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,300
astronomical scale,
um,

138
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:31,020
that the yellow cocktail
music is pitching into.

139
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:36,180
Um, so that really the cosmic
reference is coming out of nowhere.

140
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,320
It was very surprising.
Um,

141
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,060
and I'm not sure what to say about it.
And other than that,

142
00:09:42,061 --> 00:09:45,870
it seems very deliberate on, on fish
show up high. So once again, um,

143
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,760
lots and lots of really interesting
details in packed moments,

144
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:51,480
um,

145
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,480
that invited basically compel
us to give interpretation too.

146
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:02,100
Um, so this is one end of the
spectrum. All the we feel with colors.

147
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,650
Um, and so let's go to the
other end of the strap spectrum,

148
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:11,280
the visual optical feel with
noise. Um, and this is once again,

149
00:10:11,281 --> 00:10:12,480
very early,
uh,

150
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,500
when it goes to the big hand in
household for the first time. Um,

151
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:22,410
and this is, um, he sees these days is
his cousin. He hasn't seen her for awhile.

152
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,040
Um, the first image,
um, that he has of days.

153
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,850
It's actually not a daisy alone,
uh,

154
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:33,030
but she's on this couch
with another young woman.

155
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:39,260
The only completely stationary object
in the room was an enormous couch and

156
00:10:41,451 --> 00:10:46,451
wished to young women were Boyd as
though upon an end code barroom balloon,

157
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,410
sorry.

158
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:54,210
They were both in weight and addresses
with wrestling and fluttering as if they

159
00:10:54,211 --> 00:10:58,620
had just been blown back in after
the short flight around the house.

160
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:04,170
I must have stood for a few and no one's
listening to the Webinar and snap of

161
00:11:04,171 --> 00:11:07,590
the curtains and the groom
of a picture on the wall.

162
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,500
Then there was a boom.
As Tom,

163
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:15,501
you can shut the real windows and the
code when died out about the room and the

164
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:22,041
curtains and the rugs and the two young
women balloon slowly to the floor,

165
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:27,770
um, is an amazing image. Uh,

166
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:31,680
and it's that this has a lot
about if you can and household,

167
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,880
it says a lot about things. Uh,
basically is really an, uh, uh,

168
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:41,230
visual, uh, allegory for
the entire novel. Um,

169
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:46,100
the entire novel,
the Great Gatsby can be seen as they say,

170
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:49,440
ballooning, ballooning
up and taking flight. Uh,

171
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:54,610
going back to that
earlier romance, um, with,

172
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:58,090
um, with gas may, uh,

173
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:03,120
but really is just a very racial trail
and she's going to be brought down to

174
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:08,260
earth by Tom. Um, so it's
a really interesting that,

175
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,200
um, there should be this, uh,

176
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:16,870
intensification of what my seeing
a very neutral or very casual,

177
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:23,830
a visual image into something that
carries tremendous. The medic wait, right?

178
00:12:23,831 --> 00:12:27,460
This is basically the whole
story of the great Gatsby.

179
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:31,690
It's been encapsulated,
encapsulated in this one visual image.

180
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:32,620
Um,

181
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:37,620
and what allows this visual image to
have such tremendous thematic way,

182
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,530
it's actually an intrusion
of Sam into that,

183
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:45,880
into that image. Um, if
they had not been solved,

184
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,670
it would not have been
so pregnant with meaning.

185
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:53,320
And the sound has to do
with the whip and snap.

186
00:12:53,321 --> 00:12:54,760
We got the curtains.
Um,

187
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:58,870
it's just remarkable words to use.

188
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:03,670
Curtains, you know, they don't
make sounds like a web or,

189
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,060
um, they don't make snapping songs. Um,

190
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:11,470
so clearly this is the super
imposition of something else.

191
00:13:11,471 --> 00:13:14,260
Much more, uh, brutal,

192
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,320
much more violent images being
super imposed on the tree image.

193
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:24,640
Images being super imposed upon the
otherwise very benign and very harmless

194
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,950
submit by the curtain.
Um,

195
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:31,180
so or rarely the whip and the snap,
uh,

196
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:36,210
already behaving to auditory grant for
the appearance from Thailand of Buchanan,

197
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:41,310
so that when here finally appears towards
the end of the passage is almost not

198
00:13:41,551 --> 00:13:42,101
surprising,

199
00:13:42,101 --> 00:13:45,850
even though he doesn't show up until
the last sentence of the passage.

200
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:50,020
The snap and whip of the
curtains are ready. Um,

201
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,390
carry a senator. So, you know,

202
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:56,230
it's really interesting that Tom
Buchanan is a very physical man. He is,

203
00:13:56,231 --> 00:13:58,150
we know him by his physical attributes,

204
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,830
his body filling up every inch of his
clothes, his riding boots and so on,

205
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,740
a very visual figure.
But nonetheless,

206
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:09,910
fisheries is careful to give an auditory
dimension to Tom. And then the final,

207
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:14,410
all the trade, but he does is to
bring down shut, do rear window.

208
00:14:14,411 --> 00:14:16,630
This is not the rear door,
but as the rear window,

209
00:14:16,631 --> 00:14:20,980
almost as though somebody is trying to
get into his house by the back door or

210
00:14:20,981 --> 00:14:22,330
the back window.
Um,

211
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:27,130
and Tommy Canon is shutting that right
then and there before any action is taken

212
00:14:27,131 --> 00:14:31,770
place. So, you know, this is a
forecast. The rest of the novel, um,

213
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:32,800
is um,

214
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,820
basically it's just a capsule summary
of everything that we need to know about

215
00:14:36,821 --> 00:14:39,400
the great Gatsby. Um, so, um,

216
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:43,080
just to see how carefully crafted this is.
Um,

217
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:47,500
because this is already made because
this comes to us readymade um,

218
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,700
we don't notice how, how much, um,

219
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:55,280
craftsmanship actually
goes into that passage.

220
00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:00,580
So I just wanted to show you a visual
image that is almost similar to theirs up

221
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:04,700
for by very famous
painter. Um, and they, um,

222
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:09,560
and this is a picture of car
both where's Mr is reclining. Um,

223
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,020
we also see the curtains in there,

224
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:17,350
but we just know that those curtains are
not going to make a noise like a web or

225
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:23,030
they're not going to be making, um,
with whipping or snapping sound.

226
00:15:23,031 --> 00:15:25,400
So this is in contrast to his Gerald.

227
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:30,360
This is a visual feel without noise
in this completely visual. Um,

228
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:35,440
it doesn't carry the auditory signature
and auditory manners that as encoded in

229
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:44,330
Fitzgerald, very careful coupler of
sight and sound in his disruption.

230
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:50,080
Um, so, um, we also know, uh,

231
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,420
that they see those in the by
herself, right? So it's very,

232
00:15:53,421 --> 00:15:56,600
very important that she and Julien Baker,

233
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:02,100
the first Glennon's that we have is
after two of them on that enormous couch.

234
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,410
Um,

235
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:08,410
and both occupants of the visual
field that is carries noise.

236
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:14,110
So that is the first common thing
between Jordan Baker and they say less.

237
00:16:15,591 --> 00:16:20,450
Go onto see if that visual
auditory counseling, uh,

238
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:23,000
what does that mean in thematic terms,

239
00:16:23,001 --> 00:16:27,140
how that Stan translate
into futures of the plot.

240
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,130
That may be, we'll also bring
the two of them together. Um,

241
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,070
so I'm telling you what
I'm going to argue with.

242
00:16:34,071 --> 00:16:38,720
It's just the outline of the lecture
and then we'll do the same thing, uh,

243
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,160
with Gatsby and like as well.
But let's just, there's, um,

244
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:47,630
just move on to Jordan Baker. Um, and um,

245
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:52,310
last time we talked about the importance
of, uh, the car of as base Rose Rose.

246
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,150
Um,

247
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:58,010
and the car would really is a key player
and a great Gatsby and all kinds of

248
00:16:58,011 --> 00:17:02,530
contacts. So it turns out
that, um, join Baker, uh,

249
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,010
one very important

250
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:10,250
aspect of a relation to
Ashley revolves around, um,

251
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,113
the car.

252
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:16,630
It was that same house party that we had
a curious conversation about driving a

253
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:23,171
car is started because she passed so
close to some working room than offender

254
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:27,890
flicks a button on one man's coat.

255
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,980
Will Rogen driver I protested.

256
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,180
Either you are to be more careful
or you on to drive at all.

257
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,080
I am careful. No you're
not. Well other people are,

258
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:43,400
she said later there was I got to deal
with it. They'll keep out of my way.

259
00:17:43,401 --> 00:17:47,270
She assisted it takes
two to make an accident.

260
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:52,810
So this says a lot of other motivation
between nick and Jordan Baker and why it

261
00:17:55,681 --> 00:17:57,870
might come to nothing. Um, so, you know,

262
00:17:57,871 --> 00:18:02,871
the Ashley lost of little local
allegories or the entire plot all the way

263
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:07,620
throughout the great Gatsby and
um, and the fact that she is, um,

264
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:13,670
a bad driver who's counting on other
people being careful of to prevent

265
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,380
accidents from happening,

266
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,440
that is not a good basis to
get into the marriage with.

267
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:23,340
And next thing is to know that.

268
00:18:23,341 --> 00:18:27,330
So I mean this is really one of the many
signs that this is not going to come to

269
00:18:27,331 --> 00:18:29,070
anything. Um, but well,

270
00:18:29,071 --> 00:18:33,310
it's also interesting I think
about this particular um,

271
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,600
image of Julien Baker coming by way
of her relation to the automobile is a

272
00:18:41,311 --> 00:18:46,311
notion of accountability that is
perhaps not just limited to Jordan.

273
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:52,000
Baker herself is really an account,
uh,

274
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:57,020
an explanation of why things go wrong
and one's responsibility once input,

275
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:05,220
once contribution to the fact
that something is going on wrong.

276
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:10,670
And for Jordan Baker Accountability is
almost always written over to the other

277
00:19:13,741 --> 00:19:14,400
side.

278
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,190
If there's an accident is because
the other person isn't a good driver.

279
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,800
That's why there's an accident taking,
not taking into account at all.

280
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,800
The fact that she's also a bad driver.

281
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:30,750
I'm just right that it takes two
to make an accident. Um, but the,

282
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:35,460
the explanation there's she's looking
for is that in the other person's fault.

283
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,240
Um,

284
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,240
and we'll see that there are other
characters in the novel who share that

285
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:45,280
understanding of accountability.
Um,

286
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:49,320
kind of a straight attribution
of thought to the other side.

287
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:53,970
Um, so let's see, um, what they say,

288
00:19:53,971 --> 00:19:58,650
how they say relates to the car and
it turns out this year also as a very

289
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:03,600
extremely non trivial relation
to the car. Um, this is,

290
00:20:03,601 --> 00:20:05,230
well they are leaving that um,

291
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,110
terrible scene in New York when
basically Gaspe is just falling apart.

292
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,730
Um, but he's, Tom, um, allows
him to drive these back.

293
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:18,680
So nick that Gatsby and daisy in the car,

294
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:23,730
this is gas. Me telling me what
happened when we left New York.

295
00:20:23,731 --> 00:20:28,230
She was very nervous and she thought
it was there either to drive.

296
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,860
And this woman rushed out of,

297
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,680
just as we were passing a
car coming the other way.

298
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,500
It all happened in a minute,

299
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:41,430
but they seem to me that
she wanted to speak to us,

300
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:45,240
thought we were somebody she knew.
Well,

301
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:49,420
first Nazy turned away from the
woman toward the other than car,

302
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,780
and then she lost her nose and told back.

303
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,920
So as the death of motto
at the hand of Daisy,

304
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,530
and,
um,

305
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:05,610
it is not intentional and I think
that this says a lot about these Z.

306
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,150
Um,

307
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:12,150
Fitzgerald is not portraying
I'm a bad person really.

308
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:17,470
Um, she is a bad driver because
she's lost her nerve. Um,

309
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:22,570
and we really have to be pretty
careful, um, in our assignment of blame.

310
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,910
Um,
I think that Jordan Baker is a very,

311
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:29,840
almost too clear assignment of
blame in putting it squarely, um,

312
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,990
or the other person's site.
Um,

313
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:37,000
and the first Arrow is actually
quite now for, um, about, um,

314
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:42,030
seeing what kind of woman Bec
is another very brief person.

315
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:46,280
Um,
and she's not a very feisty person.

316
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:51,190
She doesn't have steadily is the,
that stood in as of nerve.

317
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,200
Um, and she'll do Susan the nerve at a
critical moment and both at this very

318
00:21:56,201 --> 00:22:00,400
critical moment. But also, uh,
in the kind of abstract way, uh,

319
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:04,000
when gas being needed her to stand by him,

320
00:22:04,001 --> 00:22:06,530
which is really not there for him.
Um,

321
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:11,610
so this is the kind of person she is
and it comes out most dramatically,

322
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:15,140
um, in her handling of the car. Um,

323
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:20,190
but it also comes out in a way that she
handles other affairs of life as well.

324
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,180
Um,

325
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:27,180
so in all those ways we see the same
kind of logic that we saw last time that

326
00:22:28,121 --> 00:22:32,270
it's very important.
Human attributes are rooted,

327
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:36,940
are channeled through, um,
our relation to objects,

328
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:40,030
bases,
relation to the car says a lot.

329
00:22:40,031 --> 00:22:45,010
How about how she would behave you
another go strictly human contacts of

330
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,890
interaction.
Um,

331
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,960
so John Baker and they say we're
joined together at the very beginning,

332
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,910
uh,
by virtue of that visual tableau.

333
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,640
And it turns out that it actually
is a very deep connection. They,

334
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:00,760
they're both bad drivers, uh, although
for bad reasons. So, you know,

335
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,760
we have to be careful as well.
They're both bad drivers.

336
00:23:03,761 --> 00:23:05,610
But in the case of Jordan Baker,

337
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:10,000
she's just much more cavalier about the
whole thing. Whereas Stacy is just not,

338
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:14,200
it's just incompetent and not
very skilled and lacking earth.

339
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:15,250
Um,

340
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:19,900
so let's turn on turn back
now to another coupling.

341
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:24,040
Um, and you guys will notice
that I'm not talking about, um,

342
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:29,170
Gatsby and daisy, the most obvious
couple and the great gas where, uh,

343
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,500
but I want to talk about that a couple of,
uh,

344
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:36,800
in a roundabout fashion actually
by way of Nick and Gasper.

345
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:42,310
And I just want to go back to one various
more point that we talked about much

346
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:47,060
earlier. Um, and which is
about the legacy of Whoa, Whoa,

347
00:23:47,061 --> 00:23:47,781
one,
right.

348
00:23:47,781 --> 00:23:52,100
So we know that nick and
Gas Bay have this in common.

349
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:57,230
They both fought in world war one,
and, um, they both name the, the, the,

350
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,920
the, the unit that they were in. Um,

351
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:04,280
so nick was in the nine machine
gun battalion and gets me,

352
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:06,480
was in the seventh infantry,
um,

353
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:09,690
very precised in naming
the number of that unit.

354
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,850
So erratic. We know that
there's a prior connection, uh,

355
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,370
between the two of them.

356
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:21,371
And I would argue that they also have an
ongoing connection as well because they

357
00:24:22,571 --> 00:24:24,530
are both very, very, uh,

358
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:29,740
sensitive to responsive to and captivated
by a certain quality of sound that

359
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,390
resize and daisies
boys. So, um, it's very,

360
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:39,710
very hard that Neko is,
has no romantic attachment.

361
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:45,040
Two days there should be captivated and
almost exactly the same way that Gatsby

362
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:46,641
is captivated.

363
00:24:46,641 --> 00:24:51,410
It doesn't actually take a romantic
attachment for it to be completely within

364
00:24:51,411 --> 00:24:54,410
the powers of a certain quality of voice.

365
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,650
So like talking about these boys,

366
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:03,100
it was the kind of voice that ear follows
up and down as if each speech isn't an

367
00:25:05,051 --> 00:25:10,051
arrangement of nurse that will never
be the way the Gan her face was sad and

368
00:25:10,311 --> 00:25:15,230
lovely with Bray things and the right
eyes and the brain passionate mouth.

369
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:20,800
But there was an excitement in their
voice that men who had care for her found

370
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:23,410
difficult to forget this thing.

371
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:27,350
Compulsion of wisdoms less than.
Um,

372
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,780
when we look at the visual
description of daisy,

373
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:35,240
um,
it's not very striking.

374
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:39,620
Fitzgerald using very frigid
and narrative was to talk about,

375
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,960
they say the face is sad and lovely.

376
00:25:41,961 --> 00:25:46,961
Would break things and almost no actual
description of the fear of the physical

377
00:25:47,901 --> 00:25:52,460
features on Daisy's phase. So it
actually is a kind of variable, very,

378
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:56,840
um, image of days as we know
that supposedly she's beautiful,

379
00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:01,100
but we don't actually know in what way
she is the exact features that renderer

380
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,530
beautiful.
Um,

381
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:07,590
it is a voice that gives a
very accent rendition of,

382
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,130
they say it is voice
to know the can forget.

383
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:14,390
Nobody who cares about her can forget.
Um,

384
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:19,450
and in this case it is really
the intonation of mortality
rate and I think that

385
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:23,470
for us, um, well I mean now
we can capture as bubbles,

386
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:28,260
legion sound calling
mixed that less, uh, of a,

387
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:32,630
a kind of internationally on
mortality. But, um, it's just,

388
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:37,340
just avoids the, you're here for that one
law and, and you'll never hear it again.

389
00:26:37,341 --> 00:26:42,260
You do have the sense that it's
just that one time and uh, it will,

390
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:45,420
uh,
never again be heard again.

391
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:48,660
You go to a concert
that's not being recorded,

392
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:52,670
then you just know that this is it. Um,
you know, once it's gone, it's gone. Um,

393
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:57,730
and so that partly accounts for the
compulsion that comes from Daisy's voice,

394
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,630
um, that, um,

395
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:05,680
it both is integration of all the hurt
and mortality and this an intonation and

396
00:27:07,081 --> 00:27:11,370
mortality on the part of the
person who is listening to her. Um,

397
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:16,430
let's look at one other description
of this voice coming from neck.

398
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:21,230
Uh, this is something that we
actually read the, but I just started,

399
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,730
would read it again for a moment.

400
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,760
The last sunshine fell out of romantic
affection of Ohio glowing phase before

401
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:32,610
has compelled me forward.
Breathlessly as I listen,

402
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:37,890
that glow faded each light discerning,
more lingering regret,

403
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:42,070
pleasure than meaning of the
lesson street at dusk. Um,

404
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,960
and this was actually in
the context of, um, nick,

405
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:48,610
this is the visit to be Canon Household,
um,

406
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:53,440
and make us just about to found out
about toms affair with myrtle. Um,

407
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,380
so in some sense to count the
fading light is also, um, uh,

408
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:03,300
kind of, uh, created, uh, or
perhaps even an rate of, uh,

409
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:07,650
the randomly feeling light.
Even in the course of that evening.

410
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:12,360
As the phone rings, all the light
goes out, uh, of everyone's face.

411
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,890
Uh, and so, uh, it's, it's,
it's, um, it's, it's the,

412
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:22,220
it's the quality of sound that registry
that registers with dramatic development

413
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:27,540
in that, in that episode. Um, so
let's look up. So you know, as I said,

414
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:32,640
really, you know, doesn't have a
deep relation to today's eight, uh,

415
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,540
but he has a very deep
relation to Daisy's voice. Um,

416
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:41,660
and gas me who was a very deep relation
today say also has very deep information

417
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:46,460
to please. It's for us as well.
Um, and this is the moment, uh,

418
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:51,770
when he's meeting daisy after all
these years and next house. Um,

419
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,500
and uh, we'll read that
passage a little later. Um,

420
00:28:55,530 --> 00:29:00,530
but they conjectures that has been
killing her in his heart for so long that

421
00:29:01,951 --> 00:29:05,040
this is actually not
the big moment for him.

422
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:09,690
This is actually the moment of the led
down that here is this woman who's been

423
00:29:09,691 --> 00:29:14,220
waiting for that you guys doing everything
building up his whole life towards

424
00:29:14,221 --> 00:29:18,100
this moment. Um, and it's
a kind of a let down. Um,

425
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:23,180
and so he niggas notice and in Gaspe and
then something else happens as I watch

426
00:29:25,231 --> 00:29:28,260
him,
he adjusted himself visible way.

427
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:32,640
His hand took hold of
hers and as she says,

428
00:29:32,641 --> 00:29:35,010
something low in his ear,

429
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,910
he turned toward her
with a rush of emotion.

430
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:44,690
I think that voice held him most with
is fluctuating feverish one because it

431
00:29:47,201 --> 00:29:51,500
couldn't be over dreamed
that voice was Adele,

432
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:55,480
this song.
So everything else about days,

433
00:29:55,481 --> 00:30:00,481
they actually could be an is overtrained
and Gaspe almost no staff that he's

434
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,670
project that much,
too much on two days.

435
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:12,960
There was no way she can live up to all
the projections about those years that

436
00:30:13,751 --> 00:30:18,250
he's been involving her. And um, so she,

437
00:30:18,251 --> 00:30:18,761
no one,

438
00:30:18,761 --> 00:30:23,740
no human being is not just the days that
you can live up to that kind of massive

439
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:27,580
projection and the politics of gasping.
No European can.

440
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:33,150
But one thing about daisy can
stand up to that magnification.

441
00:30:34,961 --> 00:30:39,961
Emotional annification application on
a part of daisy of gas made and that is

442
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:44,200
the voice. Um, every time,
anytime he hears his voice,

443
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:48,410
he's captivated, captivated by
her, over the law. Again, as a,

444
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:53,220
everything has really starting right at
that moment. So the voice for the Esa,

445
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:57,030
um, captures the possibility
of fresh beginning. Um,

446
00:30:57,090 --> 00:31:00,780
it seems to have content and is themes
to have arrived in the moment and where,

447
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,750
uh,
gets bits,

448
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:06,700
find the solution with asa and then
that he hears that voice again.

449
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,040
And it's almost as if
there's a fresh start.

450
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,620
And this is really what
Fitzgerald talks about,

451
00:31:11,621 --> 00:31:15,280
about the new world and the fresh
green grass of the new world.

452
00:31:15,281 --> 00:31:20,281
The very end of the great Gatsby is
that some people actually have the

453
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:25,300
capability for endless new beginnings.
You know,

454
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:29,800
your thing that they've come to
the anode Europe, uh, and all that,

455
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:34,030
the come to the end of the dream and all
of a sudden they're selling up all over

456
00:31:34,031 --> 00:31:38,050
again. Um, and that's really
was impressive about gas bay.

457
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,080
Sad and pathetic about Gatsby as well,

458
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:45,220
but also impressive is that
he can always start again,

459
00:31:45,221 --> 00:31:49,270
that passion for gas. You
can always start afresh, um,

460
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:54,050
because of the quality of these staff.
But guess what,

461
00:31:54,051 --> 00:31:55,690
it's not so captivated.

462
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:01,300
Also blindly in love that he
doesn't know what is in that voice.

463
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:07,950
What constitutes that for us or what
gives the voice is magical power.

464
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:11,830
So this is actually a surprisingly,
uh,

465
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:16,720
cleared I evaluation of basis,
voice from gas vapor.

466
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:21,610
The voice is for money.
He said like,

467
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:27,220
that was it. I never understood
before. It was full of money.

468
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:31,300
That was the inexhaustible
charm that rose and fell.

469
00:32:31,301 --> 00:32:34,840
And then the jingle of it,
the symbol song of it,

470
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:38,380
hi in a white powers,
the king's daughter,

471
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:43,800
the so usually people who are madly in
love and not so great and analyzing the

472
00:32:47,511 --> 00:32:52,370
nature of the object that they
have in a kind of surprising move,

473
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:57,350
gasping actually is very analytical
here and completely right. Um, that,

474
00:32:57,351 --> 00:33:01,130
that really is the power of the easy.

475
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:06,020
That in some sense she used to go and
go in a very literal sense that it is to

476
00:33:06,021 --> 00:33:10,980
go, that makes for that Goldman's
of the say, um, that, uh,

477
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
that's really what creates her,
that gives her initial, uh,

478
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:20,740
magic over a gas bay when he
was just a poor young boy. Um,

479
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:25,810
and that's what makes of continue
magic of they say that yes,

480
00:33:26,331 --> 00:33:29,630
this is an Asian miracle, um, as, um,

481
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:34,150
as as Fitzgerald assess
and, um, about jazz. Um,

482
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,980
but it is an Asian miracle,
um,

483
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:42,070
underwritten by two miracle
creating power of gold.

484
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:47,210
Um, this is really what the
novel is about is um, this,

485
00:33:47,211 --> 00:33:49,270
this magic in as well.
Um,

486
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:54,310
but it's coming from a basically
an inanimate nonhuman source.

487
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:55,760
Um,

488
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,760
and I'm a human being can quite often
be the creation of that miracle working

489
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:05,840
substance goal. Um, so, um,

490
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,850
so far we've seen the two of them,
uh,

491
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:13,490
being completely catch captivated
by, by this, his voice. Um,

492
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,500
but nick and gas may also have
something else in common as well.

493
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:20,660
Um,
and in that,

494
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:25,610
even though sung is what keeps them
going for a good part of the novel, um,

495
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:29,810
Ashley at some point,
Sam is also extinguish for them.

496
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:34,900
So let's look at the mode by which song
is being extinguished for each of them.

497
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:37,040
Um,
and not surprisingly,

498
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:40,640
those come at the end of the novel
because when sound and sustain,

499
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:43,640
which that's also a signal that
novel was coming to an end.

500
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:46,520
So here is um,

501
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:51,980
nick actually watching Tom and daisy
after the accident when Tom Daisy back in

502
00:34:52,521 --> 00:34:53,480
the house,
um,

503
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:57,500
and nick is outside and so he's watching
the two of them and all I can see is

504
00:34:57,501 --> 00:35:01,880
this visual tableau of Tom and they see
it but he can hear what they're saying.

505
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:06,650
Um, and I think we can really actually
get them more dramatic moment when you can

506
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,350
only see but not here they say.

507
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:14,350
And Tom was sitting opposite each other
at the kitchen table with a plate of

508
00:35:14,451 --> 00:35:17,930
coal fried chicken between
them and two bottles of our,

509
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:23,470
he was talking intently across the
table at her and his earnestness,

510
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:29,350
his hand had fallen upon and
covered her own once in awhile.

511
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:34,410
She looked up at him and
nodded in agreement there
weren't happy and neither of

512
00:35:35,721 --> 00:35:37,910
them had touched the chicken,
all the gale.

513
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,130
And yet they weren't unhappy either.

514
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:47,150
There was an unmistakable heir of
national intimacy about the picture and

515
00:35:47,821 --> 00:35:51,240
anybody with us then that
they were conspiring together.

516
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:56,630
So this absolutely is the happy
ending and heavy quotation marks,

517
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,370
uh,
for daisy and Tom,

518
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:03,000
the reconstitution of that marriage,
um,

519
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:07,560
that had come under so much
threat from both sides,

520
00:36:07,561 --> 00:36:12,300
modal and Gatsby. And this is another
way in which mother and Gatsby,

521
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,910
um, uh, linked together. They're both

522
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:19,830
people are coming from a
different social circle, um,

523
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:24,840
trying to destroy that marriage.
Um, they are not successful.

524
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,590
The marriage survives. Um,
and this is the comedy.

525
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:33,740
This is the happy ending for Tom and
daisy and the nature of that comedy.

526
00:36:34,861 --> 00:36:39,300
And obviously I'll be, and ironic
here, the nature of the comedy, um,

527
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,650
is that, uh, it's just the
two of them. So, you know,

528
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:47,720
really the marriages between the two of
them are even her cousin can only watch,

529
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,770
uh, but cannot actually here what has
been said between the two of them. Um,

530
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,270
so this is,
um,

531
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,400
a happy moment for Tom and daisy that
for NEC has to the experience as silence,

532
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:06,630
uh,
from the part of Basie and from Tom.

533
00:37:06,631 --> 00:37:10,990
He so used to hearing her
voice in this one, um,

534
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:14,100
instant.
He is not hearing those always alarmed.

535
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:18,040
That's because she's talking to Thomas
was not talking to nick. So, um,

536
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:20,190
let's look at a comparable,

537
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:24,970
a symmetrical moment of
sound being extinguished, uh,

538
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:29,990
by gas. This is a truly unforgettable
moment. And uh, once again, the,

539
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:33,260
the other objects that uh, within, um,

540
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:37,200
all the artists that are important
in the first part of the great Gatsby

541
00:37:37,201 --> 00:37:41,610
actually come back and play a
very important one. So the snow,

542
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:46,440
the establishing of staff for gas and
towards the end of the great Gatsby

543
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:49,740
actually comes by way of telephone.
Um,

544
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:53,180
nothing coming through to
him from the telephone.

545
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:56,910
He was waiting for obviously
for the coffin. Daisy,

546
00:37:56,911 --> 00:37:59,150
no telephone message arrived,

547
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:04,400
but the Butler when without sleep
and waited for it until four o'clock,

548
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,940
until long after there was
anyone to give it to. Evan came,

549
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,010
I have an idea.

550
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:16,040
The gas himself didn't believe it would
come and perhaps that you no longer care

551
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:22,640
if that was true. He must have
felt that he had lost all warm,

552
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,400
well paid,

553
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:28,470
a high price for living too
long with a single dream.

554
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:33,980
He must've looked up at an unfamiliar
sky through frightening leaves.

555
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:40,050
And should I say a little
road to has claim arose is,

556
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,480
and how raw the soundbite was upon us.

557
00:38:43,481 --> 00:38:46,930
The ghastly created grass.
Um,

558
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:52,050
we see the fairy carefully plan transition
from the silence of the telephone

559
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:59,050
once again to us frequently
visional tableau. Um,

560
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:03,370
so this is exactly
symmetrical to the seen,

561
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:07,900
witnessed by nature,
um, the suspension, uh,

562
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:11,150
non appearance of sad,
um,

563
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:14,470
and then the domination
of the visual field.

564
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:16,780
And now finally,

565
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:20,530
business or visual feel without some,

566
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,630
it hasn't been the case before.

567
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:25,810
It's been a visual field
with Sam here is low.

568
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:30,840
And when we get the visual feel without
sa and all of a sudden it's a protest

569
00:39:31,241 --> 00:39:34,610
field, we don't tend to think of the
rose cause a very core task thing.

570
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:38,710
But when you're bad up close to the rose,
when you're saying it and such,

571
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:43,810
my new futures, the rose becomes a very
grotesque, unbearable to look at really.

572
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:48,460
Um, and that's really what the world
is for, for, for gasping at that point.

573
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,530
So, um, right now we've, um,
talk about the two of them.

574
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:57,070
Um, Nate and gasp as if they were
almost exactly of like, right. You know,

575
00:39:57,071 --> 00:40:00,970
they just seem, this is very strong
symmetry between the two of them,

576
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:04,270
but honestly this is really non exactly.

577
00:40:04,271 --> 00:40:08,710
I experienced those two characters
either as we read the Great Gatsby,

578
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,550
the two of them,

579
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:13,750
and also exactly like that they are
so that they are interchangeable.

580
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:18,280
Um, so, um, I want now to start another,

581
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:23,530
uh, train of thought that
actually points to a difference.

582
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:27,900
The train neck and gas
bear, um, nick against bit,

583
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:29,530
um, have, uh,

584
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:34,830
very important common grog up to a certain
point and then they dive for church

585
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:39,940
after that, after the point. So as
Trey's, the divergence between the,

586
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,630
it turns out that Sung is extinguish,
uh,

587
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:48,700
for nec in Jude Romantic scenes,
not hearing daisy talking to Tom.

588
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:52,360
That's one moment, but there's
another one, not as dramatic,

589
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:56,140
but equally consequential for him.
Um,

590
00:40:56,230 --> 00:41:00,190
and actually it also comes by
way of a phone conversation.

591
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:05,170
So at least there's that cemetery
between [inaudible] and gas. Me as well.

592
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:09,000
Um, but here's a, they
talking to John Baker.

593
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:14,760
Suppose I don't go to Southampton and
this is after they accident. Uh, so those,

594
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:18,110
I don't go to Southampton and
come into towns after afternoon.

595
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:23,140
No I don't think this afternoon very
well is impossible this afternoon.

596
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,153
Various,

597
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:29,470
we talk like that for awhile
and then abruptly we weren't,

598
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,840
sorry we weren't talking any longer.

599
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:35,780
I didn't know of us hung
up with the shop clip,

600
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,720
but I know I didn't care.

601
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:44,410
So here too is a phone conversation
that simply turns into the kind of non

602
00:41:47,481 --> 00:41:52,430
conversation and then silence
descending on the two of them.

603
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,330
So it seems this thing
obviously is very free,

604
00:41:56,331 --> 00:42:01,040
close to the silence or
telephone for guests with,

605
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:04,760
but there is a crucial difference.

606
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:09,790
Nick had conjecture earlier that gas
began care if the phone call came or not.

607
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:15,140
But that's obviously not true. How
will he not care? It was devastating.

608
00:42:15,141 --> 00:42:19,400
It was devastating. But there was no
phone call from, from, from, from,

609
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:20,263
from daisy.

610
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:25,450
But this is the moment when
nick truly doesn't really care.

611
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:29,840
And he doesn't care because of who he is.

612
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:35,080
So now we've come to a very important
providing of the ways between nick and

613
00:42:36,771 --> 00:42:40,940
Gatsby. Gatsby is someone
who actually cares so much.

614
00:42:40,941 --> 00:42:45,380
There's almost as if there's no reason
for them to live after that moment. Um,

615
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:48,950
and so, you know, it's fitting that he
should die right then and there. Um,

616
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:52,760
the pilot was kind of
reflecting his psychology, um,

617
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:57,820
but make to someone who doesn't care and
who survives in some sense because he

618
00:42:58,641 --> 00:43:02,770
doesn't care. So here's a
moment to go back to, um,

619
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:07,880
Sunday that Fitzgerald and
Hemingway actually have in common.

620
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:12,830
We talked a lot about the
logic of substitution and
having weight and especially

621
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:17,020
the [inaudible] horse being the
substitute for the picador, uh,

622
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:19,910
when a ball is charting. Um,
so there's a very important,

623
00:43:19,911 --> 00:43:22,460
largely goes up to tuition in Hemingway.

624
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:27,910
And it turns out that there's also a
logic of substitution in the great Gatsby

625
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,233
as well,

626
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:34,450
is if only because the worst substitute
is actually use by Fitzgerald,

627
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:40,650
um, once again in seemingly
with two of those contacts.

628
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:44,010
So this is the family
history of neck caraway.

629
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:49,600
The actual founder of my life was my
grandfather's brother who came here in 51

630
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:55,700
send a substitute to the civil war,

631
00:43:56,270 --> 00:44:01,270
has started the wholesale hardware
business that my father carries on today.

632
00:44:02,811 --> 00:44:05,060
Okay.
This entire passage,

633
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:10,570
when we first read it seems to nothing
to do with the rest of the novel.

634
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,480
You know,

635
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:16,480
why would we care whether or not
back one generation and now even his

636
00:44:17,751 --> 00:44:22,340
grandfather. But it's when
his uncle great uncle, um, uh,

637
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:23,870
send a substitute,
didn't fight.

638
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,900
So this actually has a lot in
common with the Hemingway story.

639
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:31,980
This is some one who doesn't fight his
own battles and as a substitute to fight

640
00:44:31,981 --> 00:44:36,030
for him and to suffer with him
in the civil war. Um, and um,

641
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:40,410
and then as a consequence of surviving
because of not having died in,

642
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:44,700
so while being able to found a
very successful hardware business.

643
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:50,030
So all these details about Nick's family
history at the moment when it appears

644
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:55,740
very early com, first opening
pages of the Great Gatsby, um,

645
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:58,860
seems simply just to stand
there and to be doing nothing.

646
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:03,140
And it's only in hindsight that,
um,

647
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:07,150
we can imbue meaning.

648
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:12,200
We can retrospectively impute and meaning
to our original seemingly gratuitous

649
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:14,400
detail.
Um,

650
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:19,460
and it really has to do with the vital
difference between Gas Bay and Nick.

651
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:25,610
And here is this moment when just before,
uh,

652
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:28,260
gas phase captivated by
and pieces was again,

653
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:33,530
this is the moment of this
illusion but also we illusion,

654
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:38,820
um, than, than it gives no
listening and gasping. Uh,

655
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,870
there must have been [inaudible]
even that afternoon when there is a,

656
00:45:42,871 --> 00:45:46,410
is a Moo Shu sure of his dreams,
not through home,

657
00:45:46,411 --> 00:45:50,970
fall through because of the colossal
vitality, obviously illusion.

658
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:53,700
It had gone beyond the,
beyond.

659
00:45:53,701 --> 00:45:58,701
Everything hits from ind himself
into it with a creative passion,

660
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:01,140
adding to it all the time,

661
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:05,580
decking it out with every bright
feather that drifted his way.

662
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:11,300
No amount of fire or freshness can
challenge with American store up in this

663
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:13,990
ghostly hot.

664
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:18,900
So this is really why
gas bay is what he is,

665
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:24,290
is that he has this enormous
storage capacity in his goes late,

666
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:30,660
hard and it was store on daisy
will be stored there forever.

667
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,130
It almost doesn't matter who, who she
is, what she really turns out to be.

668
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,710
And what he finds,
what he realized,

669
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:41,880
we finally realized is what she is.
It almost doesn't matter.

670
00:46:41,881 --> 00:46:46,881
It has no relation to reality at all
off because it is strictly a dream about

671
00:46:48,251 --> 00:46:51,720
days, a bad gas, the histo
in his own heart and mind.

672
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:55,730
So the colossal vitality
of illusion in Dallas.

673
00:46:55,770 --> 00:47:00,120
What death is about daisy and gas base.
Oh mine.

674
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:05,150
And what enables gas bay today deathless
to some extent as well in spite of his

675
00:47:05,341 --> 00:47:10,170
physical biological that um,
with nick is the other way around.

676
00:47:10,171 --> 00:47:13,980
So just want to read you,
um, why he doesn't care. Um,

677
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:18,600
and why it turns out that
his family business is the,

678
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:20,730
is the hardware business.
Um,

679
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:25,160
it is someone who can never be
hurt by anything that happens. Uh,

680
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:29,190
10 [inaudible] was [inaudible] is honors.

681
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:34,330
She wasn't able to enjoy
being at a disadvantage and
given this on willingness,

682
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:39,340
I suppose she had begun
dealing and subterfuges when
she was very young and all

683
00:47:39,341 --> 00:47:41,980
that to keep that cool insulin smile,

684
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:47,310
turn to the world and yet satisfy the
demands of her heart Shaunti body.

685
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:54,120
We have seen gas may and
very analytical about these,

686
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:55,750
right that she is,

687
00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:00,960
the voice is full of money and here
is performing a comparable analytic

688
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:08,880
operation on children Baker that
she's just encapsulate as honest.

689
00:48:08,961 --> 00:48:10,390
You can bear to lose.

690
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:15,660
She would do anything she can to and
he is rape that rate about joining.

691
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:19,930
And that's why, you know, the
marriage is not going to take place.

692
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:25,060
But one of that is not even that she's
nice, such a great marriage companion. Um,

693
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:30,120
it is that they really doesn't even care
enough to be hurt by that realization.

694
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:33,880
Um,

695
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:38,880
he is insulated by the emotional hardware
that has been his family's business

696
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:44,740
for these two generations.
Um,

697
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:49,800
and so that's why the family history is
so important to nick and why he really

698
00:48:50,681 --> 00:48:52,780
needs a substitute,
uh,

699
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:57,810
because he is simply incapable of feeling
the kind of apps to see that gaspy is

700
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:01,480
capable of feeling,

701
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:06,810
nor is he capable of feeling
the devastation that as
beer is capable of feeling.

702
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:12,000
Those two go ahead and hand. You get
ecstasy, you get those Asian, um,

703
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:16,780
and nick is not capable of either.
Um, and that's why he's such a good,

704
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:18,570
such good friends with,

705
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:23,140
with Guzman was always standing by
gasping because he really needs that in

706
00:49:23,141 --> 00:49:27,160
direct experience of what it feels to be

707
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:30,010
in the gas space mind.

708
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:34,700
And to have that ghostly hard with
his mere was storage capacity.

709
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:38,680
Um, so anyway, um, this is, um, um,

710
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:43,090
of kind of Fitzgerald's way of
encouraging us to think about different

711
00:49:43,091 --> 00:49:45,220
constellations, right?
Different configuration,

712
00:49:45,221 --> 00:49:47,720
different constellations of characters,
um,

713
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:51,950
and nick and Gatsby and not
the most obvious couple. Uh,

714
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:56,680
but it turns out that actually the whole
story of the great Gatsby can be taught

715
00:49:56,681 --> 00:49:59,890
by looking at this nontraditional couple.
Uh,

716
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,690
and I'll encourage you in session two.

717
00:50:01,691 --> 00:50:03,700
Think of other nontraditional
couples as well,

718
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:07,540
and we'll turn to a fist to Faulkner.
That's weak.
