[whistles]
Hey.

00:00:03.903 --> 00:00:06.139
(Forrest voice-over)
Being happy about everything
the universe brought my way

00:00:06.172 --> 00:00:08.808
was clearly a bizarre way
to go through life.

00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:10.243 align:end position:100%
Hey, Lucille,
look who found

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:12.412 align:end position:100%
some effective sunscreen
after all.

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:14.313
(Forrest voice-over)
And it was made all the more
complicated

00:00:14.346 --> 00:00:16.616
by a surprise visit
from my ex-wife.

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:18.751 align:start position:0%
Oh, Suzanne.
Oh, wow.

00:00:18.784 --> 00:00:20.086
Oh, great. Okay.

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:21.854 align:end position:100%
Could you
put the parasol down?

00:00:21.887 --> 00:00:24.690
- I'd be happy to.
- I just want to sit and talk.

00:00:24.723 --> 00:00:26.259
- Oh.
- The thing is, Forrest...

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:28.461
- Uh-huh.
- I've decided that what would

00:00:28.494 --> 00:00:30.463 align:end position:100%
be best for me,
and for Eric--

00:00:30.496 --> 00:00:31.998 align:end position:100%
would be best for
both of us,

00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:33.833
- Mm-hmm.
- Is if we were to have...

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:36.502 align:start size:72% position:28%
a little break from you

00:00:36.535 --> 00:00:39.972 size:88% position:56%
and whatever effect that you
may be having on our lives.

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:41.841
(Forrest voice-over)
This was terrible news,

00:00:41.874 --> 00:00:43.943
but given the parameters
of this review,

00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:46.312
there was only one way
to react.

00:00:48.013 --> 00:00:50.950 align:start position:0%
[chuckles]

00:00:52.485 --> 00:00:54.454
- Yay. [laughs]
- Yay?

00:00:54.487 --> 00:00:56.289 align:start position:0%
Well, yeah.
I think it's--

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:57.790
- I think that's great.
- You do?

00:00:57.823 --> 00:00:59.559 align:start position:0%
I do.
I do, I do, I do, I do.

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:01.527
- [laughs]
- Oh, okay,

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.129 align:end position:100%
'cause I-I--
you know, I'm surprised.

00:01:03.162 --> 00:01:05.465 align:start size:78% position:22%
I thought you were gonna,
like, literally freak out

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:06.999 align:end position:100%
and start,
like, throwing things

00:01:07.032 --> 00:01:08.167
- and...
- [laughs]

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.069 align:start position:0%
No, I can see why
that's a good idea.

00:01:10.102 --> 00:01:11.504
- Okay. Okay.
- Yeah.

00:01:11.537 --> 00:01:13.673 align:end position:100%
Well, good, because I--
what I would like to do...

00:01:13.706 --> 00:01:15.808
- Uh-huh?
- Is for you to waive

00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:17.410
all of your visitation rights

00:01:17.443 --> 00:01:20.579 align:end position:100%
and have no contact
with us at all.

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:25.418 size:84% position:42%
Bye-bye, visitation rights.

00:01:25.451 --> 00:01:27.887
- [chuckles]
- Are you okay?

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.622
- Yeah. Yup.
- What is this?

00:01:29.655 --> 00:01:30.857 align:end position:100%
Are you on something,
or...

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.425 align:start position:0%
No, I'm not on anything,
I'm just--

00:01:32.458 --> 00:01:34.327 align:start position:0%
I'm just--
What you're saying

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.962
- makes me happy.
- It does?

00:01:35.995 --> 00:01:37.196 align:start position:0%
It does.
It really makes me happy.

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.931 align:end position:100%
To not see me and Eric
at all?

00:01:38.964 --> 00:01:42.335 align:start position:0%
Um, how long were you
thinking for the break?

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:44.971 align:end position:100%
Well, I was thinking
something around two months.

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:46.973 align:end position:100%
For starters.
With no contact...

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:48.541
(Forrest voice-over)
If I weren't so very happy,

00:01:48.574 --> 00:01:50.743
I might have begged her
to change her mind.

00:01:50.776 --> 00:01:52.778
- Hooray.
- Hooray?

00:01:52.811 --> 00:01:54.981 align:start position:0%
Yes. See, I think
two months is gonna go by

00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:56.382 align:start position:0%
just like that!
[laughs]

00:01:56.415 --> 00:01:57.850
(Forrest voice-over)
And the happy news kept coming.

00:01:57.883 --> 00:01:59.252
(man) Are you Forrest MacNeil?
- Yes, I am.

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:00.553 align:start position:0%
Stand up and put
your hands behind your head.

00:02:00.586 --> 00:02:01.787 align:end position:100%
You're under arrest
for homicide.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:02.855
- Okay, uh...
- What's happening?

00:02:02.888 --> 00:02:03.990
(Suzanne) Homicide?
- Stand up.

00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:05.191 align:end position:100%
Put your hands
behind your head.

00:02:05.224 --> 00:02:06.359
(Suzanne)
Forrest, what did you do?

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:07.593
Yay! It's great to hear
my rights.

00:02:07.626 --> 00:02:09.095 align:end position:100%
You have the right
to remain silent...

00:02:09.128 --> 00:02:10.263
There they go. I'm so glad
for the Constitution.

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:11.397 align:end position:100%
You have the right
to an attorney.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.498 align:start position:0%
I'm so glad we
got rid of the king...

00:02:12.531 --> 00:02:13.900 align:end position:100%
If you cannot afford
an attorney...

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:15.201
- So we have rights now.
- One will be provided for you.

00:02:15.234 --> 00:02:16.302 align:end position:100%
(Suzanne)
Forrest, did you kill somebody?

00:02:16.335 --> 00:02:17.570 align:start position:0%
I will see you
in two months, Suzanne!

00:02:17.603 --> 00:02:18.905 align:start size:25% position:75%
Forrest!

00:02:18.938 --> 00:02:21.938 align:start position:0%
(Forrest)
I get to take a ride
in a police car!
