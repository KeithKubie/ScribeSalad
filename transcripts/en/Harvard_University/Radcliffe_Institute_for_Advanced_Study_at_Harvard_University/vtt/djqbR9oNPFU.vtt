00:00:05.844 --> 00:00:07.700
- Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.010
Glad to see so many of you here.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:10.980
I'm Liz Cohen.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.400
I'm Dean of the Radcliffe
Institute for Advanced Study,

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.770
and I'm so happy you
could be here to join us

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.790
for today's panel, entitled,
Hidden in Plain Sight, Family

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.340
Secrets and American History.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.610
As Harvard's Institute
for Advanced Study,

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.870
Radcliffe has a dual mission.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.950
We support cutting edge work
across the arts, the sciences,

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.370
the social sciences,
and the humanities,

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.480
and we share that work with
broad public audiences.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.280
We offer a packed
calendar of events,

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.870
including lectures, conferences,
exhibitions, and panel

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.870
discussions like the one
we're about to hear today.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.870
You can find more information
about all of our programming

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.490
on our website.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.770
Now today, our
distinguished panelists

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.130
will share what they have
learned about uncovering

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.260
hidden family histories.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
And I'm grateful to all
of them for joining us,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.020
and I look forward
to their insights.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.930
As we dive into this
fascinating topic,

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.670
I think we will see that rich
and revealing archives do not

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.550
only live in libraries,
but they can also

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.140
be found in basements,
closets, and attics.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.480
Whether a diary, a letter,
a photograph, or a deed,

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.000
these documents
reveal truths that

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.090
matter for relatives
and for descendants,

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.690
but they also contribute to
our understanding of history

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.350
more broadly.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.920
The unique window
into lived experience

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.630
that family artifacts can reveal
makes it all the more important

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.160
that some of them find their way
into manuscript repositories,

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.030
where they can be properly
preserved, cataloged, and made

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.410
available to researchers to
tell a more nuanced and complex

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.150
American history.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.130
Radcliffe's Schlesinger
Library on the History

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.370
of Women in America, which
organized today's event,

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.590
is the preeminent
archive documenting

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.680
the history of women and
gender in this country,

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.400
and it houses an incredible
collection of these artifacts,

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.330
among many other
important materials.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.880
Because libraries
like the Schlesinger

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.420
play such a crucial role
in facilitating the writing

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.210
and analyzing of
American history,

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.950
we are now particularly focused
on diversifying our collections

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.130
to make sure that they are
preserving a full spectrum

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.880
of women's experiences
across class, race,

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.980
political perspective,
sexual orientation,

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.640
religious experience, and more.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.430
We have also prioritized
expanding access

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.620
to the library's
valuable resources

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.850
by digitizing its most
sought after collections.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.070
We face other new
challenges, as we

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.000
seek to ensure that scholars
and students in the future

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.190
will have all the
evidence they need

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.840
to write responsible and
inclusive histories of today.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.740
With so much of the human
record we produce nowadays

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.490
being ephemeral, whether
a text message, an email,

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.730
or a blog post, the
Schlesinger is actively

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.070
collecting and
preserving materials

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.350
that were created
electronically,

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.050
referred to as born
digital, whether

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.080
e-correspondence or
online magazines,

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.510
or any of the many
other ways that we

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.810
record private and
public interactions

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.330
in our contemporary culture.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.000
Jane Kamensky, my colleague
in the History Department here

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.090
at Harvard, and the Karlen
Lily Pforzheimer Foundation

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.220
director of the
Schlesinger Library

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.590
has been leading these
efforts, with the help

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.450
of her partner,
Marilyn Dunn, who

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.330
is the executive director
of the Schlesinger,

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.490
and their expert staff.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.450
Jane is an historian of early
America, the Atlantic World,

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.840
and the Age of Revolutions,
with a particular interest

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.610
in the history of families.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.190
And I want to thank
Jane and her team

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.440
for organizing today's event.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.420
And in just a moment
I will invite Jane up

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.050
to introduce our panelists
and our moderator.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.990
But first let me tell you
how things will work today.

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.360
After the panel
discussion, we will open

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.290
the floor for your questions.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.100
We'll be placing a microphone
in the center aisle.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.730
We invite you to come up,
introduce yourself first.

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.450
That's important for us
all to know who's speaking.

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.460
Ask your question.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.340
And then the next
person will have a turn.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.330
After the Q&amp;A, I invite you
all to join us next door

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.510
for a reception in the
Sheerr Room of Fay House.

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.600
Now please extend a warm
welcome to Jane Kamensky.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.015
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.790
- Good afternoon, everybody,
and welcome on behalf

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.300
of the Schlesinger Library,
about which Liz just

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.520
said such very nice things.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.650
When we sponsor events, we try
to keep several goals in view.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.400
We embody Radcliffe's commitment
to bring cutting edge thinking

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.180
to the public, and to
advance the work of scholars,

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.410
exploring topics related to
women, gender, and sexuality.

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.260
We also use events
like this to expose

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.200
our collections and the
kinds of work they do,

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.960
and to build relationships
with people whose papers we

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.120
hope to collect in future.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.300
And today's panel discussion,
Hidden in Plain Sight,

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.630
or HIPS, as the staff
has taken to calling it,

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.030
does all of these things.

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.740
The conversation
that brings together

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.680
these four amazing panelists
under the direction

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.910
of our gifted moderator
has a high concept premise,

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.400
and I wanted to take a
few moments to describe it

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.040
before introducing our guests.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.420
So Hidden in Plain Sight borrows
the title of a wonderful book

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.900
by the Rutgers
University sociologist,

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.550
Eviatar Zerubavel--

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.970
a study of what Zerubavel
calls, the social structure

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.700
of irrelevance.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.640
He's interested in
what gets noticed,

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.910
what counts as figure
in art history terms,

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.510
and what gets reduced
to field or background.

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.850
He writes that
nothing is inherently

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.790
figure-like or background-like.

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:27.000
Instead, we make judgments
about what gets seen

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.970
and what stays hidden.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.370
And the book's cover features
the work-- a different image--

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.610
but the work of this
artist, Liu Bolin, whose art

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.650
plays with exactly this issue.

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:41.010
So this slide is
Liu's Instillation,

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:43.860
Hiding in The City Number 110.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.800
And though the artist is
standing right in front of us,

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.360
we have to really be
looking for him to see him.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.470
We're conditioned to see the
detritus of consumer society,

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:58.350
this work argues,
and that conditioning

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.780
makes it increasingly
impossible for us

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.180
to see human relationships.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.390
In other words, for Liu
and for the sociologist,

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:09.150
Zerah Bible, what
hides in plain sight

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:13.620
shows us a lot about who
we are and how we think.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.610
Our panelist Alice Echols
notes that psychologists

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:21.420
have another word for
this unknown knowledge--

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:25.800
those half-seen truths that
haunt most American families--

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.600
nescience, they call it.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.420
That feeling just
short of consciousness.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.560
And so to American families,
a core, as Liz said,

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.250
of Schlesinger
Library collections.

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.740
All of us have family secrets--

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:44.940
issues big and small, that hide
in plain sight in our families,

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:48.990
known but unseen,
or seen but unknown.

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:53.400
Collections of family papers
are full of nescience.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.920
Most times these
have no importance

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.870
beyond the family circle.

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:01.800
Like, for example, the fact that
my paternal grandmother claimed

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.890
on her marriage license
to have wed at 17,

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:08.850
but was shown on her birth
certificate to be only 14.

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:10.380
This is true.

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.570
And this was
secret, but it's not

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:17.930
a secret that opens a new
vista onto American history.

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:21.650
The family truths our panelists
hold to the light in the four

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:23.900
projects they're
discussing this afternoon

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.210
are of a different order.

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:30.200
Big questions in American
and even in global history

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.110
determine what truths
needed to be hidden

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:37.070
by members of the Calhoun and
Faludi and Davis and Wagner

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:38.000
families--

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.169
what could be seen and
what stories would be told?

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:46.130
The ways their families
organized field and background

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:48.170
in turn shaped the
broader history

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:51.740
of the 19th and 20th centuries.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.540
Before turning the
panel over, I'll

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.910
introduce the panelists in
the order they'll speak,

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.520
which is alphabetically
by last name,

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:02.370
and say way too little about
each of their projects.

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:05.330
First up will be author
Gail Lumet Buckley,

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.330
whose three books all
center, to some degree,

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:12.890
on a trunk of papers kept by
her grandfather, Teddy Horne,

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:15.180
and passed down
through the family,

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:19.130
including his famous daughter,
Gail's mother, the actor

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:22.520
and musical icon, Lena Horne.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.910
Gail, who was an honors
graduate of Radcliffe College

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:28.460
and a journalist,
is also a biographer

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:31.400
who has published in the Los
Angeles Times, the Washington

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.890
Post, Vogue, Playboy,
and People, among others.

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:38.480
And she has reckoned
with that family legacy

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.880
through much of
her writing life.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.390
Her first two books, The
Hornes: An American Family,

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:46.880
and American Patriots:
The Story of Blacks

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.160
in the Military from
the Revolution to Desert

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:54.350
Storm spring in parts directly
from Teddy Hornes' trunk.

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:57.050
She'll talk today about her
most recent book, The Black

00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:00.740
Calhouns, which takes
her storied family back

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:04.310
into the days of slavery
and reconstruction,

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:07.940
where their history braided with
the family of John C. Calhoun

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.090
and his brother, Andrew.

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:14.420
The black Calhouns were
oppressed, but not hidden,

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:18.080
Buckley emphasized when
the panels spoke by phone

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.610
a couple of weeks ago.

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:22.490
Their lives were entwined
with the broadest outlines

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:26.360
of American history,
including slavery, war,

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.730
and the long Civil
Rights Movement--

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:31.400
institutions and
events and movements

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.190
that they shaped in turn.

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:38.060
Speaking second is Alice Echols,
who holds the Barbara Streisand

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.100
Chair of Contemporary
Gender Studies

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:43.970
and is also professor of history
at the University of Southern

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:45.950
California.

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:49.340
Echols is one of the foremost
historians of American culture

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.530
in the post-war era.

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:53.750
Her books include,
the field-defining,

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:58.040
Daring to be Bad: Radical
Feminism in America, 1967

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.520
to '75, which followed
the lives and thought

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.970
of many of the activists
whose papers eventually landed

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:06.440
at the Schlesinger.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.410
But Echols wrote about
them before their archives

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:12.560
were anywhere, preceding
largely by interview

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.610
to map a story that nobody
else had managed to recover,

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:19.190
much less make sense of.

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:21.650
Her subsequent
books, each of which

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:24.160
has won various
forms of acclaim,

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.240
include, Scars of
Sweet Paradise,

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.570
a biography of Janis
Joplin, and Hot Stuff:

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:33.190
Disco and the Remaking
of American Culture.

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:36.470
Shortfall, the project about
which she'll talk today

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:39.140
is in many ways a
departure for her.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:42.380
It's a family history,
centering on the life and times

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:45.230
of her grandfather, a
savings and loan founder

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:49.070
who was, she explains, the
very opposite of Frank Capra's

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:51.830
beloved George Bailey.

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:55.340
Echol's family wrapped
Davis, her mother's father,

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:56.960
in silence.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.180
When she began to
note that absence

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:02.210
and dig for what was
hidden in plain sight,

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:04.100
she stumbled on
a treasure trove,

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:08.150
not so unlike Teddy Hornes'
trunk, and also in the attic,

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:12.800
some 70 boxes of papers
stashed in her childhood home.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.470
As she sifted the
contents of those boxes

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:17.870
and continued the
sleuthing beyond them,

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:21.290
she recovered not only the
predatory lending and fraud

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:24.500
at the heart of her
grandfather's rise and fall,

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.980
but a fresh picture of
an era of boom and bust

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:30.230
and hollow gilded
fortunes, built

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:33.920
on the backs of ordinary
people, chasing their slices

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:37.430
of American home ownership.

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:40.700
Susan Faludi's family
secret went hunting for her,

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.070
rather than the
other way around.

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:45.800
In the summer of
2004, her father,

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:49.010
from whom she had been distant
for more than two decades,

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:53.510
sent her an email with
the subject line, Changes.

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:56.960
Stephen Faludi had been reborn
following gender transition

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.600
surgery as Stephanie.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:03.890
The revelation was shocking,
but not entirely surprising,

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:06.320
in that throughout
her childhood,

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.320
Faludi had experienced
her father as remote,

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.930
somehow invisible, she writes.

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:15.560
He seemed permanently
undercover.

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.960
Stephanie's gender
transition made

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:21.050
her visible to her
daughter, but it's only

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:23.930
in the course of Faludi's
marvelous excursion

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:29.090
into family and global history
that Stephanie becomes legible.

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:32.390
As a Jewish boy amidst the
trauma of central Europe

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:34.730
under the shadow
of the Holocaust,

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:39.110
as a volatile and unhappy man
amidst the gendered prison

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:43.310
of post-war American
suburbia, and finally

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:46.250
as an exuberant yet
not quite reliable

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:49.040
narrator in the
topsy turvy world

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.890
of post-communist Hungary.

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:55.670
Faludi, who's pioneering
long form journalism probed

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:57.950
the fruits of
feminism in Backlash:

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:01.760
The Undeclared War
Against American Women,

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.970
and the perils of modern
masculinity in Stiffed:

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:09.320
The Betrayal of American Men,
creates in, In the Dark Room,

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:12.890
an intimate epic of
identity and history, which

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:16.490
was a finalist for the
2016 Pulitzer Prize,

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:19.880
winner of the Kirkus Prize, and
one of the New York Times Book

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:24.680
reviews top 10 books last
year, and deservedly so.

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.780
Finally, Alex
Wagner will give us

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:31.550
a preview of her first book,
Futureface, a family mystery,

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:35.000
an epic quest, and a
search for belonging,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.440
which will be out next fall
from Random House's One World

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:39.980
Imprint.

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:42.020
Wagner will be
familiar to many of you

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:44.980
as a print, radio, and
television journalist.

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:48.650
Currently she appears as
a CBS News correspondent

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:52.610
and as the co-host of CBS
This Morning Saturday.

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:56.960
Before joining CBS, Wagner was
a senior editor at The Atlantic,

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.550
where her beat included
politics, culture,

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:02.450
and social trends, and where
she remains as a contributing

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:03.890
editor.

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:06.440
In her journalism and
in her advocacy work

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.200
against mass atrocities,
she had traveled

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.440
to various global
hotspots, including Burma,

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:15.980
whence her mother emigrated
to the United States.

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:18.110
The entwining of her
mother's and father's

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:21.260
families, and the
idea of bloodlines

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:25.910
as story and destiny, is
the subject of Futureface.

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:28.670
The title comes from a
Time Magazine article,

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:34.700
"the New Face of America," which
a very young Alex read in 1993.

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:39.890
The computer generated composite
face, a post-racial hybrid,

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:45.110
looked like her, she noticed,
as a sophomore in high school.

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:47.450
In the course of
analyzing her membership

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:51.110
in what she calls, the
polyglot tribe of all,

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:54.980
Wagner explores the stories
Americans tell themselves

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:56.510
about themselves--

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:59.420
stories of immigration
and integration

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:02.090
about who are our
people and what

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:04.970
makes them so, as she puts it.

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:07.310
Her journey into
Wagner family stories,

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:10.040
what she calls her
ancestor quest,

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:13.010
uncovers a variety
of embellishments,

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:16.160
suppressions, and outright lies.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.980
When she finds, as she writes,
a snag in the carefully

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:24.230
woven story on either side of
her family tree, she pulls it.

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:28.160
Doing so, she delves, not only
into her own family history,

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:33.020
but also into the nature of
the need to know who we are--

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:37.010
a search for identity that has
become as American as apple

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:41.690
pie, cutting across, as
Wagner writes, both red state

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:47.770
American exceptionalism and
blue state ethnic transcendence.

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:50.050
After Buckley, Echols,
Faludi, and Wagner

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:52.870
each introduce their
projects, Annette Gordon-Reed

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:56.800
will facilitate a
conversation across the panel.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.770
Gordon Reed, a Radcliffe
Institute Professor,

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:03.070
the Charles Warren Professor
of American Legal History--

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:05.050
hang on, cause she's
got a lot of titles--

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:08.140
at Harvard Law School, and
my colleague in the Harvard

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:11.530
History Department has won too
many honors and awards for me

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:14.079
to begin to name them here.

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:18.670
As a scholar over many books of
the relationship between Thomas

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:22.420
Jefferson and Sally Hemings,
and the impacts both

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:26.500
the white and black Jeffersons
have had on US history,

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.210
she investigates
the relationship

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:31.300
between black slavery
and white liberty, which

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:34.150
is arguably the
primal family secret

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:36.070
in all of American history.

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:38.432
Thank you.

00:17:38.432 --> 00:17:41.918
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:59.120 --> 00:17:59.620
OK.

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:03.760
We will proceed in
alphabetical order.

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.860
Everyone will take about
eight minutes, give or take.

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:09.640
And then we will have
questions-- well actually,

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.427
we will have questions
from me, and then

00:18:11.427 --> 00:18:12.760
we will have questions from you.

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:15.190
And please remember
to identify yourself

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:17.260
before you ask the questions.

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:20.200
So we will start with Gail.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.480
Hello.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:30.370
Before I start, I need to give
two sentimental disclosures.

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:33.920
The only A I ever got at Harvard
was from professor Schlesinger.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:34.736
[LAUGHING]

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:39.580
And he later on married one
of my best Radcliffe friends.

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:43.150
So I'm doubly honored
and happy to be here,

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:46.690
in support of the Radcliffe
Institute and the Schlesinger

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:48.760
Library.

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.430
Thank you.

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:54.220
When I was growing up
in the 1940s and '50s,

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:57.670
African-Americans had not
yet discovered Africa.

00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:00.700
Nor, more important, had they
discovered their true role

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:02.630
in American history.

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:05.980
They lived in a sort
of historical limbo,

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:09.310
because both histories were
too terrible to contemplate.

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:12.010
On the one hand, the slave
trade, on the other hand,

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:13.930
slavery itself.

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:17.950
From a sense of guilt, and a
wish to avoid the awful truth,

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:21.430
white America, in the
south in particular,

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:24.730
perpetuated the myth
of the happy slave.

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:26.800
Most Negroes, as
African-Americans

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:30.550
were then called, refused to
believe that the happy slave

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:32.980
ever existed.

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:36.080
What I discovered through
the black Calhouns however,

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.860
was that while there may not
have been many happy slaves,

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:43.890
there were, hidden in plain
sight, some lucky slaves.

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:47.410
As slavery went, the black
Calhouns' extended family

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:52.570
who centuries long story
I tell, from 1865 to 1964,

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:55.480
South and North, were
not exactly happy,

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.060
but they were certainly lucky.

00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:00.430
They were an intact family.

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:02.200
They could read and write.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.910
They'd been house slaves.

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:06.940
They had lived in a town,
not on a plantation,

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:10.120
and they had a rich and
quasi-benevolent owner.

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:14.230
They also benefited from a
secret, hidden in plain sight.

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:17.600
The photographs-- there's
a photograph of Moses,

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.560
yes, my great-great-grandfather,
taken some 20 years

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.230
after the war, about the
time that the Atlanta

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:25.960
Constitution called him,
the wealthiest colored

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.970
man in Atlanta.

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:29.710
And my great-grandparents--

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:32.500
Moses' eldest
daughter, Cora, aged

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.440
22 at the time of
her 1887 marriage

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:39.490
to Edwin Horne, who was
born free in Indiana.

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:42.790
Moses was lucky because his
owner, Dr. Andrew Bonaparte

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:46.420
Calhoun, important enough
to need a literate butler

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:50.230
had him educated, despite
laws to the contrary.

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:54.120
Dr. Calhoun, part owner of
Georgia's only gold mine,

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:57.460
and the first man to sign
George's Article of Secession,

00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:00.940
was a cousin of John C.
Calhoun, arch white supremacist

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:03.820
and slavery's most
famous apologist.

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:05.980
The black Calhouns had a
sort of family business

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:07.660
with the white Calhouns.

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:09.070
Moses was the Butler.

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:11.950
His mother was the cook, and his
sister, something of a beauty,

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:13.600
with the nursemaid.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:16.000
And Calhoun was a
benevolent owner.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.850
In 1870 he deeded
an acre of land

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:21.100
to Moses' mother and sister.

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:24.130
And therein lies a
typical antebellum secret.

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:27.850
The black Calhouns and the white
Calhouns are probably related.

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:30.310
No one knows for sure,
but the white Calhouns,

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:32.530
who I met in Atlanta
on my book tour,

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:35.080
believed it was true,
because the gift of land

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:39.700
was extraordinary for someone
who was merely a slave.

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:42.430
Moses waited until
he was free to marry.

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:45.340
In 1865, at the
age of 36, he found

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:48.940
a wife, who was 15 years
younger, came from New Orleans,

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:51.520
had always been free,
and looked white.

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:54.850
They had two beautiful
daughters, Cora and Lena.

00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:58.635
Possibly helped by Dr. Calhoun,
Moses opened a grocery store

00:21:58.635 --> 00:22:00.460
and catering establishment.

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:02.830
He later opened a
small boarding house.

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:06.790
Because he was educated, Moses
had a leg up in peace time.

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:09.490
More important,
war-torn Atlanta now

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:11.740
presented level playing
fields for whites

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:13.550
and some lucky blacks.

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:16.690
No one, white or black,
had much of anything.

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:18.950
Along with equality
of condition,

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:21.370
there was a new equality of law.

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:22.990
The new miracle
of Reconstruction

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:24.790
was made for Moses.

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:26.970
He registered as a
Republican voter,

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:29.500
opened an account in the
Freedman's Savings Bank,

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:32.230
whose last CEO was
Frederick Douglass,

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:35.560
and became a pillar of the
first Congregational Church.

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:38.530
He now saw that his
daughters were educated.

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:41.740
So-called missionary schools,
today's historically black

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:45.160
colleges, were created
throughout the old Confederacy

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.800
to train the first black
teachers in the south

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.950
after a century or more
of enforced illiteracy.

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:53.830
The modern Civil Rights Movement
began in these 19th century

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:57.400
schools, established by
northern white philanthropists,

00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:00.900
and staffed by northern white
who instilled confidence

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:04.320
as well as rigorous academics
into young people who

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.520
have been told for so long
that they were inferior beings,

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.440
and now were told
exactly the opposite.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.150
Atlanta had two important
missionary schools--

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:15.690
the Storrs School
for younger children,

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:18.910
and Atlanta University,
the Storrs' graduates.

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:21.930
The head of both schools was
a young Yale Divinity School

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:24.750
graduate named Asa
Ware who became

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:28.110
an abolitionist at the age of
15 after reading, Uncle Tom's

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:29.700
Cabin.

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:31.730
When asked how he could
live among blacks,

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:34.410
Ware explained that it was
easy because he was colorblind.

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:40.680
According to the Atlanta
Constitution in 1871,

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:43.830
the Storrs School [INAUDIBLE]
the extremely color-conscious

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:45.660
citizens of Atlanta.

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:49.260
To see colored boys and girls
reading in Greek and Latin,

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:51.120
and demonstrating
correctly, problems

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:54.060
in algebra and geometry,
and seemingly understanding

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:58.280
what they demonstrated,
appears almost wonderful.

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:02.820
When Ware died, age 48, after
20 years at Storrs in Atlanta,

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:06.420
his will stipulated that he
be buried in a black cemetery.

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:08.590
The city of Atlanta
denied his wish,

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:10.800
but compromised by
allowing him to be buried

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.540
in the middle of the
road that divided

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:16.950
the black and white
section of the cemetery.

00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:18.840
Cora Calhoun had
attended Atlanta,

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:20.550
but her younger
sister Lena left home

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:24.390
for another missionary college,
Fisk, in Nashville, Tennessee,

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:26.280
named for a Union general.

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:28.940
Lena's 17-year-old
classmate, Willie Du Bois

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:31.010
of Great Barrington,
Massachusetts,

00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:33.600
whose family had lived
free in the Berkshires

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:36.120
since colonial times,
fell hopelessly in love

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:39.060
with her, as W.E.B.
Du Bois later

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:43.400
wrote about the rosy apricot
beauty of Lena Calhoun.

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.457
Willie Du Bois had
been an all-around star

00:24:45.457 --> 00:24:47.040
at Great Barrington
high school, where

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:50.190
the only other black
students were his cousins.

00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:52.020
He had already been
accepted at Harvard,

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:55.530
but Harvard sent him to Fisk
for academic acclamation.

00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:58.740
Du Bois later said that he was
happy with Harvard's decision.

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:00.757
If he had gone to
Harvard first, he said,

00:25:00.757 --> 00:25:03.090
he might have tried to make
friends with white students,

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:05.500
and been hurt by their rebuffs.

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:08.220
He'd experienced no racism
in Great Barrington.

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:11.580
But after Fisk, he wrote, "a
new loyalty and allegiance

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:13.590
replaced my Americanism.

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:16.080
Henceforth I was a Negro."

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:18.740
Du Bois also gave the name
to his fellow missionary

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:22.410
schoolteachers to be, calling
them the talented 10th--

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:25.230
the 10% of the Negro
race, who were expected

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:28.800
to uplift the other 90%.

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.720
Edwin Horne, Cora
Calhoun's husband

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:33.690
became a success, partly
because of another secret

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:35.340
in plain sight.

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:36.900
His father was a
white Englishman,

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:39.180
and his mother was
a Native American.

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:41.220
Edwin chose to call
himself colored,

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:43.920
because in Indiana, whose
wartime governor was

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:48.690
an ardent abolitionist, it was
better to be black than Indian.

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:50.550
As a young colored
man, he stood out

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:52.740
as a teacher and
journalist, writing

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:56.280
for both the white and black
Evansville, Indiana papers.

00:25:56.280 --> 00:26:00.300
In 1875, the white
Evansville journal reported,

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:02.160
"at the close of the
written examination

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.260
of the second
intermediate schools,

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:06.420
it was discovered that
the pupils of the colored

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:09.480
school of that grade,
taught by Edwin F. Horne,

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:12.900
had the highest general
average in the city."

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:17.280
In 1881, Jim Crow, named for
an 1830's era minstrel song

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:19.500
was officially
born in Tennessee,

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.720
the birthplace of the KKK.

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:24.270
It was soon spread throughout
the south, the border states,

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:25.920
and much of the north.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:30.360
In 1883, Senator Charles
Sumner's great Civil Rights Act

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:34.230
of 1875, a cornerstone
of Reconstruction,

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:36.720
was declared unconstitutional.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.370
Black despair followed.

00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:42.210
By 1896, when the Supreme Court
decision, Plessy v. Ferguson

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:46.290
entrenched separate but
equal, Cora and Edwin Horne

00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:47.980
had moved to New York.

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:51.150
They would have four sons, two
born in the south and two born

00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:54.750
in the north, were Edwin, the
former colored Republican, now

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:57.150
known as the Adonis
of the Negro press,

00:26:57.150 --> 00:27:00.510
became a Democrat
and a Tammany man.

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:03.670
As an active member of
black Tammany in 1910,

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:05.500
Edwin ran for the
New York City Council

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:07.490
and lost on the Tammany ticket.

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:11.640
But Tammany rewarded him for
writing The 1910 pamphlet that

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:15.090
swayed the black
males in New York

00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:17.730
to elect a Democrat as
governor for the first time

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:19.480
since the Civil War.

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:22.584
1910 in New York saw
the black peril menace,

00:27:22.584 --> 00:27:24.000
in which blacks
were not permitted

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.520
to appear on Broadway,
although Bert

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.320
Williams, a black
superstar, was allowed

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:30.150
to appear in the
Ziegfeld Follies,

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:33.600
or to attend any midtown
theater or restaurant.

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:36.840
In 1912, the NAACP
successfully sued the city

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:38.940
to overthrow the
edict, which is clearly

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:40.650
more southern than northern.

00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:43.680
That same year, an editorial in
the Raleigh News and Observer

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:46.690
succinctly explained
the southern position.

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:48.630
"This objection of
the Negro politically

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:51.000
and the separation of
the Negro socially,

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.670
are paramount to all
considerations in the south,

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:57.880
short of the preservation
of the republic itself.

00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.040
Meanwhile, the family of
Moses Calhoun's sister

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:01.510
has stayed in the
south to become

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:03.640
pillars of black
Atlanta society,

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:05.590
and leaders of the community.

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:07.870
As principal of a black
school, Catherine's husband

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:11.440
was fired, refusing to let
his pupils march in a mandated

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.120
parade of
schoolchildren to honor

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:17.170
the remains of Jefferson Davis,
as they passed through Atlanta.

00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:18.700
But he had the
last laugh when he

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:21.830
became the first black licensed
real estate broker in Atlanta,

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:23.800
and a very wealthy man.

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.750
He had four daughters
and one son.

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:28.180
His youngest daughter
married a young captain

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:30.370
in a World War I
Medical Corps, who

00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:33.150
became the father and
grandfather of doctors,

00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:35.110
and when he died was
the longest practicing

00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:37.780
black doctor in Georgia,
and the longest practicing

00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:40.390
doctor of any race in Atlanta.

00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:43.010
In the north, Cora Horne
remained Republican.

00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:45.100
Influenced by
Tammany, however, she

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:46.930
made a quasi-death
bed conversion

00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:49.320
from congregationalism
to Catholicism,

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.460
when she was pregnant
with her fourth son,

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:53.930
and named him for the
priest who converted her.

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:57.190
Cora was a spiritual
seeker, and in her lifetime

00:28:57.190 --> 00:29:00.010
journeyed from
Congregationalism to Catholicism

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:03.220
to ethical culture
and finally to Bahai.

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:06.760
After her fourth child, Cora
discovered another secret.

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:08.860
Edwin had a white
mistress in Manhattan,

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:11.110
who shared his nightlife,
while Cora and the boys

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:12.860
were at home in Brooklyn.

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:16.230
Cora's revenge was to refuse
to speak to Edwin from then on.

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:19.420
They communicated via notes
passed by their youngest son,

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:22.060
and to throw herself
into activism.

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:23.590
At the time of her
death, Cora was

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:25.690
listed as having been an
active member or board

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:28.420
member of the following
organizations--

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:31.780
the YWCA, the Red Cross, the
Mayor's World War Victory

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:35.020
Committee, the NAACP, Urban
League, the Big Brother

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:36.940
and Big Sister
Organizations, where

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:39.580
she mentored young Paul
Robeson, the Brooklyn

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:42.580
Bureau of Charities, the
National Association of Colored

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:44.980
Women, the Brooklyn Urban
League, the New York

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:47.200
branch of the Women's
International League of Peace,

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.870
the Foreign Policy Association
of the International

00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:52.220
Council of Women of
the Darker Races,

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:55.480
founded in 1922 by
Women Corps among them,

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:59.140
from the US, Africa, Haiti,
the West Indies, and Ceylon.

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:01.174
In addition, she was
corresponding secretary

00:30:01.174 --> 00:30:03.590
of the Eastern Division of the
National Republican Women's

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:06.160
Auxiliary, and on the
National Speaker's Bureau

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:07.750
of the Republican Party.

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:11.440
Introducing activism
to the family in 1919,

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:14.290
she enrolled her granddaughter,
my mother, Lena Horne,

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:17.380
as a lifetime member of the
NAACP at the age of two.

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:18.310
[LAUGHING]

00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:22.300
I began this project
when my mother died,

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:24.430
and I found family papers
of the southern side

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:28.810
of the family, collected
by my Atlanta-based library

00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:31.890
genealogist cousin,
Catherine Nash Harris, who

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:33.490
did all the hard work.

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:35.260
I had the fun job of
putting the family

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:38.560
into historical perfection
and hunting down gossip.

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:40.390
Hidden in plain
sight in Atlanta was

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:42.580
a world I never knew existed.

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:45.640
A business culture rather than
a planter culture, Atlanta

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:48.290
never punished black
financial success.

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:50.290
Although politically
and socially oppressed,

00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:52.760
Atlanta's black middle
class nevertheless

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:55.390
led happy and successful
lives by looking

00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:59.110
inward to family, business,
schools, clubs, and church.

00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:01.760
Their northern counterparts
clearly had more choices,

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:06.190
but also more failed marriages,
more adultery, more alcoholism,

00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:07.720
et cetera.

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:10.510
The success, wealth, and
for want of a better term,

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:12.970
mental health at the
Atlanta black middle class

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:15.977
was both a secret and a
very pleasant surprise.

00:31:15.977 --> 00:31:18.060
Du Bois wrote that the
problem of the 20th century

00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:19.750
was a problem of the color line.

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:23.200
Clearly it will continue to be
a problem in the 21st century.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.200
But the story of the 20th
century black middle class

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:29.390
has lessons to teach about
fortitude and perseverance,

00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:33.832
in the secret corners of
race, sex and politics.

00:31:33.832 --> 00:31:34.820
Thank you.

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:38.772
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:45.370
OK.

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:47.940
I am here to talk
about this book.

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:49.570
It's just out on the New Press.

00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:53.110
It's called, Shortfall:
Family Secrets.

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:57.280
It's a huge subtitle,
probably inadvisedly so--

00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:59.110
Family Secrets,
Financial Collapse,

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:02.250
and a Hidden History of
American Banking This

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:07.460
is a book that exposes secret
histories of my family,

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:10.480
of the place they were from,
Colorado Springs, Colorado,

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:13.300
and of American capitalism.

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:17.650
Hidden in plain sight describes
all too well the secrets

00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:18.910
that I write about.

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:21.240
The very first
bits of my archive

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:24.460
emerge actually not from
those boxes in the attic,

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:27.340
although those certainly
featured later in it,

00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:31.300
but from a very beautiful
but very battered

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:35.560
Louis Vuitton trunk, that
sat in my family's rec room,

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:38.960
closed but unlocked,
for nearly 50 years.

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:41.140
And I used to spend tons
of time in that rec room,

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:43.392
and I never opened it.

00:32:43.392 --> 00:32:45.650
Ah.

00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:47.950
And when it comes to
the financial history

00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:50.620
that I chronicle here,
which is the cratering

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:52.150
of our country's
building and loan

00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:54.860
industry-- a very important
industry, by the way,

00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:58.870
during the depression-- that
too was hiding in plain sight.

00:32:58.870 --> 00:33:02.500
One can find mention of it and
the fraud that sometimes caused

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:06.130
the failure of individual
building and loans or BNLs

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:07.900
as I will be calling them here.

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:10.840
Indeed, I found, I think,
the very first reference

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:16.330
to such failures in Elizabeth
Cohen's, Making a New Deal.

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:18.670
But the secondary literature
on the thrift industry

00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:22.060
generally boasts of its
remarkable resilience,

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:24.880
in fact its goodness
during these years.

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:28.360
One scholar calls them,
banks with a soul.

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:32.290
And the idea that fraud was in
any way associated with them

00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:37.450
really seems unthinkable
in these texts.

00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:41.715
Now Shortfall uses the failure
of the BNL industry, a history

00:33:41.715 --> 00:33:46.510
it tells in microcosm through
the firestorm that enveloped

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:48.820
Colorado Springs,
in order to think

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:51.820
about the relationship between
property, class, and politics

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:54.760
in America, and with, I
think a lot of relevance

00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:56.740
to today's America.

00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:58.750
You could say that
the book exposes

00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:01.180
the underbelly of
American capitalism,

00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:05.980
as I sometimes have, but
that suggests something

00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:10.120
more discreet, more delimited
than the bloated underbelly

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:11.770
I discovered.

00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:16.840
I often wondered, as I
researched this history,

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:21.610
that it really I think captures
quite nicely, the space where

00:34:21.610 --> 00:34:25.300
dreams and scams commingled.

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:28.030
Where does the underbelly end?

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:31.750
And I can tell you, it extended
all the way to Main Street.

00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:34.060
And this is not the
way I know that it's

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:35.320
meant to be in America.

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:39.880
In America, Main Street
exists as a kind of refuge

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.500
from bad capitalism.

00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:46.239
Case in point go back to
the Democratic primaries

00:34:46.239 --> 00:34:49.750
and the ways in which Sanders
and Clinton would answer

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:52.690
questions about capitalism.

00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:56.080
Now it's this fairy tale version
of Main Street capitalism

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:59.470
as a site of honesty,
transparency, and fairness that

00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:05.530
animates Frank Capra's 1946
film, It's a Wonderful Life.

00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:09.430
And, you know, this is an
iconic image from that movie.

00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:11.930
How many of you have
seen this movie?

00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:12.430
OK.

00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:13.920
Many, many, many.

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:16.000
All through the 70s and
80s because it fell out

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.930
of copyright.

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:21.850
And here, this is an image in
which the selfless BNL operator

00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:24.670
George Bailey,
beleaguered as well,

00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:28.830
and his long suffering, even
more beleaguered wife, Mary,

00:35:28.830 --> 00:35:30.910
are putting an end
to a bank run that's

00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:34.360
been engineered by the
town's fat cat banker,

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:38.607
by distributing their
very own honeymoon money.

00:35:38.607 --> 00:35:39.940
But here we have another couple.

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:42.010
This is Walter and
Lula Davis, and they

00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:44.770
were my maternal grandparents.

00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:47.530
And I think it's fair to say
that my grandparents would not

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:50.660
have distributed their honeymoon
money to distressed depositors.

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:52.100
[LAUGHING]

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:55.330
Even to stop a bank run.

00:35:55.330 --> 00:35:58.480
Walter Davis became briefly
famous across the country

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:00.700
as a bankster, as in gangster.

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:04.090
It was a fairly
typical nomenclature

00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:06.430
in the Depression years
when the banksters

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:09.620
were really reviled and hated.

00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:12.670
He went on the lam in 1932,
just before the authorities

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:14.950
discovered that his
building and loan had

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:18.670
suffered a shocking
$1.25 million shortfall.

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:22.120
That's nearly $22 million
in today's dollars.

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:28.840
Now, one big challenge in
writing this book for me--

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:29.800
and there were many--

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:32.590
was figuring out what
made these people tick.

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:34.930
That meant grappling with
the class consciousness

00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:38.350
of my maternal grandmother, a
young woman looking for any way

00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:40.330
to escape where
she had come from,

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:43.390
a sodden, tubercular
hollow, where she lived

00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:44.860
with her parents and older--

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:46.030
I know it's a bit over--

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:47.530
[LAUGHING]

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:52.120
And older brothers, all of
them working backbreaking jobs,

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:53.110
which was true.

00:36:53.110 --> 00:36:54.430
And all of them--

00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:58.120
I mean, when I discovered this,
it was quite a discovery--

00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:00.160
all of them dead by
the time she was 10.

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:02.631
She was orphaned
at the age of 10.

00:37:02.631 --> 00:37:04.130
And you know, you
look at this woman

00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:07.180
and you wouldn't think
that that was her past.

00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:09.790
And also I wanted to
understand the consciousness

00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:11.950
of my grandfather, a
son of a barber who

00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:15.340
hoped he could reinvent
himself as a lawyer in Colorado

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:18.250
Springs-- even printed up
cards that called himself

00:37:18.250 --> 00:37:21.340
a lawyer, when he moved, to have
them on the ready when he moved

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:24.370
to Colorado, and
ended up a loan shark,

00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:28.090
before successfully deploying
that particular business

00:37:28.090 --> 00:37:31.420
model in the BNL industry.

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:34.570
And then also my mother,
who at the end of her life

00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:38.800
described her family to me as
nobodies, come from nowhere.

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:41.530
And she included
herself in that.

00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:44.440
And she also said,
not from good stock.

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:46.720
That was the phrase used.

00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:50.590
So for me, class,
how it works on us,

00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:53.980
how we work it, as
we push its levers,

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:56.350
to paraphrase Barbara
and Karen Fields,

00:37:56.350 --> 00:37:57.970
that's the kind of
spine of the book.

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:05.620
And in a certain way,
one of the reasons

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:08.380
that I was interested in
doing this kind of a book

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:10.990
and in exploring this kind
of class consciousness

00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:13.180
is that I'd been
very affected by some

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:17.380
of the scholarship of the
British working classes

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:21.880
that one might associate
with Caroline Steedman, Seth

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:26.350
Koven, and others.

00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:28.930
And it's a kind of
class consciousness

00:38:28.930 --> 00:38:31.090
that US historians,
particularly of the '30s,

00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:33.400
haven't lingered on,
shall we say, because

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:36.340
of the preferences for
heroic collectivist,

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:40.180
solidarity forever kind
of class consciousness.

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:41.920
Now Shortfall is
a braided history.

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:46.690
And its most central
braid is the BNL industry.

00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:49.570
As I said, this was an
industry that was once really

00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:53.530
a key important part of
America's financial landscape.

00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:55.000
It was a vehicle--

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.850
it was meant to be-- for
working class home ownership.

00:38:57.850 --> 00:39:01.090
These BNLs were originally
known as poor man's banks.

00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:03.070
But by the '20s they
were increasingly

00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:08.560
being taken over by unscrupulous
characters like my grandfather.

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:12.700
And the consequences ultimately
when the Depression hit

00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:16.420
were really quite calamitous.

00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:19.830
And I spent a lot of time in
the book documenting this.

00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:22.780
Now property looms very
large in Shortfall.

00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:27.040
And I think my book reveals,
as does the subprime mortgage

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:31.660
crisis in the Great Recession
of our own time, that owning

00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:36.760
property can in fact be one's
undoing as well as ones making.

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:38.350
Certainly for the
working classes,

00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:41.080
home ownership became a
much riskier proposition

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:43.660
with this new BNL
business model.

00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:46.670
Something else may
have happened as well,

00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:50.050
which is that I think--

00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:51.850
and I go out on a
limb a bit here--

00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:55.150
buying a house
was, I think, less

00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:57.640
likely to be a community
endeavor supported

00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:00.760
by one's neighbors, as it
had been when BNLs were part

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:03.100
of the fabric of the country's
co-operative movement

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:04.510
in the 19th century.

00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:07.570
And it became much more of
an individual achievement,

00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:09.490
and one that in
certain circumstances

00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:13.240
may have oriented homeowners
politically to the right.

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:15.700
This shift may
help explain how it

00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:18.940
is that so many ordinary
Americans, including Americans

00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:22.210
of the white working classes
came to embrace self-reliance,

00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:24.790
which I think over time
became racially coded,

00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:26.650
and to look skeptically
upon government

00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:29.380
programs as a solution
to social problems.

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:30.970
I found this in
Colorado Springs.

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:34.630
When BNL depositors, pissed
off about being defrauded,

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:36.130
organized.

00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:38.290
But they organized in
a very interesting way.

00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:42.280
They were led by leaders of a
local tax limitation movement.

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:44.380
And the similarities
that I discovered

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:46.960
between the taxpayers
associations of the Great

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:49.210
Depression-- and these
are very under-studied.

00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:51.100
They're worthy of
much more study--

00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:53.370
and the Tea Party of
our own Great Recession.

00:40:53.370 --> 00:40:54.940
It was really quite striking.

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:58.150
A tax on government and its
bureaucrats for subsidizing,

00:40:58.150 --> 00:41:01.330
"losers," antipathy
to regulation, faith

00:41:01.330 --> 00:41:03.670
and self-reliance
and free enterprise,

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:06.280
and the politics of
aggrievement that really

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:10.330
fueled both of these movements.

00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:12.910
Over the past year,
people have puzzled over

00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:16.300
why even ordinary Americans
are so tax averse,

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:18.520
and why conservatism
appeals to some

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:20.440
among the white working classes.

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:22.210
I'll tell you, this
doesn't surprise me

00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:26.250
because I've spent a long
time now studying what

00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:28.950
happened in the '20s and '30s.

00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:32.700
And let's just say this has
been a long time in the making.

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:35.160
Ultimately,
Shortfall asks why it

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:41.100
is that we are so forgiving of
capitalism, and so unforgiving

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:43.650
of those who fall
behind, or who,

00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:45.960
by virtue of
systemic inequality,

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:47.460
have always been behind.

00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:48.848
Thank you.

00:41:48.848 --> 00:41:52.800
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:02.300
Thank you so much.

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:05.360
It's really great to
be back at Radcliffe,

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:12.320
and to be a part of this
incredible group of writers.

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:17.810
I actually started writing this
book here, kind of on the QT,

00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:19.580
while I was on a
Radcliffe fellowship.

00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:22.700
I was supposed to be
working on something else.

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:26.840
But that's how it
works at Radcliffe.

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:31.250
So to be invited back
to talk about it,

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:33.380
feels like a sentimental return.

00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:40.370
This is a book I
couldn't not write.

00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:43.910
It's about a part of my
life that was, indeed,

00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:48.750
hidden in plain
sight, even for me,

00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:50.800
Which is why I had to write it.

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:55.340
I couldn't go forward honestly
with my public feminism

00:42:55.340 --> 00:43:02.110
without coming to grips with
this event in my private life.

00:43:02.110 --> 00:43:06.410
But writing it also helped me
grapple with some big questions

00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:09.260
about gender and
identity that are

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:12.830
roiling in our current
political landscape.

00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:16.010
So in my eight minutes,
I want to tell you first

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:18.800
about my father's
transformation and how

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:23.330
that played out for her and in
our complicated relationship.

00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:27.110
But I also want to touch
on a larger political drama

00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:30.530
that was going on in the time
I was visiting my father,

00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:33.560
which is highly
relevant, unfortunately,

00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:35.630
to the present moment
in this country.

00:43:38.250 --> 00:43:43.250
So as Jane pointed out, I
was sitting at home in 2004,

00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:44.450
minding my own business.

00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:48.290
Actually I was sorting
through notes on my last book

00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:52.610
about the masculinity
crisis, when I received

00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:55.630
this email from my father.

00:43:55.630 --> 00:43:59.150
And it began, "Dear,
Susan, I've got

00:43:59.150 --> 00:44:01.520
some interesting news for you.

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:03.830
I have decided that
I have had enough

00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:07.310
of impersonating a macho
aggressive man that I've never

00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:09.420
been inside."

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:12.420
Well this interesting
news, illustrated

00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:15.190
with several
attached selfies, was

00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:19.290
that my father, without
telling anyone in the family,

00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:23.700
had flown all alone to Thailand
to have gender reassignment

00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:25.740
surgery.

00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:27.760
To make matters
more complicated,

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:32.100
my father at the time
was 76-years-old,

00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:34.320
and we had been estranged.

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:36.870
My father and I
had barely spoken

00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:39.540
in more than a quarter century.

00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:41.710
That was because when
I was growing up,

00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:47.220
my father was indeed a,
"macho aggressive" man, also

00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:52.740
autocratic, domineering,
bullying, and violent,

00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:57.040
all of which fueled
my early feminism.

00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:59.740
Well, a couple of
months after that email,

00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:04.240
and at the invitation of my
father to write about her,

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:06.860
I got on a plane
to Hungary, which

00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:11.140
was where my father was
living, because in 1990,

00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:16.182
my father had returned to the
country where she had grown up.

00:45:16.182 --> 00:45:17.640
And by the way, if
you're wondering

00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:20.970
why I'm saying my father
instead of my parent,

00:45:20.970 --> 00:45:23.760
it's because that's
what she wanted.

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:26.690
I'm still your father, you
know, she liked to say to me.

00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:34.100
Well, that first visit was a
real life test of my feminism.

00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:38.014
And believe me, the ironies
were not lost on me.

00:45:38.014 --> 00:45:43.430
You know, here is my father
whose patriarchal belligerence

00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:46.130
really sparked my
feminist fervor,

00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:50.120
who was going on about
Maybelline lip gloss,

00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:55.190
giving me the grand tour of
her Marilyn Monroe wardrobe,

00:45:55.190 --> 00:46:00.020
and singing the
praises of housewifery.

00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:03.000
"You write about the
disadvantages of being a woman,

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.320
she told me, but I've
only found advantages."

00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:11.080
And yet, as she
settled into herself,

00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:15.880
she dropped the caricature
persona of vavoom vamp

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:19.390
and hausfrau, and
over time she became

00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:21.910
more comfortable
with who she was,

00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:25.690
which was a person much
more complex and interesting

00:46:25.690 --> 00:46:31.630
than the cardboard cutout that
she had originally promoted.

00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:34.570
Which is one reason
why I love this photo.

00:46:34.570 --> 00:46:40.200
It's from 2010, and of the
two of us on the old siklo.

00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:44.230
It was this cute
little incline train

00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:47.230
that goes up to the top
of Castle Hill, which

00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:49.510
my father had many
happy memories

00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:53.640
about this little train.

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:57.190
But because she-- as you
can see, she's just--

00:46:57.190 --> 00:47:01.120
she's not wearing any
of the fancy stuff,

00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:03.055
and is just comfortable
with herself.

00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:09.930
And I also came
to see, over time,

00:47:09.930 --> 00:47:16.180
how she and I, in many ways,
were on a similar path, each

00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:21.200
struggling to free ourselves
from the constraints of gender.

00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:26.100
So in the end, my
father's transformation

00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:29.350
affirmed my bedrock
feminist belief

00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:32.080
that gender is
infinitely varied,

00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:36.130
that we are all much
more than the sex roles

00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:40.050
that society imposes on us.

00:47:40.050 --> 00:47:46.140
My father wanted me to chronicle
only her new gender identity.

00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:49.620
Anything from the past she
dismissed as, "irrelevant"

00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:53.310
and, quote, "ancient history."

00:47:53.310 --> 00:47:58.290
But her gender life was
inextricably tied to her past,

00:47:58.290 --> 00:48:01.980
and in particular to her
religious and political

00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:04.690
past experience.

00:48:04.690 --> 00:48:09.630
My father grew up Istvan
Friedman, an only child

00:48:09.630 --> 00:48:12.810
of wealthy Jewish
parents in Budapest,

00:48:12.810 --> 00:48:15.840
and lived a life of
privilege until World War

00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:18.600
II, when large
numbers of our family

00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:21.480
would perish in the Holocaust.

00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:25.890
And this is a photo of my great
grandparent's 50th wedding

00:48:25.890 --> 00:48:30.750
anniversary in 1943,
their Golden Jubilee.

00:48:30.750 --> 00:48:35.220
Six months later, all but three
of the people in this picture

00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:38.160
were murdered.

00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:41.490
My teenage father
survived-- by the way,

00:48:41.490 --> 00:48:48.120
my father is right
there on the top row.

00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:50.970
My father survived as
an urchin on the streets

00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:53.580
in Budapest, passing
as a Christian

00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:58.740
with false identity papers
and a stolen fascist armband.

00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:01.080
One time my father
used that armband

00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:06.510
to impersonate a Hungarian
Nazi Arrow Cross office,

00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:11.370
so as to rescue my grandparents
from a, quote unquote,

00:49:11.370 --> 00:49:15.390
protected house, whose residents
were about to be taken down

00:49:15.390 --> 00:49:18.180
to the Danube and shot
into the river, which

00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:21.600
was a fate for thousands
of Budapest's Jews

00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:25.080
in the winter of 1944.

00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:28.560
After the war, my father
went on to other identity

00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:30.390
reinventions--

00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:35.790
swashbuckling filmmaker
in the Brazilian outback,

00:49:35.790 --> 00:49:40.950
alpine mountaineer an ice
climber, All-American commuter

00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:45.330
dad in Westchester County,
and high-end commercial

00:49:45.330 --> 00:49:51.300
photographer in Manhattan, whose
specialty was altering images.

00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:58.380
People often see identity
as singular and stable.

00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:00.720
But what I saw with my
father was an identity

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:04.410
that was multiple and fluid,
and had many threads that

00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:07.380
were tangled in her mind.

00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:09.780
As much as she
tried to seal away

00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:12.840
the past, when she talked
to me about her gender

00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:15.570
transformation, she
inevitably would

00:50:15.570 --> 00:50:20.060
return to her Holocaust trauma.

00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:23.820
Now, as I visited my father,
I found myself caught up

00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:26.940
in another identity drama.

00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:31.440
Hungary was undergoing
its own identity crisis,

00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:36.120
one that would lead it to the
brink of a neo-fascist state.

00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:40.440
I first encountered that crisis
when I was nearly mowed down

00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:44.640
on the street in Budapest
by a militia of men

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:49.440
in black uniforms with
four red on white stripes.

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:52.530
This was the Magyar
Guard, which was then

00:50:52.530 --> 00:50:56.670
the paramilitary wing of the
far right Jobbik Party, which

00:50:56.670 --> 00:51:00.330
was openly advocating throwing
Jews out of the country

00:51:00.330 --> 00:51:05.910
and rounding up Roma in, quote
unquote, detention camps.

00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:09.900
The militiamen would go on to
terrorize Roma communities,

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:15.900
beat up Jewish worshippers, and
desecrate Holocaust memorials.

00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:18.900
That four-stripe
insignia, by the way,

00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:24.466
is a near replica of the 1940s
Hungarian Nazi Arrow Cross

00:51:24.466 --> 00:51:24.965
insignia.

00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:29.920
Well two years after
that encounter,

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:35.500
the rightest Fidesz Party swept
into power in 2010 elections,

00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:41.500
by showcasing this confabulated
Magyar identity of martyred

00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:43.610
and chest-beating nationalism--

00:51:43.610 --> 00:51:48.730
a sort of, Make Hungary
Great Again campaign.

00:51:48.730 --> 00:51:52.420
The new government quickly
undermined the independence

00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:55.660
of the courts, the central
bank, and the media.

00:51:55.660 --> 00:51:59.710
It rewrote the Constitution
to curtail civil liberties

00:51:59.710 --> 00:52:03.400
and declare Hungary
a Christian nation.

00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:07.630
And, oh yeah, built
a razor wire wall

00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:10.825
along Hungary's southern
border to keep out refugees.

00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:17.940
Let me just end with this
quick thought that part of what

00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:21.030
my book explores is
the Janus-faced nature

00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:22.170
of identity--

00:52:22.170 --> 00:52:25.410
the way that identity
can be either liberating,

00:52:25.410 --> 00:52:30.180
as with LGBT rights, civil
rights, or feminism, or it

00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:33.860
can be nationalistic
and xenophobic.

00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:39.620
The first identity search seeks
self-awareness, understanding,

00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:41.390
self-discovery.

00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:45.290
The second is an attempt to
paper over painful realities

00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:50.640
by retreating into a fantasy
identity based on scapegoating,

00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:55.730
self-pity, and the embrace of
an authoritarian strongman,

00:52:55.730 --> 00:52:58.850
all of which probably
sounds pretty familiar.

00:52:58.850 --> 00:53:01.270
Thank you.

00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:04.658
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:12.140
- In the interest
of time, I'm going

00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:15.350
to try and keep this succinct
SO we can get to the discussion.

00:53:15.350 --> 00:53:17.300
And I'm going to stay
right here to do that.

00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:18.530
OK.

00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:22.370
If I could get the
first slide up.

00:53:22.370 --> 00:53:24.650
I'm Alex Wagner.

00:53:24.650 --> 00:53:28.520
I am the only child of a
Burmese-American union that

00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:33.650
began, and for that matter ended
in Washington D.C. Growing up,

00:53:33.650 --> 00:53:38.970
I was acutely aware of my
mother's family history.

00:53:38.970 --> 00:53:42.560
This is my mother and
my grandmother in 1964,

00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:46.650
on their way to America,
leaving Burma for the last time.

00:53:46.650 --> 00:53:48.950
And my mom is the one
obviously on the left,

00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:53.630
trying to do her best
Jackie Kennedy impression.

00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:57.620
I was told growing up, a series
of incredibly romantic stories

00:53:57.620 --> 00:54:00.860
about life in Burma,
that our family had lived

00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:04.190
this incredibly cosmopolitan
life, that everyone was well

00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:07.700
educated, that we had one of
the first Dodge motor cars

00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:12.260
in Rangoon, that my
great aunts were educated

00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:15.350
in university, which was
a fairly progressive thing

00:54:15.350 --> 00:54:17.660
in 1930s Burma.

00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:21.680
There were constant references
to leaders in Africa

00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:28.730
or great works of English
literature or exotic foodstuffs

00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:31.490
that you wouldn't normally
find in a Burmese household.

00:54:31.490 --> 00:54:34.370
This was all evidence
of how special we were.

00:54:34.370 --> 00:54:37.820
And I grew up
believing all of it.

00:54:37.820 --> 00:54:41.210
My mother and my uncle
and my grandmother

00:54:41.210 --> 00:54:44.840
fled the country in the early
1960s to come to America,

00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:47.240
and I'm told they
never looked back.

00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:49.670
My grandmother worked at
the Library of Congress

00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:52.010
in the East Asian
Books Department.

00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:55.340
My grandfather adapted
frighteningly quickly

00:54:55.340 --> 00:54:59.390
to suburban American
life and ate chard steaks

00:54:59.390 --> 00:55:03.770
and worked on his car
and became an American,

00:55:03.770 --> 00:55:05.060
for all intents and purposes.

00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:08.450
My mother, who was college-aged,
went to Swarthmore,

00:55:08.450 --> 00:55:11.090
where she got a full
scholarship and became enamored

00:55:11.090 --> 00:55:15.470
of left wing politics as one
would in the 1960s and '70s,

00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:18.290
and eventually moved
to Washington D.C.,

00:55:18.290 --> 00:55:20.600
where she met my father.

00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:23.450
They were both
organizing labor unions,

00:55:23.450 --> 00:55:28.460
as one did in the late 1960s
and '70s in Washington D.C.

00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:32.030
In many ways my mother's story
was the quintessential story

00:55:32.030 --> 00:55:35.450
of 20th century
migration-- men and women

00:55:35.450 --> 00:55:38.360
fleeing political
persecution, coming

00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:40.370
to America to seek freedom.

00:55:40.370 --> 00:55:42.140
On the other side
was my dad's family.

00:55:42.140 --> 00:55:45.260
That's my dad, the smaller
of the two brothers.

00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:49.880
He grew up in Northeastern
Iowa in a tiny town

00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:53.300
on the Mississippi River
called Lansing, Iowa.

00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:56.150
And in many ways, his story
was the quintessential story

00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:58.550
of late 19th
century immigration.

00:55:58.550 --> 00:56:00.740
His people had come
from western Europe,

00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:02.990
seeking greater or at
least better fortunes

00:56:02.990 --> 00:56:04.820
here in the West.

00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:08.030
His grandfather, a man named
Henry Wagner, or at least

00:56:08.030 --> 00:56:10.280
we thought his name was Henry
Wagner, but more on that

00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:10.850
later--

00:56:10.850 --> 00:56:14.750
he moved here from the tiny
town of Esch-Sur-Alzette

00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:15.800
in Luxembourg.

00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:19.070
I had no idea where that was,
and I didn't particularly

00:56:19.070 --> 00:56:19.850
care growing up.

00:56:19.850 --> 00:56:24.230
I just knew it was cool to
have ancestors from Luxembourg.

00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:26.300
They somehow ended
up in Lansing,

00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:29.960
and he became the proprietor
of a local saloon and grocery,

00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:32.360
and had 14 children--

00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:35.300
a Catholic boy done good.

00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:38.190
These were the divergent
branches of my family tree,

00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:40.790
and I was raised with them
in the back of my mind.

00:56:40.790 --> 00:56:43.190
They were pleasant
boughs to hang from,

00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:44.700
but not much more than that.

00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:47.090
And if anybody asked,
I couldn't tell anybody

00:56:47.090 --> 00:56:50.030
more than the general outlines
that I was a Luxembourgian

00:56:50.030 --> 00:56:54.380
Burmese, and that
seemed to be enough.

00:56:54.380 --> 00:56:56.360
As a mixed race
Asian American, I

00:56:56.360 --> 00:57:02.890
took pride in the exoticism
of those lineages.

00:57:02.890 --> 00:57:05.840
No one in Washington D.C. Or
anywhere on the planet as far

00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:08.600
as I could tell, could boast
of Burmese-Luxembourgian

00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:10.460
bloodlines.

00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:11.330
But that was it.

00:57:11.330 --> 00:57:13.640
I didn't really know much
more about Burmese life

00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:15.410
before my family had left.

00:57:15.410 --> 00:57:18.230
I didn't really know
much about Henry Wagner

00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:20.760
and what had pushed him west.

00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:23.870
Instead, in the late
'90s and early 2000s,

00:57:23.870 --> 00:57:26.420
as I came into adulthood
and left adolescence,

00:57:26.420 --> 00:57:32.000
I took pride in being vaguely
indiscriminately brownish.

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:36.290
And as Jane so eloquently
summarized in her intro--

00:57:36.290 --> 00:57:39.050
you did a much better job than
I ever could with my book.

00:57:39.050 --> 00:57:43.130
When Time Magazine ran that 1993
magazine cover-- incidentally,

00:57:43.130 --> 00:57:45.110
it's amazing how
many people remember

00:57:45.110 --> 00:57:48.800
that Time Magazine
cover, right, proclaiming

00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:53.120
the new face of America, the
future face, if you will,

00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:57.140
the person on the cover looked
equally indiscriminately

00:57:57.140 --> 00:57:59.180
brownish, just like me.

00:57:59.180 --> 00:58:03.530
So future face was me,
and I was future face.

00:58:03.530 --> 00:58:05.940
That would be the
posture I adopted

00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:08.900
for much of my late adolescence
and early adulthood.

00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:14.330
I was indiscriminately brown
and was that not fantastic?

00:58:14.330 --> 00:58:17.170
The not knowingness of it all.

00:58:17.170 --> 00:58:19.510
I was like some
kind of exotic bird

00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:21.760
that had flown in
from overseas--

00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:27.290
a toucan in Washington D.C.,
a flamingo in New York City.

00:58:27.290 --> 00:58:27.790
But

00:58:27.790 --> 00:58:30.160
As as grew up, and
as I grew older,

00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:33.270
and as circumstances and
politics around me changed,

00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:36.460
this not knowing and this
embrace of the general

00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:39.970
gave way to a desire
for the specific,

00:58:39.970 --> 00:58:43.210
for a tribe, for
a place to belong,

00:58:43.210 --> 00:58:45.610
a feeling of
loneliness that wasn't

00:58:45.610 --> 00:58:49.480
going to be satisfied with
friendship or collegiality.

00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:53.860
I wanted to know
who my people were.

00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:55.810
And I think a lot
of Americans want

00:58:55.810 --> 00:58:57.370
to know who their
people are, which

00:58:57.370 --> 00:59:02.320
is why we are seeing a boom in
the ancestor search industry

00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:04.560
to the tune of $1 billion.

00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:08.170
My book is about a
quest to find my people.

00:59:08.170 --> 00:59:10.916
I won't give away the endings,
because really the mystery

00:59:10.916 --> 00:59:12.540
is what's going to
sell you guys on it.

00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:16.090
But basically I
interviewed family members,

00:59:16.090 --> 00:59:19.030
from whom I'd been
estranged in many cases.

00:59:19.030 --> 00:59:21.880
I unraveled a series
of family mysteries.

00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:24.340
I traveled back to
ancestral homelands

00:59:24.340 --> 00:59:28.660
and got very familiar with
Esch-Sur-Alzette and Rangoon,

00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:29.560
Burma.

00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:32.500
I went on several
wild goose chases.

00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:37.180
I took many, many
DNA-based ancestry tests.

00:59:37.180 --> 00:59:41.470
I had family members take many,
many ancestry-based DNA tests.

00:59:41.470 --> 00:59:44.590
I spoke with
Luxembourgian genealogists

00:59:44.590 --> 00:59:48.490
and Burmese archivists, and
I pissed a lot of people

00:59:48.490 --> 00:59:50.980
off in the process.

00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:53.260
Really what I found
is that much of what

00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:55.780
we've been telling
ourselves about who we are,

00:59:55.780 --> 00:59:58.180
and who we were, are lies.

00:59:58.180 --> 01:00:01.780
And that the construct
of one's people

01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:05.260
is not really what
we think it is.

01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:09.970
I embarked on this
voyage not solely

01:00:09.970 --> 01:00:12.190
to get at the truth
of who my family was,

01:00:12.190 --> 01:00:15.460
but also to better understand
the immigrant story,

01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:19.960
to unpack that well-worn
narrative of coming to America.

01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:22.520
Coming to America, not as
in the Eddie Murphy story,

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:26.050
although I suppose that movie
is also relevant to this.

01:00:26.050 --> 01:00:29.950
The idea of leaving one place
and starting a new in another

01:00:29.950 --> 01:00:33.430
is mostly recounted using
a very gauzy filter.

01:00:33.430 --> 01:00:35.890
That the Old World
was left behind

01:00:35.890 --> 01:00:40.180
and the New World beckoned us
with freedom and opportunity.

01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:45.550
But in reality, immigration
is hard and it is complicated

01:00:45.550 --> 01:00:48.790
and it is full of
terrible, terrible choices,

01:00:48.790 --> 01:00:50.890
and broken hearts.

01:00:50.890 --> 01:00:54.700
And in reality, the place that
we left behind, very often

01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:59.670
has quite a bit in common with
the place where we arrived.

01:00:59.670 --> 01:01:03.940
Today there is a furious debate
in the public sphere over who

01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:06.520
is American and who is not.

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:10.180
Blood and soil
nationalism is resurgent.

01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:14.320
So what better time to
re-examine one's own blood

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:18.490
and step foot on one's own
soil, and examine the stories

01:01:18.490 --> 01:01:20.890
we have spun for decades,
if not centuries,

01:01:20.890 --> 01:01:25.760
about what makes us decidedly
American and of this place.

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:27.430
That's my book.

01:01:27.430 --> 01:01:30.370
[APPLAUSE]

01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:31.840
- OK.

01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:40.220
So we'll do some questions,
and then we'll get to you guys

01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:41.179
as quickly as possible.

01:01:41.179 --> 01:01:43.219
But I wanted to ask--
because I would never think

01:01:43.219 --> 01:01:44.540
about writing about my family.

01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:46.810
I write about other
people's families--

01:01:46.810 --> 01:01:49.640
people dead long ago.

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:53.120
Susan, I understand you
said that you felt that you

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:56.450
had to write this story.

01:01:56.450 --> 01:01:58.430
Why did you have to
write this story?

01:01:58.430 --> 01:02:00.020
And I'll ask the
other people as well.

01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:03.190
Did you feel that you had
to write your stories?

01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:05.598
You can go first.

01:02:05.598 --> 01:02:07.692
- Can you hear me?

01:02:07.692 --> 01:02:09.650
- What would have happened
if you didn't do it?

01:02:09.650 --> 01:02:14.030
- Well, you know, I
tried many years not to.

01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:22.580
I kept going over to Hungary,
doing this sort of half,

01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:26.900
I wouldn't say charade, but
I had all of my notebooks

01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:32.540
and tapes and was going through
the show of interviewing

01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:36.550
my father for this book
that she wanted me to write.

01:02:36.550 --> 01:02:43.550
But for many years, it was
about our reconnection.

01:02:43.550 --> 01:02:45.230
And that the way we could--

01:02:45.230 --> 01:02:47.150
really the only way
we could reconnect

01:02:47.150 --> 01:02:51.500
was through my interviewing her.

01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:55.430
And we, over time sort of
developed a relationship

01:02:55.430 --> 01:03:00.410
that we hadn't had in more
than a quarter century.

01:03:00.410 --> 01:03:02.840
So for a long time I thought
that's what I was just

01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:06.215
sort of working out,
reconciling to the degree one

01:03:06.215 --> 01:03:12.680
ever reconciles with one's
parents, through this process.

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:20.930
But at the same time,
I could see how,

01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:24.600
to be writing as a
feminist in this era,

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:30.290
and particularly as,
thankfully, trans questions

01:03:30.290 --> 01:03:33.110
came to the mainstream,
that I needed

01:03:33.110 --> 01:03:35.810
to grapple with
that in my own life,

01:03:35.810 --> 01:03:43.140
and not sort of quarantine
it away from my public self.

01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:47.540
And so I took the
step of going out.

01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:49.850
I mean, it was
uncomfortable for me

01:03:49.850 --> 01:03:53.870
because I'm not somebody
who writes personally.

01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:57.560
But it was greatly
liberating in many ways.

01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:01.460
- I'll just say that--

01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:03.450
so I have to do a TV show.

01:04:03.450 --> 01:04:05.960
I get to do a TV show
every week, not have to.

01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:09.020
And I just had my first child.

01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:13.460
And I cannot tell you how
incredibly uncomfortable it

01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:16.250
made me, being
pregnant on television,

01:04:16.250 --> 01:04:20.420
and being sort of forced to
acknowledge this amazing thing

01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:21.470
that was happening.

01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:23.720
But to talk about it
and acknowledge it

01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:26.340
in any kind of public way
made me really uncomfortable.

01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:29.480
So I'm dealing with
that at the same time

01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:31.580
that I'm working
on this book that

01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:35.600
is exposing deep family
secrets and all kinds

01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:37.820
of transgressions.

01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:39.860
And at a certain point,
I thought, my god, Alex,

01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:43.042
if you have a hard time talking
about being pregnant on TV, how

01:04:43.042 --> 01:04:44.750
the F are you going
to deal with the fact

01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:46.208
that this book is
going to come out

01:04:46.208 --> 01:04:48.860
and everybody's going
to think and understand

01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:51.330
very intimate details
about your family.

01:04:51.330 --> 01:04:53.990
And I guess one of the ways
I sort of overcame that

01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:56.780
or I've rationalized that--
the book isn't out yet, right--

01:04:56.780 --> 01:05:03.530
It's coming out in April of next
year, is, all of the stories

01:05:03.530 --> 01:05:06.320
and the transgressions and the
sins, if you will of my family,

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:09.290
dovetail with national sins.

01:05:09.290 --> 01:05:14.240
And in many ways every
story is discrete, right,

01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:16.250
but there are lessons
in all of this

01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:18.710
that apply to the current
political climate,

01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:21.599
and the ways in which we
think about our sense of place

01:05:21.599 --> 01:05:22.640
and our sense of country.

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:25.490
And I think in that way
it felt like, OK, it's

01:05:25.490 --> 01:05:29.180
going to be painful when
Aunt Kathy calls me and says,

01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:30.320
this is bullshit.

01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:33.110
But at the same time,
it's good for us and it's

01:05:33.110 --> 01:05:35.460
good for the conversation
to be talking about this.

01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:36.680
- Did they know what
you were going to say?

01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:38.540
I mean, are there are sort of
things that they figured you

01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:39.980
would have to cover
and say don't--

01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:41.563
- The legal department
at Random House

01:05:41.563 --> 01:05:44.240
has been very thorough
about me going over the more

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:45.680
controversial parts.

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:47.260
I think I'm fair in the end.

01:05:47.260 --> 01:05:50.696
It's tough to write about
people who are still alive,

01:05:50.696 --> 01:05:52.621
mostly because everybody
has an idea about how

01:05:52.621 --> 01:05:53.870
they want to be written about.

01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:55.460
Right?

01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:59.180
But I think I'm fair, and I
went through the more difficult

01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:01.390
passages with those
who are still alive.

01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:06.260
My father actually passed away
before the book was finished.

01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:08.810
But for those who
are still alive,

01:06:08.810 --> 01:06:10.070
I think they'll be OK with it.

01:06:10.070 --> 01:06:13.320
Like I said, the book is not
out yet, so the full fallout,

01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:15.260
we'll see in the
spring of next year.

01:06:18.050 --> 01:06:22.550
- Well, you know, I
would say that for me,

01:06:22.550 --> 01:06:27.770
once my father told me a kind of
sanitized version of the family

01:06:27.770 --> 01:06:28.910
scandal--

01:06:28.910 --> 01:06:32.520
and keep in mind, I was
middle-aged by that point.

01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:34.430
I was in my early 40s.

01:06:34.430 --> 01:06:38.540
So this had been a
deeply hidden secret.

01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:41.120
Once that happened--
I mean, I kind of

01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:43.820
had a stew of
emotions about that.

01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:47.660
I mean, I found it
fascinating, but I was also

01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:50.510
kind of angry about the
fact that they somehow

01:06:50.510 --> 01:06:53.630
imagined I was so fragile
emotionally that they had--

01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:55.126
I mean, that's the way that--

01:06:55.126 --> 01:06:56.750
I'm not sure if that's
true, but that's

01:06:56.750 --> 01:07:00.100
the way that I internalized
it or absorbed it.

01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:03.330
- Do you think they could
of been embarrassed?

01:07:03.330 --> 01:07:04.650
- Oh, yes.

01:07:04.650 --> 01:07:05.980
- It's about fragility.

01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:08.490
I mean, not just--

01:07:08.490 --> 01:07:11.550
- I mean, this was my
initial reaction-- began,

01:07:11.550 --> 01:07:15.420
as I researched it, I began to
think that they really imagined

01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:19.980
that they were being protective.

01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:22.220
And I think that they
were embarrassed.

01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:26.940
I mean, keep in mind
that my parents grew up

01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:30.300
at a point in time when there
were these eugenicist ideas

01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:31.470
out there.

01:07:31.470 --> 01:07:33.330
And my mother only
told me that she

01:07:33.330 --> 01:07:37.170
was Irish in the final
days at her nursing home.

01:07:37.170 --> 01:07:37.901
I said, what?

01:07:37.901 --> 01:07:39.585
You're what?

01:07:39.585 --> 01:07:41.190
What?

01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:43.510
She said, yes, well it wasn't
a good thing to be dear,

01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:51.750
then in Colorado Springs,
you know, in the 1910s.

01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:53.830
Yeah, that was something.

01:07:53.830 --> 01:07:58.950
So that I would say that for
me, why I felt driven to write

01:07:58.950 --> 01:08:04.350
it had actually more to do
with the intellectual challenge

01:08:04.350 --> 01:08:06.960
of it.

01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:12.090
I had a story that was a great
story to entertain people

01:08:12.090 --> 01:08:14.310
with at dinner parties.

01:08:14.310 --> 01:08:15.030
You know.

01:08:15.030 --> 01:08:17.609
I had this philanderer
grandfather.

01:08:17.609 --> 01:08:19.260
He was an embezzler.

01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:21.367
His life did not
come to a good end.

01:08:21.367 --> 01:08:22.950
I want you to buy
the book, so I'm not

01:08:22.950 --> 01:08:24.830
going to tell you what happened.

01:08:24.830 --> 01:08:25.881
- Did you know him?

01:08:25.881 --> 01:08:26.380
- No.

01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:27.479
No, no, no.

01:08:27.479 --> 01:08:30.580
I did not know my grandparents.

01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:32.990
- Do you think you could
of done this if you did?

01:08:32.990 --> 01:08:35.090
- Well, that's a very
interesting question.

01:08:35.090 --> 01:08:39.319
And I think it would have been
a much harder book to write.

01:08:39.319 --> 01:08:41.540
Even as it was, I
mean, it could be--

01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:44.630
when I saw my grandfather's
final letter that he ever

01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:49.550
wrote to his wife, to
my grandmother, that

01:08:49.550 --> 01:08:50.779
was very affecting.

01:08:50.779 --> 01:08:54.020
And even some of the telegrams
that passed between them,

01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:57.319
because they tended to
communicate via telegram,

01:08:57.319 --> 01:08:59.689
which is its own story.

01:08:59.689 --> 01:09:03.470
I can remember a conversation
with my agent who said, well,

01:09:03.470 --> 01:09:05.930
Alice, telegrams, hmm.

01:09:05.930 --> 01:09:10.490
Kind of hard to write a
book around telegrams.

01:09:10.490 --> 01:09:13.210
It turns out not to
be true actually.

01:09:13.210 --> 01:09:17.148
But what I really
wanted to do was to--

01:09:17.148 --> 01:09:19.370
I think it was
Liz-- it was either

01:09:19.370 --> 01:09:21.710
Liz or Jane who talked
about opening up

01:09:21.710 --> 01:09:24.529
new vistas onto US history.

01:09:24.529 --> 01:09:28.310
And, you know, the first
few drafts of this book

01:09:28.310 --> 01:09:30.560
were pretty crappy.

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:33.529
And my agent didn't like
it, and some of my friends

01:09:33.529 --> 01:09:34.430
didn't even like it.

01:09:34.430 --> 01:09:36.609
One of them is here
in the audience.

01:09:36.609 --> 01:09:42.500
And so my task became, OK, what
are the bigger stories here?

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:49.189
I knew that there was
something in his story,

01:09:49.189 --> 01:09:50.840
and in my grandparents
story that

01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:54.890
would allow me to re-narrate
key parts of American history.

01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:56.570
And that's what I wanted to do.

01:09:56.570 --> 01:10:00.950
And damn it, was going
to do it if it killed me.

01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:02.260
- Gail?

01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:06.800
- Well actually, I wrote the
book, all three of my books

01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:09.260
because I'm really in love
with American history,

01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:12.290
probably because of
professor Schlesinger's A,

01:10:12.290 --> 01:10:17.600
but also because my
grandfather's trunk.

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:20.540
In this there was a letter
from Benjamin Harrison

01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:22.190
to my great grandfather.

01:10:22.190 --> 01:10:24.260
I'm like, Benjamin Harrison.

01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:29.720
There were telegrams for my
grandfather going to the fight

01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:32.940
to see Jack--

01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:34.730
anyway.

01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:36.380
Great prizefighters.

01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:40.610
And going on July 4th, 1929
going somewhere, going to

01:10:40.610 --> 01:10:42.800
speakeasies.

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:46.550
There was a speakeasy card
that said, to Mr. Teddy Horne,

01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:47.770
when does this expire?

01:10:47.770 --> 01:10:49.700
Never.

01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:52.880
And I thought, this
is really very, very--

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:56.330
I mean, I don't know this stuff,
and I think it's interesting.

01:10:56.330 --> 01:10:59.162
So I wrote my book because I
thought it was interesting.

01:10:59.162 --> 01:11:00.620
It was certainly
interesting to me.

01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:02.040
- A part of American
history as well.

01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:02.650
- Yes.

01:11:02.650 --> 01:11:07.200
- I think we should go to
questions from you guys.

01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:09.270
And remember to say who you are.

01:11:13.815 --> 01:11:14.440
- Hi, everyone.

01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:16.064
Thank you so much
for this great panel.

01:11:16.064 --> 01:11:16.960
I'm Lauren Williams.

01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:19.400
I'm a fellow here at the Nieman
Foundation for Journalism

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:22.680
and I'm an editor at Essence
Magazine in New York.

01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:24.720
And I have two questions.

01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:28.310
The first is for Alice, and
it touches on the question

01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:30.590
that you sort of
ended with about why

01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:33.770
we are so forgiving
of capitalism,

01:11:33.770 --> 01:11:36.890
and so not of
systemic inequality.

01:11:36.890 --> 01:11:40.310
And it's something that my
fellow journalists and I

01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:43.730
talk about all the time,
especially in the Trump era.

01:11:43.730 --> 01:11:47.480
Why this poor white Midwesterner
sees more in common with Trump

01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:51.560
than they do with the poor
black Midwesterner in this phase

01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:52.662
of economic anxiety.

01:11:52.662 --> 01:11:54.620
And I think black
journalists feel like there's

01:11:54.620 --> 01:11:55.850
a little more nuance there.

01:11:55.850 --> 01:11:57.360
There's something else going on.

01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:01.100
So I just want to know
if you, in your work,

01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:03.950
found any sort of
answers to that question?

01:12:03.950 --> 01:12:05.880
- Well, it's really
fascinating--

01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:10.460
I mean, it is I think one of
the central areas for scholars

01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:12.130
to be to be working in.

01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:17.810
What I found when I was doing
research on the depression,

01:12:17.810 --> 01:12:20.180
and I was looking at
letters that people wrote,

01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:23.000
particularly to the
governor of Colorado, who

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.030
was a Democrat, but
not a New Dealer--

01:12:26.030 --> 01:12:28.160
a guy named Big Ed Johnson.

01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:33.620
I mean, I was shocked by
the amount of resentment,

01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:36.890
the politics of resentment,
that were directed

01:12:36.890 --> 01:12:42.860
towards other white
people actually mostly,

01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:44.940
who were on relief.

01:12:44.940 --> 01:12:50.240
And I think that in the
Depression years, some

01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:53.990
of that initial
sort of antagonism

01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:58.730
towards the government
that was really

01:12:58.730 --> 01:13:02.810
a pretty sizable movement,
this anti-tax movement

01:13:02.810 --> 01:13:05.480
in the late '20s and
early '30s, which

01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:07.190
eventually sort of subsides.

01:13:07.190 --> 01:13:11.510
And it subsides because more
and more white working people--

01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:13.580
and whites more
generally are benefiting

01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:15.680
from New Deal programs.

01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:16.940
Right.

01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:20.890
And so that kind
of initial feeling

01:13:20.890 --> 01:13:26.300
that there are these people
feeding at the public trough

01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:27.920
that need to be
gotten rid of-- they

01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:30.350
need to be eliminated
from the rolls.

01:13:30.350 --> 01:13:32.840
You know, this tax
payers league in Colorado

01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:35.480
actually opposed
the old age pension.

01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:36.020
Right.

01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:39.260
I mean they were really
punitive towards other people,

01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:40.530
and towards their neighbors.

01:13:40.530 --> 01:13:42.230
It was quite shocking to me.

01:13:42.230 --> 01:13:45.080
But I think, again,
the New Deal sort of

01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:49.310
wins them over for a period of
time until it gets to the point

01:13:49.310 --> 01:13:54.200
where the welfare
rolls begin to shift

01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:57.950
and it begins to be, it's
not the case that, oh, well--

01:13:57.950 --> 01:14:00.350
there's the whole
rhetoric of welfare queens

01:14:00.350 --> 01:14:03.590
that you begin to find
in the '60s and the '70s

01:14:03.590 --> 01:14:05.390
and beyond, and
especially under Reagan.

01:14:05.390 --> 01:14:06.860
Right.

01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:13.370
I think during this
period of time, relief,

01:14:13.370 --> 01:14:20.150
government programs come to
be understood as racialized,

01:14:20.150 --> 01:14:29.400
and self-reliance comes to be
even more understood as white.

01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:32.040
That's the best I can do
off the cuff right here.

01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:34.440
But I think it's a
central, central question

01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:37.200
that we need to be grappling
with and thank you for asking.

01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:38.220
- Yeah, of course.

01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:41.230
- Just really quickly, my second
question is for Ms. Buckley,

01:14:41.230 --> 01:14:42.750
and then also you, Annette.

01:14:42.750 --> 01:14:46.260
The work that you guys do
in sort of unearthing truth

01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:47.940
about American
history, specifically

01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:51.330
about black Jeffersons and
black Calhouns, I'm sure

01:14:51.330 --> 01:14:54.750
has been met with much
pushback from other scholars

01:14:54.750 --> 01:14:58.350
and historians who don't
want these stories to be real

01:14:58.350 --> 01:14:59.750
or to be in the public sphere.

01:14:59.750 --> 01:15:02.430
So I just wanted to know
how that resistance informs

01:15:02.430 --> 01:15:03.460
the work you do--

01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:06.360
this sort of pushback you
get about the legitimacy

01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:08.860
of these stories, if you
could talk about that at all?

01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:10.500
- I never got any pushback back.

01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:14.250
In fact, the amazing thing to me
was meeting the white Calhouns

01:15:14.250 --> 01:15:18.280
in Atlanta, who said, yes,
of course, we're all related.

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:21.370
You know what so and so and so.

01:15:21.370 --> 01:15:22.530
So I thought, OK.

01:15:22.530 --> 01:15:23.650
They accepted it.

01:15:23.650 --> 01:15:27.580
They probably would not
have accepted it in 1888,

01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:31.530
but they accepted it in
2016, and were quite pleased

01:15:31.530 --> 01:15:32.800
about it.

01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:35.720
- Well, I mean, I got a little
bit of pushback from people.

01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:36.240
- Yeah.

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:37.519
- But, I mean-- no.

01:15:37.519 --> 01:15:39.060
I mean, people write
to other people.

01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:40.785
They never write to me.

01:15:40.785 --> 01:15:42.160
No, seriously,
that's what it is.

01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:45.270
I mean, people write to people
about me, not to me directly.

01:15:45.270 --> 01:15:50.280
So I got pushback, but
that sort of went away

01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:53.880
as much when Monticello and
the Thomas Jefferson Foundation

01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:55.230
sort of got on board with it.

01:15:55.230 --> 01:15:56.970
But people still
write, you know,

01:15:56.970 --> 01:15:58.920
Annette Gordon-Reed
is the devil books,

01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:03.790
but they don't write
directly to me about it.

01:16:03.790 --> 01:16:07.220
- My name is Susanna Grannis,
and I graduated from Radcliffe

01:16:07.220 --> 01:16:10.060
58 years ago.

01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:11.060
And I haven't been back.

01:16:11.060 --> 01:16:13.020
I must have been back,
but I don't remember it.

01:16:13.020 --> 01:16:16.240
And I was so pleased to
walk into the Radcliffe Yard

01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:19.000
and see that it was the same.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.320
That's really wonderful.

01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:24.520
I'm here because there
is a family secret that

01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:27.010
has been uncovered
in our family,

01:16:27.010 --> 01:16:29.710
oddly enough all
these years later

01:16:29.710 --> 01:16:34.450
by three grandchildren
of my grandfather

01:16:34.450 --> 01:16:37.240
named Armfield
Franklin VanBibber--

01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:41.200
a very unfortunate name,
because Franklin and Armfield

01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:46.210
were leading slave
traders between Alexandria

01:16:46.210 --> 01:16:49.240
and Louisiana for many years.

01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:51.040
They became very wealthy.

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:52.910
So we're going into it.

01:16:52.910 --> 01:16:57.320
We went to a little
museum in September

01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:03.490
that was the slave pens of the
Armfield office in Alexandria.

01:17:03.490 --> 01:17:09.470
So my question is
seeking advice.

01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:14.680
I'm reading about this,
I'm learning about this.

01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:17.490
My brother is as well.

01:17:17.490 --> 01:17:19.060
And we are so obsessed.

01:17:19.060 --> 01:17:20.800
But where do we go?

01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:24.910
Where do you go with this
information about your family

01:17:24.910 --> 01:17:29.740
and what people in your family
have done that is so horrible?

01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:33.240
What does one do with
something like that?

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:37.020
So anybody who would like to
answer, I would appreciate it.

01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:38.910
Thank you.

01:17:38.910 --> 01:17:40.920
- Well, that's a tough one.

01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:43.877
Share it with the
rest of your family.

01:17:43.877 --> 01:17:45.460
Share it with the
rest of your family.

01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:47.560
Share it with your friends.

01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:51.040
You can become involved
in organizations

01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:55.830
that are trying to
improve the community--

01:17:55.830 --> 01:18:01.420
things for recompense in a
way to take to pay it forward

01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:03.690
in a way.

01:18:03.690 --> 01:18:05.920
I think it would be enough--

01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:08.350
a good beginning, the fact
that you're grappling with it

01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:11.560
yourself, and you're
being honest with it.

01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:13.780
Because there are so
many people who wouldn't

01:18:13.780 --> 01:18:15.280
be involved with it at all.

01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:17.730
So that's a step in
the right direction.

01:18:17.730 --> 01:18:21.700
Do other people have other
ideas other than making

01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:25.684
it a part of your family's
story, and making sure

01:18:25.684 --> 01:18:27.350
that other people
know about it as well?

01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:29.930
You might write
something about it?

01:18:29.930 --> 01:18:32.750
Joshua Rothman is a
young historian who

01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:34.490
has been writing about this--

01:18:34.490 --> 01:18:35.370
- [INAUDIBLE]

01:18:35.370 --> 01:18:35.870
- Yeah.

01:18:35.870 --> 01:18:37.078
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

01:18:37.078 --> 01:18:40.220
Yeah, he's been
writing about this.

01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:41.294
Get in touch with him.

01:18:41.294 --> 01:18:42.710
I mean, there are
all kinds-- what

01:18:42.710 --> 01:18:44.900
had happened with the
Jefferson thing is

01:18:44.900 --> 01:18:50.150
that members of the family have
been together different places

01:18:50.150 --> 01:18:53.460
and they have gone and
spoken about what this means.

01:18:53.460 --> 01:18:55.520
And they sort of grappled
with it very publicly.

01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:58.550
I don't know if you're a
public person in that way,

01:18:58.550 --> 01:19:02.695
but that's one way that those
descendants have dealt with it.

01:19:02.695 --> 01:19:04.320
- I would just second
the idea that you

01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:06.660
have to weave the truth
into the family narrative

01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:09.760
and keep handing it forward
into future generations.

01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:11.640
And the thing that I
found at the end of this

01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:17.430
is, finding your
people in the past

01:19:17.430 --> 01:19:20.430
is a really tricky concept,
because the community that we

01:19:20.430 --> 01:19:22.170
have in the present
is really the tribe

01:19:22.170 --> 01:19:23.975
that we should be focused on.

01:19:23.975 --> 01:19:26.100
And I think too often and
we look backwards instead

01:19:26.100 --> 01:19:28.516
of looking around us, especially
in this particular moment

01:19:28.516 --> 01:19:29.250
in time.

01:19:29.250 --> 01:19:31.230
Reinforcing the threads
of community or kind

01:19:31.230 --> 01:19:33.180
of the urgent task at hand.

01:19:35.770 --> 01:19:36.320
- Next.

01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:37.540
- Hi.

01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:38.860
My name's Edward Ball.

01:19:38.860 --> 01:19:41.960
I'm a write.

01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:47.660
I wrote some five books that
each has a family history

01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:50.340
strands.

01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:52.900
Probably the one that's better
known than the others is

01:19:52.900 --> 01:19:54.260
called, Slaves in the Family.

01:19:54.260 --> 01:19:55.560
- Oh yeah.

01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:59.330
- Which I'll get to in a moment.

01:19:59.330 --> 01:20:06.420
But family history used to be
a form of public relations.

01:20:06.420 --> 01:20:11.420
It was the idiots
genre of storytelling

01:20:11.420 --> 01:20:14.210
and of historiography.

01:20:14.210 --> 01:20:16.490
Fortunately it's no longer that.

01:20:16.490 --> 01:20:22.130
And our panel is
good evidence of it.

01:20:22.130 --> 01:20:25.550
It seems to me to involve--

01:20:25.550 --> 01:20:27.860
my experience is that
doing family history

01:20:27.860 --> 01:20:30.790
involves a degree
of psychoanalysis,

01:20:30.790 --> 01:20:33.520
not only psychoanalysis
on one's subjects

01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:34.910
but psychoanalysis
on one's self.

01:20:37.510 --> 01:20:42.250
And in analysis one
uncovers motives in oneself

01:20:42.250 --> 01:20:48.820
such as exhibitionism,
aggression,

01:20:48.820 --> 01:20:54.670
and other uncomfortable
pieces of one's identity.

01:20:54.670 --> 01:20:56.470
I wonder if some
of the panelists

01:20:56.470 --> 01:21:02.380
have considered this
analogy of their project

01:21:02.380 --> 01:21:07.490
to a form of psychoanalysis?

01:21:07.490 --> 01:21:10.720
What one does is look at
symptoms in one's own family--

01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:19.964
places of conflict and
trauma and picks at them.

01:21:19.964 --> 01:21:21.505
That's one thing I
wanted to observe.

01:21:21.505 --> 01:21:26.780
But about the last speaker,
the last questioner

01:21:26.780 --> 01:21:32.350
who talked about being descended
from the slave trading firm

01:21:32.350 --> 01:21:38.290
run by Isaac Franklin
during the mid-19th century.

01:21:38.290 --> 01:21:44.490
Franklin and Armfield,
I would suggest

01:21:44.490 --> 01:21:49.800
trying to tell that
story in a public way.

01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:57.290
There is a cathartic
and important--

01:21:57.290 --> 01:21:59.550
this probably gets
us back to analysis.

01:21:59.550 --> 01:22:04.230
There is an effect of
catharsis and relief

01:22:04.230 --> 01:22:09.390
in telling stories of
historical trauma and injury

01:22:09.390 --> 01:22:10.650
in a public way.

01:22:10.650 --> 01:22:11.981
- OK.

01:22:11.981 --> 01:22:12.480
OK.

01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:15.684
- For those who are
here and also for those

01:22:15.684 --> 01:22:16.600
to tell those stories.

01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:17.100
- Yeah.

01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:18.720
- Yeah.

01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:20.140
- Anybody want to go?

01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:22.140
- Oh I just wanted
to say that I think

01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:25.080
I would be fascinated
to read the story,

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:26.380
because I don't know about it.

01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:28.740
I don't know about these people.

01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:30.510
Because when I was
in Charleston, just

01:22:30.510 --> 01:22:34.680
for no other reason, the big
tourist place is the slave--

01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:36.180
this is the slave market.

01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:37.960
Come and see the slave market.

01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:41.530
So I would love to
read about your family.

01:22:41.530 --> 01:22:43.390
And I think you don't
need to apologize.

01:22:43.390 --> 01:22:47.475
You do need to apologize,
but it's not you that did it.

01:22:47.475 --> 01:22:50.845
So it would be interesting.

01:22:50.845 --> 01:22:53.110
- Anyone want to talk
about psychoanalysis?

01:22:53.110 --> 01:22:54.692
- Oh, well.

01:22:54.692 --> 01:22:56.556
[LAUGHTER]

01:22:59.820 --> 01:23:01.280
- All right, I'll go.

01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:04.590
- You'll go and then
one more question.

01:23:04.590 --> 01:23:07.590
- To psychoanalysis that is.

01:23:07.590 --> 01:23:10.140
Yeah, you know, there
are many-- well,

01:23:10.140 --> 01:23:12.660
I was going to say there
are many times I felt

01:23:12.660 --> 01:23:15.390
I needed to be in
intensive therapy

01:23:15.390 --> 01:23:17.670
to get through
this book project.

01:23:17.670 --> 01:23:21.240
I think I was also a
therapist for my father, who

01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:27.060
was utterly opposed to any form
of psychoanalysis or psychology

01:23:27.060 --> 01:23:30.570
or counseling, unfortunately.

01:23:30.570 --> 01:23:39.990
And to get approval to have
gender reassignment surgery,

01:23:39.990 --> 01:23:46.860
she needed two letters from
mental health professionals.

01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:56.520
And she went and saw two
different people once,

01:23:56.520 --> 01:24:00.270
and she tossed aside
the one letter that

01:24:00.270 --> 01:24:09.330
said that they thought she
had troubles with identity

01:24:09.330 --> 01:24:13.410
more generally, but
after one session

01:24:13.410 --> 01:24:18.890
she couldn't say for
sure that it was gender.

01:24:18.890 --> 01:24:24.420
And the other psychologist
didn't actually

01:24:24.420 --> 01:24:25.680
write a letter till later.

01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:29.670
So my father then went
out and made up a letter

01:24:29.670 --> 01:24:30.810
from a friend--

01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:38.550
a female friend and wrote it
in this sort of feathery font,

01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:41.130
thinking that that would
make it look more authentic

01:24:41.130 --> 01:24:45.270
or something and sent it off
to the surgeon from my father's

01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:48.470
email account.

01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:51.630
And the surgeon went
ahead and said, fine.

01:24:51.630 --> 01:24:55.890
So the surgeon I had an
interesting conversation

01:24:55.890 --> 01:24:58.170
about that later.

01:24:58.170 --> 01:25:00.660
Although, as it
turns out, you know,

01:25:00.660 --> 01:25:04.950
my father never
regretted the surgery

01:25:04.950 --> 01:25:08.520
and it was one of the
few things that she

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:11.430
was happy with until
the day she died.

01:25:11.430 --> 01:25:15.250
So this is not actually an
indictment of the surgeon,

01:25:15.250 --> 01:25:16.176
although--

01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:21.420
Well, I'll leave it at that.

01:25:21.420 --> 01:25:25.560
Incidentally, Susan, you, at the
end of your remarks noted that

01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:28.950
some of the common
threads-- a strong man--

01:25:28.950 --> 01:25:31.770
if we're talking about strong
men faking medical letters,

01:25:31.770 --> 01:25:34.010
I seem to remember
a moment last year

01:25:34.010 --> 01:25:36.961
where we were treated to Donald
Trump's personal physician's

01:25:36.961 --> 01:25:37.460
letter.

01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:39.800
Just putting that out there.

01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:41.680
[LAUGHTER]

01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:42.810
I'm just saying.

01:25:42.810 --> 01:25:43.500
Yeah.

01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:46.301
- Not saying, just saying.

01:25:46.301 --> 01:25:46.800
- OK.

01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:48.740
I think we have--

01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:50.790
yeah, go ahead.

01:25:50.790 --> 01:25:52.170
- Oh, I'm Rayshauna Gray.

01:25:52.170 --> 01:25:53.640
I coordinate the
gender initiative

01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:56.610
over at the business school,
and I'm a historical researcher

01:25:56.610 --> 01:25:57.990
at Tufts.

01:25:57.990 --> 01:26:00.210
So I'm writing the story
of the last two centuries

01:26:00.210 --> 01:26:03.990
of my family's history
through the lives of my six

01:26:03.990 --> 01:26:06.630
direct female ancestors, or the
six most recent ones and then

01:26:06.630 --> 01:26:08.220
me.

01:26:08.220 --> 01:26:10.080
And it feels overwhelming.

01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:13.570
And I'm, of course, unearthing
a whole bunch of unfortunate,

01:26:13.570 --> 01:26:16.740
tense topics like enslavement,
like failed Reconstruction

01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:18.060
and the like.

01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:22.440
How did you all know that you
did your ancestor's justice

01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:24.450
when you wrote about them?

01:26:24.450 --> 01:26:28.816
And if you did,
how did you know?

01:26:28.816 --> 01:26:30.800
Were you even aiming for it?

01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:39.491
- This is an
interesting question.

01:26:39.491 --> 01:26:39.990
Thank you.

01:26:39.990 --> 01:26:43.550
I mean, I heard from
another historian recently,

01:26:43.550 --> 01:26:46.880
a labor historian,
Nelson Lichtenstein,

01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:48.230
who really loved the book.

01:26:48.230 --> 01:26:52.400
And he said to me
in this email, I

01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:55.700
wish I had been able
to do for my forebears

01:26:55.700 --> 01:26:57.680
what you've done for yours.

01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:00.080
And I wrote him back
and said, well, I'm

01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:03.110
not sure that that's the way
that they would feel, however.

01:27:05.650 --> 01:27:08.260
And I guess that for me--

01:27:08.260 --> 01:27:09.720
mine is a very different story.

01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:10.220
Right?

01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:13.640
I mean, I'm exposing
something that my grandfather

01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:17.420
did that was venal.

01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:22.700
And so perhaps my
response to your question

01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:25.190
would be very different from
that of other panelists.

01:27:25.190 --> 01:27:30.590
But I never saw it as
doing them justice.

01:27:30.590 --> 01:27:32.750
That was never my goal.

01:27:32.750 --> 01:27:34.400
I wanted to be fair.

01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:35.690
I wanted to be fair.

01:27:35.690 --> 01:27:37.565
And I struggled with that.

01:27:37.565 --> 01:27:41.330
I struggled with, am
I hyper-correcting her

01:27:41.330 --> 01:27:45.020
because of what I've
read about my grandfather

01:27:45.020 --> 01:27:48.530
and maybe I should
be more sympathetic?

01:27:48.530 --> 01:27:52.310
Or am I being too sympathetic
towards the women?

01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:56.610
Because I had more evidence
of their suffering.

01:27:56.610 --> 01:28:00.870
But doing justice doesn't
quite capture what I was up to.

01:28:00.870 --> 01:28:03.380
I really wanted to--

01:28:03.380 --> 01:28:07.530
as I said, it was about
re-narrating American history.

01:28:07.530 --> 01:28:09.530
- Also, our ancestors
have been doing themselves

01:28:09.530 --> 01:28:10.820
justice for a long time.

01:28:10.820 --> 01:28:13.100
So maybe it's our job
to hold their feet

01:28:13.100 --> 01:28:14.420
to the fire a little bit.

01:28:14.420 --> 01:28:17.532
Don't worry too much
about it is my advice.

01:28:17.532 --> 01:28:19.615
- Thank you.

01:28:19.615 --> 01:28:23.480
- With my extended
family, they were glad

01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:26.780
that someone was
pulling together

01:28:26.780 --> 01:28:28.715
the threads of family history.

01:28:31.970 --> 01:28:36.110
And were actually
glad that I was

01:28:36.110 --> 01:28:39.660
trying to figure out this
incredible enigma of my father.

01:28:39.660 --> 01:28:41.810
So I had a fair
amount of support

01:28:41.810 --> 01:28:47.060
from my father's
extended family.

01:28:47.060 --> 01:28:48.530
- Hi, I'm Caroline.

01:28:48.530 --> 01:28:50.780
I'm a public history
graduate student.

01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:54.140
And there's actually
several of us here.

01:28:54.140 --> 01:28:57.560
So I'm thinking
about in the spaces

01:28:57.560 --> 01:29:00.830
that we tell stories
about American history

01:29:00.830 --> 01:29:04.910
that tend to be more simplified
or tell a linear narrative--

01:29:04.910 --> 01:29:09.140
you know, museums, textbooks,
really the public history--

01:29:09.140 --> 01:29:10.760
venue.

01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:13.310
Obviously all of your
stories complicate

01:29:13.310 --> 01:29:16.830
these, the narratives that we've
been telling about the past.

01:29:16.830 --> 01:29:20.120
So do you have any vision
for what can be done?

01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:23.240
Or what does this mean for
how we talk about the past,

01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:27.290
say like, within an exhibit
panel or places where you

01:29:27.290 --> 01:29:31.110
can't tell a book length story?

01:29:31.110 --> 01:29:35.160
- I'll just say really quickly,
one of the ways I feel like

01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:39.720
the past can help change the
narrative is by re-examining

01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:41.230
current events in
a different light.

01:29:41.230 --> 01:29:44.280
So for example in Burma
there's a mass ethnic cleansing

01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:46.500
being undertaken in
part of the country.

01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:50.820
The Rohingya are a marginalized
ethnic tribe in Burma.

01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:52.620
And the current
military government

01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:54.810
has waged a very
bloody campaign.

01:29:54.810 --> 01:29:58.330
463,000 of them have fled
to nearby Bangladesh.

01:29:58.330 --> 01:30:00.300
And everyone sort of
looks at this moment

01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:04.710
and says, well, how is it that
a Buddhist nation is killing

01:30:04.710 --> 01:30:07.410
its own, throwing babies
into fires, displacing

01:30:07.410 --> 01:30:09.780
hundreds and thousands of
innocent men and women?

01:30:09.780 --> 01:30:11.550
And the truth is--
and I discovered this

01:30:11.550 --> 01:30:12.600
in my research--

01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:16.050
Burmese Buddhist nationalism
has been a scourge on Burmese

01:30:16.050 --> 01:30:19.380
society for over 100 years.

01:30:19.380 --> 01:30:21.600
And it's part of my
family's own story,

01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:23.740
and it dovetails with the
history of the nation.

01:30:23.740 --> 01:30:26.760
And I think once you have
that information about Burmese

01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:29.280
nationalism and the fact that
its roots stretch back much

01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:31.235
further than we think,
one can re-examine

01:30:31.235 --> 01:30:33.360
what's happening in the
country in the present day,

01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:35.760
and almost sort
of rewrite history

01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:37.987
to be more accurate
in real time.

01:30:37.987 --> 01:30:39.570
That's a discrete
example, but I think

01:30:39.570 --> 01:30:41.903
that's one of the ways in
which the past and the present

01:30:41.903 --> 01:30:43.894
interconnect.

01:30:43.894 --> 01:30:45.685
- Well, thank you very
much, the panelists.

01:30:45.685 --> 01:30:47.480
With that, we will wrap up.

01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:48.650
Thank you guys for coming.

01:30:48.650 --> 01:30:52.000
[APPLAUSE]
