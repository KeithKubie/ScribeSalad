I'M AN ANIMAL PLASTIC SURGEON.

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:51.418 line:0%
 
COULD WE BE ANY MORE DIFFERENT?

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:53.420

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:55.455
SEE?

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.891
I BROUGHT HIM BACK TO LIFE.

00:00:57.925 --> 00:00:59.826

[maniacal laughter]

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.196

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:04.831
I JUST STUCK THOSE ON THERE

00:01:04.865 --> 00:01:07.601
SO I'D HAVE SOMETHING
TO REFER TO.

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:11.305
- UGH, THIS IS SO UNFAIR.

00:01:11.338 --> 00:01:13.707
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M BACK
IN THIS HOUSE OF HORRORS.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.076
[eerie music]

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:20.180
- I LOVE YOU EVEN IF YOU ARE
A MURDERER.

00:01:20.214 --> 00:01:22.282
- WELL, I'M NOT A MURDERER,
PAPA!

00:01:22.316 --> 00:01:24.651
WHY DOES EVERYONE HAVE TO KEEP
BRINGING UP MY WIFE'S MURDER?

00:01:24.685 --> 00:01:27.621
LET'S JUST LET
SLEEPING DOGS LIE.

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:30.657

I WANT TO BE LEFT ALONE.

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:36.129
- WELL, IN THAT CASE,
WHY DON'T WE HAVE A PARTY?

00:01:36.163 --> 00:01:38.832
- NOBODY WANTS TO SEE ME.
THEY ALL THINK I'M A MURDERER.

00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:41.101
- INVITE YOUR GOOD FRIEND
KELSEY GRAMMER OVER.

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:42.636
I COULD MAKE SOME BAGEL BITES.

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:45.839
- CAN YOU JUST LEAVE MY ROOM,
PLEASE.

00:01:45.873 --> 00:01:48.542
