when you make killing so easy and when

you're sitting somewhere else and you

you're sitting somewhere else and you
drop a bomb off a drone and you mean

drop a bomb off a drone and you mean
 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.030
drop a bomb off a drone and you mean
maybe you don't even the drone doesn't

maybe you don't even the drone doesn't
 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.469

even stay around to see if the bomb hit
 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:26.789
even stay around to see if the bomb hit
the target because it's got something

it's such a great degree that you begin

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:43.689
it's such a great degree that you begin
 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:47.010
it's such a great degree that you begin
to wonder about whether some of the

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020
to wonder about whether some of the
 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.789
to wonder about whether some of the
natural moderating factors the human

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799
natural moderating factors the human
 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:55.249
natural moderating factors the human
desire not to cause wanton destruction

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259
desire not to cause wanton destruction
 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.120
desire not to cause wanton destruction
even though we do it all the time

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130
even though we do it all the time
 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.410
even though we do it all the time
whether

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420
 
 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.940
 
the kind of consideration that we give

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950
the kind of consideration that we give
 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.740
the kind of consideration that we give
before we kill someone when we know the

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750
before we kill someone when we know the
 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.630
before we kill someone when we know the
consequences of our actions will people

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640
consequences of our actions will people
 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.820
consequences of our actions will people
drop the bomb rather than not dropping

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830
drop the bomb rather than not dropping
 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.610
drop the bomb rather than not dropping
the bomb because the the sense of having

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620
the bomb because the the sense of having
 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.460
the bomb because the the sense of having
killed people has now become so abstract

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470
killed people has now become so abstract
 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.110
killed people has now become so abstract
those are real questions about the

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120
those are real questions about the
 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.860
those are real questions about the
future of warfare and if this develops

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870
future of warfare and if this develops
 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.500
future of warfare and if this develops
to a point where lots of warfare is

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510
to a point where lots of warfare is
 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.830
to a point where lots of warfare is
conducted that way where our enemy is

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840
conducted that way where our enemy is
 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.990
conducted that way where our enemy is
sitting in their bunkers in front of

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000
sitting in their bunkers in front of
 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.789
sitting in their bunkers in front of
computer screens and we're sitting and

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799
computer screens and we're sitting and
 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:31.670
computer screens and we're sitting and
our bunkers in front of computer screens

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680
our bunkers in front of computer screens

what that really means of course is that

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829
what that really means of course is that
 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:37.410
what that really means of course is that
the soldiers who are actually doing the

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420
the soldiers who are actually doing the
 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.569
the soldiers who are actually doing the
fighting will be instead of the least

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579
fighting will be instead of the least
 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:42.030
fighting will be instead of the least
protected people that is the people in

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040
protected people that is the people in
 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.680
protected people that is the people in
the streets of Baghdad who are going to

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690
the streets of Baghdad who are going to
 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.960
the streets of Baghdad who are going to
who the IEDs gonna hit they're gonna be

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970
who the IEDs gonna hit they're gonna be
 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.970
who the IEDs gonna hit they're gonna be
the most protected people sitting in

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980
the most protected people sitting in
 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.839
the most protected people sitting in
some bunker deep underground somewhere

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849
some bunker deep underground somewhere
 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:54.660
some bunker deep underground somewhere
so who are the bombs gonna hit so this

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670
so who are the bombs gonna hit so this
 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.720
so who are the bombs gonna hit so this
kind of a strategy actually ends up

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730
kind of a strategy actually ends up
 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.670
kind of a strategy actually ends up
protecting soldiers more and exposing

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680
protecting soldiers more and exposing
 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.130
protecting soldiers more and exposing
civilians more than even the way warfare

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140
civilians more than even the way warfare
 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.309
civilians more than even the way warfare
is being done now so in a sense Captain

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319
is being done now so in a sense Captain
 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.940

America is a nostalgic figure of a time

America is a nostalgic figure of a time
 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.580
America is a nostalgic figure of a time
when soldiers actually did the fighting

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590
when soldiers actually did the fighting
 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.490

herself though it wasn't her seemed to
be the best way to improve combat now

the worry is exactly the opposite that

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730
the worry is exactly the opposite that
 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.660
the worry is exactly the opposite that
the soldier in some sense becomes

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670
the soldier in some sense becomes
 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.159
the soldier in some sense becomes
irrelevant that or at least the the

irrelevant that or at least the the

woman can sit in front of that screen

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470
woman can sit in front of that screen

and press the buttons with as much skill
 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.050
and press the buttons with as much skill
as a man so when you don't need the

as a man so when you don't need the
 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.800
as a man so when you don't need the
physicality of combat you know a woman's

it's going in it will change the nature

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329
it's going in it will change the nature
 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:57.870
it's going in it will change the nature
of warfare and raise a new kind of

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880
of warfare and raise a new kind of
 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.190
of warfare and raise a new kind of
ethical calculus about the way in which
