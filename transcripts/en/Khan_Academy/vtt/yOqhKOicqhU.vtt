00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.886
- [Voiceover] Let's say
that we have an exponential

00:00:01.886 --> 00:00:03.116
function, h of n,

00:00:03.116 --> 00:00:04.625
and since it's an exponential function

00:00:04.625 --> 00:00:07.830
it's going to be in the
form a times r to the n,

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.339
where a is our initial value

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:10.648
and r is our common ratio,

00:00:10.648 --> 00:00:13.147
and we're going to assume
that r is greater than zero.

00:00:13.147 --> 00:00:15.631
And they've given us some
information on h of n.

00:00:15.631 --> 00:00:17.373
We know that when n is equal to 2,

00:00:17.373 --> 00:00:19.393
h of 2 is 144,

00:00:19.393 --> 00:00:21.599
that h of 4 is 324,

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:24.710
that h of 6 is 729.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.498
So, based on the information here,

00:00:26.498 --> 00:00:27.984
let's see if we can actually figure out

00:00:27.984 --> 00:00:31.142
what a and r are going to be.

00:00:31.142 --> 00:00:34.833
And like always, pause the
video and try to give it a go.

00:00:34.833 --> 00:00:36.737
All right, now let's do this together.

00:00:36.737 --> 00:00:39.384
So I'm going to focus on r first.

00:00:39.384 --> 00:00:41.706
The common ratio

00:00:41.706 --> 00:00:44.910
and if we had successive n's.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.836
If we had h of 3, then
we could just find the

00:00:47.836 --> 00:00:50.460
ratio between h of 3 and h of 2

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.294
and r would just come out of that,

00:00:52.294 --> 00:00:55.150
or if the ratio between h of 4 and h of 3,

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.938
we could solve explicitly for r,

00:00:56.938 --> 00:00:58.517
but we can get pretty close to that.

00:00:58.517 --> 00:01:00.630
We can just find the ratio between h of 4

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:01.907
and h of 2.

00:01:01.907 --> 00:01:04.229
So, h of 4,

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.854
the ratio between h of 4

00:01:05.854 --> 00:01:07.595
and h of 2

00:01:07.595 --> 00:01:09.615
is going to be equal to,

00:01:09.615 --> 00:01:13.075
well, we know h of 4 is 324,

00:01:13.075 --> 00:01:15.977
and h of 2 is 144,

00:01:15.977 --> 00:01:18.578
and we could simplify this a little bit.

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:20.691
Let's see, if we,

00:01:20.691 --> 00:01:23.245
if we simplify this, we would get,

00:01:23.245 --> 00:01:24.499
they're both divisible by 2.

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:25.985
If we divide them both by 2,

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:27.308
this one in the numerator,

00:01:27.308 --> 00:01:30.721
324 divided by 2 is 162.

00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:33.624
144 divided by 2 is 72.

00:01:33.624 --> 00:01:35.621
Let's see, we can divide by 2 again.

00:01:35.621 --> 00:01:38.430
81 over 36.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.289
Divide by 2,

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:41.100
actually, no, we can't
divide by 2 anymore,

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.865
but we can divide by 9 now,

00:01:42.865 --> 00:01:46.000
so 81 divided by 9 is 9,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.113
and 36 divided by 9 is 4.

00:01:48.113 --> 00:01:51.897
So this thing can be rewritten as 9/4,

00:01:51.897 --> 00:01:54.405
but we could also rewrite this ratio

00:01:54.405 --> 00:01:55.519
by using,

00:01:55.519 --> 00:01:58.700
using this form of an
exponential function,

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.254
so we could also say that
this is going to be equal to,

00:02:01.254 --> 00:02:03.367
h of 4 is going to be a

00:02:03.367 --> 00:02:04.993
times r.

00:02:04.993 --> 00:02:07.616
Now n is 4, so r to the 4th power,

00:02:07.616 --> 00:02:11.842
and h of 2 is going to be
a times r to the 2nd power.

00:02:11.842 --> 00:02:15.070
A times r to the 2nd power,

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.695
and this simplifies nicely,

00:02:16.695 --> 00:02:18.274
a divided by a,

00:02:18.274 --> 00:02:19.690
cancels to just 1,

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.500
and r to the 4th divided by r-squared,

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.613
well that's going to be
r to the 4 minus 2 power,

00:02:24.613 --> 00:02:25.402
or r,

00:02:25.402 --> 00:02:26.981
it's going to be r to the 2nd power,

00:02:26.981 --> 00:02:29.024
it's going to be r-squared,

00:02:29.024 --> 00:02:30.812
and so we have a nice
little equation set up.

00:02:30.812 --> 00:02:35.061
R-squared needs to be equal to 9/4.

00:02:35.061 --> 00:02:36.083
So let me write that down.

00:02:36.083 --> 00:02:38.382
R-squared is equal to 9/4,

00:02:38.382 --> 00:02:40.587
and r needs to be greater than zero,

00:02:40.587 --> 00:02:43.536
so we could just say r is
going to be the principal root

00:02:43.536 --> 00:02:45.719
of 9/4,

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:48.528
which is equal to 3/2.

00:02:48.528 --> 00:02:51.315
So we were able to figure out r.

00:02:51.315 --> 00:02:53.056
So now how do we figure out,

00:02:53.056 --> 00:02:55.378
how do we figure out a?

00:02:55.378 --> 00:02:56.980
Well, there's a couple of ways to do it.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.533
You can think about a is
going to be what h of zero

00:03:00.533 --> 00:03:01.392
is equal to,

00:03:01.392 --> 00:03:02.274
so we could do,

00:03:02.274 --> 00:03:04.758
I guess we could call it a tabular method,

00:03:04.758 --> 00:03:06.709
where, let me set up

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.984
a little table here.

00:03:08.984 --> 00:03:10.540
So, a little table,

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.510
so if this is n and this is h of n,

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:15.857
so n is zero,

00:03:15.857 --> 00:03:17.529
we don't know what h of zero is just yet,

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:18.574
it's going to be a.

00:03:18.574 --> 00:03:22.149
We don't know what h of 1 is yet.

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:26.352
We do know that h of 2 is 144.

00:03:26.352 --> 00:03:29.162
And we do know, since
the common ratio is 3/2,

00:03:29.162 --> 00:03:33.179
if we take h of 1 and
we multiply it by 3/2,

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:35.175
we're going to get h of 2,

00:03:35.175 --> 00:03:38.240
and if we take h of zero
and multiply it by 3/2,

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.701
we're going to get h of 1.

00:03:40.701 --> 00:03:45.136
So, h of 1 is going to
be 144 divided by 3/2.

00:03:45.136 --> 00:03:45.949
So let's write that down.

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:49.246
H of 1 is equal to 144

00:03:49.246 --> 00:03:52.450
divided by 3/2,

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.165
which is going to be 144,

00:03:56.165 --> 00:04:00.530
144 times 2 over 3,

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:01.297
and let's see,

00:04:01.297 --> 00:04:05.639
144 divided by 3 is

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:08.170
going to be equal to,

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.330
is it,

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.841
let's see,

00:04:09.841 --> 00:04:11.699
one 3 goes into,

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:12.535
I'll just do this by hand,

00:04:12.535 --> 00:04:14.276
my brain doesn't work that well

00:04:14.276 --> 00:04:15.460
while I'm making videos.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.502
3 goes into 14 four times,

00:04:18.502 --> 00:04:19.756
4 times 3 is 12,

00:04:19.756 --> 00:04:20.731
subtract,

00:04:20.731 --> 00:04:22.147
so it's going to be,

00:04:22.147 --> 00:04:24.372
I see, it's going to be 48.

00:04:24.372 --> 00:04:26.113
3 goes into 24 eight times.

00:04:26.113 --> 00:04:27.274
8 times 3 is 24,

00:04:27.274 --> 00:04:28.899
you have no remainder,

00:04:28.899 --> 00:04:30.455
so,

00:04:30.455 --> 00:04:34.751
this is going to be 48 times 2,

00:04:34.751 --> 00:04:37.189
which is going to be equal to 96

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:38.953
so this is going to be 96,

00:04:38.953 --> 00:04:40.602
and so if we want to figure out h of zero,

00:04:40.602 --> 00:04:42.831
we just divide by 3/2 again,

00:04:42.831 --> 00:04:46.778
so, h of zero is 96

00:04:46.778 --> 00:04:49.588
divided by 3/2

00:04:49.588 --> 00:04:54.046
which is equal to 96 times 2 over 3.

00:04:54.046 --> 00:04:56.507
96 divided by 3, let's see,

00:04:56.507 --> 00:04:57.900
it's going to be 32,

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.290
so this is going to be 32

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.124
times, did I do that right?

00:05:03.124 --> 00:05:04.680
Yup, 32 times 2

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.513
which is equal to 64.

00:05:07.513 --> 00:05:08.975
64.

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:10.740
And so, just like that,
we've figured out that a

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.108
is equal to 64,

00:05:13.108 --> 00:05:15.059
and r,

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:18.054
and r is equal to 3/2.

00:05:18.054 --> 00:05:20.097
So we can write h of n,

00:05:20.097 --> 00:05:24.648
we can say that h of n is equal to 64,

00:05:24.648 --> 00:05:28.061
is equal to 64

00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:30.982
times 3/2,

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.657
times 3/2,

00:05:33.657 --> 00:05:34.934
our common ratio,

00:05:34.934 --> 00:05:37.117
to the nth power.

00:05:37.117 --> 00:05:38.858
Now, there's another way that
we could have tackled this

00:05:38.858 --> 00:05:40.484
instead of this tabular method.

00:05:40.484 --> 00:05:42.991
We could have just solved for a now,

00:05:42.991 --> 00:05:43.966
since we know r.

00:05:43.966 --> 00:05:45.777
We know, for example,

00:05:45.777 --> 00:05:49.237
we know for example that h of 2

00:05:49.237 --> 00:05:53.300
which is going to be equal to a times,

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.088
we know what our common ratio is,

00:05:55.088 --> 00:05:56.969
it's 3/2

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:59.361
to the 2nd power,

00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:03.424
is going to be equal to 144.

00:06:03.424 --> 00:06:07.603
And so, we could say a times 9 over 4

00:06:07.603 --> 00:06:10.297
is equal to 144,

00:06:10.297 --> 00:06:12.479
and so we can multiply both
sides times the reciprocal

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:13.362
of 9 over 4,

00:06:13.362 --> 00:06:16.682
so we multiply both sides times 4 over 9,

00:06:16.682 --> 00:06:19.445
times 4 over 9,

00:06:19.445 --> 00:06:20.327
and that cancels with that,

00:06:20.327 --> 00:06:21.744
that cancels with that,

00:06:21.744 --> 00:06:23.671
and we are left with

00:06:23.671 --> 00:06:25.993
a is equal to, well let's see,

00:06:25.993 --> 00:06:29.174
144 divided by 9

00:06:29.174 --> 00:06:31.356
is going to be,

00:06:31.356 --> 00:06:35.559
is going to be, I want
to say it's equal to 16?

00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:37.997
Is that right?

00:06:37.997 --> 00:06:39.181
I think that is right.

00:06:39.181 --> 00:06:40.574
Yup, and then 16 times 4,

00:06:40.574 --> 00:06:43.453
so this is going to be 16 and 1,

00:06:43.453 --> 00:06:46.495
16 times 4 is 64,

00:06:46.495 --> 00:06:48.492
which is exactly what we got before,

00:06:48.492 --> 00:06:49.560
and so this actually,

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.698
this method, now that I look at it,

00:06:50.698 --> 00:06:53.298
is actually a good bit easier,

00:06:53.298 --> 00:06:53.972
but they're equivalent,

00:06:53.972 --> 00:06:55.829
and I like this one because
you get to see the common

00:06:55.829 --> 00:06:58.499
ratio in action, and you get
to see that the initial value

00:06:58.499 --> 00:06:59.776
is the initial value.

00:06:59.776 --> 00:07:01.541
It is h of zero,

00:07:01.541 --> 00:07:02.470
but either way,

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:03.445
once you figure out r,

00:07:03.445 --> 00:07:05.860
and you know one of the

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:06.765
h of,

00:07:06.765 --> 00:07:08.855
you know what the function is at a value,

00:07:08.855 --> 00:07:10.271
you can solve for a,

00:07:10.271 --> 00:07:11.711
and frankly, if you
knew a and you knew what

00:07:11.711 --> 00:07:13.104
the function was for a given n,

00:07:13.104 --> 00:07:15.983
you could likewise solve for r.

00:07:15.983 --> 00:07:18.253
So hopefully you enjoyed that.
