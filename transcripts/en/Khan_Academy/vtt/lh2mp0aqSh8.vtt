00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:01.338
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.338 --> 00:00:02.873
is give ourselves practice

00:00:02.873 --> 00:00:05.727
representing fractions that
you're gonna see a lot in life

00:00:05.727 --> 00:00:07.247
in different ways.

00:00:07.247 --> 00:00:10.562
So the first fraction we're
going to explore is 1/5

00:00:10.562 --> 00:00:13.793
then we're going to explore 1/4

00:00:13.793 --> 00:00:18.231
then we are going to explore 1/2.

00:00:18.231 --> 00:00:20.111
So let's start with 1/5.

00:00:20.111 --> 00:00:22.076
So I encourage you to
pause the video and say

00:00:22.076 --> 00:00:26.243
and think about how would you
represent 1/5 as a decimal.

00:00:27.592 --> 00:00:30.250
Well, there's a bunch of ways
that you could think about it.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.028
You could divide five into one.

00:00:33.028 --> 00:00:37.195
You could say that this is
equal to one divided by five

00:00:37.195 --> 00:00:39.525
and if you did that, you actually
would get the right answer

00:00:39.525 --> 00:00:41.324
but there's a simpler way
of thinking about this

00:00:41.324 --> 00:00:42.836
even in your head.

00:00:42.836 --> 00:00:44.630
You could say, well, let me
see if I can represent this

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.837
as a certain number of tenths

00:00:46.837 --> 00:00:48.145
'cause if you know how many tenths,

00:00:48.145 --> 00:00:50.429
we know how to represent
that as a decimal.

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:53.008
Well, to go from fifths to tenths,

00:00:53.008 --> 00:00:56.036
you have to multiply
the denominator by two.

00:00:56.036 --> 00:00:59.409
So let's multiply the
numerator by two as well.

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:04.031
So 1/5, one times two is
the same thing as 2/10

00:01:04.031 --> 00:01:06.210
and we know how to represent
that in decimal notation.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.296
That's going to be 0.2.

00:01:08.296 --> 00:01:09.646
This is the tenths place.

00:01:09.646 --> 00:01:13.388
So we have exactly 2/10.

00:01:13.388 --> 00:01:14.613
Now, let's do 1/4.

00:01:14.613 --> 00:01:15.800
Same idea.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.189
How could I represent this as a decimal?

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:20.180
Well, at first, you might say,

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.765
well, can I represent this
as a certain number of tenths

00:01:23.765 --> 00:01:25.908
and you could do it this way

00:01:25.908 --> 00:01:28.693
but 10 isn't a multiple of four

00:01:28.693 --> 00:01:30.821
so let's see if we can do
it in terms of hundredths

00:01:30.821 --> 00:01:33.455
'cause 100 is a multiple of four.

00:01:33.455 --> 00:01:37.459
Well, to go from four to 100,
you have to multiply by 25.

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:39.714
So let's multiply the numerator by 25

00:01:39.714 --> 00:01:41.596
to get an equivalent fraction.

00:01:41.596 --> 00:01:43.429
So one times 25 is 25.

00:01:44.631 --> 00:01:47.375
So 1/4 is equal to 25/100

00:01:47.375 --> 00:01:49.877
and we can represent
that in decimal notation

00:01:49.877 --> 00:01:53.876
as 25/100 which we could also consider

00:01:53.876 --> 00:01:57.080
2/10 and 5/100.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.302
Now, let's do 1/2.

00:01:58.302 --> 00:01:59.635
Same exact idea.

00:02:00.781 --> 00:02:02.633
Well, 10 is a multiple of two

00:02:02.633 --> 00:02:05.451
so we can think about
this in terms of tenths.

00:02:05.451 --> 00:02:09.416
So to go from two to
10, we multiply by five.

00:02:09.416 --> 00:02:12.152
So let's multiply the
numerator by five as well.

00:02:12.152 --> 00:02:15.459
So 1/2 is equal to 5/10

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.626
which if you wanna represent
as a decimal is 0.5, 5/10.

00:02:21.553 --> 00:02:23.274
Now, why is this useful?

00:02:23.274 --> 00:02:25.358
Well, one, you're gonna
see these fractions

00:02:25.358 --> 00:02:27.441
show up a lot in life and
you're gonna go both ways.

00:02:27.441 --> 00:02:30.054
If you see 2/10 or 20/100

00:02:30.054 --> 00:02:32.222
to be able to immediately
recognize, hey, that's 1/5

00:02:32.222 --> 00:02:36.367
or 25/100, hey, that's
1/4 or 1/4, that's 25/100.

00:02:36.367 --> 00:02:40.200
1/2 is 0.5 or 0.5 is 1/2

00:02:41.223 --> 00:02:45.178
and it's not just useful
for these three fractions.

00:02:45.178 --> 00:02:46.817
It's useful for things that are multiple

00:02:46.817 --> 00:02:48.450
of these three fractions.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.450
For example, if someone said, quick,

00:02:52.483 --> 00:02:56.251
what is 3/5 represented as a decimal?

00:02:56.251 --> 00:02:57.316
Well, in your brain, you could say,

00:02:57.316 --> 00:03:00.878
well, 3/5, that's just
going to be three times 1/5

00:03:00.878 --> 00:03:03.576
and I know that 1/5 is 2/10

00:03:03.576 --> 00:03:07.145
so that's gonna be three times 2/10

00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:10.047
which is, well, three times two is six

00:03:10.047 --> 00:03:12.827
so three times 2/10 is 6/10.

00:03:12.827 --> 00:03:14.369
So really quick, you're able to say,

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:16.127
hey, that's 3/5 is 6/10

00:03:16.127 --> 00:03:17.761
and you could have gone
the other way around.

00:03:17.761 --> 00:03:21.928
You could have said 6/10
is equal to two times,

00:03:23.728 --> 00:03:26.978
is equal to three times 2/10

00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:30.752
and 2/10 is 1/5.

00:03:30.752 --> 00:03:33.941
So this is gonna be
equal to three times 1/5

00:03:33.941 --> 00:03:35.280
and once again, these are just things

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.676
that you'll get comfortable with

00:03:36.676 --> 00:03:39.020
the more that you get practice.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.064
Let's do another one.

00:03:41.064 --> 00:03:43.271
Let's say you wanted to represent,

00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:45.027
let's say you wanted to represent,

00:03:45.027 --> 00:03:46.266
let me do it another way.

00:03:46.266 --> 00:03:47.849
0.75 as a fraction.

00:03:49.744 --> 00:03:52.646
Pause the video, try to do it yourself.

00:03:52.646 --> 00:03:55.424
Well, you might immediately
recognize that 75

00:03:55.424 --> 00:03:58.740
is three times 25 so 75/100

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.827
is equal to three times 25/100

00:04:02.827 --> 00:04:05.982
and 25/100 we already know is 1/4

00:04:05.982 --> 00:04:09.005
so this is equal to three times 1/4

00:04:09.005 --> 00:04:12.357
which is equal to 3/4 and over time,

00:04:12.357 --> 00:04:13.825
you won't have to do all
of this in your head.

00:04:13.825 --> 00:04:16.479
You'll just recognize 75/100, that's 3/4

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.420
because 25/100 is 1/4

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.962
and now let's do, let's say we have,

00:04:22.962 --> 00:04:24.712
let's say we have 2.5

00:04:26.407 --> 00:04:29.748
and we wanna represent that as a fraction.

00:04:29.748 --> 00:04:31.587
Well, there's a bunch of
ways that you could do this.

00:04:31.587 --> 00:04:35.170
You could say, well,
this is five times 0.5

00:04:37.107 --> 00:04:40.827
and that's going to be five times 1/2.

00:04:40.827 --> 00:04:43.689
Well, that's going to be 5/2.

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:46.132
It's an improper fraction
but it's a fraction.

00:04:46.132 --> 00:04:47.485
And so once again, the whole point here

00:04:47.485 --> 00:04:48.847
and you might already be familiar

00:04:48.847 --> 00:04:50.195
with the different ways of converting

00:04:50.195 --> 00:04:52.817
between fractions and decimals

00:04:52.817 --> 00:04:56.195
but if you recognize 1/5, 1/4, 1/2,

00:04:56.195 --> 00:04:57.585
it's going to be a lot easier.

00:04:57.585 --> 00:04:59.345
Notice if you did it the other way around

00:04:59.345 --> 00:05:00.654
it'd be a little bit more work.

00:05:00.654 --> 00:05:04.210
If I said, let me
convert 3/5 to a decimal,

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.114
well, then you would have
to divide five into three.

00:05:07.114 --> 00:05:08.794
Five into three and you'd say, okay,

00:05:08.794 --> 00:05:13.023
five goes into three zero times
so let's put a decimal here.

00:05:13.023 --> 00:05:14.081
Now, let's go to 30.

00:05:14.081 --> 00:05:16.208
Five goes into 30 six times.

00:05:16.208 --> 00:05:18.556
Six times five is 30.

00:05:18.556 --> 00:05:22.351
You subtract and then
you get no remainder.

00:05:22.351 --> 00:05:25.546
So this wasn't a ton of work but this one,

00:05:25.546 --> 00:05:26.486
the reason why I like this one,

00:05:26.486 --> 00:05:29.610
not only is it faster but it
gives you a better intuition

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.110
for what actually is going on.
