DON DODGE: Hi.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.850
I'm Don Dodge.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.030
And this is Google Root Access.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.140
Today my guess is Jay Simons,
president of the Atlassian.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.300
Jay, we had you here last week
to talk about the enterprise

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.300
software model and
how that worked.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.672
Great show.

00:00:20.672 --> 00:00:22.380
Wanted to invite you
back again this week

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.620
to talk about how Atlassian
started, because it's

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.580
quite an interesting story.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.904
So, started in 2002
in Sydney, Australia.

00:00:31.904 --> 00:00:32.570
JAY SIMONS: Yep.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.580
2002, Sidney, Australia.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.560
I wasn't actually
there at the time.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.640
My accent betrays that probably.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.710
The two founders, both
engineers, both developers,

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.550
and actually the
beginning of the company

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.790
they were supporting an open
source application server

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.120
call Orion.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.054
And they were doing technical
support for that product,

00:00:52.054 --> 00:00:53.970
and actually doing
customization for customers

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:54.761
all over the world.

00:00:54.761 --> 00:00:58.040
And they, I think at the time,
were using an open source issue

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.930
tracker, Bugzilla, and
became frustrated with it.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.030
And so built their own.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.161
And like most software startups,
shared it with their friends.

00:01:06.161 --> 00:01:08.660
And their friends-- who were
developers in other companies--

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.000
said, man, I would love to
use that instead of Bugzilla

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.580
or Tracker, whatever I
was using at the time.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.314
And they said,
why then would you

00:01:16.314 --> 00:01:17.480
pay for something like that?

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.230
Of course I would.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.960
So in the early days, they
went from in their network

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.460
of people, and they were pretty
active in the Java community

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.080
at the time, their network
of other developers

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.680
and other companies and had
heard just a resounding need

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.360
for something like JIRA.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.860
And JIRA was that first product.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.030
And so they did
the famous pivot,

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.380
and moved from, effectively,
a service and support

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.960
company to a software company
in the early beginnings.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.750
They had a product
that actually had legs.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.720
And so that was the
beginning of Atlassian.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.170
DON DODGE: So it
started from day one,

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.360
charging a subscription for the
product, right from day one.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.420
JAY SIMONS: We charged
licensing the software.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.420
In the early days, it
wasn't available in cloud.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.336
It was just something
that you install therein

00:02:04.336 --> 00:02:05.240
in your own servers.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.180
And it was licensed.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.509
It was somewhere between
$1,000 and $5,000,

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:11.550
depending on the edition.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.240
But it was intentionally
priced to be very affordable.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.362
And if you think about
where they started,

00:02:16.362 --> 00:02:17.320
they started in Sidney.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.940
And they realized actually
that most of the market

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.990
is an ocean away from then.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.245
And they had a choice
to either hire people

00:02:27.245 --> 00:02:29.120
in each of those markets
and try to represent

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.536
the software, the company,
that they were trying to build,

00:02:31.536 --> 00:02:34.180
or figure out whether they
could use the internet

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.530
to reach those customers
in foreign markets

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.280
and other markets.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.620
And they chose the latter.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.300
And it was a pretty
methodical approach

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.680
to building one brick
on top of another

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.200
and figuring out how could, A,
how could they build awareness

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.360
for the company and the
product, how could they

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.193
reach those markets,
and then how could they

00:02:52.193 --> 00:02:54.670
enable those customers to
try the product themselves

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.800
and then buy it if
they deem that it

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.450
was suitable for the job.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.450
DON DODGE: So many
founders today

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.190
believe they need to
be in Silicon Valley

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.550
to start a company.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.640
And Atlassian was started
in Sydney, Australia.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.610
Many founders believe
that they need

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.530
to give the product away or have
some type of a freemium model

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.610
to get started.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.780
But Atlassian glassy and started
with a straight up license.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.920
Do you think you could
do the same thing today

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.380
in today's environment?

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.352
JAY SIMONS: I absolutely
think you can.

00:03:27.352 --> 00:03:28.810
There's a lot of
examples, I think,

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.290
of companies that start
today without freemium

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.940
but are affordable.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.500
And I think you need to think
very carefully about pricing,

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.000
right?

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.410
If pricing is very high,
it's a barrier, right?

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.827
It's an obstacle
that you're going

00:03:39.827 --> 00:03:42.410
to have to figure out a way to
convince your customers to jump

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.190
over with you.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.604
Oftentimes, companies
do that with sales.

00:03:45.604 --> 00:03:47.020
And sales works
to do that, right?

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.853
You can understand a
customer's paying point

00:03:48.853 --> 00:03:51.480
and have a conversation
about whether or not

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.980
you can solve it, and
understand whether or not

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.951
they're willing to do a
value exchange for what

00:03:56.951 --> 00:03:57.950
you want to charge that.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.420
And that works, tried and true.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.550
But you could also very early
days in very early beginnings

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.480
figure out whether or not you
can build a pricing model that

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.980
reduces the that friction
point or that obstacle

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:10.944
for your customers.

00:04:10.944 --> 00:04:12.360
And you need to
be careful to make

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.350
sure that that model
scales in the way

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.089
that you want it to over time.

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.910
And maybe that's hard, right?

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.420
Because it's, in some cases,
you are making some assumptions.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.115
And my only advice is be
careful about the assumptions

00:04:26.115 --> 00:04:27.490
that you make and
think about how

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.580
you'd want to scale
them over two or three

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.955
or four years from
now, if you're

00:04:30.955 --> 00:04:33.116
successful at a
lower entry point.

00:04:33.116 --> 00:04:35.240
DON DODGE: So Atlassian is
really an amazing story,

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.220
because you broke all the rules.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.850
You didn't come to Silicon
Valley, started in Sydney.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.960
You didn't do a freemium
model or give away.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.770
You charged a
license right away.

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.030
You didn't raise
venture capital.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.352
You were able to bootstrap
and become cash flow positive.

00:04:54.352 --> 00:04:55.560
Talk about that a little bit.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.997
How were you able to be cash
flow positive and still grow?

00:05:01.997 --> 00:05:04.580
JAY SIMONS: Well, if you think
about when the company started,

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:05.080
it was 2002.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.820
So it was right after
the dot com crash.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.360
So it was probably
very difficult for two

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.860
technical founders in Sydney,
Australia to raise money

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:13.730
and to begin with.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.034
And so, their option was, well,
let's just do it on our own.

00:05:17.034 --> 00:05:19.700
I mean, they probably could have
tried to come to Silicon Valley

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.560
and raise money in
an environment that

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.810
really wasn't conducive to it.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.184
Or they could just roll up
their sleeves and get to work.

00:05:25.184 --> 00:05:26.660
And so that's why
they chose to do.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.112
So, took out a line of
credit on a credit card

00:05:29.112 --> 00:05:31.570
and, you know, bootstraps,
where they didn't pay themselves

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:32.730
a lot of money.

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.910
They worked
incredibly long hours.

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:39.314
They built a product that
they felt they was something

00:05:39.314 --> 00:05:40.980
that they could build
a business around.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.938
They validated that with
their early customers.

00:05:42.938 --> 00:05:45.580
And then they just kept on
building the business one

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.590
hand after another.

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.706
And when they started
to make money,

00:05:50.706 --> 00:05:53.330
they put the money back into the
business versus their own bank

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.210
accounts.

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:55.200
They were very frugal.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.270
I think the DNA
of the company is

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.140
to be very, very
conscious about spending

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:00.640
and think about
return, and think

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.890
about building a business that's
going to be here 5, 10, 15, 50

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.100
years from now, versus
one that you're just

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.190
going to build for today.

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.670
And I think that DNA,
because of our two founds,

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:14.870
it permeates through
the business even today.

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.500
DON DODGE: And then
the fourth accepted

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.960
practice, stock options
for employees, Atlassian

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.400
didn't offer stock
options either.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.910
JAY SIMONS: Not until 2010.

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.964
And largely that was because
in Australia, there's

00:06:27.964 --> 00:06:29.880
a different association
with equity than there

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.220
that's typical than the
value Australians actually

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.810
are taxed a grant.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.100
And so in some ways, there's
a negative association

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.600
with equity.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.099
You're saying, hey,
here's something

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:40.450
that is potentially
not worth anything.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:44.045
But it has a value today
that you have to pay tax on.

00:06:44.045 --> 00:06:45.920
And so I'm giving you
something that actually

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.836
is going to cost you
money out of your pocket.

00:06:47.836 --> 00:06:49.510
And it's very uncommon there.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:53.600
And that's just culturally
it wasn't really accepted.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.175
And which is why
we didn't have it.

00:06:55.175 --> 00:06:55.800
DON DODGE: Wow.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.870
So there's four things
that startups typically

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.800
do in Silicon Valley
when they start.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.980
And Atlassian did none of them.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:09.120
So maybe starting in Australia
and starting with that mindset

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.020
was actually an advantage
that people or founders

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.650
in Silicon Valley don't have.

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.120
JAY SIMONS: I absolutely
think it's an advantage.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.180
I think it was an
advantage for us.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.340
Like, it can be an advantage.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.070
I mean. there's
tons of companies.

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.890
If you look like Rovio is
a great company that I like

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:25.640
to use in example, in Helsinki,
that built Angry Nerds.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.820
And again I think there are
numerous examples of companies

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.110
that spring out of whatever
environment they're in.

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.400
And I think that environment is
a petri dish to do new things

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.110
and break conventions.

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:41.950
DON DODGE: So eight years
of profitability and growth

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:46.060
from 2002 didn't raise any
venture capital no stock

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:50.660
options fully licensed
and now subscription.

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.130
And then in 2010, a big change.

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:56.710
You raise $60 million
of venture capital.

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:58.240
That's a pretty big shift.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.574
So what went into that decision?

00:07:59.574 --> 00:08:01.115
JAY SIMONS: So we'd
just gone through

00:08:01.115 --> 00:08:02.720
the 2009 global
financial crisis.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.460
And made a couple
of big decisions

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.920
just to swing for the
fences coming out of that.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.100
So when everyone
else was downsizing,

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.660
we ended up growing by 50%.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.400
And we did this
big hiring binge.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.780
When everyone else was worried
about maintaining growth,

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:23.150
we actually made the entry
point for our products

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:24.200
free at that time.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.840
So we could make it more
affordable for companies

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.530
in the pension 2009.

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:30.539
And then I thought, we
thought, very carefully

00:08:30.539 --> 00:08:32.330
about the business that
we wanted to build,

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.829
and decided that we wanted to
build a company that was going

00:08:34.829 --> 00:08:37.782
to be here growing and
a venerable concern 50

00:08:37.782 --> 00:08:38.490
years from today.

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:40.781
We wanted to be the next
Oracle, or the Salesforce.com,

00:08:40.781 --> 00:08:43.350
or replace those two companies.

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:45.719
And when you think about
what that journey entails,

00:08:45.719 --> 00:08:48.010
you plot out a couple of
gates you want to run through.

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:52.000
And I think one of them
is to be a public company.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.350
If you back up from
that, to go there

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:57.277
we probably should
have an early investor,

00:08:57.277 --> 00:08:59.610
somebody's who's going to
partner with us over the three

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:01.443
years, ramping up to
that point or the years

00:09:01.443 --> 00:09:02.500
ramping up to that point.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.340
And so we decided
to basically take

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.410
an investor and a partner
who would help build

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:11.440
the business over the
next 3 to 50 years.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.840
DON DODGE: So Atlassian
has been contrarian almost

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:14.780
from the beginning.

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:19.020
All of the accepted beliefs
of how you build a company,

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:22.510
Atlassian went against the
grain almost every time.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:25.980
And the last example,
raising $60 million in 2010

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.440
when everyone else
was hunkering down

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.190
and trying to recover
from the financial crisis,

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:34.630
you're out there raising
money and hiring people.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:35.989
So what's next?

00:09:35.989 --> 00:09:38.030
JAY SIMONS: Yeah, you
know, the concerning thing,

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:39.880
it could another--
what do they say,

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.790
they say the toilets spin the
other direction in Australia,

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:44.740
and maybe it has
something to do with that?

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:47.000
What's next for us?

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.470
We're continuing just
to focus on growth.

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:51.480
And we announced,
I think, a couple

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:55.240
of really exciting products
recently, one JIRA Service

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:59.220
Desk, which expands the
market that we can support

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.860
for collaboration beyond
software teams to IT teams.

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:05.050
I think that's an important
and big, bold move for us.

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:10.450
We also announced an enterprise
Quora confluence questions,

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:14.220
which is an Enterprise-grade
Q&amp;A product that I think

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:17.020
takes the pattern that Quora
and Stack Overflow have

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:19.940
demonstrated on the internet
and provides that to customers.

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.320
And so I think there's a
number of exciting new product

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:22.890
initiatives.

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:27.600
And we've got 30,000
active customers now,

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.440
and I think there's
hundreds to millions

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.190
more that we could go support.

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:33.900
And that's what we're chasing.

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.330
DON DODGE: So another example.

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:38.620
Quora and Stack
Overflow are free.

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.690
And I suspect that
your product is

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:42.462
a paid license or subscription?

00:10:42.462 --> 00:10:44.670
JAY SIMONS: It is, although
neither of those products

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.300
are really used by enterprises.

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:48.210
And so we're a business
software company,

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:50.567
where we're taking, I
think, great patterns that

00:10:50.567 --> 00:10:52.400
exist on the internet
or just in open source

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.025
or just in commercial
source and trying

00:10:54.025 --> 00:10:57.797
to make better experiences
that are more affordable

00:10:57.797 --> 00:10:59.380
and provide better
value to customers.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:01.145
And that's sort of the
DNA of the company.

00:11:01.145 --> 00:11:01.770
DON DODGE: Wow.

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:03.250
An amazing story.

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:05.900
So thank you very
much for joining us.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.550
