00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Following along from the last problem, we can show that Hamiltonian cycle is

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
actually NP-complete, and we can show this from a reduction from shortest tour

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
to Hamiltonian cycle.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
To show this, let's say every edge for shortest tour has a cost,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
or an edge length, of 1.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Then, we can say that a shortest tour for a given graph with n vertices

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
has a given length if and only if the graph has a Hamiltonian cycle.

00:00:29.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And what I'd like you to do is give me this length that completes this.
