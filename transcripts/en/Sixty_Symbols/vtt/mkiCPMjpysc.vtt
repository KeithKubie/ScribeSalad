00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.480
So, well, the simple version is just to tell you what the terms in the equation mean

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.940
which is that E means energy, and that's equal to m, mass, times c,

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:09.800
the speed of light, squared.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.140
Energy can be measured in joules, mass of a particle could be measured in kilograms.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.060
so if you've going to relate them, you have to relate them with some factor

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.560
and the factor that does it is this...

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.320
square of the speed of light.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.520
Taken at face value, it means that energy is equivalent to mass

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.160
so that if you were to look at Newton's laws of motion and say that masses attract

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.200
this now implies that energy is attracted by another mass.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.460
So, if a light wave with energy goes near a planet or the sun, it's actually bent by it

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.300
because it's attracted. So it's saying that energy is equivalent to mass.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.160
The consequence of it is quite dramatic, because the speed of light squared is a huge number.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.680
The speed of light in meters per second is...

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.180
... Uh... three times ten to the eight (power). Three hundred million meters per second.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.220
You square that, and you've got...

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:04.360
... Uh...

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.440
... Oh, rubbish...

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.900
... nine times ten to the sixteenth. So, you've got an order of ten to the seventeeth as a conversion factor.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.300
So, a very small amount of mass

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.140
is equivalent to a hugh amount of energy.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.760
In physical terms, what it means is that there's actually an energy associated with mass.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.120
It's something that just sort of falls out, sort of almost automatically from special relativity.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.260
That is just something that comes out of the equations.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.040
But, obviously, it's an incredibly powerful result, because it basically means that whenever you've got a mass

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.180
you have a source of energy.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.100
And, so, you know, if you...

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.860
have a... fusion bomb, for example, you actually convert some of that mass directly into energy.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.840
But it basically is another way of saying that mass is just a way of storing energy.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.560
But it's not even the right equation!

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.220
The proper equation is E squared equals m squared (times) c to the fourth

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.600
plus another term involving the momentum, which is an extra p squared (times) c squared.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.360
The mass in E equals m (times) c squared can either be the rest mass,

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.060
and that's what is usually thought of, that's where the object isn't moving,

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.780
and so it's actually just got an intrinsic mass, and so it's got an intrinsic energy associated with it,

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.700
or, it could be what's known as the relativistic mass.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.060
And if it's the relativistic mass, then it's including the momentum

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.820
and I think I'm probably agreeing with Roger.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:35.560
In the textbooks you often see the bare masses; m with a little subscript zero beside it

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.100
just to make it clear that that's not including the momentum of the particle.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.560
The whole equation is never explained because people like you don't want us to write down equations

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.240
'cause they're boring *pretends to yawn*.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.180
But if you do it properly,  that's what it is. And if you don't do it properly

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.280
then you can't explain why energy is attracted to (mass), gravitating to objects,

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.560
nor can you explain how a photon, which doesn't have any mass, behaves the way it does.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.380
I think an interesting aspect is, why is it the squared speed of light?

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.560
Why isn't it the square of the speed of sound, which is a much lower number?

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.380
For that you have to look at what Einstein did

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.240
when he was coming up with this theory of special relativity.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.360
Without any extra work, it sorta falls out of the analysis of special relativity,

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.560
that's just a result that comes along.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.860
And, it's very nice when you just get a result that just sort of falls out without any extra work

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.700
but actually, on its own, has huge, amazing implications for the laws of physics.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.540
The people I have spoken to, and when I gave public talks, the people who attended,

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.580
certainly have an idea that you've got energy and mass.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:50.520
I don't think they often realized quite how significant it is, and quite how broad that equation is

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.160
at explaining phenomena that we experience.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:59.060
They just tend to think of it in the world of particle physics, or something rather extreme.

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.400
But, in fact, it accounts for the binding of atoms.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.000
If you've got the constituents of atoms, and you just measure that mass

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.500
then you put them together, the mass drops.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.060
And the mass drops because of the binding energy, and the thing that explains that binding energy

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.680
is E equals m (times) c squared.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.580
The correct equation, even if the momentum is zero,

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.260
is E squared equals m squared (times) c to the fourth.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.100
And if you take the square root of that, you can get negative energies coming out.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.420
And Dirac noticed this, and interpreted the negative energy states as the antiparticles.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.140
So you now get something for nothing. If you use the correct equation, you can take the square root,

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.520
come out with a negative energy solution, and then interpret it in quantum mechanics as the antiparticle.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.640
And he predicted this well before anybody did the experiment that discovered the positron.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.740
So, the proper equation is much richer.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.900
The public can't cope with anything more complicated than E equals m (times) c squared

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.880
and even that's so full of meaning.
