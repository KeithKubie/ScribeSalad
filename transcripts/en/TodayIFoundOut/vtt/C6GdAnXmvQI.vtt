00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.720
These days, Super Bowl halftime shows are
star-studded affairs that can eclipse the

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.800
game itself.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.720
More people watched Madonna’s 2012 halftime
performance than the Patriots and Giants matchup

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.760
(despite it being thrilling).

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.340
In 2007, everyone remembers Prince crooning
“Purple Rain” during an actual torrential

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.340
rainstorm.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.130
Also, the Indianapolis Colts beat the Chicago
Bears in a rather uneventful game.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.700
In 1993, the King of Pop Michael Jackson staged
a legendary halftime performance that cemented

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.700
his and football’s status as American cultural
icons.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.160
Few recall that the Dallas Cowboys destroyed
the Buffalo Bills that year by a score of

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.590
53 to 17.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.519
(Incidentally, this fourth consecutive loss
in the Super Bowl by the Bills, nonetheless,

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:50.420
was a win for the world in helping to popularize
the Buffalo Wing– now a staple food item

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.100
of any good Super Bowl party.)

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.229
Until Michael Jackson in 1993, pop stars really
didn’t perform at the Super Bowl.

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:58.880
But it didn’t mean the halftime show was
boring.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.520
Here’s the story of the first Super Bowl
halftime show, which featured jetpacks, 300

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.600
pigeons and a weird old west shootout.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.940
In 1959, the American Football League (AFL)
formed to compete with the emerging National

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.180
Football League (NFL).

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.630
With many teams from the west and south (like
the Los Angeles Chargers, Houston Oilers and

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.220
Kansas City Chiefs), the AFL emphasized a
more pass-heavy game than the NFL.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.140
The league also came up with fan-friendly
innovations that are still seen in sports

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.040
today, like putting names on the back of uniforms
and two-point conversations.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.690
By 1966, it became clear that the AFL could
potentially pass the NFL as the country’s

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:37.800
premier football league.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.280
So, the two leagues merged in June 1966 with
all eight AFL teams joining the NFL.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.850
It was also agreed that, although the two
leagues would not play each other in the regular

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.710
season, the two best teams would meet in a
championship game at the end of the year.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.150
Sort of half-jokingly, Chiefs’ owner Lamar
Hunt proposed they call it the “Super Bowl,”

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:14.459
at least until a better name was thought up.

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.830
Rather oddly, Super Bowl I actually wasn’t
officially known as that until two years after

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:19.830
the fact.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.319
On January 15, 1967, the AFL’s Kansas City
Chiefs and NFL’s the Green Bay Packers played

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.709
in a game that was originally billed as the
AFL-NFL World Championship in Los Angeles.

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.959
However, promotional materials and press mentioned
it as a “Super Bowl,” taking Hunt’s

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:35.959
suggestion.

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:41.439
But the NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle still
clung to the very uncatchy name of the “AFL-NFL

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:42.730
World Championship.”

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.290
Finally, in 1969, the commissioner relented
and officially renamed the championship game

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.120
the “Super Bowl,” while retroactively
naming the two games that were played under

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:58.060
the old moniker “Super Bowl I” and “Super
Bowl II.”

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.560
This brings us to the first Super Bowl halftime
show.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.370
Tommy Walker may not be as famous as other
Super Bowl heroes like Joe Namath, Whitney

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.379
Houston or Lynn Swann, but he perhaps had
more of an impact on what the big game has

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:12.029
since become than them.

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:16.330
Once known as “Tommy the Toe” for his
kicking acumen while at USC, Walker also was

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.220
an accomplished drummer and sometimes actor
who earned a Bronze Star as a scout for the

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.829
Army during World War II.

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:27.239
He was a natural showman who, as USC’s band
director, would put on halftime shows that

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.019
involved card stunts and pigeon releases.

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.090
His eccentric performances caught the attention
of another showman, Walt Disney, who hired

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.079
him to organize and direct the 1955 opening
ceremonies for his new theme park – Disneyland

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:40.139
– in Anaheim.

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:44.930
He’s credited with ­designing what has
since become iconic Disney theme park pageantry,

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.029
including Tinker Bell’s wire descent from
the Matterhorn and the fireworks above Cinderella’s

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:51.029
castle.

00:03:51.029 --> 00:03:54.790
According to Sports Illustrated, it was Walker
who convinced commissioner Rozelle that the

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.840
first championship game between the AFL and
NFL needed his own special brand of flair.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.090
The commissioner was reportedly at first reluctant
to spend the money because, as SI quoted him,

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.290
“Why would we spend all that money?

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.889
That’s when everybody goes to the bathroom.”

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:14.900
However, he was soon convinced and Walker
went to work.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.389
rocketIn his planning for the first Super
Bowl Halftime Show, Walker literally reached

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:20.389
for the sky.

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:24.220
Two years earlier, he had hired Bill Suitor
– perhaps the world’s foremost jet pack

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.150
pilot who had given himself the nickname “Mr.
Jetpack” – to soar over Disneyland.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.250
Now, Walker asked him to join him in entertaining
the football-watching crowd.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.850
Next, Walker reached out to more traditional
entertainment – two college marching bands,

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.330
one from the University of Arizona and another
from Grambling University.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.730
This was significant because Grambling was
a small Louisiana school and a historically

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:46.980
black college.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.980
At a time when racial tension was hanging
over America (especially in LA, where the

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.420
Watts riots had raged only a few months before),
this choice held symbolic meaning.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.390
Walker also got famous trumpeter Al Hirt to
perform for free with one condition: That

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.910
part of the show was a tribute to his beloved
New Orleans, who had just been awarded an

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.810
NFL team a few months earlier.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.920
As the two teams headed to the locker rooms
for halftime with the Packers leading the

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:15.200
Chiefs 14 to 10, the 200 person University
of Arizona marching band took the field at

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.950
the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for the
halftime show that was titled “Super Sights

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:20.950
and Sounds.”

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.540
Marching up the field, they were joined by
“world champion baton twirler Richard Smith”

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.200
who performed a quick routine.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.700
Next, the band shifted into the next stage
of the program, which was to pay tribute to

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.870
the four corners of the United States.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.870
Forming into a southern riverboat, they were
accompanied by Hirt, who played an assortment

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:43.420
of New Orleans-inspired solos while the band
formed again into a trumpet and musical notes.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:48.370
Next, to symbolize the west, they created
Arizona’s iconic OK corral while old west

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.470
gunman took aim at one another in recreating
the famous shootout between Wyatt Earp and

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:53.660
Doc Holliday and the McLaury brothers.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:54.660
(Though the popular perception of Earp and
Holliday isn’t exactly accurate today- see:

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:55.660
Wyatt Earp, the Great American Villain and
The Real Doc Holliday.)

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.450
There were blasts, gun smoke and, rather morbidly,
mortally wounded scattered across the field.

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:03.950
Moving on, the band acted out the “industry
in the north” with several actors stuffing

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:07.270
what looked to be big yellow coins into a
makeshift machine.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.910
Finally, they moved to the Mid-Atlantic region
and formed a giant liberty bell, which of

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:13.650
course, soon cracked.

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.860
The pageantry didn’t stop there, however,
with the marching band eventually forming

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.180
into two stick figure football players who
were to kick two giant footballs, symbolizing

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.060
the coming together of the two leagues.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.870
However, right before the footballs were to
be so-called “kicked,” out sprang the

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.210
jetpack-wearing Suitor and a partner.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.180
Flying high above the field, they landed in
the middle to great applause.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.860
After this, the Arizona band was joined by
Grambling University’s marching band to

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:42.170
create a giant map of the US, where each team
of the newly formed NFL was introduced to

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:43.170
the fans.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:47.550
Finally, the two bands were accompanied by
the USC song chorus for a rendition of “This

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:52.620
is My Country,” punctuated by the release
of thousands of multi-colored balloons and

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.240
300 pigeons.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.020
The nearly 15-minute performance was a cross
between a Disneyland parade, an Olympics opening

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.780
ceremonies and a college football halftime
performance.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:07.670
It was unlike anything anyone had ever seen
and set the stage for all Super Bowl Halftimes

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:19.500
Shows for years to come.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.670
And they didn’t need Michael Jackson or
U2 to make it memorable.
