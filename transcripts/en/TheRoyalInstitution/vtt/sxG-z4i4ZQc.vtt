00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.760
Oooh!

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:08.470
Can I try that?

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.320
I am using The Force!

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.140
Now, this is the closest I get to doing magic.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.540
But this isn't actually a trick, this is a demonstration of static electricity 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.160
and it's a really fun way

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.260
way of getting your children interested
in some really interesting phenomena.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.370
Now watch that, just an ordinary pencil.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.330
We balance it there, and rub it on this cloth.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.400
Are you going to pop it?

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.120
Well, I hope not.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.520
Now watch what happens to the pencil.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.040
Oooooh!

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.570
Isn't that cool?

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.760
Yeah, can I try that? Yeah, give it a rub, I'll hold the cloth for you.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.490
It's like you're pulling it round isn't it?

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.570
I could be using the force or something.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.980
Well, yes I think you are.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.510
When the balloon is rubbed against the
cloth

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.430
it becomes charged with static
electricity. When things are charged

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.820
with static electricity

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.130
they can attract or repel other things.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.500
If two things have opposite charges

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.790
they attract, or pull towards each other. If
two things have the same charge,

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.970
both positive or both negative, they
repel or push away from each other.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.120
It's a bit like the way that magnets can
attract or repel each other,

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.880
but static electricity is definitely not the same as magnetism.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.910
Look mum! It's attracting it. That's amazing Hector.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.370
It's actually attracting it.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.940
You can see lots of interesting effects
using static electricity,

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.500
here are charged balloon is attracting a
stream of water.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.780
The balloon has a negative charge and there are positive charges in the water,

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.210
which are attracted towards the balloon.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.870
It's the same with the pencil, there are
positive charges in the pencil

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.130
and these are attracted towards the negatively charged balloon.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.410
Everything contains electric charge, a mixture of positive and negative

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.690
and normally these cancel each other out.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.500
But when we rub the balloon with the cloth,

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.510
some the negative charge from the cloth rubs off on the balloon.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.160
The balloon gains a negative charge and the cloth is left with the positive charge.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.900
As you rub, tiny particles called electrons are rubbed off onto the balloon.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.300
Each electron has a negative charge and that's why the balloon becomes negatively charged.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.100
To do my so-called magic trick

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.720
what I did was charge the straw up first by rubbing it.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.370
And then, let it settle on the bottle.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:47.350
Then when I bring my hand up

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.610
the charge in the straw is attracted to the charge in my hand.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.920
And it starts to move towards my hand.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.420
And David Copperfield is in the room!

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.100
Oh, oh my gosh. Goodness!

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.960
They are almost flying aren't they!

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.740
Playing with static electricity is a genuinely magical thing to do if you've never tried it before,

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.460
and it's amazing to think that just
rubbing two things together 

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:22.590
can make these tiny electrons move from one object to another.

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.730
I've been amazed at something I
thought totally I knew and understood.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.979
All the different activities we've been able to explore 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:32.319
have genuinely fascinated me and my son.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
I am using The Force!
