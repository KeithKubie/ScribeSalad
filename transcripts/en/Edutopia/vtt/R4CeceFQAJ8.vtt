&gt;&gt;David: Traditional classrooms, the
kinds that I certainly grew up in,

00:00:06.116 --> 00:00:07.566
really don't reach every child.

00:00:07.946 --> 00:00:10.866
Not because of teachers, not because
of anything the teacher's doing

00:00:11.496 --> 00:00:14.866
so much as the actual
physical structure of the room.

00:00:16.056 --> 00:00:18.006
The idea that children
learn best by sitting

00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:22.026
in uniform rows facing the front
of the room, has been known

00:00:22.026 --> 00:00:27.006
to be ineffective for some learners
since the 1300s, as a famous painting

00:00:27.496 --> 00:00:30.556
that shows what a real
classroom looked

00:00:30.556 --> 00:00:31.956
like at the University of Bologna.

00:00:32.136 --> 00:00:34.806
And when you look at it, you laugh,
because there's students sleeping,

00:00:34.806 --> 00:00:37.746
there's students talking to each
other, and there's the poor professor

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:40.446
in the front of the room
trying to give a lecture hoping

00:00:40.446 --> 00:00:43.436
that everyone's learning something.

00:00:43.436 --> 00:00:47.136
So our motivation was to say if
the structure of the classroom is

00:00:47.136 --> 00:00:51.966
at fault, what new structures could
we design that might be better?

00:00:59.046 --> 00:01:00.576
&gt;&gt;David: My name's David Thornburg.

00:01:00.576 --> 00:01:03.856
And right now we're
located in Recife, Brazil.

00:01:04.416 --> 00:01:07.386
But we also live in the United
States, and we split our time

00:01:07.386 --> 00:01:09.946
between the two countries.

00:01:09.946 --> 00:01:14.646
My background is in science and
engineering, mathematics, education,

00:01:15.076 --> 00:01:17.826
and in particular, the role
that technology might play

00:01:18.316 --> 00:01:20.266
in support of students learning.

00:01:22.616 --> 00:01:25.486
The Holodeck, which takes its
name from science fiction,

00:01:26.096 --> 00:01:29.776
is basically an empty room that
can become anything you want

00:01:30.286 --> 00:01:32.486
when you turn the computers on.

00:01:32.486 --> 00:01:34.266
So walls, which are normally white,

00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:37.636
can suddenly become
viewports into outer space.

00:01:38.156 --> 00:01:41.546
They could become views
out of a submarine window.

00:01:41.766 --> 00:01:44.236
They could become almost
anything based

00:01:44.236 --> 00:01:47.196
on what the computer
software is telling it to do.

00:01:48.176 --> 00:01:49.976
The Holodeck is based on the idea

00:01:50.366 --> 00:01:52.286
of inquiry-driven,
project-based learning.

00:01:53.906 --> 00:01:57.016
They're actually engaged in
a mission, and the outcome

00:01:57.016 --> 00:01:58.276
of that mission is unclear.

00:01:58.276 --> 00:02:01.946
And a consequence of that is
the students are so engaged

00:02:02.516 --> 00:02:05.446
that they tend to remember what
they learned in that environment

00:02:05.526 --> 00:02:10.166
for a far longer period of time than
most kids remember their learning

00:02:10.166 --> 00:02:11.916
in a traditional classroom
environment.

00:02:14.236 --> 00:02:17.666
The first mission that we created was
a Mission to Mars to explore whether

00:02:17.666 --> 00:02:20.016
or not Mars has or had life.

00:02:21.256 --> 00:02:22.076
Interesting question.

00:02:22.306 --> 00:02:24.016
Scientists are unclear.

00:02:24.716 --> 00:02:29.506
I really like having students
explore things for which tools

00:02:29.506 --> 00:02:33.196
like Google can be a terrific
resource, but that they're not going

00:02:33.196 --> 00:02:35.066
to provide a closed answer.

00:02:35.446 --> 00:02:38.296
If people already know the
answer, and it can be looked

00:02:38.296 --> 00:02:40.726
up on Google, why ask the question?

00:02:42.076 --> 00:02:43.646
Let's ask them real questions

00:02:43.746 --> 00:02:45.546
that scientists are asking
themselves these days?

00:02:45.546 --> 00:02:49.536
And that gives them a sense
also of the reality of science.

00:02:49.536 --> 00:02:50.406
It's messy.

00:02:50.856 --> 00:02:52.076
It's unclear.

00:02:52.076 --> 00:02:53.566
There are differing points of view.

00:02:55.456 --> 00:02:59.886
What I see happening now, though,
is a consumer-driven revolution,

00:03:00.436 --> 00:03:03.286
in that the students
themselves are taking control

00:03:04.106 --> 00:03:05.676
of their informational tools.

00:03:06.026 --> 00:03:08.206
Students are bringing their
own smart phones to school.

00:03:08.206 --> 00:03:11.626
They're bringing their own tablets
to school with every expectation

00:03:11.626 --> 00:03:12.626
that they will be allowed

00:03:12.966 --> 00:03:15.816
to use these devices in
the school's network.

00:03:16.836 --> 00:03:18.726
The challenges that
I see are two-fold.

00:03:19.326 --> 00:03:23.346
One of them is students may know
how to use these tools mechanically,

00:03:24.426 --> 00:03:28.926
but it doesn't mean that they know
how to judge the value or accuracy

00:03:28.926 --> 00:03:30.796
of the information
that they're finding,

00:03:31.136 --> 00:03:33.646
and they need responsible
adults to teach them.

00:03:34.796 --> 00:03:37.966
If you start with four levels
of data, information, knowledge,

00:03:37.966 --> 00:03:41.786
and understanding, data and
information are the sorts of things

00:03:41.856 --> 00:03:43.286
that Google can provide for you.

00:03:44.366 --> 00:03:46.816
Teachers don't have to
provide that stuff anymore.

00:03:47.676 --> 00:03:49.266
Historically, they
provided a lot of it.

00:03:49.876 --> 00:03:53.656
But how nice to liberate teachers and
say, "Now, you can focus on knowledge

00:03:53.656 --> 00:03:56.566
and understanding, that's
where the real payoff comes."

00:03:57.476 --> 00:04:00.796
I've been telling kids that in 1492
Columbus sailed the Ocean Blue,"

00:04:01.436 --> 00:04:07.636
why on earth waste time
presenting that, but instead focus

00:04:07.636 --> 00:04:13.456
on what were the kinds of challenges
that Columbus had with his crew

00:04:14.346 --> 00:04:17.216
to entice them to go
beyond the site of land?

00:04:17.216 --> 00:04:20.596
Now that's a very different
kind of question.

00:04:21.696 --> 00:04:24.786
And one that teachers don't often
get to ask, because they spend

00:04:24.786 --> 00:04:27.466
so much time on the trivial
stuff that can be looked up.

00:04:28.606 --> 00:04:31.246
The value of the question for
the kids is it gets them thinking

00:04:31.246 --> 00:04:34.146
about topics in a deep way.

00:04:34.726 --> 00:04:40.286
If history teachers only get to spend
time teaching the rough outlines

00:04:40.286 --> 00:04:41.966
of history in terms of events,

00:04:42.596 --> 00:04:45.876
the meaning behind those
events is amazingly lost!

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:54.926
To me the real power of technology
in the classroom comes when we use it

00:04:54.986 --> 00:04:57.416
to do things we couldn't
do before at all.

00:04:58.226 --> 00:05:00.126
Not just to do old
things differently.

00:05:01.096 --> 00:05:04.976
So technology is important
in education to the extent

00:05:05.436 --> 00:05:09.136
that allows them to
achieve educational goals

00:05:10.566 --> 00:05:12.146
in some powerful new ways.
