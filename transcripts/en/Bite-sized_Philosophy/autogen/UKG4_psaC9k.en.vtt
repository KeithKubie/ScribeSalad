which I don't I don't like that question

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190
which I don't I don't like that question
 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.970
which I don't I don't like that question
first of all it's an attempt to - it's

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980
first of all it's an attempt to - it's
 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.610
first of all it's an attempt to - it's
an attempt to box me in in a sense and

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620
an attempt to box me in in a sense and
 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.099
an attempt to box me in in a sense and
the reason that it's an attempt to box

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109
the reason that it's an attempt to box
 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.200
the reason that it's an attempt to box
me in is because the question is asked

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210
me in is because the question is asked
 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.210
me in is because the question is asked
so that I can be firmly placed on one

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220
so that I can be firmly placed on one
 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.509
so that I can be firmly placed on one
side of a - of a binary argument and and

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:25.519
side of a - of a binary argument and and
 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.310
side of a - of a binary argument and and
the reason I don't like to answer it is

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320
the reason I don't like to answer it is
 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.169
the reason I don't like to answer it is
because a I don't like to be boxed in

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179
because a I don't like to be boxed in
 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.569
because a I don't like to be boxed in
and B because I don't know what the

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579
and B because I don't know what the
 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.910
and B because I don't know what the
person means by believe or God and they

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920
person means by believe or God and they
 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.100
person means by believe or God and they
think they know and the probability that

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110
think they know and the probability that
 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.850
think they know and the probability that
they construe belief and construe God

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860
they construe belief and construe God
 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.729
they construe belief and construe God
the same way I do is virtually zero so

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739
the same way I do is virtually zero so
 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.920
the same way I do is virtually zero so
it's a question that doesn't work for me

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930
it's a question that doesn't work for me
 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.240
it's a question that doesn't work for me
on multiple levels of analysis but but

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250
on multiple levels of analysis but but
 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.410
on multiple levels of analysis but but
strangely enough just as we were talking

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420
strangely enough just as we were talking
 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.299
strangely enough just as we were talking
I the answer to that question popped

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309
I the answer to that question popped
 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.490
I the answer to that question popped
into my head I act as if God exists now

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500
into my head I act as if God exists now
 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.049
into my head I act as if God exists now
you can decide for yourself whether that

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059
you can decide for yourself whether that
 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.840
you can decide for yourself whether that
means whether that I believe in him so

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850
means whether that I believe in him so
 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.340
means whether that I believe in him so
to speak but I act as if he exists so

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350
to speak but I act as if he exists so
 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.550
to speak but I act as if he exists so
that's a good enough answer for that

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560
that's a good enough answer for that
 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.109
that's a good enough answer for that
then with regards to these other issues

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119
then with regards to these other issues
 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.330
then with regards to these other issues
the divinity of Christ well I would say

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340
the divinity of Christ well I would say
 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.880
the divinity of Christ well I would say
the same problems with the question

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890
the same problems with the question
 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.520
the same problems with the question
formulation obtained what do you mean by

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530
formulation obtained what do you mean by
 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.800
formulation obtained what do you mean by
divine and also what do you mean by

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810
divine and also what do you mean by
 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.170
divine and also what do you mean by
Christ these are very very difficult

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180
Christ these are very very difficult
 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.990
Christ these are very very difficult
questions now I believe that for all

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000
questions now I believe that for all
 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.819
questions now I believe that for all
intents and purposes I believe that the

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829
intents and purposes I believe that the
 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.289
intents and purposes I believe that the
logos is divine insofar as we if by

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299
logos is divine insofar as we if by
 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.660
logos is divine insofar as we if by
divine you mean of ultimate value of

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670
divine you mean of ultimate value of
 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.260
divine you mean of ultimate value of
ultimate transcendent value yes it's

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270
ultimate transcendent value yes it's
 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.780
ultimate transcendent value yes it's
divine it's associated with death and

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790
divine it's associated with death and
 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.120
divine it's associated with death and
rebirth clearly because the logos

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130
rebirth clearly because the logos
 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.179
rebirth clearly because the logos
dismantles you and rebuilds you so

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189
dismantles you and rebuilds you so
 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.560
dismantles you and rebuilds you so
that's what happens when you make an

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570
that's what happens when you make an
 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.359
that's what happens when you make an
error when you make an error some part

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369
error when you make an error some part
 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.999
error when you make an error some part
of you has to go that's a sacrifice you

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009
of you has to go that's a sacrifice you
 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.560
of you has to go that's a sacrifice you
have to let it go sometimes it's a big

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570
have to let it go sometimes it's a big
 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.780
have to let it go sometimes it's a big
part of you it's it's sometimes it can

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790
part of you it's it's sometimes it can
 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.399
part of you it's it's sometimes it can
be such a big part of you that you

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409
be such a big part of you that you
 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.590
be such a big part of you that you
actually die

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600
actually die
 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.420
actually die
right instead of dying and being reborn

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430
right instead of dying and being reborn
 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.520
right instead of dying and being reborn
is there something more than merely

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530
is there something more than merely
 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.620
is there something more than merely
metaphorical about the idea of being of

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630
metaphorical about the idea of being of
 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.690
metaphorical about the idea of being of
dying and being reborn yes there is

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700
dying and being reborn yes there is
 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.070
dying and being reborn yes there is
because those are associated with

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080
because those are associated with
 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.290
because those are associated with
physiological transformations

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300
physiological transformations
 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.050
physiological transformations
how what's the ultimate extent of that

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060
how what's the ultimate extent of that
 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.270
how what's the ultimate extent of that
that's a good question

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280
that's a good question
 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.810
that's a good question
you know the question is what happens to

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820
you know the question is what happens to
 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.990
you know the question is what happens to
the world around you as you embark as

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000
the world around you as you embark as
 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.330
the world around you as you embark as
you increasingly embody the logos and

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340
you increasingly embody the logos and
 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.170
you increasingly embody the logos and
the answer to that is we don't know we

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180
the answer to that is we don't know we
 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.610
the answer to that is we don't know we
don't know what the ultimate level of

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620
don't know what the ultimate level of
 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.460
don't know what the ultimate level of
this now the hypothesis is a hypothesis

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470
this now the hypothesis is a hypothesis
 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.350
this now the hypothesis is a hypothesis
that extends to some degree to Buddha as

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360
that extends to some degree to Buddha as
 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.660
that extends to some degree to Buddha as
well the hypothesis is that there has

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670
well the hypothesis is that there has
 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.330
well the hypothesis is that there has
been one or two individuals who managed

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340
been one or two individuals who managed
 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.520
been one or two individuals who managed
that and that in their management of

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530
that and that in their management of
 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.790
that and that in their management of
that they transcended death itself well

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800
that they transcended death itself well
 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.440
that they transcended death itself well
then you might ask yourself well what do

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450
then you might ask yourself well what do
 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.290
then you might ask yourself well what do
you mean by transcended death well in

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300
you mean by transcended death well in
 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.210
you mean by transcended death well in
the case of Christ let's assume he was a

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220
the case of Christ let's assume he was a
 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.850
the case of Christ let's assume he was a
historical figure for the for the time

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860
historical figure for the for the time
 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.380
historical figure for the for the time
being which i think is the simplest

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390
being which i think is the simplest
 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.140
being which i think is the simplest
thing to assume I think there's

thing to assume I think there's
 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.630
thing to assume I think there's
sufficient evidence to conclude that you

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640
sufficient evidence to conclude that you
 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.390
sufficient evidence to conclude that you
could conclude otherwise but I

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400
could conclude otherwise but I
 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.290
could conclude otherwise but I
personally I feel that there's

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300
personally I feel that there's
 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:13.580
personally I feel that there's
sufficient evidence to conclude that did

sufficient evidence to conclude that did

he is his resurrection real but his

spirit lives on that's certainly the
 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.260
spirit lives on that's certainly the
case in what sense do you mean spirit

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270
case in what sense do you mean spirit
 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.430
case in what sense do you mean spirit
just to qualify then how well let's

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440
just to qualify then how well let's
 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.320
just to qualify then how well let's
imagine that a spirit is a pattern of

imagine that a spirit is a pattern of
 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.470
imagine that a spirit is a pattern of
being and we know that patterns can
