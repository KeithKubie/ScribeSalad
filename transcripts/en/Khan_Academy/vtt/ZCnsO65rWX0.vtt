00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:01.323
- [Voiceover] So we're told

00:00:01.323 --> 00:00:02.892
let g be a differentiable function

00:00:02.892 --> 00:00:06.253
defined over the closed interval
from negative six to six.

00:00:06.253 --> 00:00:08.435
The graph of its derivative,

00:00:08.435 --> 00:00:10.871
so they're giving the
graphing the derivative of g,

00:00:10.871 --> 00:00:12.174
g prime is given below.

00:00:12.174 --> 00:00:13.471
So this isn't the graph of g.

00:00:13.471 --> 00:00:15.539
This is the graph of g prime.

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:19.706
What is the x value of the
left-most inflection point,

00:00:20.602 --> 00:00:23.331
inflection point in the graph of g.

00:00:23.331 --> 00:00:25.452
So they want, they don't
want to know the x value

00:00:25.452 --> 00:00:27.750
of the inflection points
in the graph of g prime,

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.029
in this graph.

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.362
They want to know the inflection points,

00:00:30.362 --> 00:00:34.121
the x values of the inflection
points, in the graph of g.

00:00:34.121 --> 00:00:36.107
And we have to figure
out the left-most one.

00:00:36.107 --> 00:00:37.900
So, let me just make a little table here,

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.197
to think about what is
happening at inflection points

00:00:41.197 --> 00:00:44.398
in our second derivative,
our first derivative,

00:00:44.398 --> 00:00:46.970
and our actual function.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.747
So, this is g prime, prime.

00:00:49.747 --> 00:00:50.748
This is g prime.

00:00:50.748 --> 00:00:52.467
And this is our actual, I
guess you could call it,

00:00:52.467 --> 00:00:54.058
the original function.

00:00:54.058 --> 00:00:55.918
So an inflection point are points

00:00:55.918 --> 00:00:58.908
where our second derivative
is switching sides.

00:00:58.908 --> 00:01:01.947
It's going from positive
negative or negative to positive.

00:01:01.947 --> 00:01:03.778
So, let's consider that first scenario.

00:01:03.778 --> 00:01:07.826
So g, so going from positive to negative.

00:01:07.826 --> 00:01:10.493
Positive, positive, to negative.

00:01:14.026 --> 00:01:14.918
So if g prime prime,

00:01:14.918 --> 00:01:17.298
if the second derivative's
going from positive to negative,

00:01:17.298 --> 00:01:19.719
what is the first derivative doing?

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:21.069
Well, remember, the second derivative,

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:24.128
is the derivative of the first derivative.

00:01:24.128 --> 00:01:27.268
So, where the second
derivative is positive,

00:01:27.268 --> 00:01:28.717
where the second derivative is positive,

00:01:28.717 --> 00:01:32.226
that means that the first
derivative is increasing.

00:01:32.226 --> 00:01:35.767
So, if second derivative's
going from positive to negative,

00:01:35.767 --> 00:01:36.600
that means first derivative

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.850
is going from increasing to decreasing.

00:01:41.107 --> 00:01:43.197
From increasing to decreasing.

00:01:43.197 --> 00:01:44.957
And the function itself,

00:01:44.957 --> 00:01:47.478
well when the second
derivative is positive,

00:01:47.478 --> 00:01:50.488
we are going to be, that means,

00:01:50.488 --> 00:01:54.999
that means that the slope
is constantly increasing.

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:57.797
And so that means that
we are concave upwards.

00:01:57.797 --> 00:01:59.464
So, concave upwards.

00:02:02.377 --> 00:02:04.127
Upwards to downwards.

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.707
To concave, to concave downwards.

00:02:08.707 --> 00:02:11.478
But they've given us the graph of g prime.

00:02:11.478 --> 00:02:14.004
So let's focus on what are the points

00:02:14.004 --> 00:02:17.626
where g prime is going from
increasing to decreasing.

00:02:17.626 --> 00:02:18.459
So let's see.

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.848
G prime is increasing,
increasing, increasing,

00:02:20.848 --> 00:02:23.388
increasing, increasing at a slower rate,

00:02:23.388 --> 00:02:24.729
and then it starts decreasing.

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:25.864
So, right over there

00:02:25.864 --> 00:02:27.966
it's going from increasing to decreasing.

00:02:27.966 --> 00:02:29.924
So then it's decreasing,
decreasing, decreasing.

00:02:29.924 --> 00:02:31.846
Then it goes increasing,
increasing, increasing,

00:02:31.846 --> 00:02:34.113
increasing, and then decreasing again.

00:02:34.113 --> 00:02:35.535
So that's another point where we're going

00:02:35.535 --> 00:02:37.833
from increasing to decreasing.

00:02:37.833 --> 00:02:38.666
And those are the only ones

00:02:38.666 --> 00:02:41.174
that look like we're going
from increasing to decreasing.

00:02:41.174 --> 00:02:42.765
But we're not done yet.

00:02:42.765 --> 00:02:44.564
Because it's not just about going from

00:02:44.564 --> 00:02:46.773
the second derivative going
from positive to negative,

00:02:46.773 --> 00:02:47.853
it's also the other way around.

00:02:47.853 --> 00:02:50.952
Any time the second
derivative is switching signs.

00:02:50.952 --> 00:02:52.232
So, it's also the situation

00:02:52.232 --> 00:02:55.899
where we're going from
negative to positive.

00:02:56.992 --> 00:03:01.933
Or, for the first derivative
is going from decreasing,

00:03:01.933 --> 00:03:04.792
decreasing to increasing.

00:03:04.792 --> 00:03:06.751
Decreasing to increasing.

00:03:06.751 --> 00:03:08.223
Well let's see we're
decreasing, decreasing,

00:03:08.223 --> 00:03:10.624
decreasing, and then
we're increasing, alright.

00:03:10.624 --> 00:03:12.076
So it's right there.

00:03:12.076 --> 00:03:14.567
And then we're increasing, decreasing,

00:03:14.567 --> 00:03:17.225
decreasing, decreasing,
and then we're increasing.

00:03:17.225 --> 00:03:18.254
So right over there.

00:03:18.254 --> 00:03:19.852
So these are the inflection points

00:03:19.852 --> 00:03:22.523
that I've just figured out visually.

00:03:22.523 --> 00:03:24.404
So, if you look at the choices,

00:03:24.404 --> 00:03:26.636
if we want to answer
the original question,

00:03:26.636 --> 00:03:30.488
well the left-most one is it
x is equal to negative three?

00:03:30.488 --> 00:03:32.377
It's x equals negative three.

00:03:32.377 --> 00:03:35.677
X equals negative one is indeed a x value,

00:03:35.677 --> 00:03:37.484
where we have an inflection point.

00:03:37.484 --> 00:03:39.467
And let's see, x equals two is one,

00:03:39.467 --> 00:03:40.386
and so is x equals four.

00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:43.466
So they actually listed, all
of these are inflection points.

00:03:43.466 --> 00:03:46.716
And they just wanted the left-most one.
