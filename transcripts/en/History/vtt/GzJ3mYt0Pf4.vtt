00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.530
NARRATOR: It's 20 below zero
in Alaska's White Mountains

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.270
where Marty
Meierotto's reclaiming

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.300
his piece of the remote
wilderness, a 150

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.070
mile long trap line
he's worked more

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.800
than three decades to build.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.970
MARTY MEIEROTTO:
We're about as far

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.870
away from home as I can get.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.700
There we go.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.330
We got to keep pressing on.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.270
NARRATOR: His plan to increase
his profits by running

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.330
the entire length of the
line for the first time

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.100
ever is keeping him on the move.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.000
MARTY MEIEROTTO: Breaking
trail, punching new line,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.100
building sets.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.900
It's hard work.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.000
But it's part of the job.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.530
That's what I have to do.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.470
NARRATOR: But after four
weeks of nonstop clearing

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.930
and setting, he's still
only halfway done.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.170
And every second day, he doubles
back to check on his traps.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.900
MARTY MEIEROTTO: Bingo!

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.730
That's nice when you make
a set and come and get it.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.770
Man, he's a dark one.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.930
Big, dark male.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.800
Man, that's cool!

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.070
NARRATOR: So far this season,
he's hauled in 25 marten,

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.930
despite the recent sighting
of wolverine activity.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.030
MARTY MEIEROTTO: Son of a--

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.300
Wolverine really
trashed the place.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.430
He was in the trap, but
he wasn't in there long.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.730
NARRATOR: Marty set a
heavy trap two weeks ago.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.930
But this predator is
notoriously difficult to catch.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.730
He demolished everything
and the trap is empty.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.730
They are extremely hard to hold.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.770
Such a bummer.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.370
All he left me was
a couple of hairs.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.130
NARRATOR: Wolverines
are scavengers,

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.600
and they're persistent.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.870
With more than
100 miles to work,

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:13.330
Marty's spread thin, leaving
his line vulnerable to plunder.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.200
MARTY MEIEROTTO:
Wolverine are my nemesis.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.430
They're bad hombres.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.000
They're notorious
for just robbing you.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.470
Now we've got a game to play.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.430
Sometimes I win.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.700
Sometimes he wins.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.900
We'll see what he did over here.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.330
Hey marten!

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.030
We got lucky.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.500
That's a big male.
I was worried.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.430
I thought, oh, he's going
to be picking all my sets.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.300
You know, eating
the fur I catch.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.270
But he didn't touch this
one, so that's a good sign.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.170
He's a gentleman wolverine
as far as wolverines go.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.000
Even though he's a sweetheart
of a guy, we need to catch him.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.100
I got lucky.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.900
Yeah, good deal.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.630
NARRATOR: With night falling
over Alaska's White Mountains,

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.670
Marty wraps his day on a high.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.670
Time to see what I got here.

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.230
This might be one of
my best picks ever.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.200
Let's see.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.400
One, two, three.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.870
This is a red letter day.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.600
I don't-- this is rare
that I do this good

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.030
and have this good of a day.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:08.330
Seven, eight, nine.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:13.800
16 marten!

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:17.900
Wow!

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.000
What a day!

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.270
What a day!

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.970
Makes me want to just
keep trapping, keep going.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.030
NARRATOR: The mega haul
is a record breaker,

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.030
the most Marty's ever caught
in a single day on the line.

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.230
MARTY MEIEROTTO: Man, I can't
believe it, but it's like,

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.100
pouring rain out here.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.670
Everything's going
to get coated in ice.

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.370
Hopefully it'll stop soon.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.230
I'm going to want to get
these out of the rain.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.600
Well it's time for dinner.
