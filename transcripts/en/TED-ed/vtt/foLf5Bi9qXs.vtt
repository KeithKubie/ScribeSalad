00:00:07.245 --> 00:00:11.543
Over 100,000 metric tons
of caffeine are consumed

00:00:11.543 --> 00:00:13.812
around the world every year.

00:00:13.812 --> 00:00:18.034
That's equivalent to the weight
of 14 Eiffel Towers.

00:00:18.034 --> 00:00:21.344
Most of this caffeine is consumed
in coffee and tea,

00:00:21.344 --> 00:00:23.793
but it's also ingested in some sodas,

00:00:23.793 --> 00:00:24.667
chocolate,

00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:26.244
caffeine pills,

00:00:26.244 --> 00:00:29.264
and even beverages labeled decaf.

00:00:29.264 --> 00:00:32.991
Caffeine helps us feel alert,
focused, happy, and energetic,

00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:35.982
even if we haven't had enough sleep.

00:00:35.982 --> 00:00:40.410
But it can also raise our blood pressure,
and make us feel anxious.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.153
It's the world most widely used drug.

00:00:43.153 --> 00:00:46.612
So how does it keep us awake?

00:00:46.612 --> 00:00:50.892
Caffeine evolved in plants where
it serves a few purposes.

00:00:50.892 --> 00:00:55.474
In high doses, as it's found in the leaves
and seeds of certain species,

00:00:55.474 --> 00:00:57.784
it's toxic to insects.

00:00:57.784 --> 00:01:01.672
But when they consume it in lower doses,
as it's found in nectar,

00:01:01.672 --> 00:01:05.924
it can actually help them remember
and revisit flowers.

00:01:05.924 --> 00:01:11.403
In the human body, caffeine acts as a
stimulant for the central nervous system.

00:01:11.403 --> 00:01:15.747
It keeps us awake by blocking one of
the body's key sleep-inducing molecules,

00:01:15.747 --> 00:01:19.402
a substance called adenosine.

00:01:19.402 --> 00:01:22.013
Your body needs a constant supply
of energy,

00:01:22.013 --> 00:01:27.314
which it gets by breaking down
a high-energy molecule called ATP.

00:01:27.314 --> 00:01:28.254
In the process,

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:32.794
it liberates adenosine,
ATP's chemical backbone.

00:01:32.794 --> 00:01:37.645
Neurons in your brain have receptors
perfectly tailored to this molecule.

00:01:37.645 --> 00:01:39.954
When adenosine docks to these receptors,

00:01:39.954 --> 00:01:43.665
it activates a cascade 
of biochemical reactions

00:01:43.665 --> 00:01:45.926
that cause neurons to fire more sluggishly

00:01:45.926 --> 00:01:50.465
and slow the release of important
brain-signaling molecules.

00:01:50.465 --> 00:01:53.265
In other words, you get sleepy.

00:01:53.265 --> 00:01:58.285
Caffeine is what's called an adenosine
receptor antagonist.

00:01:58.285 --> 00:02:01.856
That means it derails this process
of slowing your neurons down

00:02:01.856 --> 00:02:04.385
by blocking adenosine receptors.

00:02:04.385 --> 00:02:08.627
Caffeine and adenosine have a similar
molecular structure,

00:02:08.627 --> 00:02:12.456
close enough that caffeine can wedge into
the adenosine receptors,

00:02:12.456 --> 00:02:15.266
but not close enough to activate them.

00:02:15.266 --> 00:02:18.855
To summarize, 
adenosine inhibits your neurons.

00:02:18.855 --> 00:02:24.727
Caffeine inhibits the inhibitor,
so it stimulates you.

00:02:24.727 --> 00:02:27.306
Caffeine can also boost positive feelings.

00:02:27.306 --> 00:02:29.855
In some neurons, the adenosine receptors

00:02:29.855 --> 00:02:34.367
are linked to receptors 
for another molecule called dopamine.

00:02:34.367 --> 00:02:38.570
One of dopamine's roles in the brain
is to promote feelings of pleasure.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.871
When adenosine docks in one of these
paired receptors,

00:02:41.871 --> 00:02:45.948
that can make it harder for dopamine
to fit in its own spot,

00:02:45.948 --> 00:02:48.758
interrupting its mood-lifting work.

00:02:48.758 --> 00:02:53.338
But when caffeine takes adenosine's place,
it doesn't have the same effect,

00:02:53.338 --> 00:02:55.948
and dopamine can slide in.

00:02:55.948 --> 00:03:00.930
There's evidence that caffeine's effects
on adenosine and dopamine receptors

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.180
can have long-term benefits, too,
reducing the risk of diseases

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.129
like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's,
and some types of cancer.

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.998
Caffeine can also ramp up the body's
ability to burn fat.

00:03:14.998 --> 00:03:17.510
In fact, some sports organizations think

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.960
that caffeine gives athletes 
an unfair advantage

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.308
and have placed limits on its consumption.

00:03:24.308 --> 00:03:27.120
From 1972 until 2004,

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.739
Olympic athletes had to stay below
a certain blood-caffeine concentration

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.120
to compete.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.729
Of course, not all of caffeine's effects
are so helpful.

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:40.089
It might make you feel better
and more alert,

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:43.220
but it can also raise your heart rate
and blood pressure,

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.410
cause increased urination or diarrhea,

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.953
and contribute to insomnia and anxiety.

00:03:49.953 --> 00:03:52.801
Plus, the foods and beverages
caffeine is found in

00:03:52.801 --> 00:03:58.541
have their own impacts on your body
that have to be taken into account.

00:03:58.541 --> 00:04:01.571
Your brain can adapt to regular
consumption of caffeine.

00:04:01.571 --> 00:04:04.832
If your adenosine receptors 
are perpetually clogged,

00:04:04.832 --> 00:04:07.720
your body will manufacture extra ones.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.939
That way, even with caffeine around,

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:15.252
adenosine can still do its job
of signaling the brain to power down.

00:04:15.252 --> 00:04:18.723
That's why you may find you need
to consume more and more caffeine

00:04:18.723 --> 00:04:20.853
to feel as alert.

00:04:20.853 --> 00:04:24.473
There are more and more adenosine
receptors to block.

00:04:24.473 --> 00:04:26.973
It's also why if you suddenly 
quit caffeine,

00:04:26.973 --> 00:04:30.194
you may experience 
an unpleasant withdrawal.

00:04:30.194 --> 00:04:32.493
With plenty of receptors 
and no competition,

00:04:32.493 --> 00:04:34.853
adenosine can work overtime,

00:04:34.853 --> 00:04:36.473
causing symptoms like headaches,

00:04:36.473 --> 00:04:37.634
tiredness,

00:04:37.634 --> 00:04:40.212
and depressed moods.

00:04:40.212 --> 00:04:44.963
But in a few days, the extra adenosine
receptors will disappear,

00:04:44.963 --> 00:04:46.993
your body will readjust,

00:04:46.993 --> 00:04:49.593
and you'll feel just as alert as ever,

00:04:49.593 --> 00:04:53.233
even without an infusion of the world's
most popular stimulant.
