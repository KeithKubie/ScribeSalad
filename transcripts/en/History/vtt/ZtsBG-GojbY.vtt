00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:02.120
In your first round
of competition today,

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:02.880
you'll be using these.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.120
These are .50 caliber flintlock
single-shot black powder

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.540
Trapper pistols will
use to forge signature

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.330
blades in your signature style.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.170
COREY: [sighs]
Flintlock pistols?

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.830
What are we going to
do with these things?

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.330
It doesn't look like
there's any steel in them.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.540
WIL WILLIS: You
will have 10 minutes

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.040
to work on your designs.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.580
You will have three hours
to forge your blades.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.920
Good luck, bladesmiths.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.420
Your 10-minute design
window starts now.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.920
COREY: Uh, I'm designing
a modified chef knife,

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.540
just because it's a fairly
easy shape for me to knock out.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.250
WIL WILLIS: Your design
window is now closed.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.920
Your three-hour forge
time starts now.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.500
Oh, the poor, poor gun!
Bye!

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.830
I cut my hand on a barnacle
the day before I came here.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.120
And this gauze makes
holding a hammer

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.120
in my right hand extremely
difficult, unfortunately.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.290
So I feed it over
the power hammer

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.960
to do the initial forge weld.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.290
That power hammer no joke!

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.540
MAN 1: He's got one
forge weld folded over.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.960
He squished it flat.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.920
And I don't think that
forge world is holding.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.420
He's obviously fighting it.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.120
COREY: The power hammer is
just way too aggressive.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.540
I realize it's drawn
out way too much.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.960
And I have a bunch
of delaminations.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.790
[bleep] I have to just
continuously start

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.540
folding this fillet and
trying to consolidate

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.540
the steel into a solid block.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.290
Otherwise, I'm screwed.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.790
This could be [bleep].

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.620
Right now, the forge
welds are coming apart.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.580
That's a major problem.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.080
It's just sucky.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.080
MAN 1: Corey will try to
press everything together.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.330
And it looked to me
like he pressed parts

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.000
and it opened up other parts.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.920
[groans] My arm's getting
tired and time's running out.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.670
But as long as I can
get the welds to stick,

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.120
I know I can get a blade
shaped out quickly.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.920
You just have 60 tiny little
minutes to finish your work!

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.790
His 4140 is not going
to get as hard as he

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.170
thinks he might be able to get.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.460
MAN 1: But here's the thing.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.960
It might not be as
hard as the file.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.250
It's hard enough
to hold an edge.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.170
I've decided this is as
hard as I can get this blade.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.540
And I'm just going to
move on to the grinder

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.380
and start cleaning it up.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:40.380
10, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.710
Bladesmiths, shut down your
machines, drop your tools.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.040
This round is over.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.540
[whistling]

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.960
The overall shape of my
knife is acceptable to me.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.670
The hardness, that's whatever.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.500
Let the judges
take a look at it.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.500
Now it's time for the
judges to take a closer

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.380
look at all of your work.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.710
Tony, you're up first.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.580
Your work out there
was textbook work,

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.880
from the use and
control of big blue

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.000
all the way to normalizing
and preparing your blade.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.380
Masterful.
WIL WILLIS: All right, Corey.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.710
You're up.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:17.500
Please present your
blade to the judges.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.000
MAN 2: Well, Corey, I like
the design of your knife.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.250
It is a little bit snug here.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.000
But sometimes, a
snug fit on the blade

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.540
makes it one with my whole hand.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.250
It's just, how are you
going to transition

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.920
that if you move to the second
round to make it comfortable?

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.420
That's important.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.380
You had me sweating
there in the beginning.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.250
The first couple forge
welds didn't seem

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.670
to stick very well for you.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.040
But you didn't give up.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.420
And eventually, you
got the welds to stick.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.420
I can see some evidence of the
welds maybe not being 100%.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.750
But overall, well done.
- Thank you.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.080
WIL WILLIS: Gage, you're up.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.380
MAN 1: Good choice
on design for both

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.420
the apple slice and the chop.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.040
There's a decided
warp, especially

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.960
on the backside of the blade.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.790
You added that low carbon
steel to the back here.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.540
That's a really good idea.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.120
I'm just a little bit worried,
because I can see, right here

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.380
and right here, where
that weld starts

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.540
and starts to come together.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.460
Bladesmiths, the judges have
completed their deliberation,

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.620
and they've made
their final decision.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.210
It's time for one of
you to leave the forge.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.620
Gage, your blade did
not make the cut.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.620
Gage, your personal
integrity is not in question.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.460
The structural integrity
of your blade is.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.620
The junction where your
tang meets the blade

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.330
has crack and delam on it.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.330
For that reason,
we're letting you go.
