What is it about
side chick, side dude humor

00:00:15.414 --> 00:00:17.283 align:start size:63% position:38%
that is so enticing?

00:00:17.316 --> 00:00:19.952
- Nothing is funnier
than a bad idea, man.

00:00:19.985 --> 00:00:21.621
All right?
Like, these--these stories

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:23.756
do not ever end positively.

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.425
They tend to always end in ruin.

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:27.093 size:78% position:39%
- Black folks love drama.

00:00:27.126 --> 00:00:28.728 align:start position:0%
And we love comedy.

00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:30.596 align:start position:0%
And so any time
that there's errors,

00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:32.165 size:75% position:38%
there's gonna be comedy.

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:34.067 align:end position:100%
- I'm pretty sure I've
been a--a side dude.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.902
- You didn't know though?
- It wasn't confirmed.

00:00:35.935 --> 00:00:36.936 align:end position:100%
But you get a feeling
in your heart.

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:38.271 align:start position:0%
- In your gut.

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:39.505
- I ain't
never had no side chick.

00:00:39.538 --> 00:00:41.040
I ain't ever been a side dude...

00:00:41.073 --> 00:00:42.308
- All right.
- To my--to my knowledge.

00:00:42.341 --> 00:00:44.110 align:start position:0%
- I dated rappers,
so the odds

00:00:44.143 --> 00:00:46.312 align:start position:0%
of me being a side chick
at some point are very high.

00:00:46.345 --> 00:00:50.083 align:end position:100%
- Why are jokes about
side chicks and side dudes

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:52.051 align:end position:100%
more popular in
the black community

00:00:52.084 --> 00:00:53.486 align:start size:81% position:19%
than in other communities?

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:56.289 align:start position:0%
- Our ability to
always take everything

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:57.924 align:start position:0%
and turn it into positive
is something that

00:00:57.957 --> 00:00:59.625 align:start position:0%
black folks have been
forced to do,

00:00:59.658 --> 00:01:01.661 align:start position:0%
and so it's just one of
the next things that we do.

00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:03.963
- What's she's saying is that
Black Twitter is gumbo, right?

00:01:03.996 --> 00:01:05.431 align:start position:0%
- Mmm, yes.

00:01:05.464 --> 00:01:06.933 align:end position:100%
- And the scraps
are the things that

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.601 align:end position:100%
maybe the mainstream
doesn't deal with,

00:01:08.634 --> 00:01:10.103
like side chick humor.
- Yes.

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:11.871 align:end position:100%
- But we done thrown that
in the roux.

00:01:11.904 --> 00:01:13.339 align:end position:100%
And we over here
feasting on some.

00:01:13.372 --> 00:01:14.874
- We cooking.
- And we cooking.

00:01:14.907 --> 00:01:16.642 align:start position:0%
- I think it's more taboo
to white people.

00:01:16.675 --> 00:01:18.478 align:start position:0%
'Cause we know
white people get down.

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:20.847 align:start position:0%
A white--like a white dude
have a side chick,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.516
and plan to kill his whole
family so he can be with her.

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.984 align:end position:100%
- On Black Twitter, it's really
about the side chick.

00:01:25.017 --> 00:01:26.752 align:start position:0%
- Yes.

00:01:26.785 --> 00:01:28.821 align:end position:100%
- Now, is that a misogynist
kind of situation?

00:01:28.854 --> 00:01:30.189 align:start position:0%
- Yes.
I think it's misogynistic

00:01:30.222 --> 00:01:32.425 align:start position:0%
because it never
ends up being about

00:01:32.458 --> 00:01:34.327 align:start position:0%
the fact that you shouldn't
have a side chick

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.828 align:start position:0%
in the first place.

00:01:35.861 --> 00:01:37.463
- The side chick is practice.

00:01:37.496 --> 00:01:39.432
How am I gonna know
how to treat you and

00:01:39.465 --> 00:01:41.467
what nice places to take you...
- [laughs]

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.136
- If I--I can't
be in a relationship

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:44.670
just freestyling, Amanda.

00:01:44.703 --> 00:01:46.772 size:88% position:44%
My girl Amanda like seafood.

00:01:46.805 --> 00:01:48.708
Me and my side chick
need to come here

00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:51.210
on a Thursday afternoon and
see what Stevie's talking about.

00:01:51.243 --> 00:01:53.479
I'm not about to bring
my baby to Stevie's

00:01:53.512 --> 00:01:55.681
and the gumbo
not the way she like it.

00:01:55.714 --> 00:01:57.450 size:88% position:44%
- You listening to a [BLEEP]
with sunglasses on inside.

00:01:57.483 --> 00:01:59.118 align:start size:50% position:50%
- Okay--[laughs]

00:01:59.151 --> 00:02:00.853
<i> But that [BLEEP]
 with the sunglasses</i>

00:02:00.886 --> 00:02:02.455
<i> is something like
 a Black Twitter pioneer.</i>

00:02:02.488 --> 00:02:04.891
- So I made this meme that says

00:02:04.924 --> 00:02:07.593 align:start position:0%
"I might not be
the man crush Monday,

00:02:07.626 --> 00:02:10.329 line:0%
<i> but I smashed on
 side [BLEEP] Sunday."</i>

00:02:10.362 --> 00:02:12.899
<i>- You may talk about side chicks
 Monday through Saturday,</i>

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:14.834
<i> but thanks to Karlous,</i>

00:02:14.867 --> 00:02:16.736
<i> Sunday is the day
 to appreciate the side dude.</i>

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.704 align:end position:100%
Are these memes--
is this humor

00:02:18.737 --> 00:02:22.175 align:end position:100%
normalizing adultery
within our generation?

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:23.609
- Of course, it normalizes it.

00:02:23.642 --> 00:02:25.378
- It ain't normalizing it.

00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:28.181
It's what it's been
forever and ever and...

00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:29.482 align:start position:0%
- But it used to
have shame attached to it.

00:02:29.515 --> 00:02:31.350
And now it don't.
- Ahh, mm.

00:02:31.383 --> 00:02:33.352
- Yeah, but Bill--Bill Clinton
almost got impeached,

00:02:33.385 --> 00:02:35.855
but we knew how Bill Clinton got
down a long time before that.

00:02:35.888 --> 00:02:37.623
And we made him the president.

00:02:37.656 --> 00:02:40.092 align:start position:0%
- For women, it's never
been a look to be a side chick.

00:02:40.125 --> 00:02:41.928 line:0%
- Yeah--
- Now, hoes be winning.

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:43.930 line:0%
<i> - You know who's also winning?
 Kermit the Frog.</i>

00:02:43.963 --> 00:02:46.399 line:0%
<i> He's pretty much the mayor
 of Side Chick Town.</i>

00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:48.968 line:0%
<i> "That moment you see
 an old side chick</i>

00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:51.237
<i> and she's walking with a kid."</i>

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.538 align:start size:75% position:25%
Let's talk about Kermit.

00:02:52.571 --> 00:02:54.073 align:start size:72% position:28%
Kermit is from Muppets.

00:02:54.106 --> 00:02:55.374 align:end position:100%
He's not supposed
to be representing

00:02:55.407 --> 00:02:57.710 size:88% position:56%
smashing thangs on the side.

00:02:57.743 --> 00:02:59.378
- Kermit the Frog
got side chicks.

00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:01.047
He drinking Hennessy.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.748
Somebody photoshopped
a cigarette on him.

00:03:02.781 --> 00:03:05.184
Like, the places
that I've seen Kermit the Frog,

00:03:05.217 --> 00:03:07.186
I was like, "Shit, Kermit,
me too, I relate."

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:08.654 align:end position:100%
- I think it's
also funny 'cause

00:03:08.687 --> 00:03:09.989 align:end position:100%
it just represents
a loss of innocence.

00:03:10.022 --> 00:03:11.757 align:start position:0%
- Yeah.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.793 align:end position:100%
- It's like when your parents
get divorced or

00:03:13.826 --> 00:03:15.394
when you find out your grandpa
cheated on your grandma once.

00:03:15.427 --> 00:03:17.096 align:end position:100%
And Kermit is here
to be like, "Hey,

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:18.731 align:start size:72% position:28%
"your innocence is over

00:03:18.764 --> 00:03:20.132
and real stuff is happening."
- [laughs]

00:03:20.165 --> 00:03:21.934 align:start size:47% position:53%
- Sip that tea.

00:03:21.967 --> 00:03:23.769 align:start size:81% position:19%
I want you guys to give me

00:03:23.802 --> 00:03:26.939 size:84% position:58%
some commitment humor memes

00:03:26.972 --> 00:03:28.574
<i> for this picture right here.</i>

00:03:28.607 --> 00:03:30.977
<i> - When you find
 the perfect neighborhood</i>

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.645
to raise your family in.

00:03:32.678 --> 00:03:34.113
<i> [buzzer sounds]</i>

00:03:34.146 --> 00:03:35.648
With your wife.
<i> [buzzer sounds]</i>

00:03:35.681 --> 00:03:37.350
Because you're faithful.
<i> [buzzer sounds]</i>

00:03:37.383 --> 00:03:38.818
And you don't cheat on her.
<i> [buzzer sounds]</i>

00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:40.686
- When you and your wife

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:42.221
bought your first home

00:03:42.254 --> 00:03:43.823
together.
<i> [buzzer sounds]</i>

00:03:43.856 --> 00:03:45.124
<i> - Damn, that ain't funny.</i>

00:03:45.157 --> 00:03:47.627 align:start size:50% position:50%
The next meme is

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.595 align:start size:72% position:28%
Barack kissing Michelle

00:03:49.628 --> 00:03:51.364
<i> in front of an Easter bunny.</i>

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:52.965 align:start position:0%
- I got one.

00:03:52.998 --> 00:03:55.301
"When he went to 'Carrots.'"

00:03:55.334 --> 00:03:56.769
[laughs]
<i> [buzzer sounds]</i>

00:03:56.802 --> 00:03:58.337
- What?
- You stupid, man.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:59.905
- You--you failed.
- I--I can't.

00:03:59.938 --> 00:04:01.774
- Only thing that I can think of
is like,

00:04:01.807 --> 00:04:03.943
"When it's a threesome
and you waiting on your turn."

00:04:03.976 --> 00:04:05.611
That's--that's the only--
[laughter]

00:04:05.644 --> 00:04:06.612
That's all I see right there.

00:04:06.645 --> 00:04:08.081
- That was funny.
