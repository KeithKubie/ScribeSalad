00:00:02.035 --> 00:00:03.203
Amy?

00:00:03.303 --> 00:00:06.106
Hi, I'm Cheryl Oberwood,
nutritionist to the stars.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.574
Thank you so much for
meeting with me.

00:00:07.708 --> 00:00:09.943
Phylicia Rashad has said
the nicest stuff about you.

00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:11.311
She looks incredible,
right?

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:12.412
She's 90.

00:00:12.513 --> 00:00:13.547
Wow.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.015
Okay, I'm just
gonna dive right in.

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:17.417
I can tell by looking you're
not the least you can be.

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:18.785
Yeah, no, I'm not.

00:00:18.886 --> 00:00:19.920
Well, we're
gonna change that.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.221
So what are your fitness
goals?

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:23.790
Well, my goal weight.
I don't work in weight.

00:00:23.924 --> 00:00:24.958
I work
in celebrities.

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:27.160
Which celebrity would you
like to be the same as?

00:00:27.261 --> 00:00:28.328
I would
say Christian Bale.

00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:29.663
"Machinist", "Metroland"?

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:31.398
"Newsies"?
I think "The Fighter."

00:00:31.532 --> 00:00:33.233
Okay, now, walk me through
what you eat

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.335
in a typical day.
All right.

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:37.404
In the morning, usually
I'll have, like,

00:00:37.538 --> 00:00:39.873
some yogurt
with some granola

00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:42.276
and then at lunch,
some salad.

00:00:42.376 --> 00:00:43.744
Okay-- Let me
ask you a question.

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:44.778
Yeah.

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:47.948
Have you always
been a (bleep) trash heap?

00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:49.683
Excuse me?
I'm gonna find you
the perfect diet

00:00:49.816 --> 00:00:50.851
You're gonna
stick to that diet

00:00:50.951 --> 00:00:53.153
and you're gonna become
the perfect woman.

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:56.323
Okay, option one:
The Instagram Diet.

00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:57.824
That's where you order
whatever you want,

00:00:57.925 --> 00:00:59.593
take a picture
of it, post it,

00:00:59.693 --> 00:01:00.594
throw it in the garbage.

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:01.862
Tweet it, don't
eat it.

00:01:01.962 --> 00:01:03.530
I don't
want to do that one.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.065
Option two,
the Beyoncé Diet.

00:01:05.132 --> 00:01:06.366
You find out what
Beyoncé eats

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.935
and you tell
me all about it.

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:09.136
I don't know her.

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:13.674
Option three:
The Chilean Miners Diet.

00:01:13.774 --> 00:01:16.076
Wow-- They're so
svelte.

00:01:16.143 --> 00:01:18.245
Have you thought
about doing a cleanse?

00:01:18.345 --> 00:01:19.346
What kind?

00:01:19.513 --> 00:01:22.649
The kind where you
eat anything and everything

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:24.084
as long as you don't
swallow?

00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:25.586
That's just anorexia.

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:27.487
Do you want a third season
of your show?

00:01:27.588 --> 00:01:28.856
I do.
Okay.

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:31.625
The Tapeworm Experience.

00:01:31.725 --> 00:01:33.327
Colonic Blastoff.
Um...

00:01:33.427 --> 00:01:35.095
Cambodian Holiday.

00:01:35.128 --> 00:01:37.097
Get Motivated.
Oh, what.
What's that one?

00:01:37.231 --> 00:01:39.766
That's where you are arrested
without due process.

00:01:39.867 --> 00:01:40.868
I don't think so.

00:01:40.968 --> 00:01:42.636
Everest Drop,
The Great Depression.

00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:44.104
Kentucky Meth Cycle.

00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:46.006
Harriet Tubman
and the Underground Railroad.

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:47.174
No?

00:01:47.274 --> 00:01:50.110
Tammy from "The Real World,"
Season Two, Wired Jaw.

00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:51.712
Who are
your clients again?

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:54.114
Well, have you ever seen
the movie, um,

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:55.649
every
(bleep) movie?

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:57.451
I work with everyone.
(knocking)

00:01:57.551 --> 00:01:59.353
Come in.

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:00.687
Hey, guys.

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:02.456
Hi, Angel face!

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:05.659
Amy, this is McClarty--
She's the new Bond girl.

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:07.394
Wow--
What diet did she do?

00:02:07.494 --> 00:02:09.296
I just smoke.
