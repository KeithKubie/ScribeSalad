00:00:00.231 --> 00:00:01.884
- [Instructor] The triangle shown below

00:00:01.884 --> 00:00:04.467
has an area of 75 square units.

00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:07.905
Find the missing side.

00:00:07.905 --> 00:00:10.611
So pause the video and see
if you can find the length

00:00:10.611 --> 00:00:12.361
of this missing side.

00:00:14.098 --> 00:00:15.845
Alright, now let's work
through this together.

00:00:15.845 --> 00:00:20.238
They give us the area,
they give us this side

00:00:20.238 --> 00:00:22.005
right over here, this 11.

00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:25.207
They give us this length 10, which,

00:00:25.207 --> 00:00:28.743
if we rotate this triangle you
can view it as an altitude.

00:00:28.743 --> 00:00:30.299
And in fact let me do that.

00:00:30.299 --> 00:00:32.122
Let me rotate this triangle,
because then I think

00:00:32.122 --> 00:00:35.550
it might jump out at you
how we can tackle this.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.218
So let me copy and let me paste it.

00:00:39.218 --> 00:00:42.364
So if I move it here,
but I'm gonna rotate it.

00:00:42.364 --> 00:00:46.031
So if I rotate, that
is our rotated triangle

00:00:48.464 --> 00:00:50.106
and now it might be a little bit clearer

00:00:50.106 --> 00:00:52.520
what we're talking about, this length x

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.279
that we want to figure
out, this is our base.

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:57.606
And they give us our height
and they give us our area.

00:00:57.606 --> 00:01:01.104
And we know how base, height
and area relate for a triangle.

00:01:01.104 --> 00:01:05.271
We know that area is equal
to 1/2 times the base

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:10.232
times the height, and they tell us

00:01:11.332 --> 00:01:13.892
that our area is 75 units squared.

00:01:13.892 --> 00:01:17.309
So this is 75 is equal to 1/2.

00:01:19.378 --> 00:01:20.654
What is our base?

00:01:20.654 --> 00:01:22.904
Our base is the variable x.

00:01:23.912 --> 00:01:24.745
So let's just write that down.

00:01:24.745 --> 00:01:28.340
1/2 times x and then what is our height?

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.337
Well, our height is actually the 10.

00:01:30.337 --> 00:01:31.931
If x is the length of our base,

00:01:31.931 --> 00:01:34.727
then the height of our triangle

00:01:34.727 --> 00:01:37.475
is gonna be 10, we actually
don't even need to use this 11.

00:01:37.475 --> 00:01:39.775
They're putting that there
just to distract you.

00:01:39.775 --> 00:01:43.525
So, this is going to be
our height, times 10.

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.077
So 75 is equal to 1/2 times x times 10,

00:01:48.077 --> 00:01:49.766
or, let me just rewrite it this way.

00:01:49.766 --> 00:01:53.933
We can say 75 is equal to
1/2 times 10 is equal to five

00:01:56.786 --> 00:01:59.119
times x is equal to five,

00:02:00.125 --> 00:02:02.929
let me do the x in that same color,

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:05.012
is equal to five times x.

00:02:06.023 --> 00:02:08.430
So what is x going to be?

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.859
There's a couple of ways
you could think about it.

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:13.377
You could say five times
what is equal to 75?

00:02:13.377 --> 00:02:15.083
And you might be able to figure that out.

00:02:15.083 --> 00:02:17.742
You might say, OK, five times 10 is 50,

00:02:17.742 --> 00:02:19.656
and then let's see, I need another 25,

00:02:19.656 --> 00:02:22.757
so put another five there,
so it's really five times 15,

00:02:22.757 --> 00:02:25.609
or you could do it a little
bit more systematically.

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:29.618
You can divide both sides by
what you're multiplying by x.

00:02:29.618 --> 00:02:31.679
So if you divide this side by five,

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:33.864
five times x divided by five, well,

00:02:33.864 --> 00:02:35.373
you're just going to have an x left over.

00:02:35.373 --> 00:02:37.885
But these two things were equal,

00:02:37.885 --> 00:02:39.178
so you can't just do it to one side,

00:02:39.178 --> 00:02:40.637
you have to do it to both sides.

00:02:40.637 --> 00:02:42.846
So you have to divide both sides by five.

00:02:42.846 --> 00:02:45.471
And what's 75 divided by five?

00:02:45.471 --> 00:02:47.397
Well that is 15.

00:02:47.397 --> 00:02:49.980
So you get x is equal to 15.

00:02:53.891 --> 00:02:55.176
And you can verify that.

00:02:55.176 --> 00:02:59.799
If x is equal to 15, base
times height times 1/2.

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.305
Well, it's 15 times 10 times 1/2,

00:03:02.305 --> 00:03:06.472
or 15 times five which is
going to be 75 square units.
