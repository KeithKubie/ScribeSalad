00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.067
Smarr: I'm Joseph Smarr.
I'm from Plaxo.

00:00:02.067 --> 00:00:03.901
I'm really happy to be here.

00:00:03.901 --> 00:00:05.501
This is my second Google I/O,

00:00:05.501 --> 00:00:08.334
and no better way
to sort of benchmark

00:00:08.334 --> 00:00:10.033
how much progress we've made
in the last year,

00:00:10.033 --> 00:00:12.501
which is mainly what I want
to share with you guys.

00:00:12.501 --> 00:00:14.501
Please feel free
to ask questions

00:00:14.501 --> 00:00:15.801
throughout the session
if you have.

00:00:15.801 --> 00:00:17.067
There's microphones.

00:00:17.067 --> 00:00:18.267
But I think
if I time this right

00:00:18.267 --> 00:00:19.901
there should be plenty
of time at the end

00:00:19.901 --> 00:00:22.234
for Q and A too, so I really
hope if you have questions,

00:00:22.234 --> 00:00:24.133
you'll get a chance to ask them.

00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:26.367
And gonna try to do a lot
of demos here.

00:00:26.367 --> 00:00:28.701
I know the WiFi Internet's
been a little bit flaky,

00:00:28.701 --> 00:00:30.634
so demos in a live setting
are always

00:00:30.634 --> 00:00:31.934
a little bit masochistic
to start with.

00:00:31.934 --> 00:00:33.601
But hopefully that will all work

00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:34.868
because I want you to see
how much of this stuff

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:36.868
is really real
and not just theoretical.

00:00:36.868 --> 00:00:40.601
And this little link
down here, if you can see is--

00:00:40.601 --> 00:00:42.501
there's a Google Moderator
apparently

00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:44.400
that you can submit questions
live as well

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.133
during this presentation.

00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:49.767
So ISGDHJQS.

00:00:49.767 --> 00:00:51.367
That's as merciful
as I could make it

00:00:51.367 --> 00:00:54.367
for transmission over the air.

00:00:54.367 --> 00:00:56.601
So I thought I'd start
by just briefly talking

00:00:56.601 --> 00:00:59.267
about what I said last year
to kind of contrast it

00:00:59.267 --> 00:01:00.734
from where we are today.

00:01:00.734 --> 00:01:02.801
So I gave a talk last year
at Google I/O

00:01:02.801 --> 00:01:06.901
called "OpenSocial, OpenID,
and OAuth: Oh, My!"

00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:08.100
And it was sort of starting
to say,

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.501
hey, there's this groundswell

00:01:10.501 --> 00:01:12.701
of interesting open technologies
that are starting

00:01:12.701 --> 00:01:15.067
to be developed that potentially
could let you do

00:01:15.067 --> 00:01:16.934
a lot of very interesting things
with connecting up

00:01:16.934 --> 00:01:18.634
different websites together
and not having

00:01:18.634 --> 00:01:20.834
to start over from scratch
on every site that you go to.

00:01:20.834 --> 00:01:23.968
And the real question,
I think, back then was:

00:01:23.968 --> 00:01:25.801
Where is this all going?

00:01:25.801 --> 00:01:28.133
Which of these technologies
are complementary

00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:30.601
or competitive and who's gonna
actually use them?

00:01:30.601 --> 00:01:33.501
And what are users gonna have
to learn?

00:01:33.501 --> 00:01:35.300
What are technologists
gonna have to learn?

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.267
And the picture
I sort of floated

00:01:37.267 --> 00:01:39.067
was that I said
I think what's gonna happen

00:01:39.067 --> 00:01:42.067
is there's gonna become a set of
kind of service providers

00:01:42.067 --> 00:01:44.434
in the middle that act
on behalf of the user

00:01:44.434 --> 00:01:46.000
out to all the websites
across the web

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.234
that want to be social.

00:01:47.234 --> 00:01:48.834
And there'll be sites
that want to act

00:01:48.834 --> 00:01:50.234
as your identity provider
so, you know--

00:01:50.234 --> 00:01:51.634
okay, I've already got
an account.

00:01:51.634 --> 00:01:53.200
And I said there would be sites

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.534
that would want to act
as your social graph provider.

00:01:55.534 --> 00:01:57.601
So I've already got an address
book or a friends list.

00:01:57.601 --> 00:01:59.400
I don't want to have to recreate
that everywhere I go.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.133
And that there would be sites
that would act

00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:03.901
as content aggregators
that would be able

00:02:03.901 --> 00:02:05.400
to let you see the activity
from you and your friends

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.067
all over the web,
and that these would create

00:02:07.067 --> 00:02:09.701
kind of a symbiotic ecosystem
that made it a lot easier

00:02:09.701 --> 00:02:11.501
for new sites
to come up and be social

00:02:11.501 --> 00:02:13.834
and let users come and find
those sites.

00:02:13.834 --> 00:02:15.601
And then in particular
this would enable kind of

00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:18.501
a virtuous cycle where
if it's really easy for me

00:02:18.501 --> 00:02:20.100
to go check out some new site

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.167
because I don't have to sign up
and put in a new password

00:02:22.167 --> 00:02:24.033
and fill out a new profile
and upload a photo

00:02:24.033 --> 00:02:25.234
and all that stuff,

00:02:25.234 --> 00:02:26.367
and if it's really easy
to bring in

00:02:26.367 --> 00:02:28.434
my existing social graph
and find out who I know

00:02:28.434 --> 00:02:29.934
on that site--maybe
it's a niche site

00:02:29.934 --> 00:02:31.868
that not everyone I know
is going to be interested in

00:02:31.868 --> 00:02:33.267
but a few people are--

00:02:33.267 --> 00:02:35.300
then I can start to have
an experience there right away,

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.200
and it lowers that barrier
to trying something new.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.567
And if then when I do create
some activity there,

00:02:40.567 --> 00:02:43.000
I make a review or I author
some content or what have you,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.167
if that can flow back out
into my aggregator

00:02:45.167 --> 00:02:46.901
and all my other friends
who aren't part of that site

00:02:46.901 --> 00:02:49.234
can see it, they not only learn
about what I'm doing

00:02:49.234 --> 00:02:50.467
but they learn about the site.

00:02:50.467 --> 00:02:52.200
And if they can then
go and do it themselves,

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.934
you can see there's this
really nice, virtuous cycle,

00:02:53.934 --> 00:02:55.834
at least in theory,
that should allow lots

00:02:55.834 --> 00:02:58.100
of new websites to grow
and quickly flourish

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.234
by reducing a lot of friction
all around.

00:03:01.234 --> 00:03:05.200
And then later that year,
it became clear that while each

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.767
of those individual pieces
was useful, there was something

00:03:07.767 --> 00:03:09.934
really magical about putting
them all together.

00:03:09.934 --> 00:03:11.767
And that the--
sort of being both the way

00:03:11.767 --> 00:03:14.067
that I can go into the website
and bring my identity

00:03:14.067 --> 00:03:16.434
and my contacts
and pull information back,

00:03:16.434 --> 00:03:17.834
that there was sort of a whole

00:03:17.834 --> 00:03:19.167
that was more than the sum
of its parts.

00:03:19.167 --> 00:03:20.968
And that was also reflected
in the technology.

00:03:20.968 --> 00:03:22.667
There were all these
independent projects

00:03:22.667 --> 00:03:24.300
that were started
for very different reasons

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.868
but all sort of started
to come together

00:03:25.868 --> 00:03:28.067
into what we sort of loosely
called the Open Stack.

00:03:28.067 --> 00:03:30.501
And that a term that sort of
people seemed to latch on to.

00:03:30.501 --> 00:03:32.534
'Cause it was like, yeah,
there's a bunch of stuff here

00:03:32.534 --> 00:03:35.000
where it's not individual
companies just with platforms.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.367
It's really a set
of technologies,

00:03:36.367 --> 00:03:38.200
kind of like a set of protocols
like the web itself.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.434
It was gonna allow
all this creativity to happen

00:03:40.434 --> 00:03:43.267
in the social dimension.

00:03:43.267 --> 00:03:45.434
And so it's interesting
to go back and say,

00:03:45.434 --> 00:03:46.601
"Okay, that was last year.

00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:47.834
What's happened since then?"

00:03:47.834 --> 00:03:48.868
And I'm sure if you guys
if you guys

00:03:48.868 --> 00:03:50.334
have been paying attention
at all,

00:03:50.334 --> 00:03:51.834
you've seen there's just
a flurry.

00:03:51.834 --> 00:03:54.968
Yahoo's whole YOS strategy
is completely based on this.

00:03:54.968 --> 00:03:57.167
Windows Live is now
a sort of aggregator

00:03:57.167 --> 00:03:58.400
and--take your information
around.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.968
Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, AOL--
the list goes on,

00:04:00.968 --> 00:04:03.601
all being OpenID providers
for all of their users.

00:04:03.601 --> 00:04:04.901
And on and on.

00:04:04.901 --> 00:04:06.267
And then Facebook, right?
Facebook Connect.

00:04:06.267 --> 00:04:07.434
Very much this same model.

00:04:07.434 --> 00:04:09.501
Not exactly the same technology
under the hood,

00:04:09.501 --> 00:04:10.834
but exactly the same concepts.

00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:12.567
MySpace, same thing.

00:04:12.567 --> 00:04:14.434
MySpace ID--
like Facebook Connect,

00:04:14.434 --> 00:04:16.167
but in fact all the Open Stack
under the hood.

00:04:16.167 --> 00:04:17.701
And then most recently,

00:04:17.701 --> 00:04:19.334
Facebook getting involved
in OpenID as well.

00:04:19.334 --> 00:04:21.667
So even bringing the Open Stack
around to everybody.

00:04:21.667 --> 00:04:23.234
So just a real flurry
of activity.

00:04:23.234 --> 00:04:25.200
Google supporting portable
contacts recently too.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.000
And of course FriendConnect
being this thing

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.400
that allows you
to take that information out

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.234
to any website and immediately
drop it in.

00:04:30.234 --> 00:04:31.901
So the little guys actually
have an advantage

00:04:31.901 --> 00:04:34.467
over the big guys
a lot of times.

00:04:34.467 --> 00:04:36.334
And as that was all happening,

00:04:36.334 --> 00:04:38.767
all of these trends
were just having great success.

00:04:38.767 --> 00:04:41.267
So this is, you know,
JanRain tracks the number

00:04:41.267 --> 00:04:44.634
of unique relying parties
of sites you can go using OpenID

00:04:44.634 --> 00:04:46.200
and it just continues to go up
and up and up.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.767
There's a Wiki that tries
to keep track

00:04:49.767 --> 00:04:51.767
of all the different sites
that have OAuth enabled APIs,

00:04:51.767 --> 00:04:53.834
so ways to access your private
data without having

00:04:53.834 --> 00:04:55.968
to give away your password
in a standard way.

00:04:55.968 --> 00:04:57.501
And as you can see
I can't even fit the list

00:04:57.501 --> 00:04:59.601
on the screen anymore.

00:04:59.601 --> 00:05:02.100
This is a snapshot of some
of the feeds

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.667
that you can share
into Plaxo Pulse,

00:05:03.667 --> 00:05:06.434
sort of one of the first
web-wide aggregators.

00:05:06.434 --> 00:05:08.634
And again, not only
has the number of places

00:05:08.634 --> 00:05:10.434
that have feeds
really expanded,

00:05:10.434 --> 00:05:12.200
but the number of really
mainstream sites.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.934
You can get your Netflix
reviews.

00:05:13.934 --> 00:05:15.267
You can get the stories
you think are interesting

00:05:15.267 --> 00:05:16.534
on "The New York Times."

00:05:16.534 --> 00:05:17.801
There's all this sort of stuff
that you can do

00:05:17.801 --> 00:05:19.701
that is really interesting
to real mainstream users

00:05:19.701 --> 00:05:21.934
as well as all the early
web 2.0 stuff

00:05:21.934 --> 00:05:23.100
that pioneered this.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.868
And OpenSocial, I mean,
what a radical concept.

00:05:26.868 --> 00:05:29.467
OpenSocial only started publicly

00:05:29.467 --> 00:05:32.901
a few months before last year's
Google I/O talk.

00:05:32.901 --> 00:05:35.767
And not only did they get all
of these different big sites

00:05:35.767 --> 00:05:36.934
as a community to come together
to say,

00:05:36.934 --> 00:05:38.400
"Yes, let's have a standard
platform

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.100
"for building these social
applications.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.701
Let's not have the browser wars
but worse."

00:05:42.701 --> 00:05:44.801
It's now deployed
on enough sites

00:05:44.801 --> 00:05:46.434
that, collectively speaking,
it's hitting

00:05:46.434 --> 00:05:48.367
hundreds and hundreds
of millions of users.

00:05:48.367 --> 00:05:50.434
So again,
very mainstream adoption

00:05:50.434 --> 00:05:52.167
in a very short period of time
of these new technologies.

00:05:52.167 --> 00:05:53.667
Just to me, that--
really extraordinary

00:05:53.667 --> 00:05:56.667
to watch that
pace of innovation.

00:05:56.667 --> 00:05:58.434
So when I take that
all together,

00:05:58.434 --> 00:06:01.300
seems very clear to me,
and I hope it's clear to you,

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.200
that the whole web
is going social

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.067
and the social web
is going open.

00:06:07.067 --> 00:06:09.400
And that's a pretty fundamental
transformation.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.167
In fact, a lot of people,
I think,

00:06:11.167 --> 00:06:14.734
feel that it's as fundamental
as the birth of the web itself--

00:06:14.734 --> 00:06:16.434
where you had this sort
of new paradigm,

00:06:16.434 --> 00:06:18.434
this new ecosystem
that was gonna foster

00:06:18.434 --> 00:06:20.400
just an absolutely rapid
amount of innovation

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.968
because the protocols
themselves

00:06:21.968 --> 00:06:23.767
were fundamentally open
to anybody with a good idea

00:06:23.767 --> 00:06:25.701
to come in and play.

00:06:25.701 --> 00:06:27.834
And so there's a lot of things
you can now do

00:06:27.834 --> 00:06:29.200
to take advantage of that.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.467
And so I want to show you
throughout most of this talk

00:06:30.467 --> 00:06:32.901
is all the things you can
actually go do today

00:06:32.901 --> 00:06:35.200
and that people are doing
to start to live

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.667
in this new social ecosystem.

00:06:36.667 --> 00:06:38.634
Because even though this has
been happening so rapidly,

00:06:38.634 --> 00:06:40.634
or maybe because it's been
happening so rapidly,

00:06:40.634 --> 00:06:42.501
I think a lot of people
haven't really woken up

00:06:42.501 --> 00:06:44.934
to just how much of the stuff
is actually real,

00:06:44.934 --> 00:06:47.434
how much of it is actually
suitable for mainstream users,

00:06:47.434 --> 00:06:50.234
and how powerful it can be
for your applications.

00:06:50.234 --> 00:06:52.200
And so four things I want to
just sort of focus on

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.234
is areas that can add value
to your services right now.

00:06:55.234 --> 00:06:58.501
One is how to streamline
your sign-up flow.

00:06:58.501 --> 00:06:59.767
So how to make it easy
for new people to come

00:06:59.767 --> 00:07:01.133
and find out your app
without having to create

00:07:01.133 --> 00:07:03.400
yet another account, another
password, another profile,

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.033
photo, on and on and on.

00:07:05.033 --> 00:07:07.467
Putting and end to what we call
refriend madness,

00:07:07.467 --> 00:07:10.100
which is not having to refriend
the same person

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.467
everywhere you go.

00:07:11.467 --> 00:07:13.634
So you can say, "Yes,
I've already made friends here.

00:07:13.634 --> 00:07:15.868
Let me use that existing
friends list on this new site."

00:07:15.868 --> 00:07:18.934
Getting rid of the password
anti-pattern,

00:07:18.934 --> 00:07:20.467
which is where sites
ask you for your password

00:07:20.467 --> 00:07:22.434
to another service in order
to access data

00:07:22.434 --> 00:07:24.033
on your behalf, right?

00:07:24.033 --> 00:07:25.734
That's obviously sort
of scary

00:07:25.734 --> 00:07:27.300
from a security and privacy
perspective.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.400
And scraping is also,
technically speaking,

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.801
kind of ugly and breaks a lot.

00:07:30.801 --> 00:07:33.467
But until there were good
robust APIs and standards,

00:07:33.467 --> 00:07:35.334
there often wasn't
an alternative for doing

00:07:35.334 --> 00:07:36.601
real deep integrations.

00:07:36.601 --> 00:07:38.167
And so now we're finally
getting to the point

00:07:38.167 --> 00:07:40.434
where the safe and secure way
is actually better

00:07:40.434 --> 00:07:42.167
than the insecure way.

00:07:42.167 --> 00:07:44.300
And then finally,
what I call

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.167
"riding that virtuous cycle
of social discovery."

00:07:46.167 --> 00:07:48.601
So being able to actually
have your app go through

00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:50.767
that loop where more people
can discover it and share it

00:07:50.767 --> 00:07:53.167
with their friends, and they can
come find it and so forth.

00:07:53.167 --> 00:07:56.000
And so I thought rather
than just talking,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.467
I would try to show you
as many demos of this

00:07:57.467 --> 00:07:59.234
in the wild as I could,

00:07:59.234 --> 00:08:01.634
and then sort of talk through
what's actually going on

00:08:01.634 --> 00:08:02.934
under the hood so you'll get
a sense of sort

00:08:02.934 --> 00:08:04.868
of what this really means
and hopefully be fodder

00:08:04.868 --> 00:08:07.300
for some more detailed Q and A.

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.334
And I invite you to go
as high level

00:08:09.334 --> 00:08:10.834
or low level technical
as you like.

00:08:10.834 --> 00:08:13.434
This is what I do for a living
and I love it, so...

00:08:13.434 --> 00:08:15.267
The first thing I thought
I would start with

00:08:15.267 --> 00:08:16.701
is something--and most of these

00:08:16.701 --> 00:08:18.334
I've demoed at one time
or another before.

00:08:18.334 --> 00:08:20.467
There's nothing that
you'll probably hear or see

00:08:20.467 --> 00:08:22.100
for the first time,
but if you're like most people,

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.634
it's hard enough to keep track
of all these things.

00:08:23.634 --> 00:08:25.234
So hopefully everyone
will see something

00:08:25.234 --> 00:08:26.701
sort of new
and interesting here.

00:08:26.701 --> 00:08:29.434
The first one is an integration
that we did with Google

00:08:29.434 --> 00:08:32.234
using a hybrid of the OpenID
and OAuth protocols

00:08:32.234 --> 00:08:35.133
for an easy way for Google users
to sign up for Plaxo.

00:08:35.133 --> 00:08:38.033
But it would work with anybody
that supported these standards.

00:08:38.033 --> 00:08:40.801
So let me jump over
to my trusty web browser.

00:08:40.801 --> 00:08:42.801
Okay, so here I am.

00:08:42.801 --> 00:08:45.834
I'm Hong and my friend Joseph
has invited me to join Plaxo.

00:08:45.834 --> 00:08:47.601
This is like
any initiation email

00:08:47.601 --> 00:08:48.934
you get to any social service.

00:08:48.934 --> 00:08:50.601
But what's interesting,
when I click on it

00:08:50.601 --> 00:08:53.734
to go sign up--
well, gosh darn it.

00:08:53.734 --> 00:08:55.634
It's already starting
to do this thing here.

00:08:55.634 --> 00:09:00.067
Let me quickly go in and see
if I can regenerate this.

00:09:00.067 --> 00:09:07.200
As I say, live demos are always
a little bit masochistic.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.834
Hold a second.

00:09:08.834 --> 00:09:14.601
I'll have to also see how flaky
the Internet is or not.

00:09:14.601 --> 00:09:17.534
Let me try sending this guy
another invite.

00:09:24.033 --> 00:09:26.968
All right.

00:09:31.667 --> 00:09:34.934
I think probably I tested
this invite before.

00:09:34.934 --> 00:09:37.467
Okay, so here's
a shiny new invite.

00:09:37.467 --> 00:09:42.801
I've already signed out--yeah.

00:09:42.801 --> 00:09:45.434
Okay, so like a normal invite,

00:09:45.434 --> 00:09:47.000
but because the user came
from Gmail,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.801
we were able to recognize
that, oh, you know,

00:09:49.801 --> 00:09:51.367
there's a better way to sign up
with your Google account.

00:09:51.367 --> 00:09:52.968
Sign up in just a few clicks.

00:09:52.968 --> 00:09:54.901
And so we're able to give the
person a custom landing page.

00:09:54.901 --> 00:09:56.100
And if the user wants to,

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.634
the can go through
our normal sign-up flow.

00:09:57.634 --> 00:09:59.901
But if they click the sign-up
with my Google account button,

00:09:59.901 --> 00:10:01.801
we actually take them over
to Google

00:10:01.801 --> 00:10:03.934
and we say, "Hey,
we'd like some information

00:10:03.934 --> 00:10:05.334
from you to get started."

00:10:05.334 --> 00:10:06.834
And the cool thing
is we were able

00:10:06.834 --> 00:10:08.033
to tell that they were
a Google user

00:10:08.033 --> 00:10:10.234
because they got invited
to a gmail.com address.

00:10:10.234 --> 00:10:13.567
And they're actually already
logged into Google

00:10:13.567 --> 00:10:15.501
because they just came
from Gmail, right?

00:10:15.501 --> 00:10:17.234
So it's a very smooth
experience.

00:10:17.234 --> 00:10:19.400
And you can see it says, "Plaxo
is asking for some information

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.667
"about this user.

00:10:20.667 --> 00:10:22.133
"They'd like your name
and email address,

00:10:22.133 --> 00:10:23.367
"the language you speak,

00:10:23.367 --> 00:10:25.334
and access
to your address book."

00:10:25.334 --> 00:10:28.767
And with one click,
I can say "Okay, sounds good."

00:10:28.767 --> 00:10:30.634
You're now taken back to Plaxo

00:10:30.634 --> 00:10:32.267
and behind the scenes
we create an account for you

00:10:32.267 --> 00:10:34.167
that's tied to your Google
account, so there's no need

00:10:34.167 --> 00:10:36.300
for you to create
a Plaxo-specific password.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.801
And as long as you're signed
in to Google,

00:10:37.801 --> 00:10:39.634
you'll be able to stay
signed into Plaxo.

00:10:39.634 --> 00:10:40.934
And so the first thing
I can do

00:10:40.934 --> 00:10:42.067
when I get into the app,
rather than having

00:10:42.067 --> 00:10:43.300
to get another sign-up form,

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:44.868
is I can just answer
that invitation.

00:10:44.868 --> 00:10:47.400
So I can say--in Plaxo you can
connect to people separately

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.133
as family, friend,
and business,

00:10:49.133 --> 00:10:51.067
and share different things
with those different people.

00:10:51.067 --> 00:10:53.067
So in this case
I'm going to be his friend.

00:10:53.067 --> 00:10:55.467
And then normally the next step
we would take you to

00:10:55.467 --> 00:10:56.701
is well, let's import
your address book.

00:10:56.701 --> 00:10:58.100
Do you use Google, Yahoo?

00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:59.767
The standard thing you've seen
a zillion times.

00:10:59.767 --> 00:11:01.501
But here, because again
we know that they're Google,

00:11:01.501 --> 00:11:03.300
and they already gave us access
to their address book

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.734
on that previous step,
we can just immediately say,

00:11:05.734 --> 00:11:07.534
"Okay, well, gee, let's go see
which of your Google friends

00:11:07.534 --> 00:11:08.968
use Plaxo here."

00:11:08.968 --> 00:11:10.167
And so we can pull
in their address book

00:11:10.167 --> 00:11:12.767
and match it up against
the list of Plaxo users.

00:11:12.767 --> 00:11:14.367
And again, the next thing
that they actually see

00:11:14.367 --> 00:11:16.734
that they can do is--
here's a bunch of people

00:11:16.734 --> 00:11:18.534
that you know that you
can start to connect with.

00:11:18.534 --> 00:11:20.934
Right?
So just a very quick interface.

00:11:20.934 --> 00:11:22.534
I'm not typing anything.
I'm just clicking through.

00:11:22.534 --> 00:11:24.000
And I'm immediately doing
what I want to do

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.400
which is starting
to use the app.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.801
So and this goes on through.

00:11:29.801 --> 00:11:31.234
I guess the last thing
to sort of show you

00:11:31.234 --> 00:11:32.534
that's sort of cool
about this,

00:11:32.534 --> 00:11:35.767
the standard connect invite,
et cetera.

00:11:35.767 --> 00:11:37.467
Connect to friends of friends,
et cetera.

00:11:37.467 --> 00:11:45.100
And get some basic
extra information.

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:48.200
And when we land--the person
gets landed in the app,

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.701
we show them this little thing
that says,

00:11:49.701 --> 00:11:51.767
hey, next time
you come back to Plaxo,

00:11:51.767 --> 00:11:53.634
you can just click
sign in with a Google account

00:11:53.634 --> 00:11:55.968
and you won't have to type
in a Plaxo password.

00:11:55.968 --> 00:11:57.234
It'll just remember.

00:11:57.234 --> 00:11:58.667
If you're not signed
into Google currently,

00:11:58.667 --> 00:11:59.968
it'll make you sign in.

00:11:59.968 --> 00:12:01.100
But if you are signed
into Google,

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:02.200
it'll just be magic.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.701
And in fact,
if you come back to Plaxo

00:12:03.701 --> 00:12:05.400
and you're already signed
into Gmail,

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.667
you just will be signed in.

00:12:06.667 --> 00:12:08.868
You know, any site
will tell you that not only

00:12:08.868 --> 00:12:10.567
is getting users to sign up
and get through

00:12:10.567 --> 00:12:12.400
that whole sign-up process--
you get a lot of drop off

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.467
and a lot of friction there,

00:12:13.467 --> 00:12:15.434
but lost passwords
are a huge problem

00:12:15.434 --> 00:12:16.534
for any consumer service.

00:12:16.534 --> 00:12:17.834
You haven't logged in
in a while

00:12:17.834 --> 00:12:18.834
and you don't remember
what your password is.

00:12:18.834 --> 00:12:20.067
Well, we get rid of all of that

00:12:20.067 --> 00:12:21.701
because you're always
gonna be signed in

00:12:21.701 --> 00:12:24.267
to Gmail
if you're a Gmail user.

00:12:24.267 --> 00:12:25.601
So that's a good example.

00:12:25.601 --> 00:12:28.033
And this is something
we went live with

00:12:28.033 --> 00:12:31.234
just a couple of months ago.

00:12:31.234 --> 00:12:33.367
And so under the hood, again,

00:12:33.367 --> 00:12:35.000
so what's happening
is because it's been sent

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.033
to a Gmail.com address,
we realize, oh, okay,

00:12:37.033 --> 00:12:38.601
that's a Google user.

00:12:38.601 --> 00:12:39.801
That's likely to be someone
who could log in

00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:41.701
with a Google OpenID.

00:12:41.701 --> 00:12:43.667
And when we send them over,

00:12:43.667 --> 00:12:45.167
one of the things you could do

00:12:45.167 --> 00:12:47.767
when you're asking for somebody
to log in with OpenID--which,

00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:49.367
again, if you're not familiar
with that basic concept,

00:12:49.367 --> 00:12:51.868
it's like, I've already got
an account over on Google.

00:12:51.868 --> 00:12:54.067
I just want to have Google
prove to Plaxo

00:12:54.067 --> 00:12:55.901
that yes, this really
is that user.

00:12:55.901 --> 00:12:57.567
And then it can trust
that--okay, well, in that case,

00:12:57.567 --> 00:12:59.567
I'll make an account based
on that credential.

00:12:59.567 --> 00:13:02.334
It's just in this case my
sort of Google URL as you will,

00:13:02.334 --> 00:13:04.400
my own user URL.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.501
But you can ask
for additional data

00:13:06.501 --> 00:13:08.367
to come across
with that transaction.

00:13:08.367 --> 00:13:09.467
So instead of just saying,

00:13:09.467 --> 00:13:11.234
"Yes, this really is
Joseph at Gmail,"

00:13:11.234 --> 00:13:12.734
it can also say, "By the way,

00:13:12.734 --> 00:13:14.400
can you give me some basic
profile data?"

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.634
In this case, also,
"Hey, could you give me

00:13:16.634 --> 00:13:19.000
an OAuth token
to access their address book?"

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.534
So OAuth by itself
is this nice protocol

00:13:21.534 --> 00:13:23.367
where similarly you can sort
of bounce the person over

00:13:23.367 --> 00:13:25.567
to a site and say, "Hey, could
you give this person access

00:13:25.567 --> 00:13:26.868
to some of your data?"

00:13:26.868 --> 00:13:28.367
But you don't have
to give away your password.

00:13:28.367 --> 00:13:29.934
You don't have to give away
all the rights to your data.

00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:31.067
You can just give away
a piece.

00:13:31.067 --> 00:13:32.701
Like, maybe they can access
my address book

00:13:32.701 --> 00:13:33.901
but not my calendar,
or they can read

00:13:33.901 --> 00:13:36.100
to it but not write to it.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:37.834
And so I can ask
for that OAuth token

00:13:37.834 --> 00:13:39.567
as part of
the OpenID round trip.

00:13:39.567 --> 00:13:41.200
That's the so-called
hybrid piece of it,

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.934
'cause it's sort of combining
them together into one step.

00:13:42.934 --> 00:13:44.367
And so the nice thing
is that the user

00:13:44.367 --> 00:13:46.901
then literally just has
to push that one button,

00:13:46.901 --> 00:13:48.767
and all of a sudden
we get, you know,

00:13:48.767 --> 00:13:50.634
the fact
that they're a Google user.

00:13:50.634 --> 00:13:52.000
We get the verified email
address,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.133
so no need to send them
that email

00:13:53.133 --> 00:13:54.133
and say, "Hey, could you
click on this

00:13:54.133 --> 00:13:55.601
and prove you really are?"

00:13:55.601 --> 00:13:57.601
Because obviously Google's
the authority for Gmail.com,

00:13:57.601 --> 00:13:59.200
so if they tell us
that's the right user,

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.567
we have to trust them.

00:14:00.567 --> 00:14:02.334
And we get the address book
to be able

00:14:02.334 --> 00:14:03.567
to start doing the import.

00:14:03.567 --> 00:14:05.300
So really just
cutting friction down.

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:07.167
And like I said,
portable contacts

00:14:07.167 --> 00:14:10.033
is the standard way
of using OAuth

00:14:10.033 --> 00:14:11.067
to get access
to address book data,

00:14:11.067 --> 00:14:12.300
which Google also supports.

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.767
And so what's neat about this
is we actually

00:14:13.767 --> 00:14:16.267
didn't write a line of Google
specific code to do this.

00:14:16.267 --> 00:14:17.901
It's just that Google
was first out

00:14:17.901 --> 00:14:20.300
with all of this implementation
on their side.

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:21.501
So that's how it works.

00:14:21.501 --> 00:14:22.834
Now you could ask
the question, of course--

00:14:22.834 --> 00:14:25.267
so is this actually something
that moves the needle

00:14:25.267 --> 00:14:26.934
on a consumer service?

00:14:26.934 --> 00:14:29.534
Well, we're
a very empirical company,

00:14:29.534 --> 00:14:31.467
like I'm sure most startups
these days have to be.

00:14:31.467 --> 00:14:33.267
And so we see that
when given the choice

00:14:33.267 --> 00:14:34.734
to sign up with your Google
account versus

00:14:34.734 --> 00:14:36.667
signing up with
a regular account,

00:14:36.667 --> 00:14:38.367
people choose that
predominantly.

00:14:38.367 --> 00:14:39.701
And the completion rate
of saying,

00:14:39.701 --> 00:14:40.868
"Yes, I'm gonna sign up
with a Google account,"

00:14:40.868 --> 00:14:43.133
versus abandoning if you
just show the person

00:14:43.133 --> 00:14:45.734
the normal sign-up form
is considerably lower.

00:14:45.734 --> 00:14:48.767
So it starts out better
but then it really gets going.

00:14:48.767 --> 00:14:50.634
So of the users we send off
to Google,

00:14:50.634 --> 00:14:52.267
there's always this worry
that you're gonna send them off

00:14:52.267 --> 00:14:54.167
to some other website
and they'll never come back.

00:14:54.167 --> 00:14:55.834
Well, because you're already
signed into Google,

00:14:55.834 --> 00:14:58.100
you've been conditioned
by the landing page

00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.501
to understand you're gonna
go sign in to Google,

00:14:59.501 --> 00:15:00.801
so you're not jarred by it.

00:15:00.801 --> 00:15:02.234
It's a friendly page
that shows the little

00:15:02.234 --> 00:15:04.300
Plaxo and Google logos
together.

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:05.601
It says what you're giving out.

00:15:05.601 --> 00:15:07.100
Like, it's not scary.
It's very sensible.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.033
So a whopping 92% of people
that we send off

00:15:10.033 --> 00:15:11.434
click and come back.

00:15:11.434 --> 00:15:12.734
That's an astoundingly
high figure.

00:15:12.734 --> 00:15:14.467
Getting 92% of people
to follow anything

00:15:14.467 --> 00:15:17.067
even on your site is hard,
right?

00:15:17.067 --> 00:15:19.067
And so what that means
is that far from this becoming

00:15:19.067 --> 00:15:21.300
the chasm of death where
you lose the person,

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:23.734
we actually get people
to come back in droves.

00:15:23.734 --> 00:15:26.434
And then, of course, they import
much more successfully

00:15:26.434 --> 00:15:28.300
because we don't have
to ask them for a password

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:29.868
or remember what service they
use or all that kind of stuff.

00:15:29.868 --> 00:15:31.534
The contacts just come over.

00:15:31.534 --> 00:15:33.634
And so, as a result,
because they've got more data

00:15:33.634 --> 00:15:35.467
and they're less fatigued,
they end up doing

00:15:35.467 --> 00:15:37.100
a lot more connection
and invitation

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.601
and filling out data
and all that good stuff

00:15:38.601 --> 00:15:39.868
you want your users to do

00:15:39.868 --> 00:15:42.400
than a comparable user who came
through the normal flow.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.000
So it just moves all
of the metrics across.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.601
And the cool thing is that they
even come back more often.

00:15:47.601 --> 00:15:49.467
Because even though they have
to do this sign in

00:15:49.467 --> 00:15:50.868
with your Google account,
which is a little bit different

00:15:50.868 --> 00:15:52.100
than what they're used to,

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.067
they're just signed in most
of the time

00:15:54.067 --> 00:15:55.167
'cause they're already
signed in to Google.

00:15:55.167 --> 00:15:56.334
Or if they're not,

00:15:56.334 --> 00:15:57.801
they definitely remember
their Google password

00:15:57.801 --> 00:15:59.601
even if they don't remember
their Plaxo one normally.

00:15:59.601 --> 00:16:02.267
So we actually get better
return visits as well.

00:16:02.267 --> 00:16:04.400
And so the funny thing
is we originally did this

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.000
as an experiment
just to kind of test

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.667
how far we'd come along.

00:16:07.667 --> 00:16:09.300
And once we saw how good
the results are,

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:10.534
the business guys at Plaxo

00:16:10.534 --> 00:16:12.234
wouldn't let us shut
the experiment down.

00:16:12.234 --> 00:16:14.033
'Cause they were like,
"No, no, no, no, no."

00:16:14.033 --> 00:16:15.667
We're like, "Well, we want
to try some different things."

00:16:15.667 --> 00:16:17.567
This is great, you know?

00:16:17.567 --> 00:16:19.467
So it's actually now 100%
of people who get invited

00:16:19.467 --> 00:16:22.067
to add Gmail.com addresses
now go through this flow.

00:16:22.067 --> 00:16:23.767
And it's doing great things
for us,

00:16:23.767 --> 00:16:25.400
and the users love it,
and Google uses it, right?

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:26.934
Loves it 'cause we're
not scraping them.

00:16:26.934 --> 00:16:28.467
We're not being insecure.

00:16:28.467 --> 00:16:30.934
And the Google user
now gets more value

00:16:30.934 --> 00:16:32.200
out of having a good Google
account,

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.133
a good address book up to date.

00:16:34.133 --> 00:16:35.868
So I hope that's a good kind
of concrete example

00:16:35.868 --> 00:16:39.067
of how this interoperability
based on these open standards

00:16:39.067 --> 00:16:42.367
can really be effective and
also be really user friendly

00:16:42.367 --> 00:16:43.767
as opposed to some of the--

00:16:43.767 --> 00:16:45.067
if you played with it maybe
a year ago,

00:16:45.067 --> 00:16:46.734
a lot of it was still sort of
geeky and confusing.

00:16:46.734 --> 00:16:48.634
But with this number
of mainstream companies

00:16:48.634 --> 00:16:50.601
really working on it now,
the user experience

00:16:50.601 --> 00:16:53.667
is something
that's very rapidly improving.

00:16:53.667 --> 00:16:54.868
Okay, so that's...

00:16:54.868 --> 00:16:57.801
Oh, and then the thing
I alluded to earlier

00:16:57.801 --> 00:17:00.267
that's extra cool
is because this is all based

00:17:00.267 --> 00:17:02.434
on open standards
and this was not a, like,

00:17:02.434 --> 00:17:04.267
Plaxo/Google cabal,

00:17:04.267 --> 00:17:06.367
anybody else who supports this,
it works.

00:17:06.367 --> 00:17:08.734
So MySpace also supports
the hybrid OpenID

00:17:08.734 --> 00:17:10.367
OAuth log-in and portable
contacts.

00:17:10.367 --> 00:17:12.167
And so I literally took
this code

00:17:12.167 --> 00:17:14.534
and pointed it at MySpace
once they told me it was ready

00:17:14.534 --> 00:17:15.901
and it just worked
the first time.

00:17:15.901 --> 00:17:18.133
That's pretty miraculous
when you think about it.

00:17:18.133 --> 00:17:19.934
The idea that the marginal cost

00:17:19.934 --> 00:17:22.067
of implementing with a new site
could be that small

00:17:22.067 --> 00:17:23.634
means that we're much more
likely to work with

00:17:23.634 --> 00:17:25.534
a lot more sites
and a lot smaller sites

00:17:25.534 --> 00:17:27.868
because that barrier of
is the bang for the buck

00:17:27.868 --> 00:17:30.167
of integrating specifically
with a big site

00:17:30.167 --> 00:17:32.501
like MySpace or
a small, more niche site

00:17:32.501 --> 00:17:34.734
completely changes
that equation.

00:17:34.734 --> 00:17:36.334
And Plaxo's not the only one
doing this now.

00:17:36.334 --> 00:17:39.000
So if you--FriendFeed
is another sort of real time

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.300
aggregation kind of service.

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:41.801
And if you go to their
homepage now,

00:17:41.801 --> 00:17:43.267
you'll see that they have
these, you know,

00:17:43.267 --> 00:17:45.267
sign up and find your friends
with one click.

00:17:45.267 --> 00:17:46.634
Technically it's two clicks.

00:17:46.634 --> 00:17:47.634
We call it two-click sign-up.

00:17:47.634 --> 00:17:48.901
They call it one-click sign-up.

00:17:48.901 --> 00:17:51.534
It's a marketing thing,
I guess.

00:17:51.534 --> 00:17:53.167
With Facebook and in Google
and in Twitter.

00:17:53.167 --> 00:17:55.467
So what's nice is that
other people

00:17:55.467 --> 00:17:56.934
are playing both sides
of the roles, right?

00:17:56.934 --> 00:17:59.100
MySpace and Google swap out
of Plaxo and FriendFeed

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.934
and FriendFeed
could do MySpace too.

00:18:00.934 --> 00:18:02.667
So it's all--
works out of the box.

00:18:02.667 --> 00:18:04.400
And then, I guess,
the one more thing there

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.133
is if you saw last week,
Facebook's now doing this too.

00:18:07.133 --> 00:18:10.033
So Facebook started testing
OpenID support

00:18:10.033 --> 00:18:11.834
on Facebook where,
among other things,

00:18:11.834 --> 00:18:13.067
they work with this
Google flow.

00:18:13.067 --> 00:18:14.467
So you can sign up
for a Facebook account

00:18:14.467 --> 00:18:16.067
really easily and then
you'll stay logged

00:18:16.067 --> 00:18:17.767
into Facebook if you're logged
into your Google account.

00:18:17.767 --> 00:18:20.133
So really impressive
to see how mainstream

00:18:20.133 --> 00:18:21.534
this is becoming.

00:18:21.534 --> 00:18:23.267
And it's just unequivocally
good for everybody.

00:18:23.267 --> 00:18:25.634
It's a classic case of just
removing inefficiency

00:18:25.634 --> 00:18:29.834
from the system
and everybody wins.

00:18:29.834 --> 00:18:31.634
And so I thought
to sort of pair with this,

00:18:31.634 --> 00:18:33.100
I'd show you a MySpace
version of it too

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:37.601
so you can start
to see the pattern here.

00:18:37.601 --> 00:18:39.367
And like I said,
if you have questions

00:18:39.367 --> 00:18:41.734
as you come along or--
I know I talk a little bit fast.

00:18:41.734 --> 00:18:43.267
I get kind of excited
about what I'm saying,

00:18:43.267 --> 00:18:45.000
so please feel free
to jump in at any time.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.200
Okay, so here's a little demo
site called 8-Bit Music.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.367
And the idea is it's
a niche social site

00:18:50.367 --> 00:18:53.133
for people who really like
the video game soundtracks.

00:18:53.133 --> 00:18:54.767
You know, the little, like,
MIDI, "Do do do do."

00:18:54.767 --> 00:18:56.400
That kind of stuff, right?

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.901
And so it's the kind of site
that won't appeal to everyone,

00:18:59.901 --> 00:19:02.467
but there's a loyal subset
of people

00:19:02.467 --> 00:19:03.801
that would think this
is really cool.

00:19:03.801 --> 00:19:04.801
But it's exactly
the kind of site

00:19:04.801 --> 00:19:06.000
where it's like, oh, man.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.601
I got to sign up for yet
another account

00:19:07.601 --> 00:19:09.534
and fill out yet another profile
and find all my friends.

00:19:09.534 --> 00:19:12.267
It might be hard for a site
like that to thrive

00:19:12.267 --> 00:19:14.834
in a world where everybody
had to do all that from scratch.

00:19:14.834 --> 00:19:17.267
But instead they've got this
nice log in with MySpace button.

00:19:17.267 --> 00:19:18.901
And so it just pops up again.

00:19:18.901 --> 00:19:20.067
They do it with a pop up,

00:19:20.067 --> 00:19:21.667
so not even taking you away
from the page,

00:19:21.667 --> 00:19:23.100
a sort of very friendly thing.

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:24.634
And, you know, if I weren't
signed in to MySpace

00:19:24.634 --> 00:19:26.334
it would ask me for
my log-in and password.

00:19:26.334 --> 00:19:28.968
But it's a MySpace.com URL,

00:19:28.968 --> 00:19:31.100
so 8-Bit Music never sees
my password.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:32.400
And in this case
I'm already logged in,

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.200
so it's just as easy to say,
"Yes, this is me."

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.667
And you can see it's got
that same friendly UI

00:19:36.667 --> 00:19:39.467
where it's got the 8-Bit Music
logo and the MySpace logo

00:19:39.467 --> 00:19:40.834
so I can see what's going on.

00:19:40.834 --> 00:19:44.000
And as soon as I continue,
then again they get--

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.634
It's hybrid OpenID and OAuth
and so boom, I'm in the site.

00:19:46.634 --> 00:19:48.501
Here's my name, here's my photo,
here's all my information,

00:19:48.501 --> 00:19:50.133
and I can start to find people
and share things.

00:19:50.133 --> 00:19:53.234
So it's just really,
really easy to start doing this.

00:19:53.234 --> 00:19:54.701
And that really increases
the chances

00:19:54.701 --> 00:19:57.701
for small sites like this
to grow and thrive.

00:20:01.901 --> 00:20:04.567
And that's
8bitmusic.jdavid.net

00:20:04.567 --> 00:20:05.901
if you want to play
with that demo yourself.

00:20:05.901 --> 00:20:08.167
I should mention
all of these slides--

00:20:08.167 --> 00:20:09.467
I think Google I/O
is going to put them up,

00:20:09.467 --> 00:20:11.434
but I'll also have them up
on my website

00:20:11.434 --> 00:20:13.501
which is josephsmarr.com.

00:20:13.501 --> 00:20:15.834
And so I'll put it up
when this talk is over

00:20:15.834 --> 00:20:17.100
so you guys can
get a copy that way.

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:19.667
And I'm also jsmarr
on Twitter if you want

00:20:19.667 --> 00:20:20.834
tweet out or follow
or whatever.

00:20:20.834 --> 00:20:23.667
It should be easy
to get ahold of me.

00:20:23.667 --> 00:20:25.000
Okay, so that was about--

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.901
how do you streamline
the sign-up process?

00:20:26.901 --> 00:20:29.033
And that's very important.

00:20:29.033 --> 00:20:31.901
But there's still the problem
of now do I want to--

00:20:31.901 --> 00:20:33.267
I could import
my address book,

00:20:33.267 --> 00:20:35.434
but am I still friending
each person again on each site?

00:20:35.434 --> 00:20:37.100
And it's obviously the case

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:39.634
that you don't necessarily want
everyone you know

00:20:39.634 --> 00:20:41.467
to follow you around
on every site you go to.

00:20:41.467 --> 00:20:42.667
Like, I have different
spheres of my life.

00:20:42.667 --> 00:20:44.067
Everybody else does too.

00:20:44.067 --> 00:20:45.567
And it's partly
a privacy thing

00:20:45.567 --> 00:20:47.334
but it's also partly just
a signal annoyance thing, right?

00:20:47.334 --> 00:20:49.234
I don't want to bug all
of my colleagues

00:20:49.234 --> 00:20:51.000
that I'd normally talk
about OpenID stuff with

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.400
with my personal hobbies

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.868
that they may not
be interested in.

00:20:53.868 --> 00:20:55.968
And so you basically
would like to be able

00:20:55.968 --> 00:20:57.534
to have a situation
where you can say--

00:20:57.534 --> 00:21:01.434
in some cases, if it's
a friendly site,

00:21:01.434 --> 00:21:02.601
maybe I want to say
well, gee,

00:21:02.601 --> 00:21:04.000
if we're already friends
on Facebook,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.167
why don't we just have that
be a transitive thing?

00:21:06.167 --> 00:21:07.501
We can be friends here
as well

00:21:07.501 --> 00:21:10.033
and in other cases be able
to just pick a subset.

00:21:10.033 --> 00:21:12.100
And until recently that really
hasn't been possible.

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:14.267
But we did a pretty
substantial integration

00:21:14.267 --> 00:21:17.367
with Facebook Connect recently
where I think we started to--

00:21:17.367 --> 00:21:20.234
sort of
changed that a little bit.

00:21:20.234 --> 00:21:24.667
So let's go back to--
let's see here.

00:21:24.667 --> 00:21:25.968
Let's go back to that site.

00:21:25.968 --> 00:21:29.634
Here I am, and I just joined
with this account

00:21:29.634 --> 00:21:32.534
that I created from my Google
I'm importing.

00:21:32.534 --> 00:21:36.501
So now let me go
into my Facebook.

00:21:36.501 --> 00:21:39.334
And I'll say okay, well, maybe
I can connect with Facebook.

00:21:39.334 --> 00:21:41.334
And I said let me not only see
which of my friends use it

00:21:41.334 --> 00:21:43.834
but I can share content back
and forth between the two sites.

00:21:43.834 --> 00:21:45.901
And so again,
nice little pop-up.

00:21:45.901 --> 00:21:47.868
In this case you can see
it's not even a pop-up.

00:21:47.868 --> 00:21:49.501
It's a little AJAX Lightbox,

00:21:49.501 --> 00:21:52.667
because we've got some
Facebook JavaScript on my page

00:21:52.667 --> 00:21:54.167
and they've got a little
hidden iFrame over

00:21:54.167 --> 00:21:55.767
to their site so they can tell

00:21:55.767 --> 00:21:57.434
I'm currently logged
in to Facebook.

00:21:57.434 --> 00:21:59.801
And so there's no need
to actually pop up

00:21:59.801 --> 00:22:01.567
a physical pop-up
with a separate domain

00:22:01.567 --> 00:22:03.000
'cause they're not taking
any credentials.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.067
So it can be an even more
streamlined experience.

00:22:05.067 --> 00:22:06.767
It's interesting,
you know, the full page,

00:22:06.767 --> 00:22:08.200
to the pop-up,
to the now the--in line.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.400
And again, same thing, right?

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.534
I hope you're getting
a pattern here.

00:22:10.534 --> 00:22:11.667
Plaxo and Facebook--
do you want

00:22:11.667 --> 00:22:13.067
to share information,
yes or no?

00:22:13.067 --> 00:22:14.300
So it's a pattern
I think the users

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:15.534
are gonna be able to learn
and apply

00:22:15.534 --> 00:22:17.400
across different websites.

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:21.567
And so when I connect,
now Plaxo says,

00:22:21.567 --> 00:22:24.067
"Okay, so now you tell me
how you want to use

00:22:24.067 --> 00:22:25.534
your Plaxo and Facebook
accounts together,"

00:22:25.534 --> 00:22:26.801
because some people
want it differently.

00:22:26.801 --> 00:22:28.434
So the first one says,
"Automatically connect me

00:22:28.434 --> 00:22:30.868
with my Facebook friends
who also use Plaxo."

00:22:30.868 --> 00:22:32.601
So that's this case
that says,

00:22:32.601 --> 00:22:33.968
hey, if we're already friends
on Plaxo--

00:22:33.968 --> 00:22:36.467
sorry, if we're already
friends on Facebook

00:22:36.467 --> 00:22:39.300
and we both have connected
our Facebook and Plaxo accounts,

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:40.767
don't make us reconnect.

00:22:40.767 --> 00:22:42.534
Let's just, you know,
that's good enough.

00:22:42.534 --> 00:22:43.834
We already said
we were friends.

00:22:43.834 --> 00:22:45.767
And if you don't like that,
don't choose it.

00:22:45.767 --> 00:22:47.767
But a lot of people
find that to be very convenient.

00:22:47.767 --> 00:22:49.501
And then it says--
do you want to share things

00:22:49.501 --> 00:22:51.400
back and forth between
the two sites?

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.434
And so when you go to do that,

00:22:53.434 --> 00:22:55.734
because it's a deeper level
of integration,

00:22:55.734 --> 00:22:58.467
Facebook says, "Well,
let me make sure

00:22:58.467 --> 00:22:59.934
the user really wants this."

00:22:59.934 --> 00:23:01.767
So they ask for a couple of
extra permissions.

00:23:01.767 --> 00:23:03.267
And this is a nice sort
of model where

00:23:03.267 --> 00:23:04.501
rather than having
to give the user

00:23:04.501 --> 00:23:06.167
ten check boxes up front,

00:23:06.167 --> 00:23:07.868
you sort of wait
for the user to interact

00:23:07.868 --> 00:23:09.501
with the app and,
as necessary,

00:23:09.501 --> 00:23:11.601
you can escalate the amount
of control that they have

00:23:11.601 --> 00:23:12.968
so that it's really easy
to get started

00:23:12.968 --> 00:23:15.334
but you don't end up
giving away the farm too early.

00:23:15.334 --> 00:23:17.200
So this first says
make sure--

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.634
is it okay
if Plaxo knows who I am,

00:23:18.634 --> 00:23:21.400
not just for now but ongoing
so they can sync things

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.734
in the background
and what have you?

00:23:22.734 --> 00:23:23.968
Okay, sure.

00:23:23.968 --> 00:23:26.334
And then the second one says,
is it okay

00:23:26.334 --> 00:23:28.167
if you can take the things
you're sharing in Facebook

00:23:28.167 --> 00:23:30.234
and also share that with
my friends over on Plaxo?

00:23:30.234 --> 00:23:32.634
And you can see again, it's a
very nice visual representation.

00:23:32.634 --> 00:23:34.000
This is actually,
this says,

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.601
"Getting ready to demo it
at Google I/O."

00:23:35.601 --> 00:23:37.901
You can't see it but it's
the real data that I've had.

00:23:37.901 --> 00:23:39.834
So it's very easy
for me to tell

00:23:39.834 --> 00:23:42.167
what I'm getting myself into.

00:23:42.167 --> 00:23:44.467
And so when I allow that,
then it goes, okay.

00:23:44.467 --> 00:23:45.901
So the permission's been saved

00:23:45.901 --> 00:23:48.434
and so, here, let me go
and set this all up together...

00:23:48.434 --> 00:23:50.968
and wait for the Internet
which has been

00:23:50.968 --> 00:23:54.767
pretty cooperative
but not the fastest.

00:23:54.767 --> 00:23:57.100
Wait for it.

00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:58.601
Yay!

00:23:58.601 --> 00:24:00.567
So now my settings
have been saved.

00:24:00.567 --> 00:24:05.734
And if I go back
to my homepage now...

00:24:07.634 --> 00:24:10.868
Skip the opportunity to expand
my network since I just did.

00:24:10.868 --> 00:24:13.067
You'll see that now I've
not only connected

00:24:13.067 --> 00:24:15.033
my Facebook account but
you can see I'm now connected

00:24:15.033 --> 00:24:16.467
to four more people.

00:24:16.467 --> 00:24:18.067
So these were all people
who were my friends

00:24:18.067 --> 00:24:20.334
over on Facebook and I'll
apologize for the names.

00:24:20.334 --> 00:24:21.667
These are all sort
of test accounts.

00:24:21.667 --> 00:24:23.968
But conceptually, these
are four of my Facebook friends

00:24:23.968 --> 00:24:26.267
who I may not have realized
were even on Plaxo,

00:24:26.267 --> 00:24:27.968
but because we all connected
our accounts like this

00:24:27.968 --> 00:24:29.067
now we're friends
on Plaxo too.

00:24:29.067 --> 00:24:30.300
And I didn't have to go
through the work

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:31.467
of bugging them each time.

00:24:31.467 --> 00:24:32.801
"Hey, do you also want
to be friends on Plaxo?"

00:24:32.801 --> 00:24:34.634
Because they all said,
"Yes, I'm cool with that."

00:24:34.634 --> 00:24:37.467
And so again the result
is I start to get content here.

00:24:37.467 --> 00:24:39.167
So here's a friend--
my friend Anita

00:24:39.167 --> 00:24:41.467
shared some photos on Facebook,
and they're coming across

00:24:41.467 --> 00:24:43.167
and I'm seeing them in Plaxo.

00:24:43.167 --> 00:24:45.934
And here's a video that they
shared and I can play it.

00:24:45.934 --> 00:24:47.868
If I want to watch it it takes
me right over to Facebook.

00:24:47.868 --> 00:24:50.300
So it's a very nice, tight
interaction between the two.

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:54.734
Yeah?

00:24:54.734 --> 00:24:56.801
The question is is the content
replicated in each site?

00:24:56.801 --> 00:24:58.167
The raw content's not.

00:24:58.167 --> 00:24:59.868
So you can see here
I'm actually over on Facebook.

00:24:59.868 --> 00:25:01.434
So it's more like sort
of the feed

00:25:01.434 --> 00:25:03.334
of the information comes across.

00:25:03.334 --> 00:25:05.934
But we watch it every so often,
so if it changes

00:25:05.934 --> 00:25:07.601
we can change it on our side
as well.

00:25:07.601 --> 00:25:09.400
So if you decide
to make something private,

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:10.934
then it goes away
everywhere else.

00:25:10.934 --> 00:25:13.033
But it allows you to see it
even where you're not there.

00:25:13.033 --> 00:25:16.634
So that's another example
of how, again,

00:25:16.634 --> 00:25:18.267
any website not only has
a hard time

00:25:18.267 --> 00:25:19.734
getting users to start
signing up,

00:25:19.734 --> 00:25:21.067
they have an even harder time

00:25:21.067 --> 00:25:23.267
getting them build to build
that--a rich social graph.

00:25:23.267 --> 00:25:24.567
And this makes it a lot easier.

00:25:24.567 --> 00:25:26.534
And you may have seen,
since this went live,

00:25:26.534 --> 00:25:27.834
it also went--

00:25:27.834 --> 00:25:30.133
Digg did a somewhat similar
integration

00:25:30.133 --> 00:25:32.868
where you sort of automatically
follow all of your--

00:25:32.868 --> 00:25:35.367
the subset of your Facebook
users who are also Digg users.

00:25:35.367 --> 00:25:37.534
And so that to me
was a really cool example

00:25:37.534 --> 00:25:39.200
because I always used
to tell people, you know,

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.000
isn't it weird that here I am

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.601
in the middle of Silicon Valley,
and everyone I know uses Digg

00:25:44.601 --> 00:25:46.300
but I have, like, 
three friends on Digg,

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:48.033
and so I don't see what any
of those people are Digging

00:25:48.033 --> 00:25:49.767
because it's just too much work

00:25:49.767 --> 00:25:52.534
to, like, go through and build
yet another curated friends list

00:25:52.534 --> 00:25:53.868
just on Digg, right?

00:25:53.868 --> 00:25:55.467
But if it can happen
automatically

00:25:55.467 --> 00:25:57.100
through a site like Facebook
that I've already gone

00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:58.801
and built up a set of--
social graph,

00:25:58.801 --> 00:26:00.367
now it's actually
a much richer experience

00:26:00.367 --> 00:26:01.701
when I go to Digg.

00:26:01.701 --> 00:26:03.634
It's not just kind of
what random 13-year-olds

00:26:03.634 --> 00:26:05.334
across the world thought
was a cool story.

00:26:05.334 --> 00:26:07.534
It's what the people I actually
know and care about

00:26:07.534 --> 00:26:08.834
thought was a cool story,

00:26:08.834 --> 00:26:10.834
which is a much more
interesting, filtered view.

00:26:10.834 --> 00:26:13.834
And so that whole being able
to lower the friction

00:26:13.834 --> 00:26:15.801
of getting that data to move

00:26:15.801 --> 00:26:17.133
all of a sudden means
that you can get

00:26:17.133 --> 00:26:18.601
a lot more engaging
experiences

00:26:18.601 --> 00:26:20.734
and get your users
into a much happier state

00:26:20.734 --> 00:26:22.534
without having to make them
do so much work.

00:26:22.534 --> 00:26:28.000
So that's really
the payoff here.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.901
And so again,
on the backend,

00:26:29.901 --> 00:26:31.434
this really wasn't
too hard to do.

00:26:31.434 --> 00:26:33.300
So essentially what
we have to do is

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:34.601
when somebody connects
their Facebook account

00:26:34.601 --> 00:26:37.133
and Plaxo account, we just have
a little database table

00:26:37.133 --> 00:26:39.067
that stores a mapping
between their Facebook ID

00:26:39.067 --> 00:26:40.534
and their Plaxo ID.

00:26:40.534 --> 00:26:42.234
And then we store the little
session key they give us,

00:26:42.234 --> 00:26:43.634
which is kind
of like an OAuth token

00:26:43.634 --> 00:26:46.334
that allows us to make API calls
on the person's behalf.

00:26:46.334 --> 00:26:48.801
And then we can pull down
their friends list,

00:26:48.801 --> 00:26:51.200
which is essentially just
a list of other Facebook IDs.

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.567
And we can intersect that
with our mapping table

00:26:53.567 --> 00:26:55.834
and see which of the subset
of your Facebook friends

00:26:55.834 --> 00:26:57.901
have also connected their
accounts, and that's the set

00:26:57.901 --> 00:26:59.934
of Plaxo users that
we can auto connect you to.

00:26:59.934 --> 00:27:01.367
And we just check
the preference

00:27:01.367 --> 00:27:03.567
to see if both sides said
"Yes, auto connect me."

00:27:03.567 --> 00:27:05.033
And if so, we do.

00:27:05.033 --> 00:27:06.601
And we also--
I didn't show you this,

00:27:06.601 --> 00:27:08.934
but you get a little
notification in Plaxo,

00:27:08.934 --> 00:27:11.234
like, if somebody comments on
one of your photos or whatever

00:27:11.234 --> 00:27:13.033
about each person
that you've connected with.

00:27:13.033 --> 00:27:14.434
So if you decide,
oh, gee, I'm friends

00:27:14.434 --> 00:27:15.968
with that person on Facebook

00:27:15.968 --> 00:27:18.067
but I'm not really sure I want
to be their friend on Plaxo,

00:27:18.067 --> 00:27:20.000
you can just go in right there
and change it

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.868
to business
instead of friend

00:27:21.868 --> 00:27:23.200
or get rid of it or whatever.

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:25.033
You're never surprised
by what's happening.

00:27:25.033 --> 00:27:26.200
It's very seamless.

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.667
And for most people
most of the time

00:27:27.667 --> 00:27:30.167
they're pretty cool with keeping
the friends list the same.

00:27:30.167 --> 00:27:32.834
But it allows you to kind
of curate it on the fly.

00:27:32.834 --> 00:27:34.400
And then what we do
is we basically have

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.434
a demon that runs
in the background every--

00:27:36.434 --> 00:27:39.033
whatever it is, few hours,
that checks, you know,

00:27:39.033 --> 00:27:41.234
hey, do you have any new friends
on Facebook?

00:27:41.234 --> 00:27:43.000
Well, let's see if
they're Plaxo members.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.834
Or have you unfriended anybody
on Facebook?

00:27:44.834 --> 00:27:47.367
Have some of your friends
since connected

00:27:47.367 --> 00:27:48.968
their Plaxo and Facebook
accounts?

00:27:48.968 --> 00:27:50.267
And so it just runs
in the background

00:27:50.267 --> 00:27:51.701
and does that algorithm
over and over again.

00:27:51.701 --> 00:27:53.801
And so the cool thing is
as more and more people

00:27:53.801 --> 00:27:56.300
hook up their accounts
I just get friended to them.

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:57.501
And as more and more people
join Facebook

00:27:57.501 --> 00:27:58.834
I get connected to them.

00:27:58.834 --> 00:28:00.300
And so the benefit to me
as a user

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:02.234
and also the benefit
to Plaxo is not just

00:28:02.234 --> 00:28:04.367
a one time thing like
when you do a one time import.

00:28:04.367 --> 00:28:06.801
It actually keeps getting better
over time.

00:28:06.801 --> 00:28:09.267
And so you get
a marginal return

00:28:09.267 --> 00:28:10.601
for that one time
investment.

00:28:10.601 --> 00:28:12.701
And so that's a really powerful
model because

00:28:12.701 --> 00:28:15.501
especially if you think
about new sites that are small,

00:28:15.501 --> 00:28:17.434
you may come as an early adopter
and try to use it

00:28:17.434 --> 00:28:18.934
and not find a lot
of your friends there.

00:28:18.934 --> 00:28:20.701
But over time a bunch more
people are gonna join

00:28:20.701 --> 00:28:22.334
and you'd really like that
to be able

00:28:22.334 --> 00:28:23.834
to bring you back to the site

00:28:23.834 --> 00:28:25.601
and give you more reasons
to keep interacting

00:28:25.601 --> 00:28:28.100
with it and so now you can.

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:31.000
And then Facebook has
this open stream API

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.734
which is another use of Facebook
using open standards.

00:28:33.734 --> 00:28:34.801
They've really gotten
on the bandwagon

00:28:34.801 --> 00:28:36.267
which is so awesome.

00:28:36.267 --> 00:28:38.234
So there's another building
block which wasn't even

00:28:38.234 --> 00:28:40.934
in that Open Stack diagram
from last year

00:28:40.934 --> 00:28:42.667
called activity streams
which is a sort of

00:28:42.667 --> 00:28:44.534
a standard way of doing
rich metadata

00:28:44.534 --> 00:28:47.234
around shared a video or posted
a photo or what have you.

00:28:47.234 --> 00:28:49.167
And so we can--
it's a protected feed

00:28:49.167 --> 00:28:50.501
but we got
the access from the user,

00:28:50.501 --> 00:28:52.534
that second permission
dialogue you saw,

00:28:52.534 --> 00:28:54.734
so we can suck that out
and then share it privately

00:28:54.734 --> 00:28:56.334
with the user's Plaxo friends.

00:28:56.334 --> 00:28:58.000
And I think
what's crucial there

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.334
is that--notice that I didn't
have to make the data public

00:29:01.334 --> 00:29:03.701
just to make it portable,
right?

00:29:03.701 --> 00:29:05.868
So I'm specifically
wanting to share

00:29:05.868 --> 00:29:08.234
nonpublic things with
my friends and family.

00:29:08.234 --> 00:29:09.467
It's just that some of them

00:29:09.467 --> 00:29:11.267
are on Facebook and some
of them are on Plaxo.

00:29:11.267 --> 00:29:12.667
And I don't really want
to have to make

00:29:12.667 --> 00:29:13.834
all of my Facebook friends
join Plaxo

00:29:13.834 --> 00:29:15.834
or all of my Plaxo friends
join Facebook.

00:29:15.834 --> 00:29:17.601
I just want to be able
to put stuff up

00:29:17.601 --> 00:29:19.367
and share it to friends
in both places.

00:29:19.367 --> 00:29:20.434
I just don't want
to have to make it public

00:29:20.434 --> 00:29:21.601
to share it with everybody.

00:29:21.601 --> 00:29:23.167
And with this sort of secure
data portability

00:29:23.167 --> 00:29:24.667
you really can do that.

00:29:24.667 --> 00:29:26.300
And so that's a really
powerful thing

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:28.467
that, you know, a lot of
the success of early web 2.0

00:29:28.467 --> 00:29:30.400
came from just getting around
all these

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:32.033
tricky identity and privacy
problems

00:29:32.033 --> 00:29:33.300
by making everything public.

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:34.667
But that's not really
what most people want

00:29:34.667 --> 00:29:35.868
when you think about it.

00:29:35.868 --> 00:29:38.067
And so now you don't have
to do that.

00:29:38.067 --> 00:29:41.601
Okay, and then presumably

00:29:41.601 --> 00:29:43.000
you've been seeing this
all along.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.734
But you never saw me
type a password in once, right?

00:29:44.734 --> 00:29:46.133
And that's really cool
especially when

00:29:46.133 --> 00:29:47.934
you're using a tablet PC
because handwriting recognition

00:29:47.934 --> 00:29:49.701
for passwords is pretty bad.

00:29:49.701 --> 00:29:51.367
It doesn't really look
like an English word.

00:29:51.367 --> 00:29:54.701
And so I wanted to show you
an example on FriendFeed's site.

00:29:54.701 --> 00:29:56.400
I think they've done
a particularly good job.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:57.934
They've got, uh, this--
you know,

00:29:57.934 --> 00:29:59.801
Like all these sites, they have
a little friend finder.

00:29:59.801 --> 00:30:01.734
But rather than asking
for passwords everywhere,

00:30:01.734 --> 00:30:03.234
they've got this nice
streamlined interface

00:30:03.234 --> 00:30:04.834
where it just takes you over
to the other site

00:30:04.834 --> 00:30:07.300
and then shows you the people
you might want to connect with.

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:09.267
So you can see here they've got
Facebook, Twitter,

00:30:09.267 --> 00:30:11.267
Gmail, Yahoo, and Hotmail.

00:30:11.267 --> 00:30:13.801
And some of these are using
open standards

00:30:13.801 --> 00:30:15.100
and some of them aren't,

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:16.801
but to the user it all
kind of works the same.

00:30:16.801 --> 00:30:18.901
And hopefully over time
as more and more people support

00:30:18.901 --> 00:30:21.300
these open standards
it'll be less and less work

00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:22.834
for sites like FriendFeed
to support

00:30:22.834 --> 00:30:25.100
and they'll be able to support
more and more additional sites.

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:28.234
But conceptually if I go
to--let's do Yahoo this time.

00:30:28.234 --> 00:30:31.968
So Yahoo makes me log in
each time

00:30:31.968 --> 00:30:34.767
because they're a little bit
more paranoid.

00:30:34.767 --> 00:30:36.534
Probably for a good reason.

00:30:36.534 --> 00:30:38.534
And then they show me a bit
of a scarier page,

00:30:38.534 --> 00:30:39.534
but it's the same thing.

00:30:39.534 --> 00:30:40.667
It's like, hey, is it okay

00:30:40.667 --> 00:30:43.334
if FriendFeed has access
to your information?

00:30:43.334 --> 00:30:45.267
But then once I bounce back
it's the same thing.

00:30:45.267 --> 00:30:47.234
It's OAuth and boom.
You can see how fast it is.

00:30:47.234 --> 00:30:49.067
Here's a bunch
of my Yahoo contacts

00:30:49.067 --> 00:30:50.834
that I might want to follow
on FriendFeed.

00:30:50.834 --> 00:30:55.701
Now if instead I decide
let's use Gmail,

00:30:55.701 --> 00:30:56.868
it's the same thing, right?

00:30:56.868 --> 00:30:59.801
So it's just very seamless.

00:30:59.801 --> 00:31:01.400
It's actually a lot nicer

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.334
than having to type passwords
in because I happen

00:31:03.334 --> 00:31:04.767
to already be logged
into those other sites.

00:31:04.767 --> 00:31:06.767
If you're taking passwords,
you don't get the value

00:31:06.767 --> 00:31:08.501
of the person
already being logged in

00:31:08.501 --> 00:31:09.501
whereas here you do.

00:31:09.501 --> 00:31:10.667
And they do Facebook as well.

00:31:10.667 --> 00:31:12.868
And even Facebook has
their own kind of--

00:31:12.868 --> 00:31:14.200
It's not OAuth.
It's their own version.

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:18.367
But it's conceptually
very similar, right?

00:31:18.367 --> 00:31:20.033
Yeah, yeah, so the fact
that those other sites

00:31:20.033 --> 00:31:22.133
aren't asking me for passwords
is because I happen to already

00:31:22.133 --> 00:31:23.534
be logged into them,

00:31:23.534 --> 00:31:25.100
and if I weren't logged in
I would have to log in.

00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:26.334
But at least I'm giving
my password only

00:31:26.334 --> 00:31:27.868
to the sites
that have my data

00:31:27.868 --> 00:31:30.334
and I'm never giving a password
to FriendFeed in either case.

00:31:30.334 --> 00:31:31.501
Right?
Does that make sense?

00:31:31.501 --> 00:31:32.701
So that's a lot more secure
for me

00:31:32.701 --> 00:31:34.567
because if I don't trust
FriendFeed

00:31:34.567 --> 00:31:37.834
then I can always say
they can't have access later.

00:31:37.834 --> 00:31:39.734
And I don't have to go change
my password,

00:31:39.734 --> 00:31:41.033
and FriendFeed can't
go and do anything

00:31:41.033 --> 00:31:42.467
other than read
my address book.

00:31:42.467 --> 00:31:44.167
They can't go in and delete
my account or whatever

00:31:44.167 --> 00:31:45.334
which any site you give
your password to

00:31:45.334 --> 00:31:46.667
theoretically could.

00:31:46.667 --> 00:31:47.868
So you really
have to trust them.

00:31:47.868 --> 00:31:49.467
So this is a cool example.

00:31:49.467 --> 00:31:51.634
I just wanted you to see also
that it's not just Plaxo.

00:31:51.634 --> 00:31:54.334
We've obviously been
very eager early adopters

00:31:54.334 --> 00:31:55.767
and evangelists of a lot
of these open standards

00:31:55.767 --> 00:31:57.234
because our service
is all about helping you

00:31:57.234 --> 00:31:58.501
stay in touch
with people across

00:31:58.501 --> 00:32:00.067
all the different services
you use.

00:32:00.067 --> 00:32:01.868
But lots and lots
of other sites are starting

00:32:01.868 --> 00:32:03.200
to use these technologies

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.434
and having great success
with them.

00:32:04.434 --> 00:32:05.501
And I think FriendFeed's
implementation here

00:32:05.501 --> 00:32:09.634
is fantastic.

00:32:09.634 --> 00:32:12.300
And so behind the scenes
one of the things

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:14.033
that's helping a lot here
is that even though

00:32:14.033 --> 00:32:17.234
a lot of these sites
standardized on OAuth

00:32:17.234 --> 00:32:18.834
for being able
to give access to data

00:32:18.834 --> 00:32:20.133
without your password,

00:32:20.133 --> 00:32:21.834
they still all have
their own contacts API.

00:32:21.834 --> 00:32:24.167
So Google had Gdata contacts

00:32:24.167 --> 00:32:26.300
and Yahoo had the Yahoo
address book API

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:28.601
and Microsoft has Windows Live
contacts and whatever.

00:32:28.601 --> 00:32:30.868
And so even though
you could just use

00:32:30.868 --> 00:32:33.000
the code once to get
access to the data,

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.300
you still had to write
separate site-specific code.

00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:37.334
And really to have the kind
of virtuous cycle

00:32:37.334 --> 00:32:38.634
we're talking about,
you really want

00:32:38.634 --> 00:32:41.033
to have the protocols themselves
be open standards

00:32:41.033 --> 00:32:43.033
so that you can talk to someone
you've never heard of before.

00:32:43.033 --> 00:32:44.434
So if you're a small site,

00:32:44.434 --> 00:32:46.334
you don't want to have
to convince FriendFeed

00:32:46.334 --> 00:32:47.667
to add an importer
for your site.

00:32:47.667 --> 00:32:48.767
You just want the user
to be able to say,

00:32:48.767 --> 00:32:50.234
"Hey, I'm on this small site

00:32:50.234 --> 00:32:52.467
but we speak the same standard
so it just works."

00:32:52.467 --> 00:32:55.000
And so portable contacts
is a standard that does that.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.167
And it's basically just
a very simple RESTful API.

00:32:58.167 --> 00:32:59.868
You can learn more
at portablecontacts.net.

00:32:59.868 --> 00:33:03.601
And it exposes--it's basically
vCard data but exposed

00:33:03.601 --> 00:33:06.567
in a more modern way
as are JSON or XML.

00:33:06.567 --> 00:33:08.701
So then it's very easy to go
and get access to that data

00:33:08.701 --> 00:33:10.100
and it's
in the standard format.

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:11.934
And what's cool is
in addition

00:33:11.934 --> 00:33:14.601
to just traditional webmail
address book providers,

00:33:14.601 --> 00:33:16.067
we got together with
the OpenSocial community

00:33:16.067 --> 00:33:18.501
and we standardized
so that OpenSocial,

00:33:18.501 --> 00:33:20.634
which has a much richer set
of requirements around

00:33:20.634 --> 00:33:22.601
building social applications
into websites

00:33:22.601 --> 00:33:23.868
and so forth,
but they have a bunch

00:33:23.868 --> 00:33:25.868
of externally facing APIs,
one of which

00:33:25.868 --> 00:33:28.934
is get my profile data
or get my friends' data,

00:33:28.934 --> 00:33:30.267
which is very much the same.

00:33:30.267 --> 00:33:31.834
And so we were able
to work together

00:33:31.834 --> 00:33:33.501
and wire align
portable contacts

00:33:33.501 --> 00:33:35.467
and the OpenSocial piece
about getting people.

00:33:35.467 --> 00:33:38.200
So any OpenSocial provider
out of the box

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:40.400
is also a portable contacts
provider.

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:41.567
So if you wanted to do import

00:33:41.567 --> 00:33:43.968
from MySpace or Hi5
or Friendster or Orkut

00:33:43.968 --> 00:33:45.901
or any of these sites
that support OpenSocial,

00:33:45.901 --> 00:33:47.334
you can do it the same way
as you can

00:33:47.334 --> 00:33:49.267
from your Gmail contacts.

00:33:49.267 --> 00:33:50.968
So that's very cool to see
that convergence happening.

00:33:50.968 --> 00:33:53.100
And it's all because
we got together and said, hey,

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:56.133
we believe that we can grow
the pie substantially

00:33:56.133 --> 00:33:59.100
for everyone
if we can stop bickering over

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:01.400
the little details of how you
describe a phone number

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:04.033
and focus on building value
higher up in the stack,

00:34:04.033 --> 00:34:06.567
and that's what allowed this
to move.

00:34:06.567 --> 00:34:09.968
And a cool thing,
this guy Sean Sullivan

00:34:09.968 --> 00:34:12.033
who just found out
about portable contacts

00:34:12.033 --> 00:34:14.100
out in the community and--
whipped up an Android app.

00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:15.534
And now you guys all have
your own Android phones,

00:34:15.534 --> 00:34:16.534
maybe you can do this too.

00:34:16.534 --> 00:34:17.767
It's called jpoco.

00:34:17.767 --> 00:34:19.167
And again--
so you could import from

00:34:19.167 --> 00:34:21.234
any portable contacts provider
into your Android phone.

00:34:21.234 --> 00:34:23.167
So here he's doing it
with Plaxo.

00:34:23.167 --> 00:34:24.400
And all of a sudden, boom,

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:25.968
you've got all
my information there, right?

00:34:25.968 --> 00:34:27.667
So it's neat
how people come up--

00:34:27.667 --> 00:34:28.801
We didn't even really anticipate
this use case

00:34:28.801 --> 00:34:29.968
when we thought about
portable contacts,

00:34:29.968 --> 00:34:31.434
but because it's a standard,

00:34:31.434 --> 00:34:32.901
it's so easy for people
to go off and build the stuff

00:34:32.901 --> 00:34:36.400
and anybody can go use it.

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.601
And so the last thing
I wanted to say

00:34:38.601 --> 00:34:40.033
is so now
you're into the site.

00:34:40.033 --> 00:34:41.901
Now you've got
your friends list.

00:34:41.901 --> 00:34:44.000
But what you really want
to complete that virtuous cycle

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.934
is when you're making activity

00:34:45.934 --> 00:34:47.534
or sharing things
on that site,

00:34:47.534 --> 00:34:49.734
you want it to flow back out
into your aggregator of choice,

00:34:49.734 --> 00:34:51.901
whether that's Plaxo or
FriendFeed

00:34:51.901 --> 00:34:53.133
or Facebook or Twitter

00:34:53.133 --> 00:34:55.334
or Windows Live
or Yahoo Updates.

00:34:55.334 --> 00:34:57.267
I mean, pretty much all the
major players have these now.

00:34:57.267 --> 00:34:59.400
And so you'd like the user
to be able to say

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.267
just like, well, wherever
you keep your contacts

00:35:01.267 --> 00:35:02.701
bring them in.

00:35:02.701 --> 00:35:04.267
Wherever you aggregate
your activity,

00:35:04.267 --> 00:35:05.567
send it back out because
that's how

00:35:05.567 --> 00:35:07.234
other people are gonna find out
what's going on

00:35:07.234 --> 00:35:09.167
and come find out
about your site.

00:35:09.167 --> 00:35:11.801
And so I think one
of the coolest implementations

00:35:11.801 --> 00:35:14.467
here is something that Google
made called FriendConnect.

00:35:14.467 --> 00:35:16.200
And FriendConnect does
a lot of cool things

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:19.067
but what it does is
it lets any website

00:35:19.067 --> 00:35:20.534
add social functionality

00:35:20.534 --> 00:35:22.467
buy just copying and pasting
a few lines of JavaScript.

00:35:22.467 --> 00:35:23.767
So sort of like how in AdWords

00:35:23.767 --> 00:35:25.501
you can just easily put ads
on your site,

00:35:25.501 --> 00:35:27.234
with FriendConnect
you can easily put

00:35:27.234 --> 00:35:28.767
social information on your site.

00:35:28.767 --> 00:35:30.334
And Google hosts all the data

00:35:30.334 --> 00:35:32.267
so that you don't have
to do any back end programming.

00:35:32.267 --> 00:35:33.868
You just have to--

00:35:33.868 --> 00:35:35.234
Let me make sure I'm still
signed in properly

00:35:35.234 --> 00:35:37.334
and everything.

00:35:37.334 --> 00:35:40.033
So this is a little site
called My Latest Piece.

00:35:40.033 --> 00:35:41.167
This is like a local artist

00:35:41.167 --> 00:35:42.501
that wants to show off
his stuff.

00:35:42.501 --> 00:35:44.067
And a typical example
of where traditionally

00:35:44.067 --> 00:35:45.701
you'd have just kind of
a standard website

00:35:45.701 --> 00:35:51.367
that doesn't really have
its own programmers

00:35:51.367 --> 00:35:53.434
or ability to build a bunch
of social information

00:35:53.434 --> 00:35:54.634
and all that kind of stuff.

00:35:54.634 --> 00:35:55.834
But with FriendConnect
they just drop in

00:35:55.834 --> 00:35:57.501
this widget,
and so I've signed in here.

00:35:57.501 --> 00:35:58.968
And let's see.

00:35:58.968 --> 00:36:00.400
Maybe I'll show you
the interface.

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:01.834
Let me sign out.

00:36:01.834 --> 00:36:03.334
And you can see these
are little iFrames,

00:36:03.334 --> 00:36:05.167
and so it's just easy for me
to say, "Join this site."

00:36:05.167 --> 00:36:08.434
And then under the hood,
Google's powering this pop-up

00:36:08.434 --> 00:36:10.734
so they get this OpenID
sign-in experience.

00:36:10.734 --> 00:36:12.167
So I'll use my Google account,
so again,

00:36:12.167 --> 00:36:13.601
I don't have to create
a separate account on--

00:36:13.601 --> 00:36:16.767
Let me do a different user.

00:36:16.767 --> 00:36:18.334
On "My Latest Piece,"

00:36:18.334 --> 00:36:20.868
I can use my Google account.

00:36:20.868 --> 00:36:24.534
And then I can also go--

00:36:24.534 --> 00:36:25.834
Now I'm in the site
and I can see which

00:36:25.834 --> 00:36:27.167
of my friends are on
this site.

00:36:27.167 --> 00:36:28.400
So that same cool experience
I showed you

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.000
but with even less work
than it would've taken

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.501
to build it yourself.

00:36:31.501 --> 00:36:33.200
And if I go and look
at my settings,

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.634
what's really cool is not only
can I get into the site,

00:36:35.634 --> 00:36:38.434
I can then hook up the other
tools and services that I use.

00:36:38.434 --> 00:36:40.534
So I can pull in Twitter,
I can pull in LinkedIn,

00:36:40.534 --> 00:36:43.467
I can pull in Plaxo and have
that information on the site.

00:36:43.467 --> 00:36:45.000
And again, Google's done
all the hard work

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.834
behind the scenes
and so the site can just

00:36:46.834 --> 00:36:48.601
sort of take advantage
of having richer profile data

00:36:48.601 --> 00:36:50.067
and more connections.

00:36:50.067 --> 00:36:51.200
But crucially down here
what you can see

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:52.968
is this option:
Publish my activities

00:36:52.968 --> 00:36:55.033
to the sites I've joined
and add to my networks.

00:36:55.033 --> 00:36:57.567
So what that means is if
I share activity on this site,

00:36:57.567 --> 00:36:59.367
it'll go back into
my Plaxo stream.

00:36:59.367 --> 00:37:01.100
So for example, if I say--

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:05.834
Going down here and say...

00:37:05.834 --> 00:37:12.267
"Great piece!
Hi from Google I/O."

00:37:12.267 --> 00:37:13.834
And now you'll know I couldn't
have faked it

00:37:13.834 --> 00:37:15.567
because I wouldn't have known

00:37:15.567 --> 00:37:16.801
that I was gonna be
giving a talk here

00:37:16.801 --> 00:37:18.968
is the theory,
right?

00:37:18.968 --> 00:37:21.100
All right.

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:22.167
You win some, you lose some.

00:37:22.167 --> 00:37:23.767
[laughs]

00:37:23.767 --> 00:37:28.334
O. There we go.

00:37:28.334 --> 00:37:30.200
Okay, and then I'll post
that rating.

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:35.467
And so then my rating
will show up down here.

00:37:35.467 --> 00:37:39.667
Then my rating will show up
down here.

00:37:39.667 --> 00:37:42.501
Hmm, let me refresh that.

00:37:42.501 --> 00:37:43.834
If we were using Wave

00:37:43.834 --> 00:37:47.067
you would've seen it, like,
character by character.

00:37:47.067 --> 00:37:48.734
Oh, yeah, so, "Hi, great piece
from Google I/O."

00:37:48.734 --> 00:37:50.000
So that's cool.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.100
So people on that site
can see that it's me

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:52.501
and they can see
my real photo.

00:37:52.501 --> 00:37:53.767
But then what's really cool

00:37:53.767 --> 00:37:56.801
is I can go back to Plaxo
and let me sign back in

00:37:56.801 --> 00:37:59.734
as my account
that I was using.

00:38:09.534 --> 00:38:10.701
And there it is.

00:38:10.701 --> 00:38:12.000
Joseph posted
on a FriendConnect site.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.067
Joseph wrote a review.

00:38:13.067 --> 00:38:14.167
"Hi, from Google I/O."

00:38:14.167 --> 00:38:15.701
And it's on My Latest Piece.

00:38:15.701 --> 00:38:17.234
And so I've written my friends
and they'll see this.

00:38:17.234 --> 00:38:19.334
They may never have heard
of My Latest Piece, right?

00:38:19.334 --> 00:38:20.701
But they can not only see
that I did this thing.

00:38:20.701 --> 00:38:22.467
They can just click through
and see it over there.

00:38:22.467 --> 00:38:24.634
And then they can come in
and join their account.

00:38:24.634 --> 00:38:26.801
And so that's that virtuous
cycle that I was talking about.

00:38:26.801 --> 00:38:29.133
And the thing to me
that's so cool about this

00:38:29.133 --> 00:38:31.400
is not only does it allow me

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:33.934
to use lots of different
websites and share activity,

00:38:33.934 --> 00:38:36.334
but Plaxo's never heard
of My Latest Piece, right?

00:38:36.334 --> 00:38:38.634
It's not like we wrote
a special plug-in

00:38:38.634 --> 00:38:40.901
to interface with
mylatestpiece.com.

00:38:40.901 --> 00:38:42.367
We'd never heard of them.

00:38:42.367 --> 00:38:44.934
But because it's using
open standards it just works.

00:38:44.934 --> 00:38:47.567
And it's using the OpenSocial
RESTful APIs with OAuth,

00:38:47.567 --> 00:38:49.033
all this same stuff
you keep hearing about.

00:38:49.033 --> 00:38:50.634
And that's what makes it work.

00:38:50.634 --> 00:38:52.100
And what's even cooler then

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:53.501
is that because it's all
open standards,

00:38:53.501 --> 00:38:55.801
Google can go make a service
like FriendConnect

00:38:55.801 --> 00:38:57.934
where anybody could implement
this themselves,

00:38:57.934 --> 00:39:00.100
or you can outsource it
to somebody like Google

00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:02.133
and it all just sort of works.

00:39:02.133 --> 00:39:03.868
That's only possible in a world

00:39:03.868 --> 00:39:05.300
where you have these
open standards.

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:07.734
And this is really
fertile ground.

00:39:07.734 --> 00:39:09.033
Most people are still
not taking advantage

00:39:09.033 --> 00:39:11.200
of this stuff and it is
just gonna be killer

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:12.467
for all of your sites.

00:39:12.467 --> 00:39:13.934
You're gonna wonder,
I think, within a year

00:39:13.934 --> 00:39:15.767
how people possibly thought
that it was reasonable

00:39:15.767 --> 00:39:17.267
to put out a new startup.

00:39:17.267 --> 00:39:18.467
And it's like, all right,
now we just have

00:39:18.467 --> 00:39:19.868
to get 10 million people
to sign up

00:39:19.868 --> 00:39:21.367
and upload photos and connect
to 100 friends

00:39:21.367 --> 00:39:22.734
and share a bunch of activity

00:39:22.734 --> 00:39:24.467
and come back to the site daily
and we'll be set.

00:39:24.467 --> 00:39:26.701
Like, that's such a high bar
when you think about it.

00:39:26.701 --> 00:39:28.868
It's just so hard to do that
on a bunch of different sites.

00:39:28.868 --> 00:39:30.601
And now you don't have to.

00:39:30.601 --> 00:39:32.367
And so I think
that the real benefit

00:39:32.367 --> 00:39:33.634
will be
all the smaller developers

00:39:33.634 --> 00:39:34.934
who can just build these sites

00:39:34.934 --> 00:39:36.367
that can kind of grow
and thrive

00:39:36.367 --> 00:39:38.501
much the way you can link
to lots of different websites.

00:39:38.501 --> 00:39:40.534
And a small website
can be linked to

00:39:40.534 --> 00:39:41.968
just as easily
as a big one.

00:39:41.968 --> 00:39:43.767
Andthen it can start
to rise in relevance,

00:39:43.767 --> 00:39:49.834
except now the data's
moving with it as well.

00:39:49.834 --> 00:39:51.701
And so I mentioned Facebook
a few times.

00:39:51.701 --> 00:39:54.100
A year ago I think
there was a big question mark.

00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:56.133
In fact, when I gave
that talk where I mentioned--

00:39:56.133 --> 00:39:57.467
I didn't show you
the full slide.

00:39:57.467 --> 00:40:00.267
There was the Open Stack piece
and then we sort of said

00:40:00.267 --> 00:40:02.767
well, Facebook,
they're really not doing

00:40:02.767 --> 00:40:04.000
any of
this Open Stack stuff.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.734
Although to be fair,
their own stuff,

00:40:05.734 --> 00:40:07.400
Facebook Connect
and the Facebook platform,

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:09.200
it's conceptually very similar.

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.100
It's still me taking my account
to another site,

00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:13.300
bringing my friends,
sharing activity back.

00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:15.901
And so it certainly is sort
of a similar worldview

00:40:15.901 --> 00:40:17.234
that you'd want to consider.

00:40:17.234 --> 00:40:18.567
It was just sort of annoying
to have to say,

00:40:18.567 --> 00:40:19.901
well, gee, I got to build it
twice,

00:40:19.901 --> 00:40:21.667
once for the Open Stack
and once for Facebook.

00:40:21.667 --> 00:40:24.434
But then a funny thing happened
over the past year.

00:40:24.434 --> 00:40:28.200
Facebook decided gee,
it's time to open up our stream

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:30.467
which many thought was the most
closely guarded

00:40:30.467 --> 00:40:31.934
piece of data on Facebook.

00:40:31.934 --> 00:40:33.868
But they said, no, we're gonna
open it up to developers,

00:40:33.868 --> 00:40:35.801
and what's more, we're gonna
do it in an open standard way

00:40:35.801 --> 00:40:37.267
with activity streams.

00:40:37.267 --> 00:40:41.567
And then they joined
the OpenID foundation

00:40:41.567 --> 00:40:44.801
And then they decided,
well, gee, we're not just gonna

00:40:44.801 --> 00:40:46.167
join the OpenID foundation.

00:40:46.167 --> 00:40:47.934
We're gonna roll out
OpenID ourselves.

00:40:47.934 --> 00:40:51.267
And then not a month later,
the big one--boom.

00:40:51.267 --> 00:40:53.567
Facebook actually supports
OpenID as a relying party

00:40:53.567 --> 00:40:57.133
and does the OpenID and OAuth
and portable contacts

00:40:57.133 --> 00:40:58.801
all rolled into one.

00:40:58.801 --> 00:41:01.567
And so they are very much
in the game now,

00:41:01.567 --> 00:41:03.868
and that's really exciting
because obviously

00:41:03.868 --> 00:41:06.467
Facebook is a huge site
and very innovative

00:41:06.467 --> 00:41:08.634
and they've got a lot of users
and a lot of data.

00:41:08.634 --> 00:41:10.868
And so you as a site
obviously are gonna want people

00:41:10.868 --> 00:41:13.167
who are on Facebook
to come and use it.

00:41:13.167 --> 00:41:15.200
Now it's certainly the case
that Facebook's

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:17.534
not everything on the web,
right?

00:41:17.534 --> 00:41:19.067
In fact if you look at stats
of these sites

00:41:19.067 --> 00:41:20.801
that allow you to log in
from lots of different places,

00:41:20.801 --> 00:41:23.334
what's very interesting is,
"A", the pie chart has

00:41:23.334 --> 00:41:25.334
a lot of big wedges,
so you know,

00:41:25.334 --> 00:41:26.601
there's a lot of Facebook
users share

00:41:26.601 --> 00:41:28.133
but there's also a lot
of MySpace users,

00:41:28.133 --> 00:41:29.567
a lot of Google users,
a lot of Yahoo users,

00:41:29.567 --> 00:41:30.868
what have you.

00:41:30.868 --> 00:41:32.033
And the other thing
that's interesting

00:41:32.033 --> 00:41:34.300
is that the relative sizes
of the wedges

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:37.834
change a lot based on the type
of site that you're going to.

00:41:37.834 --> 00:41:41.601
So I believe on snoopdogg.com,
which accepts OpenID log-ins--

00:41:41.601 --> 00:41:46.300
think about that for a second--
using JanRain's RPX...

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:50.167
then the MySpace
is more predominant.

00:41:50.167 --> 00:41:52.400
But on user voice,
Google's more predominant.

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.534
And on other sites,
Yahoo's more predominant.

00:41:54.534 --> 00:41:56.400
And especially internationally
it's very different.

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:57.734
And so when you think
about that,

00:41:57.734 --> 00:41:59.367
you as a developer,

00:41:59.367 --> 00:42:01.434
especially you as
an individual site owner,

00:42:01.434 --> 00:42:03.400
you really have
no loyalty per se

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:04.634
to one side or the other.

00:42:04.634 --> 00:42:06.000
You just want your users
to be able to come in

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.567
and use whatever data
they already have.

00:42:07.567 --> 00:42:09.801
You don't want to be in
the business of having to say,

00:42:09.801 --> 00:42:11.601
"You can play here
but you can't."

00:42:11.601 --> 00:42:12.767
And so what you really want

00:42:12.767 --> 00:42:13.868
is to be able
to just write it once

00:42:13.868 --> 00:42:15.334
and have it work
across all these websites.

00:42:15.334 --> 00:42:16.534
And so it's very exciting
to see

00:42:16.534 --> 00:42:19.434
more and more companies
converge around this.

00:42:19.434 --> 00:42:21.801
And there's a whole ecosystem
building around this.

00:42:21.801 --> 00:42:24.334
So what I showed you--all
those feeds coming in, right?

00:42:24.334 --> 00:42:26.734
Well, Plaxo, we were one
of the first to do this.

00:42:26.734 --> 00:42:27.968
We had to build it all
ourselves,

00:42:27.968 --> 00:42:30.200
so we had custom agents
and pullers and crawlers.

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:31.501
But now there are these great
startups out there

00:42:31.501 --> 00:42:33.334
like Gnip,
if you haven't heard of them.

00:42:33.334 --> 00:42:34.734
They go out and they figure out
how to get feeds

00:42:34.734 --> 00:42:36.400
from all these different
websites.

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.000
And then they just push it
to you in real time

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.467
and they do
all the scalability stuff.

00:42:39.467 --> 00:42:41.467
So we use them for
a bunch of our feeds

00:42:41.467 --> 00:42:44.734
where we say, like, anytime
somebody publishes on Delicious,

00:42:44.734 --> 00:42:46.868
we know however many
Delicious users

00:42:46.868 --> 00:42:48.734
are also connected into Plaxo.

00:42:48.734 --> 00:42:50.501
And they just ping us
with oh, hey,

00:42:50.501 --> 00:42:52.067
J. Smarr
just saved another bookmark.

00:42:52.067 --> 00:42:54.000
And so it shows up, like,
within a minute in our site

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.734
and doesn't require us
to have load.

00:42:55.734 --> 00:42:57.968
So another benefit
of these standards

00:42:57.968 --> 00:43:00.133
is that it allows for, kind of
like Google FriendConnect,

00:43:00.133 --> 00:43:02.000
it allows for people
to come in and add value

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.501
into the ecosystem even though
they aren't themselves,

00:43:04.501 --> 00:43:06.234
you know, end destination.

00:43:06.234 --> 00:43:08.200
So very exciting to see
how this is all very frothy.

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:09.934
So just to wrap up and then

00:43:09.934 --> 00:43:11.400
we'll have some time
for questions.

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:13.234
As I said at the beginning,

00:43:13.234 --> 00:43:16.067
I hope I've shown you
that the web is going social

00:43:16.067 --> 00:43:18.701
and the social web
is going open.

00:43:18.701 --> 00:43:20.133
And in fact,
I think I can now say it

00:43:20.133 --> 00:43:21.334
even more strongly than that.

00:43:21.334 --> 00:43:23.834
I think that the web
is actually now social

00:43:23.834 --> 00:43:25.767
and the social web
is now open.

00:43:25.767 --> 00:43:27.033
And that means
that it is now time

00:43:27.033 --> 00:43:28.601
for you guys
to actually get involved

00:43:28.601 --> 00:43:30.334
since the only thing
waiting now

00:43:30.334 --> 00:43:32.067
is a bunch more developers
who get it

00:43:32.067 --> 00:43:33.868
who want to push the envelope
and make great sites

00:43:33.868 --> 00:43:35.400
that are easy to use.

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:38.300
So in conclusion, it's time
to start opening your sites up

00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:39.901
to users that already
have accounts.

00:43:39.901 --> 00:43:42.100
You're not the first website
that they're ever used

00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:44.367
and you should start
to take advantage of that.

00:43:44.367 --> 00:43:46.467
Give them a socially-tailored
experience.

00:43:46.467 --> 00:43:47.634
Don't make them start over
from scratch

00:43:47.634 --> 00:43:48.801
with their friends list.

00:43:48.801 --> 00:43:50.234
And then think about how
you can let your users

00:43:50.234 --> 00:43:52.300
syndicate activity back out
into their stream

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:55.501
and let you ride
that virtuous cycle

00:43:55.501 --> 00:43:56.567
'cause it's gonna be
a great ride.

00:43:56.567 --> 00:43:58.167
Thanks a lot.

00:43:58.167 --> 00:44:05.234
[applause]

00:44:05.234 --> 00:44:07.033
And one last comment.

00:44:07.033 --> 00:44:08.234
If you want to stay up
more to date

00:44:08.234 --> 00:44:09.367
with what's going on,

00:44:09.367 --> 00:44:10.801
I know this is a very
fast-moving field.

00:44:10.801 --> 00:44:12.868
One thing we've tried
to do to help is a few of us,

00:44:12.868 --> 00:44:16.367
Dave Recordon and Chris Messina
and John McCrae and I,

00:44:16.367 --> 00:44:18.400
we do a sort of weekly
video podcast

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:20.100
called TheSocialWeb.tv.

00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:22.501
Just sort of quick kind of
10 to 20 minute chunks

00:44:22.501 --> 00:44:24.167
of the latest news
and trying to understand

00:44:24.167 --> 00:44:25.968
what's going on and help
make sense of it in a way

00:44:25.968 --> 00:44:28.868
that's not too technical
but helps bring things out.

00:44:28.868 --> 00:44:30.000
And we often have guests
from the people

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.267
that are building things,
so in addition

00:44:31.267 --> 00:44:34.033
to following me on Twitter
or looking at my blog,

00:44:34.033 --> 00:44:36.167
this I think you'll find
a probably useful resource.

00:44:36.167 --> 00:44:39.000
So I encourage you
to check that out. Yeah.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.934
man: Thank you for
the good presentation.

00:44:42.934 --> 00:44:44.767
I appreciate
the excellent input.

00:44:44.767 --> 00:44:46.601
Quick question.

00:44:46.601 --> 00:44:48.067
In terms of management,

00:44:48.067 --> 00:44:50.834
is there a tool that provides
an integrated view

00:44:50.834 --> 00:44:53.734
over all those sites
so that I don't have

00:44:53.734 --> 00:44:56.534
to go into each container
and manage it separately?

00:44:56.534 --> 00:44:59.234
Smarr: So the question is,
"Yeah, how do you manage?"

00:44:59.234 --> 00:45:01.901
Well, certainly in part
that's what services

00:45:01.901 --> 00:45:03.300
like Plaxo are trying to do.

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:04.434
They're trying to give you
a single place to go

00:45:04.434 --> 00:45:06.067
to see what the friends
you care about

00:45:06.067 --> 00:45:07.467
are sharing
all across the web.

00:45:07.467 --> 00:45:09.767
So if I have Flickr friends,
I can see their photos.

00:45:09.767 --> 00:45:11.634
If I have Picasa people,
I can see their photos.

00:45:11.634 --> 00:45:13.501
I think there's
a lot more work to be done

00:45:13.501 --> 00:45:15.100
above and beyond that
in terms of managing

00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:18.133
permissions
and sharing and notifications

00:45:18.133 --> 00:45:19.367
and a whole bunch
of other stuff.

00:45:19.367 --> 00:45:21.467
And I think that's gonna
be another fruitful area

00:45:21.467 --> 00:45:22.934
of innovation.

00:45:22.934 --> 00:45:24.100
So--and I think
as more people--

00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:25.701
When I think of questions
like this

00:45:25.701 --> 00:45:27.968
I always think of the famous
William Gibson quote.

00:45:27.968 --> 00:45:29.100
"The future is already here.

00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:30.734
It's just not
evenly distributed yet."

00:45:30.734 --> 00:45:31.868
So there are people like me

00:45:31.868 --> 00:45:33.501
who already have
that pain in spades.

00:45:33.501 --> 00:45:34.901
There's still a lot
of other people

00:45:34.901 --> 00:45:36.501
who really aren't using
that many of these tools yet.

00:45:36.501 --> 00:45:37.767
But I think as more
and more people

00:45:37.767 --> 00:45:39.734
find it easier to get into more
and more of these sites,

00:45:39.734 --> 00:45:40.934
tools that help you
manage all that

00:45:40.934 --> 00:45:42.501
are going to become more
and more important.

00:45:42.501 --> 00:45:44.000
I think it's going to be a great
opportunity for innovation.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.234
Yeah.

00:45:45.234 --> 00:45:47.868
man: I saw on Plaxo
that you guys still have

00:45:47.868 --> 00:45:52.701
the either Facebook,
Gmail, Google,

00:45:52.701 --> 00:45:56.601
and even having your own
sign-up registration system.

00:45:56.601 --> 00:45:59.868
Would you advise websites
to actually just do

00:45:59.868 --> 00:46:03.367
Facebook and Google
and not have their own

00:46:03.367 --> 00:46:05.367
registration system anymore?

00:46:05.367 --> 00:46:06.734
Smarr: Yeah,
so good question.

00:46:06.734 --> 00:46:09.067
Is it time to get rid
of my own registration system?

00:46:09.067 --> 00:46:12.834
Well, so a lot of sites that
already have native users,

00:46:12.834 --> 00:46:14.567
like, we have a bunch of users
that already signed up

00:46:14.567 --> 00:46:16.067
for Plaxo before this stuff
came out.

00:46:16.067 --> 00:46:17.567
We have to have some way
for them to log in

00:46:17.567 --> 00:46:19.067
with their
existing credentials.

00:46:19.067 --> 00:46:20.634
For new sites,
I think there are sites--

00:46:20.634 --> 00:46:22.901
like, so there are sites that
have already gone that route.

00:46:22.901 --> 00:46:25.300
There's a cool site for
discussing technical material

00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:28.734
called Stack Overflow
and they're 100% OpenID.

00:46:28.734 --> 00:46:30.300
And there was a cool
social bookmarking site

00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:32.033
called Magnolia
that went 100% OpenID.

00:46:32.033 --> 00:46:34.200
And I think Plaxo,
we'd like to get

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:36.434
to be a 100% relying party
as well.

00:46:36.434 --> 00:46:39.033
So that basically there'd
be no new Plaxo registrations.

00:46:39.033 --> 00:46:40.367
There'd already
be existing sites.

00:46:40.367 --> 00:46:42.133
I think, depending on exactly
what your audience is,

00:46:42.133 --> 00:46:43.601
you have to ask yourself,
you know--

00:46:43.601 --> 00:46:46.033
It's pretty true that probably
pretty much everyone

00:46:46.033 --> 00:46:47.234
has an OpenID
right now because

00:46:47.234 --> 00:46:48.634
all the bigger
portal providers have it,

00:46:48.634 --> 00:46:50.133
but if you think, well, gee,

00:46:50.133 --> 00:46:51.868
maybe my users are particularly
non-technical

00:46:51.868 --> 00:46:53.067
and not likely to have those,

00:46:53.067 --> 00:46:54.501
you might decide
to build your own one.

00:46:54.501 --> 00:46:55.667
But I think it's definitely
getting close

00:46:55.667 --> 00:46:57.133
to the point where
a lot of people could

00:46:57.133 --> 00:46:59.000
just get rid of it altogether
and just say, hey,

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.033
go sign up for a Google account
if you don't have one.

00:47:01.033 --> 00:47:03.400
And the other advantage there
is there's a lot

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:05.934
of stuff you have to do around
managing account creation.

00:47:05.934 --> 00:47:08.033
People try to create spammy
fake accounts and all of that.

00:47:08.033 --> 00:47:09.834
And Google and Yahoo
and all those sites

00:47:09.834 --> 00:47:12.400
have way more detailed
paranoid teams

00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:13.968
figuring out how to track
and trace that stuff.

00:47:13.968 --> 00:47:16.334
And so the advantage
of outsourcing authentication

00:47:16.334 --> 00:47:18.367
to someone who's gonna do
a better job than you and

00:47:18.367 --> 00:47:20.100
they're gonna keep the passwords
more secure and all that.

00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:21.601
It's not just not having
to write the code,

00:47:21.601 --> 00:47:23.067
but it's you actually get
a more secure experience

00:47:23.067 --> 00:47:24.968
at the end so I think
that's another benefit.

00:47:24.968 --> 00:47:26.167
Yeah.

00:47:26.167 --> 00:47:27.767
man: Well, looking
the other way,

00:47:27.767 --> 00:47:31.200
you have many people who have
IDs on multiple sites

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:33.534
that were not OpenID originally.

00:47:33.534 --> 00:47:36.200
Is there some way
they can coordinate those

00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:39.501
so that their accounts
can be linked retroactively?

00:47:39.501 --> 00:47:40.834
Smarr: Yes, there is.

00:47:40.834 --> 00:47:41.868
I'm glad you asked that.

00:47:41.868 --> 00:47:43.467
So it's a good point, right?

00:47:43.467 --> 00:47:45.567
I have lots of URLs
of my profiles around the web.

00:47:45.567 --> 00:47:47.834
They're not all OpenIDs,
and even if they were,

00:47:47.834 --> 00:47:49.300
it would be kind of annoying
to have

00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:53.133
to connect each one
individually.

00:47:53.133 --> 00:47:56.133
And so there's a way you can do
this much more easily.

00:47:56.133 --> 00:47:57.801
One of the things that
people figured out a while ago

00:47:57.801 --> 00:48:00.567
was that you could embed
semantic information

00:48:00.567 --> 00:48:02.834
into the structure of links
on the web themselves,

00:48:02.834 --> 00:48:04.000
a thing called microformats.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.400
So you could put in,
if I have my website

00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:07.067
with contact info
or things like that,

00:48:07.067 --> 00:48:09.200
we do this sort of simple
agreed upon set of CSS classes

00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:11.567
that a computer parser
could come in and grab data.

00:48:11.567 --> 00:48:13.334
And one of those was
if I'm hyperlinking

00:48:13.334 --> 00:48:15.901
from one of my profile pages
to another profile page,

00:48:15.901 --> 00:48:19.033
I can put rel="me"
in the &lt;a&gt; tag

00:48:19.033 --> 00:48:21.334
and that says this is another
profile page about me.

00:48:21.334 --> 00:48:23.601
And then you can follow
those rel="me" links.

00:48:23.601 --> 00:48:25.033
And the idea is so if I can--

00:48:25.033 --> 00:48:27.133
say I use my Google profile
as an OpenID.

00:48:27.133 --> 00:48:29.634
And then it has rel="me"
links to my other profiles.

00:48:29.634 --> 00:48:32.100
I probably couldn't have
spoofed that

00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:33.601
without being able to control
that Google account.

00:48:33.601 --> 00:48:35.234
And because I control
that Google account,

00:48:35.234 --> 00:48:36.601
I can prove that with OpenID,

00:48:36.601 --> 00:48:38.200
you can kind of trust
by transitivity

00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:39.667
that those other sites
are mine as well.

00:48:39.667 --> 00:48:41.467
And then you can follow those
links downstream and so forth

00:48:41.467 --> 00:48:42.767
and you can actually
kind of build

00:48:42.767 --> 00:48:44.234
a whole set
of identifiers about me.

00:48:44.234 --> 00:48:45.767
And we use this in Plaxo.

00:48:45.767 --> 00:48:47.834
I didn't put this in this demo
but maybe I should've.

00:48:47.834 --> 00:48:50.400
Google, again, has come
and made this even easier.

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:52.200
The have this thing
called the Social Graph API

00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:54.400
where they basically said,
gee, crawling the web

00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:55.734
is kind of hard,
but we've already done that

00:48:55.734 --> 00:48:57.334
and we've got it sitting
over here on a hard drive

00:48:57.334 --> 00:48:58.801
as I understand it.

00:48:58.801 --> 00:49:01.234
So why don't we just serve
up all those me links

00:49:01.234 --> 00:49:02.567
in a simple API?

00:49:02.567 --> 00:49:04.267
So if you look for the Google
Social Graph API,

00:49:04.267 --> 00:49:06.567
you can literally put in
any URL and say

00:49:06.567 --> 00:49:08.567
give me all the downstream
rel="me" links.

00:49:08.567 --> 00:49:10.267
And they'll give you all back
in one shot.

00:49:10.267 --> 00:49:11.667
And so we do this when
every time somebody

00:49:11.667 --> 00:49:13.267
either signs up
with an OpenID,

00:49:13.267 --> 00:49:14.968
or say they hook up
their Twitter feed.

00:49:14.968 --> 00:49:16.300
You know, Twitter--
a lot of these sites

00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:17.968
put these rel="me" links
in there for you

00:49:17.968 --> 00:49:20.634
so you don't have to be
a hacker to do it yourself.

00:49:20.634 --> 00:49:22.400
LinkedIn, a bunch
of these sites do that.

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:23.767
We then follow
all those links,

00:49:23.767 --> 00:49:25.734
and those are all ways
we know the user.

00:49:25.734 --> 00:49:27.901
And if they're mapped
to services we know,

00:49:27.901 --> 00:49:29.200
like, we know what
a Flickr URL looks like.

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:30.200
We know what a Twitter URL
looks like.

00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:31.567
We can use it to say, hey,

00:49:31.567 --> 00:49:32.868
looks like you're
a Flickr user too.

00:49:32.868 --> 00:49:33.968
Why don't you hook up
that feed?

00:49:33.968 --> 00:49:35.434
And so you get even more
downstream benefit

00:49:35.434 --> 00:49:37.467
and richer profiles, so--
and that's a really nice way

00:49:37.467 --> 00:49:39.200
of sort of using the
link structure of the web

00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:40.801
to get even richer data
beyond just

00:49:40.801 --> 00:49:42.334
the initial OpenID handshake.

00:49:42.334 --> 00:49:43.501
Yeah.

00:49:43.501 --> 00:49:45.100
man: Hi, thanks for your talk.
Smarr: Sure.

00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:48.701
man: I just had a question
on what you feel browsers

00:49:48.701 --> 00:49:51.367
could do to help enable
all of this.

00:49:51.367 --> 00:49:54.334
As I see OpenID integration
has been a little difficult

00:49:54.334 --> 00:49:56.934
because of the whole UI
being a pain to deal with.

00:49:56.934 --> 00:49:58.067
Smarr: Right.

00:49:58.067 --> 00:49:59.367
man: So what can browsers do
to fix this?

00:49:59.367 --> 00:50:00.834
Are you aware of
any browser projects,

00:50:00.834 --> 00:50:02.400
Firefox, Opera, whoever--

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:03.501
Smarr: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:50:03.501 --> 00:50:05.534
So browsers can be
a huge help in this.

00:50:05.534 --> 00:50:06.934
It's a bit of a chicken
and egg thing

00:50:06.934 --> 00:50:11.834
because on the one hand, if you
think about it, the browser

00:50:11.834 --> 00:50:13.634
is in this wonderful,
privileged position

00:50:13.634 --> 00:50:15.734
where it actually knows
all the different websites

00:50:15.734 --> 00:50:16.734
that you go to, right?

00:50:16.734 --> 00:50:18.434
It's a real pain to say

00:50:18.434 --> 00:50:20.467
tell me which of these
50 websites you use

00:50:20.467 --> 00:50:21.701
so that I can provide you
with a tailored experience,

00:50:21.701 --> 00:50:23.534
whereas the browser actually
knows that.

00:50:23.534 --> 00:50:24.801
And the browser also
presumably

00:50:24.801 --> 00:50:26.834
has privileged information
to your credentials

00:50:26.834 --> 00:50:28.501
on these websites because
it's watched you link--

00:50:28.501 --> 00:50:29.834
sign in to all those.

00:50:29.834 --> 00:50:33.067
And the browser could present--
you know, secure Chrome

00:50:33.067 --> 00:50:34.767
that can't be phished
and you can't redirect

00:50:34.767 --> 00:50:37.067
to a fake site and all
that kind of stuff, right?

00:50:37.067 --> 00:50:39.133
And there have been people
that have done this.

00:50:39.133 --> 00:50:42.601
VeriSign Labs made this plug-in
called OpenID Seatbelt.

00:50:42.601 --> 00:50:44.968
And there's a thing called IDIB,

00:50:44.968 --> 00:50:46.267
Internet Identity
In the Browser,

00:50:46.267 --> 00:50:47.434
that was a project that did
that.

00:50:47.434 --> 00:50:49.801
I think Mozilla also--
they showed a video

00:50:49.801 --> 00:50:51.801
of some sort of OpenID
in the browser type stuff.

00:50:51.801 --> 00:50:53.501
There's a lot
of potential there.

00:50:53.501 --> 00:50:56.367
The downside, of course,
is that getting

00:50:56.367 --> 00:50:58.467
a browser with this upgraded
functionality

00:50:58.467 --> 00:51:00.033
on everybody's desktop
is a real deployment challenge.

00:51:00.033 --> 00:51:03.501
And so I don't think we can wait
for browsers to save us.

00:51:03.501 --> 00:51:05.467
I think there's gonna have
to be a web native solution.

00:51:05.467 --> 00:51:07.634
But I think making it easier
for browsers

00:51:07.634 --> 00:51:09.701
to come in and add
additional value on top of that

00:51:09.701 --> 00:51:11.467
and simplify the UI
and be more personalized

00:51:11.467 --> 00:51:12.767
is an absolute win.

00:51:12.767 --> 00:51:14.400
And I would love to see things
like maybe Google Chrome

00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:15.834
could do that, right?

00:51:15.834 --> 00:51:17.300
That's something that's going
to be distributed

00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:18.834
to lots of people that could add
that kind of functionality.

00:51:18.834 --> 00:51:20.267
So definitely great
opportunities there

00:51:20.267 --> 00:51:21.634
and has been some early work.

00:51:21.634 --> 00:51:23.634
But it's mainly that deployment
challenge is tricky.

00:51:23.634 --> 00:51:25.734
Yeah.

00:51:25.734 --> 00:51:29.801
man: You mentioned earlier
for Facebook friends

00:51:29.801 --> 00:51:31.267
you had a background process

00:51:31.267 --> 00:51:33.801
that kept the graph
up to sync and everything.

00:51:33.801 --> 00:51:37.133
I was wondering if you do that
for any other graph,

00:51:37.133 --> 00:51:38.934
like MySpace or whatever,
and if you've run

00:51:38.934 --> 00:51:41.000
into scalability problems
with that.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.934
Smarr: Yeah, so scalability
of refriending.

00:51:42.934 --> 00:51:45.467
So our core business
traditionally

00:51:45.467 --> 00:51:47.767
is actually real sync.

00:51:47.767 --> 00:51:50.100
So we have an Outlook plug-in
and a Mac plug-in

00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:51.667
and a Thunderbird plug-in
and on and on.

00:51:51.667 --> 00:51:52.767
And that does real,
continuous background

00:51:52.767 --> 00:51:54.334
full contact and calendar
synchronization.

00:51:54.334 --> 00:51:55.634
So we sort of already have

00:51:55.634 --> 00:51:56.801
pretty good infrastructure
for that.

00:51:56.801 --> 00:52:00.200
And the reason
we and almost all sites

00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:02.200
just do a one-time import--
which as I mentioned

00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:04.334
is sort of silly 'cause you miss
all the downstream stuff--

00:52:04.334 --> 00:52:06.334
is because when
you're taking passwords,

00:52:06.334 --> 00:52:07.534
it's not only kind
of a liability

00:52:07.534 --> 00:52:08.968
to take the password,

00:52:08.968 --> 00:52:10.234
it's a real liability
to store the password, right?

00:52:10.234 --> 00:52:12.000
Because if that goes wrong
or if you get hacked,

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.267
you're compromising
all the other sites.

00:52:13.267 --> 00:52:15.167
And so most sites just throw
away the password

00:52:15.167 --> 00:52:16.567
and only do a one-time import.

00:52:16.567 --> 00:52:18.267
But once you get
a long-live token,

00:52:18.267 --> 00:52:20.100
whether it's a Facebook token
or an OAuth token,

00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:22.167
you know have
the luxury of doing

00:52:22.167 --> 00:52:23.734
that kind of repeated
background import

00:52:23.734 --> 00:52:24.901
and pulling in
the information.

00:52:24.901 --> 00:52:26.634
So you could actually get
a lot more value

00:52:26.634 --> 00:52:28.000
than when you just did
the one-time thing

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.501
because you don't have
the security problem.

00:52:29.501 --> 00:52:31.734
So we haven't done as much
as we should, to be honest.

00:52:31.734 --> 00:52:33.701
Like, we don't do it right now

00:52:33.701 --> 00:52:34.734
with when you do
that Google hybrid flow,

00:52:34.734 --> 00:52:36.133
we just pull them in once.

00:52:36.133 --> 00:52:37.801
We don't look in the background,
but we clearly should.

00:52:37.801 --> 00:52:38.934
Like, we're being stupid
not to do that.

00:52:38.934 --> 00:52:40.167
And any site should.

00:52:40.167 --> 00:52:41.567
And it's not really
a scalability problem

00:52:41.567 --> 00:52:43.567
because you can choose
how often you want to do that.

00:52:43.567 --> 00:52:46.067
You could do it once a week
or once a day or whatever.

00:52:46.067 --> 00:52:49.634
And in fact we haven't done this
so much with these sites,

00:52:49.634 --> 00:52:52.567
but in places like in OpenSocial
where you have potentially

00:52:52.567 --> 00:52:54.501
a large number
of user accounts

00:52:54.501 --> 00:52:56.267
that need to be updated
with a service,

00:52:56.267 --> 00:52:58.200
there's ways of sort
of batching that.

00:52:58.200 --> 00:52:59.634
So there's the so-called
two-legged OAuth

00:52:59.634 --> 00:53:01.567
where a service will talk
to another service

00:53:01.567 --> 00:53:05.234
and say, hey, you can trust me
that I'm Plaxo

00:53:05.234 --> 00:53:07.167
because I can prove
that I'm Plaxo.

00:53:07.167 --> 00:53:08.667
And so for these ten users
in batch,

00:53:08.667 --> 00:53:09.934
could you give me updated
information?

00:53:09.934 --> 00:53:11.100
And then they'll just hand them
all over at once

00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:12.701
rather than doing it
one user at a time.

00:53:12.701 --> 00:53:14.501
So there are tricks like that
for scalability

00:53:14.501 --> 00:53:15.934
above and beyond.

00:53:15.934 --> 00:53:17.334
But it's really not that bad
because it's just

00:53:17.334 --> 00:53:18.934
a periodic thing
in the background.

00:53:18.934 --> 00:53:21.434
And maybe someday services
like Gnip will help me

00:53:21.434 --> 00:53:23.834
get pushes about my friend
notifications as well as feeds.

00:53:23.834 --> 00:53:25.934
I mean, really it's kind of
the same problem.

00:53:25.934 --> 00:53:28.033
Yeah.

00:53:28.033 --> 00:53:33.667
man: A question in regards
to OpenID and OAuth usage

00:53:33.667 --> 00:53:37.267
within enterprises as opposed
to outside of enterprises.

00:53:37.267 --> 00:53:39.000
And the second part
of the question,

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:43.667
integration of those with
like Sun's old app

00:53:43.667 --> 00:53:44.901
or Microsoft ID.

00:53:44.901 --> 00:53:46.234
Smarr: Right.
Great question.

00:53:46.234 --> 00:53:47.767
So what about inside
the enterprise?

00:53:47.767 --> 00:53:49.267
Actually, it's funny.

00:53:49.267 --> 00:53:52.300
They had a whole panel on this
at South by Southwest this year.

00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:55.968
And enterprises obviously face
a lot of these same challenges

00:53:55.968 --> 00:53:57.667
and there's a lot of
opportunities there.

00:53:57.667 --> 00:53:59.200
And traditionally they have
been all of these

00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:00.734
kind of one-off hacky systems.

00:54:00.734 --> 00:54:02.734
So I think there's a lot
of optimism now

00:54:02.734 --> 00:54:04.200
that a lot of these technologies
can be applied

00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:05.734
inside the enterprise as well.

00:54:05.734 --> 00:54:07.501
And if you don't know
about this,

00:54:07.501 --> 00:54:08.968
there's this thing called
the Internet Identity Workshop

00:54:08.968 --> 00:54:11.167
which is a kind of unconference
where a bunch of people

00:54:11.167 --> 00:54:13.167
in this field get together
and work on these problems

00:54:13.167 --> 00:54:14.434
and it's a fantastic thing.

00:54:14.434 --> 00:54:17.033
We just had one earlier
this month

00:54:17.033 --> 00:54:18.501
and there was
a whole big session.

00:54:18.501 --> 00:54:20.367
You had guys from Microsoft

00:54:20.367 --> 00:54:22.901
who know all the WS federation
and trust stuff,

00:54:22.901 --> 00:54:25.534
and you had people from Google
and you had other people

00:54:25.534 --> 00:54:26.834
and they're all getting together
and kind of figuring out

00:54:26.834 --> 00:54:29.367
what is different about
the enterprise use cases

00:54:29.367 --> 00:54:30.734
and how does that work
with this stuff.

00:54:30.734 --> 00:54:32.100
A lot of very interesting
progress being made.

00:54:32.100 --> 00:54:34.300
There's already
some early examples.

00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:37.033
There's a cool example
where sun.com,

00:54:37.033 --> 00:54:40.300
they gave all their employees
sun.com OpenIDs

00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:41.300
and the only way
you could get one

00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:42.567
is to be a Sun employee.

00:54:42.567 --> 00:54:44.367
So you could imagine
if Amazon wants

00:54:44.367 --> 00:54:45.601
to give them
an employee discount,

00:54:45.601 --> 00:54:46.934
you just log in with
your Sun account

00:54:46.934 --> 00:54:48.400
and all of a sudden
it verifies it, right?

00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:50.400
So there's all kinds
of interesting models like that.

00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:51.901
I think it's still a little bit
early there.

00:54:51.901 --> 00:54:55.534
And there's a few extra levels
of paranoia

00:54:55.534 --> 00:54:56.968
that maybe need
to be layered on top

00:54:56.968 --> 00:54:57.968
as extensions
or something depending

00:54:57.968 --> 00:55:00.267
on how big the enterprise is

00:55:00.267 --> 00:55:02.467
and how much they want to revoke
and change things or whatever.

00:55:02.467 --> 00:55:06.100
But it also makes a ton
of sense to build--

00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:08.667
I hope somebody would go build
OpenID plug-in

00:55:08.667 --> 00:55:10.567
for something like
Active Directory

00:55:10.567 --> 00:55:12.501
'cause that's the point is--
companies have

00:55:12.501 --> 00:55:14.567
the credentials already
of their employees.

00:55:14.567 --> 00:55:15.801
You'd like to be able
to expose that in a way

00:55:15.801 --> 00:55:17.834
that doesn't require
all these consumer--

00:55:17.834 --> 00:55:20.801
like Yamir, poor Yamir wants
to build this great

00:55:20.801 --> 00:55:22.567
kind of like Twitter-like
application for enterprises.

00:55:22.567 --> 00:55:24.133
But they have to go do
these one-off,

00:55:24.133 --> 00:55:25.501
like, let me poke a hole
in the firewall

00:55:25.501 --> 00:55:27.634
and connect your LDAP
and you dump out and send me--

00:55:27.634 --> 00:55:30.100
It's horrible
and it's not core to them.

00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:31.634
So if you could just say,
well, you could log in

00:55:31.634 --> 00:55:33.868
with your OpenID, then it
might make it a lot easier.

00:55:33.868 --> 00:55:37.934
man: It just so happens
at PGP we built a system

00:55:37.934 --> 00:55:40.567
using--an OpenID system
using a PGP key.

00:55:40.567 --> 00:55:41.767
Smarr: Oh, yeah,
exactly, yeah.

00:55:41.767 --> 00:55:43.334
man: Because we have
this large database

00:55:43.334 --> 00:55:45.400
on the global directory.

00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:46.934
And people got keys in their
machines and there's code.

00:55:46.934 --> 00:55:48.901
Smarr: Yeah.
man: It works very well.

00:55:48.901 --> 00:55:50.267
Smarr: That's fantastic, yeah.
So I really hope that--

00:55:50.267 --> 00:55:52.167
man: So my question is--

00:55:52.167 --> 00:55:54.300
Smarr: You've earned a question.

00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:57.033
man: I understand that Google
wants to provide

00:55:57.033 --> 00:55:59.667
the authentication,
but what if I want

00:55:59.667 --> 00:56:01.767
to use that
to log in to Google?

00:56:01.767 --> 00:56:03.968
You think they're willing
to open up

00:56:03.968 --> 00:56:05.734
to using
another OpenID provider?

00:56:05.734 --> 00:56:08.267
You think
it's gonna level off?

00:56:08.267 --> 00:56:10.133
Smarr: Will the big guys
be relying parties too?

00:56:10.133 --> 00:56:12.467
Well, as Google would say,

00:56:12.467 --> 00:56:14.734
they actually already are
a relying party

00:56:14.734 --> 00:56:16.400
to thousands
of other websites because

00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:18.234
of their Google apps
for your domain project.

00:56:18.234 --> 00:56:19.968
So if you're a company
that wants to host

00:56:19.968 --> 00:56:21.234
Google apps for your domain,

00:56:21.234 --> 00:56:22.734
you can use your own
log-in system

00:56:22.734 --> 00:56:24.501
and get a hosted version
of Gmail.

00:56:24.501 --> 00:56:26.801
Now it's generally not OpenID
on the back end.

00:56:26.801 --> 00:56:28.067
It's things like SAML.

00:56:28.067 --> 00:56:29.601
But it's conceptually
the same thing.

00:56:29.601 --> 00:56:32.334
And obviously I can't speak
for any of the big companies,

00:56:32.334 --> 00:56:34.367
but I think that they all have
the same problem.

00:56:34.367 --> 00:56:36.000
So I mean, the first--
the best example so far

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.667
is Facebook becoming
an OpenID relying party.

00:56:38.667 --> 00:56:40.400
And if you watch
the interview that we did

00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:42.100
on The Social Web TV
with Luke Shepherd

00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:43.834
who was the main engineer
at Facebook who built that,

00:56:43.834 --> 00:56:45.701
what he says is
just because we're big

00:56:45.701 --> 00:56:47.200
doesn't mean we don't care
about growth.

00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:48.634
In fact, quite the opposite.

00:56:48.634 --> 00:56:51.567
And so they have all the same
pain with sign-up friction,

00:56:51.567 --> 00:56:53.234
and getting contacts,
and getting information,

00:56:53.234 --> 00:56:54.834
and having lost passwords.

00:56:54.834 --> 00:56:57.701
And so they're actually very
motivated to make that work.

00:56:57.701 --> 00:56:59.801
I think the things
that are most holding it up

00:56:59.801 --> 00:57:01.234
are actually more downstream.

00:57:01.234 --> 00:57:03.934
So for example, if you want
to go download a desktop client

00:57:03.934 --> 00:57:06.400
or use it on your BlackBerry
or your mobile phone,

00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:07.701
what do you do then?

00:57:07.701 --> 00:57:08.868
And there's good answers
that are being worked out.

00:57:08.868 --> 00:57:11.000
But it's not quite
to the point now

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.000
where they feel like
for their user base

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.801
and their existing deployed apps
and all that,

00:57:14.801 --> 00:57:16.367
they can just switch over.

00:57:16.367 --> 00:57:17.734
But I do believe
it's coming because

00:57:17.734 --> 00:57:19.667
it really will
just drive business value

00:57:19.667 --> 00:57:21.133
and you'd be stupid not
to do it.

00:57:21.133 --> 00:57:22.467
It's just a matter
of who's going to move first.

00:57:22.467 --> 00:57:23.734
man: So what do you think
it's going to take

00:57:23.734 --> 00:57:25.534
to leverage, like, the banks,
the credit cards,

00:57:25.534 --> 00:57:28.734
the bill paying sites
to start doing this?

00:57:28.734 --> 00:57:30.133
Smarr: How do you go
to higher value transactions?

00:57:30.133 --> 00:57:31.968
Well, that is something that

00:57:31.968 --> 00:57:33.234
a lot of these people
think about.

00:57:33.234 --> 00:57:36.734
And again, this--a lot of this
is making the site

00:57:36.734 --> 00:57:38.000
more user-friendly,

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:39.801
and at the same time,
it's actually making it

00:57:39.801 --> 00:57:41.934
more secure because you're
not giving away your password

00:57:41.934 --> 00:57:44.167
and there's a lot more kind of
cryptography under the hood

00:57:44.167 --> 00:57:45.567
baked into these OpenID
and OAuth.

00:57:45.567 --> 00:57:49.267
And so to me, it's sort of
this rare scenario where

00:57:49.267 --> 00:57:52.000
we're actually making the stuff
more user-friendly

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:53.501
and more secure
at the same time.

00:57:53.501 --> 00:57:55.234
And I think the higher value
transaction,

00:57:55.234 --> 00:57:56.667
people like banks and stuff,

00:57:56.667 --> 00:57:58.300
they'll probably take a bit
of a wait-and-see attitude

00:57:58.300 --> 00:57:59.868
and see how this plays out
in the lower value space

00:57:59.868 --> 00:58:01.234
and then kind of scale it up.

00:58:01.234 --> 00:58:02.701
But there's already work being
done with extensions

00:58:02.701 --> 00:58:04.400
about being able to prove
that you used

00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:06.300
a higher level, kind of
two factor authentication

00:58:06.300 --> 00:58:08.467
or things like that
that--so I think we'll see it.

00:58:08.467 --> 00:58:10.434
I mean, again, nobody wants
this friction, right?

00:58:10.434 --> 00:58:11.701
If I go check out
on an ecommerce site,

00:58:11.701 --> 00:58:13.234
I don't want to have
to put in my credit card

00:58:13.234 --> 00:58:14.968
over and over and over again
if I can pull it in securely.

00:58:14.968 --> 00:58:16.267
So I think I'll see that.

00:58:16.267 --> 00:58:18.000
And with three seconds left,
thank you very much

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.400
and go be open and connected.

00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:22.334
