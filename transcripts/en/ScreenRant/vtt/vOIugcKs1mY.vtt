00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:08.040
With some of the biggest stars and most famous
characters in the world, Marvel movies are

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.040
awesome.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.349
The stories are fun, the action is remarkable
and the dialogue between the characters is

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:13.730
surprisingly funny.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.690
With tons of movies coming out each year,
it can be easy to miss an important moment

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:25.410
or two, but that’s what we’re here for!

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.590
For this video we are taking a look at 10
Moments In Marvel Superhero Movies That Mean

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.720
More Than You Think.

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:45.530
Spider-Man Line - Ant-Man
Fans are eagerly awaiting the release of Spiderman

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.429
Homecoming in 2017, but there was a time (not
too long ago) when bringing Spidey to the

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:52.360
MCU was just a dream.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.699
When news broke that Spider-Man would be joining
the MCU, it didn’t take long for Marvel

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.629
to reference him in one of their movies.

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.229
While we didn't see the webslinger in 2015’s
Ant-Man, he was definitely mentioned.

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.380
Near the end of the film, Anthony Mackie’s
Falcon mentions that he's looking for "a guy

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.549
with mad skills."

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.270
He is then told that there is, “A guy who
jumps, a guy who swings, a guy who crawls."

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.200
This, of course, was a pretty clear allusion
to Spiderman, even if they didn’t outright

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.280
say his name.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.450
It was a quick moment that carried more weight
than fans may have thought as it officially

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.860
confirmed that Spidey was on his way!

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.760
Blind Al - Deadpool
2016’s Deadpool definitely took the entire

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.909
world by storm, but with all the hype, one
surprisingly important character may have

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.750
slipped through the cracks.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:46.060
Just like in the comic books, Ryan Reynolds’
Deadpool rooms with a woman named Blind Al.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.719
Al is a minor character in the film, only
appearing in a small number of humorous scenes,

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:53.710
but in the comics, Al is a much more important
character.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.530
Not only did Wade Wilson spare her life, when
he was hired to kill her in his mercenary

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.420
days, but she then also acts as his guide,
trying to keep him on a heroic path.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.549
On top of all that, she also serves to connect
Deadpool with the rest of the Marvel universe,

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.070
as she was actually an old girlfriend of Captain
America during his WWII days!

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.282
Although Blind Al is mostly a comedic device
in the film, her back-story is no laughing

00:02:13.282 --> 00:02:14.282
matter.

00:02:14.282 --> 00:02:16.250
Captain America’s Shield – Iron Man, Iron
Man 2

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.310
Captain America’s Vibranium shield is one
of the most iconic and recognizable items

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.430
in the entire Marvel universe.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.430
The shield has made regular appearances in
the MCU ever since we first got to meet the

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.849
super soldier in Captain America: The First
Avenger – but fans with a keen eye were

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.680
able to spot a prototype version of it twice
before that.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.680
This was of course important because it was
foreshadowing the coming of the Cap to the

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.680
budding franchise.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.340
In Iron Man, the prototype could be seen lying
around in Tony Stark’s workshop and, later,

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.450
in Iron Man 2, it was seen again, when it
was picked up by Phil Coulson and subsequently

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.790
used by Stark to prop up his homemade particle
accelerator.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.099
Both of these moments can easily be missed,
but for true fans that were able to catch

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.659
them, they were an exciting tease at to what
was coming next.

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:53.400
Gauntlet Reveal - Thor
While Thor’s movies may not be regarded

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.080
as the best Marvel films out there, they definitely
serve a purpose and have had some pretty important

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.549
moments hidden in them as well.

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.400
There's a scene in the original Thor film
where they are walking through Odin's mighty

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.129
hall and as they pass different artifacts
on display, the Infinity Gauntlet can be seen

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:09.129
in the distance.

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:14.090
This is of course the giant gold glove that
Thanos wears in order to wield the power of

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.019
all six infinity stones.

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.220
It would make sense for Odin to have the gauntlet
for safekeeping.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.030
It was, of course, revealed in the Age of
Ultron mid-credits scene that Thanos now has

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.170
the gauntlet and is going after the stones,
but the question of how he got it is still

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.170
a mystery.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.910
With the presence of the gauntlet in Thor,
we have to think that Loki helped Thanos is

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.740
some way or another.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.540
Ten Rings – Ant Man
Back in the first Iron Man, Tony was attacked

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.090
and captured by a terrorist organization known
as the Ten Rings and fans of the comics knew

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.310
that meant that The Mandarin was coming.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.364
Fast forward through all the nonsense of Iron
Man 3 and the confusing explanation of the

00:03:50.364 --> 00:03:52.050
Marvel one shot All Hail The King and fans
had to think that they weren’t going to

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.530
hear more about The Mandarin and Ten Rings.

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.510
Then, Ant Man came along and dropped a sneaky
bomb on all of us.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.770
Towards the end of the film, there was a bodyguard
waiting for Darren Cross on a helipad.

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.480
If you looked closely at the man, you saw
that he had a neck tattoo protruding from

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.099
his collar and if you looked even closer,
you could see that that the tattoo was the

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:11.780
insignia of the Ten Rings.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.160
Marvel doesn’t do anything by accident and
we have to think that this means that Ten

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.380
Rings and maybe even The Mandarin is set to
return!

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.810
New Captain America – Captain America Civil
War

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.980
In the comics, Steve Rogers isn't Captain
America forever and it is actually his pal,

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.820
Bucky Barnes who takes up the role after Rogers
is gone.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.340
There have been many shots of Bucky Barnes
wielding the shield, which has caused fans

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.550
to speculate that he will become Captain America
soon or later.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.700
Many fans thought that Captain America: Civil
War could end with Rogers giving up the mantle

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.470
to Barnes, but we now know that to be false.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.830
That being said, Chris Evans only has a couple
more movies left on his Marvel contract, whereas

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.790
Sebastian Stan is signed on for eight more
film.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.740
This fact, along with the teasing shots of
Barnes with the famous shield, and we have

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:55.740
to think that there will be a new Captain
America coming soon enough.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.320
Adam Warlock Cocoon - Thor: The Dark World/Guardians
of the Galaxy

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.160
The post-credits scene at the end of Thor:
The Dark World was really weird.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.630
While it was meant to set up Guardians of
the Galaxy and the Infinity Gauntlet, it was

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.350
tonally very out of place and downright bizarre,
as moviegoers are introduced to the Collector

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.300
and his vast collection of intergalactic oddities.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.900
One of the things hidden in this scene appears
to be Adam Warlock, the "perfect" human who,

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.410
in the comics, eventually made his way to
space and became a very powerful comic being.

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.270
He plays a large role in Marvel's Infinity
Gauntlet comic storyline and he actually also

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.830
showed up in Guardians Of The Galaxy in his
cocoon form.

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.169
As of right now, we don’t know what all
this means, but we know that it is definitely

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:34.169
important as it has shown up twice.

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:38.800
Spiderman Webbed Wings
When it was revealed that Iron Man would be

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.040
working with Spiderman in his solo movie,
fans began to theorize about what possible

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.139
Stark industry tech the webslinger might be
getting his hands on.

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:49.720
When the trailer for Spiderman Homecoming
dropped, there was one moment that answered

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.419
a lot of peoples questions.

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:56.180
The trailer showed Spiderman with some webbed
wings, and fans of the comics instantly recognized

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.229
them as a big part of Spidey’s history.

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:02.340
While the wings had first been mostly decorative,
they have become more and more functional

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.490
over the years giving Spidey the ability to
glide through the air with ease.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:11.040
Tom Holland’s Spider-Man will face off against
Vulture (played by Michael Keaton) in Homecoming,

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.800
so it seems fitting that the Stark-designed
suit will give Spider-Man a little extra help

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.000
against his flying nemesis.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.849
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s map – Iron Man 2
The MCU is famous for dropping hints and teases

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:26.900
for stuff years in advance and it all started
with the Iron Man franchise.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.720
There are lots of important moments like this
in the films but perhaps no instance provided

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.430
more information as to Marvel’s plans than
this scene from Iron Man 2.

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:39.990
As Tony Stark meets Nick Fury at the end of
the film, a map can be seen in the background

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:41.819
with red hotspots highlighted.

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:45.949
From their positions, you can see that they
seem to indicate the locations of superheroes,

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:49.920
including one in Africa, which we now know
was pointing to Wakanda, the land of Black

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.970
Panther, and one in the middle of the Atlantic
Ocean.

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:57.379
The second one has yet to be confirmed, but
many fans have speculated that this is a tease

00:06:57.379 --> 00:07:01.039
for Atlantis and Namor The Submariner.

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:06.130
Nebula - Guardians of the Galaxy
Fans collectively lost their minds when Guardians

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:10.120
Of The Galaxy premiered and turned out to
be one of Marvel’s best movies to date.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:14.150
While the core crew of Guardians got most
of the attention, fans should know that there

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.830
was another character in the film that will
be more important than they think in the coming

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:18.830
films.

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:23.770
Audiences could easily have forgot Karen Gillan’s
Nebula, but that would be extremely foolish.

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:28.550
Not only will she switch sides to join the
titular team in the 2017 Guardians sequel,

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:32.460
but she could also be a key character in the
Infinity War movie saga.

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:36.800
In the comic books, she plays a major role
in defeating Thanos, so that could very well

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.500
happen in the movies as well.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.720
So, for all those casual fans who thought
she was just a one-off character, think again.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:47.610
So there you have it, there is our list of
10 marvel superhero movie moments that totally

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:49.490
mean more than you think.

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:54.480
Which one of these moments caught you off
guard?

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:58.720
What other Marvel moments do you think fans
should re-watch?
