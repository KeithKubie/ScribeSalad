now and it it was a 14 square block area

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000
now and it it was a 14 square block area
 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.910
now and it it was a 14 square block area
that was slated for urban renewal and

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:18.920
that was slated for urban renewal and
 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.200
that was slated for urban renewal and

families were displaced from this area
 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.090
families were displaced from this area
this was what it looked like this is

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100
this was what it looked like this is
 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.280
this was what it looked like this is
actually from the promotional literature

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.290
actually from the promotional literature
 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.950
actually from the promotional literature
that was the plan for the urban renewal

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960
that was the plan for the urban renewal
 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.690
that was the plan for the urban renewal
so you can see that they were

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700
so you can see that they were
 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.160
so you can see that they were

two blocks away but we'll get rid of

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:43.730
two blocks away but we'll get rid of
 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:44.950
two blocks away but we'll get rid of
these and we're gonna build something

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960
these and we're gonna build something
 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.340
these and we're gonna build something
much better but what actually happened

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:48.350
much better but what actually happened
 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:52.420
much better but what actually happened
was nothing got that and so that's a

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430
was nothing got that and so that's a
 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.880
was nothing got that and so that's a
part of this history many of the people

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:54.890
part of this history many of the people
 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.340
part of this history many of the people
who were displaced were families of

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:57.350
who were displaced were families of
 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.590
who were displaced were families of
color most of them low-income and what

00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600
color most of them low-income and what
 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.450
color most of them low-income and what
was promised and what was planned was

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460
was promised and what was planned was
 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.190
was promised and what was planned was
for it to be a moderate and low income

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.200
for it to be a moderate and low income
 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.800
for it to be a moderate and low income
the context is that 40 more than 40

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810
the context is that 40 more than 40
 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.260
the context is that 40 more than 40
years later very little new has actually

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270
years later very little new has actually
 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.630
years later very little new has actually
been built on this site so there are

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:14.640
been built on this site so there are
 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.640
been built on this site so there are
have been a few buildings that have been

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650
have been a few buildings that have been
 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.630
have been a few buildings that have been
built since the that and the demolition

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:20.640
built since the that and the demolition
 

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.410
built since the that and the demolition
actually took close to 15 years so

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:24.420
actually took close to 15 years so
 

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:25.990
actually took close to 15 years so
people lived with the kind of

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000
people lived with the kind of
 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.040
people lived with the kind of
displacement and then the scar of

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050
displacement and then the scar of
 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.530
displacement and then the scar of
watching their neighborhood deteriorate

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:30.540
watching their neighborhood deteriorate
 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:34.010
watching their neighborhood deteriorate
over 15 years so that's the context for

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020
over 15 years so that's the context for
 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.340
over 15 years so that's the context for
this site and then of course you guys so

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:37.350
this site and then of course you guys so
 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:38.840
this site and then of course you guys so
this is sort of what it looks like if

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:38.850
this is sort of what it looks like if
 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:40.100
this is sort of what it looks like if
you're looking at it sort of

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:40.110
you're looking at it sort of
 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.690
you're looking at it sort of
romantically through the chain-link

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:41.700
romantically through the chain-link
 

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.060
romantically through the chain-link
fence with the morning glories but you

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.070
fence with the morning glories but you
 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:47.510
fence with the morning glories but you
can see that parking lots and the very

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520
can see that parking lots and the very
 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.350
can see that parking lots and the very
few buildings that were actually built

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:50.360
few buildings that were actually built
 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.410
few buildings that were actually built
so this is a very different site site of

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:54.420
so this is a very different site site of
 

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:59.960
so this is a very different site site of
the triangle fire mate we can think

00:06:59.960 --> 00:06:59.970
the triangle fire mate we can think
 

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:05.240
the triangle fire mate we can think
about this site as another important

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:05.250
about this site as another important
 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.860
about this site as another important
where another kind of very important and

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:06.870
where another kind of very important and
 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:08.840
where another kind of very important and

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.000
history happened so 1911 we're talking
about now and we're talking about the

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.010
about now and we're talking about the
 

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:17.200
about now and we're talking about the
context of labor history labor activism

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:17.210
context of labor history labor activism
 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:19.610
context of labor history labor activism
the kind of organizing that was

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:19.620
the kind of organizing that was
 

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.800
the kind of organizing that was
happening around the time of the of the

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:21.810
happening around the time of the of the
 

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.260
happening around the time of the of the
fire the kind of labor conditions that

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:24.270
fire the kind of labor conditions that
 

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:29.060
fire the kind of labor conditions that
were in existence at the time so a very

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:29.070
were in existence at the time so a very
 

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:31.190
were in existence at the time so a very
very different kind of context but a

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:31.200
very different kind of context but a
 

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:35.390
very different kind of context but a
very similarly interconnected kind of

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:35.400
very similarly interconnected kind of
 

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.280
very similarly interconnected kind of

questions if spur is connected to larger
 

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.770
questions if spur is connected to larger
histories of race in this country of

histories of race in this country of
 

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.490

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:45.500
larger questions of Housing and inequity
 

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.200
larger questions of Housing and inequity
the triangle fire is really connected to

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:48.210
the triangle fire is really connected to
 

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:50.410
the triangle fire is really connected to
much larger questions about

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:50.420
much larger questions about
 

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:52.990
much larger questions about

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:53.000
labor rights women's rights immigrants
 

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.090

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:55.100
rights right so that we can sort of see
 

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.850

these two sites on these two projects as

these two sites on these two projects as
 

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:03.720
these two sites on these two projects as
being very very specific but also very

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:03.730
being very very specific but also very
 

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:07.600

York history but also with very complex
 

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.210
York history but also with very complex
histories that have very many larger

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:13.220
histories that have very many larger
 

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:14.560

issues that are embedded within the
 

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:17.290
issues that are embedded within the
specifics of their histories and that's

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:17.300
specifics of their histories and that's
 

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:18.430
specifics of their histories and that's
kind of why I wanted to talk about the

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:18.440
kind of why I wanted to talk about the
 

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.700
kind of why I wanted to talk about the
two of them together today and why the

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:21.710
two of them together today and why the
 

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.640
two of them together today and why the
projects that I want to present really

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:24.650
projects that I want to present really
 

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:27.700
projects that I want to present really
focus on looking at these narratives as

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:27.710
focus on looking at these narratives as
 

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:32.140
focus on looking at these narratives as
a way of telling through making space

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:32.150
a way of telling through making space
 

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:35.080
a way of telling through making space
for dialogue to talk through the

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:35.090
for dialogue to talk through the
 

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:37.090
for dialogue to talk through the
complexity of these of these past

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:37.100
complexity of these of these past
 

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:40.330
complexity of these of these past
histories and one of the things that I'm

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:40.340
histories and one of the things that I'm
 

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.670
histories and one of the things that I'm
really always extremely Comus in that is

00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:42.680
really always extremely Comus in that is
 

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.680
really always extremely Comus in that is
the idea that many many diverse

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:44.690
the idea that many many diverse
 

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:46.300
the idea that many many diverse
communities are affected by both of

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:46.310
communities are affected by both of
 

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:47.860
communities are affected by both of
these sites of both of these histories

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:47.870
these sites of both of these histories
 

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:51.490
these sites of both of these histories
and most often these are very divergent

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:51.500
and most often these are very divergent
 

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.820
and most often these are very divergent
communities who are impacted by these

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:54.830
communities who are impacted by these
 

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:57.310
communities who are impacted by these
two sites and these two histories with

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:57.320
two sites and these two histories with
 

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.900
two sites and these two histories with
very divergent interests and very

00:08:58.900 --> 00:08:58.910
very divergent interests and very
 

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:02.530
very divergent interests and very
divergent needs and in this kind of

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:02.540
divergent needs and in this kind of
 

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.920
divergent needs and in this kind of
practice in this kind of work that is

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:04.930
practice in this kind of work that is
 

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:08.830
practice in this kind of work that is

what I'm really interested in using to
unpack some of these really complex

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:51.500
unpack some of these really complex
 

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:55.300
unpack some of these really complex
ideas on these complex sites so this

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:55.310
ideas on these complex sites so this
 

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:57.520
ideas on these complex sites so this
parcel of land is not only the site of

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:57.530
parcel of land is not only the site of
 

00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:01.570
parcel of land is not only the site of
this really complex history and would

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:01.580
this really complex history and would
 

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:05.710
this really complex history and would
really explore tragedy of displacement

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:05.720
really explore tragedy of displacement
 

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.700

in the late 50s but it's also located at
this very potent kind of intersection

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:12.830
this very potent kind of intersection
 

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:14.470
this very potent kind of intersection
and parcel of land at the Lower East

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:14.480
and parcel of land at the Lower East
 

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.480
and parcel of land at the Lower East
Side right so it's kind of the

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:16.490
Side right so it's kind of the
 

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:18.330
Side right so it's kind of the
intersection of the historically Jewish

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:18.340

Chinese and Puerto Rican Lower East
Side's and it really has a very

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:24.760
Side's and it really has a very
 

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.280
Side's and it really has a very
important kind of connection for all of

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:27.290
important kind of connection for all of
 

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:29.800
important kind of connection for all of
those communities and so when my

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:29.810
those communities and so when my
 

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:31.660
those communities and so when my
students take their first walkthrough

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:31.670
students take their first walkthrough
 

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:33.430

Saburo they always have this kind of

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:33.440
Saburo they always have this kind of
 

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.550
Saburo they always have this kind of
shock of the wilderness and also of

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:36.560
shock of the wilderness and also of
 

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.830
shock of the wilderness and also of
recognition so it's a very complicated

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:38.840
recognition so it's a very complicated
 

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.530
recognition so it's a very complicated
and hard to understand place visually

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:41.540
and hard to understand place visually
 

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.600
and hard to understand place visually
it's hard to make sense of it but it's

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:43.610
it's hard to make sense of it but it's
 

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:44.890
it's hard to make sense of it but it's
also a place that you've all sort of

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:44.900
also a place that you've all sort of
 

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.450
also a place that you've all sort of
been to before and maybe turned away

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:46.460
been to before and maybe turned away
 

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:50.160
been to before and maybe turned away
from and sort of walked around and so I

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:50.170
from and sort of walked around and so I
 

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:55.480

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:39.970
engage in practices that lead us to make
things that look like this so how do we

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:39.980
things that look like this so how do we
 

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:43.300
things that look like this so how do we
kind of use this history and engage with

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:43.310
kind of use this history and engage with
 

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:45.550
kind of use this history and engage with
this history and why make something that

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:45.560
this history and why make something that
 

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:49.030
this history and why make something that
ends up being an exhibition to ask some

ends up being an exhibition to ask some
 

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.889
ends up being an exhibition to ask some
kinds of complex questions about these

00:13:50.889 --> 00:13:50.899
kinds of complex questions about these
 

00:13:50.899 --> 00:13:53.980
kinds of complex questions about these
important and kind of contradictory

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:53.990

and also how do they engage with a site
it's not their home and so that's

00:14:53.239 --> 00:14:53.249
it's not their home and so that's
 

00:14:53.249 --> 00:14:56.299
it's not their home and so that's
something that through this process has

00:14:56.299 --> 00:14:56.309
something that through this process has
 

00:14:56.309 --> 00:14:58.189
something that through this process has
been really important to think about

00:14:58.189 --> 00:14:58.199
been really important to think about
 

00:14:58.199 --> 00:15:00.590
been really important to think about
kind of grounding ourselves in sites

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:00.600
kind of grounding ourselves in sites
 

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:05.980
kind of grounding ourselves in sites
histories so using ways of engaging with

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:05.990
histories so using ways of engaging with
 

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:09.189

really deep community participation

00:15:09.189 --> 00:15:09.199
really deep community participation

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.069
understanding through the community so
that's been a really important part this

00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:37.079
that's been a really important part this
 

00:15:37.079 --> 00:15:40.549
that's been a really important part this
idea that through these kinds of long

00:15:40.549 --> 00:15:40.559
idea that through these kinds of long
 

00:15:40.559 --> 00:15:42.350
idea that through these kinds of long
term practices because I've been working

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:42.360
term practices because I've been working
 

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.869
term practices because I've been working
on this project for four years that we

00:15:44.869 --> 00:15:44.879
on this project for four years that we
 

00:15:44.879 --> 00:15:48.920
on this project for four years that we
build trust over that period of time and

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:48.930
build trust over that period of time and
 

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:50.600
build trust over that period of time and
I think we've really also sort of

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:50.610
I think we've really also sort of
 

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:53.360
I think we've really also sort of
developed ideas both sort of within the

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:53.370
developed ideas both sort of within the
 

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:57.019
developed ideas both sort of within the
class and as a practice and also in

00:15:57.019 --> 00:15:57.029
class and as a practice and also in
 

00:15:57.029 --> 00:15:58.879
class and as a practice and also in
collaboration with our community

00:15:58.879 --> 00:15:58.889

partners about what art practices
 

00:16:02.189 --> 00:16:05.299
partners about what art practices
whatever that might mean can do in this

00:16:05.299 --> 00:16:05.309
whatever that might mean can do in this
 

00:16:05.309 --> 00:16:08.179
whatever that might mean can do in this
context of community activism and that's

00:16:08.179 --> 00:16:08.189
context of community activism and that's
 

00:16:08.189 --> 00:16:09.679
context of community activism and that's
I think been a really interesting and

00:16:09.679 --> 00:16:09.689
I think been a really interesting and
 

00:16:09.689 --> 00:16:14.810
I think been a really interesting and
important part of the project so

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:14.820
important part of the project so
 

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:16.700
important part of the project so
we spend a lot of time brainstorming

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:16.710
we spend a lot of time brainstorming
 

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:18.620
we spend a lot of time brainstorming
ways to think about well what impact are

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:18.630
ways to think about well what impact are
 

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:21.350
ways to think about well what impact are
the goals of doing this kind of work you

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360
the goals of doing this kind of work you
 

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.690
the goals of doing this kind of work you
know how do you actually include voices

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:23.700
know how do you actually include voices
 

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.310
know how do you actually include voices
how do you think about the possibilities

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:25.320
how do you think about the possibilities
 

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.680
how do you think about the possibilities
how do you kind of make something that

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:27.690
how do you kind of make something that
 

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:31.850
how do you kind of make something that
is open rather than closed my students

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:31.860
is open rather than closed my students
 

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.110
is open rather than closed my students
go through process these are mostly

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120
go through process these are mostly
 

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.800
go through process these are mostly
students who are not part students over

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:36.810
students who are not part students over
 

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:39.380
students who are not part students over
not design students so they often the

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:39.390
not design students so they often the
 

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:43.930
not design students so they often the
idea of making form from rich kinds of

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:43.940
idea of making form from rich kinds of
 

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:47.120
idea of making form from rich kinds of
in-depth research is very alien to them

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:47.130
in-depth research is very alien to them
 

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:49.700
in-depth research is very alien to them
so the practice of building in what is a

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:49.710
so the practice of building in what is a
 

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:52.160
so the practice of building in what is a
critique and and how do you kind of make

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:52.170
critique and and how do you kind of make
 

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:54.350
critique and and how do you kind of make
things Ruth and I were just talking

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:54.360
things Ruth and I were just talking
 

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.570
things Ruth and I were just talking
earlier with students and one of the

00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:56.580
earlier with students and one of the
 

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:57.980
earlier with students and one of the
things that we were talking about was

00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:57.990
things that we were talking about was
 

00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:59.690
things that we were talking about was
you know how do you get things funded

00:16:59.690 --> 00:16:59.700
you know how do you get things funded
 

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.310
you know how do you get things funded
well one of the things ways I think we

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:01.320
well one of the things ways I think we
 

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.230
well one of the things ways I think we
get things but is is by actually making

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:03.240
get things but is is by actually making
 

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:07.340
get things but is is by actually making
things and showing a project and so this

00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:07.350
things and showing a project and so this
 

00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:09.829
things and showing a project and so this
is also part of this is like this idea

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839
is also part of this is like this idea
 

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:13.220
is also part of this is like this idea
of processes of making so you have lots

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:13.230
of processes of making so you have lots
 

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:15.980
of processes of making so you have lots
of critiques lots of trying things out

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:15.990
of critiques lots of trying things out
 

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:19.579
of critiques lots of trying things out
and lots of ways of just thinking

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:19.589
and lots of ways of just thinking
 

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:22.100
and lots of ways of just thinking
through how do you make visual these

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:22.110
through how do you make visual these
 

00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:25.490
through how do you make visual these
very complex questions about a site that

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:25.500
very complex questions about a site that
 

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:31.370
very complex questions about a site that
is highly contested and and highly

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:31.380
is highly contested and and highly
 

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:35.930
is highly contested and and highly
divided so thinking about making maps so

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:35.940
divided so thinking about making maps so
 

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:40.490
divided so thinking about making maps so
this has led to a series of exhibitions

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:40.500
this has led to a series of exhibitions
 

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:44.360
this has led to a series of exhibitions
so in local areas so in the local area

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:44.370
so in local areas so in the local area
 

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:46.940

and neighborhood community centers so

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:46.950
and neighborhood community centers so
 

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:49.820
and neighborhood community centers so
this one was a common room a small

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:49.830
this one was a common room a small
 

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:51.910
this one was a common room a small
gallery space this one was also there

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:51.920
gallery space this one was also there
 

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:54.500
gallery space this one was also there
and you can see these projects that are

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:54.510
and you can see these projects that are
 

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:57.410
and you can see these projects that are
extraordinarily kind of interactive that

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:57.420
extraordinarily kind of interactive that
 

00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:59.300
extraordinarily kind of interactive that
we try to look at qualities of this

00:17:59.300 --> 00:17:59.310
we try to look at qualities of this
 

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:01.280
we try to look at qualities of this
space so one of the the goals of this

they opened so this portion of the

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:03.330
they opened so this portion of the
 

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:05.300
they opened so this portion of the
project is not just kind of creating

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:05.310
project is not just kind of creating
 

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:08.510
project is not just kind of creating
spaces for dialogue through exhibition

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:08.520
spaces for dialogue through exhibition
 

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:12.100
spaces for dialogue through exhibition
sites but also kind of amongst a one

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:12.110
sites but also kind of amongst a one
 

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:15.050
sites but also kind of amongst a one
specific small group kind of in the

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:15.060
specific small group kind of in the
 

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:18.590
specific small group kind of in the
practice of walking and inserting that

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:18.600
practice of walking and inserting that
 

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:20.210
practice of walking and inserting that
into of space we're in that kind of

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:20.220
into of space we're in that kind of
 

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:21.890
into of space we're in that kind of
physical space where these kinds of

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:21.900
physical space where these kinds of
 

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:23.450
physical space where these kinds of
conversations I've been really sorely

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:23.460
conversations I've been really sorely
 

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:28.340
conversations I've been really sorely
lacking so this is what happened this

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:28.350
lacking so this is what happened this
 

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:30.620
lacking so this is what happened this
year was a culmination of four years of

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:30.630
year was a culmination of four years of
 

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:32.930
year was a culmination of four years of
this practice this is and this was the

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:32.940
this practice this is and this was the
 

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:34.820
this practice this is and this was the
first time that this work was actually

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:34.830
first time that this work was actually
 

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:36.290
first time that this work was actually
shown outside of the community this was

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:36.300
shown outside of the community this was
 

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:39.020
shown outside of the community this was
at the new school and so one of the

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:39.030
at the new school and so one of the
 

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:40.730
at the new school and so one of the
things that was quite interesting to me

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:40.740
things that was quite interesting to me
 

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:42.350
things that was quite interesting to me
was to think about well how can this be

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:42.360
was to think about well how can this be
 

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:45.080
was to think about well how can this be
another sort of space and so you know

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:45.090
another sort of space and so you know
 

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:46.670
another sort of space and so you know
who are the audiences and who are the

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:46.680
who are the audiences and who are the
 

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:48.410
who are the audiences and who are the
communities that are kind of coming to

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:48.420
communities that are kind of coming to
 

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:49.940
communities that are kind of coming to
this space as opposed to these other

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:49.950
this space as opposed to these other
 

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:55.910
this space as opposed to these other
spaces as well looking at it and you

00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:55.920
spaces as well looking at it and you
 

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.290
spaces as well looking at it and you
know one of the things that happen at

00:22:57.290 --> 00:22:57.300
know one of the things that happen at
 

00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:59.870
know one of the things that happen at
the opening was someone asked me what

00:22:59.870 --> 00:22:59.880
the opening was someone asked me what
 

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.350
the opening was someone asked me what
the eventual goal of this project was

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:02.360
the eventual goal of this project was
 

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.820
the eventual goal of this project was
and I realized that really quite simply

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:04.830
and I realized that really quite simply
 

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:06.560
and I realized that really quite simply
and I think my answer sort of surprised

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:06.570
and I think my answer sort of surprised
 

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:08.120
and I think my answer sort of surprised
her I said well actually that it's

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:08.130
her I said well actually that it's
 

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:10.100
her I said well actually that it's
really simply having people together in

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:10.110
really simply having people together in
 

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:12.130
really simply having people together in
this room talking about this question

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:12.140
this room talking about this question
 

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:16.070
this room talking about this question
and that answers to what should happen

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080
and that answers to what should happen
 

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:18.770
and that answers to what should happen
in this kind of contested site really

00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:18.780
in this kind of contested site really
 

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:20.440
in this kind of contested site really
have to come from within the community

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:20.450
have to come from within the community
 

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:23.210
have to come from within the community
but that without a space for having a

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:23.220
but that without a space for having a
 

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:26.300
but that without a space for having a
dialogue around that there's really no

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:26.310
dialogue around that there's really no
 

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:29.300
dialogue around that there's really no
way to get to that point so this is one

00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:29.310
way to get to that point so this is one
 

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:33.269
way to get to that point so this is one
of the comments left at the exhibition

00:23:33.269 --> 00:23:33.279
 
 

00:23:33.279 --> 00:23:35.940
 
and so I just want to kind of shift

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:35.950
and so I just want to kind of shift
 

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:39.060
and so I just want to kind of shift
gears a little and to show you a small

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:39.070
gears a little and to show you a small
 

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:41.430
gears a little and to show you a small
portion of the the triangle fire open

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:41.440
portion of the the triangle fire open
 

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.590
portion of the the triangle fire open
archive an open museum project to kind

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:43.600
archive an open museum project to kind
 

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.570
archive an open museum project to kind
of show a different way of taking this

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:45.580
of show a different way of taking this
 

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:49.440
of show a different way of taking this
approach and so here we are back at the

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:49.450
approach and so here we are back at the
 

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:51.810
approach and so here we are back at the
ash building you know we're jumping back

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:51.820
ash building you know we're jumping back
 

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:55.080
ash building you know we're jumping back
in time to 1911 it feels like a very

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:55.090
in time to 1911 it feels like a very
 

00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:57.960
in time to 1911 it feels like a very
divergent kind of question you know

00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:57.970
divergent kind of question you know
 

00:23:57.970 --> 00:23:59.940
divergent kind of question you know
thinking about the history of this fire

00:23:59.940 --> 00:23:59.950
thinking about the history of this fire
 

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:02.039
thinking about the history of this fire
that was so incredibly destructive to

00:24:02.039 --> 00:24:02.049
that was so incredibly destructive to
 

00:24:02.049 --> 00:24:04.230
that was so incredibly destructive to
the people who were inside this building

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:04.240
the people who were inside this building
 

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.680
the people who were inside this building
but actually not to the building itself

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:06.690
but actually not to the building itself
 

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:09.029
but actually not to the building itself
you know and thinking about you know why

00:24:09.029 --> 00:24:09.039
you know and thinking about you know why
 

00:24:09.039 --> 00:24:13.230
you know and thinking about you know why
is it still relevant well 2010 we have a

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:13.240
is it still relevant well 2010 we have a
 

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.639
is it still relevant well 2010 we have a
similar kind of fire happening in

00:24:14.639 --> 00:24:14.649
similar kind of fire happening in
 

00:24:14.649 --> 00:24:17.370
similar kind of fire happening in
Bangladesh we have questions about labor

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:17.380
Bangladesh we have questions about labor
 

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:19.200
Bangladesh we have questions about labor
organizing we have questions about you

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:19.210
organizing we have questions about you
 

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:22.320
organizing we have questions about you
know Scott Walker banning unions all of

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:22.330
know Scott Walker banning unions all of
 

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:23.730
know Scott Walker banning unions all of
this kind of thing that's happening

00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:23.740
this kind of thing that's happening
 

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:26.460
this kind of thing that's happening
right now so how do we sort of think

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:26.470
right now so how do we sort of think
 

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:28.710
right now so how do we sort of think
about the larger questions embedded in

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:28.720
about the larger questions embedded in
 

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:30.740
about the larger questions embedded in
both of these sites as a reason for

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:30.750
both of these sites as a reason for
 

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:33.000
both of these sites as a reason for
investigating them and as a reason for

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:33.010
investigating them and as a reason for
 

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:35.580
investigating them and as a reason for
instigating kinds of dialogue around

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:35.590
instigating kinds of dialogue around
 

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:38.460
instigating kinds of dialogue around
them so you know thinking about well

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:38.470
them so you know thinking about well
 

00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:40.440
them so you know thinking about well
this is the this is what they trying to

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:40.450
this is the this is what they trying to
 

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:42.510
this is the this is what they trying to
fire open our kind of looks like so how

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:42.520
fire open our kind of looks like so how
 

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:43.710
fire open our kind of looks like so how
can a form that looks like this a

00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:43.720
can a form that looks like this a
 

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:46.440
can a form that looks like this a
virtual online space and I'm really

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:46.450
virtual online space and I'm really
 

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:47.610
virtual online space and I'm really
addressed some of those sorts of

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:47.620
addressed some of those sorts of
 

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:50.940
addressed some of those sorts of
questions so the project really takes

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:50.950
questions so the project really takes
 

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:52.440
questions so the project really takes
this very participatory and

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:52.450
this very participatory and
 

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:54.510
this very participatory and
collaborative approach and it's a

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:54.520
collaborative approach and it's a
 

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:56.100
collaborative approach and it's a
collaboration between the remember the

00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:56.110
collaboration between the remember the
 

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:58.320
collaboration between the remember the
triangle fire coalition which Ruth will

00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:58.330
triangle fire coalition which Ruth will
 

00:24:58.330 --> 00:24:59.970
triangle fire coalition which Ruth will
certainly talk about Ruth is the founder

00:24:59.970 --> 00:24:59.980
certainly talk about Ruth is the founder
 

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:03.000
certainly talk about Ruth is the founder
of that coalition and vez cada mine

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:03.010
of that coalition and vez cada mine
 

00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:05.340
of that coalition and vez cada mine
organization and so one of the things

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:05.350
organization and so one of the things
 

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:08.580
organization and so one of the things
that was so phenomenal and as we sort of

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:08.590
that was so phenomenal and as we sort of
 

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:10.200
that was so phenomenal and as we sort of
think about kind of definitions of

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:10.210
think about kind of definitions of
 

00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:12.299
think about kind of definitions of
community was to think about well who

00:25:12.299 --> 00:25:12.309
community was to think about well who
 

00:25:12.309 --> 00:25:14.100
community was to think about well who
was involved in this coalition on how

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:14.110
was involved in this coalition on how
 

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:17.669
was involved in this coalition on how
incredibly broad and amazing those

00:25:17.669 --> 00:25:17.679
incredibly broad and amazing those
 

00:25:17.679 --> 00:25:19.440
incredibly broad and amazing those
conversations were that happened between

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:19.450
conversations were that happened between
 

00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:22.799
conversations were that happened between
these groups of people and so one of the

00:25:22.799 --> 00:25:22.809
these groups of people and so one of the
 

00:25:22.809 --> 00:25:25.019
these groups of people and so one of the
things that we really wanted to do was

00:25:25.019 --> 00:25:25.029
things that we really wanted to do was
 

00:25:25.029 --> 00:25:30.200
things that we really wanted to do was
to take an approach that

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:30.210
 
 

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:33.140
 
is some aspect of the fact that all of

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:33.150
is some aspect of the fact that all of
 

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:34.520
is some aspect of the fact that all of
these people were getting together in a

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:34.530
these people were getting together in a
 

00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:36.620
these people were getting together in a
room or around thinking about this the

00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:36.630
room or around thinking about this the
 

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:40.250
room or around thinking about this the
triangle fire or Centennial and to think

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:40.260
triangle fire or Centennial and to think
 

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:44.990
triangle fire or Centennial and to think
about well can objects tell stories can

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.000
about well can objects tell stories can
 

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.150
about well can objects tell stories can
those objects stand in for these

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:47.160
those objects stand in for these
 

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:48.710
those objects stand in for these
multiple perspectives that works are

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:48.720
multiple perspectives that works are
 

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:51.530
multiple perspectives that works are
being brought into the room and so we

00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:51.540
being brought into the room and so we
 

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:55.100
being brought into the room and so we
created this open archive which is an

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:55.110
created this open archive which is an
 

00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:59.000
created this open archive which is an
online space through that of community

00:25:59.000 --> 00:25:59.010
online space through that of community
 

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:01.550
online space through that of community
contributed objects that we asked people

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:01.560
contributed objects that we asked people
 

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.830
contributed objects that we asked people
to just contribute objects that they

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:03.840
to just contribute objects that they
 

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:06.380
to just contribute objects that they
thought for some reason told some

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:06.390
thought for some reason told some
 

00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:09.140
thought for some reason told some
portion of a triangle fire story or the

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:09.150
portion of a triangle fire story or the
 

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:12.350
portion of a triangle fire story or the
significance of it today and so you know

00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:12.360
significance of it today and so you know
 

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:15.190
significance of it today and so you know
really thinking about this idea that

00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:15.200
really thinking about this idea that
 

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.720
really thinking about this idea that
stories become embodied once they're

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:17.730
stories become embodied once they're
 

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:19.310
stories become embodied once they're
sort of embedded in objects that they

00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:19.320
sort of embedded in objects that they
 

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:21.020
sort of embedded in objects that they
become much more tangible and much more

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:21.030
become much more tangible and much more
 

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:23.810
become much more tangible and much more
understandable when we can kind of use

00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:23.820
understandable when we can kind of use
 

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:25.340
understandable when we can kind of use
the idea of the object as a way to

00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:25.350
the idea of the object as a way to
 

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:29.330
the idea of the object as a way to
explore them and to bring in these

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:29.340
explore them and to bring in these
 

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:31.630
explore them and to bring in these
multiple ways of participation so

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:31.640
multiple ways of participation so
 

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:34.010
multiple ways of participation so
collecting objects in person but also

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:34.020
collecting objects in person but also
 

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:36.830
collecting objects in person but also
online thinking about the different

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840
online thinking about the different
 

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:39.110
online thinking about the different
kinds of objects that can tell stories

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:39.120
kinds of objects that can tell stories
 

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.210
kinds of objects that can tell stories
of personal objects and public objects

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:41.220
of personal objects and public objects
 

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:44.210
of personal objects and public objects
doing research on very little documented

00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:44.220
doing research on very little documented
 

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:46.070
doing research on very little documented
kind of work so very personal objects

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:46.080
kind of work so very personal objects
 

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:51.980
kind of work so very personal objects
like the Rosie Weiner portrait collected

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:51.990
like the Rosie Weiner portrait collected
 

00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:54.410
like the Rosie Weiner portrait collected
from her great niece and so this is a

00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:54.420
from her great niece and so this is a
 

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:57.610
from her great niece and so this is a
photograph of something that sits on her

00:26:57.610 --> 00:26:57.620
photograph of something that sits on her
 

00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:00.530
photograph of something that sits on her
mantelpiece or our bookshelf extra and

00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:00.540
mantelpiece or our bookshelf extra and
 

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:03.770
mantelpiece or our bookshelf extra and
and so that becomes part of this archive

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:03.780
and so that becomes part of this archive
 

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:06.140
and so that becomes part of this archive
and this is what it looks like in the

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:06.150
and this is what it looks like in the
 

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:12.160
and this is what it looks like in the
upper drive itself or objects like a

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:12.170
upper drive itself or objects like a
 

00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:15.230

so how's it having nothing to do so I

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:18.080
so how's it having nothing to do so I
 

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.110
so how's it having nothing to do so I
should say Rosie Wiener was a victim of

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:20.120
should say Rosie Wiener was a victim of
 

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:21.120
should say Rosie Wiener was a victim of
the triangle fire

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:21.130
the triangle fire
 

00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:25.649

you know then we dropped forward to 1982

00:27:25.649 --> 00:27:25.659
you know then we dropped forward to 1982
 

00:27:25.659 --> 00:27:28.720
you know then we dropped forward to 1982
what does that have to do with 1911

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:28.730
what does that have to do with 1911
 

00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:30.399
what does that have to do with 1911
right it has something to do with the

00:27:30.399 --> 00:27:30.409
right it has something to do with the
 

00:27:30.409 --> 00:27:32.590
right it has something to do with the
larger questions that are at stake than

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:32.600
larger questions that are at stake than
 

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:35.649
larger questions that are at stake than
that are at stake now and certainly also

00:27:35.649 --> 00:27:35.659
that are at stake now and certainly also

out so this is sort of gathering these
 

00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:46.510
out so this is sort of gathering these
objects in person photographing them and

objects in person photographing them and
 

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:48.490
objects in person photographing them and
then also have letting them live online

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:48.500
then also have letting them live online
 

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:51.120
then also have letting them live online
and and live online in their sort of

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:51.130

into the tangible world and to think
 

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:15.639
into the tangible world and to think
about how can we insert them back into

00:28:15.639 --> 00:28:15.649
about how can we insert them back into
 

00:28:15.649 --> 00:28:17.470

they're right now all around the city in
 

00:28:33.289 --> 00:28:37.419
they're right now all around the city in

be kind of nice places to go and see
 

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:14.860
be kind of nice places to go and see
things or because they're having to be

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:14.870
things or because they're having to be
 

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:16.480
things or because they're having to be
open to the public but there are also

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:16.490
open to the public but there are also
 

00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:18.400
open to the public but there are also
sites that talk about these larger

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:18.410
sites that talk about these larger
 

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:19.990

America has an image of that right so

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:29.480
America has an image of that right so
 

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:31.660
America has an image of that right so
you can think about the ways in which

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:31.670
you can think about the ways in which
 

00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:35.800
you can think about the ways in which
we're sort of bringing these objects out

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:35.810
we're sort of bringing these objects out
 

00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:37.840
we're sort of bringing these objects out
into the world and one of the things

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:37.850
into the world and one of the things
 

00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:39.220
into the world and one of the things
that we've been really interested in is

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:39.230
that we've been really interested in is
 

00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:40.660
that we've been really interested in is
the ways in which sort of situating

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:40.670
the ways in which sort of situating
 

00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:43.060
the ways in which sort of situating
objects in the world can actually then

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:43.070
objects in the world can actually then
 

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:45.790
objects in the world can actually then
lead to further conversation around to

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:45.800
lead to further conversation around to
 

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:53.740
lead to further conversation around to
using the objects themselves and really

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:53.750
using the objects themselves and really
 

00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:55.000
using the objects themselves and really
one of the things that I just wanted to

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:55.010
one of the things that I just wanted to
 

00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:56.770
one of the things that I just wanted to
kind of highlight is this idea of this

00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:56.780
kind of highlight is this idea of this
 

00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:58.840
kind of highlight is this idea of this
sort of public projects as making space

00:29:58.840 --> 00:29:58.850
sort of public projects as making space
 

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:01.750
sort of public projects as making space
for dialogue right so that and acting as

00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:01.760
for dialogue right so that and acting as
 

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.880
for dialogue right so that and acting as
a kind of bridge so between City sites

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:03.890
a kind of bridge so between City sites
 

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:05.680
a kind of bridge so between City sites
and institutions that are in and of

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:05.690
and institutions that are in and of
 

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:08.050
and institutions that are in and of
themselves really significant but also

00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:08.060
themselves really significant but also
 

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:10.990
themselves really significant but also
between aspects of public memory public

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:11.000
between aspects of public memory public
 

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.930
between aspects of public memory public
practice public history so to use these

00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:13.940
practice public history so to use these
 

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:16.000
practice public history so to use these
both these two projects as a ways of

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:16.010
both these two projects as a ways of
 

00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:17.890
both these two projects as a ways of
making connections between this and and

00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:17.900
making connections between this and and
 

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:20.500
making connections between this and and
in that in that connection that the

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:20.510
in that in that connection that the
 

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:23.620
in that in that connection that the
point of it is to get people to talk

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:23.630
point of it is to get people to talk
 

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:25.990
point of it is to get people to talk
around these sites and to make spaces

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:26.000
around these sites and to make spaces
 

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.930
around these sites and to make spaces
for that kind of talk to happen so

00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:28.940
for that kind of talk to happen so
 

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:30.850
for that kind of talk to happen so
thinking about that these are very

00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:30.860
thinking about that these are very
 

00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:32.710
thinking about that these are very
different kinds of you talk in different

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:32.720
different kinds of you talk in different
 

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:39.310
different kinds of you talk in different
kinds of dialogic practice but I see a

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:39.320
kinds of dialogic practice but I see a
 

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:41.020
kinds of dialogic practice but I see a
lot of connections between them and I

00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:41.030
lot of connections between them and I
 

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:43.570
lot of connections between them and I
think particularly in their basis around

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:43.580
think particularly in their basis around
 

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:48.100
think particularly in their basis around
kind of nuanced richness of personal

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:48.110
kind of nuanced richness of personal
 

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:50.520
kind of nuanced richness of personal
histories as being the basis

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:50.530
histories as being the basis
 

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:52.890
histories as being the basis
these sorts of projects and the fact

00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:52.900
these sorts of projects and the fact
 

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:53.880
these sorts of projects and the fact
that you know there is something that

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:53.890
that you know there is something that
 

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:55.800
that you know there is something that
you can take away from both projects and

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:55.810
you can take away from both projects and
 

00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:59.700
you can take away from both projects and
use those things to explore the city and

00:30:59.700 --> 00:30:59.710
use those things to explore the city and
 

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:01.950
use those things to explore the city and
see the city itself in a different way

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:01.960
see the city itself in a different way
 

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:04.620
see the city itself in a different way
to sort and search yourself in a new way

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:04.630
to sort and search yourself in a new way
 

00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:58.540
to sort and search yourself in a new way
into those dialects as well

00:31:58.540 --> 00:31:58.550
 
 

00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:12.159
 
thirty seconds more will be there

00:32:12.159 --> 00:32:12.169
 
 

00:32:12.169 --> 00:32:15.460
 
hi and thanks especially to the students

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:15.470
hi and thanks especially to the students
 

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:17.979
hi and thanks especially to the students
in boarding who did the pre two hours

00:32:17.979 --> 00:32:17.989
in boarding who did the pre two hours
 

00:32:17.989 --> 00:32:23.379
in boarding who did the pre two hours
doing the long haul run I think what I'm

00:32:23.379 --> 00:32:23.389
doing the long haul run I think what I'm
 

00:32:23.389 --> 00:32:26.710
doing the long haul run I think what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna try to blaze

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.720
gonna do is I'm gonna try to blaze
 

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:29.409
gonna do is I'm gonna try to blaze
through an overview of a lot of work

00:32:29.409 --> 00:32:29.419
through an overview of a lot of work
 

00:32:29.419 --> 00:32:32.680
through an overview of a lot of work
that I've made because mostly what I'd

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:32.690
that I've made because mostly what I'd
 

00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:36.039
that I've made because mostly what I'd
like to talk about is it's sort of

00:32:36.039 --> 00:32:36.049
like to talk about is it's sort of
 

00:32:36.049 --> 00:32:37.930
like to talk about is it's sort of
bigger issues than any specific projects

00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:37.940
bigger issues than any specific projects
 

00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:44.019
bigger issues than any specific projects
and kind of what I'd like to start with

00:32:44.019 --> 00:32:44.029
and kind of what I'd like to start with
 

00:32:44.029 --> 00:32:45.220
and kind of what I'd like to start with
this you know I've sort of reached a

00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:45.230
this you know I've sort of reached a
 

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:46.749
this you know I've sort of reached a
point where my I feel very strongly that

00:32:46.749 --> 00:32:46.759
point where my I feel very strongly that
 

00:32:46.759 --> 00:32:49.320
point where my I feel very strongly that
I like to try to create projects that

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:49.330
I like to try to create projects that
 

00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:52.599
I like to try to create projects that
for people just by participating in them

00:32:52.599 --> 00:32:52.609
for people just by participating in them
 

00:32:52.609 --> 00:32:55.180
for people just by participating in them
they are empowered and have that

00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:55.190
they are empowered and have that
 

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:57.609
they are empowered and have that
experience rather than me telling them

00:32:57.609 --> 00:32:57.619
experience rather than me telling them
 

00:32:57.619 --> 00:32:59.680
experience rather than me telling them
they should be empowered which I don't

00:32:59.680 --> 00:32:59.690
they should be empowered which I don't
 

00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:02.049
they should be empowered which I don't
think is particularly effective but it's

00:33:02.049 --> 00:33:02.059
think is particularly effective but it's
 

00:33:02.059 --> 00:33:04.060
think is particularly effective but it's
taking me many many projects to sort of

00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:04.070
taking me many many projects to sort of
 

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:06.729
taking me many many projects to sort of
evolve an experiment with that and

00:33:06.729 --> 00:33:06.739
evolve an experiment with that and
 

00:33:06.739 --> 00:33:09.930
evolve an experiment with that and
things that worked and things that have

00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:09.940
things that worked and things that have
 

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:14.649
things that worked and things that have
not worked very well so I'm just gonna

00:33:14.649 --> 00:33:14.659
not worked very well so I'm just gonna
 

00:33:14.659 --> 00:33:16.749
not worked very well so I'm just gonna
go through a bunch of those projects

00:33:16.749 --> 00:33:16.759
go through a bunch of those projects
 

00:33:16.759 --> 00:33:19.299
go through a bunch of those projects
very quickly my background is actually

00:33:19.299 --> 00:33:19.309
very quickly my background is actually
 

00:33:19.309 --> 00:33:25.989
very quickly my background is actually
in film production my my father my

00:33:25.989 --> 00:33:25.999
in film production my my father my
 

00:33:25.999 --> 00:33:27.279

father's side of the family has been in
theater for a bazillion years and my

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:28.850
theater for a bazillion years and my
 

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:30.609
theater for a bazillion years and my
stepfather is an eight-by-ten view

00:33:30.609 --> 00:33:30.619
stepfather is an eight-by-ten view
 

00:33:30.619 --> 00:33:32.859
stepfather is an eight-by-ten view
camera photographer so I thought I was

00:33:32.859 --> 00:33:32.869
camera photographer so I thought I was
 

00:33:32.869 --> 00:33:34.749
camera photographer so I thought I was
gonna rebel by going into the film and

00:33:34.749 --> 00:33:34.759
gonna rebel by going into the film and
 

00:33:34.759 --> 00:33:36.460
gonna rebel by going into the film and
only many years later did I realize it

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:36.470
only many years later did I realize it
 

00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:40.359
only many years later did I realize it
was complete of those two so I started

00:33:40.359 --> 00:33:40.369
was complete of those two so I started
 

00:33:40.369 --> 00:33:44.889
was complete of those two so I started
off by making films and by sort of a

00:33:44.889 --> 00:33:44.899
off by making films and by sort of a
 

00:33:44.899 --> 00:33:46.330
off by making films and by sort of a
mixture of working with people and

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:46.340
mixture of working with people and
 

00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:48.129
mixture of working with people and
putting my vision on it so I'm gonna

00:33:48.129 --> 00:33:48.139
putting my vision on it so I'm gonna
 

00:33:48.139 --> 00:33:49.869
putting my vision on it so I'm gonna
show you just very quickly because this

00:33:49.869 --> 00:33:49.879
show you just very quickly because this
 

00:33:49.879 --> 00:33:50.739
show you just very quickly because this
relates to something we were talking

00:33:50.739 --> 00:33:50.749
relates to something we were talking
 

00:33:50.749 --> 00:33:54.430
relates to something we were talking
about earlier we were asked about

00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:54.440
about earlier we were asked about
 

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.349
about earlier we were asked about
mistakes and things that did not go well

00:33:56.349 --> 00:33:56.359
mistakes and things that did not go well
 

00:33:56.359 --> 00:33:58.419
mistakes and things that did not go well
and I had done a project which went

00:33:58.419 --> 00:33:58.429
and I had done a project which went
 

00:33:58.429 --> 00:34:00.789
and I had done a project which went
horribly wrong and not horribly but not

00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:00.799
horribly wrong and not horribly but not
 

00:34:00.799 --> 00:34:04.989
horribly wrong and not horribly but not
so great and so I made this film in

00:34:04.989 --> 00:34:04.999
so great and so I made this film in
 

00:34:04.999 --> 00:34:07.270
so great and so I made this film in
response to that it's just three minutes

00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:07.280
response to that it's just three minutes
 

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:09.460
response to that it's just three minutes
I hope everything works technically and

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:09.470
I hope everything works technically and
 

00:34:09.470 --> 00:36:41.260
I hope everything works technically and
if not we'll improvise

00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:41.270
 
 

00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:46.880
 
so what I learned from this project was

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:46.890
so what I learned from this project was
 

00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:51.350
so what I learned from this project was
mostly what was surprising to me was

00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:51.360
mostly what was surprising to me was
 

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:52.760
mostly what was surprising to me was
that when I started sending it out to

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:52.770
that when I started sending it out to
 

00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:56.150
that when I started sending it out to
festivals I started getting an

00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:56.160
festivals I started getting an
 

00:36:56.160 --> 00:37:00.800
festivals I started getting an
inordinate number of questions about was

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:00.810
inordinate number of questions about was
 

00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:03.440
inordinate number of questions about was
Bruce Jackson actually disabled or not

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:03.450
Bruce Jackson actually disabled or not
 

00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:05.630
Bruce Jackson actually disabled or not
and it was really shocking to me that

00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:05.640
and it was really shocking to me that
 

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:07.340
and it was really shocking to me that
people would ask that because it was so

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:07.350
people would ask that because it was so
 

00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:08.870
people would ask that because it was so
clear to me that yes he has cerebral

00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880
clear to me that yes he has cerebral
 

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:10.820
clear to me that yes he has cerebral
palsy and he's disabled and I didn't

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:10.830
palsy and he's disabled and I didn't
 

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:12.920
palsy and he's disabled and I didn't
really know where that was coming from

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:12.930
really know where that was coming from
 

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:15.050
really know where that was coming from
and then I had a great conversation with

00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:15.060
and then I had a great conversation with
 

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:17.030
and then I had a great conversation with
dr. he say Barnwell of sweet honey in

00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.040
dr. he say Barnwell of sweet honey in
 

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:20.630
dr. he say Barnwell of sweet honey in
the rock who do the song and I mentioned

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640
the rock who do the song and I mentioned
 

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:23.660
the rock who do the song and I mentioned
it to her and she was like Ruth you have

00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:23.670
it to her and she was like Ruth you have
 

00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:25.550
it to her and she was like Ruth you have
to understand people have compartments

00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:25.560
to understand people have compartments
 

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:27.020
to understand people have compartments
in their brain and they have one

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:27.030
in their brain and they have one
 

00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:28.880
in their brain and they have one
compartment for grace and beauty and

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:28.890
compartment for grace and beauty and
 

00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:31.040
compartment for grace and beauty and
another compartment for disability and

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:31.050
another compartment for disability and
 

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:34.280
another compartment for disability and
they just cannot concede that they would

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:34.290
they just cannot concede that they would
 

00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:37.580
they just cannot concede that they would
be matched together and that was a real

00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:37.590
be matched together and that was a real
 

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:41.060
be matched together and that was a real
eye-opener to me about how narrow the

00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:41.070
eye-opener to me about how narrow the
 

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:43.370
eye-opener to me about how narrow the
portrayal of our lives that we see in

00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:43.380
portrayal of our lives that we see in
 

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:46.100
portrayal of our lives that we see in
our day-to-day lives and it's so easy to

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:46.110
our day-to-day lives and it's so easy to
 

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:48.080
our day-to-day lives and it's so easy to
just step out of that if you tell

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:48.090
just step out of that if you tell
 

00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:49.610
just step out of that if you tell
anything truthful about yourself you

00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:49.620
anything truthful about yourself you
 

00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:51.440
anything truthful about yourself you
pretty much fall out of what is in the

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:51.450
pretty much fall out of what is in the
 

00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:55.280
pretty much fall out of what is in the
accepted dialog so that was a really

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:55.290
accepted dialog so that was a really
 

00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:59.750
accepted dialog so that was a really
great clue for me and I went on to start

00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760
great clue for me and I went on to start
 

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:02.870
great clue for me and I went on to start
making films where I would do a lot of

00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880
making films where I would do a lot of
 

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:05.120
making films where I would do a lot of
research and then write the script and

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:05.130
research and then write the script and
 

00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:07.250
research and then write the script and
then I would go find the population that

00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:07.260
then I would go find the population that
 

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:10.970
then I would go find the population that
was depicted in my work and I would not

00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:10.980
was depicted in my work and I would not
 

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:12.170
was depicted in my work and I would not
show them the script but I would tell

00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:12.180
show them the script but I would tell
 

00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:14.930
show them the script but I would tell
them the story of the film and then we

00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:14.940
them the story of the film and then we
 

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:16.760
them the story of the film and then we
would workshop for many many weeks on

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:16.770
would workshop for many many weeks on
 

00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:19.010
would workshop for many many weeks on
the themes and ideas when we would do

00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:19.020
the themes and ideas when we would do
 

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:21.230
the themes and ideas when we would do
improvisation and theater games just

00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:21.240
improvisation and theater games just
 

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:23.600
improvisation and theater games just
talking about the issues and I would

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:23.610
talking about the issues and I would
 

00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:26.090
talking about the issues and I would
videotape it and then I would take their

00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:26.100
videotape it and then I would take their
 

00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:27.980
videotape it and then I would take their
language and put it back into the

00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:27.990
language and put it back into the
 

00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:29.360
language and put it back into the
structure of the script I had already

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:29.370
structure of the script I had already
 

00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:31.730
structure of the script I had already
created and then we would go and

00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:31.740
created and then we would go and
 

00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:33.320
created and then we would go and
shoot these films and it was a very

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:33.330
shoot these films and it was a very
 

00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:36.200
shoot these films and it was a very
traditional 35 millimeter shoot so they

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:36.210
traditional 35 millimeter shoot so they
 

00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:38.090
traditional 35 millimeter shoot so they
were thrown out of the whole comfortable

00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:38.100
were thrown out of the whole comfortable
 

00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:41.500
were thrown out of the whole comfortable
room of a workshop process for the shoot

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:41.510
room of a workshop process for the shoot
 

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:44.420
room of a workshop process for the shoot
and I was in the midst of doing that and

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:44.430
and I was in the midst of doing that and
 

00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:49.250
and I was in the midst of doing that and
I started to notice some problems for

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:49.260
I started to notice some problems for
 

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:51.560
I started to notice some problems for
myself which was that I was creating

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:51.570
myself which was that I was creating
 

00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:53.750
myself which was that I was creating
these bonus because I wanted to create a

00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760
these bonus because I wanted to create a
 

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:55.609
these bonus because I wanted to create a
transformative experience for the

00:38:55.609 --> 00:38:55.619
transformative experience for the
 

00:38:55.619 --> 00:38:59.150
transformative experience for the
audience and when I would go to screams

00:38:59.150 --> 00:38:59.160
audience and when I would go to screams
 

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:00.650
audience and when I would go to screams
I always would sit at the front by the

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:00.660
I always would sit at the front by the
 

00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:03.109
I always would sit at the front by the
side and I would turn and I'd watch the

00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:03.119
side and I would turn and I'd watch the
 

00:39:03.119 --> 00:39:04.580
side and I would turn and I'd watch the
audience cuz I've seen the movie I

00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:04.590
audience cuz I've seen the movie I
 

00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:06.170
audience cuz I've seen the movie I
didn't care and I would look at

00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:06.180
didn't care and I would look at
 

00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:07.520
didn't care and I would look at
different people to see how they were

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:07.530
different people to see how they were
 

00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:10.910
different people to see how they were
responding in different moments and then

00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:10.920
responding in different moments and then
 

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.230
responding in different moments and then
you sort of realized like when you've

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:12.240
you sort of realized like when you've
 

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:13.670
you sort of realized like when you've
made a film you're stuck like it's

00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:13.680
made a film you're stuck like it's
 

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:15.380
made a film you're stuck like it's
always gonna be the same film you can't

00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:15.390
always gonna be the same film you can't
 

00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:18.170
always gonna be the same film you can't
change you can't do anything and the

00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:18.180
change you can't do anything and the
 

00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:19.850
change you can't do anything and the
same time in a sense the audience is

00:39:19.850 --> 00:39:19.860
same time in a sense the audience is
 

00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:21.830
same time in a sense the audience is
stuck because you're saying you want to

00:39:21.830 --> 00:39:21.840
stuck because you're saying you want to
 

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:24.680
stuck because you're saying you want to
transform them but at the same time

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:24.690
transform them but at the same time
 

00:39:24.690 --> 00:39:27.020
transform them but at the same time
you're asking them to sit silently and

00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:27.030
you're asking them to sit silently and
 

00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:30.020
you're asking them to sit silently and
still in the dark and to be polite and

00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:30.030
still in the dark and to be polite and
 

00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:32.690
still in the dark and to be polite and
good in all those very constricting ways

00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:32.700
good in all those very constricting ways
 

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:36.140
good in all those very constricting ways
and I began to be think about ways that

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:36.150
and I began to be think about ways that
 

00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:39.640
and I began to be think about ways that
we could maybe break out of that model

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:39.650
we could maybe break out of that model
 

00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:42.530
we could maybe break out of that model
but in the midst of that a 911 happened

00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:42.540
but in the midst of that a 911 happened
 

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:48.380

00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:56.930
Street and Soho and what they did is
they would take people could bring in

00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:56.940

00:39:56.940 --> 00:40:00.050
they would take people could bring in
photographs that related to 9/11 and we

00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:00.060
photographs that related to 9/11 and we
 

00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:01.790
photographs that related to 9/11 and we
would scan them and print them and then

00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:01.800
would scan them and print them and then
 

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.440
would scan them and print them and then
hang them on the wall and there was

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:03.450
hang them on the wall and there was
 

00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:05.870
hang them on the wall and there was
hundreds of photographs shown and it

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:05.880
hundreds of photographs shown and it
 

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:09.620
hundreds of photographs shown and it
became a like a makeshift memorial and

00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:09.630
became a like a makeshift memorial and
 

00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:13.609
became a like a makeshift memorial and
also as time progressed a safe place for

00:40:13.609 --> 00:40:13.619
also as time progressed a safe place for
 

00:40:13.619 --> 00:40:14.840
also as time progressed a safe place for
people to engage with their feelings

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:14.850
people to engage with their feelings

other people who were thinking about it

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:19.710
other people who were thinking about it
 

00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:22.039
other people who were thinking about it
you could come to this place and in fact

00:40:22.039 --> 00:40:22.049
you could come to this place and in fact
 

00:40:22.049 --> 00:40:24.230
you could come to this place and in fact
there was lines around the block for

00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240
there was lines around the block for
 

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:27.079
there was lines around the block for
people who needed that safe space in the

00:40:27.079 --> 00:40:27.089
people who needed that safe space in the
 

00:40:27.089 --> 00:40:31.609
people who needed that safe space in the
time after that and I started there as a

00:40:31.609 --> 00:40:31.619
time after that and I started there as a
 

00:40:31.619 --> 00:40:34.880
time after that and I started there as a
volunteer photo editor in early October

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:34.890
volunteer photo editor in early October
 

00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:36.799
volunteer photo editor in early October
and what that meant is I would sit at a

00:40:36.799 --> 00:40:36.809
and what that meant is I would sit at a
 

00:40:36.809 --> 00:40:38.329
and what that meant is I would sit at a
table and people would come to me and

00:40:38.329 --> 00:40:38.339
table and people would come to me and
 

00:40:38.339 --> 00:40:39.410
table and people would come to me and
sometimes they were just like dumped

00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:39.420
sometimes they were just like dumped
 

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:42.200
sometimes they were just like dumped
like hundreds of photographs and we

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:42.210
like hundreds of photographs and we
 

00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:43.940
like hundreds of photographs and we
would sort through them to find the few

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:43.950
would sort through them to find the few
 

00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:46.730
would sort through them to find the few
that would be contributed and I noticed

00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:46.740
that would be contributed and I noticed
 

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:49.760
that would be contributed and I noticed
that there was really interesting things

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:49.770
that there was really interesting things
 

00:40:49.770 --> 00:40:51.410
that there was really interesting things
happening in the stories people were

00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:51.420
happening in the stories people were
 

00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:55.370
happening in the stories people were
telling one is that especially in the

00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:55.380
telling one is that especially in the
 

00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:57.170
telling one is that especially in the
early days the stories were extremely

00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:57.180
early days the stories were extremely
 

00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:59.740
early days the stories were extremely
shattered and often did not make a

00:40:59.740 --> 00:40:59.750
shattered and often did not make a
 

00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:03.529
shattered and often did not make a
logical sense at that point and also

00:41:03.529 --> 00:41:03.539
logical sense at that point and also
 

00:41:03.539 --> 00:41:06.740
logical sense at that point and also
that people would come back and they

00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:06.750
that people would come back and they
 

00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:08.750
that people would come back and they
would say literally identical things

00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:08.760
would say literally identical things
 

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:10.849
would say literally identical things
because they wanted me to say of

00:41:10.849 --> 00:41:10.859
because they wanted me to say of
 

00:41:10.859 --> 00:41:12.799
because they wanted me to say of
identical things in response that then

00:41:12.799 --> 00:41:12.809
identical things in response that then
 

00:41:12.809 --> 00:41:14.210
identical things in response that then
they could go back and correct their

00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:14.220
they could go back and correct their
 

00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:15.770
they could go back and correct their
story as they were starting to piece

00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:15.780
story as they were starting to piece
 

00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:21.710
story as they were starting to piece
things together and I also noticed that

00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:21.720
things together and I also noticed that
 

00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:23.510
things together and I also noticed that
some people were getting silenced and

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:23.520
some people were getting silenced and
 

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:26.089
some people were getting silenced and
that was particularly clear with the

00:41:26.089 --> 00:41:26.099
that was particularly clear with the
 

00:41:26.099 --> 00:41:29.059
that was particularly clear with the
fire fighters at first they had been

00:41:29.059 --> 00:41:29.069
fire fighters at first they had been
 

00:41:29.069 --> 00:41:32.230
fire fighters at first they had been
very open and talking to people and then

00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:32.240
very open and talking to people and then
 

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:35.480
very open and talking to people and then
my interpretation is that a lot of them

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:35.490
my interpretation is that a lot of them
 

00:41:35.490 --> 00:41:37.069
my interpretation is that a lot of them
had the experience of they were supposed

00:41:37.069 --> 00:41:37.079
had the experience of they were supposed
 

00:41:37.079 --> 00:41:39.319
had the experience of they were supposed
to be the heroes so they would talk to

00:41:39.319 --> 00:41:39.329
to be the heroes so they would talk to
 

00:41:39.329 --> 00:41:42.200
to be the heroes so they would talk to
some whatever interviewee interviewer

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:42.210
some whatever interviewee interviewer
 

00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:44.059
some whatever interviewee interviewer
about their experience and then that

00:41:44.059 --> 00:41:44.069
about their experience and then that
 

00:41:44.069 --> 00:41:45.799
about their experience and then that
interview would be shown but it would be

00:41:45.799 --> 00:41:45.809
interview would be shown but it would be
 

00:41:45.809 --> 00:41:48.049
interview would be shown but it would be
edited and the edited version is that

00:41:48.049 --> 00:41:48.059
edited and the edited version is that
 

00:41:48.059 --> 00:41:50.029
edited and the edited version is that
they are a hero and they did some heroic

00:41:50.029 --> 00:41:50.039
they are a hero and they did some heroic
 

00:41:50.039 --> 00:41:53.029
they are a hero and they did some heroic
wonderful thing on 9/11 but their actual

00:41:53.029 --> 00:41:53.039
wonderful thing on 9/11 but their actual
 

00:41:53.039 --> 00:41:56.750
wonderful thing on 9/11 but their actual
experience of it was often much more sad

00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:56.760
experience of it was often much more sad
 

00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:01.730
experience of it was often much more sad
and and that community is very

00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:01.740
and and that community is very
 

00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:03.859
and and that community is very
collaborative and you are not supposed

00:42:03.859 --> 00:42:03.869
collaborative and you are not supposed
 

00:42:03.869 --> 00:42:06.200
collaborative and you are not supposed
to put yourself first before others and

00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:06.210
to put yourself first before others and
 

00:42:06.210 --> 00:42:08.990
to put yourself first before others and
so that interview would be

00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:09.000
so that interview would be
 

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.630
so that interview would be
in this model of heroism and then their

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:11.640
in this model of heroism and then their
 

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:12.890
in this model of heroism and then their
buddies are like what the heck are you

00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:12.900
buddies are like what the heck are you
 

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:14.750
buddies are like what the heck are you
doing like saying this stuff and they're

00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:14.760
doing like saying this stuff and they're
 

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:16.220
doing like saying this stuff and they're
like well I didn't say it that way and

00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:16.230
like well I didn't say it that way and
 

00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:18.170
like well I didn't say it that way and
they're like but we saw it on TV and you

00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:18.180
they're like but we saw it on TV and you
 

00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:20.540
they're like but we saw it on TV and you
did and so they were in and so then they

00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:20.550
did and so they were in and so then they
 

00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:22.099
did and so they were in and so then they
just shut up because they didn't want to

00:42:22.099 --> 00:42:22.109
just shut up because they didn't want to
 

00:42:22.109 --> 00:42:26.660
just shut up because they didn't want to
show their stories so I was thinking

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:26.670
show their stories so I was thinking
 

00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:28.460
show their stories so I was thinking
about stories being the first way that

00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:28.470
about stories being the first way that
 

00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:30.710
about stories being the first way that
we can own our own experience of these

00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:30.720
we can own our own experience of these
 

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:35.240
we can own our own experience of these
kinds of events and so I decided to

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:35.250
kinds of events and so I decided to
 

00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:37.460
kinds of events and so I decided to
create this project voices of 9/11 and

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:37.470
create this project voices of 9/11 and
 

00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:39.500
create this project voices of 9/11 and
we built a booth

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:39.510
we built a booth
 

00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:44.390
we built a booth
I used as a model get the old photo

00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400
I used as a model get the old photo
 

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:46.310
I used as a model get the old photo
booths where you get the strips when you

00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:46.320
booths where you get the strips when you
 

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:47.780
booths where you get the strips when you
sit there and you do your poses and get

00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:47.790
sit there and you do your poses and get
 

00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:48.560
sit there and you do your poses and get
things because I thought that was

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:48.570
things because I thought that was
 

00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:50.089
things because I thought that was
something people feel comfortable with

00:42:50.089 --> 00:42:50.099
something people feel comfortable with
 

00:42:50.099 --> 00:42:53.510
something people feel comfortable with
and one thing I'll say about this

00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:53.520
and one thing I'll say about this
 

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:56.390
and one thing I'll say about this
project is that I think a number of

00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:56.400
project is that I think a number of
 

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:58.520
project is that I think a number of
people since then have asked me how I

00:42:58.520 --> 00:42:58.530
people since then have asked me how I
 

00:42:58.530 --> 00:43:00.290
people since then have asked me how I
did this project technically and I'm

00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:00.300
did this project technically and I'm
 

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:02.030
did this project technically and I'm
always happy to share and tell everyone

00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:02.040
always happy to share and tell everyone
 

00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:03.830
always happy to share and tell everyone
exactly how I did it but then I always

00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:03.840
exactly how I did it but then I always
 

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:05.930
exactly how I did it but then I always
say the technology do not make the

00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:05.940
say the technology do not make the
 

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:08.210
say the technology do not make the
project it was that environment we

00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:08.220
project it was that environment we
 

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:09.740
project it was that environment we
created around it that made it

00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:09.750
created around it that made it
 

00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:13.730
created around it that made it
successful and then they copy the

00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:13.740
successful and then they copy the
 

00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:14.900
successful and then they copy the
technology and they don't do the

00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:14.910
technology and they don't do the
 

00:43:14.910 --> 00:43:16.070
technology and they don't do the
environment and then their projects

00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:16.080
environment and then their projects
 

00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:18.589
environment and then their projects
don't work so if you want to make a

00:43:18.589 --> 00:43:18.599
don't work so if you want to make a
 

00:43:18.599 --> 00:43:20.420
don't work so if you want to make a
video booth I think there was some

00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:20.430
video booth I think there was some
 

00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:23.180
video booth I think there was some
really important things about how we did

00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:23.190
really important things about how we did
 

00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:26.000
really important things about how we did
this project the first is in the first

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:26.010
this project the first is in the first
 

00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:27.740
this project the first is in the first
versions of the video booth they were in

00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:27.750
versions of the video booth they were in
 

00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:29.839
versions of the video booth they were in
the heros New York galleries so people

00:43:29.839 --> 00:43:29.849
the heros New York galleries so people
 

00:43:29.849 --> 00:43:32.089
the heros New York galleries so people
were already there in that space that

00:43:32.089 --> 00:43:32.099
were already there in that space that
 

00:43:32.099 --> 00:43:34.220
were already there in that space that
created a particular environment

00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:34.230
created a particular environment
 

00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:36.260
created a particular environment
she made they also had to make an

00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:36.270
she made they also had to make an
 

00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:38.359
she made they also had to make an
appointment to speak in the booth so

00:43:38.359 --> 00:43:38.369
appointment to speak in the booth so
 

00:43:38.369 --> 00:43:41.240
appointment to speak in the booth so
they've already bought through to some

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:41.250
they've already bought through to some
 

00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:43.280
they've already bought through to some
degree or another what they were gonna

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:43.290
degree or another what they were gonna
 

00:43:43.290 --> 00:43:47.420
degree or another what they were gonna
say later once we got to the Pentagon

00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:47.430
say later once we got to the Pentagon
 

00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:50.210
say later once we got to the Pentagon
for example we were essentially in a

00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:50.220
for example we were essentially in a
 

00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:53.030
for example we were essentially in a
mall and the Pentagon um but it was okay

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:53.040
mall and the Pentagon um but it was okay
 

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:54.349
mall and the Pentagon um but it was okay
because that by then we had enough

00:43:54.349 --> 00:43:54.359
because that by then we had enough
 

00:43:54.359 --> 00:43:57.020
because that by then we had enough
experience to carry people through but

00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:57.030
experience to carry people through but
 

00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:58.820
experience to carry people through but
we had a very specific process for

00:43:58.820 --> 00:43:58.830
we had a very specific process for
 

00:43:58.830 --> 00:44:00.880
we had a very specific process for
people who came to

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:00.890
people who came to
 

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:05.980
people who came to
and that was one of the first things we

00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:05.990

did because you had to fill out a
 

00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:10.750
did because you had to fill out a
release form was the person who brought

going through the process was instructed
 

00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:18.880
going through the process was instructed
to acknowledge wherever that perspi ker

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:18.890

is the booth set up in the Pentagon
 

00:45:08.850 --> 00:45:10.880
is the booth set up in the Pentagon
at a certain point we had when people

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:10.890
at a certain point we had when people
 

00:45:10.890 --> 00:45:12.170

started with me being a benign dictator

00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:05.590
started with me being a benign dictator
 

00:53:05.590 --> 00:53:07.780
started with me being a benign dictator
until I reached the point where people

00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:07.790
until I reached the point where people
 

00:53:07.790 --> 00:53:09.040
until I reached the point where people
were tired of me being a benign

00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:09.050

container and then we formed an

00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:11.210
container and then we formed an
 

00:53:11.210 --> 00:53:13.660

00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:13.670
organizational structure but very far
 

00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:17.680
organizational structure but very far
into the project and I think that's a

00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:22.270
into the project and I think that's a
lot of the time it was really hard to

00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:22.280
lot of the time it was really hard to
 

00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:24.270
lot of the time it was really hard to
get support for the project at first

00:53:24.270 --> 00:53:24.280
get support for the project at first
 

00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:28.030
get support for the project at first
