00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.270
- [Instructor] A particle
moves along the x-axis.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.830
The function x of t gives
the particle's position

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.810
at any time t is greater
than or equal to zero,

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.240
and they give us x of t right over here.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.700
What is the particle's velocity
v of t at t is equal to two?

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.870
So pause this video, see
if you can figure that out.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.970
Well, the key thing to
realize is that your velocity

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.610
as a function of time is
the derivative of position.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.480
And so this is going to be equal to,

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.230
we just take the derivative
with respect to t up here.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.120
So derivative of t to the third

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.530
with respect to t is three t squared.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:36.470
If that's unfamiliar,

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.050
I encourage you to review the power rule.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.910
The derivative of negative four t squared

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.640
with respect to t is negative eight t.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.860
And derivative of three t with
respect to t is plus three.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.610
Derivative of a constant doesn't change

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.930
with respect to time, so that's just zero.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.830
And so here we have velocity
as a function of time.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.180
And so if we want to know our
velocity at time t equals two,

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.010
we just substitute two
wherever we see the t's.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.620
So it's gonna be three times four,

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.070
three times two squared,

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.400
so it's 12 minus eight
times two, minus 16,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.100
plus three, which is
equal to negative one.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.690
And you might say negative one

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.100
by itself doesn't sound like a velocity.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.853
Well, if they gave us
units, if they told us

00:01:20.853 --> 00:01:24.200
that x was in meters and
that t was in seconds,

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.490
well, then x would be,

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:26.990
well, I already said would be in meters,

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.150
and velocity would be negative
one meters per second.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.983
You might also be saying,

00:01:30.983 --> 00:01:32.480
well, what does the negative means?

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.850
Well, that means that we
are moving to the left.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.040
Remember, we're moving along the x-axis.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.350
So if our velocity's negative,

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.320
that means that x is decreasing
or we're moving to the left.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.660
What is the particle's acceleration a of t

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:48.670
at t equals three?

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.420
So pause this video again,
and see if you can do that.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.490
Well, here the realization is

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.473
that acceleration is a function of time.

00:01:55.473 --> 00:01:58.060
It's just the derivative of velocity,

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.320
which is the second
derivative of our position,

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.030
which is just going to be equal to

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.250
the derivative of this right over here.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.750
And so I'm just going to get

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.840
derivative of three t squared
with respect to t is six t.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.610
Derivative of negative eight t

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.870
with respect to t is minus eight.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.580
And derivative of a constant is zero.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.980
So it's just going to
be six t minus eight.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.640
So our acceleration at time t equals three

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.640
is going to be six times three,
which is 18, minus eight,

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.190
so minus eight, which is going
to be equal to positive 10.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.330
All right, now they ask
us what is the direction

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.970
of the particle's motion at t equals two?

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.540
Well, I already talked about
this, but pause this video and

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.623
see if you can answer that yourself.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.800
Well, we've already looked
at the sign right over here.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.850
The fact that we have a
negative sign on our velocity

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.200
means we are moving towards the left.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.530
So I'll fill that in right over there.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.810
At t equals three, is the particle's speed

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.030
increasing, decreasing, or neither?

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.670
So pause this video,
and try to answer that.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.160
All right, now we have
to be very careful here.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.420
If it says is the particle's velocity

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.840
increasing, decreasing, or neither,

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.460
then we would just have to
look at the acceleration.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.650
We see that the acceleration is positive,

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.790
and so we know that the
velocity is increasing.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.210
But here they're not saying
velocity, they're saying speed.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.720
And just as a reminder, speed
is the magnitude of velocity.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.240
So, for example, at time t equals two,

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.450
our velocity is negative one.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.960
If the units were meters and second,

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.860
it would be negative
one meters per second.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.040
But our speed would just
be one meter per second.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.330
Speed, you're not talking
about the direction,

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.470
so you would not have that sign there.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.290
And so in order to figure out

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.410
if the speed is increasing
or decreasing or neither,

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.010
if the acceleration is positive

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.010
and the velocity is positive,

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.550
that means the magnitude of
your velocity is increasing.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.490
So that means your speed is increasing.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.040
If your velocity is negative

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.190
and your acceleration is also negative,

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.700
that also means that
your speed is increasing.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.240
But if your velocity and
acceleration have different signs,

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.650
well, that means that
your speed is decreasing.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.750
The magnitude of your
velocity would become less.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.370
So let's look at our velocity
at time t equals three.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.250
Our velocity at time three, we
just go back right over here,

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.040
it's going to be three times nine,

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.890
which is 27, three times three squared,

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.180
minus 24

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.400
plus three,

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.233
plus three.

00:04:25.233 --> 00:04:28.930
So this is going to be equal to six.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.280
So our velocity and acceleration are both,

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.900
you could say, in the same direction.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.270
They are both positive.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.630
And so our velocity's only
going to become more positive,

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.920
or the magnitude of our velocity
is only going to increase.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.770
So our speed is increasing.

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.190
If our velocity was

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.480
negative at time t equals three,

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.050
then our speed would be decreasing
because our acceleration

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.650
and velocity would be going
in different directions.
