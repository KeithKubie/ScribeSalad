[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:01.882 --> 00:00:03.340
SPEAKER: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan,

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:04.970
and this week, I'm
at the Launchpad

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.357
Space in San Francisco.

00:00:06.357 --> 00:00:08.690
And this is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.990
from Google in the last week.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.420
This week, we introduced
YouTube-BoundingBoxes,

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.360
a dataset consisting of five
million bounding boxes spanning

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.570
23 object categories,
densely labeling segments

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.490
from 210,000 YouTube videos.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.630
To date, this is the largest
manually annotated video

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.790
dataset containing
bounding boxes

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.037
which track objects in
temporally contiguous frames.

00:00:32.037 --> 00:00:33.620
To get started with
this data to train

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.770
your own large-scale models,
take a look at the post linked

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.810
in the description below.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.790
For the tech industry
to thrive and create

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.060
groundbreaking technology that
supports the global ecosystem,

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.860
it is critical to
increase the diversity

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.767
and inclusion of communities
that make the technology.

00:00:48.767 --> 00:00:50.600
To help with that, Women
Techmakers recently

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.540
partnered with Change Catalyst
to develop some resources

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.970
on how to build inclusive
technology hubs.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.550
If you're part of an incubator,
community organization,

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.190
accelerator, or coworking
space, please head

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.840
on over to the post for links
to the videos and how-to guides.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.810
Chrome 57 Beta is now
available with CSS grid

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.810
layout, improved Add to
Homescreen, media session

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.130
API, and more.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.230
All the details are on the post.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.260
By the way, for you progressive
web app enthusiasts,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.660
over the next few weeks,
that Add to Home experience

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.930
in Chrome Beta will integrate
into Android in a much deeper

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.250
way than before.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.870
Progressive web
apps will now appear

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.120
in the app drawer
section of the launcher

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.550
and in Android settings.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.690
It will be able to
receive incoming attempts

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.550
from other apps and more.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.790
Details and screenshots
are on the post.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.420
We recently announced two new
Firebase Admin SDK features.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.600
The Node.js SDK now
contains an Admin API

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.270
for sending messages via
Firebase Cloud Messaging,

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.670
and the Java SDK can
now be initialized

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.410
from a set of
built-in credentials,

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.330
making it easier
to use, especially

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.680
on Google infrastructure.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.320
Details and code
are on the post.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.990
Oh, and if you've got questions
about debugging Firebase Cloud

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.870
Messaging on IOS,
this post is for you.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.500
It's a full debugging guide
with a video and code.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.800
Pre-configured images from
Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.160
and Windows Server Core are now
available on Compute Engine.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.680
High availability
and disaster recovery

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.810
are top of mind for
our large customers,

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.510
so we're also announcing
support for SQL Server,

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.590
always-on availability groups,
and persistent disk snapshots

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.130
integrated with Volume Shadow
Copy Service on Windows Server.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.930

We also have new code labs for
running Windows and .NET apps

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.150
on Google Cloud Platform with
their own dedicated page.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.850
