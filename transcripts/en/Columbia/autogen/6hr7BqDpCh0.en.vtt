coming out because the the last chapter
of my book said it's going to be the

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480
of my book said it's going to be the
 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.420
of my book said it's going to be the
Millennials that are going to turn this

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430
Millennials that are going to turn this
 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.390
Millennials that are going to turn this
country around not at my generation and

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400
country around not at my generation and
 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.399
country around not at my generation and
I think it's really true

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:00.409
I think it's really true
 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:04.879
I think it's really true
the baby boomers are leaving a mess

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889
 
 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:06.350
 
I think the Millennials have to start

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360
I think the Millennials have to start
 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.219
I think the Millennials have to start
fixing it faster perhaps than they

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229
fixing it faster perhaps than they
 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:12.679
fixing it faster perhaps than they
expected and I think that the Occupy

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:12.689
expected and I think that the Occupy
 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:15.980
expected and I think that the Occupy
movement is the beginning of that so let

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990
movement is the beginning of that so let
 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.369
movement is the beginning of that so let
me give you a few minutes of quick take

00:05:19.369 --> 00:05:19.379
me give you a few minutes of quick take
 

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:22.339
me give you a few minutes of quick take
from my perspective of what this is

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:22.349
from my perspective of what this is
 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:24.649
from my perspective of what this is
about and I think Anya is right that

this is part of a worldwide phenomenon
 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:29.659
this is part of a worldwide phenomenon
but each country has its own

characteristics and each part of the US

characteristics and each part of the US
 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:34.670

that's part of this has its own

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680
that's part of this has its own
 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.559
that's part of this has its own
characteristics as well I believe that

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:39.569

I'm just kind of getting people into
 

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:31.030
I'm just kind of getting people into
politics and that doesn't mean getting

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:31.040
politics and that doesn't mean getting
 

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:33.340

them into elections necessarily again

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:33.350
them into elections necessarily again
 

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:36.340
them into elections necessarily again
but it means getting them get going out

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:36.350

mean that's why sort of we went to bat

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:51.140
mean that's why sort of we went to bat
 

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:52.660

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:03.320
activism and so because there's a lot of
 

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:05.020

sort of people that really understand

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:05.030
sort of people that really understand
 

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:06.669
sort of people that really understand
that what will make this more than just

00:29:06.669 --> 00:29:06.679
that what will make this more than just
 

00:29:06.679 --> 00:29:09.130
that what will make this more than just
sort of the people in the park or more

and using it to build organizations and

00:29:14.409 --> 00:29:14.419
and using it to build organizations and
 

00:29:14.419 --> 00:29:16.480
and using it to build organizations and
organizations are that intermediate

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:16.490
organizations are that intermediate
 

00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:19.090
organizations are that intermediate
level between people's beliefs and

level between people's beliefs and
 

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:22.150
level between people's beliefs and
policy and so that's that's kind of got

00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:22.160
policy and so that's that's kind of got
 

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:26.020
policy and so that's that's kind of got
to be the the the intermediate sort of

to be the the the intermediate sort of
 

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:27.669
to be the the the intermediate sort of
step and I think we're seeing that I

00:29:27.669 --> 00:29:27.679
step and I think we're seeing that I
 

00:29:27.679 --> 00:29:29.260

of things along those lines I mean I
 

00:29:32.809 --> 00:29:38.799
of things along those lines I mean I
know there's that there's the yeah so

there's and part of that is going to
 

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:43.360
there's and part of that is going to
involve like more disruption I mean I

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:43.370
involve like more disruption I mean I
 

00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:44.890
involve like more disruption I mean I
want to sort of go to bat for the

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:44.900
want to sort of go to bat for the
 

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:47.470
want to sort of go to bat for the
radicalism of OWS for this idea that

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:47.480
radicalism of OWS for this idea that

you know you don't have it with your
 

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:56.320
you know you don't have it with your
dollars what you have it with is your

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:56.330
dollars what you have it with is your
 

00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:59.799
dollars what you have it with is your
ability to either stop working or hold

00:29:59.799 --> 00:29:59.809
ability to either stop working or hold
 

00:29:59.809 --> 00:30:02.560
ability to either stop working or hold
public space or actually sort of disrupt

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:02.570
public space or actually sort of disrupt
 

00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:05.409
public space or actually sort of disrupt
and impose costs with your because you

00:30:05.409 --> 00:30:05.419
and impose costs with your because you
 

00:30:05.419 --> 00:30:06.909
and impose costs with your because you
don't have money so you should use your

00:30:06.909 --> 00:30:06.919
don't have money so you should use your
 

00:30:06.919 --> 00:30:10.150
don't have money so you should use your
bodies and so that those sort of those

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:10.160
bodies and so that those sort of those
 

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:12.850
bodies and so that those sort of those
tactics of disruption are kind of really

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:12.860
tactics of disruption are kind of really
 

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:16.630
tactics of disruption are kind of really
important and and I want to can I go to

00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:16.640
important and and I want to can I go to
 

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:20.680
important and and I want to can I go to
my graph now oh no sorry Suresh going to

I guess oh really fast there's your f

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:27.130
I guess oh really fast there's your f
 

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:29.100
I guess oh really fast there's your f
and then okay super by yeah thank you

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:29.110
and then okay super by yeah thank you
 

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:32.130
and then okay super by yeah thank you
okay so so this is a graph from Douglas

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:32.140
okay so so this is a graph from Douglas

the civil rights movement so this is

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:36.900
the civil rights movement so this is
 

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:41.130
the civil rights movement so this is
1955 through 1962 and these are the big

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:41.140
1955 through 1962 and these are the big
 

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:44.250
1955 through 1962 and these are the big
solid line is is movement actions and

00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:44.260
solid line is is movement actions and
 

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:45.600
solid line is is movement actions and
there's a couple of things about this

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:45.610
there's a couple of things about this
 

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:47.070
there's a couple of things about this
graph i really like one is the time

00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:47.080
graph i really like one is the time
 

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:51.810

scale this goes from 55 to 62 and you'll

00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:51.820
scale this goes from 55 to 62 and you'll
 

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:54.000
scale this goes from 55 to 62 and you'll
see that for a long time it's a lot of

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:54.010
see that for a long time it's a lot of
 

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:56.220
see that for a long time it's a lot of
like low level stuff going on and then

00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:56.230
like low level stuff going on and then
 

00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:58.080
like low level stuff going on and then
you start seeing as sort of a really big

00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:58.090
you start seeing as sort of a really big
 

00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:00.240
you start seeing as sort of a really big
spike and then it's sort of when you

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:00.250
spike and then it's sort of when you
 

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:01.620
spike and then it's sort of when you
show this the physicist there like that

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:01.630
show this the physicist there like that
 

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:02.850
show this the physicist there like that
looks like an earthquake that's like

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:02.860
looks like an earthquake that's like
 

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:03.690
looks like an earthquake that's like
something you'd read off in a

00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:03.700
something you'd read off in a
 

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:07.410
something you'd read off in a
seismometer and the other thing about it

00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:07.420
seismometer and the other thing about it
 

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:09.270
seismometer and the other thing about it
that's sort of the point of the paper is

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:09.280
that's sort of the point of the paper is
 

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:13.260
that's sort of the point of the paper is
actually how much the the new spikes are

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:13.270
actually how much the the new spikes are
 

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:16.560
actually how much the the new spikes are
driven by by tactical innovation that

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:16.570
driven by by tactical innovation that
 

00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:19.590
driven by by tactical innovation that
the first big spike is is when is when

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:19.600
the first big spike is is when is when
 

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:22.890
the first big spike is is when is when
sit-ins sort of become a tactic and so

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:22.900
sit-ins sort of become a tactic and so
 

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:24.420
sit-ins sort of become a tactic and so
then you just see this explosion of

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:24.430
then you just see this explosion of
 

00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:27.300
then you just see this explosion of
sit-ins in civil rights and then that

00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:27.310
sit-ins in civil rights and then that
 

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:29.370
sit-ins in civil rights and then that
dies down and then people come up with

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:29.380
dies down and then people come up with
 

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:31.050
dies down and then people come up with
these community campaigns and then that

00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:31.060
these community campaigns and then that
 

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:33.330
these community campaigns and then that
takes off and so I think there's some

00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:33.340
takes off and so I think there's some
 

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:36.030
takes off and so I think there's some
momentum that like this immediate sir

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:36.040
momentum that like this immediate sir
 

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.700
momentum that like this immediate sir
short sharp bursts and then like a

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:38.710
short sharp bursts and then like a
 

00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:41.040
short sharp bursts and then like a
collapse and then or another one that

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:41.050
collapse and then or another one that
 

00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:43.110
collapse and then or another one that
this is sort of how social movements

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:43.120
this is sort of how social movements
 

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:45.510
this is sort of how social movements
look and that they look this was

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:45.520
look and that they look this was
 

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:48.870
look and that they look this was
disruptive and sojer twin civil rights

00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:48.880
disruptive and sojer twin civil rights
 

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:51.450
disruptive and sojer twin civil rights
is first getting off like everybody in

00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:51.460
is first getting off like everybody in
 

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:53.130
is first getting off like everybody in
the United States thought why did they

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:53.140
the United States thought why did they
 

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:56.850
the United States thought why did they
have to be making such a fuss you know

00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:56.860
have to be making such a fuss you know
 

00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:58.740
have to be making such a fuss you know
why why can't they're gonna they're

00:31:58.740 --> 00:31:58.750
why why can't they're gonna they're
 

00:31:58.750 --> 00:31:59.940

fire that because then you had political
 

01:32:18.130 --> 01:32:19.680
fire that because then you had political
organization and then you can do lots of

01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:19.690
organization and then you can do lots of
 

01:32:19.690 --> 01:32:20.520

they belong and end this terminology was
developed kind of before a lot of the

01:34:37.989 --> 01:34:39.629
critique of it is or it maybe was even
the late 50s or it likes it was just

01:34:39.629 --> 01:34:39.639
the late 50s or it likes it was just
 

01:34:39.639 --> 01:34:42.180
the late 50s or it likes it was just
something there was there's some moment

01:34:42.180 --> 01:34:42.190
something there was there's some moment
 

01:34:42.190 --> 01:34:44.790
something there was there's some moment
for me when I said this is really really

01:34:44.790 --> 01:34:44.800
for me when I said this is really really
 

01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:47.640

01:34:58.470 --> 01:34:58.480
now I think it's really important for
 

01:34:58.480 --> 01:34:59.790
now I think it's really important for
people on universities to keep

01:34:59.790 --> 01:34:59.800
people on universities to keep
 

01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:01.709
people on universities to keep
organizing the majority of people in the

United States however don't go to a
university so I don't think that it's

01:35:05.970 --> 01:35:05.980
university so I don't think that it's
 

01:35:05.980 --> 01:35:07.080
university so I don't think that it's
going to being the focus of this

01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:07.090
going to being the focus of this
 

01:35:07.090 --> 01:35:08.430
going to being the focus of this
movement and people are going to keep

01:35:08.430 --> 01:35:08.440
movement and people are going to keep
 

01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:10.109
movement and people are going to keep
needing to organize where they are and

01:35:10.109 --> 01:35:10.119
needing to organize where they are and
 

01:35:10.119 --> 01:35:12.089
needing to organize where they are and
where they live it is space that's

01:35:12.089 --> 01:35:12.099
where they live it is space that's
 

01:35:12.099 --> 01:35:13.500
where they live it is space that's
relevant to them whether it's their

01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:13.510
relevant to them whether it's their
 

01:35:13.510 --> 01:35:15.780
relevant to them whether it's their
faith community or wherever I think that
