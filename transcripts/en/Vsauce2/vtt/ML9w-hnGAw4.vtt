pearl necklace.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.969

But if that's not retro enough use a Cuckoo
clock instead. This Etsy page features handmade

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.140
modern cuckoo clocks with a retro twist.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.140

have realized Valentine's Day is quickly approaching.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.160
So grab one of these State valentines for
your sweetheart because like they say in Louisiana,

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.790
"I wanna be loved Bayou."

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.110
If love isn't in the air for you, just buy
some canned love air. And make sure to pick

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.690
up some canned New York City air that's 20%
Empire State Building air but may contain

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.710
traces of the Bronx.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.570
If fake love from a can won't impress your
valentine get them this fake Kitten Bouquet

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.780
instead. That'll help you say those awkward
three words I love meow.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.450
For the dudes, ditch the chocolate and pick
up some Beer-flavored jelly beans.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.999
Or maybe this fancy Barrel-aged Sriracha.

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:18.249

And then say goodnight and go to bed in this
couples sleeping bag.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.329
But if you're in the wilderness you might
need this USB mask for allergies, to protect

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:51.200
you from pollen.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.069

Now that your'e energized strap these wheels
onto your shoes for instant skates.

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.369
And light them up with LED programmable light
strips.

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.920
Then relax in the shower with some whiskey
soap that also comes in bacon and coffee flavors...

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.510
I mean scents.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.950
Go nuclear on dirt and grime with nuclear
soap instead.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.360

tabs that keep track of all your most cherished

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.090
items. Using the accompanying app you can
track your pets, your keys, or if you forgot

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.870
your phone before you drive away.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.360
You won't need for this all in one kitchen
bottle that keeps eight essential kitchen

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.860
tools in one place.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.540

no one messes with your grub.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.230
Maybe this Table of Thrones is more your style
that includes the codename, region, and house

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.250
color of each character.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.070
Then play Ozobot, a smart robot meant to bridge
the digital and physical worlds to re-invent

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.760
the classic boardgame.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.670
Be sure to get your cat some armor to protect
you from other humans.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.290
