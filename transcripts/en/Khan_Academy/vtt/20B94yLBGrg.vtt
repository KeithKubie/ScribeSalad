00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.453
- [Narrator] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:02.453 --> 00:00:06.120
is think about the significant
empires that formed

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.138
shortly before the European
colonization of the Americas.

00:00:10.138 --> 00:00:13.320
In particular, we're going
to focus on the Inca Empire.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.880
In other videos, we have
talked about the Aztecs.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.381
But what's interesting
is this period of time

00:00:18.381 --> 00:00:21.464
in the 15th and early 16th centuries,

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.018
when these empires form,
but then shortly thereafter,

00:00:27.018 --> 00:00:29.019
about a hundred years after they form,

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:32.316
they are conquered by the
Spanish conquistadors.

00:00:32.316 --> 00:00:35.277
So let's focus on the Inca Empire,

00:00:35.277 --> 00:00:37.247
but keep it in comparison
to some of the other

00:00:37.247 --> 00:00:42.234
significant empires and
civilizations we know about.

00:00:42.234 --> 00:00:45.819
As we enter into the 15th century,

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:48.435
we have the kingdom of Cuzco.

00:00:48.435 --> 00:00:52.970
What we now call the Inca
Empire did not exist yet.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.015
The ninth ruler of the kingdom of Cuzco,

00:00:57.015 --> 00:01:00.512
a gentleman by the name of Pachacuti,

00:01:00.512 --> 00:01:02.562
he decides to go on a fairly aggressive

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:04.283
effort of expansion.

00:01:04.283 --> 00:01:07.559
It is Pachacuti that takes the Incas

00:01:07.559 --> 00:01:11.930
from the kingdom of Cuzco,
and creates an empire.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.582
Now as I mentioned, they did
not call themselves the Incas.

00:01:15.582 --> 00:01:18.302
Inca was actually their word for ruler.

00:01:18.302 --> 00:01:21.080
So this was Pachacuti Inca.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.381
Their name for the empire
that gets started by Pachacuti

00:01:25.381 --> 00:01:26.798
was Tawantinsuyu.

00:01:28.644 --> 00:01:31.134
What's it's really referring
to is the four regions.

00:01:31.134 --> 00:01:35.127
You can see the four regions
here that were conquered,

00:01:35.127 --> 00:01:37.476
with Cuzco at the center.

00:01:37.476 --> 00:01:39.783
One of the interesting things is that

00:01:39.783 --> 00:01:41.364
right around the same time,

00:01:41.364 --> 00:01:43.012
we talk about it in another video,

00:01:43.012 --> 00:01:45.372
you have the Aztec Empire forming.

00:01:45.372 --> 00:01:48.391
The Aztec civilization
exists well before that,

00:01:48.391 --> 00:01:51.891
as does the pre-Inca Empire civilizations.

00:01:52.796 --> 00:01:55.522
But in the 15th century
is also when you have

00:01:55.522 --> 00:01:57.685
the Aztec Empire form.

00:01:57.685 --> 00:02:00.049
The Mayan civilization, by this point,

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.194
is in its post-classical period.

00:02:02.194 --> 00:02:04.771
It's classical period is
in bold right over here.

00:02:04.771 --> 00:02:08.415
But there's still many
independent Mayan city states

00:02:08.415 --> 00:02:10.732
in the Yucatan Peninsula.

00:02:10.732 --> 00:02:12.991
But the two notable empires here

00:02:12.991 --> 00:02:15.601
are the Aztecs and the Incas,

00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:18.665
which form in the 15th century.

00:02:18.665 --> 00:02:21.772
What makes them an empire
is that you have one group,

00:02:21.772 --> 00:02:24.969
in the case of the Incas,
the kingdom of Cuzco,

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:29.278
conquering other peoples,
and taking tribute from them.

00:02:29.278 --> 00:02:32.541
Now what was interesting about the Incas

00:02:32.541 --> 00:02:35.355
is that they were able to
form this large empire,

00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:37.318
the largest empire in the Americas

00:02:37.318 --> 00:02:39.839
at the time of the European conquest.

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:43.212
This empire had 10 million people in it.

00:02:43.212 --> 00:02:45.051
What's amazing is that you have this

00:02:45.051 --> 00:02:48.585
large, powerful empire with
significant building projects.

00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:50.232
This is a picture of Machu Pichu.

00:02:50.232 --> 00:02:51.651
Historians believe that it was built

00:02:51.651 --> 00:02:53.881
as an estate for Pachacuti.

00:02:53.881 --> 00:02:56.234
So they were able to do
sophisticated construction

00:02:56.234 --> 00:02:59.891
despite not having a written
system as we know it.

00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:03.803
They had a system of knots for
some forms of record keeping.

00:03:03.803 --> 00:03:05.501
But despite that, they were able to have

00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:07.262
a sophisticated society.

00:03:07.262 --> 00:03:11.844
Their way of taxing people was
not through formal coinage.

00:03:11.844 --> 00:03:14.716
They didn't have a monetary
system as we know it.

00:03:14.716 --> 00:03:16.558
Members of their society had to dedicate

00:03:16.558 --> 00:03:20.376
a proportion of their labor to the empire,

00:03:20.376 --> 00:03:21.626
to the emperor.

00:03:22.765 --> 00:03:25.038
This might seem different than what we do,

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:26.167
but if you think about it,

00:03:26.167 --> 00:03:30.334
if my income is taxed at
30% or 35% in, say, the US,

00:03:31.585 --> 00:03:33.671
essentially what I'm
giving to the government

00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:36.035
is 35% of the work of my labor.

00:03:36.035 --> 00:03:37.747
I'm just doing it through
a monetary system.

00:03:37.747 --> 00:03:38.942
They did it directly.

00:03:38.942 --> 00:03:40.401
A certain percentage of my labor would

00:03:40.401 --> 00:03:43.117
directly have to be for the empire.

00:03:43.117 --> 00:03:47.560
That's how things like Machu
Pichu actually got built.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.310
This was called the Mit'a system.

00:03:51.257 --> 00:03:54.757
Well, like the case with the Aztec Empire,

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:59.530
the Inca Empire lasts for about 100 years

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.105
until the Conquistadors
come into the picture.

00:04:03.105 --> 00:04:06.092
Francisco Pizarro in particular,

00:04:06.092 --> 00:04:09.643
on his third expedition,
is able to conquer

00:04:09.643 --> 00:04:11.810
this powerful Inca Empire.

00:04:12.778 --> 00:04:16.660
He does this with only
several hundred men.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.493
But they were far better
armed than the Incas.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.277
But many historians believe there was also

00:04:23.277 --> 00:04:26.619
complacency on the part of
the Inca ruler at the time.

00:04:26.619 --> 00:04:29.513
He didn't believe that these Conquistadors

00:04:29.513 --> 00:04:32.320
would be able to overtake his army

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.570
that numbered in the tens of thousands.
