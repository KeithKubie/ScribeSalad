00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:01.767
Found my mark.

00:00:01.767 --> 00:00:03.860
In two, one, action.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.066
AL BERMAN: My name
is Al Berman, I'm

00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:12.266
the executive producer and
showrunner of Yellowstone Live.

00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:13.734
JEFF HOGAN: Name is Jeff Hogan.

00:00:13.734 --> 00:00:17.567
I'm going to be filming
beavers, possibly some cougars.

00:00:17.567 --> 00:00:20.300
AL BERMAN: Nobody's
really had the vision

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.100
to take on something this big.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.066
National Geographic
is the first.

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:28.567
JEFF HOGAN: My passion for the
wildlife came before my passion

00:00:28.567 --> 00:00:30.200
for filmmaking.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.233
When I'm in the
wilds, I'm at home.

00:00:32.233 --> 00:00:34.500
AL BERMAN: This is how
the wildlife really is

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.667
in Yellowstone, in real time.

00:00:36.667 --> 00:00:40.200
It's kind of like the
ultimate reality documentary.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.600
Here we go.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.233
AL BERMAN: Yellowstone
it is one of the biggest

00:00:43.233 --> 00:00:44.867
volcanoes in the world.

00:00:44.867 --> 00:00:47.333
I wouldn't be surprised
if we're all surprised.

00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.033
JEFF HOGAN: This is real.

00:00:49.033 --> 00:00:50.667
This is live.

00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:52.266
Anything can happen.

00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:55.700
That's the magic in Yellowstone.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.633
I think that's good.

00:00:56.633 --> 00:00:57.266
AL BERMAN: Cool.

00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:58.867
That was great guys.
