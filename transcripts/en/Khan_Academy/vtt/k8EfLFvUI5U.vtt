00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.830
Write the equation of the
line that has a slope of 1/3

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.490
and contains the point
negative 12, negative 14/3.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.080
So the equation of
a line we can write

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.500
as y is equal to mx plus b.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.940
This is in slope-intercept
form, where m is our slope

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.230
and b right over here
is our y-intercept.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.540
And they have actually
given us our slope.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.550
Our slope, they tell us, is 1/3.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.590
So we know that m
is going to be 1/3.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.720
So we know that y is
equal to 1/3 x plus b.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.870
And so now we just
have to solve for b.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.610
And the way we can solve for
b is that we know this line

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.523
contains the point
negative 12, negative 14/3.

00:00:48.523 --> 00:00:54.410
So when x is equal
to negative 12,

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.821
y is equal to negative 14/3.

00:01:02.114 --> 00:01:03.682
So let's write that down.

00:01:03.682 --> 00:01:10.700
Negative 14/3 is going
to be equal to 1/3--

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.010
our slope-- times
our x value, which

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.410
is negative 12-- times
negative 12-- and then plus b.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.120
So when x is
negative 12, we know

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.450
that y is equal
to negative 14/3.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.300
And we also know that
the slope is 1/3.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.430
That's the m in mx plus b.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.440
So now we can just solve for b.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.770
The left-hand side-- I'll just
leave it as negative 14/3--

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.480
is equal to 1/3
times negative 12.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.810
1/3 times negative
12 is negative 4,

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.737
so this is negative 4, plus b.

00:01:47.737 --> 00:01:51.076
Let me write the plus
b in that same color

00:01:51.076 --> 00:01:52.433
that I had started it with.

00:01:52.433 --> 00:01:55.370
Plus b.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.940
It looks like a yellow color.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.590
And now, to isolate b
on the right-hand side,

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:03.990
we can add 4 to both sides.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.531
I want to get rid
of this negative 4.

00:02:05.531 --> 00:02:07.160
So let's add 4 to both sides.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.920
So plus 4, plus 4-- on
the right-hand side,

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.770
we're left with just a b.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.960
b is equal to-- on the
left-hand side, we have 4.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.380
4 I can rewrite.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.060
Because I'm going to have
to add 4 to negative 14/3.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.520
So I want a common denominator.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.990
4 is the same thing as 12/3.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.215
So 4 is 12/3, minus 14/3.

00:02:36.086 --> 00:02:37.210
So I just want to be clear.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.500
I just rewrote the 4 as 12/3.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.000
So 12/3 minus 14/3, or
negative 14/3 plus 12/3,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.550
is going to give us-- well, we
have the same denominator of 3.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.640
So we're going to have 3.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.590
12 minus 14 is negative 2.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.910
So we have negative
2/3 is equal to b.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.350
So the equation of the
line we figured out.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.320
They gave us the slope.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.500
And now we just figured
out the y-intercept

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.861
using this information
right over here.

00:03:06.861 --> 00:03:08.360
So the equation of
our line is going

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:15.050
to be y is equal to 1/3 x-- we
got the 1/3 from the problem--

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.500
plus b. b is negative 2/3.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.000
So I could just write minus 2/3.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.920
And we are done.
