00:00:00.674 --> 00:00:03.811
- [Instructor] Let g of x be
equal to the definite integral

00:00:03.811 --> 00:00:07.196
from zero to x of f of t dt.

00:00:07.196 --> 00:00:10.951
What is an appropriate
calculus-based justification

00:00:10.951 --> 00:00:15.889
for the fact that g is concave
up on the open interval

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:17.051
from five to 10?

00:00:17.051 --> 00:00:18.846
So concave up.

00:00:18.846 --> 00:00:21.584
So before I even think about
what it means to be concave up,

00:00:21.584 --> 00:00:23.758
let's just make sure we
understand this relationship

00:00:23.758 --> 00:00:25.266
between g and f.

00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:28.121
One way to understand it is
if we took the derivative

00:00:28.121 --> 00:00:30.496
of both sides of this equation,

00:00:30.496 --> 00:00:34.663
we would get that g prime
of x is equal to f of x.

00:00:37.347 --> 00:00:38.308
The derivative of this

00:00:38.308 --> 00:00:40.796
with respect to x would just be f of x.

00:00:40.796 --> 00:00:42.309
In fact, the whole
reason why we introduced

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.359
this variable t here is
this thing right over here

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:47.553
is actually a function of x

00:00:47.553 --> 00:00:49.312
'cause x is this upper bound.

00:00:49.312 --> 00:00:51.905
And it would've been weird if
we had x as an upper bound,

00:00:51.905 --> 00:00:53.208
or at least confusing,

00:00:53.208 --> 00:00:55.183
and we were also integrating
with respect to x.

00:00:55.183 --> 00:00:57.879
So we just had to pick kind of
another placeholder variable.

00:00:57.879 --> 00:00:58.764
Didn't have to be t.

00:00:58.764 --> 00:01:00.327
It could be alpha, it could be gamma,

00:01:00.327 --> 00:01:02.714
it could be a, b, or
c, whatever we choose,

00:01:02.714 --> 00:01:07.042
but this is still, right over
here, this is a function of x.

00:01:07.042 --> 00:01:08.693
But when you take the
derivative of both sides,

00:01:08.693 --> 00:01:11.731
you realize that the function
f, which is graphed here.

00:01:11.731 --> 00:01:14.938
And if this were the x axis,
then this would be f of x.

00:01:14.938 --> 00:01:16.784
If this is the t axis,

00:01:16.784 --> 00:01:18.945
then this is y is equal to f of t.

00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:22.303
But generally this is the
graph of our function f,

00:01:22.303 --> 00:01:26.071
which you could also view
as the graph of g prime.

00:01:26.071 --> 00:01:28.863
If this is x, this would be g prime of x.

00:01:28.863 --> 00:01:31.799
And so we're thinking about the interval,

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.124
the open interval from five to 10,

00:01:34.124 --> 00:01:36.979
and we have g's derivative graphed here.

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.031
And we wanna know a
calculus-based justification

00:01:39.031 --> 00:01:43.288
from this graph that lets us
know that g is concave up.

00:01:43.288 --> 00:01:46.335
So what does it mean to be concave up?

00:01:46.335 --> 00:01:50.636
Well, that means that your
slope of tangent line,

00:01:50.636 --> 00:01:54.219
of tangent, slope of
tangent is increasing.

00:01:56.685 --> 00:01:58.619
Or another way of thinking about it,

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.119
your derivative is increasing.

00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:04.190
Or another way to think about it,

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.022
if your derivative is
increasing over an interval,

00:02:06.022 --> 00:02:08.868
then you're concave up on that interval.

00:02:08.868 --> 00:02:11.077
And so here we have a
graph of the derivative,

00:02:11.077 --> 00:02:14.159
and it is indeed increasing
over that interval.

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:16.306
So our calculus-based justification

00:02:16.306 --> 00:02:17.813
that we'd wanna use is that, look,

00:02:17.813 --> 00:02:21.992
f, which is g prime, is
increasing on that interval.

00:02:21.992 --> 00:02:23.651
The derivative is
increasing on that interval,

00:02:23.651 --> 00:02:26.238
which means that the original
function is concave up.

00:02:26.238 --> 00:02:28.095
f is positive on that interval.

00:02:28.095 --> 00:02:32.084
That's not a sufficient
calculus-based justification.

00:02:32.084 --> 00:02:34.294
Because if your derivative is positive,

00:02:34.294 --> 00:02:36.251
that just means your original
function is increasing.

00:02:36.251 --> 00:02:37.084
It doesn't tell you

00:02:37.084 --> 00:02:39.933
that your original function is concave up.

00:02:39.933 --> 00:02:42.853
f is concave up on the interval.

00:02:42.853 --> 00:02:45.081
Well, just because your
derivative is concave up

00:02:45.081 --> 00:02:48.109
doesn't mean that your original
function is concave up.

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:51.859
In fact, you could have
a situation like this

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.847
where you're concave
up over that interval,

00:02:55.847 --> 00:02:58.292
but for much of that
interval right over here,

00:02:58.292 --> 00:03:02.132
if this was our graph of f or
g prime, we are decreasing.

00:03:02.132 --> 00:03:04.912
And if we're decreasing
over much of that interval,

00:03:04.912 --> 00:03:06.336
then actually on this part

00:03:06.336 --> 00:03:08.998
our original function
would be concave down.

00:03:08.998 --> 00:03:12.277
The graph of g has a cup
U shape on the interval.

00:03:12.277 --> 00:03:14.308
Well, if we had the graph of g,

00:03:14.308 --> 00:03:16.022
this would be a justification,

00:03:16.022 --> 00:03:18.821
but it wouldn't be a
calculus-based justification.

00:03:18.821 --> 00:03:21.291
Let's do more of these.

00:03:21.291 --> 00:03:25.393
So this next one says, so we
have the exact same setup,

00:03:25.393 --> 00:03:27.137
which actually all of
these examples will have.

00:03:27.137 --> 00:03:29.135
g of x is equal to this thing here.

00:03:29.135 --> 00:03:31.216
What is an appropriate
calculus-based justification

00:03:31.216 --> 00:03:35.254
for the fact that g has a relative minimum

00:03:35.254 --> 00:03:36.903
at x equals eight?

00:03:36.903 --> 00:03:39.632
So once again, they've graphed f here,

00:03:39.632 --> 00:03:43.377
which is the same thing
as the derivative of g.

00:03:43.377 --> 00:03:45.403
And so if we have the
graph of the derivative,

00:03:45.403 --> 00:03:48.178
how do we know that we
have a relative minimum

00:03:48.178 --> 00:03:50.124
at x equals eight?

00:03:50.124 --> 00:03:52.545
Well, the fact that we cross,

00:03:52.545 --> 00:03:57.102
that we're at the x-axis,
that y is equal to zero,

00:03:57.102 --> 00:04:00.675
that the derivative is equal
to zero at x equals eight,

00:04:00.675 --> 00:04:02.534
that tells us that the
slope of the tangent line

00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:04.237
of g at that point is zero.

00:04:04.237 --> 00:04:05.539
But that alone does not tell us

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:07.377
we have a relative minimum point.

00:04:07.377 --> 00:04:09.379
In order to have a relative minimum point,

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:14.207
our derivative has to cross
from being negative to positive.

00:04:14.207 --> 00:04:15.730
Why is that valuable?

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.852
Because think about if
your derivative goes

00:04:17.852 --> 00:04:19.587
from being negative to positive,

00:04:19.587 --> 00:04:21.503
that means your original function goes

00:04:21.503 --> 00:04:24.577
from decreasing to increasing.

00:04:24.577 --> 00:04:27.104
It goes from decreasing to increasing.

00:04:27.104 --> 00:04:29.508
And so you would have a
relative minimum point.

00:04:29.508 --> 00:04:31.788
And the choice that describes that,

00:04:31.788 --> 00:04:33.052
this is starting to get there,

00:04:33.052 --> 00:04:36.470
but this alone isn't enough
for a relative minimum point.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.373
f is negative before x equals eight

00:04:38.373 --> 00:04:40.050
and positive after x equals eight.

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.538
That's exactly what we just described.

00:04:42.538 --> 00:04:43.487
Let's see about these.

00:04:43.487 --> 00:04:47.593
f is concave up on the
interval around x equals six.

00:04:47.593 --> 00:04:50.720
Well, x equals six is a
little bit unrelated to that.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.854
There's an interval in the
graph of g around x equals eight

00:04:54.854 --> 00:04:57.290
where g of eight is the smallest value.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.766
Well, this would be a justification
for a relative minimum,

00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:01.683
but it is not calculus-based.

00:05:01.683 --> 00:05:04.602
So once again I'll rule
that one out as well.

00:05:04.602 --> 00:05:06.880
Let's do one more of these.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.851
So same setup, although we
have a different f and g here,

00:05:10.851 --> 00:05:13.361
and we see it every time with the graph.

00:05:13.361 --> 00:05:16.193
What is a appropriate
calculus-based justification

00:05:16.193 --> 00:05:20.372
for the fact that g is
positive on the interval

00:05:20.372 --> 00:05:23.374
from the closed interval from seven to 12?

00:05:23.374 --> 00:05:28.047
So the positive on the closed
interval from seven to 12.

00:05:28.047 --> 00:05:29.097
So this is interesting.

00:05:29.097 --> 00:05:30.160
Let's just remind ourselves.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.902
Here we're gonna think a little bit deeper

00:05:31.902 --> 00:05:34.011
about what it means to
be this definite integral

00:05:34.011 --> 00:05:35.604
from zero to x.

00:05:35.604 --> 00:05:39.771
So, if we think about what
happens when x is equal to seven.

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:44.427
When x is equal to seven, or
another way to think about it,

00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:47.448
g of seven is going to be the integral

00:05:47.448 --> 00:05:50.115
from zero to seven of f of t dt.

00:05:51.993 --> 00:05:53.778
And so the integral from zero to seven,

00:05:53.778 --> 00:05:54.867
if this was a t-axis,

00:05:54.867 --> 00:05:58.291
and, once again, t is just
kind of a placeholder variable

00:05:58.291 --> 00:06:00.788
to help us keep this x up here.

00:06:00.788 --> 00:06:04.614
But we're really talking about
this area right over here.

00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:07.154
And because from zero to seven

00:06:07.154 --> 00:06:09.233
this function is above the x-axis,

00:06:09.233 --> 00:06:11.896
this is going to be a positive area.

00:06:11.896 --> 00:06:14.292
This is a positive area.

00:06:14.292 --> 00:06:16.643
And as we go from seven to 12,

00:06:16.643 --> 00:06:19.150
we're not adding anymore area,

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.125
but we're also not taking any away.

00:06:21.125 --> 00:06:24.667
So actually g of seven
all the way to g of 12

00:06:24.667 --> 00:06:26.431
is going to be the same positive value,

00:06:26.431 --> 00:06:28.496
'cause we're not adding anymore value.

00:06:28.496 --> 00:06:30.702
And when I say g of 12,

00:06:30.702 --> 00:06:35.015
g of 12 is going to be
actually equal to g of seven,

00:06:35.015 --> 00:06:37.559
because, once again, no
added area right here,

00:06:37.559 --> 00:06:39.126
positive or negative.

00:06:39.126 --> 00:06:41.081
So let's see which of these choices match.

00:06:41.081 --> 00:06:44.043
For an x value in the
interval from seven to 12,

00:06:44.043 --> 00:06:46.626
the value of f of x is zero.

00:06:48.459 --> 00:06:51.559
That is true, but that doesn't
mean that we were positive.

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:53.294
For example, before that interval

00:06:53.294 --> 00:06:55.398
if our function did something like this,

00:06:55.398 --> 00:06:57.712
then we would've had negative
area up to that point,

00:06:57.712 --> 00:06:59.218
and so these would be negative values,

00:06:59.218 --> 00:07:00.779
so I would rule that out.

00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:03.261
For any x value in the
interval from seven to 12,

00:07:03.261 --> 00:07:07.428
the closed interval, the
value of g of x is positive.

00:07:08.492 --> 00:07:12.404
For any x value in the
interval from seven to 12,

00:07:12.404 --> 00:07:15.058
the value of g of x is positive.

00:07:15.058 --> 00:07:18.538
That is true, so I like this one.

00:07:18.538 --> 00:07:19.884
Let me see these other ones.

00:07:19.884 --> 00:07:24.051
f is positive over the closed
interval from zero to seven,

00:07:25.846 --> 00:07:29.179
and it is non-negative over seven to 12.

00:07:31.094 --> 00:07:32.602
I like this one as well.

00:07:32.602 --> 00:07:34.740
And actually the reason why I
would rule out this first one,

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.202
this first one has nothing
to do with the derivative

00:07:37.202 --> 00:07:39.317
and so it's not a
calculus-based justification,

00:07:39.317 --> 00:07:41.169
so I would rule that one out.

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:42.002
This one is good.

00:07:42.002 --> 00:07:44.073
This is the exact rationale
that I was talking about.

00:07:44.073 --> 00:07:46.192
f is positive from zero to seven,

00:07:46.192 --> 00:07:48.195
so it develops all this positive area,

00:07:48.195 --> 00:07:50.328
and it's non-negative over the interval.

00:07:50.328 --> 00:07:54.082
And so we are going to stay
positive this entire time for g,

00:07:54.082 --> 00:07:58.249
which is the area under f and
above the x-axis from zero

00:07:59.553 --> 00:08:01.887
to our whatever x we wanna pick.

00:08:01.887 --> 00:08:04.192
So I like this choice here.

00:08:04.192 --> 00:08:07.525
f is neither concave up nor concave down

00:08:08.457 --> 00:08:11.957
over the closed interval from seven to 12.

00:08:14.098 --> 00:08:16.169
No, that doesn't really help us

00:08:16.169 --> 00:08:19.644
in saying that g is
positive over that interval.

00:08:19.644 --> 00:08:21.570
So there you go, choice C.
