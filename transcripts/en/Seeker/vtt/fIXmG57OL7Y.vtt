00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.860
Step aside, tyrannasaurus.

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.299
There's a new dinosaur in town and it goes
by the name of Leikupal laticauda.

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:12.370
Not very catchy.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:19.130
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and if you
like dinosaurs, then you're gonna love this

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.130
story.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.110
A new fossil uncovered in Patagonia has provided
the first evidence that certain dinosaurs

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.430
survived the great extinction, and existed
millions of years after they were thought

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.430
to have died off.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.460
The diplodocid sauropod is a family of long-necked,
whip-tailed dinosaurs - made famous by this

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.850
scene from the second Jurassic Park movie.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.120
They are some of the longest creatures to
ever roam the earth, and they were assumed

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.609
to have gone extinct at the end of the Jurassic
era - around 150 million years ago.

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:48.850
Thanks to this new finding, however, researchers
in Argentina now have the earliest record

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.230
of them in existence, dating back to the early
Cretaceous period - around 130 million years

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.230
ago.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.710
Even more interesting, it was found in a place
they never expected: South America.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.640
Eight vertebrae were discovered in the rocky
outcrops of the "Bajada Colorada," a Cretaceous-era

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.480
formation in western Argentina.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.930
This is the first time this family of dinosaurs
has been found in any southern land mass,

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.180
aside from Africa - which, according to researchers,
means they must have evolved from other dinosaurs

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.780
before Africa and South America split apart.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.890
Until now, the species was thought to be an
exclusively North American dinosaur.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.120
So this new evidence, researchers say, may
help shed light on how different dinosaurs

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.940
migrated around the globe in response to climate
change.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.570
It's kind of amazing how much we continue
to discover about the world around us.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.920
And I dunno about you guys, but dinosaurs
are one of the most fascinating things in

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.920
the world to me.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.920
Hopefully you agree.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.300

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.740
