00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.830
Welcome to the presentation
on multiplying decimals.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.230
Let's get started.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.120
So I think you'll find out that
multiplying decimals is not a

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.220
lot more difficult than just
multiplying regular numbers.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.460
And I'll show you in a problem.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.940
Let me pick some
random numbers.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:25.590
Let's say I had 7,518.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.590
Actually, let's
make that's 75.18.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.700
Clearly you can tell I'm
doing this on the fly.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:40.010
75.18 times 0.97.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.140
So first you look at this
problem you're like,

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.970
oh boy, that's tough.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.120
These decimals-- I don't even
know how to approach it.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.490
Well this is what you do.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.960
You ignore the decimals when
you start the problem and you

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.640
pretend like it's just a
regular multiplication problem.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.435
And if you ignore the
decimals like I said, at

00:00:53.435 --> 00:00:57.290
the beginning, 7,518 on
top and 97 on the bottom.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.470
And if that doesn't make
sense let me just show you.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.440
I'm just going to ignore the
decimals and do this like a

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.320
normal multiplication problem.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.460
So normal multiplication.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.870
I'd start at the 1's
place right here.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.430
I'd say 7 times 8.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.530
Well, 7 times 8 is 56.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.790
Carry the 5.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.890
7 times 1 is 7.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.020
Plus the 5 is 12.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.490
2 down here.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.300
Carry the 1.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.740
7 times 5 is 35.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.825
Plus the 1 is 36.

00:01:25.825 --> 00:01:27.800
Put the 6 here.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.970
Carry the 3.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.830
And then 7 times 7 is 49.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.700
Plus 2 is 52.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.370
So just put 52 here.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.430
So just like normal
multiplication we just took the

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.850
1's place right here, the 7, so
it's actually not the 1's, but

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.695
we're ignoring the decimals so
if there were no decimals this

00:01:46.695 --> 00:01:48.030
would be the 1's place.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.080
And we're multiplying
it by the top number.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.030
7 times 7,518 is
equal to 52,626.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.230
And like regular
multiplication, we

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.050
do the 10's place.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.450
And this isn't really the 10's
place, but if you ignore

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.030
the decimals it would be.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.120
And let's cross all this stuff
out since we're not using it.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.870
9 times 8 is 72.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.110
Carry the 7.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.260
9 times 1 is 9.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.450
Plus 7 is 16.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.960
Carry the 1.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.870
9 times 5 is 45.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.620
This is good practice for
me too, I haven't done

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.360
my multiplication
tables in a long time.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.320
9 times 5 is 45.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.590
Plus 1 is 46.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.570
Carry the 4.

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.070
9 times 7 is 63.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.710
Plus 4 is 67.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.780
Now we add.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.610
So you're probably thinking,
boy, what do decimals have

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:44.410
to do with this at all.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.090
I'm just doing a regular
multiplication problem.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.530
And I'll show you.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.380
Actually the decimals only come
in right at the very end.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.740
So what I do is now I just add
like I do a regular level

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.790
4 multiplication problem.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.880
So I say 6 plus 0 is 6.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.880
2 plus 2 is 4.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.440
6 plus 6 is 12.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.170
Carry the 1.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.640
1 plus 2 plus 6 is 9.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.990
5 plus 7 is 12.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.260
Carry the 1.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.370
1 plus 6 is 7.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.970
OK, so now here's where the
decimals come into play.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.300
And your I think you're
going to be shocked by how

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.680
straightforward this is.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.770
What I do is I go back to the
original problem and now I

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.430
actually pay attention
to the decimals.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.160
And I say, how many total
numbers are behind

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.610
the decimal point?

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.150
Well, there's 1 number behind
the decimal point, 2 numbers

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.860
behind the decimal point, 3
numbers behind the decimal

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.050
point, 4 numbers behind
the decimal point.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.750
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.860
So there are 4 numbers behind
the decimal point in the

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.330
problem I did, and
I just count here.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.810
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.930
The answer will also have 4
numbers behind the decimal

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.620
point, and that's the answer.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.190
72.9246.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.750
Now let me ask you a question.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:08.870
If I had a 0 here, would that
count as an extra number

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.010
behind the decimal point?

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.785
Well, it only would have been
if you actually used the

00:04:14.785 --> 00:04:16.820
0 in the multiplication.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.770
Maybe that confuses you.

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:21.220
What I would recommend if
you have any trailing 0's

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.660
with a decimal like this.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.000
you actually should just ignore
those 0's and then do the

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.610
problem just the way I did it.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.140
And when remember, that's
only for trailing 0's.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.270
If this was the bottom number
then that 0 would matter

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.770
because it's not a trailing 0,
it's actually part

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.260
of the number.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.070
Let's do a couple more examples
and I think that'll make sense.

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.830
So let's say I had 5-- and
I'm going to do a simpler

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.600
example arithmetically.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.070
I think it'll help you
with some principles.

00:04:52.070 --> 00:05:00.880
If I said 5.10 times 1.09.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.020
So there's two
things we could do.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.560
We could just multiply
it the way it is.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.840
Actually let's do it both ways
and I'll show you you get the

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.150
same answer whether or
not you ignore that 0.

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.460
So in the first case
let's not ignore the 0.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.440
Let's use that 0, even though
that trailing 0 in the

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.600
decimal-- 5.10 is the
same thing as 5.1.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.750
But let's use it.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.680
9 times 0 is 0.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.990
9 times 1 is 9.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.570
9 times 5 is 45.

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.820
And in the 0's place
you put a 0 and then 0

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.885
times everything is 0.

00:05:32.885 --> 00:05:36.780
0 times 0, 0 times
1, 0 times 5.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:37.740
Put two 0's here.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.190
And then 1 times 0 is 0.

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.880
1 times 1 is 1.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.550
And 1 times 5 is 5.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.420
And now we add it all.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:51.750
We get 0, 9, 5, 5, 5.

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.430
And like we did before, we
just count the decimals.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.650
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.450
So 1, 2 3, 4.

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.730
So the decimal will go here.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:03.470
So we got 5.5590 as the answer.

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.140
Now what if we did like
I was recommending, we

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.950
actually ignored the 0?

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:15.320
And I can actually rewrite
it as 1.09 times 5.1.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.490
Because you know in
multiplication order

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:17.510
doesn't matter.

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.940
a times b is the same
thing as b times a.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.010
2 times 3 is the same
thing as 3 times 2.

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:27.695
So 1.09 times 5.1 is the same
thing as 5.1 times 1.09.

00:06:27.695 --> 00:06:29.320
So let's just
multiply this out.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.590
And notice, these are
the same numbers.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.340
All I did is I took the 0 off.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.900
So first, I just ignore the
decimals I say 1 times 9 is 9.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.110
1 times 0 is 0.

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.200
1 times 1 is 1.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.910
Put a 0 here.

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:48.240
5 times 9 is 45.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.720
Carry the 4.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.070
5 two 0 is 0.

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.060
Plus 4 is 4.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.410
5 times 1 is 5.

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:58.830
Now I add.

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:04.290
9, 5, 5, 5.

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.890
Now I'm at the point that I
can actually pay attention

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:09.040
to the decimal points.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.890
How many numbers are
behind the decimals?

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:14.010
Well, there's 1, 2, 3.

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:18.330
So I go 1, 2, 3 and put the
decimal point right here.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.520
Notice I got the
same exact answer.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.610
The only difference is that
this one had a trailing 0,

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.630
which really doesn't make
a number any different.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:27.400
I could add a hundred 0's
here and the number's really

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.490
not a different number.

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:33.950
If you were a computer
programmer or a statistician

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:35.250
of some kind, this could
be an important number.

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:36.520
But ignore what I just said.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:41.360
And for your purposes, these
trailing 0's mean nothing.

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.700
Same way a leading 0 actually
wouldn't mean nothing.

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:47.500
No one ever does that.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:51.900
Well, let me see how
much time I have.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:52.470
I have 2 more minutes.

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:55.520
Let me do one more problem just
to maybe hit the point home.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:02.770
You know, this is really
no different than level

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:03.820
4 multiplication.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.020
And at the end you just
have to count the numbers

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:07.620
behind the decimal point.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:11.040
So 5 times 5 is 25.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.390
Whoops.

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:12.680
25.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.580
I'm already getting messy.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:15.910
Carry the 2.

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:18.030
5 times 7 is 35.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.870
Plus 2 is 37.

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:23.380
Bring down the 7, carry the 3.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.710
5 times 0 is 0.

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:26.455
Plus 3.

00:08:26.455 --> 00:08:29.340
So it's 375, ignore that blob.

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:30.485
I'm sorry for being so messy.

00:08:30.485 --> 00:08:32.010
And then you put a 0.

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:34.620
1 times 5 is 5.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.870
1 times 7 is 7.

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:38.270
Ignore that.

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:39.114
Now we add.

00:08:39.114 --> 00:08:41.510
We say 5 plus 0 is 5.

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:44.430
7 plus 5 is 12.

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:47.060
1 plus 3 plus 7 is 11.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:48.320
So we got our answer,
now we just have to

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.820
count the decimals.

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:55.610
So here we have 1, 2,
3, 4, 5 numbers behind

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:56.860
the decimal point.

00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:00.100
But in our answer we only have
4 digits, so how can we get 5

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:01.610
numbers behind the
decimal point?

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:03.090
Well, we start here.

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:08.820
We say 1, 2, 3, 4 and we need
one more number behind the

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.770
decimal point, so
we add a 0 here.

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:13.090
And then we put the
decimal point.

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:14.380
See what I just did.

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:18.030
We had to have 5 numbers
behind the decimal point.

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:20.080
And we only had 4
numbers in the answer.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.950
So I added a leading 0 and
then put the decimal point.

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:26.990
And now we have 5 numbers
behind the decimal point.

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:29.390
And I've shown you a very
mechanical way of doing this.

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:32.030
Hopefully in the future I can
give you a seminar on actually

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:35.510
why this method of counting the
numbers behind the decimal

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:37.070
points actually works.

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:40.340
But I think you are ready
to try some problems on

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:41.890
multiplying decimals.

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:43.400
Have fun.
