In today's video,

00:00:01.027 --> 00:00:03.621
we are taking eggs prepared
in a variety of ways,

00:00:03.621 --> 00:00:05.100
and putting them
to the test,

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.000
seeing how well they stay
on the freeze drying process.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.180
[Music]

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.600
Guys, Dominic Termine
said try freeze-drying

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.200
a raw and cooked egg.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.367
Well, I think that sounds
like an awesome idea.

00:00:20.367 --> 00:00:23.100
But I think we can actually push
that a little bit further.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.226
We have a lot of eggs,

00:00:24.226 --> 00:00:27.300
and I want to try and prepare
these in a lot of strange ways,

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.770
maybe some not so strange

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.900
because eggs are
actually very well known

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.700
for freeze-drying very well
and keeping that way.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.000
I want to push
that limit and see just

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.550
how weird we can make our eggs,

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.300
and see if they're actually
going to survive this process.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.542
All right, we've got our freeze
dryer all ready to go.

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:44.700
We've got our eggs,
it's time to cook some of these.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.800
Let's start with
a few basic eggs.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.440
We're going to hard
boil a couple of these.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:01:12.360
[Music]

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.580
Scrambled eggs.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.700
That one is ready to go.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:28.640
[Music]

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.580
Alright, we've got
our three types of cooked eggs.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.400
So we're going to go ahead,
and get those set up.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.300
Now, we're going to add
a few more to this tray.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.890
So we've got
lots of comparisons.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.898
Our hard boiled egg, over easy,

00:01:37.898 --> 00:01:40.898
and some scrambled,
but I want to add a few more.

00:01:40.898 --> 00:01:43.400
So let's go ahead and
add just a raw egg.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.624
That's supposed to work really
well in the freeze dryer,

00:01:45.624 --> 00:01:47.000
and I want to put
that to the test.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.220
[Music]

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.500
Another thing I'm very curious
about is just a whole raw egg.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.900
And last but not least,

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.800
we have got three
cooked eggs, two raw,

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.800
but I want to put
something else in there.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.400
Now I have here a naked egg.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.200
Now, these are so
much fun, you guys,

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.949
and you can actually
make these at home.

00:02:03.949 --> 00:02:06.550
You'll see that this egg
doesn't have a shell anymore.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:07.500
It's almost bouncy.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.840
It's still raw,
and it still held together.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.900
All you need to do is put
distilled white vinegar

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.449
into a cup,

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:14.450
and drop an egg into it
for about 24 hours.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.400
Now what's going to happen is
the acetic acid in the vinegar

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.035
is actually going to eat
away the calcium carbonate

00:02:20.035 --> 00:02:20.800
of the shell.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.900
When that happens,
it starts to dissolve away.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.400
What you end up with is an egg
that looks like this.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.249
So you can see here,

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:29.200
the acetic acid actually ate
away all the calcium carbonate,

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.500
and now, you get this soft
squishy cracked shell.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.200
If you run it under some water
and clean it up,

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.100
you get a naked egg.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.866
Let's throw this in
with the rest of them,

00:02:36.866 --> 00:02:37.900
get these freeze-drying.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.320
[Music]

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.900
All right.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.900
So we have let our eggs
freeze dry overnight,

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.000
and I'm pretty sure one
of them has exploded.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.692
So I want to take
a look at that.

00:02:49.692 --> 00:02:51.760
So let's turn off the machine
and see what happened.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.260
[Music]

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.700
All right, everything
seems to have worked,

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.500
except for our vinegar egg.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.900
It's like powdered meringue,
that is a disaster.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.200
I want to see the footage.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.700
I want to know
what happened there.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.465
All right, so we

00:03:03.465 --> 00:03:06.000
have three different angles
of the GoPros to show just

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.880
what happened here,

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:08.600
and I want to know,

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.800
mostly, I'm very confused
about what happened

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.700
to our vinegar egg.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.840
There's nothing in
between those two shots.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.200
It just explodes.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:18.640
My goodness.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.720
And then everything just
sort of shrink back down

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.180
and stays that way.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.958
All right, what did
the other angle pick up?

00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:24.900
We can still see

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.800
that everything's starting
to freeze and shrink up,

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.600
and this is

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.100
a two-second difference
between these two frames,

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.129
and that's insane.

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:33.600
That thing just exploded.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.670
All right Dominic,

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.800
we've tried a lot
of weird things with these eggs.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.500
So let's see what
the results are.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.980
As you can see,
our vinegar egg was just...

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.800
It's like meringue, almost.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.000
It's just powder.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.300
Here's that soft rubbery shell
that was left in it.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.100
You can see
where that split was.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.400
These two pieces actually
stayed decently intact.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.020
Yep, still very very
strong vinegar smell.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.280
All right, this is awesome.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.000
This is a freeze-dried
round egg yolk,

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.940
and it actually
feels very dense.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.600
This is our
freeze-dried hard-boiled egg,

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.200
and it's definitely lighter
than an egg should be,

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.800
but it still feels a lot denser
than things you normally find

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.600
in a freeze dryer.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.900
But this egg yolk that was
in our vinegar egg is solid.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.024
Oh, that's weird.

00:04:19.024 --> 00:04:20.530
It comes apart in layers.

00:04:21.146 --> 00:04:22.300
No, not Center.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.000
Whoop!

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.420
There it goes.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.620
Freeze-dried vinegar rotten egg.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.860
Cool.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.600
Next up is our raw eggs.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.000
I don't know if I can peel it,
but we're gonna try.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.980
[Music]

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.620
That's the coolest.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.340
[Music]

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.740
Freeze-dried raw egg.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.320
And this also has the consistency
of almost a meringue,

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.480
which is awesome.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.440
So, can you freeze
dry a solid raw egg?

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:48.300
You can.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.532
I'm not sure what
the purpose would be,

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:50.400
but you can do it.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.300
Now, this was just
our raw egg cracked in a bowl,

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.100
and then left.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.541
Now, I'm going to leave
this one for last

00:04:55.541 --> 00:04:57.656
because I actually want to try
a few experiments with this.

00:04:57.656 --> 00:04:58.199
I want to see

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:00.900
if you can reconstitute a raw
freeze dried egg for cooking,

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.700
so we'll set this one aside.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.400
And we're going to look at are
freeze-dried cooked eggs.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.300
This one's probably
the funniest to me.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.900
A hard-boiled freeze dried egg.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.500
Like the other
ones are awesome,

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.800
because yeah...

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.200
That, that weighs nothing.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.320
This is just over easy hard egg.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.120
[Music]

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.100
They're not terrible.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.000
That's still edible.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.970
I don't know
if you'd ever want egg crackers,

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:26.800
but you can do it.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.500
And I'm actually very curious
about the scrambled eggs,

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.100
because supposedly,
you can reconstitute those.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.800
You throw them in the skillet
with some hot water,

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.682
and you should be able
to bring them back to life.

00:05:35.682 --> 00:05:36.582
So I want to see.

00:05:36.582 --> 00:05:37.800
But just as comparison,

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.940
these are two eggs
that I made this morning,

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.880
and these are freeze dried ones.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.940
So if you compare these,
as far as looks go,

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.500
they haven't changed nearly
as much as some other foods

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.580
that we've made in the past
in this freeze dryer.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.780
[Music]

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.500
All right. So everything that's
on this tray has been cooked.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.117
So even though it's
been freeze-dried

00:05:57.117 --> 00:05:59.500
or anything like that,
these are all technically safe.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.100
So an egg that was cooked
about 10 minutes ago...

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.780
[Music]

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.080
Regular cook egg.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.780
This monstrosity.

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.920
[Music]

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:11.960
Well, it fell apart.

00:06:11.962 --> 00:06:12.900
It's just crumble.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.200
I can't even pick that up.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.700
As far as taste goes,
it definitely tastes different.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.470
It's hard to put
your finger on why.

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.840
[Music]

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.780
I'd almost say it has more
flavor, which is interesting,

00:06:25.792 --> 00:06:26.597
because in the past,

00:06:26.597 --> 00:06:28.389
we've noticed that things
in the freeze dryer,

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:29.784
if you try
and reconstitute them,

00:06:29.784 --> 00:06:30.700
lose a lot of flavor,

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:31.740
but even before that,

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.100
this has a lot more flavor going
in than I would have expected.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.300
Let's go to hard boiled.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.020
[Music]

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.900
It is not wanting
to stay together.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:40.800
Oh, okay.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.900
That's also interesting.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.900
The egg white is
just flaking apart.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.620
But the egg yolk in this
is very resistant.

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:54.160
[Music]

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:54.740
Nope.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:55.320
Nope.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:55.820
Nope.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.280
Okay, everything else is fine.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.523
I do not recommend
freeze-drying hard-boiled eggs.

00:07:03.523 --> 00:07:05.600
The center is still frozen.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.193
But the taste is definitely off.

00:07:07.193 --> 00:07:08.500
That's a little bit strange.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.028
Let's see if we can bring those
scrambled eggs back to life,

00:07:11.028 --> 00:07:12.700
and then I'm curious
about that raw egg.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.800
Supposedly, you can use raw eggs

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.400
that have been freeze
drying in cooking,

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.850
just like you can fresh eggs.

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:18.950
So I want to try that.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:21.300
Just like reconstituting
anything, we're gonna add

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:22.400
a little bit of water,

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.620
see if we can turn
that into egg.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:31.700
[Music]

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.400
They're getting sort
of squishy again.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:40.500
[Music]

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:41.000
After everything

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.200
that we've tried in
our Harvest Right freeze dryer,

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.082
this is the best thing
that's turned out.

00:07:45.082 --> 00:07:47.200
This actually tastes just
like scrambled eggs.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.073
That is awesome
that you can do that.

00:07:49.073 --> 00:07:51.000
All right, let's put
this to the test.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.820
We're going to have equal
ingredients for our mug cakes,

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:55.307
toss in one freeze dried egg,

00:07:55.307 --> 00:07:57.000
one raw egg,
and see what happens.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.580
[Music]

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.000
So 10 tablespoons
of your cake mix.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:03.900
For mug cakes,

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.000
you don't really need
to be that specific.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.380
[Music]

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.100
Teaspoon of vegetable oil.

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.760
[Music]

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:12.600
Add our eggs.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.100
Now, for our raw egg,
we are going to remove the yolk

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.300
because we did
that for the freeze dried egg.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:22.080
[Music]

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.000
Seems right.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.280
[Music]

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.100
And then for water,

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.320
I just add water until you
get a cake batter consistency.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.950
So obviously, we're going
to need more water

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:34.149
in our freeze dried egg,

00:08:34.149 --> 00:08:35.800
but the result
should be the same.

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.210
Much less water in this one.

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:40.460
[Music]

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.160
All right, so the first thing
that I'm noticing is

00:08:43.172 --> 00:08:45.218
while they have
the same consistency,

00:08:45.218 --> 00:08:48.630
mostly, their water content
seems to be about the same now.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:51.685
Our one with the freeze-dried
eggs is definitely less tacky,

00:08:51.685 --> 00:08:53.332
less sticky, and I'm wondering

00:08:53.332 --> 00:08:55.200
if that's going
to affect anything.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.900
Regular egg cake mug.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:03.020
[Music]

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:04.500
It's a little doughy on top,

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.635
but these mugs apparently
top out at about one minute

00:09:06.635 --> 00:09:07.394
for our mug cakes.

00:09:07.394 --> 00:09:09.172
All right, so we had
about the same amount.

00:09:09.172 --> 00:09:11.417
You can already see how much
a mug cake just rises up.

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.900
So hopefully, we'll get the same
result with our powdered egg.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:15.660
[Music]

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:16.960
That was about one minute.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.640
So I'll do the same.

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:22.480
[Music]

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:26.520
Oh, wow, it actually looks
fluffier than our regular egg.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.700
But they rose to almost
the exact same height.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:32.200
They both have one giant bubble
right in the middle.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.410
Taste test time.

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:34.890
Regular first.

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:38.260
[Music]

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.100
Cherry chip cake,
which is awesome.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.696
Freeze dried egg, just powdered,
not even powdered well,

00:09:43.696 --> 00:09:45.200
and tossed into a cake.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.620
[Music]

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:50.800
Literally, no difference.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:51.800
That is awesome.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.038
You can freeze dry your eggs.

00:09:53.038 --> 00:09:54.583
You don't have
to use the egg yolk.

00:09:54.583 --> 00:09:56.400
You don't even have
to powderize it well,

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.100
and you can cook with it.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.175
That is amazing.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:00.400
I am thrilled.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.000
Also, I have cake for lunch.

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:05.060
Can you freeze
dry eggs in any form?

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:05.700
Yes, you can.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.200
Can you reconstitute them,
and use them in cooking?

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.500
You can do that too.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.400
Should you freeze dry
all types of eggs?

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.680
Probably not.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.500
Harvest Right, thank
you so much for letting

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.325
us use your freeze dryer
for these experiments.

00:10:16.325 --> 00:10:17.000
Guys, if you want

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.788
to see anything else
super weird freeze-dried,

00:10:18.788 --> 00:10:20.100
let us know
in the comments below.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.000
Guys, that's not all,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.377
we've always got more
for you to see.

00:10:23.377 --> 00:10:25.423

and that box at the bottom is

00:10:26.559 --> 00:10:28.400
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.319
