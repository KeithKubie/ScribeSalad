00:00:08.186 --> 00:00:09.656
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So, one, two, three, go.

00:00:09.816 --> 00:00:12.026
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Whether
they are learning how

00:00:12.026 --> 00:00:15.846
to teach a first grade
science lesson..

00:00:16.536 --> 00:00:17.676
&gt;&gt;Student: One, two, three.

00:00:17.676 --> 00:00:19.186
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Or how to save a life,

00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:22.486
students at South Grand Prairie
High School, near Arlington, Texas,

00:00:22.486 --> 00:00:23.946
are pursuing their passions.

00:00:24.076 --> 00:00:25.526
&gt;&gt;Shawnda: BP is 130 over 70.

00:00:25.826 --> 00:00:28.996
&gt;&gt;Narrator: As sophomores,
students can choose to enroll in one

00:00:29.046 --> 00:00:32.716
of five academies that will
prepare them for college and careers

00:00:32.716 --> 00:00:35.216
in everything from accounting to art,

00:00:35.756 --> 00:00:38.796
from building bridges,
to building arguments.

00:00:39.136 --> 00:00:40.746
&gt;&gt;Student: He spots these two,

00:00:41.106 --> 00:00:46.646
and with this jealous rage
consuming him, he murders them.

00:00:46.776 --> 00:00:50.646
&gt;&gt;Roy: What we found out is that we
weren't successful with 60 percent

00:00:50.646 --> 00:00:54.046
of the students, that yes, they were
graduating, yes, they were moving

00:00:54.046 --> 00:00:57.166
on to life after high
school, but not at the level

00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:58.906
that we would like to see them.

00:00:58.906 --> 00:01:02.846
So we decided that old phrase,
what's good for one is good for all,

00:01:02.846 --> 00:01:06.676
and go to wall-to-wall academies
for all 2,500 students, to give each

00:01:06.676 --> 00:01:10.096
and every one of them an opportunity
to explore, to experiment,

00:01:10.186 --> 00:01:13.256
to find out what they wanted to do,
and yes, to find out, what, perhaps,

00:01:13.256 --> 00:01:15.046
they didn't want to do
after they graduated.

00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:16.996
&gt;&gt;Debra: When we first
went to academies,

00:01:16.996 --> 00:01:20.216
we were really fighting
the concept that moving

00:01:20.216 --> 00:01:24.556
to career academies was
dumbing down and just catering

00:01:24.556 --> 00:01:29.046
to vocational skills, and that
we were throwing academic rigor

00:01:29.046 --> 00:01:29.836
out the window.

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:31.876
And that's not it at all.

00:01:31.876 --> 00:01:33.366
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Where is your
roadway going to be?

00:01:33.476 --> 00:01:35.046
&gt;&gt;Student: Right here at the top.

00:01:35.636 --> 00:01:36.836
&gt;&gt;Debra: What we're trying to do is,

00:01:36.836 --> 00:01:40.316
we're trying to give our
students some marketable skills,

00:01:40.396 --> 00:01:43.376
either in their career,
or skills on a high level,

00:01:43.416 --> 00:01:45.766
that they can use in the workplace.

00:01:46.186 --> 00:01:50.586
So perhaps, instead of flipping
burgers to earn some college money,

00:01:50.586 --> 00:01:52.596
they are repairing computers.

00:01:53.216 --> 00:01:56.266
&gt;&gt;Stephanie: It's great being in the
academy, because you get to learn

00:01:56.266 --> 00:01:59.146
with the people that want
to do the same thing, like,

00:01:59.186 --> 00:02:02.036
being in big school, people
may distract the class,

00:02:02.036 --> 00:02:04.916
and or not wanting to be there,
but when you're in academy,

00:02:04.916 --> 00:02:07.976
everyone wants to be in that academy,
and you're able to learn more.

00:02:08.136 --> 00:02:09.946
&gt;&gt;Chuck: Hi, guys, what have we got?

00:02:10.226 --> 00:02:12.976
&gt;&gt;Shawnda: We've got
an 18 year old female,

00:02:12.976 --> 00:02:16.036
her initial BP was 130
over 70, pulse is 64--

00:02:16.036 --> 00:02:17.706
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Most of the
academies invite professionals,

00:02:17.706 --> 00:02:20.196
like flight paramedic Chuck
Skinner, to volunteer as mentors.

00:02:20.286 --> 00:02:21.376
&gt;&gt;Student: INO times
three at that point,

00:02:21.686 --> 00:02:22.976
and respirations were still 18.

00:02:23.266 --> 00:02:25.366
&gt;&gt;Chuck: Rather than this pie
in the sky kind of education,

00:02:25.366 --> 00:02:27.826
where we all hold hands, sing
Kumbaya, and read Socrates,

00:02:27.826 --> 00:02:31.036
we actually are talking about
stuff that matters today.

00:02:31.036 --> 00:02:33.516
I mean, they'll come out of
school ready to go to work.

00:02:33.516 --> 00:02:35.386
We have jobs waiting
for some of these guys.

00:02:35.786 --> 00:02:38.866
&gt;&gt;Narrator: If they do well in the
course, and pass a battery of tests,

00:02:39.096 --> 00:02:42.866
students can graduate as certified
emergency medical technicians.

00:02:43.226 --> 00:02:44.996
&gt;&gt;Shawnda: And being able
to know what I'm doing

00:02:44.996 --> 00:02:48.656
and actually take charge and do
it, it really makes me happy,

00:02:48.656 --> 00:02:52.416
because if you think about it, that's
a real patient, you saved their life.

00:02:52.416 --> 00:02:54.766
I mean, you were part of that,
you got to save their life,

00:02:54.766 --> 00:02:56.066
if, of course, they live.

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:59.586
But I mean, you help them,
and you get to help them

00:02:59.586 --> 00:03:01.636
and it's just-- it's so much fun.

00:03:01.696 --> 00:03:04.656
&gt;&gt;Barbara: The formalwear that
you just started, I like this,

00:03:04.656 --> 00:03:07.416
but we always want to include
some type of background, so--

00:03:07.596 --> 00:03:10.066
&gt;&gt;Narrator: While students in
the arts academy are given time

00:03:10.066 --> 00:03:13.186
to experiment and express
themselves, the focus,

00:03:13.186 --> 00:03:15.936
as with the other academies,
is on pursuing a career.

00:03:16.046 --> 00:03:21.476
&gt;&gt;Barbara: Students are working
toward pulling together their very

00:03:21.476 --> 00:03:25.366
best talents and skills,
and take art very seriously.

00:03:25.426 --> 00:03:27.476
&gt;&gt;Student: I kind of would
like to maybe do swimwear.

00:03:28.066 --> 00:03:30.836
&gt;&gt;Barbara: By their senior year, they
are able to walk out of high school

00:03:31.206 --> 00:03:33.096
with a completed portfolio, and able

00:03:33.096 --> 00:03:37.986
to possibly get college
credit from that portfolio.

00:03:37.986 --> 00:03:41.716
They actually are not just doing
class work and projects just

00:03:41.716 --> 00:03:46.066
to get a grade, they are doing it
for higher purpose, they are doing it

00:03:46.066 --> 00:03:48.266
for something that will
affect their future.

00:03:48.976 --> 00:03:52.826
&gt;&gt;Tuyet: I see other schools
that don't have the AP Program,

00:03:53.176 --> 00:03:57.566
and I really feel sorry for
them, because I'm getting, like,

00:03:57.566 --> 00:04:01.606
a lot of experience, getting
chances to win a lot of contests,

00:04:01.676 --> 00:04:05.456
and get my name out, and I
definitely want to pursue, you know,

00:04:05.456 --> 00:04:09.206
art as a career, so I think
it's a great opportunity.

00:04:10.086 --> 00:04:14.566
&gt;&gt;Debra: We are trying to create a
positive atmosphere for our students

00:04:14.566 --> 00:04:19.716
and for our teachers, by
letting them explore things

00:04:19.716 --> 00:04:23.766
that they're interested in,
letting them be with people

00:04:23.766 --> 00:04:28.366
that are exploring similar things,
so they have the same kind of likes

00:04:28.366 --> 00:04:30.466
and dislikes, and the
same directions,

00:04:30.926 --> 00:04:33.766
and that makes them happier.

00:04:33.766 --> 00:04:35.656
&gt;&gt;Student: Can you
wiggle your fingers?

00:04:35.876 --> 00:04:36.186
Good job.

00:04:36.186 --> 00:04:37.866
&gt;&gt;Roy: What I see many
times from students,

00:04:37.866 --> 00:04:39.976
is that they truly have
that sense of belonging.

00:04:40.276 --> 00:04:44.196
It provides an individual an
opportunity and a reason and a desire

00:04:44.196 --> 00:04:45.866
to come to South Grand
Prairie High School.

00:04:46.276 --> 00:04:50.266
I think that we are a very diverse
school here, and everyone fits in,

00:04:50.266 --> 00:04:52.336
and I guess that's
what's exciting to see,

00:04:52.336 --> 00:04:54.606
that everyone can,
and they do succeed.

00:04:54.606 --> 00:04:56.216
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So we're
going to try again.

00:04:56.926 --> 00:04:59.756
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Success at South
Grand Prairie High School,

00:04:59.756 --> 00:05:01.746
often leads directly to a job.

00:05:02.236 --> 00:05:05.816
In a unique program
called, Ready, Set, Teach,

00:05:06.186 --> 00:05:09.686
the district has been able to
grow its own future teachers.

00:05:09.826 --> 00:05:14.796
&gt;&gt;Ann: Ready, Set, Teach is a
practical hands on experience

00:05:15.146 --> 00:05:17.576
and in some ways, it's-- would be

00:05:17.576 --> 00:05:21.406
like the student teaching
at a college level.

00:05:21.546 --> 00:05:24.886
We cover a lot of different
things, the philosophy of education,

00:05:25.166 --> 00:05:28.596
different management
techniques in the classroom.

00:05:29.046 --> 00:05:31.296
&gt;&gt;And you don't have to
always know the answer.

00:05:31.296 --> 00:05:35.046
You can say, I don't know, but what?

00:05:36.086 --> 00:05:37.896
And let's find out together.

00:05:37.996 --> 00:05:39.296
Oh, move to the head of the class.

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:42.166
&gt;&gt;Jacquelyn: First I got
into psychology, and I did--

00:05:42.166 --> 00:05:44.166
I even did AP Psychology,
and then I was like, oh,

00:05:44.166 --> 00:05:47.146
I don't want to do that, so I was
like, well there's Ready, Set, Teach.

00:05:47.626 --> 00:05:50.706
&gt;&gt;Narrator: After spending their
first six weeks in course study,

00:05:50.706 --> 00:05:55.716
students like, Jacqui Gonzalez get to
test their newfound teaching skills

00:05:55.716 --> 00:05:58.116
in the crucible of a
first grade classroom.

00:05:58.226 --> 00:06:02.006
&gt;&gt;Jacquelyn: You have to have
a lot of patience with them.

00:06:02.116 --> 00:06:03.496
I think that's the
most difficult thing.

00:06:03.496 --> 00:06:07.196
You have to be really patient,
because there's like, 20 of them,

00:06:07.196 --> 00:06:09.296
and they all want to talk at
the same time, and I want to go

00:06:09.296 --> 00:06:12.086
to the bathroom, and you
have to be really patient.

00:06:12.136 --> 00:06:14.206
I think that's the most
difficult thing about it.

00:06:14.466 --> 00:06:15.636
&gt;&gt;Need you all to listen.

00:06:15.636 --> 00:06:18.666
The next thing-- we need the paper,

00:06:18.786 --> 00:06:21.366
because I don't know
what the next step is.

00:06:21.366 --> 00:06:24.016
&gt;&gt;Usually when I tell people, ooh,
this is what I do, they're, what?

00:06:24.016 --> 00:06:26.666
You're doing that in high school,
and you're not even in college yet?

00:06:26.736 --> 00:06:29.856
&gt;&gt;The spoon that has
one fourth, uno cuarto.

00:06:29.856 --> 00:06:32.496
&gt;&gt;I guess some people in
college don't even get to be

00:06:32.496 --> 00:06:34.926
with the students as much as
I am with them during the day.

00:06:34.926 --> 00:06:37.816
&gt;&gt;Narrator: After successfully
completing the course,

00:06:37.816 --> 00:06:41.496
and getting letters of recommendation
from the teachers they work with,

00:06:41.976 --> 00:06:45.606
students are eligible to receive a
letter of intent from the district,

00:06:45.936 --> 00:06:47.976
offering a first job in
their teaching career.

00:06:48.106 --> 00:06:49.776
&gt;&gt;Jacquelyn: What did
you all just smell?

00:06:49.916 --> 00:06:50.116
&gt;&gt;Student: Yukky.

00:06:50.686 --> 00:06:52.696
&gt;&gt;Jacquelyn: It stunk, right, and
what about-- what did you all hear?

00:06:52.696 --> 00:06:53.706
&gt;&gt;Student: It was like a S-S-S..

00:06:54.306 --> 00:06:54.976
&gt;&gt;Jacquelyn: It was sizzling, right?

00:06:55.076 --> 00:06:58.026
&gt;&gt;Kristin: I was really pleased
to hear Jacqui vocalize, "Wow,

00:06:58.026 --> 00:07:00.946
I was really glad when this
student had this response.

00:07:00.946 --> 00:07:01.646
He really got it."

00:07:01.646 --> 00:07:05.246
She went through a lot of the
ah-has, and the feelings of success

00:07:05.556 --> 00:07:07.486
that one goes through
when one begins to teach.

00:07:07.606 --> 00:07:08.196
&gt;&gt;Jacquelyn: Watch again.

00:07:08.196 --> 00:07:08.263
&gt;&gt;All: [Laughing].

00:07:08.263 --> 00:07:13.476
&gt;&gt;Kristin: And it's wonderful if
they can have those experiences,

00:07:13.476 --> 00:07:15.236
because of opportunities
they had in high school.

00:07:15.236 --> 00:07:17.976
&gt;&gt;Jacquelyn: No, high, real high.

00:07:18.516 --> 00:07:20.546
&gt;&gt;All: [Cheering].

00:07:21.046 --> 00:07:22.156
