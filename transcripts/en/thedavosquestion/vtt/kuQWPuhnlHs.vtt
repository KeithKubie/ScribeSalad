00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400
&gt;&gt; Can India become a superpower?
Well, of course it can.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:10.700
The question is will it and how quickly?
Without getting into all the details I think

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.309
there are many reasons why
several experts believe that India will become

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.910
an affluent nation
within one generation.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.750
And -- and all of that, as an Indian that
I read, and excited about

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.240
what I read, and deeply will that to happen,
there are 2 or 3

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.410
challenges that India would face if it were
to face it were to become a

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.120
superpower.
First is finding a model which will drive

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.800
inclusive growth without
which the shining India story and India becoming

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.320
a superpower which we
talk about is unlikely to have a fairytale

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.310
ending because there will be
far too many people who will -- who will not

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.290
be part of this wonderful
economic growth story that we're talking about.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.070
So to me, India can become a superpower provided
it embraces the

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.790
criticality of developing a model which will
drive inclusive growth and

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.190
which will get a billion-plus people fully
integrated into the growth

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.130
story that we have.
