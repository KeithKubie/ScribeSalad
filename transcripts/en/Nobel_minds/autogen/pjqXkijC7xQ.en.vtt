at least we can agree that if you're
 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.849
at least we can agree that if you're
going to trim it off you trim it off at

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859
going to trim it off you trim it off at
 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.339
going to trim it off you trim it off at
the end of the beam but these have been

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349
the end of the beam but these have been
 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:14.959

and the green beans didn't know they had
 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.719
and the green beans didn't know they had
to be nine centimeters long so they grow

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:23.729
to be nine centimeters long so they grow
 

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:26.300
