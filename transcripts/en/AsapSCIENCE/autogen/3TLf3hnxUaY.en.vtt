00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
Pleasuring yourself is common with over

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.835
50% of woman and 70% of men masturbating on

00:00:05.835 --> 00:00:07.195
a monthly basis.

00:00:07.615 --> 00:00:10.865
But what would you, just, completely stopped masturbating

00:00:10.865 --> 00:00:11.860
forever?

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.260
after a week male testosterone levels go up by 40%

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.640
or at least that is what a 2003 study found

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.480
Which caught worldwide media attention

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.020
And in part lead to the no fap community

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.020
fapping being slang for masturbating

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.920
supporters of the no fap movement

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.820
also claim improved sexual performance and high sperm quality

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.560
along with feelings of improved motivation

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.300
self-esteem and happiness

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.680
but how valid are all these claims?

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.960
what most media did not mention is that

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.540
while the study did see increased testosterone

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.420
it went back down to normal levels

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.700
on day 8 with no explanation.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.200
other abstinence studies have found no difference

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.240
at all in testosterone levels between those who masturbated and those who abstained

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.240
suggesting that other variables like

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.240
changing diet and exercise

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.440
which also impact testosterone

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.840
may more likely be the cause for any changes found

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.580
in people who stopped masturbating

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.360
in terms of sexual performance

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.160
abstinence from masturbation

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.140
does not seem to improve premature ejaculation either

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.260
after three weeks of no masturbation

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.820
a study found that participants

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.580
had roughly the same ejaculation time as those

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.580
that did not masturbate

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.700
and as for sperm quality

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.140
it turns out that those who ejaculated more frequently

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.140
had sperm that were stronger swimmers

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.520
which improves chances of fertilization

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.040
in fact this is one theory behind why not masturbating

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.040
for extended periods of time

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.040
may lead to more nocturnal admissions

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.100
or wet dreams

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.260
as a mechanism to cycle out  old sperm

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.220
83% of men and 37% of women

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.580
have experienced a wet dream at least once

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.680
but the evidence for why is still in-
conclusive

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.740
as there haven't been many studies given

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.780
the awkward nature of studing

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.740
people orgasm in their sleep

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.020
apart from this for men when sperm isn't ejaculated

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.580
it can be broken down and the nutrients are recycled

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.660
back inside the body

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.300
Now masturbation addiction is a real thing

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.300
and curbing the habit can potentially

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.980
impact your motivation, self-esteem and happiness

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.800
masturbation can increase dopamine and serotonin

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.440
neurotransmitter release which stimulates the reward

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.880
pathway in the brain

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.780
the only issue is that constant masturbation

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.980
leads to constant release of serotonin and dopamine

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.720
which leads to our brain becoming desensitized

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.960
to these specific neurotransmitters

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.400
our brain would then require a higher level of

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.420
dopamine and serotonin

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.440
to obtain normal levels of happiness and motivation

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.700
so if you stop masturbation you then

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.560
allow the brain to become sensitive to

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.560
dopamine and serotonin again

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.560
but the science behind masturbation

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.420
shows that it can improve sleep

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.220
reduce stress &amp; pain and improve your immune system

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.220
along with sleuth of other health benefits

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.300
which we covered in another video on masturbation here

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.980
in men it can even reduce prostate cancer risk

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.200
of course these studies investigated primarily the

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.680
experiences of men and currently there is a lack of

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.080
evidence to suggest that polishing the pearl

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.380
is anything but beneficial to women

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.260
so if you wantto stop masturbating for personal reasons

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.260
Go for it

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
some say it helped their lives

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.160
but for most, in moderation

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.920
masturbation is a healthy activity with some genuine

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.220
scientific benefits

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.060
if you want know even more masturbation's healthy effects

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.320
we just uploaded the newest episode of our

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.880
podcast sidenote to youtube for the first time

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.860
where we have a scientific debate about masturbation

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.980
you can click here to list and subscribe to the new channel

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.340
we also tell very candid and personal stories about this

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.280
touchy subject and then debate both sides of the issue

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.840
including a discussion on porn addiction

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.100
things get pretty heated so be sure to check it out
