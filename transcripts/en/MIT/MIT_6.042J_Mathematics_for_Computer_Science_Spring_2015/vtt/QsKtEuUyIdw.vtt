00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.590
PROFESSOR: Now we come to a more
serious application of the fact

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.790
that the GCD is a
linear combination.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.055
We're going to use it to
prove the prime factorization

00:00:09.055 --> 00:00:11.600
theorem-- which we've
talked about earlier.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.500
This is the unique prime
factorization theorem.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.720
So let's begin by looking at a
technical property of primes,

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.540
which is familiar, but we're
going to need to prove it.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.690
If you believe in prime
factorization, then

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.800
this Lemma-- which says
that if p divides a product,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.514
it divides one or the other of
the components of the product--

00:00:36.514 --> 00:00:38.930
that's an immediate consequence
of the prime factorization

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:39.450
theorem.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.824
But we mustn't
prove it that way,

00:00:40.824 --> 00:00:44.670
because we're trying to use this
to prove prime factorization.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.360
So how can I prove, based
on the facts of what

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.300
we know about GCDs,
without appealing

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.250
to prime factorization
that if p is a prime,

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.460
and p divides a
product, then it divides

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.220
one of the components
of the product,

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.860
either the multiplier or
the [? multiplicand? ?] OK,

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.090
well here's how to prove that.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.470
Suppose that p divides ab,
but it doesn't divide a.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.040
Of course it does
divide a, I'm done.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.560
So we may as well assume
that it doesn't divide a.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.311
Now that means that since
the only divisors p are p

00:01:24.311 --> 00:01:28.250
and 1-- the only positive
divisors of p are p and 1--

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.510
that if p doesn't divide
a, the GCD of a and p is 1.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.190
All right, now comes the
linear combination trick.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.990
Given that the GCD
of p and a is 1,

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.430
that means that I have a linear
combination of a and p that's

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.530
equal to 1-- sa plus tp is equal
to 1, for some coefficients, s

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.470
and t.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.360
Cool-- multiply everything
by b on the right.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.190
So that means that sab plus
tpb is equal to 1 times b.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.970
But look at what we have now.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.460
The first term on the
left is something times

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.180
ab, and p divides ab, so that
first term is divisible by p.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.979
The second term
explicitly has a p in it,

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.960
so it's certainly
divisible by p.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.270
So the left hand side
is a linear combination

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.160
of multiples of p,
and therefore, itself

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.710
is a multiple of p--
which means the right hand

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.760
side is a multiple of p, and
the right hand side is b.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.730
So sure enough, p divides b.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.480
We're done-- a very
elegant little proof

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.770
that follows immediately from
the fact that you can express

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.310
the GCD of two numbers
as a linear combination

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.860
of those numbers.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.420
Now this is the
key technical Lemma

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.020
that we need to prove
unique factorization.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.360
A corollary of this that
I'm actually going to need

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.880
is that if p divides a product
of more than two things--

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.200
if p divides a product
of a lot of things--

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.900
it has to divide at
least one of them.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.450
And this you could
prove by induction,

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.750
with the base case being
that it works for m equals 2.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.520
But it's not very
interesting, and we're

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.910
going to take that for granted.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.520
If p divides a
product of any size,

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.830
it divides one of the
components of the product.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.600
All right, now
we're ready to prove

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.650
what's called the fundamental
theorem of arithmetic, which

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.730
says that every integer greater
than one factors uniquely

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.550
into a weakly decreasing
sequence of primes.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.380
Now the statement
of weakly decreasing

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.540
is a little bit
technical and unexpected.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.420
What we want to say is
that a number factors

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.330
into the same set of primes.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.790
Well that's not quite right,
because the set of primes

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.960
doesn't take into account how
many times each prime occurs.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.660
You could try to make a
statement about every number

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.970
uniquely is a multiple
of a certain number

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.620
of each kind of prime.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.730
But a slick way to
do that is simply

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.120
to say, take all the
prime factors, including

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.280
multiple occurrences of
a prime, and line them up

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.650
in weakly decreasing order.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.440
And when you do that,
that sequence is unique.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.180
This fundamental
theorem of arithmetic

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.460
is also called the prime
factorization theorem.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.490
And here's what it
says when we spell it

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:24.080
out-- without using the
words weakly decreasing.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.240
It says that every
integer, n, greater than 1

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.600
has a unique factorization
into primes--

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.770
mainly it can be expressed as
a product of p 1 through p k

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.980
is equal to n.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.660
With p 1 greater
than or equal to p 2,

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.670
greater than or equal
to each successive prime

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.240
in the sequence, with
the smallest one last.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.930
Let's do an example.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.750
So there's a number
that was not chosen

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.250
by accident, because I worked
out what the factorization was.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.200
And it factors into the
following weakly decreasing

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.700
sequence.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.210
You start with the
prime 53, you followed

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.800
by three occurrences of 37,
two 11s, a 7 and three 3s.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.960
And the point is that if you
try to express this ugly number

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.790
as a weakly decreasing
sequence of primes,

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.450
you're always going to get
exactly this sequence-- it's

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.950
the only way to do it.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.890
All right, how are we
going to prove that?

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.690
Well, let's suppose
that it wasn't true.

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.300
Suppose that there was
some number that could be

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.590
factored in two different ways.

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.150
Well, by the
well-ordering principle,

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.200
there's at least one.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.650
So we're talking about numbers
that are greater than 1,

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.490
so there's a least
number greater than 1

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.800
that can be factored
in two different ways.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.630
Supposed that it's n.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:47.412
So what I have is that n is
a product p 1 through p k.

00:05:47.412 --> 00:05:50.190
And it's equal to
another product, q 1

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.250
through q m, where the p's
and the q's are all prime.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.420
And these two weakly decreasing
sequences are not the same.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.540
They differ somehow.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:05.330
So we can assume that the
p's are listed in a weakly

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.185
decreasing order, and the
q's are likewise listed

00:06:08.185 --> 00:06:10.890
in weakly decreasing order.

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:12.460
Now the first
observation-- suppose

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.920
that q 1 is equal to p 1.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.910
Well that's not really possible,
because if q 1 is equal to p 1,

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:24.100
then I could cancel the
p 1 from both sides,

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.140
and I would get
the p 2 through p k

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:31.740
is equal to q 2 through q m, and
these would still be different.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.810
Since they were different,
and I took the same thing

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:39.130
from their beginning, I'm left
with a smaller number that

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.000
does not have unique
factorization, contradicting

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.050
the minimality of n.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:53.160
So in short, it's not
possible for q 1 to equal p 1.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.070
So one of them
has to be greater.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:00.060
We may as well assume that
q 1 is bigger than p 1.

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.830
So q 1 is bigger than p 1, and
p 1 is greater than or equal

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.210
to all the other
p's, so in fact,

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:09.110
q 1 is bigger than
every one of the p's.

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:13.370
Well that's going reach
a contradiction because

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.240
of the corollary.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.780
What I know is
that q 1 divides n,

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.520
and n is a product of the p's.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:26.300
And since q divides the product
of the p's, by the corollary,

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:31.030
it's got to divide one of them--
q 1 must divide p i for some i,

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:34.820
but that contradicts the fact
that q 1 is bigger than p i.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:39.210
That's not possible
for the larger number

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:41.000
to divide the smaller number.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.780
And we're done.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:48.150
And we have proved the
unique factorization theorem.
