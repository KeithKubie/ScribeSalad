00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.060
&gt;&gt; So hello, good afternoon,
my name is Tracy North.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.020
I am a reference librarian
in the Hispanic Division

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.710
and Social Sciences
Editor of the "Handbook

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.400
of Latin American Studies",
an annotated guide

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.920
to scholarly publications
about Latin America

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.210
that has been published since 1936

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.700
and includes quite a few
references to baseball I might add.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.800 position:56%
So, on behalf of the Library of
Congress I am excited to welcome you

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.640
to today's talk by journalist
and author Cesar Brioso

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.980
about his new book "Havana
Hardball: Spring Training,

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.850
Jackie Robinson and
the Cuban League".

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.990
Do you know how many
Cubans are playing

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.410
in Major League Baseball today?

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.420
Do you know who was the first
Cuban to play in the MLB and when?

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.450
Have you heard of New York
Yankees' closer Aroldis Chapman

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.870
who was traded from the Reds
last year and is rumored to be

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.260
on the verge of getting
traded again?

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.250
He had a great night against my
Baltimore Orioles the other night,

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.900
routinely throwing
100-mile-an-hour fastballs.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.460
Today, you will learn about some
of the historical foundations

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.660
of Cuban baseball on the island
with a focus on 1946 and 1947.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.880
You'll learn about the rivalry
between the Almendares and Habana,

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.220
similar to rivalries
between the New York Yankees

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.620
and the Brooklyn Dodgers
of Jackie Robinson's era

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.820
or there is Boca Juniors versus
River Plate in Argentine soccer,

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.830
Barcelona versus Real Madrid
in Spain, Borg versus McEnroe,

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.320
Chrissie versus Martina
in tennis in the 80s.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.060
You get the idea.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.440
As you may know the Library

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.030
of Congress now holds the
Jackie Robinson Papers.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.990 position:56%
Preparing for his major league debut

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.750
with the Brooklyn Dodgers Robinson
participated in spring training

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.800
with the team in Cuba in 1947.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.500
The idea was that he would be able
to avoid the attention of the press

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.790
and unsupportive fans in Florida,

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.880
the team's usual spring
training location.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.770
At that time remember we're talking
about pre-revolutionary Cuba.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.980
Robinson was not the first or only
American in Cuba during that time.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.640
Think Hemingway whose
birthday is today by the way,

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.030
Sinatra, Meyer Lansky et cetera.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.470
These are just some of the topics
that you'll hear more about today

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.740
from Cesar Brioso, a digital
producer for USA Today's sports

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.960
where he served as baseball
editor from 2003 to 2004.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.660
Cesar has been a writer or editor

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.930
at several other papers
including The Miami Herald,

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.180
South Florida Sun Sentinel
and Tampa Tribune.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.110
He's a member of the Society

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.420
for American Baseball Research
that's having their conference

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.990
coming up next week in
Florida and he blogs

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.090
about Cuban baseball
history at cubanbaseball,

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.700
spelled in Spanish, dot.com.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.050
Now I'd like to turn the
program over to Cesar.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.880
&gt;&gt; Thank you, good afternoon.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.820
Thank you all for coming and thank
you to the Library of Congress

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.380
for letting me talk about
my book "Havana Hardball".

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.590
And so broadly, the book
is about baseball in Cuba

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.060
in the mid to late 1940s.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.330
It's a pivotal time in baseball
history when Cuba finds itself

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.420
at the epicenter of
events that are going

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.460
to impact not just the Cuban League
but also other Latin leagues,

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.060
Major League Baseball and the
Negro Leagues for years to come.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.270
I chose to focus on this
particular time period at least

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.410
in part because of my father.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.100
You'll see a photo of him here.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.920
That's him as a kid in Cuba
with one of his uncles.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.730
He, the hat he's wearing
is Almendares, one of the.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.690
That's his favorite team,
one of the four teams

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.530
in the Cuban League at that time.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.850
Like when I was a kid my dad
would tell me all these stories

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.170
about American ball players who
would come to Cuba every winter

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.890
to play baseball and you're
seeing some of the photos up here.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.770
You know familiar names, Tommy
Lasorda who became a Hall

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:20.430
of Fame manager with the
Dodgers, future Hall of Famers

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.690
from the Negro League like
Monte Irvin and Ray Dandridge

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.090
and as you're seeing right
here a guy named Kevin Connors

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.380
who you would be more familiar
with the name Chuck Connors

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.430
from the, Hollywood actor.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.580
He was, before he became
a Hollywood actor

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.660
in "The Rifleman" he was a player
in the Dodgers Farm System.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.400
So I'd hear all these stories
as I was a kid and then as,

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.670
once I became a sports writer
working in Florida I started

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.880 position:56%
to find a lot of these guys
retired and in, throughout the state

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.130
and I would interview them for
stories for the various papers

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.010
that I worked for at the
time and started building,

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.690
collecting all these
interviews with the idea

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.800
of eventually, someday
writing a book.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:08.720
And when I finally got a
publisher, sort of the last stage

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.050
of my research was the Library
of Congress, was very helpful.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.230
They have a great collection of
Cuban newspapers on microfilm.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.690 position:56%
I was able to access those, not just
here but what was really helpful was

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.760
that the Library of Congress was
gracious enough to allow them

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.960 position:56%
to be sent to Fairfax County Library
where I live which made research

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.140
so much easier not having to come
into the District multiple times

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.410
to be able to look
through all those articles.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.250
That's broadly what
the book is about.

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:47.740
Specifically it focuses on the
1946-47 Cuban League season.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.040
That is what is still
considered kind

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.290
of the greatest finish
in league history.

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:56.780
It came down to a three-game series
between Almandares and Habana,

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.530
the eternal rivals
as they were called.

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.830
Both teams had been in the Cuban
League since its formation in 1878,

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.900 position:56%
just two years after the start of
the National League here in the U.S.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.360 position:56%
And as the three games, the decisive
three-game series was being played

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.670
out the Dodgers arrived for
spring training in Havana

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:19.130
and with them came their Triple
AAA Farm Team, the Montreal Royals

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.570
which included not only Jackie
Robinson but also Roy Campanella,

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.660
Don Newcombe and Roy Partlow.

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:30.880
And so the book alternates
between those two storylines

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.770
in alternating chapters and they
play out against the backdrop

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.630
of the Mexican League trying
to get major league players

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.680
to jump their contracts to
play in their summer league.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:50.080
And why that matters
is because they,

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.880 position:56%
them trying to get all these players
to jump, and in fact they got

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.430
like 20-something players
to jump their contracts.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.440
Commissioner Happy Chandler
declared that any player

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.890
who jumped their contracts
would be ineligible

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:04.000
to play Major League Baseball
and organized baseball

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.800
for at least five years, and
even then there was no guarantee

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.510
that they'd be allowed back.

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:11.710 position:56%
And that matters to the Cuban League
because so many players played

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.840 position:56%
in the Cuban League of those jumpers
and Cuban players also played

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:20.570 position:56%
in Mexico or managed or coached in
Mexico so Chandler had also declared

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:21.870
that anyone who played with

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:25.530
or against those jumpers
would also be ineligible

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:27.120
to play in organized baseball.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.800
So in essence the Cuban League
which had enjoyed great relations

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.640
with Major League Baseball and had
players from the majors playing

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:36.940
in Cuba either in the league

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:41.770
or barnstorming really
throughout the 20th century,

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:43.070
they were suddenly a rogue league

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:47.410
and their players were rogue
players, just by playing

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:50.340
in the league were, their careers,

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:55.120
futures in organized
baseball were threatened.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:59.410
So, and the book explores sort
of how all these conflicts came

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:04.090
into being, how they got resolved
and what happens going forward.

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:07.300
So, with that I think
I'll just open it up.

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.510
I'd prefer to have, it be more of a
conversation than me just standing

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:12.910
up here, kind of telling
you about the book

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:14.710
so hopefully you have
some interesting questions

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:16.620 position:56%
and I'll be glad to answer them now.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:17.920
Yes?

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.220
&gt;&gt; Since it was raised
in the introduction,

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:22.770
who was the first Cuban in the
Major League Baseball in America?

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:26.070
&gt;&gt; The very first Cuban in
the majors was Esteban Bellan

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:29.210
with the Detroit Haymakers in, I'm
trying to remember now off the top

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:31.110
of my head, 1870 something.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:35.120
But in terms of the modern era
since 1900 there were a pair

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:39.750
of Cuban players signed by
the Cincinnati Reds in 1911,

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:43.360
Rafael Almeida and Armando Marsans.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:48.990
So they joined in, like I said 1911
and when they were first signed

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:51.340
and were playing in the
minors there was this.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.860
In my research I found
this sort of rushed by,

00:08:53.860 --> 00:09:01.420
newspapers to assure baseball fans
that they were in fact, white,

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:05.310
really kind of amazing words used.

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:09.150
One, I believe the Cincinnati
Enquirer, if I remember correctly,

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:12.660
referred to them as the
two, two purest bars

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:17.130
of Castilian soap ever
sailed to these shores.

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:20.320
And there were all kinds
of, I mean that's kind

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.310
of how they were described.

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:28.210
Multiple newspaper accounts again
assuring white major league fans

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:30.280
that no, they're not black.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:34.830
They're Cuban or they're of
you know European ancestry.

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:39.800
One referred to them as having
no ignoble African blood

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:44.790
so all these references in the 19,
the teens, trying to describe them

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:47.760
and assure fans they weren't black.

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:52.170
Yes? I'm sorry.

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:54.420
&gt;&gt; So what was the
racial situation in Cuba

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.430 position:56%
in that summer that Jackie Robinson?

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.550
Were there any problems there?

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:02.340
&gt;&gt; No, not at all, in fact the
Cuban League had been integrated

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:05.620
since 1900 so they were far ahead

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:08.920
of integration here
in the major leagues.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:13.420
In fact that's one of the
reasons why Branch Rickey chose

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:16.810
to move the Dodgers' spring
training from Daytona Beach.

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:19.100
That's where they trained
in 1946, to Havana.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.400
They had been.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.700
They were familiar with Havana.

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.260
They had trained there
in 1941 and 1942

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:29.000
and in '46 Robinson's first year
with the Royals they had a bunch

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.870
of issues trying to play games.

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:36.290
When the Royals would go to play a
minor league spring training game

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:39.360
they might find that the
stadium was padlocked

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:43.620
or that there was a sudden lighting
malfunction so they couldn't play.

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:49.140 position:56%
In one instance a police officer
informed that there was an ordinance

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:52.760
where black and white players could
not share the same baseball field.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:57.150
So they encountered all
these issues in 1946

00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:02.580
so when Branch Rickey was planning
to make sure that that was the,

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:03.940
in '47, that that was the year

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:07.410
that he would elevate
Robinson to the Dodgers.

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:09.410
That's why he chose
to move to Havana

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:14.130
because of the better
racial climate certainly

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:17.830
in baseball and in society as well.

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:19.130
There were.

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:22.390
It's not to say that there's
no racism or no issues in Cuba

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:24.880
but it certainly was
not the codified racism

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:30.060
that you had here especially
in Florida with Jim Crow laws.

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:34.500
&gt;&gt; The ownership of the Cuban
League teams at that time,

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:40.920 position:56%
was it pretty much all indigenous
ownership or was there any influence

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.760
of American owners or
investors down there?

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.750
&gt;&gt; No, it was pretty
much owned by Cubans.

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:53.250 position:56%
In fact one of the sort of, baseball
legends Miguel Angel Gonzalez,

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:54.550
he played.

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:58.490
He was also one of the early
Cuban players in the majors.

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:02.580
He played in 1920s-30s.

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:07.110
He played with the Cardinals,
Giants, White Sox, several teams.

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:09.990
He was a catcher and
played with Habana most

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:11.290
of his career as a player.

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:14.260
He eventually became manager
of Habana, saved enough money

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.250
to become a part-owner and
eventually owned the entire team.

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:19.330
And that was pretty typical.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.350
It was either individual,
Cuban individuals or a group

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:24.320
of Cubans who owned each team.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:30.290 position:56%
Almendares was owned by a group that
had ties to the Vedado Tennis Club

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:37.300 position:56%
which was a social club for affluent
Cubans so that was pretty typical

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:42.450
of the teams in the Cuban League.

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:43.750
Yes?

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:46.400
&gt;&gt; Would you mind speaking sort
of generally about baseball

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:51.510
in Latin America and then
baseball introduction to Cuba?

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:54.020
How did it go from being this
game that we've all heard

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:57.910
about having its roots in
America and now we're talking

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:00.220
about Latin America and Cuba so?

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:06.990
&gt;&gt; Well, baseball was introduced
in Cuba around, in the 1860s.

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:10.880
Students who, Cuban students who
went to the United States to study

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.930
in college brought the game back
to Cuba in that time period.

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:18.710
It also kind of was helped
spread by the presence

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:21.930
of U.S. military in Cuba.

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:28.190
I've seen dozens of photos of U.S.
Navy teams playing in Guantanamo

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:30.990
in the early part of
the 20th century.

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:34.500 position:56%
So, that's where it was first
introduced and it really became sort

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.380
of engrained in the Cuban
culture with the fight

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:39.510
for independence against Spain.

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:44.500
It became, sort of, one way
of expressing their rejection

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:50.280
of Spanish rule, choosing baseball
over bullfighting for example.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:56.420 position:56%
And it also became engrained as part
of that with the exiled communities

00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:59.410
in Key West, Ybor City in Tampa.

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:03.490
They would form their own social
clubs here in the United States

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:07.250
and they would put on baseball
games and some of the proceeds

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:10.550
from those games would be sent
back to Cuba to fight the,

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:12.720
for the fight for independence.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:18.020
So in the late 1800s it really
started to become entrenched

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:21.700
and be part of Cuban culture,
what it means to be Cuban.

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.610
And then Cuba really
became sort of the apostles

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:27.270
of baseball throughout
the Caribbean,

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:31.500
spreading it to other countries.

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:36.110 position:56%
There were some people who left
Cuba to, you know because of the war

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:39.130
to places like Mexico and the
Dominican Republic for safety

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:42.560
and kind of brought the game
there with them then and it built

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.360
up through that, that way.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:49.780
&gt;&gt; Can you take that one step
further to then integrating

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:51.400
into Major League Baseball
in the U.S.?

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:56.370
I guess it was Cubans a lot first
and then when that ended other,

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:59.230
players from other countries
started to come more?

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:03.630
&gt;&gt; Right, before the Castro
revolution Cuba had the largest

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:07.330
number of players born
outside the United States

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:08.630
that were in the majors.

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:11.250
I don't have the exact
number off the top of my head

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:16.610
but they were pretty much the main
producer of major league talent

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:19.490
in the, from Latin America.

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:23.200
And then once the Castro
revolution took over

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:27.920
and eventually professional
baseball was eliminated there

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:31.460
and ties were cut off so that
players couldn't come here,

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:33.920
that's when you started
to see the growth

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:38.590 position:56%
in other Latin American countries,
specifically the Dominican Republic,

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:40.410
Venezuela and then Puerto Rico.

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:44.170
Today, the Dominican
is the largest producer

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:49.740
of major league talent followed
by Venezuela and then Puerto Rico.

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:52.830
When they do there, even though,
yes, they're U.S. citizens,

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:57.060
when Major League Baseball
does their sort of count their,

00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:59.200
run their numbers they refer to it

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:03.250
as 'born outside the
50 United States'.

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:10.660
So that's how Puerto Rico gets
put into that list, again,

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:14.200
Latin America, much larger than the
Asian countries although they're

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.870
increasing now as well.

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:22.360
&gt;&gt; You said there were five
teams in the Cuban League and?

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.590
&gt;&gt; Four teams.

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:26.720
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] yes,
Cienfuegos, Marianao.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.020
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:32.340
&gt;&gt; Almendares' home field is
also in the greater Havana area?

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:35.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah, they used to,
earlier in the existence

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.490
of the Cuban League they had
sort of their own ballparks.

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:41.510
There was an Almendares Park.

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:43.450
There were Cienfuegos.

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:47.970
Matanzas had a park but then in
1933 and there's a photo here,

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:54.890
the La Tropical Stadium was
built for the Pan-American Games.

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:57.450
There's an aerial shot and
you'll see that there's actually

00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:01.000
like a track intersecting
the baseball field.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.250
So it was used for not only
baseball but track and field,

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:09.180
soccer and that's, and all the
four teams at that point played

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:10.650
in that one location,

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:14.640
in the Marianao area just
outside the heart of the city.

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:20.760
And then in 1946 right before
the season that my book focuses

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:26.370
on Bobby Maduro and his company
built El Gran Stadium in,

00:17:26.370 --> 00:17:28.360
closer to the heart of the city.

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:32.560
Again, all four teams moved
to that area and it was

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:37.250 position:56%
because the La Tropical while it
was supposedly this really wonderful

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:39.270
site because it was associated.

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:40.570
That's it right there.

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:42.710 position:56%
It was associated with the breweries
so there were beer gardens,

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:45.560
dancehalls and all
these other activities

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.350
but it really wasn't
great for baseball.

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:51.040
So then they moved
to El Gran Stadium

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.390
and you can see a much
more traditional setup

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:57.000
for baseball, more capacity.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.580 position:56%
It could hold 34,000 when it opened.

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:03.190
There were lights added
to El Gran Stadium

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:05.230
which La Tropical did not have.

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:10.300
So because it, not only was the
economy booming post World War 11

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:15.060
but the old stadium simply really
couldn't hold the interest,

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:17.840
all the fans that were interested
and so the season that I talked

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:23.020
about is the inauguration of
that sort of more modern stadium.

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:25.230
&gt;&gt; Do teams still play
at El Gran Stadium?

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:26.530
&gt;&gt; They do.

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:28.420
If you saw where the Rays went

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:30.910
to play the Cuban National
Team and that's been.

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:32.240
That's El Gran Stadium.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:37.220
It's called Estadio Latinoamericano
and it looks very similar.

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:41.590
The main change is that now
that there's a. I think you saw

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:44.240
in the aerial shot there were
no seats in the outfield.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.540
Now they have.

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:49.310
They have grandstands and
bleachers in that area

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:50.840
so the capacity is much larger.

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:56.470
You know I believe that for that
game Major League Baseball helped

00:18:56.470 --> 00:19:00.920
to sort of do not necessarily
renovations but maybe just upkeep.

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:06.500
Like much of Cuba's infrastructure
stuff had started to deteriorate

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:09.610
so they did, from my understanding,
did quite a bit to get it

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:12.810
up to standard for that game.

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:14.110
Yes?

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:15.410
&gt;&gt; You mentioned a
conflict with the,

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:19.770
because of the Mexican Leagues
sort of created problems

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:21.900
for Major League Baseball.

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:26.730
What brought about I guess
the big [inaudible] allow Cuba

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:31.530 position:56%
to become part of the minor leagues?

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:32.830
&gt;&gt; Yeah, like the.

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:34.130
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] after that.

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:35.550
&gt;&gt; Like one of the
things that happened,

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:39.470
there was actually an organized
baseball sanctioned Cuban League

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:43.200
that was running parallel to the
traditional one where players

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.410
who were afraid about
their future went to play.

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:47.710
But there were two attempts.

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:49.010
There was one attempt like that

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:54.430 position:56%
and it just did not have the
popular support of fans and it ended

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:58.160
up finishing prematurely
that season in '46, '47.

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:02.400
And then eventually,
basically a delegation

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:10.080
from the Cuban League went and met
with organized baseball to come

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:14.040
up with an agreement to sort
of let the Cuban League back

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:18.800
into good graces but bring
them under the umbrella

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:22.110
of organized baseball
because of the fact that all

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:24.800
of these players suddenly didn't
have a career in the majors,

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:28.120 position:56%
in organized baseball anymore, so
they were able to work a negotiated.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:33.190
They negotiated a system
where, but now codified sort

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:35.620
of how the league would
be populated with players

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.800
from Major League Baseball,
what numbers,

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:41.470
what pool of players
they could pick from.

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:46.340
Previously to that, each Cuban
team just kind of signed players

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:47.960
who they had contacts with.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:52.110
I mentioned Miguel Angel
Gonzalez, he was a coach with the,

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:54.520
a third-base coach for the
Cardinals for many years.

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:57.300
In fact he was in the
third-base coaching box

00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:03.080
in the 1946 World Series for
Enos Slaughter's mad dash home.

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:05.440
But like Adolfo Luque
who was the manager

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:11.230
for Almendares he was a pitching
coach with the Giants at the time.

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:13.960
He recruited Sal Maglie
to come and play for him

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:17.300
when he was managing
Cienfuegos in the '45, '46 season

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:20.570
and that's how they kind of just
through their contacts in baseball,

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:23.440
that's how they signed players.

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:27.050
But moving forward after
the conflict with the,

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:31.770
because of the Mexican League
raids they set up a codified system

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:34.570
of how they would actually
be able to use players

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:36.360
from organized baseball
going forward.

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:37.660
&gt;&gt; But then there was also

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:40.270
like a Triple AAA team
in Havana in the 50s?

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:45.450
&gt;&gt; Right. It actually began as a
B-League team, the Havana Cubans

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:50.180
in 1946 and then Bobby Maduro who.

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:55.610
He built the stadium as well not
just to modernize the Cuban League

00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:57.880
but also with an eye toward
eventually having a major league

00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.250
team in Havana.

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:05.880
And he bought the Cubans
and in 1954 they then moved

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:10.890
to the internationally AAA
as the Havana Sugar Kings

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:13.520
and they were affiliated
with the Reds.

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:16.100
So by that point it was actually a,

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:19.250
you know that minor league
team operated separately

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:24.690
from the Cuban Winter League
but, you know that was.

00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:26.630
They were affiliated
with the Reds like I said

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:29.460
but like the Cuban League was
brought into organized baseball

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:32.590
as an unaffiliated minor league
so they weren't you know,

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:35.880
in Triple AAA, Double
AA or what have you.

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:41.530
&gt;&gt; What can you tell us about
that picture of the Dodgers

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:44.010
with Hemingway and all [inaudible]?

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:48.620
&gt;&gt; Well, it's in the book during
the '41 and '42 seasons when,

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:51.580
before the Dodgers would train
there, spring training I mean.

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:57.040
You know Hemingway was
living in Havana at the time.

00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:02.060 position:56%
He had a ranch about 10 miles
outside of the city and he would run

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:05.380
into the players not just at
the ballparks but at the casinos

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:09.570
and nightclubs and invited a
group of them back to his farm

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:17.290
and I don't want to give everything
away but it involved quite a bit

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:26.070
of drinking, fisticuffs and
the challenge to a duel so.

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:27.660
John, did you have a question?

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:29.180
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was wondering

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:32.450
if the Cuban League had
any international play

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:36.050
with other Latin American
countries on a regular basis?

00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:37.790
&gt;&gt; No, not specifically.

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:40.480
There were Cuban players
who would go and play

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:44.300
in Venezuela or the Dominican.

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:48.440
In certain years, certainly also
players from those countries came

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:52.660
and played in the Cuban League.

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:56.580
During the time when the Cuban
League was an outlaw league,

00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:00.440
there were discussions about
maybe creating some sort

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:05.600
of Latin American League, where
they would play against teams

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.230 position:56%
from other Latin American countries.

00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:09.270
It never really got off the ground.

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:13.150
It was more or less just trying to
figure out what are we going to do

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:17.980
if we're not, you know, if we're
still sort of this rogue league?

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:24.070
But no, there were never really
sort of organized games other

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:25.880
than maybe exhibition games.

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.180
Yes?

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:32.890
&gt;&gt; This, this obviously
is outside the purview

00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:35.500
of the title of your book.

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:38.640
Could you maybe talk a
little bit about how baseball

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:41.850
in Cuba changed after
the revolution?

00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:46.570
I think, I mean we obviously had
a lot of American influence prior

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:47.870
to the revolution but we do know

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:51.180
that baseball has survived
in Cuba [inaudible].

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:55.270
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it survived and
even thrived on some levels.

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:58.480
One of the major changes
obviously the major change is,

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.220
no professionalism.

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:07.590
It became state-run just like
all the businesses and, but,

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:09.890
for instance in this
era where all the teams,

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:13.620 position:56%
the four teams even though they may
have by name represented other parts

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:17.570
of the country, they all played
all their games in Havana.

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:22.030
And what they did post-revolution
was they spread the league out,

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:23.700
throughout the country.

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:26.940
And in fact there were
rules that you had to live.

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:31.060
You had to be from that province
to play on that province's team.

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:33.790
And so that's, it's
called the Serie Nacional,

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:38.860
the National Series is what
it is now and that league was,

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:41.500
with the pool of players
that they would use

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:43.570
to fill the Cuban national team.

00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:48.360
And obviously for international
amateur competitions they were the

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:52.190
dominant force for decades
whether it was Olympics,

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:58.620
their version of a World Cup
played throughout the country,

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:00.780
throughout the world.

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:02.420
They were the team to beat.

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:06.150
That has not necessarily
been the case in recent years

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:09.790
because they have haemorrhaged so
much talent through defections,

00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:11.340
particularly the last,
maybe ten years

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:18.090 position:56%
or so they have seen a huge spike in
defections and you see the results

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:21.350
of that with the players that
are coming to the major leagues

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:26.230
and making an immediate impact,
you know, whether it's [inaudible]

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:31.530 position:56%
or Horayu [phonetic] or [inaudible],
Chapman who was mentioned earlier.

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:38.120
And there's a player on the Red
Sox system, Moncada who is supposed

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:42.340
to be just a star and
he's in his early 20s.

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:46.200
So now that [inaudible] it's
not necessarily the case

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:50.510
that they're just going to be
the automatic winner and I think

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:55.250
that that at least in part is
what has kind of helped drive the,

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:58.790
at least on the baseball
side, the connections

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:02.430
that are being made right now with
Cuba and Major League Baseball.

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:06.330 position:56%
The Cuban government I'm sure wants
to, if there is going to be a future

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:09.970 position:56%
where Cuban players can come to the
majors, they want it to be some kind

00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:13.940
of a system where they can maintain
some control over their players

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:16.770
so that they're not all defecting.

00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:18.850
&gt;&gt; Could you talk a
little bit about Dihigo,

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:22.810
the guy who is in three
Halls of Fame?

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:25.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah, Martin Dihigo,
there are photos of him here.

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:30.230
He played in the Negro
Leagues in the 1920s.

00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:33.850
Many consider him to be maybe
the greatest all-around player,

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:37.010
certainly in Cuba maybe anywhere.

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:40.570 position:56%
He played practically every
position and he was a great pitcher.

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:42.030
He was a great hitter.

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:45.800
But because he was
black he never played

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:48.040
in the majors but that didn't.

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:53.170
He was elected to the Hall of Fame
by the Veterans Committee along

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:57.240
with many other Negro
Leaguers during the 1970s.

00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:02.260
And he was a manager
in Cuba as well.

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:06.750
He managed also in other
Latin American countries

00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:13.470 position:56%
and as you mentioned, in the Hall of
Fame in the U.S., Cuba and Mexico,

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:17.500
a terrific player but never got
the chance to show that here other

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:20.050
than playing for Negro
League teams or barnstorming

00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:23.700
with Negro League teams
in the United States.

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:29.440
And he's a contemporary of Adolfo
Luque and Miguel Angel Gonzalez,

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:32.720 position:56%
you know, but because they were
white they could play in the majors.

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:42.260
&gt;&gt; Can you talk a little bit
about the experience of attending,

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:46.380
of being a fan in the 40s in Cuba?

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:48.450
Were there tickets
that you had to buy?

00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:49.750
What were the prices?

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:51.050
Did they sell popcorn?

00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:52.880
I'm sure they didn't
but like what was the?

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:55.490
Did you dress up because I
think it used to be more formal?

00:28:55.490 --> 00:29:02.270
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a, "Life" magazine
did a. I found pictures from 1951

00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:06.140
and everybody, they did a
huge spread, multiple photos

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:12.100
and you see everybody in suits
and ties and their best dresses

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:15.530
which I find amazing considering
what the temperature must have been

00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:16.830
even though it was.

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:19.080
Even though it was
January and February

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:23.130
in Cuba it was very festive.

00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:26.800
There were bands or at
least groups of people

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:29.420
with instruments in the stands.

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:31.830
You would see there are
[inaudible] images of guys walking

00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:34.800
around with these giant
lottery billboards

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:37.370
that they would sell there.

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:42.720
People would place bets on the
first homerun, the first hit.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:48.670
So it's a fairly festive atmosphere

00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:53.530
and in all the readings I've done
The Sporting News did a great job

00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:56.690 position:56%
covering the Cuban League back then.

00:29:56.690 --> 00:30:00.020
And it was unlike any
atmosphere that they had,

00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:02.040
that those writers had seen
in Major League Baseball.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.340
Yes?

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:10.220
&gt;&gt; Will Oscar [inaudible]
as well but I've heard,

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:15.340
I think there are rumors that,
obviously I think Fidel Castro,

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:19.870
he's confirmed he's a big baseball
fan but I've heard some things

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:23.960
about he was actually
a prospect at one time?

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:27.120
&gt;&gt; Largely urban myth [laughter].

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:29.110
&gt;&gt; I heard that too [laughter].

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:32.060
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's the kind of
thing that started and sort

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:35.260
of subsequent writers just
picked up on and it just kind

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:38.440
of kept growing but they're.

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:41.950
He played I believe
volleyball and basketball

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:43.760
at the University of Havana.

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:48.930
One author, Roberto Gonzalez
Echevarria, he wrote a great book,

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:55.570
sort of the entire scope of Cuban
baseball history called "Pride

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:58.990
of Havana" and he actively
sought out box scores trying

00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:01.840
to find evidence of a
Fidel Castro and only found

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:05.540
that one, F. Castro, pitching.

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:11.860
I'm presently working on, sort
of the next book which is the end

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:14.790
of professional baseball and
where I've seen the references,

00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:19.040
apparently start is with
Joe Cambria who was a scout

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:22.510
for the Washington Senators and
signed something on the order

00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:27.110
of 300 players from Cuba
throughout the 30s, 40s and 50s

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:31.490
and he's the one who sort of
said that Castro was a prospect

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:33.210
and you know that if
he had been able

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:35.910
to sign him maybe things
would have been different.

00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:38.360
And then some other writers
just picked up on it.

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:43.120
It became almost a fact
but there's no evidence.

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:47.380
And I don't know if you're
familiar with the name Ralph Avila.

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:51.290
He was the guy kind of
running the Dodgers' academies

00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:55.660
in the Dominican Republic and he,
I spoke to him several months ago

00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:57.090 position:56%
and he was just adamant that that's.

00:31:57.090 --> 00:32:00.150
There's just no truth to
that and he was apparently

00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:05.220
with Castro before the revolution,
you know, while it was happening,

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:08.460
for a time before being
against the revolution,

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:12.240
once he saw what it was
actually going to be.

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:16.950
So, yeah, my guess is that maybe
Cambria kind of said that in a way

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:21.560
of maybe ingratiating himself
with Castro because he wanted to,

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:25.360 position:56%
I think at that point, at that time,
the relationships were starting

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:28.480 position:56%
to deteriorate between the U.S and
Cuba and I'm sure he was just hoping

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:32.280
to be able to keep signing talent
on the cheap in Cuba going forward

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:35.920
and maybe that's why he
sort of made him sound

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:40.020
like a better baseball
player than he was or even.

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:41.320
Anyone else?

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:45.670
&gt;&gt; I have like 5 million.

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:48.200
&gt;&gt; Sure [laughter], we have time.

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:52.300
&gt;&gt; If you talk a little bit
more about Jackie Robinson.

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:56.850
I don't know if he's ever talked
about his experience in Cuba.

00:32:56.850 --> 00:32:59.180
Was he just there that one time?

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:02.030
What, you kind of allude
to, it changes things.

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:04.780
Everything changes after that
so, if you could talk about?

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:08.770
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean that was the
only time that he played there,

00:33:08.770 --> 00:33:12.470
that spring training
and as I said it was

00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:17.410
because Rickey wanted the more
tolerant social climate in Havana

00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:21.140
as the sort of staging ground
for his elevation to the majors.

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:24.810
But it was not at all guaranteed
that he was going to make it

00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:28.470
to the majors that
season and he had the.

00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:30.530
And in some of the slides
it kind of alludes to it,

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:31.830
he had to deal with several issues.

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:33.470
He had. He was changing position.

00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:36.490 position:56%
For the second time actually, he was
a shortstop in the Negro Leagues.

00:33:36.490 --> 00:33:40.200
He played second base with the
Royals in the International League

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.820
and was the league's MVP in '46

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:46.860
and suddenly was handed
a first baseman's mitt

00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:50.870
and because the Dodgers'
infield was essentially stacked.

00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:53.640
That was the only spot that
potentially he could break

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.680
into so he had to deal with that.

00:33:56.680 --> 00:34:01.920
There was, even though
Cuba was chosen

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:05.380
for the better racial
climate he still had to deal

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:07.440
with separate accommodations.

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:11.250
The Dodgers were at the Hotel
Nacional which is a landmark,

00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:15.460
this opulent hotel and the
Montreal Royals trained

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:19.370 position:56%
at the Havana Military Academy about
10 or 15 miles outside the city.

00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:21.950
It's not at all unusual for a minor
league and a major league team

00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:24.380
to have different accommodations,
it still happens today.

00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:28.220
But in addition to that, Robinson

00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:33.450
and the other three black players
were housed in a pretty seedy hotel

00:34:33.450 --> 00:34:35.780
in Old Havana so they
were even separate

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:40.710
from their Montreal teammates
probably out of Rickey,

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:44.890
an abundance of caution
although kind of unnecessary.

00:34:44.890 --> 00:34:48.060
Robinson had played a
year with the Royals.

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:50.990 position:56%
There were no issues with teammates.

00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:54.330
Whatever issues they encountered
were when they played other teams.

00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:59.870
As I said he was the International
League MVP so it was an odd choice

00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:05.100
and it, and Robinson
was not happy about it.

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:08.300
There was also, he
had an injury late,

00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:11.090
a minor injury late
in spring training.

00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:14.560
Leo Durocher largely was
absent during spring training

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:20.210
because he was dealing with
multiple issues including his sort

00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:22.690
of scandalous marriage
to actress Laraine Day.

00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:29.800
But also there was, he had
been admonished by Chandler

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:35.130
to disassociate himself from
gamblers which he had done in Cuba

00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:40.390
but he and Rickey raised a stink
when there were gamblers seen

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:43.500
in the Yankees President's
Box at Gran Stadium.

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:49.310
And there were hearings with
Chandler during spring training

00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:52.560
so Robinson, so Durocher
hardly ever got

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:56.530
to see Robinson during
spring training.

00:35:56.530 --> 00:35:59.460
So there were quite a few
things that, quite a few issues

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:01.230
that Robinson had to
deal with not the least

00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:04.680 position:56%
of which was the petition started by
a group of Dodgers' players to try

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:08.200
and prevent him from actually
making it to the majors.

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:11.900
And all that boiled over
on a side trip to Panama

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:15.060
which is explained in the book.

00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:16.360
Yes?

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:23.320
&gt;&gt; One picture [inaudible] is just
opposite Satchel Paige who's got a

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:27.580
legendary reputation in
baseball everywhere [inaudible].

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:28.880
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:31.030
&gt;&gt; Any particular stories that come

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:33.700
out about him being,
playing in Cuba?

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:37.530
&gt;&gt; Yeah, he played for Santa Clara
which was one of the earlier teams

00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:40.750
in the Cuban League and I don't
want to give the whole thing away

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:43.000
but yes, there was an issue
where he essentially had

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.710
to get out of Cuba because he.

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:47.400
There are sort of conflicting
stories.

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.700
What it was.

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:51.810
&gt;&gt; It didn't involve
Hemingway did it?

00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:55.880
&gt;&gt; That, those didn't involve
Hemingway but it was either

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:59.920
because he didn't understand,
like the, whatever the mayor

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:03.840
of that particular city was upset
with one of his performances

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:06.370
and asked him if he
had basically thrown it

00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:10.130
and him not understanding Spanish,
sort of nodded and just smiled

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:14.000
which enraged the mayor or
it was supposedly because he,

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.700
of a relationship with
a woman there.

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:20.260
A lot of conflicting stories,
they're all sort of explained

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:24.200
and you can try and figure out
which one is the actual truth but.

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:26.180
&gt;&gt; And Josh Gibson?

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:27.480
&gt;&gt; Ah Josh.

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:28.780
&gt;&gt; Could you give a little?

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:32.720
&gt;&gt; Sure, he also played for Santa
Clara for a couple of seasons

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:36.690
and he led the league in homeruns.

00:37:36.690 --> 00:37:40.290
Not surprisingly down there,
you know, shorter season,

00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:43.150
I think it was something like
eight homeruns or whatever but well

00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:45.360
over a 300 batting average.

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:49.400
You know, that was a very common
thing for Negro League players

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:55.430
to play down there whether it was
barnstorming during the winter

00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:58.550
or playing with Cuban League
teams and that was something

00:37:58.550 --> 00:38:01.900
that was going on again
since like 1900.

00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:04.790
Every year there would be
teams that came through.

00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:08.600
It became known as the American
Series whether it was Negro League

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:14.070
teams barnstorming there or
major league teams or a semblance

00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:16.490
of major league teams,
All-Star teams barnstorming

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:19.420
and then the spring
training games as well.

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:20.720
Yeah?

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:28.180
&gt;&gt; Are there any sort of
unique baseball traditions

00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:29.890
in Cuba back then?

00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:31.740
I mean we have the
seventh-inning stretch.

00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:34.880
We have, you know, rally
caps, things like that.

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:40.240
Is there anything that you need to,
the Cuban history any other things?

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:44.160
&gt;&gt; Well, maybe just the atmosphere,
just the sort of open betting

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:48.840
on everything from first
homerun to first hit or whatever.

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:52.250 position:56%
That was certainly a big deal there.

00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:58.340
There were also like awards handed,
like money awards to the players,

00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:00.420
like if somebody got a no-hitter.

00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:05.580
Bohemia magazine would pay out,
you know $1000 or whatever it was

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:08.620
or $500 so there were
those types of things,

00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:12.650
were like a big accomplishment
would actually get,

00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:17.360
be a. There would be a cash reward
for the player from a magazine

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:20.040
or whoever happened to be
sponsoring that sort of thing.

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.340
Yes?

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:30.110
&gt;&gt; Were the players down there
able to play professionally

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:34.120
and not have another job or did
they have to work during the season

00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:35.840
or work in the off-season?

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:38.200
&gt;&gt; Well, a lot of them
would play in the majors

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:41.040
or in Minor League Baseball in
the summer or they'd go to play

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:44.390
in Mexico in the summer
and then be playing

00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:46.780
in their homeland during
winter ball.

00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:49.580
So they kind of were able
to play baseball year round

00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:53.630 position:56%
and that was also why they were
able to get American players to come

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:58.710
down there, you know, because if
you weren't a star player once the

00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:01.620
baseball season ended you kind
of needed to get a job, you know,

00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:03.900
whether it was working at
the local hardware store

00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:06.120
or whatever for the winter.

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:09.310
So, if they had the
opportunity to go down to Cuba

00:40:09.310 --> 00:40:11.990
or Dominican Republic or
Puerto Rico and play baseball

00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:14.550
and earn money they
didn't have to go

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:16.140
and get a real job
during those times so.

00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:20.770 position:56%
But yeah, the Cuban players were
probably playing baseball year round

00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:24.290
whether in the minors,
other Latin countries

00:40:24.290 --> 00:40:27.230
or in Major League Baseball.

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:28.990
There was another question?

00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:32.990 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I was just wondering if any of
the players that visited Cuba stayed

00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:34.400
or returned and settled down.

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:35.940
Are there any stories like that?

00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:41.150
&gt;&gt; I'm trying to think if
anything along those lines.

00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:42.540
I've read stories about
some players,

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:46.290
some of the Negro League
players staying in Mexico.

00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:50.160
I don't recall any
American players sort

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:53.300
of staying beyond just the winter.

00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:56.000
Again a lot of them had
their lives and careers here.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:01.080
They were in the majors but they
all seemed to, reading quotes

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:02.450
and the people I've
talked to all seemed

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:04.820
to really enjoy their
time down there.

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:08.290 position:56%
Because it was, they were well paid.

00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:10.370
They played baseball and they
didn't have to play every day.

00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:14.010
They would play games maybe three,
maybe four days a week so they had

00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:20.160 position:56%
down time where they could go to the
nightclubs or hang out on the beach.

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:25.620
&gt;&gt; What were the comparative
economics

00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:28.620
of U.S. baseball versus
Cuban baseball?

00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:29.920
I mean was it, was there?

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:33.100
I mean there's obviously,
you know, you can't even,

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:35.020
you know, compare it to today.

00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:36.320
It was different here.

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:37.960
&gt;&gt; Right, right.

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:39.260
&gt;&gt; But.

00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:41.430
&gt;&gt; I mean I've heard, read
stories and heard from people

00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:45.940
that they would make more money
a month playing baseball in Cuba

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:48.700
than they were getting paid a
month playing in the majors.

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:54.800
So from that standpoint it was
certainly a good thing for them.

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:58.320
I believe at that time it was a one
to one ratio in terms of dollars

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:04.940
and pesos so it translated
really well obviously.

00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:07.490
So yeah it was, economically
it was a good thing

00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:08.950
for the players to come down there.

00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:12.980
&gt;&gt; Was it viewed?

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:17.510
Was winter ball in Cuba
viewed as a good time

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:19.680
for the major league
baseball players?

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:21.700
Is that one of the reasons why?

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:23.000
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.840
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we were just kind of
saying women and rum and gambling

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:27.670
and baseball three
or four days a week.

00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:31.010
&gt;&gt; All of the above [laughter].

00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:34.080
I mean yeah, this was the nightlife

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:38.500
where there was nightclubs,
casinos was a big draw.

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:45.000
Cuba really became sort of the, a
playground for American tourists

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000
and baseball players
were part of that.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.010
I mentioned the Hotel Nacional.

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:55.290
When it opened you know the guest
list are movie stars and boxers

00:42:55.290 --> 00:43:01.970
and from the United States, so yes
and this particular time period

00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:06.900
in the late 1940s the
mob is just starting

00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:08.330
to get entrenched down there.

00:43:08.330 --> 00:43:12.950
In fact, right before the Dodgers
went to stay at the Hotel Nacional

00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:15.200
for the 1947 spring training,

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:18.930 position:56%
a couple weeks before there had been
a, for lack of a better description,

00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:23.010 position:56%
a mob convention led by Meyer Lansky
where they were trying to plot

00:43:23.010 --> 00:43:27.850
out how they were going
to divvy up the casinos.

00:43:27.850 --> 00:43:32.150
They all had interests in various
casinos and hotels and nightclubs

00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:36.480
to make it essentially the
Las Vegas of the Caribbean,

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:41.110
away from the prying eyes
of U.S. law enforcement.

00:43:41.110 --> 00:43:42.410
Yes?

00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:45.100
&gt;&gt; I guess.

00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:49.880
There was also going on
a lot of people would,

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:51.760
a lot of Americans would
be [inaudible] Key West,

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:56.510
hop on the ferry and do their
honeymoon in Havana and Cuba.

00:43:56.510 --> 00:44:01.050
Was there a, during this winter,
were there a lot of Americans going

00:44:01.050 --> 00:44:07.350 position:56%
to Cuban winter ball as, you know,
fans down there or was it, you know,

00:44:07.350 --> 00:44:12.610
was it primarily a Cuban fan
base and that's what you did.

00:44:12.610 --> 00:44:14.290
Were the Americans
staying in the casinos?

00:44:14.290 --> 00:44:18.620
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I suspect there was
probably mostly a Cuban fan base.

00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:19.920
You mentioned the ferries.

00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:22.410
I know the players
would do exactly that.

00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:25.270
They'd get, go down to Florida,
take the ferry and their car

00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:27.640
on the ferry, to come to
Havana to play in the winter.

00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:32.280
But I suspect that the large
percentage of the fans going

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:35.950
to these games were Cuban fans.

00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:38.570
Anybody else?

00:44:38.570 --> 00:44:43.380
Tracy, any more questions
[laughter]?

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:44.680
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible].

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:51.810
Can you talk a little bit more
about your next project you started

00:44:51.810 --> 00:44:58.890
to talk about, to tell us about?

00:44:58.890 --> 00:45:01.450
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've already
started interviewing.

00:45:01.450 --> 00:45:03.820
I've clocked about a
dozen interviews so far

00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:07.930 position:56%
and I'm gathering newspaper
articles, trying to focus on the end

00:45:07.930 --> 00:45:13.630
of professional baseball in Cuba,
essentially sort of 1958 to 1961,

00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:17.110
what happened with the Cuban
League and the Sugar Kings at the,

00:45:17.110 --> 00:45:20.610
you know, as the revolution
was building and then

00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:23.970
in the immediate aftermath
of the revolution.

00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:32.190
How the league ended, you know,
the last season was 1960-61

00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:37.780
for the Cuban League and it was
an all-Cuban for the first time,

00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:41.450
certainly in the 20th
century, an all-Cuban League

00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:43.580
because U.S. players
were not allowed

00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:46.600
at that point to come and play.

00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:52.150
And the Sugar Kings had to leave
mid-season in 1960 to Jersey City

00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:55.030
and it was abrupt enough
that when they debuted

00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:57.870
in Jersey City they still had
their Sugar Kings uniforms

00:45:57.870 --> 00:46:01.890
on with a patch stitched on across
the chest that said Jersey City.

00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:06.210
It was in July when they moved,

00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:09.820
when essentially the International
League revoked the franchise

00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:11.120
and they had to relocate.

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:24.970
&gt;&gt; I feel like it's unfair
to put you on the spot

00:46:24.970 --> 00:46:28.660
but what does happen now with the
thawing of relations between U.S.

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:30.600
and Cuba, will we see more players?

00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:33.210
Will there be a professional
league again?

00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:39.290
Or right now I guess the only
institutionalized baseball is

00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:41.710
through the national team?

00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:44.040
&gt;&gt; Right. Well, I think
we're going to see some sort

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:45.460
of system in place eventually.

00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:48.270
How long that will
take I don't know.

00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:52.630
I can tell you that there's
a group here, people who used

00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:57.770 position:56%
to be associated with the
Pawtucket Red Sox who own the rights

00:46:57.770 --> 00:47:03.120
to a future minor league team in
Havana should there ever be one.

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:07.670
They've been working to build
relationships with the people

00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:11.840
in Cuba, the officials
there, you know,

00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:14.340
but right now they're just kind of.

00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:18.890
They're just building relationships
in case there is an opportunity.

00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:25.540
How exactly that would play out
given the economics of the country,

00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:31.150
given the embargo still being in
place, yet to be seen I suspect

00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:35.550 position:56%
as far as Cuban players playing in
the majors and not having to defect,

00:47:35.550 --> 00:47:37.550
I think we will see something.

00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:41.000 position:56%
Maybe it will be a system similar to
what we see with the Japanese League

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:45.270
where a major league team will
essentially bid for the right

00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:48.030
to negotiate with a player,
whatever pool of players

00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:51.840
that they make available and then

00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:55.290
if they negotiate a
contract I suspect part

00:47:55.290 --> 00:47:57.990
of that money will go back
to the Cuban government

00:47:57.990 --> 00:48:02.000
and they will have some sort
of control over his services.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:07.750
Cuba had already started sort of
allowing veteran players to play

00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:12.390
in Japan after, you know sort
of as a reward for playing,

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:16.460
for a distinguished career and not
defecting [laughter] from Cuba.

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:22.020
So, but usually they've
been late in their careers

00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:24.770
and have not necessarily
had the kind of impact

00:48:24.770 --> 00:48:27.140
that certainly Major League
Baseball would be looking

00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:31.190
for so yes, I think it will happen.

00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:34.020
I think there might still be a
ways away although the one thing

00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:37.790
that made me think it might happen
quicker was the goodwill tour

00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:41.270
that baseball took in
December I think it was

00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:42.980
where they went to Cuba.

00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:46.100 position:56%
And but what they brought with them,
they brought defectors with them,

00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:50.800
Yasuo Fujii was there and at the
time I just found that stunning.

00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:55.700 position:56%
These are players that were declared
traitors because they left Cuba

00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:57.000
and suddenly they were able

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:01.730
to travel back there freely
with this goodwill tour.

00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:05.200
You know and the Cuban
government, I mean if they wanted.

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:07.820
If they want to save baseball in
Cuba they need to do something

00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:11.250
to stop the defections or
have more control over this

00:49:11.250 --> 00:49:15.080
because that's what's been
hurting baseball there.

00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:16.690
And if they can come
up with a system

00:49:16.690 --> 00:49:20.430
where they can control
the players or which,

00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:23.170 position:56%
and I would imagine there would have
to be some sort of a restriction

00:49:23.170 --> 00:49:25.600
on anybody who defects
actually playing then.

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:27.470
I don't know how that
would work out either so,

00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:31.230
there's a lot of questions but I
do think that it's just a matter

00:49:31.230 --> 00:49:33.530
of time before we do see it.

00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:37.760
&gt;&gt; I think it's important to note
also that there are Cuban defectors

00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:40.180
in the minor leagues in the U.S.

00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:41.480
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:43.540
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] all over the world.

00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:47.040
&gt;&gt; Yeah and that's the thing
is that not all of them,

00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:49.450
a vast majority just
like which is the case

00:49:49.450 --> 00:49:53.120 position:56%
for not just American minor leaguers
but Dominican minor leaguers.

00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:56.270
It's a tiny fraction of the
folks that are in the minors

00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:58.240 position:56%
that actually make it to the majors.

00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:03.910
So for yeah, for every Yasuo
Fujii, there's dozens if not more

00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:08.480
who just have, never
make it out of the minors

00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:11.470 position:56%
or never even make it to the minors.

00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:15.940
&gt;&gt; One more question, someone's
got that one last question.

00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:18.760
What is it?

00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:22.860
Who's it going to be, alright,
[laughter] thank you so much.

00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:24.160
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
