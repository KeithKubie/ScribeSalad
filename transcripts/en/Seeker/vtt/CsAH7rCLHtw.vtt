00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.340
Okay, now I just email that to Dr. Woo...
and...

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:04.340
Boom!

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:05.340
Done!

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.690
I wonder if they'll find any genetic disorders...

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:17.110
Hey gang, Trace here for DNews with the latest
research on human photography.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.680
Looking for scientific data in photos has
exploded.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.980
Analyzing medical images is big business.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.230
Back in 2012 researchers at MIT's Computer
Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab[a]

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.050
were able to use images of the brain and computer
analysis to track how disorders like schizophrenia

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.500
originate and spread through our grey matter.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.480
The network of cells and connections INSIDE
the brain is slowly being decoded and analyzed.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.870
But to get this procedure you have to go get
your brain scanned a few times...

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.230
Not something you can do with that telephone
in your pocket.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.510
Humans take a lot of pictures, especially
with the introduction of digital photography

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:01.130
-- according to 1000 Memories, humankind has
taken 3.5 trillion photos since 1826, but

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.860
MOST of those have been digital.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.280
We take more photos every minute than were
taken in the whole 19th century[b], and 3

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.549
to 5 percent of all photos taken are selfies[c].

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.409
A neuroscientist from the University College
London believes we love taking selfies because

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.700
we can't see our own face!

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.520
We're learning to move it the way we want,
and show the best version of ourselves.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.880
Scientists at Oxford created a computer which
can explore the millions of images we create

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.369
and look for people with Down's syndrome,
fragile X syndrome, and progeria.

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.060
These rare genetic disorders might be overlooked
by a human doctor, but not Doogie...

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.789
It doesn't have a name, but I think it should
be called Doogie.

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:45.359
This guy uses facial recognition software
to identify 36 feature points of interest

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:48.569
across the face -- called the facial gestalt.

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:52.840
The team identified the parts of the face
and then diagnosed a disorder.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.149
It got it right 93-percent of the time.

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.180
As of this month Doogie knows 90 diseases
and the more faces it learns, the better it

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.539
gets at diagnosing.

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:07.899
There are 7000 different inherited disorders,
and most go undiagnosed.

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.459
But, if this system could send an email to
your doctor narrowing down the expensive and

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:19.840
time-consuming trial and error process of
diagnosing some of these rare disorders.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.530
Hooking something like this into a system
with a lot of photos could be a game-changer

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.819
for people with these hidden disorders!

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:32.780
The Library of Congress (largest library on
the planet) has about 13.7 million photos,

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.680
that's pretty good.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.040
But Facebook has 10,000 times more; their
library is 140 billion photos and growing

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.040
FAST.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.540
As the internet spreads to more and more people
and selfies run amok, the data humanity is

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.140
creating could potentially give a snapshot
of what is happening economically, socially,

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.730
politically, healthily ,and maybe other -allys
too!

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.640
These are potential mines of scientific data.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.409
The selfie future's so bright, I gotta wear
shades.

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:02.739
Worried about privacy?

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:03.739
Excited for the data?

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.379
I'm totally okay with it, but I stand here
every day, so my experience is a little different.
