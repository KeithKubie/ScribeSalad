1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.270
[inaudible].

2
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:05.301
<v 1>All right.</v>

3
00:00:05.301 --> 00:00:09.320
So one of the things that you write about a lot is that the idea of middle class

4
00:00:09.321 --> 00:00:13.700
stagnation is actually wrong.
We hear this all the time.

5
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.870
It from politicians for I think my whole life that I was ever caring about

6
00:00:17.871 --> 00:00:18.381
politics.

7
00:00:18.381 --> 00:00:21.770
It's always that the middle class is shrinking and the extremes are getting

8
00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:25.310
bigger,
et Cetera,
et cetera.
But you actually take a different position on that.

9
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.611
Yeah.

10
00:00:25.611 --> 00:00:29.630
This middle class stagnation thesis is stated as if it's an established fact

11
00:00:29.631 --> 00:00:32.340
with no arguments against it.
It's just,
it's just wrong.
Uh,

12
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.130
I think you were born in the mid seventies,
right?
76.
Okay.

13
00:00:35.131 --> 00:00:37.660
So according to this thesis,
it was,
uh,

14
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.030
it was right around that time mid seventies when apologize.
That's okay.

15
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.320
Maybe it was your fault.
Right?

16
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.160
So the American middle class had been chugging along upward hits the mid

17
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.590
seventies,
and then it's been stagnant ever since.
So the ordinary American say,

18
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.701
so goes,

19
00:00:52.701 --> 00:00:56.900
the thesis lived no better than ordinary Americans lived when Gerald Ford was in

20
00:00:56.901 --> 00:01:00.590
the Oval Office.
I didn't think this is crazy.
I mean,
I have,
um,
um,
uh,

21
00:01:00.591 --> 00:01:03.290
unfortunate old enough to remember the bid 1970s.

22
00:01:03.291 --> 00:01:07.730
And although one zone personal experiences shouldn't be the basis for scientific

23
00:01:07.731 --> 00:01:09.820
conclusions,
they're not irrelevant.
They're thinking,

24
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.000
I know I may come from a working class family.

25
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.790
I remember how we lived in the 70s.
I remember what cars were like.

26
00:01:16.791 --> 00:01:19.190
I remember what television was like.
And I want health care was like,

27
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.760
things are a lot better today for,
for ordinary Americans.

28
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.410
And so I number of years ago just started looking into this,
this thesis,
uh,

29
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.480
there are data that you can find that the people who propose this thesis,
uh,

30
00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.090
uh,
point to,
uh,
uh,

31
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.140
that that lends some superficial credence to the thesis.

32
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.550
But here are just some of the problems with these data.
Uh,
they,

33
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.923
uh,

34
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.400
adjust for inflation in ways that vastly overestimate the amount of inflation

35
00:01:49.401 --> 00:01:51.260
that we've had since the mid seventies.

36
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.490
So mean vastly under counting the growth in real incomes since the 70s.

37
00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.580
A lot of these data,
we'll look at household incomes,
uh,
well,
the SA,

38
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.650
the typical population of the American household has fallen since the mid 1970s.

39
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.070
Today,
it didn't sound like much,

40
00:02:07.071 --> 00:02:11.480
but today it's about 11% lower than it was in 1975.
Uh,

41
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.340
but that's actually pretty significant.

42
00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:17.090
So the same amount of income and a household,
I was spread over fewer people.

43
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.960
And so the individual individual people are,
are,
are,
are richer,

44
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.230
meaning we're just not having as many kids that we're not having as many kids.

45
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.650
We were becoming wealthier so that now,

46
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.550
maybe not in the last 10 years or so,
but for much of this period,
uh,

47
00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:33.920
younger people,
people have been able to move out of their family,

48
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.050
their parents homes at a younger age and start their households.
Younger,
uh,
uh,

49
00:02:39.051 --> 00:02:42.560
older people are able to continue to live by themselves rather than move in with

50
00:02:42.561 --> 00:02:44.790
their,
with their children.
Um,

51
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.560
the quality of goods and the variety of goods and services that Americans,

52
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.350
ordinary Americans have access to today is astonishingly compared to what it was

53
00:02:56.451 --> 00:02:57.710
just 40 years ago.

54
00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.980
I actually spend a lot time looking at catalogs from the mid 1970s,
you know,

55
00:03:02.981 --> 00:03:06.010
Sears Roebuck catalogs and then you can look at,
you know,

56
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.100
sears.com today and you can look at the prices that we charge back.

57
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:13.090
They of course,
nominally they will lower,

58
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.770
but then you just take those prices and you divide them by the wage that the

59
00:03:17.771 --> 00:03:19.390
average American earn back then.

60
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.750
They didn't do the same thing for the prices today and divided by the wage of

61
00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:24.010
the average American owns today.

62
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.250
And what you find in almost all cases is that the amount of time it takes to

63
00:03:29.411 --> 00:03:34.270
work in order to earn enough income to buy a pair of jeans,
uh,
assured Oh,

64
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:36.370
a washer and dryer,
uh,

65
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.570
and an airplane ticket is dramatically less today.
American,

66
00:03:40.571 --> 00:03:43.230
we don't have to work as much today as we did back then in order to get this

67
00:03:43.231 --> 00:03:45.400
things that make our standard of living is high as it is.

68
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.260
So did they just the people that believe in this,

69
00:03:47.261 --> 00:03:49.630
that they just do a great sell job?
I mean,
how did this meme,

70
00:03:49.631 --> 00:03:52.960
how did this idea get out there?
Because you hear this all the time,
everybody,

71
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.900
I mean,
this is one of the few things that you hear on both sides of the aisle.

72
00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.670
Yes.
Yeah.
In fact,
I,
I,
uh,
yes,
uh,

73
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.450
I think the a lot Paul Krugman says it all says it all the time and I think in a

74
00:04:04.451 --> 00:04:07.150
way kind of backfire and people in the left because they keep saying it and
that,

75
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.740
I believe that's one thing that that helped the drum ups popular support for

76
00:04:11.741 --> 00:04:14.290
Donald Trump,
you know,
middle class American women stagnating.

77
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.150
So let's do something about it.
Let's elect Trump.

78
00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.260
There's an interesting psychological thing there because I think maybe most

79
00:04:20.261 --> 00:04:22.180
people think they're in the middle of like,

80
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.380
they probably think it no matter what.
Like they,

81
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.390
if they're not destitute and if they're not,
you know,
worth 20 million bucks,

82
00:04:28.391 --> 00:04:31.930
you probably think basically you're in the middle.

83
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.130
So it's a way of making it about you,
even if it's actually not the case.

84
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.520
You're questioning if I'm not sure exactly,

85
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.760
exactly why it caught by this myth caught on and it has held on with such

86
00:04:44.921 --> 00:04:48.610
tenacity.
Uh,
this myth has been,
gold has been around now for 20 years.

87
00:04:48.611 --> 00:04:52.780
It started in the mid 1990s,
uh,
and it was actually an economist.

88
00:04:52.781 --> 00:04:55.000
He's now at southern Methodist at Smu in Dallas.

89
00:04:55.001 --> 00:04:58.210
He was at the time that an economist at the Dallas Fed guy named Mike Cox,

90
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.810
and he's the first one who really started looking into this.
I said,
well,
let's,

91
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.370
let's,
let's,
let's look at various measures of living standards.

92
00:05:06.371 --> 00:05:11.080
Let's look at how much ordinary people are consuming today compared to in the

93
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.460
mid seventies.
Let's,
let's,
let's,
let's,

94
00:05:12.461 --> 00:05:15.880
let's look at what happens when we adjust for income using better inflation.

95
00:05:15.881 --> 00:05:20.530
Adjusters can a,
and w Mike Cox Found,
and I,
I,

96
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.360
my work is derivative of my Cox is that once you start doing this,

97
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.770
this whole middle class stagnation thing just crumbles into dust.

98
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.270
It's just not true.
It's not to say that there are no problems.

99
00:05:34.271 --> 00:05:38.440
It's not to say that the middleclass wouldn't be even wealthier had they're not

100
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.870
had,
they'd been better policies in place.

101
00:05:40.871 --> 00:05:42.580
Whatever you think those policies might be.

102
00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.870
But it is to say that is just crazy to believe that an ordinary American or an

103
00:05:46.871 --> 00:05:50.800
ordinary American family in 2018 has a standard of living that is

104
00:05:50.801 --> 00:05:54.400
indistinguishable from that of an ordinary American family in 1975.
Yeah.

105
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.070
Do you know what basically economics look

106
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.070
<v 2>like if you were considered in the middleclass right now,
like the economics,</v>

107
00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.600
are there really like numbers that you look at on both sides and go,
all right,

108
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.070
that's what middleclass is.
Cause I think that's part of the problem.

109
00:06:07.071 --> 00:06:08.890
It is this sort of a morphous term.

110
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:12.730
<v 1>Yes.
Yeah.
Uh,
no,
I,
I don't believe that there,
I mean,
you know,
the,
the,</v>

111
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.590
the Census Bureau,
among others,
they will divide household income into quintiles.

112
00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:21.130
Uh,
I don't recall what those numbers are at the moment,

113
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.760
but a common definition is you take the three Middle Quintile,

114
00:06:24.761 --> 00:06:26.110
so you get rid of the top 20%.

115
00:06:26.111 --> 00:06:29.170
You were in the bottom 20% and you have the middle 60% that's,

116
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.110
that's the middle class and upper middle,
middle,
middle,
lower,
middle.
Uh,

117
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.920
but the Census Bureau does something interesting from time to time.
It,

118
00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:41.040
so it divides household income and to different categories less than 15,000,

119
00:06:42.131 --> 00:06:47.131
15,000 to 25,000 on and on up to like I think 250,000 and above and attracts

120
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.900
adjusting for inflation.
It tracks household incomes over time.

121
00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:56.020
And you can't in a perverse way,

122
00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:00.860
finding these data that the middle class in America is disappearing,
right?

123
00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.800
But it's disappearing into the upper classes.

124
00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:07.510
If you look at the percentage of households in America who are earning,
uh,

125
00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:12.250
in the lowest percentages,
right?
They're shrinking.
The only,

126
00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:17.500
only categories in which the percentage of households in the u s are increasing

127
00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:21.940
or in the upper income levels.
And so actually I think the very lowest,

128
00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:24.460
it might have ticked up a little bit like the blessing 15,000,

129
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:25.900
but in the great middle,

130
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.760
they have fewer households percentagewise earning in those categories today,

131
00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:36.070
but more earning $100,000 annually.
And above.

132
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.650
And so in one sense,
yes,
it's shrinking,
but it's getting Richard,

133
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:40.480
there's no evidence that we're getting poor.

134
00:07:40.481 --> 00:07:41.740
There's no evidence that it stagnating.

135
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:46.250
<v 2>Yeah.
So we talked a little bit in an ancillary way about taxes,
uh,
earlier.</v>

136
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.110
So I'm not an economist,

137
00:07:48.111 --> 00:07:52.250
but I'm going to lay out what I think is sort of a fair tax system that's

138
00:07:52.251 --> 00:07:54.560
consistent with all the ideals that we've talked about here.

139
00:07:54.561 --> 00:07:58.220
And I want you to [inaudible] either I'm going to be,

140
00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.610
either I'm going to blow your mind or you're going to tell me that I'm way off.

141
00:08:01.611 --> 00:08:04.370
So something like this,
this is what I've said a couple times,

142
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:08.780
is that I'm basically four attacks a flat tax.
You can get rid of exemptions.

143
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:12.230
Let's say it's about 15% but we can,
we can fiddle with the numbers,

144
00:08:12.231 --> 00:08:17.231
but let's about 15% I would exempt everyone making let's say less than like 40

145
00:08:18.111 --> 00:08:20.350
grand,
maybe even 50 grand.
Oh.

146
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.720
So that they have a little more disposable income that they can do things,
which,

147
00:08:23.721 --> 00:08:25.550
which I think is good for them and good for the economy.

148
00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:27.710
And then just because I'm still,

149
00:08:27.711 --> 00:08:29.990
I still have a little bit of a guilty liberal in me,

150
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:35.320
I would even be willing to do some sort of progressive tax if you're over say 10

151
00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:39.920
million a year or something like that,
even though I know it's not right,

152
00:08:39.921 --> 00:08:43.250
and I'm sure you can get rid of that by the end of this conversation,

153
00:08:43.251 --> 00:08:44.840
but there's still a piece of me that says that.

154
00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:49.280
But basically saying that for the huge,
vast majority of the country,

155
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:53.840
15% literal exemptions may be a little trickery on the high end.

156
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:56.070
I think that's consistent with the

157
00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:00.390
<v 1>sort of classical liberal idea of minimal involvement and and equality of</v>

158
00:09:00.391 --> 00:09:03.780
opportunity and what you're all paying in and hopefully it would cause a slim or

159
00:09:03.781 --> 00:09:07.920
trim or government.
So,
so some glimmering in your eye.
And so as I said earlier,

160
00:09:07.921 --> 00:09:10.530
I think one of the distinguishing features of an economist has always asks us

161
00:09:10.531 --> 00:09:13.350
compared to what?
Right.
As compared to what we have now.
Right.

162
00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:16.660
That that's close to perfect.
All right.
I'll take it right.

163
00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.590
As compared to what my actual ideal would be,

164
00:09:19.591 --> 00:09:22.770
given that we're going to have taxes,
it's not quite my ideal.

165
00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:25.400
I would indeed get rid of the,
the,
the,

166
00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:29.580
the progression at the guilty part of me.
I think that still exists,

167
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.680
one of them for,

168
00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:34.860
so the way I look at the way I look at people who earn those kinds of Jane comes

169
00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:38.220
assuming they earn,
and most of them do,
they earn these incomes in the market.

170
00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:42.180
That means that these people are especially good at making life better for

171
00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:44.580
ordinary Americans.
They're especially good at creating jobs.

172
00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:48.540
They're especially good at,
at increasing the value of my 401k.

173
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.040
But what would you say when people say,

174
00:09:50.041 --> 00:09:53.800
but they don't need eight yachts and helicopters and all that?
Uh,

175
00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:57.350
I would say they earned,
it's theirs.
It's not up to me to say what they,

176
00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:01.310
they earn their money.
I can make an argument against that.
I know it's,
there's,

177
00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:05.340
uh,
I mean,
look again,
you know,
if your system is better than what we have now,

178
00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:10.370
but definitely if we're going to have income taxation of flat tax and I'm

179
00:10:10.501 --> 00:10:12.990
willing to have the exemption for the lower lower incomes,

180
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:15.570
flat tax is the way to go.
Uh,
uh,

181
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:20.600
not only does it prevent a lot of political chicanery messing with brackets and,

182
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:27.360
uh,
but it,
it's,
it is economically the better system.

183
00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:32.160
Uh,
when you tax all income earning activities at the,
at the same rate,

184
00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:36.840
then the relative prices of different types of labor services stays the same.

185
00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.550
When you have progressive taxation,

186
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:42.420
you create greater distortions in the economy.
And that,

187
00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:45.570
that makes us as an ex,
as,
as,
uh,

188
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:49.590
as residents of this economy and makes us all a little bit less wealthy than we

189
00:10:49.591 --> 00:10:52.350
otherwise would be because the economy has to deal with these distortions.

190
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:56.760
So what do we do about spending?
Because at the end of the day,
that seems,

191
00:10:56.761 --> 00:10:58.940
at least when we were talking about this from a government perspective,

192
00:10:58.941 --> 00:11:00.930
that it's really all about spending,

193
00:11:00.931 --> 00:11:03.990
that you can tax out the Wazoo and regardless of whether that tanks,

194
00:11:03.991 --> 00:11:06.600
the economy or,
or fixes it or whatever,

195
00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:09.210
that's almost irrelevant if you just keep spending,

196
00:11:09.211 --> 00:11:11.260
especially because of the amount of debt we have and we're,

197
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:12.690
we know we're never going to pay it back,

198
00:11:12.691 --> 00:11:14.730
which is why it's probably good that we have a lot of bombs,

199
00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:17.960
but that's a whole lot then that's a whole other discussion.
Um,
you know,

200
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:21.390
because one day if trying to call in the debt,
you know,
we're,

201
00:11:21.391 --> 00:11:23.520
we're in a lot of trouble but,
but how do you reign in spending,

202
00:11:23.521 --> 00:11:25.830
cause this seems to be the thing that all the Trump people,
right,

203
00:11:25.831 --> 00:11:29.660
they all thought he was going to reign in spending this on the opposite pack.

204
00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:33.030
And it's,
it's,
I think it's more than ever before.
It is.
It is.
Yeah.

205
00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:37.350
So I think the big questions,
I don't know how to do it.

206
00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:40.050
We can speculate about know changing the constitution,

207
00:11:40.051 --> 00:11:42.360
put in constitutional balanced budget amendments,

208
00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:45.780
constitutional caps on spending.
I'm skeptical of all of those things.

209
00:11:45.781 --> 00:11:50.100
The government has many ways to get around these,
these paper tiger provisions.

210
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:52.980
Uh,
the problem is the,

211
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:57.640
is Americans today look to government and they,
and they,
they basically,

212
00:11:57.641 --> 00:12:01.060
you're spending other people's money and so if you're spending other people's

213
00:12:01.061 --> 00:12:04.120
money,
it's easy to spend.
My,
my former colleague,

214
00:12:04.121 --> 00:12:07.420
Russ Roberts had a piece in the Wall Street Journal many years ago entitled

215
00:12:07.421 --> 00:12:10.250
something like,
if you're paying,
I'm having steak.
So imagine,
you know,

216
00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:13.540
imagine that we all go to a restaurant and you know,
the different menu items,

217
00:12:13.541 --> 00:12:13.980
right?
Well,

218
00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:17.280
if you've got a restaurant and you're picking up your part of the tab,
right,
you,

219
00:12:17.281 --> 00:12:18.730
you,
you may order steak,

220
00:12:18.731 --> 00:12:21.770
but that's because it's worthwhile to you and you'll have to pay for it.
Uh,

221
00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.420
but you might,
if you have to pay for it,
you might not,
or sick,

222
00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:27.490
you might order a less expensive dish.
But if it's going to be shit,

223
00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.660
even as you can be shared right then,

224
00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:34.690
then the bulk of your extra expenditure is shared with the people you're going

225
00:12:34.691 --> 00:12:37.300
to dinner with.
And that's true for every person at the dinner.

226
00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:41.800
And so you wind up with this bizarre circumstance where every person acting

227
00:12:41.801 --> 00:12:46.801
rationally winds up ordering too much wind up asking of the restaurant too much.

228
00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:49.810
We wind up asking if our government too much,

229
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:54.490
but we have to pay for the resources,
do not fall out of the sky free.

230
00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.300
They're coming from somewhere and,
and because we're spending too much,

231
00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:01.090
we're taking resources from where they would be better used and putting them

232
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.190
where really none of us want them to be used,

233
00:13:03.191 --> 00:13:05.050
but we all wind up using them there.

234
00:13:05.051 --> 00:13:08.020
I know you said before that an antidotal story is not,
you know,

235
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:10.830
proof of a bigger theory,
but as you're saying that,
it reminded,

236
00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:11.920
I don't think I've ever said this publicly,

237
00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:15.730
publicly before at my brother's Bachelor Party when I was a struggling comic and

238
00:13:15.731 --> 00:13:18.820
I had no money.
You know,
I had maybe 50 bucks in my pocket.
I don't know.

239
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:19.850
I was the best man.

240
00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.420
All his friends were in banking and the little areas and they all had money.

241
00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:25.510
Big rollers were at a fancy one.
The one fancy place,

242
00:13:25.511 --> 00:13:28.480
the Borgata in Atlantic city,
the one fancy,
you know,

243
00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:33.540
nice place in Atlantic city and we're sitting around this huge table at a really

244
00:13:33.551 --> 00:13:35.290
super fancy restaurant and,

245
00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:39.610
and all the entrees are 80 9,000 bucks and I'm looking at him,
I'm like,
you know,

246
00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:43.090
what am I going to do here?
I was going to get the chicken for maybe 50 bucks.

247
00:13:43.091 --> 00:13:44.320
He was saying,
and I was sitting with my,

248
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:47.530
my brother's one friend who also is kind of struggling like I was,

249
00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.200
and we're both saying,
all right,
we're going to get the chicken for 50 bucks.

250
00:13:50.201 --> 00:13:53.680
We go around,
everyone's getting steak,
lobster,
steak,
lobster,
steak,
lobster,
steak,

251
00:13:53.681 --> 00:13:55.870
lobster.
It gets to my friend Josh.
He turned,

252
00:13:55.871 --> 00:13:58.420
he's the whole time he's gone and I'm getting the chicken for him that the

253
00:13:58.421 --> 00:14:00.970
waitress says,
what do you want?
He goes,
lobster.
And then I just said,

254
00:14:00.971 --> 00:14:03.820
state like that,
like,
and it's exactly what you're talking about.

255
00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:08.440
You suddenly lose concept of what's in your pocket,
somehow it's going to happen,

256
00:14:08.441 --> 00:14:11.470
right?
And get the bill's going to be shared.
Then the,
the,
the,
the,

257
00:14:11.471 --> 00:14:16.450
the additional cost to you of ordering states adopt a tiny fraction of the

258
00:14:16.451 --> 00:14:19.420
actual additional cost of the steak.
And that's the problem with,

259
00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:20.500
with government today.

260
00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.910
We have people in Washington spending other people's money for the benefit of

261
00:14:24.911 --> 00:14:29.050
yet other people.
And when you do that,
you just get too much,

262
00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.590
too much spending.
Uh,
we,
we've,
I don't know a better way to say it.

263
00:14:32.591 --> 00:14:34.280
It doesn't sound very economic.
I understand it,

264
00:14:34.281 --> 00:14:38.800
but we've lost the ethic of respecting other people's property.

265
00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:41.050
Once government gets money,

266
00:14:41.051 --> 00:14:45.670
once government officials figure out something that they fancy is,
is,

267
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:49.060
is good,
and it may or may not really be good,
uh,

268
00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:52.640
which doesn't mean necessarily it's worthwhile,
but maybe a good project.

269
00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.710
That doesn't mean that therefore we should go ahead and spend money on it.
Uh,

270
00:14:56.830 --> 00:15:01.550
there's an insufficient connection between the spending and the,
and,
and the,

271
00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:05.240
and the experience of the cost of the resources that go into the spending.

272
00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:08.540
How much are you have this do you think is not an economic problem,

273
00:15:08.541 --> 00:15:13.370
but a political problem so that if a politician was to get this right,

274
00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:16.610
let's say there's some magical politician out there who really understands

275
00:15:16.611 --> 00:15:19.430
economics,
but he knows if he goes to the Senate.

276
00:15:19.431 --> 00:15:23.660
So I suspect grandpa's kind of like this.
I think he basically gets this.
Yeah,

277
00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.620
and he does fight the best fight generally that I think he can,

278
00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:32.630
but that these guys want to get reelected and saying to people,

279
00:15:32.631 --> 00:15:36.470
we're going to spend less on you,
even though you know it's,

280
00:15:36.471 --> 00:15:38.330
it's the best thing we can do for you.
Actually.

281
00:15:38.331 --> 00:15:41.990
It's going to free you one day and it's not going to have tank the economy and

282
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:44.960
make us,
you know,
slaves to a foreign nation and all that.

283
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:48.940
It just doesn't work politically because it's not the easy answer of give them

284
00:15:48.941 --> 00:15:50.810
more.
I think that's exactly right.
Let's face it.

285
00:15:50.811 --> 00:15:55.270
Each politician has a timeframe that extends to the next election.
Right?

286
00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.740
So in the case of members of the house,
that's only two years.

287
00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:01.910
The case with the present,
that's four senators,
six,
that's not a long time frame.

288
00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:06.920
Anything beyond that time frame is irrelevant to that person politically today.

289
00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.690
Uh,
or to make it relevant,

290
00:16:08.691 --> 00:16:12.830
that person has to have an ethic that is very rare and unusual among politicians

291
00:16:12.831 --> 00:16:15.980
and people with that.
They,
I think,
tend not to be not to succeed in politics.

292
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.280
Yeah,
a handful do manage to get in,
but very few.

293
00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.490
So you have people without that ethic and they're just looking toward the next

294
00:16:22.491 --> 00:16:24.320
election,
which is that most,
again,
only,
you know,

295
00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:26.090
two years away for a house member.

296
00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:29.510
And so if the bill is coming due two and a half years from now,
if the,

297
00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:33.530
if whatever other costs are going to happen to an half years from now,
uh,
or,

298
00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:37.260
or alternatively,
if,
if taking some action that's only going to hit,

299
00:16:37.261 --> 00:16:41.030
it's going to have cost today.
But,
but huge benefits,
no matter how huge,

300
00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:44.660
two years from now,
four years from now,
I'm not gonna take it right because it's,

301
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:47.510
that will do nothing to get them past that next hurdle,

302
00:16:47.511 --> 00:16:49.130
which is getting elected reelected.

303
00:16:49.131 --> 00:16:53.000
So in a very depressing sense or in a sort of dystopian future sense,

304
00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:57.380
are we in a certain way?
Are we on a pathway to destruction no matter what?

305
00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:01.010
If you think about it,
I mean,
if you take that line of thinking long enough,

306
00:17:01.011 --> 00:17:01.190
right?

307
00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:06.190
So we have a sort of weak political crew dealing in ways that are the reverse of

308
00:17:08.301 --> 00:17:12.270
how economically we can be successful.
Pretty right.

309
00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:16.710
Pretty much always going off the off the cliff.
So I,

310
00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:20.120
despite all that I've said,
I remain optimistic and I'm not,
I'm not sure why.

311
00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:24.850
All right.
Uh,
I feel the same way.
I remain optimistic.
Um,

312
00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.113
we,

313
00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:31.270
we still have a respect for private property in the United States.

314
00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:36.820
We were still a very entrepreneurial culture.
Uh,
uh,

315
00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:41.890
we still hold politicians to some,

316
00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:46.890
this is less now,
but there's some level of,
of,
uh,

317
00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.890
responsibility.
I say that,
um,

318
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.410
my libertarian friends are going to kill me for saying,

319
00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:56.900
I think there's something,
there's something there.
Yeah.
Uh,
look,

320
00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:59.190
the political problem has always been there.

321
00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.650
I think the cost us constitution in the past,

322
00:18:01.651 --> 00:18:05.100
up until about eight years ago maybe did serve more as a constraint that has

323
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:09.480
largely been shoved away.
Um,
but by and large,

324
00:18:09.481 --> 00:18:13.350
we've still prospered over the past 80 years,
uh,

325
00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:15.510
almost in spite of,
of ourselves.

326
00:18:15.511 --> 00:18:19.230
So this summer is something in the American mindset.

327
00:18:19.231 --> 00:18:23.730
There's something in our gumption,
uh,
and I,
I'm,

328
00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:25.670
I don't want to sound like a mob Rah Rah,

329
00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:30.240
but there's something about this society of ours that remains,

330
00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:35.250
remains relatively open,
remains relatively free property,

331
00:18:35.251 --> 00:18:37.860
private property rights remain relatively secure.

332
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:42.720
I think we still have something of a,
of a rule of law in,
in place.

333
00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:48.440
And what I've learned in the 40 or so years that I've been pondering these

334
00:18:48.481 --> 00:18:53.190
issues is that a free society is far more robust than I once believed it to be,

335
00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:57.540
which is not to excuse or justify any of the abuses that it takes,

336
00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:59.220
but it's really robust.

337
00:18:59.221 --> 00:19:03.660
And I have no good sense of where the point is.

338
00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:05.700
I don't believe it's indestructable.
Yeah.

339
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.150
But I have no good sense of where the point is where you hit that point and

340
00:19:09.151 --> 00:19:12.030
suddenly things are destined to go into the,
into the gutter.

341
00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:15.390
We may be moving there now.

342
00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:20.580
I have a 21 year old son for his sake.
I certainly hope we're not close to that.

343
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.560
Uh,
but my gosh,

344
00:19:22.561 --> 00:19:27.540
if you look back to the 1930s I think things will be even worse than idealize

345
00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:31.740
governor,
you know,
the,
the,
the trend of government wise than they are today.

346
00:19:31.741 --> 00:19:33.480
And yet we did pretty well.

347
00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:37.180
<v 2>I,
I'm glad that you just said idealize because one of the things that I focus in</v>

348
00:19:37.181 --> 00:19:39.290
on here is talking about ideas they matter.

349
00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:41.450
That's the whole purpose of what I do.

350
00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:46.660
Do you think that these ideas related to freedom and the individual and laissez

351
00:19:47.871 --> 00:19:51.620
faire capitalism and all of the things that we've discussed here are taking root

352
00:19:51.621 --> 00:19:52.910
again because that's how I started.

353
00:19:52.911 --> 00:19:56.720
You mentioned my interview with Tom and soul right before we started and I sent

354
00:19:56.721 --> 00:19:57.920
it,
and again this is,

355
00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:02.060
I can only tell you what I'm personally feeling and what the feedback I get and

356
00:20:02.061 --> 00:20:05.420
all that.
But I said to Thomas or to Dr Soil,
I said,

357
00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:09.440
do you realize the renaissance of your work is having?
And I think he's kind of,

358
00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:13.130
he's kind of just over it personally.
I think he's proud of his work.
But I think,

359
00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:16.490
yeah,
and of course he shouldn't be.
But I think just on a personal note,

360
00:20:16.491 --> 00:20:19.220
he's kind of like,
yeah,
I've been doing this for a long time and that's great,

361
00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:21.470
but I really sense these things are taking root again,

362
00:20:21.471 --> 00:20:23.930
even though the mainstream media won't let you really believe that and they

363
00:20:23.931 --> 00:20:27.890
still will always elevate the people that are pushing a lot of the more

364
00:20:27.891 --> 00:20:29.980
socialist stuff instead of some people with some.

365
00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:32.540
<v 1>So getting,
getting back to something I split,
we said earlier,</v>

366
00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:37.490
I think it took a lot of people by surprise in the late 1970s when the ideas for

367
00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:42.060
cutting marginal tax rates dereg deregulation,
uh,

368
00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:46.550
took hold.
And I think that's because people like Milton Friedman,
uh,
my,

369
00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:51.340
my late colleague James Buchanan had been working years earlier in helping to

370
00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:53.260
hire years early to,

371
00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:57.940
to make these ideas sound and accepted and they were in place.

372
00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:03.150
And when the crisis of the 70s hit those ideas had an effect.
Uh,

373
00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.050
no one knows the future.

374
00:21:05.051 --> 00:21:08.050
The future's not destined to repeat itself in the way that it did then.

375
00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:12.990
But there are a lot of really good people are,
you're doing great work.
Uh,

376
00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:18.060
there were a lot of really creative young people today push refining these

377
00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:19.720
ideas,
polishing ideas,

378
00:21:19.721 --> 00:21:24.610
presenting them to the general public in new and more interesting ways.
And uh,

379
00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:28.930
maybe it's a hope over maybe the hope over,

380
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:31.480
I don't know,
hope over reality,

381
00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:36.340
but I actually believe that these ideas are strong.

382
00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:40.750
I think they are appealing and there they are out there.

383
00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:45.190
And while today in May 19,

384
00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:49.300
May,
2018,
uh,
we can't see when they'll take root,

385
00:21:49.301 --> 00:21:53.290
but I think that they will in fact protect us.

386
00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:57.070
That's so that is the optimist in you and I have that too because otherwise,

387
00:21:57.071 --> 00:21:59.740
how could we do what we do?
Right?
I mean if,
if the answer,

388
00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:01.570
if you had looked at me 10 minutes ago and said,
yeah,

389
00:22:01.571 --> 00:22:05.670
pretty much we got to go off the edge,
that one,

390
00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:09.520
then I would have had some of the booze you have about behind me here.

391
00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:14.080
Let's just start drinking right now.
Just wait for Armageddon.
Yeah,
no,
I,
I,
I,
look,

392
00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:18.670
I believe here's something that I did not fully appreciate 20 years ago that I

393
00:22:18.671 --> 00:22:21.730
do appreciate now.
20 years ago I was a more,

394
00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.760
a hard nosed economist and now ideas are really irrelevant.

395
00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:27.430
They don't matter that much.
It's,
it's,
you know,
you know,

396
00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.670
the institutional constraints.
I do think institutional constraints matter.

397
00:22:30.671 --> 00:22:31.504
They're important,

398
00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:36.750
but I've come to see ideas as by far the single most important constraint and

399
00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:43.980
fuel for a society largely affected by the work of Deirdre mccloskey of,

400
00:22:44.511 --> 00:22:47.420
I think you had on,
it was one of my favorite chats that we met you.

401
00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:51.070
You interviewed Deirdre's work has influenced me greatly and her work,

402
00:22:51.071 --> 00:22:51.851
she's not the only one,

403
00:22:51.851 --> 00:22:54.790
but she's done more than any other modern economists to make the case for the

404
00:22:54.791 --> 00:22:58.150
role of ideas.
And I think she's correct.
She's correct in that.

405
00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.780
So in that you must be incredibly hopeful then.
Cause I,

406
00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:03.520
I mean I feel the idea revolution.

407
00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:06.670
I'd mentor with Jordan Peterson now and I keeps going up there and saying

408
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:09.160
there's,
there's the right kind of revolution happening.

409
00:23:09.161 --> 00:23:10.840
We're not killing each other in the streets yet.

410
00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:14.240
And how does that get stopped by an idea revolution?
Yeah.
And you're so,

411
00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:19.280
so at the beginning I mentioned that I came to economics because I was impressed

412
00:23:19.481 --> 00:23:23.320
how economics explained though gasoline shortages in the 1970s so I don't,

413
00:23:23.321 --> 00:23:26.320
if you remember a few years ago,
you know,
gasoline,
Pr Obama was in office,

414
00:23:26.321 --> 00:23:28.870
gasoline prices are rising,
people are complaining.

415
00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:33.250
Here's the importance of idea ideas.
There were,
there were no serious calls,

416
00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:34.240
even the,

417
00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:39.240
in the Obama administration to go back to 1970 style price caps on,

418
00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:42.670
on energy.
I took that as a,
as a,
as a good sign.

419
00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:44.650
That's saying it won't happen in the future.

420
00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:49.260
But I believe the reason that was the case is because the economists who,

421
00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:50.380
Milton Friedman,

422
00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:56.720
among others who explain the devastating roles of price ceilings on energy,

423
00:23:56.810 --> 00:24:00.080
those ideas was still around.
There,
was still out there,
still out there,

424
00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:05.180
and they prevented anyone who would propose such policies seriously from being

425
00:24:05.181 --> 00:24:06.470
taken seriously.
And so that,

426
00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:11.900
that notion of returning to the seventies style price caps just never got a

427
00:24:11.901 --> 00:24:16.070
hearing a few years ago when gasoline prices were high.
So that,
that,
that,
that,

428
00:24:16.071 --> 00:24:20.510
that's one data point that supports,
uh,
our optimism.

429
00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:23.970
<v 2>Yeah.
That,
that's great.
I mean,
you know,
it's a long game,
right?
I mean that,</v>

430
00:24:23.971 --> 00:24:25.620
that's the point.
It is a long game.

431
00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:30.390
I want to talk a little bit about regulation before,
before we wrap up.
I had a,

432
00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:33.750
you may know him,
the biology professor,
Bret Weinstein,

433
00:24:33.751 --> 00:24:36.570
who's been on the show and he's a,
he's a friend of mine.
Uh,

434
00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:39.180
he made an interesting comment to me the other day.

435
00:24:39.181 --> 00:24:42.300
I think maybe he tweeted out and then we discussed it a little bit about,
well,

436
00:24:42.301 --> 00:24:45.930
if you're,
if you're taking the true libertarian approach and you're against all

437
00:24:45.931 --> 00:24:46.764
regulation,

438
00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:51.390
well are you saying that you want no regulation over the airlines for example,

439
00:24:51.391 --> 00:24:54.210
they have any safety regulations or anything like that and what I,

440
00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:57.260
we didn't have a ton of time to get into the conversation.
I said,
I said Brett,

441
00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:57.961
very quickly,

442
00:24:57.961 --> 00:25:00.960
what I would say is I think airlines are in the business of getting people from

443
00:25:00.961 --> 00:25:04.530
one place to another and they do all their due diligence and if the idea of a

444
00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:08.400
government bureaucrat coming in to make sure that this little thing is this way

445
00:25:08.401 --> 00:25:11.220
as if they have more knowledge about it than the,
they are online people.

446
00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:14.430
I find that to be pretty faulty but,
but we sort of left the conversation there.

447
00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:19.670
<v 1>What do you,
what is the right amount of regulation as a,
as a Libertarian,
oh,</v>

448
00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:23.080
I'm in favor of huge amounts of regulation and I'm not being facetious.

449
00:25:23.081 --> 00:25:27.490
I love regulation.
I believe the best regulator is on the market.

450
00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:30.930
It's a competitive market is consumers being able to spend their money,
uh,

451
00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:33.400
as they choose and or not to spend it as they choose.

452
00:25:33.401 --> 00:25:35.980
It's the freedom of different,
uh,

453
00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:39.730
producers and entrepreneurs to enter markets or leave markets as they choose.

454
00:25:39.731 --> 00:25:43.600
It's the competition among producers.
That's where real regulation comes from.

455
00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:45.550
The market regulates activities.
You're,

456
00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:50.080
you're right about the they're learning instance.
Airlines for example.
Uh,

457
00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:54.340
no one has a stronger incentive to make sure that a multimillion dollar piece of

458
00:25:54.341 --> 00:25:56.680
machinery doesn't just willy nilly fall out of the sky.

459
00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:59.590
Then the owner of that multimillion dollar piece of machinery,

460
00:25:59.591 --> 00:26:02.860
namely the airlines or the company that they're there,
they're renting it from.

461
00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:07.150
And so the competition among the airlines,
the,
the,
the,

462
00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:09.760
the need for them to protect their investments.

463
00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:15.120
That is a tremendous source of regulation and it's a very nuanced source of

464
00:26:15.641 --> 00:26:16.900
regulations.
He gets it right.

465
00:26:16.901 --> 00:26:20.410
And it's not subject to political control or political manipulation.

466
00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:25.120
So governor so called government regulation is too often,

467
00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:28.600
uh,
actually deregulation in the worst sense.

468
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:33.460
It's government relieving businesses of the need to be as responsive to

469
00:26:33.461 --> 00:26:37.290
consumers as they would otherwise need to be.
So we,
we,
we,
we call for example,
uh,

470
00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:41.920
uh,
uh,
occupational licensing.
And that's a form of regulation.
Well,

471
00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:44.130
no,
it's a form of deregulation.

472
00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:48.820
It dereg it deregulates the,
uh,

473
00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:52.920
existing producers in the market from having to be as responsive as they

474
00:26:52.921 --> 00:26:55.260
otherwise would to consumers.
So for example,

475
00:26:55.261 --> 00:26:58.660
this would be like you have to have a license to cut hair.
Yes,
yes.
Yeah.

476
00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:03.370
And so if,
if I,
if I'm a hair braider or a barber,
uh,
or,

477
00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:06.300
or an electrician,
and if this,

478
00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:10.470
if the government prevents people from entering in competition with me,

479
00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:14.100
that makes my life easier.
I don't have to be as responsive to consumers.

480
00:27:14.101 --> 00:27:18.480
I can charge higher prices.
I could supply a less high quality services.

481
00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:23.730
And so I am deregulated in fact by that,
so called regulation.

482
00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:27.450
So we basically,
you would say it's the risk you have to take to be free,
right.

483
00:27:27.451 --> 00:27:28.500
So that in other words,

484
00:27:28.501 --> 00:27:31.290
that if you're an electrician and I have somebody come into my kitchen,

485
00:27:31.291 --> 00:27:33.750
we had a little light thing the other day now.
Yes.

486
00:27:33.751 --> 00:27:35.850
The guy who was licensed I guess cause there's got to be licensed.

487
00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:39.930
But you're saying it's just the risk that you have to take because he doesn't

488
00:27:39.931 --> 00:27:43.560
want to come in here and burn my house down and nor do you want him to do it.

489
00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:48.300
Right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
[inaudible] this is another unintended consequence of so,

490
00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:52.410
so called government regulation and that if people come to depend on it too much

491
00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:55.590
there,
you just assume whoever you call up,
call up and say,

492
00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:59.040
I need some electrical work done in my house.
Well,

493
00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:03.210
we live in a state where electricians unregulated.
So this God must be okay.
Um,

494
00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:08.550
uh,
maybe,
maybe not.
But if you knew that was up to you to check,

495
00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.170
first of all,
the market supplies,

496
00:28:10.171 --> 00:28:14.640
all of these wonderful ways of verifying a quality.

497
00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:19.710
So if anyone was free to practice being an electrician,
uh,

498
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:21.870
you would have easy access.
You as a consumer,

499
00:28:21.871 --> 00:28:25.520
we have easy access to various mechanisms to,
to,
to,

500
00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:27.960
to rain various electricians by how,

501
00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:32.330
especially in earlier then all the apps and absolutely.
Yeah.
So it's,
it's,
it's a,

502
00:28:32.331 --> 00:28:37.331
it's a total myth to think that the government is more concerned about our

503
00:28:38.281 --> 00:28:41.280
welfare and our property.
Then we are,

504
00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:43.440
who's more concerned about your house than you are,

505
00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:48.270
who's more concerned about your personal safety and health?
Then you are,
uh,

506
00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:52.260
the government might pretend that it's more concerned or that it's somehow has

507
00:28:52.261 --> 00:28:57.120
deeper insight to what is best for you.
But I don't buy it.
Uh,
I think,

508
00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.230
I think young children,
uh,
they're,

509
00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:03.030
they don't know their interest as well as their parents do.

510
00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:04.410
But once you become an adult,

511
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:08.670
the presumption must be that each of us as an adult cares for and knows our best

512
00:29:08.671 --> 00:29:11.580
interests much better than any third party does reminded of something else.

513
00:29:11.581 --> 00:29:11.731
Right.

514
00:29:11.731 --> 00:29:15.270
And I think maybe I got too many of my old economic theories from the Simpsons

515
00:29:15.271 --> 00:29:19.980
because now do you remember the episode very early on with Mr. Burns at the

516
00:29:19.981 --> 00:29:22.470
power plant and he's leaking,
you know,

517
00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:26.530
nuclear waste into the river and they get a three eyed fish and every,

518
00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:29.910
they are whole idea being,
if you just let business do what it wants,

519
00:29:29.911 --> 00:29:32.460
it's going to pollute the river and you're going to be eating three eyed fish.

520
00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:35.980
But that's completely the reverse of everything you've said that.
Yeah.
So,
so,

521
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.220
so what,
what an economist would say to that as well,
you know,

522
00:29:38.221 --> 00:29:40.660
there are some areas where uh,

523
00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:45.050
your as a private citizen spill over onto a,

524
00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.860
an innocent third party,
so they have no input.

525
00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:51.940
So like reasonable people can disagree about the proper role of government in

526
00:29:51.941 --> 00:29:55.270
preventing pollution or,
or preventing third party effects.

527
00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:58.780
But so much regulation has nothing to do with third party affects.

528
00:29:58.781 --> 00:30:01.870
It's simply to say,
you know,
if you want to get your hair braided,
uh,

529
00:30:01.871 --> 00:30:03.790
you have to go to one of these people that we approve,

530
00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.980
you're not allowed to go to that person over there,
uh,
who,

531
00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:10.390
who does not yet have our approval.
Well,
there's no third party in fact here.

532
00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:15.280
And a surprising amount of regulation is of that sort.
Yeah.
I mean,

533
00:30:15.281 --> 00:30:18.220
I remember when I bought this house and you have to have all the people come by

534
00:30:18.221 --> 00:30:19.330
and the inspectors and everything,

535
00:30:19.331 --> 00:30:22.330
and they're looking for these little absurd things that I'm talking with the

536
00:30:22.331 --> 00:30:25.900
builder about.
And well,
this has to be an issue this way over here and blah,
blah,

537
00:30:25.901 --> 00:30:29.880
blah.
And it's like,
why?
There was no answer for it.
I mean,
a couple times I said,

538
00:30:29.881 --> 00:30:34.260
well,
why is that?
And you know,
it's the regulations to regulate.

539
00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:38.200
That's how it is.
I'm someone in Sacramento's said,
this is how it should be,

540
00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.280
and that's how it is and everybody,
everybody has.

541
00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:43.210
So another problem with government regulation,
uh,

542
00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:48.270
is that it's one size fits all.
And I don't care how smart you are,

543
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:53.380
are,
uh,
uh,
how,
how much experience you have in the past.

544
00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:57.760
Uh,
particularly in our highly dynamic,
in our highly dynamic economy,

545
00:30:57.761 --> 00:31:02.230
things are always changing.
Different people have different risk tolerances.

546
00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:07.380
Um,
so one of my least favorite regulators as the FDA,
uh,

547
00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:11.410
there are very few third party effects with the FDA.
The FDA is,
uh,
uh,

548
00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:16.500
drug regulation affects you and it prevents you in consultation if you choose

549
00:31:17.741 --> 00:31:21.130
with your doctor.
And most sensible people would consult with a physician,
uh,

550
00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:25.120
from choosing what level of risks you're able to subject yourself to in order to

551
00:31:25.121 --> 00:31:28.060
relieve yourself of pain or to,
to,
to fend off him and a death.

552
00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:32.380
I don't believe that's any bureaucrats business but yours.

553
00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:35.860
You may make a decision different than differently than I do,

554
00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:39.160
but so what we all have different tastes.
We all have different preferences,

555
00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:40.780
preference,
we all have different tolerances.

556
00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:43.510
I don't believe that it's the government's position to say,
no,
no,
no.

557
00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:45.760
Your preference for risk is too great.

558
00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:50.500
We're not going to let you take this experimental drug because we think it might

559
00:31:50.501 --> 00:31:51.040
hurt you.

560
00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:54.880
I don't see that it's the government's business at all at your business.
Right.

561
00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:57.130
And you better get as educated as possible.

562
00:31:57.131 --> 00:31:59.730
I mean this is where I would say it comes down to education and,
but,

563
00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:01.720
but who has a better incentive to,

564
00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:05.980
to become informed and educated on the matter then you,
it's your life.
Yeah.

565
00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:10.570
Right.
And uh,
uh,
uh,
yes,
you can tell stories.
Well,
you know,
maybe you won't,

566
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:12.460
but I can tell stories too.
Well,

567
00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:15.610
how do you know that this bureaucrat over here is going to do as good a job?

568
00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:19.980
I'm willing to bet that you are much less likely to,
to,
to be,
uh,

569
00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:21.043
uh,

570
00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:27.190
less careful with your life then this guy or gal is with your life.
Yeah.

571
00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:30.250
All right.
So since you said it was a long game and I know how much high tech has

572
00:32:30.251 --> 00:32:33.760
influenced you and you write@cafehyatt.com.
Um,
let's see,

573
00:32:33.761 --> 00:32:34.840
what are the ideas of how I got,

574
00:32:34.841 --> 00:32:36.580
I know we've actually explored a lot of them here,

575
00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:39.920
but if there was something that,
uh,
I told you before that a lot of my audience,

576
00:32:39.921 --> 00:32:43.310
they go out and they,
they get books after and they start reading on all of this.

577
00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:47.090
What are some of the ideas of high tech that you'd like to impart?

578
00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:48.760
That I would touch on?

579
00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:54.390
That society is vastly more complex than we understand it to be particularly,

580
00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:59.150
uh,
uh,
a market oriented global society.
You know,

581
00:32:59.151 --> 00:33:02.450
we talk about and be terms talking about the labor market,
uh,

582
00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:07.460
the amount of trade,
you know,
the,
the GDP numbers,

583
00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:12.730
all these terms and numbers mask enormous underlying complexities.

584
00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:19.330
All the action that makes our society work is done at the local level.

585
00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:24.080
Uh,
and that,
that's a core hierarchy and insight.

586
00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:27.560
And if you start acting at this at the,
at the higher level,

587
00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:32.390
the risk is that that you will stamp out,
you'll,

588
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:37.610
you'll still stomp out,
you'll smother these,
uh,

589
00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:41.060
individual adjustments at the local level that actually bumped,

590
00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:44.210
whose consequences bubble up to the top to make it all work.

591
00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:48.410
There's a great hike.
He's not the most quotable of,
of guys,

592
00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:51.890
but it's a great hire quotation.
I'm not going to get it exactly right,

593
00:33:51.891 --> 00:33:56.891
but it goes something like the curious task of the economist is to,

594
00:33:57.250 --> 00:33:58.220
uh,
uh,

595
00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:03.250
remind men of how little they know about what they imagine they can create.

596
00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:07.730
Right?
So,
you know,
we can imagine Bernie Sanders imagines,

597
00:34:07.731 --> 00:34:11.840
he can create a world of everybody gets paid at least $15 an hour.
Uh,

598
00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:12.501
there's other people.

599
00:34:12.501 --> 00:34:15.740
Imagine they can create a world in which in which no one is,

600
00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:20.580
it dies because of,
you know,
a drug overdose or,
uh,
well,

601
00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:24.140
well,
you can't create that world.
It's far too complex.
And that's the,

602
00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:26.930
that's the critical hierarchy.
And inside the world's really complex.

603
00:34:26.931 --> 00:34:28.040
And therefore,
if it truly complex,

604
00:34:28.041 --> 00:34:31.850
we want to devolve decision making authority down to the lowest possible level

605
00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:36.790
and not have people who are slathered in Hubris,
uh,
uh,

606
00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:40.220
making decisions for those of us on the ground.
On that note,

607
00:34:40.221 --> 00:34:43.160
I think you're an excellent communicator of those ideas and that that's what

608
00:34:43.161 --> 00:34:46.820
it's all about,
right.
And it's reciprocated.
Yeah.
Thank you very much.
