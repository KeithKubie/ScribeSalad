00:00:00.938 --> 00:00:04.389
- When Marie Curie shared the
1903 Nobel Prize for Physics

00:00:04.389 --> 00:00:06.423
with two other scientists,

00:00:06.423 --> 00:00:09.983
her husband Pierre Curie
and Henri Becquerel,

00:00:09.983 --> 00:00:13.315
she had been the first
woman to win the prize,

00:00:13.315 --> 00:00:15.283
or maybe we have no error.

00:00:15.283 --> 00:00:18.484
So what feels a little
fishy is this had been,

00:00:18.484 --> 00:00:20.763
this had been right over here.

00:00:20.763 --> 00:00:23.399
We're referring to a
specific moment in the past.

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:27.963
When Marie Curie shared
the 1903 Nobel Prize.

00:00:27.963 --> 00:00:30.723
So if we're speaking a
specific moment in the past,

00:00:30.723 --> 00:00:35.003
so if this is the
present, this is the now,

00:00:35.003 --> 00:00:37.998
and we're speaking about a
specific moment in the past,

00:00:37.998 --> 00:00:40.383
if that is the past right over there,

00:00:40.383 --> 00:00:42.703
you would just use the simple past tense.

00:00:42.703 --> 00:00:44.123
So instead of saying she had been,

00:00:44.123 --> 00:00:46.423
you would just say she was.

00:00:46.423 --> 00:00:48.598
She was the first woman to win the prize.

00:00:48.598 --> 00:00:51.112
Let's read that without
this little clause here.

00:00:51.112 --> 00:00:53.926
When Marie Curie shared
the 1903 Nobel Prize

00:00:53.926 --> 00:00:56.543
for Physics with two other scientists,

00:00:56.543 --> 00:01:00.345
she was the first woman to win the prize.

00:01:00.345 --> 00:01:01.823
Yeah, that sounds right.

00:01:01.823 --> 00:01:04.352
So the error right over here is C.

00:01:04.352 --> 00:01:07.883
You would use had been, that's
actually the past perfect.

00:01:07.883 --> 00:01:12.883
You kind of throw that had before the verb

00:01:13.303 --> 00:01:15.284
to make the past perfect

00:01:15.284 --> 00:01:16.903
when you're talking about
something that happened

00:01:16.903 --> 00:01:18.946
before something in the past.

00:01:18.946 --> 00:01:23.946
So you could say, before I ate lunch,

00:01:24.103 --> 00:01:27.298
I had washed the car.

00:01:27.298 --> 00:01:29.230
So you would use that past perfect to say,

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.338
look, I washed my car before

00:01:31.338 --> 00:01:32.770
I did something else in the past,

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.298
before I actually ate my lunch.

00:01:36.298 --> 00:01:37.843
But here we're not talking about

00:01:37.843 --> 00:01:40.890
her doing something before
something in the past.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.523
We're talking about
something that's happening

00:01:42.523 --> 00:01:44.683
in an exact moment in the past.

00:01:44.683 --> 00:01:46.949
When she won the Nobel Prize,

00:01:46.949 --> 00:01:50.283
she was the first woman to win the prize.

00:01:50.283 --> 00:01:52.663
So the error here is in C.
