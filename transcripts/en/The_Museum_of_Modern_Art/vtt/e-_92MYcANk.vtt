00:00:00.242 --> 00:00:04.978
(bees buzz)

00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:13.388
- [Wolfgang] Pollen is the
essence of the flowers.

00:00:13.714 --> 00:00:15.465
It's the potential beginning.

00:00:15.465 --> 00:00:17.600
It's the male seed for the flowers.

00:00:17.968 --> 00:00:21.180
(bees buzz)

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.398
Without pollen, there is no plant.

00:00:30.013 --> 00:00:35.013
(wind rushes through trees)

00:00:36.528 --> 00:00:39.998
I collected the first pollen in 1977.

00:00:42.492 --> 00:00:44.245
Since that time,

00:00:44.245 --> 00:00:46.747
from early spring until early summer

00:00:46.747 --> 00:00:48.114
I was always here

00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:50.083
and collected the pollen

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:51.885
just around this small village.

00:00:53.211 --> 00:00:57.934
(birds chirp)

00:00:58.842 --> 00:01:03.842
(steps crunch softly)

00:01:05.724 --> 00:01:10.701
(rustling and soft scraping)

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.420
I love this work.

00:01:30.584 --> 00:01:33.376
It's something which I
do for hours and hours

00:01:33.376 --> 00:01:34.761
and days and days.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.300
It's a very quiet work,

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.260
here in this environment

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.853
which means a lot to me.

00:01:45.222 --> 00:01:50.222
(soft scraping)

00:02:03.782 --> 00:02:06.251
Here we have a different jars of pollen.

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:11.832
This is the dandelion pollen,

00:02:11.832 --> 00:02:14.717
which I actually collected
this spring, in May.

00:02:15.293 --> 00:02:16.707
You see it's not much.

00:02:16.707 --> 00:02:19.264
But it took me about three weeks at least.

00:02:20.924 --> 00:02:24.464
(soft tapping)

00:02:26.805 --> 00:02:28.974
(soft metallic tapping)

00:02:28.974 --> 00:02:30.309
Many people always ask me,

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:32.110
"How did you get this idea?"

00:02:32.936 --> 00:02:34.145
I think it's not an idea

00:02:34.145 --> 00:02:36.403
which you have on an afternoon or so.

00:02:36.403 --> 00:02:37.365
I think it's ...

00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:40.994
If I look back, it's the ...

00:02:41.862 --> 00:02:44.501
intense experience

00:02:44.501 --> 00:02:47.208
of studying six years medicine

00:02:48.118 --> 00:02:49.753
and seeing the hospitals,

00:02:50.245 --> 00:02:51.588
seeing sick people,

00:02:52.914 --> 00:02:54.591
experiencing death.

00:02:55.217 --> 00:02:57.669
Then, of course, this
has to do all with life,

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:00.717
pollen as the beginning of life,

00:03:00.717 --> 00:03:01.727
I think.

00:03:02.591 --> 00:03:04.634
I think it was the answer to all

00:03:04.634 --> 00:03:07.279
what I had seen before that.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.183
This pollen's just the concentration

00:03:12.183 --> 00:03:14.360
of all this 27 years.

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:21.401
The essence of all your experience

00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:23.453
is coming into an artwork.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.281
It is as simple as that,

00:03:26.281 --> 00:03:28.666
but also as complicated as that.

00:03:35.957 --> 00:03:40.957
(traffic rushing, honking)

00:03:59.064 --> 00:04:01.324
(soft splashing)

00:04:32.555 --> 00:04:37.198
(traffic, honking, and other city noises)

00:04:41.398 --> 00:04:43.576
When I work, I want to be totally alone

00:04:43.576 --> 00:04:46.204
and I don't want to have
any other influence.

00:04:46.486 --> 00:04:48.613
That is the sense that I work in Germany

00:04:48.613 --> 00:04:50.198
outside of a small village,

00:04:50.198 --> 00:04:52.409
and in India outside of a small village,

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:53.827
totally for myself.

00:04:53.827 --> 00:04:55.578
I always found it a luxury

00:04:55.578 --> 00:04:58.084
to make my work totally alone,

00:04:58.084 --> 00:05:01.175
but to show it in the
biggest cities of the world.

00:05:19.602 --> 00:05:23.064
People know me as making
something this year

00:05:23.064 --> 00:05:25.867
like the same thing which
I made 30 years ago.

00:05:27.402 --> 00:05:29.704
Not many others have
the courage to do that.

00:05:32.198 --> 00:05:33.825
For me, that was very important,

00:05:33.825 --> 00:05:36.380
but that I would collect the same pollen

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.801
this year like 30 years ago.

00:05:38.801 --> 00:05:42.042
I find that's a very,
very important statement

00:05:42.042 --> 00:05:45.720
in this world, where everything
has to change every second.

00:05:57.182 --> 00:06:01.352
(soft tapping)

00:06:01.352 --> 00:06:02.562
Art, in the long run,

00:06:02.562 --> 00:06:05.698
gives the most to all
the people in the world.

00:06:07.942 --> 00:06:09.736
I feel the pollen piece

00:06:09.736 --> 00:06:11.704
is much more important than me.

00:06:14.115 --> 00:06:19.003
(soft, rhythmic metallic tapping)

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:39.558
In this space here,

00:06:39.558 --> 00:06:43.978
I find so incredible that
it's the center of the museum

00:06:43.978 --> 00:06:46.114
and it goes through all the floors.

00:06:46.523 --> 00:06:48.733
You can see it from the different angles

00:06:48.733 --> 00:06:50.827
from the different floors down.

00:06:54.155 --> 00:06:55.824
This concept of a center

00:06:55.824 --> 00:06:58.559
in such a big building

00:06:58.559 --> 00:07:00.287
I find something very beautiful

00:07:00.287 --> 00:07:02.506
and very intense and concentrated.

00:07:04.124 --> 00:07:09.124
(metallic tapping echoes)

00:07:20.431 --> 00:07:22.642
It is very rare that you
can see a pollen piece

00:07:22.642 --> 00:07:24.193
from so far above.

00:07:24.727 --> 00:07:27.355
And that was always very
beautiful, this distance,

00:07:28.908 --> 00:07:30.319
like you are looking down,

00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:32.201
not into hell but into heaven.

00:07:32.735 --> 00:07:37.735
(rhythmic tapping continues)

00:08:15.534 --> 00:08:16.618
It's done.
