00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.360
The final type of classic mistakes that I want

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.470
to mention are technology related mistakes. One typical mistake

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.990
in this context is the silver-bullet syndrome. What does

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.340
that mean? Well, the silver-bullet syndrome refers to situations

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.900
in which there is too much reliance on the

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.950
advertised benefits of some previously unused technology. For example,

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.980
a new technology. And the problem here is that

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.140
we cannot expect technology alone to solve our software

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.810
development issues. So we should not rely too

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.020
much on technology alone. Another typical mistake is to

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.700
switch or add tools in the middle of

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.010
a project. And sometimes it can make sense to

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.620
upgrade a tool, but introducing new tools, which

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.650
can have a steep learning curve, has almost always

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.290
negative effects. Finally, a common unforgivable mistake is

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.230
the lack of an automated version control system for

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.480
your code and for your various artifacts. Manual and

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.700
ad hoc solutions are just not an option. It is

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.270
way too easy to make mistakes, use out of

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.600
date versions, be unable to find a previous working version,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.030
and so on. I saw that happening many times,

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.640
and it always results in a disaster. So be warned,

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.650
use a version control system and an automated one. And

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.750
actually we will use version control systems in our projects.
