00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:07.830
When I was a student here, I volunteered for
Recording for the Blind, which had its offices

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.090
over in the Princeton Seminary and I would
walk over there about twice a month.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.410
They had me become a monitor rather than a
reader, because they decided that my voice

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.040
wasn't particularly good for conveying expression
in the reading.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.420
So my job was mainly to watch as somebody
else read, and make sure they didn't drop

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.110
a word along the way.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.020
After I left Princeton and started my profession
career, a lot of my service ended up being

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.450
of a different variety.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.310
When somebody asked me to serve on a committee,
I would always agree.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:45.500
I'd look for opportunities to do things like
serving on nonprofit boards or commissions,

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.670
and I think there's a connection between these
things that's important for all Princetonians

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.060
as they move into their careers.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:58.060
And the question is all about asking, how
can I help and how can I contribute to my

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.060
community?

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.739
And that for me is why it's so important for
service to be a part of the student experience

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:04.610
here at Princeton.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.020
I believe that Princetonians, as they move
on into the world, are going to contribute

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.280
and perform kinds of service in all sorts
of different vocations.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:18.050
But I think it all starts with that question
about how can I help, and how can I make a

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.050
difference.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.572
So for me, that's why "Princeton in the nation's
service" begins with the service that our

00:01:22.572 --> 00:01:24.570
students do while they're here on campus.
