00:00:00.938 --> 00:00:02.814
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:11.640
GREG ESTREN: Welcome
to 111 Eighth Avenue.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.950
I know most of you are already
quite familiar with this place.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.301
It's Google's New York
City headquarters,

00:00:17.301 --> 00:00:19.550
and somewhere you probably
spend an awful large amount

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.890
of your time every day.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.384
It's a gigantic,
bustling building,

00:00:26.384 --> 00:00:29.460
filling an entire
block of Lower Chelsea,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.130
and sporting sweeping views
of the midtown skyline

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.050
to the north, the
financial district,

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.300
and upper New York
Bay to the south,

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.741
and vast expanses of the
Hudson River just to the west.

00:00:43.741 --> 00:00:45.240
It has one of the
largest footprints

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.760
of any building in Manhattan.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.129
It's 16 stories high.

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.920
It was the second-largest
building on Earth

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.420
when it was originally built.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.410
120,000 yards of concrete.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.070
31,000 tons of steel.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.819
12 million bricks.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:07.870
Four acres of glass.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.510
It's still one of the largest
buildings in New York City,

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.209
a skyscraper laid
on its side, bigger

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:16.500
than the Empire State Building.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.664
This is clearly a curious
and unique building.

00:01:23.664 --> 00:01:25.830
There's nothing else quite
like it here in the city.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.560
And it's obviously a
successful, vibrant home

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.950
to at least one major internet
tech company of the modern era.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.838
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.916
But why does it say "Port of New
York Authority" on both sides?

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.240
What does "inland
terminal number one" mean?

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.080
Why are there bumpers
lining the walls

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.726
down 15th and 16th Street?

00:01:52.726 --> 00:01:53.521
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:53.521 --> 00:01:54.520
It's a serious question.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.620
Why is the 15th floor elevator
lobby so different and nice?

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.838
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:06.422 --> 00:02:08.130
Why are none of the
neighboring buildings

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.310
anything like this one?

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.950
Just what is this place, anyway?

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.510
Why was it built on
this block in Chelsea?

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.616
Why is it so big?

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:26.780
Why is it even here?

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.700
The story of this building
is first and foremost

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:43.990
the story of this-- 1,500 square
miles of raw earth and water,

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.090
nestled away in a little
corner of the Atlantic Ocean.

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.430
771 miles of waterfront.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.840
Over eight bays, four rivers,
four straits, 17 counties,

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.720
200 municipalities, and
one major world city.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.150
It would take a 10-knot
boat about eight days

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.375
to navigate the entire thing,
assuming they're not navigating

00:03:09.375 --> 00:03:13.100
in the middle of the night.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.750
This is the port of New York.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.210
It's an enormously
rich resource.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.710
Four times the size
of Boston's port,

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.200
six times the size of
Baltimore's, 20 times the size

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.720
of Philadelphia's, and it's
the foundation on which New

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.810
York was built. It's the
reason this city was created,

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.920
why it grew in the
way that it did,

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.330
and why it's the big
metropolis it is today.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.780
Before the Industrial
Revolution,

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.420
New York was a very different
city than it is today.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.640
In particular, transportation
was absolutely abysmal.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.560
If you wanted to get
somewhere by land,

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.000
basically, you would have
to take a stagecoach,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.770
maybe take a horse, or most
likely, walk over dirt,

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.660
rocky, gravel-ish roads
through the woods.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.410
We didn't have roads
like we have today.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.229
It wasn't particularly
pleasant or fast.

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:11.770
Getting from New
York to Boston might

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.890
take about six days' time.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.751
So in this period,
everything moved by water.

00:04:16.751 --> 00:04:17.959
Boats were a really big deal.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.710
Oceans, bays, and rivers--
that's how things moved around.

00:04:23.867 --> 00:04:25.450
And the bays in New
York in particular

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.263
were attractive to settling
the city in the first place.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.280
But come the 19th century,
all of this started to change.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.905
As a part of the
Industrial Revolution,

00:04:35.905 --> 00:04:37.670
there was a sort of
sub-piece of that,

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.380
known as the
Transportation Revolution.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.480
And it massively
changed the country,

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.350
leading it into the
modern country and economy

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.024
that we know today.

00:04:47.024 --> 00:04:49.190
In particular, at the
beginning of the 19th century,

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.670
there were two
critical innovations

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.040
that had big impacts.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.731
One of them was the
steamship pictured here.

00:04:55.731 --> 00:04:57.980
Someone finally figured out
how to take a steam engine

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.725
and put it on a
boat, which meant now

00:05:00.725 --> 00:05:03.350
boats could travel upstream just
as easily as they could travel

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:04.950
downstream.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.990
It sounds kind of simple, but
that absolutely revolutionized

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.550
transportation and the economy
in the country, and the world.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.820
This was used in
conjunction with canals,

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.210
which were used to create
waterways into the interior,

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.170
so it was possible to start
settling and creating economies

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.130
outside of the ocean
and waterfronts.

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.210
In particular,
there was one canal

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.220
that had massive, massive
impact on the country,

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.660
and that was the Erie Canal.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.417
It was started
in, I think, 1824,

00:05:36.417 --> 00:05:38.250
and it connected New
York City with Buffalo.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.435
As soon as it opened, the time
for traveling between Buffalo

00:05:46.435 --> 00:05:49.210
and New York cut by
about half, and the cost

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.910
of moving goods and
freight plummeted by 95%.

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.690
It basically put the
Midwest on the map,

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.100
and massively expanded
the size of the country,

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.200
and created an economy
which linked the Midwest,

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.600
and linked the Northeast, and
then with Europe on beyond.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.750
And New York City was at
the center of all of this.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.570
This was the era that New York
really came into preeminence.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.860
This was the era that New York
vaulted beyond Philadelphia

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.910
to become the country's
preeminent city.

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.020
But it's these guys that had
the biggest impact of them all.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.130
It's these guys who
were more responsible

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.270
than probably any kind of
technological innovation,

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:30.811
or definitely form
of transportation,

00:06:30.811 --> 00:06:32.780
to create the modern
country that we know.

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.940
Someone finally figured out
how to make land travel viable,

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.910
and that absolutely plummeted
the amount of time and cost

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.880
that it took to move all
throughout the country.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.199
This is most famously evidenced
by the Transcontinental

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:46.490
Railroad, which literally
stitched together the country

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:47.340
from coast to coast.

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.599
It ended up producing
an economy that

00:06:54.599 --> 00:06:56.265
was on a larger scale
than anything that

00:06:56.265 --> 00:06:58.349
had been seen before
in this country,

00:06:58.349 --> 00:06:59.890
and a country that's
literally larger

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:01.160
than it had ever been before.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.690
And New York continued
to be the center of this.

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.827
Those trading routes
established by the Erie Canal

00:07:04.827 --> 00:07:06.410
continued to be used
by the railroads,

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:08.320
and by the end of
the 19th century,

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.947
New York ended up bigger,
more important, busier,

00:07:11.947 --> 00:07:13.155
than it had ever been before.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.550
This was the era of
the mighty railroads,

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:22.210
of the New York Central
and the Pennsylvania.

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:25.600
It was the era of the
Vanderbilts, Grand Central

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.410
Station, and the
original Penn Station.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:29.550
Big stuff happening then.

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:36.397
But by the time the 20th
century came around,

00:07:36.397 --> 00:07:37.938
this was starting
to create problems.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.940
New York was bigger than ever.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.630
76 million tons of
freight was moving by rail

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:53.004
through the city, over three
million railroad cars per year.

00:07:53.004 --> 00:07:54.670
There was more
manufacturing in New York

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:58.330
than Philadelphia,
Chicago, Cleveland, and St.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.117
Louis combined.

00:08:01.117 --> 00:08:02.950
About half of the
country's foreign commerce

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:04.570
moved just through
this single port.

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:08.770
It was by far the largest port
in the country, an operating

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:11.580
level of unprecedented scale.

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.890
Now, this sounds all
fantastic and wonderful.

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:15.732
This doesn't sound
like a problem.

00:08:15.732 --> 00:08:17.190
But the problem
was, it was finally

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:20.040
hitting a point-- this
port is big, it's rich,

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:24.370
it's an enormous resource,
but it's not infinitely big.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:28.022
And it's finally starting to
hit its limit of scalability.

00:08:28.022 --> 00:08:29.980
It never developed in
any kind of coherent way.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.100
It was always
basically a land grab

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:35.214
when the steamships, and
eventually the railroads,

00:08:35.214 --> 00:08:35.880
built into here.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.010
It was just private companies
competing with each other,

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:40.468
angling with each other to try
to make a buck over another.

00:08:40.468 --> 00:08:45.690
Which means that there was no
consolidated use of this port,

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:47.447
and at this level of
scale and economy,

00:08:47.447 --> 00:08:49.530
it was really starting to
reach the limits of what

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:50.238
could be handled.

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:58.180
New York, in particular,
had three disadvantages

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.177
that were a real problem
for it by this point.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.490
First, it's a city of islands.

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:07.200
You could be an
orange manufacturer,

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.267
orange grower-- probably
not from an orange factory--

00:09:10.267 --> 00:09:10.850
in California.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:12.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:13.249 --> 00:09:13.790
I don't know.

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:17.120
Who knows how it went back then.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.600
You can load your oranges
up onto a railroad car,

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.840
transport them through
the Rocky Mountains,

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.300
through the plains of
the Midwest, thousands

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.600
and thousands of miles, all the
way through the entire country,

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.500
only to get stuck on
the New Jersey Shore.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:35.690
One small but big enough river
away from the actual city.

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:36.649
This is a real problem.

00:09:36.649 --> 00:09:37.731
What do you do about this?

00:09:37.731 --> 00:09:39.437
At this level of
scale, how do you

00:09:39.437 --> 00:09:41.020
move all of this
stuff this last mile?

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.600
And at this point, there were no
tunnels or bridges or anything

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.766
that could accommodate this.

00:09:44.766 --> 00:09:46.510
And there kind of
still aren't today.

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:49.709
Not for freight, at least.

00:09:49.709 --> 00:09:51.375
So what did the
railroads do about this?

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.710
Well, they put their
railroad cars onto boats.

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:02.940
They ended up having a massive
amount of transfer stations

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.761
and terminals on
the New Jersey side,

00:10:04.761 --> 00:10:07.010
where they would take these
specially-made barges that

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:10.560
had rail cars on them, put the
railroad cars onto the barges,

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.082
float them across
the Hudson River,

00:10:12.082 --> 00:10:13.540
and then transfer
them to receiving

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:16.040
points on Manhattan, where they
could finally be dealt with,

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.920
received over in the city.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:22.110
These were called car floats,
and they were a critical link

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:24.660
in which freight moved into and
out of the city in this time.

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:32.550
The other problem that
New York had was this

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:35.330
is a very fragmented network.

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:36.972
These mighty
railroads of the time,

00:10:36.972 --> 00:10:38.680
they were independent
companies, and they

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.414
were competing with each other.

00:10:40.414 --> 00:10:41.580
There were about 12 of them.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.580
It looks a little bit
different in this diagram.

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:45.452
It says 11, but
the numbers varied.

00:10:45.452 --> 00:10:47.910
There were 12 of them serving
the city, of which about nine

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:50.947
of them ended up on
the side of New Jersey.

00:10:50.947 --> 00:10:53.280
And there were a few other
tracks in a few other places.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.939
But these were
different companies

00:10:56.939 --> 00:10:58.730
competing with each
other, and they did not

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:00.050
share infrastructure.

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:05.050
So what that meant was that
all this infrastructure--

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:10.630
railroads, stations, piers,
ferries, tugboats, lighters,

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:13.830
car floats, motor trucks,
warehouses, and markets-- was

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:15.940
duplicated 12 times.

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.025
This was not efficient.

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:23.290
And then, the third
problem that New York had

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:25.040
was a simple political one.

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:28.330
This is one big,
natural, unified port,

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:30.270
but it's politically
split in two.

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:34.480
On this side, you had
the State of New Jersey.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.825
And on this side, the
State of New York.

00:11:37.825 --> 00:11:39.700
And they didn't always
agree with each other,

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:44.252
so it wasn't always easy to
work on these situations,

00:11:44.252 --> 00:11:45.335
get the political will to.

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:52.400
So the practical
consequences of this,

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.620
was that it was enormously
expensive to ship stuff

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.200
to and from New York.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:00.920
It was enormously expensive
to bridge that last mile.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.650
It was stated that
it cost just as much

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:06.020
to take freight from
Buffalo to New York

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:09.680
as it did to cross the
Hudson River itself.

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.210
And even worse, because
these railroads,

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:14.322
they all had their own
proprietary networks--

00:12:14.322 --> 00:12:16.030
a rail belonged to
one company and didn't

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:18.646
belong to another company--
you got some absurd

00:12:18.646 --> 00:12:19.396
routing scenarios.

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:27.530
So here's an example where
somebody was shipping freight.

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:29.990
I don't remember
the kind of freight.

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:32.790
But they were shipping
from basically Jersey

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:33.997
City to Jersey City.

00:12:33.997 --> 00:12:36.330
And you can see where the
origin and the destination is.

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:38.544
There's about, I think,
a four mile difference.

00:12:38.544 --> 00:12:40.960
But because of the way the
tracks were owned and laid out,

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.140
it actually shipped
over 58 miles, over,

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:47.137
I think, four days to
get to its destination.

00:12:47.137 --> 00:12:48.720
The railroads who
shipped, they wanted

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.640
to maximize the amount of time
this stuff was on their rails,

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.294
because they made
more money doing that.

00:12:54.294 --> 00:12:55.960
Sometimes they just
got stupidly absurd.

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:02.842
This is 180 miles.

00:13:02.842 --> 00:13:04.550
And then another
consequence of all this,

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:06.950
which is all this
duplicated infrastructure

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:09.560
created a lot of wasted space.

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.400
50% of New Jersey's
waterfront was

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:16.340
used by railroad yards,
and 43 piers on Manhattan.

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:18.810
This was considered an
enormous waste of space.

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:21.390
It was much preferred to
use piers for shipping,

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:24.250
and passenger liners,
and that sort of thing,

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:28.620
as opposed to unnecessary
railroad infrastructure.

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:30.246
And of course,
Manhattan's west side,

00:13:30.246 --> 00:13:32.370
with all this infrastructure
on the Manhattan side,

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:33.765
was congested beyond belief.

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:39.380
Every railroad had their own
receiving stations and delivery

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:39.946
stations.

00:13:39.946 --> 00:13:41.320
And merchant trucks
from the city

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.400
would have to come to them,
and fill up the streets,

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.560
and load cars on the streets.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.476
And there was congestion
and waste everywhere.

00:13:46.476 --> 00:13:49.120
And the whole west side-- we're
in this west side, kind of--

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.161
was basically a disaster.

00:13:53.220 --> 00:14:01.260
And it wasn't just
economic concerns

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.870
about New York that
were the problems here.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:06.190
There were actually
national security concerns

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:08.430
for the security of
the entire country.

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:10.680
This really came to a head
in World War I. World War

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:13.960
I ended up giving
the port more usage

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:17.030
than it ever had in
history, as the United

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:20.680
States was trying to apply
the war effort over in Europe.

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:24.560
And what happened is the
port couldn't handle it.

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:28.660
There were railroad cars backed
up all the way to Buffalo.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:31.201
They ultimately had to divert
traffic to other ports,

00:14:31.201 --> 00:14:32.950
like Philadelphia and
Boston, because they

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:34.325
couldn't handle
all the load that

00:14:34.325 --> 00:14:35.850
was going through the port.

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:38.030
In 1917, the government
even temporarily

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:40.055
nationalized the railroad
network in New York,

00:14:40.055 --> 00:14:41.930
in order to make this
stuff work efficiently.

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:43.000
This was basically a crisis.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.030
This was a system that
was not scaling, and was

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:49.060
starting to fall apart
in a time of real need.

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:50.890
And that was a real concern.

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:55.400
Things were not well in
the port of New York.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.310
And then finally, all these
things coming together,

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:02.580
this created this concern
that New York, preeminent

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:04.110
as it was, this
wasn't guaranteed it

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:04.860
was going to last.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:05.624
It might slip.

00:15:05.624 --> 00:15:06.790
And this wasn't just theory.

00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:07.873
This wasn't just paranoia.

00:15:07.873 --> 00:15:10.110
This was actually happening.

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:13.270
Since 1890, New York's share
of the commerce of the country

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:15.150
was starting to slip.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:16.930
And other ports were
very aware of this,

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:18.971
and they were fighting
very aggressively in order

00:15:18.971 --> 00:15:21.580
to get their share that
New York couldn't handle.

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:23.330
There was very serious
concern about this,

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:25.195
the future of New
York if they couldn't

00:15:25.195 --> 00:15:26.153
get their act together.

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:34.360
World War I, that
experience with World War I,

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:38.740
was a huge wake-up call for the
area that things were not well.

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:40.460
But it took an even
more immediate crisis

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:44.220
to actually trigger
the will for change.

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:46.900
This happened about 1915, and it
was called the New York Harbor

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:48.080
Crisis.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.250
Basically, New
Jersey was looking

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.180
at this situation
like, OK, yeah,

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:54.090
it's really expensive
to do all this stuff,

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:57.370
and have these car floats, and
all these duplicated stations,

00:15:57.370 --> 00:16:00.820
and all this extra effort it
takes to get to Manhattan.

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:03.901
But why is that New
Jersey's problem?

00:16:03.901 --> 00:16:05.400
You can get to New
Jersey just fine.

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.160
You don't have to cross any
rivers to get to New Jersey.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.190
Why should it cost as
much to ship to New Jersey

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:10.460
as it does to New York?

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:14.110
It's a fair question.

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:16.450
So New Jersey filed a
petition with the ICC.

00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:20.891
Without getting in much detail,
the ICC was a federal agency.

00:16:20.891 --> 00:16:23.140
They set the rates of how
much it cost to ship things.

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:25.080
If you're going to
ship cotton to Boston,

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:27.900
it will cost you
like five cents.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:31.509
And they existed for a large
part of the 20th century.

00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:32.300
They decided rates.

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:34.730
So New Jersey filed a
petition with the ICC,

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:38.860
asking for cheaper rates to
New Jersey than to New York.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.430
What that meant in
practice was they

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:43.180
wanted to split up the port.

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:45.322
And that was really
scary to a lot of people.

00:16:45.322 --> 00:16:46.760
It wasn't clear
what would happen

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:47.870
if you split up the port.

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:49.342
Maybe it would help New Jersey.

00:16:49.342 --> 00:16:51.050
Maybe industry would
just leave outright,

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:52.383
and things would get much worse.

00:16:55.590 --> 00:17:00.580
The ICC ultimately ruled
against New Jersey.

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:02.580
They decided that the
significance of this being

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:05.980
a unified port is
important and meaningful,

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:08.359
and it's not a really
good idea to split it up.

00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:09.790
But they did issue a warning.

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:14.380
They said, yes, your point,
New Jersey, is valid.

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:16.020
Things are not well here.

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:18.650
If you guys don't get
your act together,

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:23.270
we may change our
mind later, and we

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:27.410
may make a different decision.

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:30.130
What this meant was
that the status quo

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:31.450
was no longer an option.

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:33.460
There were only two
choices at this point,

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:39.090
just after World War
I-- fix this port,

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:40.210
or break up this port.

00:17:43.692 --> 00:17:45.192
That's what they
had to choose from.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:51.530
So what the states did is
they appointed a commission.

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:56.090
It was a bi-state commission
run by both states.

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:59.130
It was called the New York,
New Jersey Port and Harbor

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:00.260
Development Commission.

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.950
And they were tasked in
1917 with, basically,

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:05.140
looking at the situation
and figuring out

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.714
what to do about it.

00:18:07.714 --> 00:18:10.130
They did an exhaustive study
of the port over three years.

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:13.140
It was the most exhaustive
study of this port ever done.

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:16.160
And ultimately, it
provided a 495-page report,

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:20.290
which had a recommended
plan of what to do,

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:22.210
and the structure for
a regional authority

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:24.085
that would be empowered
to execute that plan.

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:29.790
This regional authority is
what became the Port Authority.

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:32.080
It was started
just a year later.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.870
They were an amazingly
innovative and controversial

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:37.200
political structure,
in way more detail

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.744
than I can get into right now.

00:18:38.744 --> 00:18:40.910
But the gist of it is they're
an organization that's

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:42.770
owned by both New
York and New Jersey.

00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:44.100
Both states own it.

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:48.200
And they're empowered
to make improvements

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:51.099
from a holistic perspective over
the port region, that satellite

00:18:51.099 --> 00:18:52.140
image that we saw before.

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.900
The plan that this
commission came up with

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:58.640
was called the
Comprehensive Plan,

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.530
and it was basically a
fundamental reorganization

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:05.060
of the region's transportation
railroad network,

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:08.060
focusing on unification,
de-duplicating all

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:11.705
this duplicated infrastructure,
rational planning, efficiency.

00:19:11.705 --> 00:19:13.080
Again, looking at
the whole thing

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:16.770
from a holistic perspective
for the health of the region.

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:21.430
So with that, New
York and New Jersey,

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:23.860
with ratification by
Congress and the President

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.620
of United States, allowed the
creation of the Port Authority

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:30.880
as an organization
in April 1921.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.340
They were seeded with
$100,000 of seed money,

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:34.850
and given eight
months to produce

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:38.795
a version of this plan
that could save New York.

00:19:44.077 --> 00:19:45.910
Let's take a look at
the Comprehensive Plan.

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:51.770
It looks like a mess, I know.

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:53.630
But the point of it is
to clean up the mess.

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:56.850
The basic gist of it
is, let anything easily

00:19:56.850 --> 00:19:58.750
get anywhere in the port.

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:01.760
Things like water, rivers,
bays, shouldn't be a barrier

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.052
towards things moving around.

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.530
So the core elements
of this were

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:12.502
to connect New Jersey
with Long Island,

00:20:12.502 --> 00:20:14.210
with Brooklyn and
Queens and Long Island.

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:17.290
You see a light blue
line running through.

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:19.251
The idea was to
create a special rail

00:20:19.251 --> 00:20:21.750
line which connects with all
the independent companies' rail

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:22.310
lines.

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:24.560
So stuff coming in from any
one private company's line

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.850
can connect to that line, run
through all of New Jersey,

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:30.700
run through a newly built tunnel
connecting Jersey City to Bay

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:34.020
Ridge or Brooklyn,
in the dark blue,

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:35.860
and then run up through
Brooklyn and Queens,

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:40.720
therefore connecting New
Jersey with Long Island.

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:42.800
As for Manhattan, the
problem with Manhattan

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.560
itself, it was a really
awesome proposal that they had.

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.190
It was really neat and crazy.

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:48.850
I'm going to go to the next
slide to zoom in a little bit,

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:50.724
because it's easier to
see in the next slide.

00:20:50.724 --> 00:20:52.900
They proposed, instead
of all these car floats,

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:56.970
creating this loop of an
auto-electrified rail system.

00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:58.730
Kind of like a
Disneyland People Mover.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:04.770
Railroad freight would transfer
from the New Jersey side

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:07.820
rail yards onto these
automatically moving cars,

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:10.990
go through a new tunnel
underneath the Hudson River,

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:13.770
deep into Manhattan, where
they would be deposited

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:17.639
into a series of inland
stations strategically

00:21:17.639 --> 00:21:19.680
placed throughout the
city, that would whisk them

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:23.200
up through elevators-- not
like elevators we have in here,

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.070
just to be clear--
but through elevators,

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:27.278
where they would do the
processing they needed to do.

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:34.540
In order to figure out how
many stations would be needed

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:36.290
and where they might
be in order to supply

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:41.010
the entirety of Manhattan,
they did some studies.

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:43.906
Over here is a study of the
freight density of Manhattan.

00:21:43.906 --> 00:21:45.280
Basically, each
one of those dots

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.130
represents a certain
amount of freight being

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:48.920
processed through the city.

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:53.650
So they plotted this onto
the map of Manhattan,

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:57.050
and then created
nine-ish different zones

00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:59.794
of equal freight density.

00:21:59.794 --> 00:22:01.460
And then, from those
zones, they decided

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:03.050
they would have one
terminal serving

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:04.190
each one of those zones.

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:06.020
So the idea of it was
it would kind of be

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:08.295
like a post office for freight.

00:22:08.295 --> 00:22:09.670
If you're a merchant
and you need

00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:11.954
to deliver freight,
rather than going

00:22:11.954 --> 00:22:13.370
to every single
different railroad

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:16.870
station's individual
depot station,

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:18.550
you would just go
to the terminal

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:20.350
that was serving your zone.

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:22.924
It would be inland, away
from the waterfront,

00:22:22.924 --> 00:22:25.340
which they wanted to use for
boats and that sort of thing.

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:27.214
And then, the Port
Authority would figure out

00:22:27.214 --> 00:22:28.840
how to get that
to the railroads,

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:32.470
through this
auto-electric system.

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:35.210
So this is basically the idea.

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:37.695
But they recognized
that some of this stuff

00:22:37.695 --> 00:22:38.820
would not happen overnight.

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.850
You can't just build
tunnels overnight.

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:43.710
And there was an immediate
crisis to be solved.

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:49.390
So they also came up with
a plan for present relief,

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:51.890
a limited version this which
they could execute immediately,

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:53.090
to get immediate effect.

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:55.256
And the idea that was,
basically, take all these car

00:22:55.256 --> 00:22:57.180
floats and consolidate them.

00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:59.340
And instead, use these
little courier trucks

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:01.130
which would pick up
on the New Jersey side

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:04.250
from the rail stations,
and then either get ferried

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:07.170
across the river, or maybe use
the newly built Holland Tunnel

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:08.530
which was getting created.

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:10.290
And then drive all the way
into these inland stations,

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:12.130
without the rail
connection, without needing

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:13.550
to build the tunnels.

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:16.585
And then build the
stations to support them.

00:23:16.585 --> 00:23:18.460
So that was the idea
for immediate execution.

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:20.960
And they took that idea, they
negotiated with the railroads,

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.501
and then they decided
they were going

00:23:22.501 --> 00:23:25.070
to focus all their efforts,
all their initial efforts,

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:28.846
into one single project-- the
Union Inland Terminal Number

00:23:28.846 --> 00:23:29.346
One.

00:23:42.687 --> 00:23:43.520
So they got to work.

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:47.020
They hired the architectural
firm of Abbott, Merkt &amp; Company

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:48.820
in order to prepare
the plans and start

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:49.910
building the buildings.

00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:53.210
The initial place they were
going to build it was not here.

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:56.166
It was in Zone 3W,
which is between Spring

00:23:56.166 --> 00:23:58.540
Street and Christopher Street,
just to the south of here.

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:05.440
The plan was to build a 206-foot
wide by 500-foot building.

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:09.496
The terminal would be the ground
floor and the basement only.

00:24:09.496 --> 00:24:10.870
On top of that,
everything on top

00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:12.980
would be 14 floors
of office space,

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:15.617
the point being that they could
rent out and then subsidize

00:24:15.617 --> 00:24:17.200
the cost of the
terminal, because this

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:18.500
had to be self-supporting.

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:22.120
They couldn't take taxpayer
dollars to support this.

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.150
So this was the plan.

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:26.710
They presented it
to the railroads,

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:29.010
and the railroad said, no.

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:33.650
Not big enough.

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:35.900
It's not going to handle all
the freight in this zone.

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:38.108
It's not going to be able
to serve all the railroads.

00:24:38.108 --> 00:24:40.382
But maybe even more
importantly, they

00:24:40.382 --> 00:24:41.840
didn't think the
location was fair.

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:45.180
If you look at this map here,
any of the black piers, those

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:49.700
are railroad piers, piers that
were owned by the railroads.

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:53.470
The original spot in 3W that
they were trying to plan for

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:57.770
was probably
somewhere around here,

00:24:57.770 --> 00:24:59.480
which meant that some
railroads already

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:01.030
had station facilities
around there,

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:03.170
and they didn't
think that was fair.

00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:05.050
It might disrupt the
competitive balance

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:06.340
of the different railroads.

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.781
So they were really
wary about that.

00:25:08.781 --> 00:25:11.030
So basically, they said, go
back to the drawing board,

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:12.680
give us something different.

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:14.510
The Port Authority did
that, and then they

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:15.551
suggested a new location.

00:25:15.551 --> 00:25:19.900
OK, we'll try Zone
4W, right around here.

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:21.650
That looks a lot more fair.

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:23.738
No railroad infrastructure
anywhere around there.

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:32.300
It would be an even
bigger terminal, too,

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:34.320
260 feet by 800 feet.

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.900
Could hold 100 merchant
trucks at a time.

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:38.900
And it would have these
amazing truck elevators,

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:40.900
so the tenants in
the upper levels,

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:42.590
they could get
store-door delivery

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:45.090
right to their storefront, even
if their storefront happened

00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:47.860
to be on the sixth floor
of the building, which

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:49.920
is really exciting.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:53.040
The exterior would be,
quote-unquote, "Simple,

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:55.292
inexpensive, but
dignified and pleasing."

00:25:55.292 --> 00:25:57.049
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:00.844 --> 00:26:02.510
So they presented
this to the railroads,

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:07.040
and the railroads said, OK.

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.470
However, this is not mandatory.

00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:10.890
We have our own stations.

00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:11.900
This works for us.

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:12.860
This is an experiment.

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:14.443
We don't know how
this is going to go,

00:26:14.443 --> 00:26:16.986
so we're not going to
be required to use this.

00:26:16.986 --> 00:26:18.360
It'll be an opt-in
kind of thing,

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:21.570
and we'll just do this as an
experiment and see how it goes.

00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:23.550
So the Port Authority said, OK.

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:25.800
And they signed a contract
with eight of the railroads

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:29.300
on August of 1930,
promising to have

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:32.030
this ready within 16 months.

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:35.330
And then, committing to
making two more of them

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:37.870
if requested-- if and when
requested by the railroads.

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:39.530
But you know, we'll see.

00:26:43.114 --> 00:26:44.530
So the Port Authority
got to work.

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.300
First off, of course, they
had to clear off the old site.

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:52.320
This was the city.

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:53.630
There was stuff on the blocks.

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:55.590
It wasn't empty fields.

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:57.680
So they went to work,
and ultimately they

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.670
had to purchase and raise about
73 buildings on this block

00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:04.660
between 15th and 16th Street,
Eighth and Ninth Avenue.

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:11.420
It included two garages,
a movie theater, a hotel,

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:14.010
a boy's club-- I don't even
know what that means, but--

00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:15.794
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:19.450
And maybe the coolest,
the five-story GB Seeley

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:20.830
carbonated beverage plant.

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:24.542
It was a soda manufacturer right
in the middle of the block,

00:27:24.542 --> 00:27:25.540
right around there.

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:32.032
And they were apparently pretty
well-known back in the day.

00:27:32.032 --> 00:27:33.740
They had a brand that
was known, and they

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:35.910
were a significant
manufacturer of soda,

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:38.118
before they were ultimately
bought out by Canada Dry.

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:45.715
Here is a picture of the site.

00:27:45.715 --> 00:27:50.080
That right there is the GB
Seeley factory, making soda,

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:52.196
probably halfway down
15th and 16th Streets.

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:59.664
This is the view on Eighth
Avenue between 15th and 16th.

00:27:59.664 --> 00:28:02.080
And you can see the Village
Theater right about two-thirds

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:02.857
of the way up.

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.905
This is looking at
15th Street west.

00:28:09.905 --> 00:28:11.696
You can see Chelsea
Market in the distance.

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:22.063
This is what Ninth
Avenue looked like.

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:41.668
Demolition began in 1931.

00:28:41.668 --> 00:28:58.494
The superstructure started
to rise in October of 1931.

00:28:58.494 --> 00:28:59.368
Pretty cool pictures.

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:04.250
On December of 1932,
the elevators--

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:06.500
these infamous truck
elevators-- they

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:09.180
had to move them in from
the Otis Elevator Company

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:10.740
in Hamilton, New Jersey.

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:12.292
They were so big
that they filled up

00:29:12.292 --> 00:29:13.750
the entirety of
the Holland Tunnel,

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:15.208
and they had to
close the thing off

00:29:15.208 --> 00:29:17.582
with a police escort from
4:00 to 5:00 in the morning

00:29:17.582 --> 00:29:18.540
as they were coming in.

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:27.100
The building was finally
finished in September of 1932.

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:28.390
Total cost of $16 million.

00:29:35.246 --> 00:29:38.960
In January of 1933, they had a
dedication for the elevators.

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:42.100
They invited 62 guests to
come drive up to the building,

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.219
drive into one of the elevators
up to the sixth floor,

00:29:45.219 --> 00:29:47.260
where they would have a
banquet dinner inside one

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:48.218
of the other elevators.

00:29:48.218 --> 00:29:50.355
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:50.355 --> 00:29:51.896
It was apparently
a really nice time.

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:58.560
On February of 1933, they
had the formal dedication

00:29:58.560 --> 00:29:59.940
for the building.

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:03.730
Dignitaries, speeches,
that kind of thing.

00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:06.500
Howard Coleman, an executive
of the Port Authority,

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:09.100
he placed a metal box in the
cornerstone of the building,

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:10.780
wherever that is.

00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:13.220
In that, he placed a copy
of the previous day's

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:18.450
"New York Times", copied the
contract with the railroads

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:21.320
for building this building,
and an image of when

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:24.607
FDR was on the site, first
breaking ground with a steam

00:30:24.607 --> 00:30:25.106
shovel.

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:34.897
The first user of the terminal
was on October 3rd of 1932.

00:30:34.897 --> 00:30:37.480
It was a truck with the American
Tobacco Company that came in,

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:41.200
8:00 AM for a shipment.

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.075
Everyone was excited.

00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:52.964
So how did it go?

00:30:52.964 --> 00:30:55.324
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:57.454 --> 00:30:59.870
The building actually has a
really storied and interesting

00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:01.497
history, in my opinion.

00:31:01.497 --> 00:31:04.080
They called the building above
the terminal the Port Authority

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.490
Commerce Building.

00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:09.830
And it had quite a variety
of tenants over the time.

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:13.480
These included Emerson
Radio for a while.

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:16.060
Macy's had some of their
toy storage division

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:17.971
on the third floor.

00:31:17.971 --> 00:31:22.180
Woolworth had the entire
third floor for a while.

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:24.820
The Triborough Bridge Authority
had their executive offices

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:25.320
there.

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.278
That's where Robert Moses,
if anyone knows him,

00:31:27.278 --> 00:31:28.190
sat for a while.

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:34.310
And various New Deal
agencies from the FDR era.

00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:36.209
Wrigley Chewing Gum
had about a quarter

00:31:36.209 --> 00:31:37.625
of the eleventh
floor for a while.

00:31:37.625 --> 00:31:38.940
It's interesting to
think about these things

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:41.050
as we walk through
these floors ourselves,

00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:43.910
chewing gum being
made over here.

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:46.940
But probably the coolest
tenant of them all, by far,

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:48.630
was Commerce Hall.

00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:51.731
It was the largest exhibition
center in New York.

00:31:51.731 --> 00:31:53.480
This was before the
Javits Center existed.

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:57.820
It took up the entire second
floor of the building.

00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:01.200
They had a lot of trade shows,
like the National Business

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:04.310
Show, the National Metals
Exhibition, things like that.

00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:07.200
But they also had some quirkier
stuff, the Leisure League

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:12.280
of America's Hobby Round-Up,
and the Empire Cat Club's

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:13.363
annual cat show.

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:22.970
The coinciding mouse and
rat show was canceled.

00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:24.980
The cat show
organizers apologized,

00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:27.010
but denied emphatically
that any of the cats

00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:28.040
consumed the exhibits.

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:30.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:33.060
But by far the coolest
exposition of all of them

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:35.540
was the Ford
exposition of progress.

00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:38.710
It opened up simultaneously with
the opening of Commerce Hall.

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:41.800
It was a massive World's
Fair-style celebration

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:45.680
of the auto industry,
run by Ford.

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:50.020
It included live steel
forging, happening on-premises,

00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:52.960
a miniature rubber plantation
that people could check out,

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:56.020
a working assembly line, and
a replica of the brick house

00:32:56.020 --> 00:33:00.130
where Ford built his
first car in 1893.

00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:02.980
Over 19 days, it had
2.3 million visitors,

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:06.880
and was considered, apparently,
the largest exhibition

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:10.548
show ever in New York.

00:33:10.548 --> 00:33:12.964
Ford himself, and his wife,
and his daughter all attended.

00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:20.310
It was also the site for the
city's first rooftop heli-port.

00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:25.320
The Port Authority was very
interested in helicopter

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:27.762
transit as a possible
way to move quickly

00:33:27.762 --> 00:33:28.595
throughout the city.

00:33:28.595 --> 00:33:30.510
You hear this theme about
efficiently moving things

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:30.960
throughout the city.

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:32.960
Helicopters were very
interesting in this regard

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:34.140
to the Port Authority.

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:36.619
It was built in 1950,
on Ninth Avenue rooftop.

00:33:36.619 --> 00:33:38.160
You can still see
the structure of it

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:40.464
today, although
there's no helicopters.

00:33:40.464 --> 00:33:42.880
They had about 10 takeoffs and
landings happening per day.

00:33:46.784 --> 00:33:50.380
It was also the site of the
city's first rooftop helicopter

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:51.020
crash.

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:52.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:57.470
In July of 1955, a
helicopter apparently

00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:59.970
was trying to take off, and was
stuck to a power cable which

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:02.220
they didn't unlatch.

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:06.270
It fell upside-down
onto the 16th floor,

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:07.970
dropped down to the
15th floor, and then

00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:10.030
stayed stuck there,
while a burning gas

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:11.300
tank fell onto Ninth Avenue.

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:16.610
Both the pilot and the
photographer on the helicopter

00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:17.110
were OK.

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:20.110
They both survived,
so it was OK.

00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:20.860
No, that was good.

00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:25.730
The building also
had its fair share

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:27.610
of interesting crime stories.

00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:31.250
It was the first hit,
in 1952, of "Mad Bomber"

00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:35.480
Georgia Metesky's terror rein
of New York City over 16 years,

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:37.560
in a phone booth in the lobby.

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:40.000
In 1944, it was the
scene of a payroll heist

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.190
with masked bandits,
submachine guns,

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:45.550
and pistol duels in the street.

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:48.300
But by far the most infamous
and devastating caper of them

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:53.610
all was the great
1936 poultry-napping

00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:57.241
of a $500 turkey hen from the
poultry industry's exposition.

00:34:57.241 --> 00:34:59.740
And I'm just going to read "The
New York Times" play-by-play

00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:01.040
on this, because it's worth it.

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:09.550
"On Wednesday morning,
the drunken man

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:13.030
showed up at the exposition,
red of face, bleary of eye,

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:15.480
and very much at home.

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:17.520
Shortly before the
Wednesday closing time,

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:20.320
the uninvited guest
reappeared, more bleary of eye

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:23.360
than he had been
in the forenoon.

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:26.480
None saw him enter,
and none saw him leave.

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.560
He was later seen
on Eighth Avenue.

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:31.610
Under his arm was a bulky,
paper-wrapped package,

00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:34.090
from the rear of which protruded
the legs of a particularly

00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:34.944
fine fowl."

00:35:34.944 --> 00:35:37.314
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:37.314 --> 00:35:41.140
"Still later, a guard found
the bird missing from the show.

00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:43.960
Detectives found their man
at Fourteenth and Eighth,

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:48.100
still looking at the world
through the medium of alcohol.

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:49.730
But he had an alibi.

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:53.557
He had a fowl, but it was a
goose that a company gave him.

00:35:53.557 --> 00:35:55.640
The detectives thought
they caught him in the act,

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:56.880
but when they checked
with the company,

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.084
his story checked out."

00:35:58.084 --> 00:36:00.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:00.250 --> 00:36:03.440
"But the mysterious
goose-lover offered a deal.

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:06.270
Perhaps the $500,
14-pounder could

00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:08.246
be produced at a
certain restaurant

00:36:08.246 --> 00:36:09.870
if the exposition
manager were to offer

00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:13.625
in exchange a dressed
turkey of something choice.

00:36:13.625 --> 00:36:15.250
Ultimately, the
detectives arrested him

00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:18.540
and solved the case, but they
learned a valuable lesson

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:20.470
for the next time.

00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:23.310
A turkey hen does not squawk
when it is unceremoniously

00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:26.010
bundled up and carted away.

00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:32.640
Only gobblers squawk."

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.640
So this is all well and
good, but what about this?

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:39.720
The terminal, the reason
they built this whole thing

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:46.810
in the first place,
the plan to save

00:36:46.810 --> 00:36:50.660
New York-- how did that go?

00:36:56.730 --> 00:36:58.740
This is a chart of the
capacity of the station.

00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:01.540
It was built with the
capacity to handle all traffic

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:04.530
in its zone, all the traffic
coming from Manhattan.

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:07.228
The gray area would represent
that amount of traffic.

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:13.390
This is how much the
railroads used it.

00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:16.499
There was a blackout
period in World War II,

00:37:16.499 --> 00:37:17.540
out of security concerns.

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:20.290
That's why there's a blank
period in the '40s there.

00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:24.560
But you can see, it
wasn't heavily used.

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:27.380
Now, freight in New York
didn't go down, particularly.

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:30.135
It's not like the
city wasn't operating.

00:37:30.135 --> 00:37:32.510
It was operating somewhere,
but it wasn't happening here.

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:38.320
There was a Railway
Express Agency.

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.790
This was a conglomerate
owned by the railroads.

00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:45.122
It was basically UPS before
UPS existed, UPS on railroads.

00:37:45.122 --> 00:37:46.580
If you wanted to
deliver a package,

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:48.470
you could do it via
Railway Express.

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:51.020
And they did use the
facilities as a sublease.

00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:53.170
And as you can see, they
used it a fair amount.

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:55.035
So they gave the
building more utilization

00:37:55.035 --> 00:37:56.410
than it otherwise
would have had,

00:37:56.410 --> 00:37:58.170
but even that was
going down by the end.

00:37:58.170 --> 00:37:59.878
There was only one
period it was anywhere

00:37:59.878 --> 00:38:02.640
near close to real
good usage, and that

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:05.120
wasn't the point of what
this was being built for,

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:07.530
what this was supposed to do.

00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:09.846
So what's going on here?

00:38:12.796 --> 00:38:14.670
Well, the fact of the
matter is the railroads

00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:16.980
were never interested
in this plan.

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:19.150
Maybe the Port Authority
should have taken pause

00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:23.380
when, even in 1927, they noted
one railroad was "convinced

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:25.420
that the estimates of
these inland stations

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:28.220
would not produce the benefits
claimed, either for the public

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:30.420
or for the railroads."

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:33.960
That's not a
glowing endorsement.

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.800
The fact of the matter
is the railroads,

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:38.780
they didn't compete on price,
efficiency of the port.

00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:40.750
They don't really care
about these things.

00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:42.562
The ICC, they set prices.

00:38:42.562 --> 00:38:43.770
It cost however much it cost.

00:38:43.770 --> 00:38:45.686
It didn't matter what
railroad was being used.

00:38:45.686 --> 00:38:47.930
What they valued where
their proprietary networks.

00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:50.330
They valued they had a
line going to one area

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:51.407
that no one else had.

00:38:51.407 --> 00:38:53.490
They had a special terminal
in an area of the city

00:38:53.490 --> 00:38:55.997
that no one else
had in that area.

00:38:55.997 --> 00:38:58.330
They provided a quality of
service that no one else had.

00:38:58.330 --> 00:39:00.270
It was exactly their
differences that they

00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:02.090
thought were their
competitive advantages,

00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:03.631
and that's exactly
what this plan was

00:39:03.631 --> 00:39:05.045
trying to do to break down.

00:39:05.045 --> 00:39:07.670
So this was a relationship that
was really never meant to last.

00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:09.336
They didn't want
unions, or unification,

00:39:09.336 --> 00:39:11.570
or anything like that.

00:39:11.570 --> 00:39:13.110
At the beginning,
the Port Authority

00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:14.568
tried to take a
cooperative stance,

00:39:14.568 --> 00:39:17.510
tried to work with the
railroads cooperatively

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:18.820
to make this stuff work.

00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:20.640
When that was
clearly not working,

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:23.460
they tried to force the
railroads to use this.

00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:25.560
The railroads responded
by issuing a tariff

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:27.710
on the terminal for
certain kinds of freight,

00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:30.180
basically boycotting it.

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:32.360
The Port Authority
responded by lobbying

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:35.216
a newly-appointed federal
commissioner under FDR

00:39:35.216 --> 00:39:37.090
to try to get the federal
government to force

00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:39.577
use of these union terminals.

00:39:39.577 --> 00:39:41.910
The railroads responded by
abolishing the commissioner's

00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:42.409
role.

00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:46.910
They fought like this
through the '30s and '40s,

00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:48.701
but clearly, this
relationship was souring.

00:39:48.701 --> 00:39:50.820
It was a real problem.

00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:53.540
However, there was an even
far more severe problem

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:57.780
that was happening, which made
all of this near meaningless,

00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:00.016
and that was this.

00:40:00.016 --> 00:40:05.200
This was the next
transportation revolution.

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:07.140
The age of the motor truck.

00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:09.644
Roads.

00:40:09.644 --> 00:40:11.685
It offered a level of
flexibility and convenience

00:40:11.685 --> 00:40:13.950
that the railroads just
could not begin to match.

00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:17.800
And this was the death knell
for the railroad industry.

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:19.810
At the time that the
building was being planned,

00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:23.150
everything moved by railroads.

00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:25.410
By the 1940s, about
2/3 of freight

00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:28.900
was now moving via
long-distance trucks.

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:32.072
These original 12 railroads
that were serving the city?

00:40:32.072 --> 00:40:35.816
In 1958, they were down to five.

00:40:35.816 --> 00:40:39.800
1960, four.

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:44.040
1970, two.

00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:46.420
The railroads were dying.

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:48.730
This was a huge problem.

00:40:48.730 --> 00:40:52.390
This building, the
Comprehensive Plan,

00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:54.720
the existence of the
Port Authority itself--

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:57.900
it was all built for an era
that was completely collapsing

00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:58.668
around them.

00:41:01.532 --> 00:41:02.990
This whole
Comprehensive Plan thing

00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:07.480
was now becoming increasingly,
alarmingly irrelevant.

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:08.750
That's not good.

00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:22.320
The Port Authority responded to
this by basically jumping ship.

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:24.770
They abandoned their
original purpose

00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:26.760
and dove into this new
world of the automobile,

00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:30.250
without ever really
looking back.

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:32.500
They saw that these trucks,
this whole truck industry,

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:35.530
had the same exact problems
as the railroad industry,

00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:37.575
of duplication, and
so on and so on.

00:41:37.575 --> 00:41:39.450
And they end up identifying
the same pattern,

00:41:39.450 --> 00:41:43.430
and they end up proposing the
same exact solution for trucks.

00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:46.110
So in the 1940s, they
proposed a new station,

00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:47.370
Inland Terminal Number Two.

00:41:47.370 --> 00:41:51.950
It would be 1,000 feet long by
175 feet, a union motor truck

00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:55.295
terminal, doing the same
exact thing as this one.

00:41:55.295 --> 00:41:56.836
It would be the
biggest in the world.

00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:03.630
It opened in November of 1949,
at the corner of Washington

00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:06.270
Street and Houston Street.

00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:10.190
And it had the
same exact results.

00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:12.132
No one used it.

00:42:12.132 --> 00:42:13.590
The trucking
companies, they didn't

00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:16.537
want to lose their
individual identity.

00:42:16.537 --> 00:42:18.870
So it limped along below
capacity for a number of years,

00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:21.720
until UPS signed on
as an anchor tenant.

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:25.186
And they eventually bought
the building in 1992.

00:42:25.186 --> 00:42:26.560
This is what it
looks like today.

00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:33.320
But you know, the Port Authority
is committed or stubborn,

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:35.720
depending on your
vantage point, and they

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:36.730
said, let's do it again.

00:42:36.730 --> 00:42:37.524
Let's try it again.

00:42:37.524 --> 00:42:39.081
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:41.905
So in 1945, they proposed
an even bigger terminal.

00:42:41.905 --> 00:42:43.496
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:46.940
Union Motor Truck
Terminal Number Three,

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:50.010
1,100 feet by 200 feet,
and definitely the largest

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:52.540
in the world.

00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:55.370
They made another
pretty rendering for it.

00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:57.690
And this one opened in 1951.

00:42:57.690 --> 00:42:59.510
This was an immediate disaster.

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:01.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:04.850
The local trucking
unions boycotted it.

00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:06.140
They didn't want to use it.

00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:08.810
And this one limped
badly for a while.

00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:13.230
And then this, too,
ultimately got sold in 1980.

00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:14.802
This is what it
looks like today.

00:43:19.410 --> 00:43:23.210
But how about this one,
Inland Terminal Number One,

00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:26.310
the original one, the one that
started all of this happening?

00:43:26.310 --> 00:43:28.660
What happened with them,
with it, with here?

00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:32.900
This is going to sound sad.

00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:35.620
It continued its slow
decline into sad irrelevance

00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:38.080
over the years.

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:40.394
In 1957, the first serious
downsizing happened.

00:43:40.394 --> 00:43:42.310
That's when the railroads,
for the first time,

00:43:42.310 --> 00:43:44.000
subleased a big
chunk of the terminal

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.870
and ceased to
exclusively use it.

00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:50.160
By 1963, the railroads
officially ended their leases

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:52.390
and stopped using it.

00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:54.680
Railway Express
continued on for a while,

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:56.890
but they also fell
onto hard times,

00:43:56.890 --> 00:44:00.272
and they fell
apart in the 1960s.

00:44:00.272 --> 00:44:01.730
The Port Authority,
meanwhile, they

00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:03.072
were interested in other things.

00:44:03.072 --> 00:44:04.530
They were paying
a lot of attention

00:44:04.530 --> 00:44:07.410
to managing the region's
airports, to creating

00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:08.960
new shipping
terminals, especially

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:13.630
in Elizabeth and Newark,
to the PATH stations,

00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:17.748
and to their newest pet
project, the World Trade Center.

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:27.420
The World Trade Center
opened up in April of 1973.

00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:29.530
Same time, the Port Authority
put this building up

00:44:29.530 --> 00:44:33.170
for sale at auction.

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:35.640
They ultimately sold it to
that real estate developer

00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:37.710
known as Sylvan
Lawrence, which used

00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:40.410
to be a very big developer
in New York, for $24 million.

00:44:42.797 --> 00:44:45.130
Port Authority themselves,
they moved their headquarters

00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:47.990
then from the 15th
floor of this building

00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:50.900
into the new World Trade Center.

00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:53.236
And the long and
the storied identity

00:44:53.236 --> 00:44:54.860
of this building as
more than something

00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:57.160
than just another New
York office building

00:44:57.160 --> 00:45:00.090
was officially over.

00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:05.464
Which begs the question, was
this union terminal theory

00:45:05.464 --> 00:45:06.130
just misfounded?

00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:14.410
I'm going to really
quickly summarize

00:45:14.410 --> 00:45:18.802
between 1973 and today.

00:45:18.802 --> 00:45:20.260
Sylvan Lawrence
bought the company,

00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:22.192
as I mentioned earlier.

00:45:22.192 --> 00:45:23.650
They added some
significant tenants

00:45:23.650 --> 00:45:26.960
like the St. Vincent's Cancer
Center, and BarnesandNoble.com

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:28.100
in the '90s.

00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:33.942
But in the '80s and
'90s, they themselves

00:45:33.942 --> 00:45:35.650
started to fall apart
as an organization.

00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:37.108
One of the partners
died, and there

00:45:37.108 --> 00:45:38.870
became this horrible
legal dispute

00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:41.100
between his widow and
the other partner,

00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:44.350
and basically, the
whole company dissolved.

00:45:44.350 --> 00:45:47.740
In 1998, I think it was,
they sold their last four

00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:48.740
properties in Manhattan.

00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:50.860
They used to have
128 properties.

00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:52.990
They sold their
last four properties

00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:56.380
to a partnership of
Blackacre Capital and Taconic

00:45:56.380 --> 00:46:03.021
Investments, for a
deal of $387.5 million

00:46:03.021 --> 00:46:04.145
across the four properties.

00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:08.360
Then Taconic bought
it out, and they

00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:10.560
continued to seriously
update the building.

00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:12.250
They created the
efforts of turning this

00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:16.570
into the carrier hotel that made
it basically a holder of some

00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:19.957
of the backbone infrastructure
of the internet.

00:46:19.957 --> 00:46:21.540
And they started to
attract a lot more

00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:25.670
upscale, quote-unquote,
"first class" tenants.

00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:28.770
They attracted one particularly
ambitious and hungry tenant

00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:32.560
called Google, if I'm
pronouncing that right--

00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:34.091
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:38.270
--who moved here in 2006
onto the fourth floor.

00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:40.850
Google eventually bought the
building outright in 2010,

00:46:40.850 --> 00:46:44.005
for $1.9 billion
dollars, which is easily

00:46:44.005 --> 00:46:46.130
one of the largest real
estate deals in US history.

00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:53.486
So what became of all the
main characters of this story?

00:46:57.140 --> 00:47:02.310
The trucking industry continued
to rise without challenge,

00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:04.870
and became what today is the
unambiguously dominant form

00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:07.460
of transport across the land.

00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:12.120
Today, about 65% of US
freight moves via truck.

00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:16.100
In New York, it's 90%.

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:19.438
We see this directly in the
congestion and pollution

00:47:19.438 --> 00:47:21.188
that we see on our
city streets every day.

00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:27.090
The railroads?

00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:29.310
By the time this building
was sold in 1973,

00:47:29.310 --> 00:47:32.010
the industry was already
solidly collapsing.

00:47:32.010 --> 00:47:35.526
The last old railroad empires,
they bankrupted in the 1970s,

00:47:35.526 --> 00:47:38.150
and they were ultimately folded
into a government agency called

00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:40.550
Conrail.

00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:41.760
But the concept never died.

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:42.940
Railroads still exist.

00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:44.420
They're still good
at what they do.

00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:48.385
And even today, about 11% of
US freight moves via rail,

00:47:48.385 --> 00:47:50.260
and it's still a $60
billion dollar industry.

00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:57.070
As for the Port
of New York, it's

00:47:57.070 --> 00:47:59.100
still a major port,
an important port,

00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:00.410
but it's no longer the biggest.

00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:04.340
It's now third behind Los
Angeles and Long Beach.

00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:06.440
Critically, all of the
port infrastructure

00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:08.870
migrated from Manhattan over
to Elizabeth and Newark.

00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:11.360
You can kind of see that if
you look at the container

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:14.570
ships and those facilities when
you're by Newark Airport today.

00:48:14.570 --> 00:48:17.650
And that's why we have parks on
the Manhattan waterfront today

00:48:17.650 --> 00:48:19.980
instead of shipping piers.

00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:23.900
Oh, and that tunnel that was
part of the Comprehensive Plan

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:27.000
that would connect Jersey
City to Bay Ridge in Brooklyn,

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.330
there's a lot of talk of trying
to rebuild that again today.

00:48:30.330 --> 00:48:32.696
So maybe there was
really something to that.

00:48:32.696 --> 00:48:37.377
That 90% of freight that comes
by truck, maybe that whole rail

00:48:37.377 --> 00:48:38.210
thing still matters.

00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:42.151
The Port Authority?

00:48:42.151 --> 00:48:44.650
They're as big and relevant and
involved with as many things

00:48:44.650 --> 00:48:48.592
as ever, as anyone who has
used any of the airports,

00:48:48.592 --> 00:48:51.050
used any of the tunnels-- the
Lincoln Tunnel or the Holland

00:48:51.050 --> 00:48:54.530
Tunnel-- the George Washington
Bridge, rides a PATH train,

00:48:54.530 --> 00:48:56.770
stairs up at the new
World Trade Center,

00:48:56.770 --> 00:49:00.994
or has heard of
"Bridge-gate," knows about.

00:49:00.994 --> 00:49:04.300
Oh, and that terminal concept,
that unified terminal concept,

00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:05.870
that one that they
tried three times

00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:08.527
and failed at three
times, that one which

00:49:08.527 --> 00:49:10.860
is part of the very founding
of why the organization was

00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:12.780
created, their plan
to save New York,

00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:15.475
all that-- well,
they tried it again.

00:49:15.475 --> 00:49:17.136
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:21.266
In the 1950s, they
found yet another case

00:49:21.266 --> 00:49:22.890
where there were
disparate carriers who

00:49:22.890 --> 00:49:25.200
had duplicated infrastructure
and weren't really

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:26.440
working efficiently together.

00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:32.230
So they built another
union terminal.

00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:35.900
And this one, this
time, it worked.

00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:37.890
This one was wildly
successful and is still

00:49:37.890 --> 00:49:40.280
heavily used today.

00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:42.136
And yes, it did originally
looked like that.

00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:49.250
Finally, of course, there's
this, 111 Eighth Avenue,

00:49:49.250 --> 00:49:50.710
the one that started it all.

00:49:53.996 --> 00:49:55.120
It may have failed in its--

00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:57.585
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:06.490
It may have failed in its stated
purpose, original purpose,

00:50:06.490 --> 00:50:08.820
but clearly something
clicked with this building

00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:09.470
at some point.

00:50:13.590 --> 00:50:16.560
Now a thriving home
to Google, where

00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:18.560
we're building the
transportation pipelines that

00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:22.210
define our own digital
era, some of this vision

00:50:22.210 --> 00:50:24.160
of scientific progress
and efficient networks

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:27.790
is finally thriving, albeit
under wildly different

00:50:27.790 --> 00:50:31.232
circumstances than its designers
ever might have imagined,

00:50:31.232 --> 00:50:36.380
and in a form unique to this
very different, but perhaps

00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:39.672
no less peculiar, age
in which we now live.

00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:43.560
Thank you.

00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:45.536
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:03.850 --> 00:51:05.270
If anyone wants
to ask questions,

00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:09.591
you're more than welcome to, and
there are microphones set up.

00:51:09.591 --> 00:51:10.090
Hey.

00:51:10.090 --> 00:51:10.589
Hey.

00:51:10.589 --> 00:51:13.840
What is one of the
original design

00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:16.400
elements of the building that
we, as Googlers, can still

00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:17.830
see today?

00:51:17.830 --> 00:51:19.430
What is your favorite one?

00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:20.700
That's a tough one.

00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:24.789
My personal favorite is
15th floor elevator lobby.

00:51:24.789 --> 00:51:27.080
That's where the executive
office of the Port Authority

00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:28.984
themselves were,
and you can still

00:51:28.984 --> 00:51:31.400
see it clearly looks different
than all the other elevator

00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:31.900
lobbies.

00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:33.520
It looks nicer.

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:37.734
And it even has insignias
of-- there's seagulls

00:51:37.734 --> 00:51:39.150
sculpted into the
walls, which are

00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:40.962
part of the insignia
of the Port Authority.

00:51:40.962 --> 00:51:42.670
It's something you
might not particularly

00:51:42.670 --> 00:51:44.169
notice if you're
not looking for it,

00:51:44.169 --> 00:51:47.320
but you can definitely
feel the history in that.

00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:50.160
So what's with those
weird bumps of concrete

00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:51.700
on the side of the
building outside?

00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:53.991
Well, you know, it was built
as a truck terminal, which

00:51:53.991 --> 00:51:57.030
meant the entirety of 15th
and 16th Streets from Eighth

00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:59.320
to Ninth Avenue were
intended for merchant trucks

00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:01.080
to come in and load
and unload freight.

00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:03.380
So that was to protect
the building from trucks

00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:04.830
banging into the structures.

00:52:04.830 --> 00:52:06.580
We still have a little
bit of that, right?

00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:07.630
There's still a few
loading bays for that.

00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:09.990
But most of that has
been replaced by walls

00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:11.623
and first floor tenants.

00:52:15.570 --> 00:52:16.660
Go ahead.

00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:18.324
Yes.

00:52:18.324 --> 00:52:20.240
Isn't there something
to do with this building

00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:24.690
and the Transatlantic
Cable or ISPs in general?

00:52:24.690 --> 00:52:27.412
That's a great question, and
there very well might be.

00:52:27.412 --> 00:52:29.120
My level of knowledge
about this building

00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:30.910
doesn't actually
go to that point.

00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:32.505
So when it came to
the modern history

00:52:32.505 --> 00:52:34.404
of this building
and its connection

00:52:34.404 --> 00:52:36.320
with the internet and
internet infrastructure,

00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:38.650
I honestly don't know any
better than you do about that.

00:52:38.650 --> 00:52:40.525
But I think there are
people in this room who

00:52:40.525 --> 00:52:43.090
probably could tell you that.

00:52:43.090 --> 00:52:45.680
So as part of one of
the advertisements,

00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:48.380
the building had
a penthouse level.

00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:50.189
Were there ever people
living on the 16th--

00:52:50.189 --> 00:52:50.980
This building here?

00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:51.480
Yes.

00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:52.553
I did not see that.

00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:55.952
I don't know.

00:52:55.952 --> 00:52:57.160
It's an interesting question.

00:52:57.160 --> 00:52:59.540
They were actually planning
14 stories for this building.

00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:01.873
I don't know when the 15th,
and then ultimately whatever

00:53:01.873 --> 00:53:03.460
we had with the 16th came up.

00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:06.790
But maybe it's
something to explore.

00:53:06.790 --> 00:53:07.475
Thank you.

00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:14.270
So one of the things that
I'm curious about here--

00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:16.640
you talked a lot about
all of this rail freight

00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:20.370
coming into New Jersey, and then
having to cross into Manhattan.

00:53:20.370 --> 00:53:21.470
Why was that?

00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:23.800
Was stuff being
manufactured in Manhattan

00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:25.027
that this was raw goods for?

00:53:25.027 --> 00:53:27.110
Was it stuff that was
supplying the New York area?

00:53:27.110 --> 00:53:30.418
Why not just put it onto
ships in New Jersey?

00:53:33.586 --> 00:53:35.210
Well, that's also
what happened, right?

00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:40.116
Today, the Port of New York,
including the waterfront part

00:53:40.116 --> 00:53:41.490
of it, does happen
in New Jersey.

00:53:41.490 --> 00:53:43.392
But it's basically the
history of-- New York

00:53:43.392 --> 00:53:45.850
became a big and important city
well before New Jersey did.

00:53:45.850 --> 00:53:48.980
So New Jersey still
is, but at the time,

00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:50.900
it was many smaller
municipalities which

00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:52.100
couldn't really cooperate
with each other,

00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:53.660
so they really couldn't
provide a good infrastructure

00:53:53.660 --> 00:53:54.309
for ports.

00:53:54.309 --> 00:53:55.850
So the big city,
which was originally

00:53:55.850 --> 00:53:57.630
Manhattan, and
eventually New York,

00:53:57.630 --> 00:53:58.890
they had their act
together, and that just

00:53:58.890 --> 00:54:00.230
became the natural focal point.

00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:02.670
And of course, the Erie
Canal, when that developed,

00:54:02.670 --> 00:54:04.822
things like New Jersey
didn't matter so much.

00:54:04.822 --> 00:54:06.030
So it's basically historical.

00:54:06.030 --> 00:54:07.905
But ultimately, what
you're saying absolutely

00:54:07.905 --> 00:54:12.665
does make a difference, and that
is how things ultimately went.

00:54:12.665 --> 00:54:13.781
Thank you.

00:54:13.781 --> 00:54:15.030
Thank you very much, everyone.

00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:17.480
[APPLAUSE]
