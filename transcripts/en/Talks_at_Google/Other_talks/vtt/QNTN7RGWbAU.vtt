CLIFF REDEKER: Welcome to
another Talks at Google event.

00:00:02.383 --> 00:00:03.040
I am Cliff.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.100
The man of the hour we have
here is Brian Kelly, the CEO

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.613
and Founder of thepointsguy.com.

00:00:07.613 --> 00:00:08.790
Welcome to Google.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:09.300
BRIAN KELLY: Thanks
for having me.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:09.653
CLIFF REDEKER: Thank you.

00:00:09.653 --> 00:00:10.814
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.814 --> 00:00:12.690
All right.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.954
So we have a lot of travel
fans in the audience.

00:00:15.954 --> 00:00:17.870
We're also streaming it
live to Google offices

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:19.820
worldwide and the folks
at home at YouTube.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.040
And so had a few questions
to go through right now,

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.670
and then we'll have time for
some open audience Q&amp;A as well.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.657
So if there's any burning
questions about your points

00:00:27.657 --> 00:00:30.240
or if you have a wallet full of
credit cards you need audited,

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.661
just let us know.

00:00:31.661 --> 00:00:32.619
We'll make that happen.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.540
BRIAN KELLY: I actually tried
to do a wallet audit at lunch

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.860
today.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.680
So if you want to show
me your assortment,

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.816
I can whip you into shape.

00:00:38.816 --> 00:00:40.440
CLIFF REDEKER: We
can make that happen.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.424
And, of course, Googlers are
really passionate about travel.

00:00:43.424 --> 00:00:45.340
We have that small thing
called Google Flights

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.750
search, the ITA Matrix,
the hotel bookings.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.919
So we're really
passionate about that.

00:00:49.919 --> 00:00:52.210
And that, in fact, leads me
to my first question, which

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.780
is really about technology.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.430
And so it seems that
a lot of this game,

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.170
a lot of the frequent
flyer mile program

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.810
is built on this almost
Cold War race of,

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.450
who has the most information,
and whose computer system

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.410
is 30 years old to load mistake
fares, and stuff like that?

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.860
Like, how do you view
the role of technology

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.610
in the travel industry,
and also in miles?

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.151
BRIAN KELLY: Well, I think in
general in the travel industry,

00:01:14.151 --> 00:01:15.535
we're still way behind.

00:01:15.535 --> 00:01:17.660
I think one of the top
questions I always get asked

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.035
is, I have these
amount of miles.

00:01:19.035 --> 00:01:19.800
Where can I go?

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.970
And there still really
is no perfect system

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.040
that will actually correspond
with airline award inventory.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.185
You know, the airlines are
very protective of that data

00:01:30.185 --> 00:01:33.150
with sites like AwardWallet
for tracking your miles.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.010
Some airlines even
cut off access.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.960
So we're actually pretty far
behind, I think, in general.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.960
But that's where
opportunity lies.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.010
As you mentioned, mistake fares.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.600
Deals spread like wildfire.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.012
And we have seen in 2016 more
crazy deals. $200 to Auckland.

00:01:49.012 --> 00:01:53.470
And you know, last year we
had the $185 to Abu Dhabi.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.677
So it's still a good time
to be in this sphere.

00:01:56.677 --> 00:01:57.510
CLIFF REDEKER: Yeah.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.280
Do you see a push on the
credit card companies,

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.880
the airlines to try
to catch up on it?

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.712
Or is it just--

00:02:03.712 --> 00:02:05.920
BRIAN KELLY: Yeah, I mean,
it's a cat-and-mouse game.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.420
You know, Chase
recently instituted,

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.990
if you've had five cards
within the last two years,

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.570
you can get some
of their products.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.857
And they're expanding
that, we've seen recently.

00:02:13.857 --> 00:02:15.440
You know, the game
definitely changes,

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.789
but it's by far from over.

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:19.580
You have to maybe work
a little bit harder.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.520
But for those who
put time and effort

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.320
into learning the
ways of how to search

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.820
for availability that others
can't see, there's opportunity.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.028
CLIFF REDEKER: Yeah, exactly.

00:02:28.028 --> 00:02:29.400
It's almost an arbitrage.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.440
And for a lot of folks just
starting out and keeping

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.690
track of their miles
and their points,

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.280
they don't really
necessarily want

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.820
to spend too much effort doing
it, don't want to go nuts.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.261
What can you tell them
about how to get started?

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:42.760
And what are they
missing out by not

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.860
putting their
frequent flyer number

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.150
in on those
twice-a-year bookings?

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.180
BRIAN KELLY: Yeah, I mean, it's
not even-- a lot of people say,

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.320
oh, I don't travel that much, so
I'm not going to get into this.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.611
But it's not even about travel.

00:02:50.611 --> 00:02:53.230
More miles will be minted
this year from non-travel.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.230
So credit cards and
partner activity

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.480
than from actually flying.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.292
And especially as airlines now
go into revenue-- next week

00:03:00.292 --> 00:03:01.750
whenever you fly
American Airlines,

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.610
you'll receive miles
based on how much you

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.166
paid, not how far you fly,
if you bank to American.

00:03:07.166 --> 00:03:09.040
You know, there are
still more ways than ever

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.050
to get miles and points.

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.470
It's really about getting
the right credit card.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.220
It's really frequent
spender programs now.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.428
So get the right credit card.

00:03:15.428 --> 00:03:17.320
The bonuses are as high as ever.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.320
So even though airlines are
raising the price of awards,

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.350
you know, sometimes
overnight, you

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.380
can get miles and
points all around you

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.590
for doing everyday things.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.810
CLIFF REDEKER: Yeah.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.390
And as these programs get more
homogenized, like you said,

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.530
it's almost like a punch card
per dollar and everything.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.490
Is that a sign of the end times?

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.240
Like, is there still
a unique opportunity?

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.698
BRIAN KELLY: There's definitely
still unique opportunities.

00:03:39.698 --> 00:03:42.152
I just got back from-- I went
for three nights to Sydney

00:03:42.152 --> 00:03:43.360
and New Zealand this weekend.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.460
I flew Alaska
Airlines 70,000 miles

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.651
and $42 Qantas first class.

00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:48.650
And I was sitting there.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.220
I'm like, $42 out of
pocket as I'm laying.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.340
And I'm just looking at
everyone going to coach.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.780
And I'm like, those people
probably paid 20 times as much

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.590
as I did, cash out of pocket.

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.070
So the game is still there now.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.560
So the airlines have moved
to revenue based on earning.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.080
Now if the airlines ever moved
to revenue-based redemptions

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.930
like Southwest and JetBlue.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.740
You know, American Airlines,
that will take the glory out

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:13.819
of the game, so to speak.

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:15.860
I'm sure there'll be other
ways to get around it.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.529
But right now, I
mean, these airlines

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:19.820
still have these wonky charts.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.190
Half the time, the airline,
because of bad technology

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.150
and because they're working
on outdated systems,

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.200
there's still so many
ways to maximize.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.540
The fact that you can
fly San Diego to Istanbul

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.860
is the same exact amount
of miles as, you know,

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.770
Boston to Dublin makes no sense.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.580
But I don't think
that those changes are

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:38.788
going to happen anytime soon.

00:04:38.788 --> 00:04:40.320
So even if you're
new to the game,

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.369
there's still plenty
to take advantage of,

00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:44.160
as you do yourself.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.570
CLIFF REDEKER: Well, thank you.

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:45.522
Thank you.

00:04:45.522 --> 00:04:46.480
I try every little bit.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.530
I'm not quite up
to TPG territory.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.580
But one mile at a
time, as you said.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:51.890
[LAUGH]

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.800
So I also was curious as well,
like, the other news this year

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.210
is the sizable decline in price
for fares for premium cabins.

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.240
And so it's gotten to
the point, you know,

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.310
there's amazing things
on British Airways

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.280
and flights to Europe.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.940
As you were saying,
flights to New Zealand.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.800
Are we landing on sort
of an equilibrium price?

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.030
Like, the price is
right on these fares.

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.110
Like, is that a bad
thing when more people

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.250
are paying versus redemption?

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.684
Or how do you see that balance?

00:05:18.684 --> 00:05:19.350
BRIAN KELLY: No.

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.080
I mean-- well, I think
the first thing is

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.509
free upgrades are disappearing.

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:23.800
And that's indisputable, right?

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.670
So if you're just
getting into the game now

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.600
and you want to race
to get elite status,

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.730
and you're going to expect to
get free upgrades all the time,

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.480
likely set your expectations--
now with elite status,

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.850
especially at the very highest
tiers, is still very valuable.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.440
So I think it's
actually a good place.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.080
In the past, airlines priced
first class and business class

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.230
so ridiculously
and out of touch.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.550
10 times the price of economy
for, like, a little bit

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.024
of a recliner and crappy food.

00:05:48.024 --> 00:05:49.440
So now the airlines
are actually--

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.880
I think pricing is becoming
more sane and affordable.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.632
And that's great for consumers.

00:05:55.632 --> 00:05:57.340
But that's also why
I think people should

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.480
diversify miles and points.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.590
It's not just about airfare.

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.298
So many people are
myopically focused on,

00:06:01.298 --> 00:06:03.900
let me just get airline miles
for the free-- but hotels

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.217
and other experiences,
you should really

00:06:07.217 --> 00:06:08.550
diversify your miles and points.

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:09.980
And that's, I think,
one key thing I

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:10.920
would like everyone to get away.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.090
If you're just getting
into this, don't just,

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.190
oh, I fly United Airlines.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.481
I'm going to get United credit
card and United, United,

00:06:16.481 --> 00:06:17.370
United.

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:18.340
Try to diversify.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.484
Get transferable
points programs so

00:06:21.484 --> 00:06:22.900
that when it comes
time to redeem,

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:23.770
you've got lots of options.

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:24.590
CLIFF REDEKER: Yeah, that's
what I was going to say.

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.256
Like, with the big four
transferable points,

00:06:27.256 --> 00:06:29.380
it seems that the airlines
still have a lot of ways

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.463
to go to catch up to that.

00:06:30.463 --> 00:06:31.800
Do you see that continuing?

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.030
Just keep banking to the
cities, the Chase, the Amex?

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:35.780
BRIAN KELLY: Yeah.

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.810
I mean, so the relationships,
just so people don't-- these

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.640
are huge profit
centers for airlines.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.660
Frequent flyer programs are
arguably the most effective

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.190
marketing technique
ever created.

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:48.300
So American Airlines just signed
on with Citi and Barclaycard

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.880
to issue their cards.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.285
So that means more products.

00:06:51.285 --> 00:06:52.660
You know, so Citi
and Barclaycard

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.994
will be competing against each
other for American Airlines

00:06:55.994 --> 00:06:57.660
credit card business,
which is something

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:58.510
we've never seen before.

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.330
Everyone thought they'd
just go with one partner.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.810
So there's tons and tons of
competition on the marketplace.

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:06.080
You know, American Express
lost JetBlue to Barclaycard.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.420
They lost Costco to Citi.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.990
So this actually bodes
well for consumers.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:11.680
So once again, I
think my key point is,

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.460
even though these
are travel programs,

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.084
really, it's all
about the credit card.

00:07:15.084 --> 00:07:17.450
So getting the
right credit cards,

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:19.580
getting it on huge bonuses,
and then beyond that,

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.251
maximizing every single dollar
you spend is the way to win.

00:07:23.251 --> 00:07:25.500
CLIFF REDEKER: There's even
an app for that on the TPG

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.880
that will help you.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.160
BRIAN KELLY: There is, TPG
To Go on the app store.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.010
CLIFF REDEKER: Yes.

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:31.267
Android and iOS.

00:07:31.267 --> 00:07:32.350
BRIAN KELLY: Thanks a lot.

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:33.183
CLIFF REDEKER: Yeah.

00:07:33.183 --> 00:07:34.280
I do what I can.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.070
So then also, moving
the conversation again

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:38.380
towards the infrequent flyers.

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.630
Like, are there
three basic things

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.755
that you'd recommend people
do just starting out?

00:07:42.755 --> 00:07:44.640
And of course, there's
articles on TV,

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.120
thepointsguy.com to that end.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:49.304
But anything that people
miss from the get-go?

00:07:49.304 --> 00:07:49.970
BRIAN KELLY: No.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.344
I mean, I think just sign up
for frequent flyer programs.

00:07:52.344 --> 00:07:54.440
But instead, if you're
flying American Airlines,

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.730
you don't have to bank
your frequent flyer

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:56.830
miles to American Airlines.

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:58.820
So if you buy a really
cheap ticket on American,

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.486
you may want to actually bank to
British Airways, their partner,

00:08:01.486 --> 00:08:03.980
which actually can
provide amazing value.

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.054
And once you're redeeming
miles, don't assume,

00:08:06.054 --> 00:08:07.470
if I've got British
Airways miles,

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:08.700
I'm going to redeem
on British Airways.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.174
That's often the
worst redemption.

00:08:10.174 --> 00:08:11.840
So you have to think
counterintuitively.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:12.790
It makes no sense.

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:14.748
You think, well, why
would British Airways make

00:08:14.748 --> 00:08:16.057
better redemptions on partners?

00:08:16.057 --> 00:08:18.390
Just stop asking yourself
those questions, because logic

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:20.360
never works with
airlines and hotels.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.610
You just take advantage of it.

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:24.790
So think outside the box.

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:26.707
You know, like, we have
over 9,000 blog posts.

00:08:26.707 --> 00:08:29.290
We're actually going through a
major web redesign as we speak.

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:31.236
And hopefully this
fall, we're relaunching,

00:08:31.236 --> 00:08:32.610
and it's going to
be much easier.

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:33.526
Right now, it's funny.

00:08:33.526 --> 00:08:35.485
People I'm like, just go
Google the points guy,

00:08:35.485 --> 00:08:37.276
and then put your topic
in, and then you'll

00:08:37.276 --> 00:08:38.220
see all the results.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:41.470
So thank you to the search team
for making it so easy to search

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:44.020
our hot mess of a website.

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:45.600
I think that was two things.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.490
The third is just think
counterintuitively.

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:48.080
You all are very--

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:48.630
[MICROPHONE SQUEAK]

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:49.270
--smart.

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:49.770
CLIFF REDEKER: Yeah.

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:50.478
BRIAN KELLY: God?

00:08:50.478 --> 00:08:51.176
[LAUGH]

00:08:51.749 --> 00:08:52.790
Think counterintuitively.

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:54.532
This is a fun game
that can be won.

00:08:54.532 --> 00:08:55.990
Yes, it takes a
little bit of time.

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:57.490
But when you think
about this hobby,

00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:00.870
I think it's amazing that
this hobby can actually help

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:02.367
you travel more and spend less.

00:09:02.367 --> 00:09:04.950
And I always sit down, and it's
like doing a crossword puzzle.

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:07.302
Like, how can I
get to Abu Dhabi?

00:09:07.302 --> 00:09:09.510
And it's amazing, once you
build up miles and points,

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:10.620
the freedom that it gives you.

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.250
The fact that right now
I've got so many miles

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:14.010
that I can go to
SFO and be anywhere

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:17.049
in the world in, like,
16 hours, first class.

00:09:17.049 --> 00:09:18.090
And that's another thing.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:20.430
Last minute's the best
time to use miles.

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:22.100
Airlines and their
pricing models,

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:25.040
they'll open up tons and tons
of space, even to Sydney.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.180
So if you're flexible
and spontaneous,

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:30.106
you can get insane amounts
of value for miles.

00:09:30.106 --> 00:09:31.980
Even if you don't want
to go to the Maldives,

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.990
if you ever have a
family emergency,

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.776
miles are like an
insurance policy.

00:09:35.776 --> 00:09:37.150
You're on vacation
in Europe, you

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:40.000
need to come home last
minute, airlines don't care.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.890
Even the bereavement fares
are full fare minus, like, $5,

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:44.390
right?

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:47.150
So protect yourself with
frequent flyer miles and credit

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:48.917
card points.

00:09:48.917 --> 00:09:49.750
CLIFF REDEKER: Yeah.

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:52.020
And of course, the blog has
a very international reach

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:52.520
as well.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:53.400
So how do you--

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.250
BRIAN KELLY: Well, the
international reach

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:56.690
on the Google Map wasn't
as much as we'd like it.

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:58.935
So we will be expanding.

00:09:58.935 --> 00:09:59.810
We're just in the UK.

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:02.310
That's our number two market,
and Canada's number three.

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:04.770
You know, points are universal.

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:05.980
And so yes.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:09.382
So those of you watching
abroad, the US programs

00:10:09.382 --> 00:10:11.840
are generally more generous
than the foreign frequent flyer

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:12.940
programs.

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:15.570
They have high fuel surcharges.

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:17.820
And I know people always
say, it's no fair in America.

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:19.900
The credit cards
are so generous.

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.311
And so figure out a way to
get a social security number.

00:10:22.311 --> 00:10:22.810
No.

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:23.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.644
Kidding.

00:10:24.644 --> 00:10:26.060
CLIFF REDEKER: Or
Brexit, I guess.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:26.830
BRIAN KELLY: Yeah.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:27.720
CLIFF REDEKER: Yeah.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:28.660
Cool.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:29.160
Cool.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:33.520
And then at Google, we do a fair
share of business travel here.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.730
Of course, we do have our
video conferences soon,

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:38.180
but nothing truly beats
the in-person meetings.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:41.140
And so we're also a
very frugal company.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:42.146
We want to be frugal--

00:10:42.146 --> 00:10:43.270
BRIAN KELLY: Google frugal?

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:43.870
CLIFF REDEKER: Yeah.

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:44.510
BRIAN KELLY: Frugal at Google?

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:45.885
CLIFF REDEKER: We
sunsetted that,

00:10:45.885 --> 00:10:47.540
but the spirit remains the same.

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:49.490
You know, frugal, but generous.

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:51.435
And so you know,
what sort of advice

00:10:51.435 --> 00:10:53.060
do you have for
business travelers that

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.200
want to maintain a sense
of price consciousness,

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.440
but at the same time,
want to build status?

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.310
Like, incorporate something that
benefits their personal travel

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:02.852
and their business travel?

00:11:02.852 --> 00:11:04.060
What's the business strategy?

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:06.910
BRIAN KELLY: I think
maintaining cost

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:09.000
is important for every
cost center, right?

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.880
As a business owner
myself, I make

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.875
my employees fly in middle
seats in the back of the plane.

00:11:14.875 --> 00:11:16.173
Just kidding.

00:11:16.173 --> 00:11:17.350
I'm actually very nice.

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:18.940
I actually used to take
their points from them,

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:19.981
but they don't like that.

00:11:19.981 --> 00:11:20.559
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:20.559 --> 00:11:21.350
That's really mean.

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:21.851
No.

00:11:21.851 --> 00:11:23.266
I let them--
actually, it's funny.

00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:25.380
When we go out to lunch,
people will overhear us.

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:26.510
I'm like, OK, you win.

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:27.870
You get to pay for lunch today.

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:30.370
Like, the waitresses are always
like, that's so mean of you.

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:31.560
And I'm like, no,
you don't get it.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.190
Like, they're getting points
and I'm paying them anyway.

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:34.023
CLIFF REDEKER: Yeah.

00:11:34.023 --> 00:11:35.129
5x.

00:11:35.129 --> 00:11:36.920
BRIAN KELLY: So loyalty
can save you money.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.294
So sticking with a hotel chain
that might be a little bit

00:11:39.294 --> 00:11:40.930
extra, but if
you're going to get

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:45.424
the free Wi-Fi and the perks
and be comfortable and rested,

00:11:45.424 --> 00:11:47.590
you know, it may make sense
to pay a little bit more

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:50.300
for a flight to build status,
to get the free checked bag.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:53.650
So I would just encourage
cost center managers

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:54.910
to see the bigger picture.

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:57.451
Because I think the big problem
in America is a lot of times,

00:11:57.451 --> 00:12:00.850
we go with the very cheapest
flight, and cheap is expensive.

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:03.880
So try to think a
little bit higher level.

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.030
But you know, loyalty,
especially at the top tiers,

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:07.140
can really pay off.

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:08.244
And let's be honest.

00:12:08.244 --> 00:12:09.410
Business travel is grueling.

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:10.720
It's time away from home.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:11.440
It's exhausting.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.569
It's bad for your health.

00:12:14.569 --> 00:12:17.110
So being able to be comfortable
and stick with a hotel chain,

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:18.370
even if it costs
a little bit more,

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:20.440
I think benefits the
business in the long run.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:20.670
CLIFF REDEKER: Yeah.

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:21.760
And then you hit
the ground running.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:22.468
You're not tired.

00:12:22.468 --> 00:12:24.580
You can go straight to
the meeting, or whatever.

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.000
And there are other businesses.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.910
Google has a very generous
policy in terms of money

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:31.350
that you save on one
trip can be banked

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:33.210
at a certain rate
towards another trip.

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:36.950
There's companies like Upside
and Rocketrip and TravelPerk.

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:38.230
What do you make of those?

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:40.670
Like, how does that
change the optimization?

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:41.450
BRIAN KELLY: Yeah.

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:42.440
And Upside's really interesting.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.356
We just met with them.

00:12:43.356 --> 00:12:44.780
So they basically
give gift cards

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.777
to business travelers
for being flexible,

00:12:46.777 --> 00:12:47.860
which I think makes sense.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.050
I mean, to be honest,
when I was on Wall Street,

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:51.466
there were times
when I would book

00:12:51.466 --> 00:12:53.980
last minute to get the full
fare to automatic upgrade.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:59.755
So when business
travelers are incentivized

00:12:59.755 --> 00:13:01.590
to travel better if
you book last minute,

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:04.440
I mean, I think it makes
sense if the company can

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.760
en masse save money by
leaving a day early or so.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.880
But I mean,
Rocketmiles, all those.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:13.670
They're nice little
boosts of bonuses

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:14.740
whenever you book hotels.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:17.720
But you know, Upside
is interesting.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:21.160
I won't really comment on it
until I can fully test it,

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.490
but the concept is interesting.

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:22.640
CLIFF REDEKER: Yeah.

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.098
Well, and there's
also the services

00:13:24.098 --> 00:13:26.820
that you book space on a
private plane and just jet

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:28.150
up and down to Los Angeles.

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:29.570
BRIAN KELLY: Yeah,
surveyors of the world.

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:30.070
Yeah.

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:30.904
They're interesting.

00:13:30.904 --> 00:13:31.736
CLIFF REDEKER: Yeah.

00:13:31.736 --> 00:13:33.528
I think you flew them
once to Miami, right?

00:13:33.528 --> 00:13:35.486
BRIAN KELLY: I did-- oh,
Blade in New York now.

00:13:35.486 --> 00:13:36.450
So Blade is a big one.

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:39.240
They fly helicopters
in the Northeast,

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:42.540
and they do a G5,
New York to Miami.

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:45.560
Which, I mean, that's bringing
the golden age of travel back.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.110
It's an amazing experience.

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:49.680
It's like $2,000 one way.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.590
I mean, you can use
points if you've got,

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:54.836
like, Capital One or
a rival plus miles.

00:13:54.836 --> 00:13:57.460
CLIFF REDEKER: Yeah, and for me,
the packing's always too much.

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:59.750
Like, I can't fit my
carry-on on the helicopter.

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:00.510
BRIAN KELLY: Yeah.

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:02.220
CLIFF REDEKER: Maybe
one step at a time.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:02.810
BRIAN KELLY: Life's hard, Cliff.

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:04.018
CLIFF REDEKER: I know, right?

00:14:04.018 --> 00:14:05.000
Right?

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.950
And this year, we've
seen a tough year

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:11.220
for certain high-value programs.

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:14.600
The American devaluations in
March, the switch in August

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.710
you talked about.

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:17.640
We of course have
always breaking news

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.670
on Citi and their
prestige, and you

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:22.510
know, rumors from Chase
about everything else.

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:25.880
Do you think that this is
the decline of the year

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:26.910
of the sign-up bonuses?

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:27.770
What are you afraid of?

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:28.470
What gives you hope?

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:30.420
BRIAN KELLY: Sign-up
bonuses, absolutely not.

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:31.340
So they come and go.

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:33.880
This year we've seen--
American Express is actually

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:35.540
sending out targeted offers.

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:38.604
250,000 Amex points for
the business platinum.

00:14:38.604 --> 00:14:39.520
So that's another tip.

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.070
Always, as much as
I'd like you all

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:44.150
to get credit card
through thepointguy.com--

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:47.350
that's our business model--
But check your mail.

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:50.930
Snail mail is still one of
the best ways to get offers.

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:52.390
So the bonuses are really high.

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:54.056
Of course, they're
tweaking the value

00:14:54.056 --> 00:14:56.430
of those points on the back
end, and they're coming down.

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:58.870
But beyond sign-up bonuses
and then just these

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:00.385
super lucrative earning ratios.

00:15:00.385 --> 00:15:02.170
And what the airlines
will give you--

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:05.470
the credit card companies will
give you on all the top spend,

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:09.440
really focus on maximizing
every single dollar.

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:12.750
I mean, 2 or 3x points
here and there may not

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:14.517
seem like much, but on a whole--

00:15:14.517 --> 00:15:15.975
CLIFF REDEKER:
Builds up over time.

00:15:15.975 --> 00:15:16.725
BRIAN KELLY: Yeah.

00:15:16.725 --> 00:15:19.650
So there are always
going to be devaluations.

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:21.680
But, you know, if a
card devalues so much,

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.150
a lot of people are
thinking about canceling

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:25.200
the Prestige next year
when those go into affect.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.820
You vote with your wallet.

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:29.660
Loyalty goes both
ways, you know?

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:32.087
So if you're unhappy with
the change, change airlines,

00:15:32.087 --> 00:15:33.670
start banking with
different programs.

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:33.830
CLIFF REDEKER: Yeah.

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:35.850
I think that's one thing that
people don't really fully

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:36.380
appreciate.

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:39.270
You want to go where the
benefits are the best,

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:41.080
and vote with the wallet.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:45.250
We had a question from
Darren, a Googler here.

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:47.490
He was wondering if you
have any recommendations

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:49.510
for nontraditional
ways of earning points

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:52.120
and miles beyond
credit card churning,

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.304
beyond manufactured spend.

00:15:53.304 --> 00:15:54.970
We don't see a lot
of manufactured spend

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:56.394
in The Points Guy.

00:15:56.394 --> 00:15:58.310
BRIAN KELLY: Well, the
manufactured spend-- so

00:15:58.310 --> 00:15:59.970
for people who
don't know it, it's

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:02.074
a little bit of a gray area.

00:16:02.074 --> 00:16:03.490
There's a lot of
different formats

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:06.030
where you can buy things
with a credit card.

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:08.420
So the main one
was in the 2000s,

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:11.210
you could buy US gold
coins from the treasury

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:12.950
at cost and free shipping.

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:14.575
So you'd buy,
let's say, $100,000

00:16:14.575 --> 00:16:17.009
worth of these coins delivered
in trucks to your house.

00:16:17.009 --> 00:16:19.300
You get 100,000 points, and
you go straight to the bank

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:20.430
and redeposit them.

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:22.000
So you just got
100,000 free points

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.750
for having the hassle
to redeem the coins.

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:25.590
So manufactured
spend, a lot of people

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:28.770
now will buy gift cards
with a credit card

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:31.320
at an office supply store
that gives 5x points,

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.830
and then even sell them on eBay.

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:37.042
Or you can then actually
move them into other formats.

00:16:37.042 --> 00:16:39.250
We have almost three million
monthly unique visitors.

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:41.350
We used to talk about Bluebird
and stuff from back in the day.

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:43.380
The problem with the internet,
as I'm sure many of you

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:44.879
are aware, people
don't read, right?

00:16:44.879 --> 00:16:46.470
So we would say, OK.

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:47.500
Get this Bluebird card.

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:48.930
This is the picture.

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:49.620
This is the one.

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:51.520
Don't get the Bluebird visa.

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:54.840
And we would get tons
of, I got the Bluebird.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:57.400
Wait, you got the--
so it's complex.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.370
And frankly, because
all the credit

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:00.920
card companies do
monitor our site.

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.910
So for the really
nitty gritty gray area,

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:04.750
it's not in anyone's
best interest.

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:07.361
So people, you know, there's
Reddit churning forums

00:17:07.361 --> 00:17:08.319
that are good for that.

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:11.560
FlyerTalk has
manufactured spend.

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:14.159
So those are the best areas to
really go and learn about that.

00:17:14.159 --> 00:17:16.450
CLIFF REDEKER: And it really
becomes a question of it's

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:16.900
all worth it.

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:19.359
I mean, you know, when you get
the miles, like, the effort--

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:19.839
BRIAN KELLY: Yeah.

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:21.672
You have to put a value
on your time, right?

00:17:21.672 --> 00:17:24.794
So you know, if your
time is valuable,

00:17:24.794 --> 00:17:28.660
it can be-- there
is risk involved.

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:30.330
I know a lot of
people buy gift cards.

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:31.610
And then PayPal,
for example, there

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:33.193
was a big PayPal
thing where you could

00:17:33.193 --> 00:17:36.400
get trans-- but all of this
borders on money laundering.

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.180
So a lot of this activity can
look like what drug dealers do,

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:41.236
and go to Walmart and
buy a money order,

00:17:41.236 --> 00:17:42.360
and then try to launder it.

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.520
So even though you really
aren't breaking the law,

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.200
accounts can get frozen.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:52.020
There's a lot of downside to
it that I frankly-- for me

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:57.180
and for business owners
out there-- so for all

00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:59.660
of our Google spend and
Facebook advertising,

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:02.860
Amex Business Gold has 3x on--
you can choose one category.

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:04.610
So internet advertising
and Google counts.

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:07.460
So we run all of our social
spend on credit cards,

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:08.850
and the first
100,000 we get, I'm

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:10.210
getting 300,000 Amex points.

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:12.849
So to pay $175 or
$195 for that card,

00:18:12.849 --> 00:18:14.890
I'm getting 200,000 extra
points than if I put it

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:15.556
on another card.

00:18:15.556 --> 00:18:18.300
So I really focus-- and
you can win at this game

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.100
by just staying
above board and just

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:21.810
playing by the rules they set.

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:22.860
It's pretty lucrative.

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:23.000
CLIFF REDEKER: Yeah.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.330
Keeping it legal is
something that's--

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:25.200
BRIAN KELLY: Keeping it legal.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:25.700
Exactly.

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:27.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:29.350
Using credit cards
for jail bonds.

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:30.683
That's a good blog post.

00:18:30.683 --> 00:18:31.516
CLIFF REDEKER: Yeah.

00:18:31.516 --> 00:18:34.600
And then redeeming the points
for champagne in the Delta Sky

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:35.200
Clubs

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:35.700
BRIAN KELLY: Yeah.

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:36.616
Little sparkling wine.

00:18:36.616 --> 00:18:38.050
I don't think they
have champagne.

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:39.049
CLIFF REDEKER: Prosecco.

00:18:39.049 --> 00:18:40.992
BRIAN KELLY: Not to mince words.

00:18:40.992 --> 00:18:43.450
CLIFF REDEKER: And then we had
another question from Janine

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:44.060
as well.

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:47.116
She was wondering, are you
an American million miler?

00:18:47.116 --> 00:18:48.490
Are such things
worth it anymore?

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:50.448
BRIAN KELLY: I'm not a
million miler, actually.

00:18:50.448 --> 00:18:52.130
So I think I'm, like, 700,000.

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:55.595
So I actually wasn't-- so
American used to be able to get

00:18:55.595 --> 00:18:57.970
million miler status by you
spending on your credit card.

00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:59.386
It was the one
airline that would.

00:18:59.386 --> 00:19:03.850
So back in the day, I
wasn't big into churning,

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:06.701
so I didn't get the
two million just

00:19:06.701 --> 00:19:07.950
by spending on my credit card.

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:09.920
So I'm doing it the
old-fashioned way, which I'll

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.086
get there in a couple years.

00:19:11.086 --> 00:19:14.340
But I mean, the million
mile status sounds amazing,

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:16.290
but it's really the
lowest level elite status.

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:17.790
Which these days, the
airlines have watered down

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:20.280
so much that you basically get
the same from a Coburn credit

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:20.780
card.

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:24.420
So as much as it's a
nice pat on the back--

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:26.116
and that's another
lesson I urge people,

00:19:26.116 --> 00:19:28.240
is I call it the elite
status hamster wheel, right?

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.270
Like so many people--
elite status.

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.860
I'm cool.

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:30.760
I'm part of the club.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.500
Well, you know, the
lower level elite

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.800
statuses these days
have been watered down

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:35.930
and benefits ripped apart.

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:38.090
You can't even select
a premium economy seat

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:39.954
on United and Delta now.

00:19:39.954 --> 00:19:41.120
They're really pulling back.

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:44.370
So you know, yes, it's nice to
have some airline elite status.

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:46.480
But especially in a
town like San Francisco,

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:50.270
United silver status
is worth as much as--

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:52.020
CLIFF REDEKER: Yeah,
this bottle of water.

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:52.520
Yeah.

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.980
Well, and even,
there's so many 1Ks

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:57.010
flying, like, SFO to O'Hare.

00:19:57.010 --> 00:20:00.450
I mean, executive platinum
status doesn't always clear.

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:03.869
And to that end as
well, I'm proud to say,

00:20:03.869 --> 00:20:06.160
I made executive platinum
for the first time this year.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:06.300
BRIAN KELLY: Woohoo!

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:06.770
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:07.870
CLIFF REDEKER: A little
mini accomplishment.

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:08.750
BRIAN KELLY: Halfway
through the year, too.

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:09.490
That's pretty impressive.

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:09.810
CLIFF REDEKER: Yeah.

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:11.810
Well, it's a lot of
that business class.

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:14.840
And went to Penang,
Malaysia for the fun

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:18.820
back through Cathay
First to Vancouver.

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:19.960
It's great this year.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.827
Next year, it's still
kind of questionable.

00:20:21.827 --> 00:20:22.660
Still up in the air.

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:24.493
We're not sure about
the spend requirements.

00:20:24.493 --> 00:20:27.540
BRIAN KELLY: Well, I
think the last two years,

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:30.906
we've seen a lot of change with
the US Airways merger settling.

00:20:30.906 --> 00:20:32.530
All the major mergers
have settled now.

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:35.024
You know, we're still
waiting on Alaska and Virgin.

00:20:35.024 --> 00:20:36.440
But in general, I
think we've gone

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.023
through a really big
period of change.

00:20:38.023 --> 00:20:39.632
And I think I
hopefully-- maybe I'm

00:20:39.632 --> 00:20:40.840
just too much of an optimist.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.214
I see over the
next couple years,

00:20:42.214 --> 00:20:45.899
there's not to be too much
drastic change going on.

00:20:45.899 --> 00:20:48.440
We're still waiting to see with
the Marriott-Starwood merger.

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.210
There's huge question
marks there with how

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:51.370
that's going to go down.

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:53.670
And that could affect
future hotel mergers.

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:56.390
But I think in
general, I mean, I'm

00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:58.880
looking forward
to some stability.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:01.810
I don't think there's going
to be major devaluations.

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:04.480
Unless you're Delta, which
devalues on a weekly basis.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.340
CLIFF REDEKER: It's
all a mystery there.

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:06.673
BRIAN KELLY: It's all a mystery.

00:21:06.673 --> 00:21:07.680
There's no award charts.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.221
CLIFF REDEKER: And
so for those of us

00:21:09.221 --> 00:21:11.270
that just joined, what
are the best fringe

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:13.340
benefits to take advantage
of besides the cafe

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:16.150
lounges, the cabanas, the
salt-and-pepper squid?

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:19.090
Anything that people might
not normally think of?

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:22.653
BRIAN KELLY: I mean, one
of the new lounges, Amex

00:21:22.653 --> 00:21:24.934
has Centurion lounges,
which they just

00:21:24.934 --> 00:21:26.100
opened in Houston this week.

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:27.280
San Francisco's really nice.

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.696
So these are
actually lounges that

00:21:28.696 --> 00:21:30.440
are-- I think a lot
of airline lounges

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:32.340
have dropped in quality.

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:35.050
So the Amex platinum's $450.

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:38.840
Off the bat, you get a
$200 airline fee credit.

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:40.897
And it says you can only
use it for airline fees,

00:21:40.897 --> 00:21:43.230
but in reality, you can
actually get airline gift cards.

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:45.679
So every year, I get
four $50 AA gift cards.

00:21:45.679 --> 00:21:47.720
So my $450 a year platinum
card all of the sudden

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:50.680
costs me $250 for Delta lounge
access and unlimited lounge

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:53.175
access to these Centurion
lounges, which at SFO is

00:21:53.175 --> 00:21:55.140
wine tasting, two free guests.

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:55.890
Everything's free.

00:21:55.890 --> 00:22:00.190
There's no up charges like
cheap other American carriers

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:02.710
that charge for premium cheese.

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:07.280
So I think-- and
points are great,

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:08.890
but perks can be even better.

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:10.960
So there are credit
cards out there.

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:11.820
The Citi Prestige.

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:13.110
Yes, there's terrible
news this week.

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:14.360
They're changing next year you.

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:15.610
Can't get into the AA lounges.

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:18.170
But the best benefits
still-- it's mildly tweaked,

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:21.530
but you get the fourth night
free of any hotel, basically,

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:22.950
including corporate rates.

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:26.140
See, that benefit
alone is unbelievable.

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:28.634
You can get many
thousands a year

00:22:28.634 --> 00:22:29.800
for paying for that benefit.

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:33.040
Plus you also get a
$250 airline credit.

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:36.260
So cheap is expensive is
another thing with credit cards,

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:39.021
that annual fee cards
frankly suck, you know?

00:22:39.021 --> 00:22:40.520
Like, that's not
where the value is.

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.520
So sometimes paying
an annual fee--

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.780
but dig into the benefits.

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:46.950
CLIFF REDEKER: And
percent, you know, like 1%

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:48.840
back may not always
be the best option

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.740
if you get that in cash versus
the value you have for travel.

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:52.000
BRIAN KELLY: Yeah.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:52.970
A lot of people call
me and say, well, I

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:54.320
have a Capital One card.

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.009
I'm getting 1% or 2% back.

00:22:56.009 --> 00:22:57.050
And those cards are fine.

00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:58.289
And those cards are great.

00:22:58.289 --> 00:22:59.080
But think about it.

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.330
You spend $100,000, and it'll
give you $2,000 in travel.

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:04.940
You spend $100,000 on a couple
other cards, you get bonuses,

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:06.939
you're going to Asia three
times in first class.

00:23:06.939 --> 00:23:09.860
So you can buy two
economy tickets

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:13.490
to Europe, or if you get
bonuses on other cards

00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:19.330
and transfer and get-- so the
fixed value cards are slow,

00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:19.830
steady.

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:21.160
There's no devaluations.

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:23.760
But there's also
little upside as well.

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:25.990
You're never going to get
more than a cent in value

00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:27.510
for a Capital One point, ever.

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:28.470
No matter who you are.

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:28.969
I can't.

00:23:28.969 --> 00:23:32.260
You know, like, so
with that stability

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:35.020
comes the lack of upside.

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:36.770
CLIFF REDEKER: Well,
and transitioning now

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:39.880
to thepointsguy.com,
the sort of media empire

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.390
that you're building here,
the first question I had

00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:44.570
is, how do you balance
information sharing

00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:45.570
with deal crashing?

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:47.414
Is the tragedy of the
commons inevitable?

00:23:47.414 --> 00:23:48.080
BRIAN KELLY: No.

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:53.980
I mean, we used to get a lot
of flak for posting deals.

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:55.700
In this day and age
of social media,

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:58.020
deals spread like wildfire.

00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:00.030
My take is if it's going
to benefit our readers,

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:00.670
then that's it.

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:01.670
We're going to share it.

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:03.920
Now if it's gray
area bending rules,

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:06.240
we're probably not going
to because our policy is,

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:08.073
let's just stay above
board with everything.

00:24:08.073 --> 00:24:10.830
And we have ethics that
we'd like to stick to.

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:11.369
But, yeah.

00:24:11.369 --> 00:24:12.660
In terms of deals, we share it.

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:13.770
That's the whole
point of the website.

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:15.603
That's why we've doubled
in size every year.

00:24:15.603 --> 00:24:17.880
And that's why people
come to us and trust us.

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:20.560
We don't take freebies
from any airlines.

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:23.960
All of our reviews are
paid for by ourselves.

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:25.760
So I stick to that.

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:29.910
And people who come
into it and then-- this

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:31.700
is an amazing, amazing hobby.

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:32.910
Whatever you want to call it.

00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:33.550
It's amazing.

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:35.758
Once you're part of the
club, like many other things,

00:24:35.758 --> 00:24:37.240
people want to shut
the doors down.

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:40.020
But that's not the
society we live in.

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:42.655
And there will
never be doors shut.

00:24:42.655 --> 00:24:44.280
I mean, yes, there's
some secret groups

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:46.238
out there for frequent
flyers that share deals,

00:24:46.238 --> 00:24:47.470
and that's great.

00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:50.580
But in general, we're going
to share the information.

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:53.359
And I mean, I thrive off of now.

00:24:53.359 --> 00:24:55.150
I mean, I see people
every day in airports.

00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:57.470
I'm six foot, 7",
so I'm easy to spot.

00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:58.980
And people share stories.

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:00.350
All of our email's positive.

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:02.000
People whose lives
have been changed.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:02.860
CLIFF REDEKER: Reader
success stories.

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:03.650
BRIAN KELLY: Reader
success stories

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:05.240
of people who got
married and, you know,

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:07.300
their rocky, long-distance
relationship all of the sudden

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:08.540
became a lot more
doable, because they were

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:09.706
able to see each other more.

00:25:09.706 --> 00:25:12.850
So that's what I focus on.

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:14.184
Not the naysayers or the trolls.

00:25:14.184 --> 00:25:15.558
CLIFF REDEKER:
No, no the haters.

00:25:15.558 --> 00:25:16.440
Yeah, no haters.

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:18.130
And then if you want to
share a little bit more

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:19.880
about the sort of
business side of things,

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:24.290
like is there a dollar figure of
money that circulates through?

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:27.400
Like, is the referral bonus
sustainable for bloggers?

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.150
BRIAN KELLY: Yeah.

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:30.667
I mean, the business that
we've created is really unique.

00:25:30.667 --> 00:25:32.000
It's affiliate marketing, right?

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.580
So almost all of
our revenue comes

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:36.530
from people who get credit
cards on our websites.

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:39.880
Or motto is, we have a
staff of about 10 now,

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:44.060
and 20 contributors that we
pay I think pretty fairly.

00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:45.540
But you know, the site's free.

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:47.620
So even the app is free.

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:51.080
And it costs a lot of money
to run this business, office

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:51.789
in New York.

00:25:51.789 --> 00:25:53.080
So the affiliate model's great.

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:56.740
I mean, our readers, you're
going to get the best offer.

00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:59.890
So it's like, if you can give
a credit card company $100

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:01.720
or give The Points
Guy, that we'll

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:03.600
invest in more
content that's suited

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.950
to you, that's a no-brainer.

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:07.560
And credit card
companies in the past,

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:10.620
the best we've been
given-- had issues with,

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:12.630
is the best offer
really being available?

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:16.660
I stand by-- we offer the
best publicly available deal.

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:18.880
Yeah, sometimes you
can go incognito

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:20.790
in the checkout
process, and maybe

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:24.030
get a special offer that you
can kind of tweak the system.

00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:25.405
But we can't, in
a blog post when

00:26:25.405 --> 00:26:27.080
we're writing about a deal, we
write about the best publicly

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:27.900
available offer.

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:30.922
So sometimes you can tweak
the system to get better,

00:26:30.922 --> 00:26:32.380
and people will
say-- but I'm like,

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:33.360
we have three million readers.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:33.820
I can't.

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:35.778
In every blog post, we're
talking about United,

00:26:35.778 --> 00:26:38.390
say, well maybe if some
people go through this channel

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:40.510
and tweak it this
way-- so in general,

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:42.090
we offer the best deals.

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:46.010
And the business is amazing.

00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:46.740
I'm proud of it.

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:49.450
And we're heavily
investing in video now.

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:52.100
We just relaunched our
TPG TV series, which

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:53.440
follows me around the world.

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:56.480
And it's not just, oh, look
at me drinking champagne

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:59.100
on a plane, which is fun.

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:02.940
But it's like tangible--
we cut the size down,

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:06.807
and it's tangible tricks
that you can also share.

00:27:06.807 --> 00:27:08.890
Like "How to Book Singapore
Suites in 90 Seconds,"

00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:10.560
which was released this week.

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:12.960
"What's the Best Hyatt in
Tokyo" is coming out next week.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.670
So we take a look at all three
of the major Hyatt's points,

00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:16.460
locations.

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:19.270
So we're trying to help
consumers make better decisions

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:20.834
with their points via video.

00:27:20.834 --> 00:27:23.250
CLIFF REDEKER: Is there anything
that people may not fully

00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:24.750
appreciate about TPG TV?

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:27.130
Is it a different experience
when you go into the Hyatts

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:27.976
with a camera crew?

00:27:27.976 --> 00:27:29.350
And how do you
keep objectivity--

00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:31.350
BRIAN KELLY: You know we do
have get permissions to fly.

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:32.410
And I actually didn't
think the airlines were

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:33.660
going to let us film on board.

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:36.410
But almost every single
airline has allowed us to film

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:37.407
on board.

00:27:37.407 --> 00:27:38.990
I mean, I think at
the end of the day,

00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:40.990
the product is what
you want to see.

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:41.876
And I'm six foot 7".

00:27:41.876 --> 00:27:44.000
So whenever I fly in a
product, if I'm comfortable,

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.840
like, chances are you
probably will be too.

00:27:48.752 --> 00:27:51.210
And really, it's not about the
flight review as much as how

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:54.420
you can actually fly to Africa
for $5.60 using Delta miles.

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:56.980
That's one of the best
ways-- Delta miles are really

00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:58.660
devalued, but to
Africa, it's amazing.

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:02.350
So they fly JFK to Accra.

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:03.350
And Africa's amazing.

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:05.183
Probably one of my
favorite places to visit.

00:28:05.183 --> 00:28:07.440
So the point of TPG TV
on flying Delta to Accra

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.800
is showing the product.

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:11.905
It's a pretty decent
business class product.

00:28:11.905 --> 00:28:12.580
So, yeah.

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:15.400
I mean, tweaking video's
an interesting beast.

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:17.999
And obviously, we
hear in social media,

00:28:17.999 --> 00:28:19.040
it's video, video, video.

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:20.590
We see all of our
major news networks

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:22.526
now switching to video
and Facebook Live.

00:28:22.526 --> 00:28:24.400
So I think we're adapting
and we're learning.

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:27.740
But I think we've gotten great
feedback on the episodes.

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:30.275
And it's meant to
entertain and educate.

00:28:30.275 --> 00:28:31.650
CLIFF REDEKER:
And like you said,

00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:33.066
there's a big
education component.

00:28:33.066 --> 00:28:36.211
So it's not like, what's
best dim sum in Hong Kong,

00:28:36.211 --> 00:28:36.710
necessarily.

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:38.980
Like, there's other ways
to get that information.

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:39.280
BRIAN KELLY: Yeah.

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:41.738
So we do have some of those
fun-- like the robot restaurant

00:28:41.738 --> 00:28:43.354
and eating blowfish in Osaka.

00:28:43.354 --> 00:28:44.520
CLIFF REDEKER: You survived.

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.010
BRIAN KELLY: Yeah, I survived.

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:48.382
Fugu blowfish is
actually amazing.

00:28:48.382 --> 00:28:50.090
I highly recommend
it, but only at, like,

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:51.110
the right restaurants.

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:52.890
So stay tuned for
the TPG TV episode

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:54.980
where we tell you the right
one to go to in Osaka.

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:55.350
CLIFF REDEKER: Nice.

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:55.850
Nice.

00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:56.599
Very cool.

00:28:56.599 --> 00:28:58.390
So I have some questions
about travel life,

00:28:58.390 --> 00:29:00.370
but if you all in the audience
have some questions as well,

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:02.036
we'll have a mic that
circulates around.

00:29:02.036 --> 00:29:03.780
So raise your hand.

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:07.830
We'll seek you out
and toss it your way.

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:13.350
So you know, travel life,
how do you value the effort

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:14.680
behind getting these points?

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:16.179
Like, are there
diminishing returns?

00:29:16.179 --> 00:29:19.200
Like, how do you calculate
these monthly valuations

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.310
that you post on TV?

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:22.600
BRIAN KELLY: Yeah, so we do
a monthly valuation where

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:24.764
we-- basically, it's a ranking.

00:29:24.764 --> 00:29:26.430
Not all points are
created equal, right?

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:28.555
Some point currencies are
much, much more valuable.

00:29:28.555 --> 00:29:30.450
Like, Starwood points
are the most valuable.

00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:33.230
And then on the flip side,
like, Spirit Airlines rewards,

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:38.156
like, expire after a week
if you don't punch yourself

00:29:38.156 --> 00:29:38.655
in the face.

00:29:38.655 --> 00:29:40.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.801
We're going to make them
much more scientific.

00:29:43.801 --> 00:29:45.300
But the thing is
with these, there's

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:47.716
billions of permutations of
how you can use points, right?

00:29:47.716 --> 00:29:49.840
Some people would rather
go twice in economy.

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:52.440
You know, and I've just flown
the Latun-- or the Qantas

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:52.940
first class.

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:54.398
It was a $9,000
ticket, and I spent

00:29:54.398 --> 00:29:55.950
$42, which sounds amazing.

00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:58.020
But you know, I wasn't
going to spend 18 grand

00:29:58.020 --> 00:29:59.820
to fly because I have
millions of miles,

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:01.080
so what's the real value?

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.931
There is no right answer.

00:30:02.931 --> 00:30:04.680
But the fact of the
matter is that a bunch

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:06.055
of other people
on that plane did

00:30:06.055 --> 00:30:09.450
spend $9,000, or at least full
fare business and upgraded.

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:12.980
So the value of
miles is amazing.

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:16.980
But we're going to be
trying to put a little bit

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:20.320
more technology into
the ease of redeeming.

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:21.820
But at the end of
the day, you know,

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:23.361
there's always
surveys that come out.

00:30:23.361 --> 00:30:25.280
The best frequent flyer
miles in the world

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:27.215
are-- and it's like
Southwest, because you

00:30:27.215 --> 00:30:28.340
can use it on every flight.

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:28.964
I'm like, yeah.

00:30:28.964 --> 00:30:32.474
But Southwest is pointless if
you want to go to Australia,

00:30:32.474 --> 00:30:34.140
or don't want to fly
coach domestically.

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:38.230
So there's no one right program.

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:41.212
And for me, I mean, it's all
on the credit card spend.

00:30:41.212 --> 00:30:42.670
That's how I make
most of my miles.

00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:44.020
I also do buy a lot of miles.

00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:48.800
So Alaska Airlines sells points
or miles for about $0.02 a pop.

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:51.830
So my 70,000 miles I used
for the one-way Qantas first

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:53.950
cost me about $1,400.

00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:56.140
So you can buy miles,
and airlines still

00:30:56.140 --> 00:31:00.340
drastically discount miles to
usually around $0.02 a pop.

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:04.169
So if you value miles
or need to top up,

00:31:04.169 --> 00:31:05.960
buying miles can still
make a lot of sense.

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:08.279
But just be warned,
when you buy miles,

00:31:08.279 --> 00:31:09.570
they could devalue at any time.

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:12.480
So have a plan of
attack when using them,

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.580
and know how to use them.

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:15.690
CLIFF REDEKER: And even the
posting, the delay for posting

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:17.660
can be something that
you need to worry about.

00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:18.410
BRIAN KELLY: Yeah.

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:20.856
CLIFF REDEKER: With the
transferable credit cards.

00:31:20.856 --> 00:31:22.730
And of course, you know,
your work is travel.

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:23.800
Travel is your work.

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:27.010
How do you balance your
sort of personal life

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:28.601
with the jet-setting adventures?

00:31:28.601 --> 00:31:29.350
BRIAN KELLY: Yeah.

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:30.390
That's hard.

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:31.403
I'm still learning.

00:31:31.403 --> 00:31:32.134
[LAUGH]

00:31:32.134 --> 00:31:34.550
Because I actually was sitting
on the plane the other day.

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:35.924
I'm like, I'm
addicted to travel.

00:31:35.924 --> 00:31:38.090
Like, I flew to
Auckland for three days,

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:39.930
and then flew in on Tuesday.

00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:41.490
And we had a
300-person event in LA.

00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:44.420
And people were like,
who's this monster?

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:45.880
Like, how do you
just keep going?

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:48.052
But it's what I love, too.

00:31:48.052 --> 00:31:48.760
And it's amazing.

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:50.470
With points, flying
first and business class

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:52.678
to Australia for three days
isn't that big of a deal.

00:31:52.678 --> 00:31:54.520
I actually wasn't hung--
or, not hung over.

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:57.300
I wasn't jet lagged at all.

00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:57.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:58.450
CLIFF REDEKER:
That Qantas lounge

00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:00.400
in LAX, though, they've
got the ice wine.

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:01.230
I'm just saying.

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:01.950
BRIAN KELLY: I actually
didn't drink at all.

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:04.602
I'm writing my first book
on points and my stories.

00:32:04.602 --> 00:32:06.060
So the whole point
of this trip was

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:08.950
to sequester myself with
no Wi-Fi, which Qantas

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:10.080
doesn't have, thankfully.

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:12.330
And I actually got a ton of
writing done on the plane.

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:14.345
So that's actually what
I love about travel.

00:32:14.345 --> 00:32:16.840
On the ground, so I'm on
Snapchat, Twitter, Facebook,

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:17.440
Instagram.

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:21.420
Constant employees
nagging me all the time.

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:23.150
And I actually just
want to raise--

00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:23.450
CLIFF REDEKER: We've got some--

00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:25.560
BRIAN KELLY: We've got my
editorial director James Cury.

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:25.790
Here.

00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:26.860
He manages all of our content.

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:28.200
He came from "Details" magazine.

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:31.930
Scott Kidder, who's my CEO,
came from a site, Gawker Media.

00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:34.514
And Kate, who's my longest
standing employee--

00:32:34.514 --> 00:32:36.180
I don't even know
what she does anymore.

00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:38.620
She's basically the
wizard behind the machine

00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:40.610
that, like, makes
everything run on the site.

00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:42.359
She knows where all
the bodies are buried.

00:32:42.359 --> 00:32:44.914
So I can't not have her around.

00:32:44.914 --> 00:32:45.930
CLIFF REDEKER: Cool.

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:47.471
BRIAN KELLY: She's
also the co-parent

00:32:47.471 --> 00:32:48.600
of my cute dog, Miles.

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:50.310
CLIFF REDEKER: Who unfortunately
could not make it today.

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:51.560
Google's a dog-friendly place.

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:52.220
But next time.

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:54.094
BRIAN KELLY: I didn't
want to be overshadowed

00:32:54.094 --> 00:32:57.232
by my adorably cute blue French
bulldog, is the real reason.

00:32:57.232 --> 00:32:58.440
CLIFF REDEKER: As it happens.

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:00.680
What would you say your
philosophy of travel is?

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:01.970
Like, when you go to
a new destination,

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:02.770
how do you approach it?

00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:03.644
What do you look for?

00:33:03.644 --> 00:33:06.180
BRIAN KELLY: Yeah,
unlike some people

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:07.880
who are addicted
in the travel, I

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:10.305
travel because I do
love the destination.

00:33:10.305 --> 00:33:11.970
You know, being
on airplanes, even

00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:15.340
in the best first-class
cabin is still exhausting,

00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:17.060
tiring on your body.

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:20.970
But the world, there's just so
much-- there's so many amazing

00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:26.330
places to see in the world
that it's worth it to me.

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:27.750
So I travel for the destination.

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:28.833
It brings family together.

00:33:28.833 --> 00:33:31.892
I just took my parents to Africa
using points, first class.

00:33:31.892 --> 00:33:34.350
So they didn't even feel guilty
that I spent a ton of money

00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:35.477
on them.

00:33:35.477 --> 00:33:37.810
But I'm closer with my parents
now because of that trip.

00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:40.018
The trip was life changing
in so many different ways.

00:33:40.018 --> 00:33:41.952
So travel changes your life.

00:33:41.952 --> 00:33:43.910
I wish more people would
travel and kind of get

00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:46.640
the world mindset.

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:49.320
And it also helps realize, we
do have a lot of things amazing

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:51.665
here, but there's a lot
of things we can change.

00:33:51.665 --> 00:33:53.800
The blanket statement,
America's the best.

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:56.370
Like, it's not actually
true when you see the world.

00:33:56.370 --> 00:33:59.220
CLIFF REDEKER: And it's
moving beyond the room service

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:01.620
and the hotel
restaurant to see what

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:03.161
life is like on the grounds.

00:34:03.161 --> 00:34:03.660
Cool.

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:06.542
Are there audience
questions at this time?

00:34:06.542 --> 00:34:08.199
Any burning questions so far?

00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:11.020
If not, you can
hold them for later.

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:15.360
I did have a question
from Angela, in fact.

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:18.179
What travel experiences have
influenced your future travel

00:34:18.179 --> 00:34:20.870
destinations, and why?

00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:23.120
BRIAN KELLY: Well, actually,
I have a fear of heights,

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:25.263
which is kind of funny.

00:34:25.263 --> 00:34:27.179
Someone actually tweeted
me, isn't that ironic

00:34:27.179 --> 00:34:30.086
that you're really tall
and afraid of heights?

00:34:30.086 --> 00:34:31.960
But I've been confronting
my fear of heights.

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:34.780
I did hot air ballooning
in Turkey in Cappadocia.

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:37.929
I highly recommend--
maybe wait a little while

00:34:37.929 --> 00:34:38.900
as things settle down.

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:40.941
But actually, Turkey's
still a great destination.

00:34:40.941 --> 00:34:43.111
We had one of our
writers there last week.

00:34:43.111 --> 00:34:45.610
And I think it's kind of fun
to travel to conquer your fear.

00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:47.152
So in Auckland, I
jumped off of the--

00:34:47.152 --> 00:34:48.193
CLIFF REDEKER: Oh, right.

00:34:48.193 --> 00:34:49.040
The Sky Tower.

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:51.399
BRIAN KELLY: The SkyJump,
which was terrifying.

00:34:51.399 --> 00:34:53.690
And being at the edge-- it
was pulling me off the edge.

00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:56.164
And the guy was like, put
both feet at the edge.

00:34:56.164 --> 00:34:57.580
And I'm like, it's
pulling me off.

00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:58.650
Am I unhooked yet?

00:34:58.650 --> 00:34:59.820
Like, I was panicking.

00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:02.832
But you know, the 10-second
almost free fall was amazing.

00:35:02.832 --> 00:35:05.290
So now I actually have skydiving
on the list, which I never

00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:06.242
thought I would do.

00:35:06.242 --> 00:35:08.200
So travel for me, I still
like to be pushed out

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.650
of my comfort zone.

00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:11.570
My main place that
I love visiting

00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:13.250
is the continent of Africa.

00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:17.935
It is so unbelievably-- it's
inspiring, breathtaking.

00:35:17.935 --> 00:35:20.310
Safari's probably been-- I
just took my parents on safari

00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:22.330
in Tanzania.

00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:24.830
Sabi Sands and
Kruger's a great place.

00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:25.680
Go to South Africa.

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:27.638
If you guys are looking
for travel inspiration,

00:35:27.638 --> 00:35:30.500
South Africa is incredibly
affordable once you get there,

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:31.490
and it's everything.

00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:33.190
You know, Cape Town's
a European city

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:35.066
on the beach with penguins.

00:35:35.066 --> 00:35:36.690
You can drive to the
Cape of Good Hope.

00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:38.920
The wine country
outside of Cape Town

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:43.410
is unbelievably,
insanely beautiful wines.

00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:44.550
And it's so affordable.

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:47.321
The dollar is so
strong against Iran.

00:35:47.321 --> 00:35:49.320
And getting their on miles
is doable, especially

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.300
with the Middle
Eastern carriers.

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:53.800
CLIFF REDEKER: And the
A380 to Johannesburg now.

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:54.990
BRIAN KELLY: Yes.

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:57.300
So, yeah.

00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:58.150
On Etihad right now.

00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.725
CLIFF REDEKER: Yeah.

00:35:58.725 --> 00:35:59.516
Or Emirates, right?

00:35:59.516 --> 00:36:00.829
BRIAN KELLY: On Emirates, yeah.

00:36:00.829 --> 00:36:02.620
CLIFF REDEKER: And do
you still scuba dive?

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:04.410
I saw, like, the
progress of lessons,

00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:05.640
and haven't seen many posts.

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:06.806
BRIAN KELLY: That was crazy.

00:36:06.806 --> 00:36:07.840
So I love scuba diving.

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:11.240
So the world is more covered
in water than it is land.

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:14.530
So underwater is
unbelievably beautiful.

00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:16.740
I got scuba certified
for a year and a half.

00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:19.220
It was Great Barrier
Reef, Maldives.

00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:21.400
My favorite dive actually
was in the Cayman Islands.

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:22.340
It was like a video game.

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:24.340
It was a cavern, and we
were just going through.

00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:27.040
And it was an absolute video
game of things I've never seen.

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:27.940
And I love sharks.

00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:29.065
They're my favorite animal.

00:36:29.065 --> 00:36:31.760
And you realize sharks,
like, don't give

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:33.130
a crap at all about people.

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:36.090
This whole fear about sharks
is really interesting.

00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:38.930
But unfortunately, in
Maui, I was diving,

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:41.550
and the next day, I felt like
there was water in my ear,

00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:44.777
and ended up going
deaf for nine days.

00:36:44.777 --> 00:36:46.360
Completely deaf in
my right ear, which

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:48.693
apparently is a freak thing
that happens to some people.

00:36:48.693 --> 00:36:52.279
Because I tweeted about it,
and a couple other people--

00:36:52.279 --> 00:36:54.070
they said I may never
have my hearing back.

00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:55.850
I went to three
different hospitals,

00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:58.630
and they had to put a
syringe into my ear drum,

00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:00.600
and pumped it full of steroids.

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.330
Which actually worked
two days later.

00:37:02.330 --> 00:37:04.860
I was at dinner, and
I heard a crackle.

00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:06.982
And then it finally came
back, pretty much 100%.

00:37:06.982 --> 00:37:08.440
CLIFF REDEKER:
That's good to hear.

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:10.064
BRIAN KELLY: Not to
be a Debbie downer.

00:37:10.064 --> 00:37:11.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:13.440
But I will get back
in the water one day.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:14.820
But not quite yet.

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:15.180
CLIFF REDEKER: That's OK.

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:16.090
BRIAN KELLY: Are you a diver?

00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:18.220
CLIFF REDEKER: Actually, I just
got my open water certification

00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:19.267
at South Beach Divers.

00:37:19.267 --> 00:37:20.350
BRIAN KELLY: Oh, the one--

00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:20.740
CLIFF REDEKER: Yeah.

00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:21.470
BRIAN KELLY: Yeah, the
one that I went to.

00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:21.950
CLIFF REDEKER: Yeah.

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:22.190
Yeah.

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:23.480
It worked out pretty well.

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.577
So I have it,
like, on the ready.

00:37:25.577 --> 00:37:27.910
So the next time I go to the
South Pacific or something,

00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:29.250
I can just hop on in.

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:30.910
BRIAN KELLY: I
highly recommend it.

00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:33.534
Everyone thinks you're going to
be claustrophobic in breathing.

00:37:33.534 --> 00:37:36.360
And you'll get over it,
and it's totally worth it.

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:39.150
It is very dangerous, though,
so take it very seriously.

00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:40.880
I almost died once or twice.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:42.338
CLIFF REDEKER: Read
the directions.

00:37:42.338 --> 00:37:43.046
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:43.046 --> 00:37:45.260
So also, one of the things
that we're doing here

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:47.480
at Google, our
GooglersGive team helps

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:50.200
us donate our time, money,
and effort to various causes.

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:53.110
And so we have a badge to
donate station for the Points

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:55.260
for Peace in the PeaceJam.

00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:57.810
And so I wanted to just talk
to you a little bit about that.

00:37:57.810 --> 00:37:59.070
How did you get started on that?

00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:00.695
What's been the sort of
rewarding experiences

00:38:00.695 --> 00:38:01.540
you've seen from it?

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:02.540
BRIAN KELLY: Oh my gosh.

00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:04.620
PeaceJam-- so the
business was successful.

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:06.510
And finding a charity
is kind of hard.

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:09.005
Like, everyone's like,
what's your ultimate passion

00:38:09.005 --> 00:38:09.530
in charity?

00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:11.940
And you're like, I mean,
I'm a giving person,

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:13.979
and it's hard to pick
a charity that aligns

00:38:13.979 --> 00:38:15.020
with what you love doing.

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:17.470
And I think charity work is
just much like your work life,

00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:17.970
right?

00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:20.469
So once you really align and
figure out what you love doing,

00:38:20.469 --> 00:38:23.220
you'll succeed much quicker than
randomly being placed in a job.

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:25.312
So you know, charity
for me for a while

00:38:25.312 --> 00:38:27.020
was just writing checks
to organizations,

00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:29.100
but I realized that
wasn't very fulfilling.

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:30.940
A friend came to me
one day and was like,

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:31.860
I have to talk to you.

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:33.530
In college, I was
involved with PeaceJam.

00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:34.946
I think you'll
absolutely love it.

00:38:34.946 --> 00:38:38.880
So PeaceJam is an
organization that Meng,

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:40.887
the former Jolly Good
Fellow of Google,

00:38:40.887 --> 00:38:42.720
who I've been working
with-- so he now works

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:45.320
with PeaceJam full time on this
Billion Acts of Peace campaign.

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:47.611
The whole point is taking
the work of Nobel Peace Prize

00:38:47.611 --> 00:38:49.780
winners, 13 of the most
inspiring in the world--

00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:53.359
Dalai Lama, Desmond
Tutu, Rigoberta Menchu--

00:38:53.359 --> 00:38:55.150
taking their teachings,
making a curriculum

00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:56.200
to kids around the world.

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:57.980
So Points for Peace
was launched this year

00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:00.563
with the hopes of having people
be able to donate their points

00:39:00.563 --> 00:39:01.630
and miles, their money.

00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:03.671
You can actually earn
points by using your credit

00:39:03.671 --> 00:39:05.187
card to donate for them.

00:39:05.187 --> 00:39:07.520
And I think we can all agree
the world needs more peace,

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:08.670
more so than ever.

00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:10.720
And as much as we
want to put our head

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:14.660
in the sand with crazy
news stories every day,

00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:16.070
it's not all terrible.

00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:17.181
It's so inspiring.

00:39:17.181 --> 00:39:18.930
There's youth around
the world that really

00:39:18.930 --> 00:39:20.630
want to make a difference.

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:24.300
So in Ghana-- yeah.

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:25.790
So through Points
for Peace, we're

00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:29.540
helping in Guatemala,
Ghana, South Africa, India,

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:30.850
and East Timor.

00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:33.006
There's these budding
movements of kids there

00:39:33.006 --> 00:39:34.630
who learn all year
long the curriculum,

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:36.838
and then we bring and use
points to bring the Nobels,

00:39:36.838 --> 00:39:39.365
and they do two-day
jams, the PeaceJam.

00:39:39.365 --> 00:39:40.490
So I was working with Meng.

00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:42.490
We're bringing it to Singapore.

00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:43.366
And it's amazing.

00:39:43.366 --> 00:39:45.490
I'm mean, to be able to
see these Nobel Peace Prize

00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:48.037
winners who have been
through-- you think

00:39:48.037 --> 00:39:49.120
you've been through a lot.

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:51.495
You hear-- you know, Rigoberta
Menchu, whose whole family

00:39:51.495 --> 00:39:54.410
was assassinated during the
36-year civil war in Guatemala.

00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:56.550
And for me, even being
able to be around them,

00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:57.690
I get so much out of it.

00:39:57.690 --> 00:39:59.640
So we're bringing
these Nobels to kids

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:01.420
to help them better
their communities,

00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:03.720
and hopefully create
a whole new generation

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:05.367
of nonviolent leaders.

00:40:05.367 --> 00:40:06.950
So Points for Peace,
we just launched.

00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:09.390
And we're working with
all the credit card

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:10.470
companies and airlines.

00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:12.303
You know, they all have
their own charities,

00:40:12.303 --> 00:40:15.910
and it's political, but
we're making great progress.

00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:17.970
You Singapore Airlines
just did a match.

00:40:17.970 --> 00:40:21.580
If any of you have Singapore
Airlines miles, up to 250,000

00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:22.430
donated.

00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:23.890
You can even donate
1,000 of them.

00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:25.580
They'll match to us.

00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:27.610
And the airlines are
on board with it.

00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:33.562
So it's our first year, but
I foresee us growing it.

00:40:33.562 --> 00:40:35.020
And at a certain
point, I was like,

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:37.400
we've just got to launch
and continue to evolve it.

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:39.060
CLIFF REDEKER: And there's a
spot for readers too to, like,

00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:40.226
lend their travel expertise.

00:40:40.226 --> 00:40:41.905
Like, be a volunteer,
point maximizers.

00:40:41.905 --> 00:40:43.530
BRIAN KELLY: So the
goal is that people

00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:45.240
will be able to donate
points-- right now,

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:46.156
you can donate points.

00:40:46.156 --> 00:40:48.490
So if someone said, I have
20,000 British Airways Avios,

00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:50.447
where you actually use
that to fly two PeaceJam

00:40:50.447 --> 00:40:52.032
staffers to Guatemala,
because that's

00:40:52.032 --> 00:40:54.240
the best use of British
Airways on short-haul flights

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:55.270
on American.

00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:57.750
So we have people who have
knowledge on how to use points,

00:40:57.750 --> 00:41:00.230
and then we have
people donating points.

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:02.460
So our goal is to just
grow, and have these growing

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:04.020
pools of points to help.

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:07.850
Because frankly, charities
really get killed with travel.

00:41:07.850 --> 00:41:09.350
Travel is really
hard for charities,

00:41:09.350 --> 00:41:10.840
especially when you're going
to the developing world.

00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:13.190
Just to send one conference
staffer to East Timor

00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:14.660
is like $3,000.

00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:18.130
But it's only, like,
70,000 United miles.

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:21.410
So we're helping
maximize miles for good

00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:23.400
is the general point
of Points for Peace.

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:25.108
CLIFF REDEKER: And
you can check that out

00:41:25.108 --> 00:41:27.850
at the table in the back, or
also on The Points Guy website.

00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:28.530
BRIAN KELLY: And
none of the money

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:30.590
actually goes to the Points--
it all goes to PeaceJam.

00:41:30.590 --> 00:41:32.060
The Points for Peace
is just the initiative.

00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:33.893
So we're not trying to
create a new charity.

00:41:33.893 --> 00:41:36.100
We're just trying to help
charities that already

00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:38.260
have something amazing
going on, and to take it

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:39.050
to the next level.

00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:39.418
CLIFF REDEKER: All right.

00:41:39.418 --> 00:41:40.130
Cool.

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:42.046
So if there's any questions
from the audience,

00:41:42.046 --> 00:41:43.290
feel free to raise your hand.

00:41:43.290 --> 00:41:45.290
Any news from the
Google moderator, Adam?

00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:51.010
AUDIENCE: So you talked
a bunch about how

00:41:51.010 --> 00:41:53.270
getting credit cards with
a sign-up bonus [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:55.130
can give you a lot of miles.

00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:56.990
And we have a couple
of Googlers here

00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:59.620
who wanted to know a bit more
about, how do you personally

00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:02.070
keep track of your
credit Cards And along

00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:03.488
with that, the points?

00:42:03.488 --> 00:42:05.696
You have a certain spend by
a certain amount of time,

00:42:05.696 --> 00:42:06.204
and so on.

00:42:06.204 --> 00:42:07.870
BRIAN KELLY: So I
want to be clear, too.

00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:09.703
With the credit card--
getting credit cards,

00:42:09.703 --> 00:42:11.870
you have to be on
your game, right?

00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:13.560
You need to pay attention.

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:16.170
One missed payment--
granted, you can usually

00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:18.365
ask for forgiveness, but
it can be ver complex.

00:42:18.365 --> 00:42:20.690
So I have 26 credit cards.

00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:22.757
You know, points.com,
Award Wallet,

00:42:22.757 --> 00:42:24.340
there are great ways
to kind of track.

00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:26.395
Our app, the TPG
To Go, actually you

00:42:26.395 --> 00:42:28.020
can tell us what
credit cards you have,

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:30.561
and we'll actually tell you when
your annual fee's coming up,

00:42:30.561 --> 00:42:33.150
and make sure if any
points are going to expire.

00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:35.430
But frankly, I mean,
I have a spreadsheet,

00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:36.480
kind of old fashioned.

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:39.450
And Kate here is
probably giggling.

00:42:39.450 --> 00:42:42.030
Luckily, Kate's not
my assistant anymore.

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:44.040
But I have people
who help me track.

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:46.512
Because it is a lot of time.

00:42:46.512 --> 00:42:48.220
And of course, I'm
over the top because I

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:51.670
need to test out every
credit card, and whatnot.

00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:53.922
So, yeah.

00:42:53.922 --> 00:42:55.380
And with applying
for credit cards,

00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:57.570
there is a small two to
five point, you know,

00:42:57.570 --> 00:42:59.290
temporary ding on your credit.

00:42:59.290 --> 00:43:02.320
But people think-- you hear the
Suze Ormans of the world that

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:04.280
are like, pay cash
for everything,

00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:05.902
and credit cards are the devil.

00:43:05.902 --> 00:43:06.610
And I understand.

00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:09.005
A lot of Americans are in debt.

00:43:09.005 --> 00:43:10.880
And the goal is, if
you're carrying balances,

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:13.570
do not get miles and
points credit cards.

00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:15.570
Focus first and foremost
on getting debt-free.

00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:17.070
Because if you're
carrying balances,

00:43:17.070 --> 00:43:19.270
the crazy APRs, even on
the best credit cards,

00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:21.240
are going to negate the
value of those points.

00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:24.086
So the number one goal should
be to get debt-free and get

00:43:24.086 --> 00:43:26.460
to a place where you can put
everything on a credit card,

00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:28.450
but pay it off in
full every month.

00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:29.450
That's winning the game.

00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:31.830
So there are a lot
of credit cards

00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:34.040
that will, if you
have a balance,

00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:37.340
focus on neutralizing that
debt before getting into it.

00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:40.730
But it still does
take a bunch of time.

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:42.700
There's no one perfect
app or software

00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:44.197
out there that
will do it for you.

00:43:44.197 --> 00:43:45.030
CLIFF REDEKER: Cool.

00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:46.696
AUDIENCE: What are
your thoughts on some

00:43:46.696 --> 00:43:49.670
of the rumored new credit cards
coming out from Chase Sapphire

00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:52.000
Reserve and things like that?

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.580
Is that worth waiting out
for, especially if you're

00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:57.060
close to that 5/24 rule?

00:43:57.060 --> 00:43:57.860
BRIAN KELLY: Yeah.

00:43:57.860 --> 00:43:59.880
So there's a rumor.

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:02.330
I've actually asked
Chase for conformation

00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:04.180
on the exact details,
but there's a rumor

00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:07.370
that-- Chase Sapphire
Preferred is my favorite card.

00:44:07.370 --> 00:44:09.180
If you're looking to
get a credit card,

00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:10.220
it's just a no-brainer.

00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:11.553
The fee's waived the first year.

00:44:11.553 --> 00:44:12.570
You get 50,000 points.

00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:14.370
You cannot lose getting
that card, right?

00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:16.328
And you get double points
on travel and dining.

00:44:16.328 --> 00:44:19.530
There's rumors of an even better
card coming out next month,

00:44:19.530 --> 00:44:21.260
which makes sense, right?

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:25.045
You would think,
Citi's got a $450 card.

00:44:25.045 --> 00:44:26.660
Amex has a $450.

00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:29.040
So for Chase to compete
for top-tier consumers,

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:30.130
it makes complete sense.

00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:35.740
So the card sounds amazing.

00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:38.070
Going back to the 5/24
rule where Chase is really

00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:40.040
clamping down, I
probably-- and that's

00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:42.530
the thing about
this game is that,

00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:43.947
don't go too much
too soon, right?

00:44:43.947 --> 00:44:46.113
If you're new to this, you
can get a ton of bonuses.

00:44:46.113 --> 00:44:47.524
But there's spend requirements.

00:44:47.524 --> 00:44:48.940
There is an impact
on your credit.

00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:51.160
The credit card companies
are becoming more savvy.

00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:52.701
If you open and
close, open and close

00:44:52.701 --> 00:44:56.520
and you're poking them in
the eye-- don't make yourself

00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:57.717
a bad customer, right?

00:44:57.717 --> 00:44:59.300
Because you can get
banned from banks.

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:01.570
Now in general, you won't.

00:45:01.570 --> 00:45:03.410
But be a good customer, right?

00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:08.707
Go slow and steady and
get your-- have a checking

00:45:08.707 --> 00:45:09.790
account with Chase, right?

00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:11.930
Like, throw them a couple
bones so on the whole,

00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:14.794
you're a good customer and
they keep doing these things.

00:45:14.794 --> 00:45:16.210
But yeah, and in
general, you used

00:45:16.210 --> 00:45:19.794
to be able to get the same card
bunches of different times.

00:45:19.794 --> 00:45:21.460
There's still some
credit card companies

00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:25.071
that will let you get the
same card over and over again.

00:45:25.071 --> 00:45:25.570
But, yeah.

00:45:25.570 --> 00:45:27.415
They are becoming smarter.

00:45:27.415 --> 00:45:28.320
Take that approach.

00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:31.130
And if you hear a rumor of an
amazing card coming out soon,

00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:35.076
and if it seems like a founded
rumor, you know, wait and see.

00:45:35.076 --> 00:45:36.700
You've got to think
big picture, right?

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:37.970
CLIFF REDEKER: There's
always another deal.

00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:38.720
BRIAN KELLY: There's
always another deal.

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:40.540
But all good deals
come to an end, right?

00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:43.760
So the more you wait, there
is an opportunity cost

00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:45.130
to waiting on that.

00:45:45.130 --> 00:45:45.410
CLIFF REDEKER: All right.

00:45:45.410 --> 00:45:46.910
We had a question
in the back there,

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:48.980
and then we'll grab
one here on the right.

00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:51.025
AUDIENCE: This is actually
a question from Ryan

00:45:51.025 --> 00:45:53.050
in our LAX Google office.

00:45:53.050 --> 00:45:55.390
Save reward versus
standard fare award.

00:45:55.390 --> 00:45:58.020
What's the best time
to buy save rewards?

00:45:58.020 --> 00:45:59.450
Six months out, two weeks out?

00:45:59.450 --> 00:46:01.040
What's the breakdown for that?

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:02.700
BRIAN KELLY: So save
rewards are awards

00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:04.033
at the very lowest level, right?

00:46:04.033 --> 00:46:06.645
So the goal is to always
find save rewards.

00:46:06.645 --> 00:46:08.270
Why give them more
miles than possible?

00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:13.060
So the problem is that the
airlines are holding them

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:14.720
back longer and
longer to departure,

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:17.550
because shockingly,
airlines are, in the US,

00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:20.845
publicly traded companies
that want to maximize profit.

00:46:20.845 --> 00:46:23.340
They want to offer save rewards
so they can advertise it.

00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:25.574
But for every single
person all the time,

00:46:25.574 --> 00:46:26.740
they want you to spend more.

00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:29.440
So this is going back to
the flexibility thing.

00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:33.149
If you're risk-averse, I would
say, book a standard award.

00:46:33.149 --> 00:46:34.690
You know, I actually
just booked one.

00:46:34.690 --> 00:46:35.782
I'm going to Europe.

00:46:35.782 --> 00:46:37.490
I want to fly on the
nonstop Rome flight.

00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:38.864
Rome to New York
on a certain day

00:46:38.864 --> 00:46:41.780
that I have to be home for
a big meeting the next day.

00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:44.040
I have an AA elite
status, so I booked

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:46.830
135,000 miles AA one way.

00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:48.410
It's a $4,000 ticket to buy.

00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:51.840
I don't want to connect randomly
in Dusseldorf for 12 hours.

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:54.820
So I have that 135k
standard award waiting,

00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:56.940
but I can change it
unlimited times for free,

00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:57.690
because I'm elite.

00:46:57.690 --> 00:46:59.810
And even if you're
not elite, AA,

00:46:59.810 --> 00:47:01.730
if they do open up
a save reward, which

00:47:01.730 --> 00:47:05.270
you can set an expert flier
alert, you can pay $150

00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:13.240
and get 57,500-- you know,
80,000 miles back, or whatever.

00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:15.350
And the same goes, you
know, if you fly Southwest,

00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:17.890
keep monitoring to make sure
that the price doesn't drop.

00:47:17.890 --> 00:47:19.800
Because all you do is call,
and you get a free credit

00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:20.990
in your account when it drops.

00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:23.156
There's actually, at our
app launch the other night,

00:47:23.156 --> 00:47:26.190
a new company called
Earny-- E-A-R-N-Y--

00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:29.099
which is an app that'll
consistently check,

00:47:29.099 --> 00:47:31.390
if you have purchase protection
and you purchase items,

00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:34.095
it'll keep checking for
price drop, for hotels.

00:47:34.095 --> 00:47:36.220
So it's a really fascinating--
I haven't checked it

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:38.390
out myself yet.

00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:43.250
But you can save tons of money
and miles by staying on it.

00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:44.770
And the week of
departure, airlines

00:47:44.770 --> 00:47:46.990
release tons and tons
of saver-level awards.

00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:49.540
So even if you're
booked on an American

00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:52.570
Air-- a US carrier
and their partner

00:47:52.570 --> 00:47:56.980
opens up-- almost always, I'd
say, go with Asian carriers

00:47:56.980 --> 00:48:00.120
or even European carriers
beat the US carriers.

00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:01.640
Not in all cases.

00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:04.560
AUDIENCE: For starters,
I'm not very spontaneous

00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:06.520
or a last-minute traveler.

00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:08.770
I want things planned before.

00:48:08.770 --> 00:48:15.690
How do I actually get
some [INAUDIBLE] fines?

00:48:15.690 --> 00:48:18.010
BRIAN KELLY: Yeah, you
can still plan ahead.

00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:19.280
I would just say, be flexible.

00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:23.240
If you have time-- or be
flexible on your destination.

00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:27.700
Or you can still
plan in advance.

00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:29.990
It's not all last minute, right?

00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:35.000
For last minute, to the winner
goes the spoils is amazing.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.080
But you can still
definitely plan in advance

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:39.680
and find save rewards.

00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:41.820
But if you are a little
bit-- the more flexible

00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:43.240
you are, the greater the reward.

00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:45.239
AUDIENCE: So here at
Google, fortunately, Google

00:48:45.239 --> 00:48:47.390
pays for almost everything
except for rent for us,

00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:51.480
so we may or may not have $4,000
of expenses in three months

00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:52.505
to meet a sign-up bonus.

00:48:52.505 --> 00:48:55.250
And you said you're not a huge
fan of manufacturing spending.

00:48:55.250 --> 00:48:59.505
So how would you
suggest that someone

00:48:59.505 --> 00:49:01.830
without a lot of the expenses
get the sign-up bonus?

00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:07.211
BRIAN KELLY: Yeah, I mean,
there are ways-- sometimes

00:49:07.211 --> 00:49:07.960
it may make sense.

00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:09.250
So you can pay rent.

00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:12.250
You know, most landlords
will charge a fee.

00:49:12.250 --> 00:49:19.570
So it may make sense to hit a
sign-up bonus to spend $3,000

00:49:19.570 --> 00:49:21.105
to pay, you know--

00:49:21.105 --> 00:49:21.980
CLIFF REDEKER: Taxes.

00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:22.938
BRIAN KELLY: Tax, yeah.

00:49:22.938 --> 00:49:26.070
Or even pay your taxes at 1.9%.

00:49:26.070 --> 00:49:29.350
To pay a little bit to
get the huge sign-up bonus

00:49:29.350 --> 00:49:30.180
can make sense.

00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:31.721
So as much as
manufactured spending's

00:49:31.721 --> 00:49:37.070
about getting it for free, don't
give cash gifts for weddings.

00:49:37.070 --> 00:49:38.860
Use your Amex and buy
an Amex gift card.

00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:42.670
There might be the $5.95 fee.

00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:44.030
Or give gift cards.

00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:46.430
You know, your nieces,
instead of giving them cash,

00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:49.210
buy a Bed Bath &amp; Beyond gift
card at an office supply

00:49:49.210 --> 00:49:50.380
store or a supermarket.

00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:51.484
So there are ways.

00:49:51.484 --> 00:49:52.900
I mean, but at the
end of the day,

00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:56.350
you do have to spend in
order to get the bonuses.

00:49:56.350 --> 00:49:59.610
But it may not be
completely free.

00:49:59.610 --> 00:50:03.444
But where we work, I was
paying rent directly.

00:50:03.444 --> 00:50:04.860
And then one day
I was like, well,

00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:05.930
let me just use a credit card.

00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:07.810
And WeWork takes credit
card with no fee.

00:50:07.810 --> 00:50:10.660
So now at $9,000 a
month-- so a lot of times

00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:14.670
it's just, once again, poking
around and pushing the status

00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:15.170
quo.

00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:16.595
And it never hurts to ask.

00:50:16.595 --> 00:50:17.470
CLIFF REDEKER: Right.

00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:19.247
So I wanted to wrap
up with a few sort

00:50:19.247 --> 00:50:20.420
of rapid-fire questions.

00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:22.704
We've got some
favorites and failures

00:50:22.704 --> 00:50:24.620
that you may have
experienced in your travels.

00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:28.430
So the first one, most
intriguing airline or hotel you

00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:31.020
have yet to experience.

00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:32.970
BRIAN KELLY: Intriguing,
yet to experience.

00:50:32.970 --> 00:50:34.386
CLIFF REDEKER:
Well, like, I mean,

00:50:34.386 --> 00:50:36.280
you probably haven't
flown Saudi yet, or--

00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:39.650
BRIAN KELLY: Well, I won't,
because it's a dry airline,

00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:41.940
and they don't like gay people.

00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:44.127
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:44.127 --> 00:50:45.335
Nothing against Saudi Arabia.

00:50:45.335 --> 00:50:48.470
It's just the truth.

00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:49.780
Where do I want to try?

00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:51.130
Oh, that's a good question.

00:50:51.130 --> 00:50:52.340
I like flying wonky carries.

00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:53.881
Like, I've flown,
like, Mauritius Air

00:50:53.881 --> 00:50:55.589
and Seychelles Air.

00:50:55.589 --> 00:50:57.380
I've actually never
flown Turkish Airlines.

00:50:57.380 --> 00:50:58.610
I hear they've got
a good product.

00:50:58.610 --> 00:50:59.030
CLIFF REDEKER: Nice.

00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.540
BRIAN KELLY: Good food.

00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:01.373
CLIFF REDEKER: And a
good lounge in Istanbul

00:51:01.373 --> 00:51:03.120
when things settle
down a little bit.

00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:06.180
Without considering any
possible points that you'd

00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:07.930
earn from the trip
or points that you'd

00:51:07.930 --> 00:51:11.260
redeem to go on the trip,
which destination stands out

00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:12.480
the most on it's own right?

00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:14.230
BRIAN KELLY: So South
Africa, hands down,

00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:18.190
is just my favorite,
all-around destination.

00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:21.690
And I love Spain, as
far as Europe goes.

00:51:21.690 --> 00:51:22.857
Beautiful, fun, inexpensive.

00:51:22.857 --> 00:51:24.940
CLIFF REDEKER: That's where
your correspondent is.

00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:25.500
Lori, right?

00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:28.570
BRIAN KELLY: International
correspondent, Lori Zaino.

00:51:28.570 --> 00:51:30.220
CLIFF REDEKER: So
what's the worst use

00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:33.510
of points that either
you've had to do yourself,

00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:35.990
or that people have that
people wouldn't normally think?

00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.420
BRIAN KELLY: Yeah.

00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:38.336
So when I worked on Wall
Street, funny enough,

00:51:38.336 --> 00:51:41.190
I was points rich and cash poor.

00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:42.870
So I used a bunch
of Delta miles.

00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:44.350
Used to be able to use,
like, half a cent a point

00:51:44.350 --> 00:51:45.010
for gift cards.

00:51:45.010 --> 00:51:46.810
So I was buying gift cards
to buy Christmas gifts,

00:51:46.810 --> 00:51:49.000
because to me at that point,
I didn't need another trip

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:49.749
to the Seychelles.

00:51:49.749 --> 00:51:53.290
I needed to get gifts for
people, and I had no money.

00:51:53.290 --> 00:51:55.261
I was, like, really broke.

00:51:55.261 --> 00:51:57.510
So merchandise is generally
not a great use of points.

00:51:57.510 --> 00:52:00.000
But another tenet is if
points make you happy

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.390
and it serves a need right
now, than do it, right?

00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:05.640
CLIFF REDEKER: If you need
that magazine subscription,

00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:08.290
get the magazine subscription.

00:52:08.290 --> 00:52:12.320
So rounding the corner here,
the most surprising difference

00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:13.717
between expectation and reality?

00:52:13.717 --> 00:52:15.800
So something you thought
was amazing, not so much.

00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:17.360
Or something not so
much, it was amazing.

00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:18.750
BRIAN KELLY: When I flew
the Etihad Residence,

00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:21.440
I actually paid $33,000 to fly
on a one-way flight from JFK

00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:22.740
to Abu Dhabi.

00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:24.330
They ended up losing my bag.

00:52:24.330 --> 00:52:25.750
Left it-- my carry-on bag.

00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:28.250
They left it in the lounge in
New York and didn't even know.

00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:30.532
So when I landed, I
waited an hour and a half,

00:52:30.532 --> 00:52:31.740
and they were like, oh, yeah.

00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:32.679
We left it in JFK.

00:52:32.679 --> 00:52:34.720
I'm like, whatever happened
if you see something,

00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:35.303
say something?

00:52:35.303 --> 00:52:36.910
How did no one at the lounge--

00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:38.817
CLIFF REDEKER:
Evacuate the terminal.

00:52:38.817 --> 00:52:40.900
BRIAN KELLY: So the Residence
experience was cool.

00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:43.070
You have your own
bedroom and bathroom.

00:52:43.070 --> 00:52:45.786
But it was nowhere
near worth $33,000.

00:52:45.786 --> 00:52:47.160
Although from a
business expense,

00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:49.826
it paid off, because we got over
a million views from the video.

00:52:49.826 --> 00:52:53.030
And people in the airport,
actually a concession worker

00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:55.150
goes, you're that
guy who paid $33,000.

00:52:55.150 --> 00:52:56.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:56.050 --> 00:52:58.670
So for the price of airport
fame, it was worth it.

00:52:58.670 --> 00:52:58.880
CLIFF REDEKER: Yeah.

00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:00.760
Otherwise, stick to the
apartment, which is fine.

00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:02.551
BRIAN KELLY: The
apartment, using AA miles.

00:53:02.551 --> 00:53:04.220
CLIFF REDEKER: So
most extreme points

00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:07.340
optimization that
you've ever done.

00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:08.840
BRIAN KELLY: I think
one of the best

00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:10.950
is-- so Marriott
has Cash and Points.

00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:12.350
My dad-- my parents are retired.

00:53:12.350 --> 00:53:14.225
I love-- my parents have
done so much for me.

00:53:14.225 --> 00:53:16.430
So I actually did a
Marriott Cash and Points

00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:18.200
where I got a week
at the JW Cannes,

00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:20.074
and I was there for the
Cannes Film Festival.

00:53:20.074 --> 00:53:22.320
It was, like, $2,000 a
night, but a beautiful room.

00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:24.500
And my dad has the
same name as me.

00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:27.640
So I transferred the miles
portion into his name,

00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:31.350
so he got 110,000 South--
or 120,000 Southwest

00:53:31.350 --> 00:53:32.947
and the Companion
Pass for two years.

00:53:32.947 --> 00:53:34.780
So him and my mom have
been maximizing that,

00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:35.780
and they had the points.

00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:37.704
So it was amazing.

00:53:37.704 --> 00:53:39.370
Once again, people
think Marriott points

00:53:39.370 --> 00:53:40.350
aren't worth that much.

00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:42.560
But when you can get
the Southwest Companion

00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:45.410
ticket and seven nights
at a JW for a total of,

00:53:45.410 --> 00:53:46.687
like, 300,000 or whatever--

00:53:46.687 --> 00:53:48.020
CLIFF REDEKER: Money well spent.

00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:48.570
BRIAN KELLY: I blogged about it.

00:53:48.570 --> 00:53:51.407
You can just Google the points
guy JW Cannes companion pass.

00:53:51.407 --> 00:53:52.240
CLIFF REDEKER: Cool.

00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:53.698
And then the last
question, what do

00:53:53.698 --> 00:53:55.780
you hope to accomplish
by this time next year?

00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:58.330
BRIAN KELLY: By
this time next year,

00:53:58.330 --> 00:54:02.240
I think that figuring out
the charity angle for me

00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:04.800
is amazing, and to do more.

00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:07.924
We're actually going to expand
PeaceJam in West Africa.

00:54:07.924 --> 00:54:09.340
If there's one
region of the world

00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:12.135
I think that needs some
focus on education--

00:54:12.135 --> 00:54:15.290
so I'm actually going with
Leymah Gbowee to Liberia

00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:18.230
to do more education there.

00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:20.990
So expanding that in
West Africa I think

00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:22.200
would be a big one for me.

00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:23.920
And just-- we're
growing the team.

00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:26.030
We're hiring a head
of social media.

00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:28.339
Just continuing and having
fun at what we're doing.

00:54:28.339 --> 00:54:29.380
CLIFF REDEKER: All right.

00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:31.150
Well, and of course, there
is the book coming out.

00:54:31.150 --> 00:54:32.600
So perhaps an Authors
at Google in the future.

00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:33.670
BRIAN KELLY: I wish
I could promote it,

00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:35.410
but it's still,
like, 18 months out.

00:54:35.410 --> 00:54:35.640
CLIFF REDEKER: All right.

00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:37.760
So I wanted to thank
you all for tuning in.

00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:39.900
You can visit Brian
at thepointsguy.com,

00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:43.670
@thepointsguy, Instagram,
Facebook, the whole deal.

00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:45.869
And we look forward to
seeing where you travel next.

00:54:45.869 --> 00:54:47.410
I believe you have
a flight to catch.

00:54:47.410 --> 00:54:48.720
BRIAN KELLY: I do have
a flight to catch.

00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:50.511
And I just want to say
thank you to Google.

00:54:50.511 --> 00:54:53.932
I mean, Google is the reason
why The Points Guy blew up

00:54:53.932 --> 00:54:54.890
in the way that it did.

00:54:54.890 --> 00:54:56.777
Organically, a friend
set me up, SEO.

00:54:56.777 --> 00:54:58.860
I never knew what that was
when I started blogging

00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:00.790
six years ago last month.

00:55:00.790 --> 00:55:03.870
But Google has really
changed my life.

00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:05.567
So it's a pleasure
for me to be here.

00:55:05.567 --> 00:55:07.150
And I do have a
flight to catch, but I

00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:07.860
have a little bit of time.

00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:09.540
So if you want to come
say hi if you're a reader,

00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:11.170
I would be happy
to meet you all.

00:55:11.170 --> 00:55:11.400
CLIFF REDEKER: All right.

00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:11.840
Cool.

00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:13.020
Well, thank you
very much, Brian.

00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:13.853
Thanks for speaking.

00:55:13.853 --> 00:55:14.570
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:14.570 --> 00:55:16.120
Awesome.
