00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.063
Hey it's me, Destin. Welcome
to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:03.088 --> 00:00:04.778
So I'm in the Netherlands today

00:00:04.803 --> 00:00:07.945
and I'm hanging out with a buddy of mine
that I met through a research project.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.129
His name is Johan Kr...

00:00:10.561 --> 00:00:12.258
- Reinink.
- That.

00:00:12.283 --> 00:00:14.689
So, anyway, Johan is a laser expert,

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:16.714
and I've worked with him
on stuff on the Internet.

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:18.399
So we're going to show you
how lasers work today.

00:00:18.424 --> 00:00:22.359
[Music]

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.238
(Destin) So this is an
open cavity laser, and

00:00:26.263 --> 00:00:28.452
can you explain the main components
of an open cavity laser?

00:00:28.477 --> 00:00:30.477
- Here we have the laser tube,

00:00:30.502 --> 00:00:32.791
with a helium-neon gas
that amplifies the light,

00:00:32.816 --> 00:00:37.277
and we have at both ends mirrors that are
aligned to bounce the light back and forth.

00:00:37.302 --> 00:00:39.678
- Should we fire it up?
- Definitely.

00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:41.657
[Click]

00:00:41.682 --> 00:00:43.867
(Johan) There's a 4 second delay.
It's a safety feature.

00:00:43.892 --> 00:00:46.640
- Alright. Sweet.

00:00:46.665 --> 00:00:50.618
(Johan) Well a helium-neon laser
tube is just a glorified neon light.

00:00:50.643 --> 00:00:53.250
It's just... you have the electrical
discharge going through it,

00:00:53.275 --> 00:00:54.846
like a neon sign,

00:00:54.871 --> 00:00:58.552
And the special thing is you
have here two aperatures,

00:00:58.577 --> 00:01:00.851
and the light can bounce straight through.

00:01:00.876 --> 00:01:05.270
So at both sides of the laser tube we've
placed two high reflecting mirrors,

00:01:05.295 --> 00:01:08.685
and the light that goes through
the laser tube hits the mirror

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.411
and bounces back in forth through the tube.

00:01:11.436 --> 00:01:14.049
And each time it passes the
tube it gets amplified.

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:18.149
You make this mirror slightly
transparent - it's 2% transparent -

00:01:18.174 --> 00:01:20.255
and each time the light passes,

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.353
2% moves out and you have,
like, a beam going on here.

00:01:24.974 --> 00:01:28.795
- Okay, so basically what comes
out the other end of the mirror

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.067
is the imperfection in the mirror.

00:01:31.092 --> 00:01:34.237
If it was a perfect mirror we wouldn't
get any output from the laser, correct?

00:01:34.262 --> 00:01:36.958
- Correct.
- But because the mirrors are imperfect

00:01:36.983 --> 00:01:39.638
we do get a little lasing.
- Yep.

00:01:39.663 --> 00:01:44.499
In this case, the laser is just
specifically made to reflect only 98%,

00:01:44.524 --> 00:01:48.266
and this is the 2% of the
light that comes out.

00:01:48.291 --> 00:01:51.147
(Destin) Alright, one thing I've
noticed is that inside the cavity

00:01:51.172 --> 00:01:52.694
the beam is much stronger.

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:56.003
You can see the laser hitting
particles in the air.

00:01:56.028 --> 00:02:00.341
But downstream the photons that
are leaking out of the mirror...

00:02:00.366 --> 00:02:02.892
It's not quite as strong. Is that correct?
- Yeah.

00:02:02.917 --> 00:02:07.501
The light circulating inside the
laser is far higher intensity.

00:02:07.526 --> 00:02:11.605
And if you hold your hand outside
of the laser and block the beam,

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.647
you see that you catch the beam.
It looks pretty nice.

00:02:14.672 --> 00:02:17.496
But if you hold your
hand inside the cavity,

00:02:17.521 --> 00:02:20.857
you'll block the laser from
amplifying all the light

00:02:20.882 --> 00:02:24.883
and the light won't circulate around,
and you don't have a laser anymore.

00:02:24.908 --> 00:02:27.373
(Destin) So it stops way on the other side.

00:02:27.398 --> 00:02:30.415
Even though we're stopping
it on this side of the tube,

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.632
we don't get lasing on the other side.

00:02:32.657 --> 00:02:36.604
I'm waiting on photon torpedo
technology myself, so...

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.313
- I'm working on it.
- You're working on it? Excellent.

00:02:39.338 --> 00:02:41.483
But anyway, we want to
thank Johan for his time,

00:02:41.508 --> 00:02:45.175
and uh... can you thank the
people who let us in, in Dutch?

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.449
- Absolutely.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.031
(Destin) What... did you
just call me something?

00:03:13.056 --> 00:03:18.322
- Nee... absolutely not.
[Both laugh]

00:03:18.347 --> 00:03:19.872
(Destin) Do you wanna get even smarter?

00:03:19.897 --> 00:03:22.082
Then check out this video by MinutePhysics.

00:03:22.107 --> 00:03:25.013
Henry explains what's going on
inside that helium-neon tube

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:27.454
in one of his cool science videos.

00:03:27.781 --> 00:03:30.513
[Music]

00:03:30.538 --> 00:03:32.767
(Destin) We're going to do Laser Month.

00:03:32.792 --> 00:03:37.087
Laser Month consists of a lot of videos
shot over here in Holland with Johan,

00:03:37.112 --> 00:03:39.925
Because he is a laser genius.
Can I call you a laser genius?

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.466
- Definitely.
[Destin laughs]

00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:45.193
Alright, so now we're going
to play laser limbo, ready?

00:03:45.218 --> 00:03:46.761
- No.
- Why not?

00:03:46.786 --> 00:03:49.388
- It's dangerous.
- Aw, c'mon, laser limbo.

00:03:49.413 --> 00:03:53.681
