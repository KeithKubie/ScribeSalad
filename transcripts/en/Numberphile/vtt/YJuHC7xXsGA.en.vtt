BRADY HARAN: Hey, everyone.

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:03.170
This is a video I've been
wanting to make since

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:04.920
Numberphile started, really.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.630
Because when you watch football,
or soccer if that's

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.240
what you want to call it, on
the TV I'm always amazed by

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.810
the number of statistics and
numbers they're able to throw

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:15.290
at you during the game.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:16.300
How do they do that?

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.560
Who's recording it?

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.800
So what I've done is spent a
couple of days at a company

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.820
called Opta who collects
statistics from various

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.740
sports, including soccer.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.110
Now in this film I want to give
you some idea just how

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.910
much information they collect
for every kick, every header,

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.950
every miss-kick, everything
that happens on the field

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.410
during a game of soccer.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.090
To do this, I've chosen just one
kick as an example, and I

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.650
thought, seeing we're choosing
one, we should

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:41.980
make a special one.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.430
So the one we're doing is a kick
by a guy called Andres

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.720
Iniesta in the 2010 World Cup
final, and it was the kick

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.960
that won the game.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.910
It was the scoring of the
winning goal in a one-nil

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.530
victory against Holland.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.080
Now unfortunately due to
copyright law, I can't show

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.420
you the goal, but it kind of
looked something like this.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.450
Just like being there,
wasn't it?

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.140
But to a statistics expert,
especially one from Opta, the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.040
goal looks more like this.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.160
So enough from me.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.680
Here's Sam talking you through
the anatomy, from a numbers

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.600
perspective, of the goal that
won the last World Cup final.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.550
SAM GREEN: For me, I
obviously see it as

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:24.600
well, and I enjoy it.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.730
But when we collect the data
I also see it as not just

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.880
numbers but a set of
data, basically.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.560
And this is the details
of every shot in

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.960
that World Cup final.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.810
So that was all the shots in the
game, and we're going to

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.830
look at, just in detail, about
Andres Initesta's, about the

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.270
winning goal-- well,
the only goal.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.900
The key stat, the key number
for us in this

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.620
case is number 16.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.585
It's completely random but for
us that's what a goal is.

00:01:48.585 --> 00:01:51.500
If it's an event 16, we
know it's a goal.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.260
BRADY HARAN: So for you,
16's a big deal.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.180
SAM GREEN: 16 is the magic
number in football.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.530
In Opta football, 16's
very important.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.940
BRADY HARAN: When you're walking
around the street, and

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.000
you see number 16 on a house,
do you think, "goal"?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.460
SAM GREEN: Do I think "goal"?

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.700
Yeah.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.220
And then you've got number one
is "pass" for me, so that's

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.419
the one I see all the time.

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:10.139
So, yeah.

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.770
You do come to think about, when
you're watching a game

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.970
you'll think about it in the
way the guys collect it and

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.420
the way it looks in
the database,

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.920
which is a mixed blessing.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.450
13 is a miss.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.400
So you get it off target.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.490
What else is there, off
the top of my head?

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.640
Three is a dribble.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.740
It's one of the more exciting
things that can happen.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.230
So we know it's a goal.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.120
It's number 16.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.030
We can see when it happens,
in the fourth period.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.590
So it's the second period of
extra time, the fourth overall

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.440
period of the game.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.930
When it happens, towards
the end.

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.100
We know this his ID, so I know
this is Andres Iniesta, 12237.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.040
And the team that took the
shot obviously was Spain.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.160
So outcome 1, in some things
that we collected, there's

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.180
obviously whether it
was a good thing or

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.020
completed or not.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.220
Obviously for a goal, we know
it was completed, so

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.360
it's outcome 1.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.360
The most crucial bit of
information, besides the fact

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.535
it was a goal, is where
it happened.

00:02:59.535 --> 00:03:01.650
So, these are our coordinates
for where it

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.000
happened on the pitch.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.050
I can kind of show you what
a 9, 62.3 looks like.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.170
BRADY HARAN: I see
your drawings--

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.330
SAM GREEN: Yeah, really
terrible.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.930
This is why I do
maths all day.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.660
It's already gone wrong.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:13.880
And the six-yard box.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.640
The goal is probably
about here.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.410
It's going to go about
here, about 9, goes

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.420
down to about there.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.780
62.3 tells me it's over here.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.070
This is 50, in the middle,
so I know 62.3 is

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.990
somewhere out here.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.480
There's an authentic recreation
of Iniesta.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.620
I'll do him with one little
strand of hair, because that's

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.470
about all he's got.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.580
So that tells us something
about it, but there's

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.050
obviously a lot more
that happened as to

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.020
why it was a goal.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.590
BRADY HARAN: What if
you caught up now?

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.000
SAM GREEN: So, here we've got
the sub-aspects of the shot.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.760
So with this extra data I can
see where it went in the goal,

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.340
the y and z coordinates.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.680
So these are the goals.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.830
So he stuck it about here.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.710
He stuck it the other
side of the goal.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.035
And it went not very high
off the ground.

00:03:56.035 --> 00:03:58.210
So he probably stuck it
around about here.

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.140
We have, before he took
the shot, there.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.532
We now know it went pretty much
in the bottom corner.

00:04:03.532 --> 00:04:05.930
Not quite tucked in,
but certainly to

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.070
the side of the keeper.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.900
I know it was assisted,
and that it was

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:10.730
an intentional assist.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.920
I know it went low to the
keeper's left, which makes

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.250
sense given that he shot it from
over here and we know it

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.320
ended up over here.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.296
Went with one bounce, he hit it
with his right foot, hit it

00:04:20.296 --> 00:04:23.330
on the volley, and it came
from a counter attack.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.140
And I also know the keeper
touched the ball.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.880
As memory serves it was
a small touch first,

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:30.380
Stekelenberg.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.330
So that's the anatomy
of the goal.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.790
That's all the information
we collect about it.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.800
There are different shots,
different goals that'll have

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.800
different bits of information.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.540
But that's what we know
about this shot.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.820
So we can then use that.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.210
We can put all that information
in and see how

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.720
likely was it that Iniesta would
have scored that goal,

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.100
the goal that ended up winning
the World Cup.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.620
BRADY HARAN: Now at this point
I guess a lot of you would

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.760
like to see a bit more about how
the numbers are collected,

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.390
how they harvest the statistics
during the game.

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.390
And I actually spent an entire
match day at Opta.

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.160
I was able to watch them during
the games, how they do

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.090
it, how they interact with
the commentators on TV.

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.270
That's going to be in
an upcoming video.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.400
But for now I thought I'd hear a
bit more from Sam about what

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.790
he does with the statistics
after the game, and maybe a

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.110
bit more about that Andreas
Iniesta goal.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.490
SAM GREEN: To take an example,
we go back to the Iniesta one,

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.450
the model that we developed
says, OK, that chance was

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.050
actually a really good chance
for it, as they go.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.670
It was about a 30% chance of
being a goal before we know

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.010
anything about where
he even put it.

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.910
Just to get the ball in that
good a position off a

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:39.110
counterattack is a very good
chance of scoring, 30%.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.350
It might not sound like that
much but a average shot's

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.850
probably around 8 to 10%.

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.330
So this is a really
good chance.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.290
But if we changed a few things,
if we took the shot

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:51.450
back to here--

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.510
it's the edge of the
18-yard box--

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.100
and the shot was here, it goes
from maybe 30% here down to

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.410
about, I don't know, 12% or so
it drops to about there.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.970
Equally, if we brought the shot
inside, so he's got the

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.130
full range of the goal to choose
from, goes from 30%,

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.830
but now it might go up to
about as high as 50%.

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.270
I've developed a model which
takes into account all these

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.350
kinds of factors about what
we know about the shots.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.430
Because we've got such a
huge backlog of shots

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.346
and details of them.

00:06:20.346 --> 00:06:21.202
BRADY HARAN: Can
you still enjoy

00:06:21.202 --> 00:06:22.910
watching a game of football?

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:23.980
SAM GREEN: Absolutely.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:24.640
More so.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.470
I think you look at things
in a different way.

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:31.050
You think about what players
are doing and where they're

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.280
doing it and how they're
doing it, and what

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.640
does that lead to.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.970
You still enjoy it and you still
watch the game, and it's

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:37.920
still exciting.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.430
And when there's a great goal or
a great save you still have

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.690
the same reflex reactions to
everything of excitement.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.860
But you just think about
the game in a

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:47.850
slightly different way.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:49.750
I think for me it's more fun.

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:50.200
I think it's better.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.850
But personal taste, I guess.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.740
I think the Holy Grail with
this kind of football

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.370
analytics and what I'm doing and
what lot of other people

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:03.790
are doing is something, you want
to get to one number that

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:07.180
broadly encapsulates that
player, and that player's

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:08.630
value, or at least
on pitch value.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.540
There could be other things--

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.440
age and contract which holds the
effect, their value to the

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.350
opposing team.

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:19.650
But purely on what they do,
value like baseball has Wins

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:20.490
Above Replacement.

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.690
And I think that's kind of where
I'm trying to take it.

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:25.536
I think probably other
people are trying

00:07:25.536 --> 00:07:26.330
to do the same thing.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:27.840
BRADY HARAN: This must be like
the best job in the world!

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:28.680
SAM GREEN: Yeah, pretty much.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.960
I mean, I didn't want to say
it in the interview, but if

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.680
they just gave me access to
the database I'd have been

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.490
pretty happy with that.

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:35.320
They didn't need to pay me.

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:40.550
But they seem to want to do
that, so that works for me.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:42.360
BRADY HARAN: So thanks to the
guys from Opta, and a

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.460
reminder, we'll have another
video soon where we go behind

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:49.000
the scenes on match day, which
is far more exciting.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.350
But for now, thank you for
watching, and some more of the

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.950
details about the statistics
can be found on the blog.
