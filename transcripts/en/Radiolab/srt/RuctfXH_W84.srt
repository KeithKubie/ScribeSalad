1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,500
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert
Krulwich. This is radio lab,

2
00:00:03,501 --> 00:00:08,090
and today we're talking about the interior
space that runs down from your much

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:12,230
to your butt, and it is
called your gut. You might,

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:17,320
what is that? It's just an an old
person's word for mouth. Anyhow,

5
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,150
as we just heard for a
very, very long time,

6
00:00:20,151 --> 00:00:24,360
people believed that the stomach was a
place of magical transformation. Yeah.

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,730
But of course, as we know now,

8
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,900
it's just a big muscle with
acid and enzymes and stuff,

9
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,900
but if you travel a little deeper down,

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,280
down below the stomach, yeah.

11
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:42,080
Then things get spooky
again. We just, you know, we,

12
00:00:42,081 --> 00:00:46,310
we have these sort of shadowy
images of what's going on in there.

13
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,210
That's Carl Zimmer, a shadowy figure
himself, a science writer. And can I,

14
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:53,290
can I get some water? Yeah. And the
frequently thirsty Matt, third guy,

15
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,760
little scratchy Soren. And
I called him up, you know,

16
00:00:55,761 --> 00:00:59,270
while you were gone on paternity leave.
Yup. And he told us you want to mystery.

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,290
Yeah, I do that. Okay. Then the
stomach is just a warmup. Oh yeah.

18
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,860
The 25 feet of coiled, soiled,

19
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:10,370
fitted tubing inside you. Give
me the intestines. Yeah. Yeah.

20
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,900
That's where the real
mystery lies, you know,

21
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:17,770
because here's the riddle is the part
of you that turns the world outside into

22
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:21,160
you, isn't just you.

23
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,480
It's more like a collective.
What does he mean by that? Well,

24
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,440
if you zoom into our
intestine [inaudible],

25
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,290
what you'll see is legions
of tiny creatures, bacteria,

26
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:36,200
viruses, fungi, protozoans,

27
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,810
and those are all little
single cell kind of guys.

28
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:43,070
We're talking about non human things
inside of me. How many of you,

29
00:01:43,071 --> 00:01:45,320
how many of you guys
would you say me? Yeah,

30
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:49,880
probably in the order of maybe
a couple thousand species.

31
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,590
So there's Nikolai Interior Odis for
jellies and then another one, another one.

32
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:58,870
It's a whole universe down there.
Yeah. Microbacteria travel bacteria.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,230
Your senior that follow
Caucus Chromo back the bureau.

34
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,040
Some of them you'll find in all of us
and then there are just a whole bunch of

35
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:12,080
other species that are rarer. Might
mean one person and not in the other.

36
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:16,190
It's like a rain forest. No. Yeah. There
are ecologists now studying your gut,

37
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,720
looking at these complicated networks
of hundreds of thousands of species that

38
00:02:20,721 --> 00:02:24,320
are living inside of you and depending
on each other or praying on each other.

39
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,800
It's just this incredibly [inaudible]
complicated pattern that scientists

40
00:02:27,801 --> 00:02:32,660
haven't figured out. When you're in
an embryonics in a, what is it called?

41
00:02:32,661 --> 00:02:35,720
The Sachs, your amniotic
sac, your amniotic sac.

42
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:40,500
How much bacteria do you have in
about your there? You're sterile.

43
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:44,560
You have none. No, at
all. You're clean, Huh?

44
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,360
But then as you are,

45
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,380
all of a sudden you're into this
new environment. The birth canal,

46
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,570
you're breathing, your mouth is open,

47
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:03,490
stuff is into your mouth. It's coating
your skin. There are lots of bacteria.

48
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:08,000
There is vagina in the birth canal. It's
a very complicated ecosystem there. And

49
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,560
right after you were born, Chez crawl,

50
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:16,561
you meet a nurse and some doctors
who go home to play in your backyard,

51
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:20,920
you'll suck on the shoe. They might
eat some dirt and get licked by a dog.

52
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,740
And by the time you're going to school,

53
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,320
you've got probably about a hundred
Chilean micro organisms that,

54
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:32,140
so 100 trillion other kinds
of cells in you. Yeah.

55
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:37,320
So if you were to take like all the
bacteria in your body and just made them

56
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:41,500
into one lump, it would
be about three pounds.

57
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,810
Oh really? Think of it as an organ. I
mean, your brain is about three pounds.

58
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:49,830
Your heart, you know, hearts a pound
or two. So this is another organ.

59
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,620
In this case, it's an organ that helps
you digest food. But here's the thing,

60
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,310
this place in you which is
filled with foreign critters,

61
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,760
somehow this organ gets into your head.

62
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,540
What does that even mean?
Wait, you just wait a second.

63
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:06,380
Let me introduce you to someone. Ah,
hello. Can you hear me? Yes. Yep,

64
00:04:06,381 --> 00:04:08,910
we can hear you, John. My
name is professor John Crying.

65
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:13,380
I'm a the professor and chair of Anatomy
and neuroscience here at University

66
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,500
College Cork in Ireland. And I'm a
neuroscientist. A brain guy. Yup.

67
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,830
If someone told me six years ago I
was in neuroscientist that I'd be here

68
00:04:19,831 --> 00:04:22,710
talking about microbes. I
would have laughed it off.

69
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,360
But to make a long story short,

70
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,670
John found that he was
getting into neuroscience.

71
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,150
A lot of the neuroscientists at
his university in Cork in Ireland.

72
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:34,020
They were getting into bugs for reasons
that will become apparent in a moment.

73
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:39,380
And eventually he got the bug for
books and began to work with this one

74
00:04:39,601 --> 00:04:43,890
particular strain of bacteria. The
lactobacillus strain. What was it?

75
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,460
Lactose something. Lactobacillus.
Lactobacillus rhamnosus.

76
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,990
It's looks like a pill really is kind of
oblong thing and it's sometimes used to

77
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:55,410
make yogurt. We were
interested in whether I, uh,

78
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:00,120
if you fed mice with this for
a number of weeks, whether the,

79
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:04,230
it would alter their behavioral
state, meaning if you fed these mice,

80
00:05:04,231 --> 00:05:07,920
a bunch of this bacteria, would they
become very different mice? Yeah,

81
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,520
different mice. You mean like different
my fat or mice or something? No, no, no,

82
00:05:11,521 --> 00:05:13,470
no, no. Would they change
their personalities?

83
00:05:13,471 --> 00:05:17,850
This is like a profound change because
of a, a bacteria in their stomach. Yeah.

84
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,880
Not In their brain. No. Just in
their tummies. Just in their tummy.

85
00:05:20,881 --> 00:05:23,360
That's insane. That's not going to
work. But let me tell you what he did.

86
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:28,280
All right. He had two groups of mice.
One of them got the Lactobacillus,

87
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,980
the others, they got
just normal mouse food.

88
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,270
We fed them a broth just as a control,
so it didn't have any bacteria.

89
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,600
Then we looked at how they
responded to a mild water stress.

90
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:45,530
And what we found was
that I [inaudible] sorry.

91
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,070
Well it's water. It's water
at room temperature. It's,

92
00:05:49,071 --> 00:05:52,610
it's basically what he did is he took
these two groups of mice, the bacteria,

93
00:05:52,611 --> 00:05:54,520
mice and the no bacteria mice.

94
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,680
And then he would drop
them into a of water.

95
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:03,020
And all roads are very good swimmers,
but they just don't like water. Oh.

96
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,040
And what he was looking for was any
difference between the two groups in terms

97
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,930
of how they dealt with
this water situation.

98
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,890
Like if one group squeaks more
than the other or something. No,

99
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,200
you just keep an open mind and you wait
and see what's going to happen. Fine.

100
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:20,180
So air you go. Starting with the
first group, the normal ones,

101
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:23,450
he drops them in and as you'd
expect, they try and escape.

102
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:27,350
They try and escape anytime them to
see how long they keep at it. Okay.

103
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,350
And one minute passes. They swim,

104
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,610
they swim to the edge and all around
looking for an escape. Two minutes past

105
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,620
three minutes path, but
about four minutes in,

106
00:06:39,621 --> 00:06:42,230
he says the mice start to get worn down

107
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:47,060
and then they decide. At this point
there's no point I'm giving up.

108
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:49,800
[inaudible]

109
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,760
which means what? They, the,

110
00:06:50,761 --> 00:06:54,320
the ordinary might just go and do a dead
mouse float. Yeah. A dead mouse flows.

111
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:58,370
You know, they just gave up. They don't
drown. No, no, no. They sit there,

112
00:06:58,371 --> 00:07:01,520
sit there and think, oh, I will waiting
this out until it's over. Exactly.

113
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,710
It's been coined behavioral despair.

114
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,920
That is how a normal mouse reacts
to being tossed into water.

115
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:11,540
It struggles for about four minutes.

116
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:14,990
It gives up and then sinks into
despair for the second group.

117
00:07:14,991 --> 00:07:17,680
And this is the group that
ate the bacteria. Yeah.

118
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,990
Dudes also drop them in the water.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Here we go.

119
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,770
At first he says they were
just like the first group.

120
00:07:24,771 --> 00:07:27,980
They were swimming around
frantically for one minute,

121
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,080
two minutes, three minutes,

122
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:39,560
but then at the four minute mark when the
first group of mice had given up these

123
00:07:39,561 --> 00:07:42,170
mice, they kept going.

124
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,250
They kept looking for an hour
past four minutes to five minutes,

125
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:51,470
six minutes. So they're
not despairing. Exactly.

126
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,030
And they might've kept
going on and on and on,

127
00:07:53,031 --> 00:07:55,940
but he then plucked them out
of the water after six minutes.

128
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,280
The thing is kind of
strange. It's like, you know,

129
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:03,350
worrying and scurrying about and panicking
like that all seems like what it is

130
00:08:03,351 --> 00:08:07,520
to be a mouse. And you're saying that
a bacteria in the gut can change that?

131
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,400
Yeah. Wait a second, Soren. Okay, fine.

132
00:08:10,401 --> 00:08:13,490
There seems to be a difference between
these two groups, but how do you know?

133
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,420
How does John know that the bacteria
had anything to do with it? Well,

134
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,850
you didn't just stare at the
mice. He looked at their,

135
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:24,620
at their mouse chemistry by looking at
the stress hormones and we measured them.

136
00:08:24,621 --> 00:08:26,970
What he found is that in
the first group though,

137
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,550
the mice that quit and despaired,

138
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:32,390
we got about a hundred fold
increase in a corticosterone levels.

139
00:08:32,391 --> 00:08:37,010
That's the hormonal version of
exactly. And in that first group,

140
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,120
when he dropped them in the water,
their blood flooded with this one,

141
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,040
which initially, you know, it's not a
bad thing because a mouse has to act,

142
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:49,130
but all out panic isn't
great for a little mouse.

143
00:08:49,131 --> 00:08:52,100
And after a couple of minutes of
hormone coursing through the veins,

144
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,740
the mouse just burns out and down.

145
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,990
But in the second group of mice, now
these are the mice that eat the bacteria.

146
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:06,280
We found that in the mice fed the
lactobacillus, they, well, first of all,

147
00:09:06,281 --> 00:09:11,281
they had half as much of
that stress hormone half and
they had another chemical.

148
00:09:11,471 --> 00:09:13,630
Suddenly in the mix, we found very,

149
00:09:13,631 --> 00:09:18,631
very distinct changes in the receptors
for Gaba in a variety of brain regions.

150
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,480
Gabba Gabba Gabba well, he says,

151
00:09:22,481 --> 00:09:25,240
you can think of it as the
opposite of a stress hormone.

152
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:29,670
It basically is there to shut down
the brain, stop things inhibit, uh,

153
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,690
make us more relaxed, chilled out.

154
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:35,440
And he thinks what's happening is that
in these mice that ate the bacteria,

155
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:39,250
they hit the water. The
stress hormones come online.

156
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:44,440
But before things get too intense
incomes, Gabba Gabba just goes,

157
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,620
hey

158
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:57,550
[inaudible].

159
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,730
And as a result, these mice, they're
chilled out, they're relaxed,

160
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,450
they're not afraid. They never
panic. They never burn out.

161
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,350
And they never fall into despair. They
behaved as if they were on Ballium.

162
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,280
So somehow the mice,

163
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:18,250
the gut bacteria of the bias
are sending volume to the brain.

164
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,250
Is that what he's saying? That's what
he's saying. Yeah. But you haven't,

165
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,750
he hasn't said anything about bacteria
yet. It's a long distance. Well,

166
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,260
let me get your brain up here.

167
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:29,480
John told me that if you
look inside a mouse's body,

168
00:10:29,481 --> 00:10:31,190
you will find a giant nerve.

169
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:35,660
The vagus nerve that runs between
the Gus and the brain. Oh,

170
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,150
you mean like a phone line?
Exactly. And he thought, well,

171
00:10:38,151 --> 00:10:40,640
maybe they chemically
tickle one end of the line,

172
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,350
send a signal up to the brain,
which then makes the Gaba.

173
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,660
Now in order to prove
this, he thought his mind,

174
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:52,400
I just cut the line basically
sever the Vegas nerve. Oh,

175
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,250
because then if the bacteria
are the ones doing it,

176
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:59,400
if he cuts the phone line they won't be
able to do it anymore and then the mind

177
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,340
should go back to normal. Exactly.

178
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:05,660
So in collaboration with my
colleagues at McMaster in Ontario,

179
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:08,960
he got some mice, we fed
them the bacteria again,

180
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,390
but this time before
throwing them into the pool,

181
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:16,660
he cut the nerve and we found that
all of the changes that we had seen,

182
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,650
the swimming forever,

183
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:23,210
that not giving up and the neuro
chemical changes in the brain, the Gaba,

184
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:28,100
she making them so calm.
We're completely absent. Ah,

185
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,010
you cut out the highway and
then the did the communication,

186
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:36,170
the grainy changes stop. Totally.
Totally. Huh. When nick got the nerve,

187
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,530
the mice went back to being quitters. Yep.

188
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:46,020
You have to be convinced
that. Okay, I'm convinced.

189
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,190
So here's my question though. This
is a mouse we're talking about.

190
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,940
This is just a mouse. Does this have
anything to say about us? I mean,

191
00:11:52,941 --> 00:11:54,100
is there any connection to make?

192
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:58,720
Well, I asked Carl that question
there. There was one study, uh, that,

193
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:03,760
where was it? Uh, Oh, you know what? Oh,

194
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,960
so this was a clinical trial
actually done in France last year.

195
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:08,890
That's Jonah Lira,

196
00:12:08,891 --> 00:12:12,130
who regularly reports about things in
neurological for us and, and others.

197
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,330
And he knew about the study too. Yes.

198
00:12:14,331 --> 00:12:19,150
So they fed people just massive doses of
probiotics and probiotic mean like the

199
00:12:19,151 --> 00:12:23,170
good ones versus the bad ones. Yeah.
Probiotics or the good gut bacteria.

200
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:26,140
They're in yogurt and things like
that. So these guys from France,

201
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,630
they gave these people packets,

202
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:32,200
like sugar sized packets of
powder inside the package.

203
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:36,160
There are two different kinds of bugs
and October facilities, Helvetica,

204
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:39,820
bifidobacterium, Longum,
two of my favorite. Yeah.

205
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,150
Well you should like them because I gave
them to people and they showed a fairly

206
00:12:43,151 --> 00:12:47,260
dramatic reduction in their baseline
anxiety levels that became less stressful

207
00:12:47,261 --> 00:12:51,010
and had less anxiety because when they
took them to high diving boards and threw

208
00:12:51,011 --> 00:12:54,400
them off and fill the screen. And how
did they, how do you test these things?

209
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,370
Um, I say the Hopkins Symptom checklist,

210
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:00,460
basically they did a little
survey and asked questions. Uh,

211
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,530
how distressed do you feel? You know,

212
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:06,790
they took levels of stress hormones
on a 24 hour urinary free cortisol,

213
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:06,931
you know,

214
00:13:06,931 --> 00:13:10,950
so they had some quantitative measures
and people who took those probiotics had,

215
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:15,280
they felt less angry, less
anxious, and less depressed.

216
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:19,930
So the gut bugs have us on a chain
to, yeah, cause we, you know, we have,

217
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,990
you know, one thing to remember
is like, you know, our mood,

218
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:26,350
a lot of the way our mood
is set is through Serotonin.

219
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,540
That's like when they
do antidepressant drugs,

220
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:32,590
it's the serotonin uptake something. So
you're controlling them out. Serotonin,

221
00:13:32,591 --> 00:13:34,890
that's going in and out
of your neurons, right?

222
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:37,960
You have very little serotonin in your
brain, but it makes a huge difference.

223
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:41,740
You have a huge supply
of Serotonin in your gut.

224
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:45,700
80% of all the Serotonin in your
body is in your gut. Really? Yeah.

225
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:49,420
And that bacteria can be feeding on
that stuff. And you know there could be,

226
00:13:49,421 --> 00:13:50,830
it could be that you know they,

227
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,250
you have an oil well of happiness in
your gut and if you get the right pump,

228
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:58,090
you could feel happy more of the
Times. One possibility. So Jared,

229
00:13:58,091 --> 00:14:01,330
when you and I are sitting around
feeling all stressed and anxious,

230
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,680
or if we're just happy and, and
gay in the old sense of word,

231
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,290
now we know that this mood
is shadowed, influenced,

232
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:12,190
and shaped by the bacteria
you have in your intestine.

233
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:18,470
The kinds of studies
that show this effect,

234
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,250
they've all happened in the past
couple of years and that's it, period.

235
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,110
But there's this judge review.

236
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,300
It was in the proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences.

237
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,290
It was just kind of commenting on a
couple of these studies and saying like,

238
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,070
hmm,

239
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:35,930
let's think about which bacteria we
should focus on for psychological

240
00:14:35,931 --> 00:14:36,764
treatments.

241
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:40,100
Let's think about how we can treat
people's psychological disorders with

242
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,320
bacteria this way. Let's
just think about it.

243
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,170
This isn't the proceedings of the
National Academy of the sciences.

244
00:14:45,171 --> 00:14:50,171
They're talking about treating
psychological disorders with yogurt.

245
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:54,890
Yeah, medicinal yogurt in the
future. Medicinal as in Prozac.

246
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:00,290
Sure. Medicinal as in whatever they'd
give to people with schizophrenia.

247
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:02,300
Well I don't, I mean who knows.

248
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:05,210
I mean who knows what will work
and what won't work. It's just,

249
00:15:05,211 --> 00:15:08,090
but it's something that people are
saying like we need to look into this.

250
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,280
There's something for me,

251
00:15:10,281 --> 00:15:14,660
a little poetic about the fact that a
lot of our moods come from the same organ

252
00:15:14,661 --> 00:15:19,430
that produces, I mean, I haven't put my
finger on what's poetic about that, but,

253
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:23,770
but it just does kind of, I mean it,

254
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,870
it does make a little bit more sense
when you step back and think about this

255
00:15:26,871 --> 00:15:28,760
from the spectrum of
evolution that you know,

256
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,640
our biggest decisions way
back when, where, what to eat,

257
00:15:31,641 --> 00:15:34,340
is this gonna kill me and make
me sick? Is this food spoiled?

258
00:15:34,341 --> 00:15:38,180
So it makes sense that the part of
the body which can detect that is also

259
00:15:38,181 --> 00:15:40,310
intimately connected with decision making.

260
00:15:40,311 --> 00:15:42,770
Systems that have to do with this
gonna make me happy or this is,

261
00:15:42,771 --> 00:15:44,270
I should fear this and not eat this.

262
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:47,840
So as I landish as it seems that you know,

263
00:15:47,841 --> 00:15:50,300
the self is connected with
the part of the body that it,

264
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,660
it also has a little bit
of engineering logic to it.

265
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,793
Uh Huh

266
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:15,160
[inaudible] [inaudible]

267
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,820
special thanks to Carl Zimmer. His
latest book is called science ink.

268
00:16:18,821 --> 00:16:23,590
It's a description of tattoos that people
get on scientific themes and you can

269
00:16:23,591 --> 00:16:28,060
see them on their arms, their legs,
thighs, and embarrassing places. Yes,

270
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,330
thanks. Also to Jonah Lehrer,
whose new book is called,

271
00:16:31,331 --> 00:16:35,560
imagine how creativity works and you
can see their creativity on their nose,

272
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,160
eyes, cheeks, and embarrassing places.
Speaking of embarrassing places,

273
00:16:39,161 --> 00:16:41,230
we're going to go to one right
now. We'll be right back.

274
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,080
Okay.

275
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,680
Special thanks to Carl Zimmer. His
latest book is called science ink.

276
00:16:45,681 --> 00:16:48,580
It's a description of
tattoos that people get, uh,

277
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,700
on the scientific themes and you can see
them on their arms, their legs, thighs,

278
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:55,610
and embarrassing places. Yes. And thanks.
