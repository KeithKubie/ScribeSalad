JOHN DURANT: Today I
wanted to talk about paleo

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.950
as bio-hacking, which may be a
little bit different than how

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.880
it's currently
portrayed in the press.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.490
A lot of the pieces on the paleo
diet, or the cave man diet,

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.050
in the press are a
little bit cartoonish.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.060
I'm a little bit
responsible for that.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.260
But it often gets portrayed as
the macho man eating raw meats

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.900
straight off the
bone wearing a loin

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.110
cloth, which is pretty silly.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.380
But that's sort of the way
that a lot of journalists

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.100
portray it.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.840
My book, and this approach,
is actually about something

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.530
much bigger than paleo or
the paleolithic or even just

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.430
diet, which is starting to take
evolution, human evolution,

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.390
seriously when we think
about human health.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.060
The current state of
health recommendations

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.450
in this country and
the world is awful.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.370
So many people
want to be healthy,

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.202
but are confused by
conflicting advice.

00:01:03.202 --> 00:01:04.410
You know, should I do Atkins?

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.280
Should I go vegetarian?

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.120
Health issues, ethical
issues, environmental issues.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.250
For weight loss or
autoimmune conditions?

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.310
Should I count calories?

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.180
Is fat evil?

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.540
Are there types of
fat that aren't evil?

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.300
There's a lot of mass
confusion out there.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.210
And there are a lot of eating
disorders, clearly obesity,

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.560
type 2 diabetes.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.220
People are living a long
time, but the question is,

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.580
are they thriving
and being healthy?

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.000
So the broader concept that
I want to talk about today

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.060
isn't just diet or isn't
just the paleolithic,

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.011
but starting to use
our evolutionary past

00:01:43.011 --> 00:01:46.760
to generate really smart
heuristics that are probably

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.430
pretty close to being right
in pretty short order.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.870
I'm sure you guys are very
familiar with some principles

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.560
of hacking or bio-hacking.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.710
And I just sort of want to do
a comparison between principals

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.530
of hacking or bio-hacking,
and what this broader paleo

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.230
sphere is doing in
the health world.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.350
So trial-and-error
is very important--

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.650
hands-on, do-it-yourself,
self-experimentation, n equals

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.530
1, experiments.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.060
And speed-- move fast.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.870
Embrace failure-- break things.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.540
80% solutions--
don't let the perfect

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.530
be the enemy of the good.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.190
Resourcefulness--
repurposing old features

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.414
for new uses,
accidental discoveries.

00:02:42.414 --> 00:02:43.830
I'm moving very
quickly over these

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.704
because I feel like this
audience is probably

00:02:45.704 --> 00:02:48.360
very familiar with
this type of stuff.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.570
Simplicity-- keep
it simple stupid.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:51.930
Decentralization.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.440
All these hacking principles.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.440
What's also cool
about these principles

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.460
is it's actually have evolution
by natural selection works.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.880
It's an amateurish
process without

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.360
any overarching authority.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.810
It isn't concerned with theory.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.570
Organisms are always
using whatever

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:18.430
a bits are lying around as
material for new functions

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.170
and features.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.800
It's sort of a blind,
trial-and-error search process.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.480
So when you actually look at
this broader paleo movement,

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.980
whether you call it that word.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.420
Maybe another word is
better-- ancestral health,

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.090
evolutionary health,
evolutionary medicine.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.580
Again, you have a lot
of similar features.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.230
You basically have a lot
of amateurs out there

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.520
who have said a lot
of the top-down advice

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.570
that we're getting from
health officials at the USDA

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.980
or in the government or my
corporate health program

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.090
or my health insurance policy
don't seem to be working.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.780
And so maybe it's time to
start treating your own health

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.095
as a do-it-yourself activity.

00:04:09.095 --> 00:04:11.470
Because if you want to prevent
chronic health conditions,

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.230
there's no magic
pill you can take.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.590
There's no surgery
that you can conduct

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.709
to prevent the onset of
obesity and type 2 diabetes

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.390
and Alzheimer's and
things like that.

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.700
You actually have to take
day-to-day in your daily life

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.380
to prevent all these things.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.280
So in a sense, we're
all bio-hackers

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.650
if we want to be healthy.

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.290
We have to do it yourself.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.400
Over the last few years,
this sort of paleo approach

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.740
has been pounding the pavement
on things like saturated fat.

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.670
And that a lot of the
science on saturated fat

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:53.680
has been distorted,
or poorly conducted,

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.810
publishing biases to make
saturated fat look bad.

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.970
But over the last couple
years of iteration of people

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.490
experimenting with
their own blood work,

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.380
with different levels of
saturated fat in their diet,

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.840
people have very
quickly realized,

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.770
wait a second, saturated
fat is not this evil thing.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.050
40% of all fats in human
breast milk or saturated.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.460
About 40% of all the fats in
the human body are saturated.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.400
We've had saturated fat in
our diet for millions of years

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.160
from bone marrow and brains.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.680
So our metabolism is
well-adapted to metabolizing,

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.440
to harnessing it as
an energy source.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.000
So you see issues
like that where

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.410
this bottom-up, open source
community is moving much faster

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.430
than the conventional
health authorities.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.170
Embracing failure.

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:51.340
There are folks in
the paleosphere who

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.640
get into fights about
whether eating a legume

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.730
is going to kill you or not,
or give you kidney stones.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.210
Or rice or wheat.

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.160
A lot of people are
talking about gluten-free.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:10.270
Is having a little bit of gluten
going to cause stomach problems

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.090
and digestive
problems in any one?

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.210
Is this overblown?

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.500
So there may be some areas
where this burgeoning

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.680
movement is wrong.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.987
That's OK.

00:06:18.987 --> 00:06:19.945
People are moving fast.

00:06:19.945 --> 00:06:20.960
They're experimenting.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.920
And they're going to see
whether it works or not.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.003
We don't have to go through
all the rest of these.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.850
So much my book actually isn't
mostly about the paleolithic,

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:32.350
even though it uses
the word paleo.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.370
And so I want to
introduce the structure

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:41.150
that I use to think about human
evolution and any health issue

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.650
that you want to deal with--
not just food, not just

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:44.800
movement or anything.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:51.020
So this is a typical
singularity chart from Kurzweil

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:56.360
from life to today, the
growth of complexity

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.950
or major transitions
over that period of time.

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:03.900
And so I sort of
structure my thinking

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.390
into five main
buckets, as we think

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:10.030
about human evolution from the
beginning of life to today.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.440
What I call the Animal
Age, or basically

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:17.620
from the Cambrian explosion to
the beginning the Paleolithic,

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.240
pre-human essentially.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:25.040
We can learn a lot from other
species and our common ancestry

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.000
with other species about how to
be healthy, whether it's food,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.875
whether its movement.

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.590
Then you get the Paleolithic
for about 2.6 million years.

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:42.170
That's when you get hominids
and humans emerging.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.730
Then you get the
Agricultural Age.

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:46.230
After the agricultural
revolution,

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:48.600
we domesticate
plants and animals,

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.330
start living in cities.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.800
Our lifestyles
change dramatically.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.230
The industrial age.

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:55.710
And the information age.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:08:03.830
And we can use this simple
five-age, five-era framework

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:09.477
to in really quick fashion get
a handle, 80% of the way there

00:08:09.477 --> 00:08:10.810
on pretty much any health issue.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:17.030
And start to cut through
a lot of noise that's

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:20.100
out there about
how to be healthy.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.680
Should we eat saturated fat?

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.201
How much sun exposure
should we get?

00:08:24.201 --> 00:08:25.200
How much should we move?

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.550
And in what ways are the
best ways to exercise?

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:31.410
And all of these questions
that just fill the bookstores

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:34.590
with diet books and health
books and all this nuttiness.

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:36.480
It doesn't have to
be this complicated.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:40.220
So some of the
heuristics that we

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.960
can learn when we
look at other species

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:46.070
is any health dynamic you care
about-- thermal regulation,

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:51.790
diet, movement,
anything-- the best way

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:54.510
to learn about it is to
completely forget human beings

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:55.900
and just look at other species.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.640
And compare that dynamic
across different species.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.060
Because as soon as you
start talking about humans,

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:07.550
everybody has preconceived
notions about how to do it.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:09.620
People have a lot of--
particularly in food,

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:13.290
food is like religion-- people
have all these identity--

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.450
it's a source of identity
for a lot of people.

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:18.033
And so you can't have an honest
conversation about what should

00:09:18.033 --> 00:09:21.110
I eat or what should I not eat?

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:26.450
So if you look at our common
ancestry with other species,

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:30.200
you can be like, OK, well
there are herbivores.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.680
There are carnivores.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:32.930
There are omnivores.

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:35.430
And if you go to a
zoo, the basic approach

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:37.550
that the top zoos
in the world take,

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:40.710
is they use modern science
and medical technology

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.200
to keep the animals alive.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.620
But then they mimic the
natural habitat and lifestyle

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:49.620
of the species in relevant
ways, in the most relevant ways.

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.930
And so it just depends
on the species.

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:55.500
You want to feed red
meat and whole prey

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.050
feeding to the lions
and the carnivores.

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:01.200
And you want to feed
grass to the herbivores,

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.940
or whatever plant species
they're adapted to.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:08.160
And omnivores have more
dietary flexibility.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:14.270
Immediately you can start to
realize that, first of all,

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:16.910
there's no particular food
out there that is necessarily

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:19.870
inherently unhealthy.

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:25.160
It depends on whether that
species is adapted to it.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.470
Plenty of species are
adapted to eating grass.

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:33.080
And they have the microorganisms
in their extensive stomach

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.280
to digest it all.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.430
We don't.

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:43.590
A second thing that you can
learn very quickly about health

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:46.490
from looking at other
species-- and again looking

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:49.580
at zoos, because that's
where we often have the best

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:53.020
access to them-- is the
importance of habitat.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.150
And starting to
think about health

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:57.880
in terms of a
holistic habitat-based

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.990
approach to keeping
species healthy.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.910
I talk about, in my book,
a trip to the Cleveland zoo

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:10.075
where they had some
obese gorillas.

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:16.040
Heart disease and heart failure
is the number one killer

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:19.950
of male gorillas in captivity,
just like heart disease

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:25.020
is the number one killer of
male humans in civilization.

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:26.760
And so they were
trying to figure out

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:31.070
ways to reverse or halt the
progression of heart disease

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:33.580
in these Western
lowland gorillas.

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:35.990
And it's kind of like,
OK, so what should we do?

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:38.470
They don't really have
any fat in their diet,

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:41.230
so low-fat doesn't work.

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:43.760
I guess what they could try
to restrict their calories,

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.940
but that didn't
seem to make sense.

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.450
So what they did was they
were like, oh wait a second,

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:52.520
maybe we shouldn't be feeding
these Western lowland gorillas

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:56.610
wheat, corn, and soy-based
fiber bars that are essentially

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:58.860
reformulated dog food.

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.260
Of course it's
not even dog food,

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.480
because that's not what
dogs and wolves eat.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.190
So they switched the gorillas
to a bunch of leafy plants

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:14.160
and vegetables that they bought
in the local Cleveland grocery

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.110
store.

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:16.920
McCullough lost 70 pounds.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.280
Beback lost 35 pounds.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.560
Their blood work improved.

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.160
Behavioral problems went away.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.070
All sorts of things like that.

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:30.676
But all of these zoos
realized that you

00:12:30.676 --> 00:12:32.050
can use modern
medical technology

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:35.300
to keep the animals alive
for a long period of time,

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:38.260
but if you want to prevent
the onset of chronic health

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.340
conditions to help
them thrive, you

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.000
have to take a
habitat-based approach.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.020
Because there's no
pill, there's no surgery

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:48.350
that can be done to
reverse these conditions,

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:50.910
or at least not
terribly effectively.

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:54.230
So that gives you your
first-pass approach at, OK,

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:55.890
how does this dynamic work?

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:57.510
Forget human beings.

00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:00.270
Then the next step
is to say, OK well,

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:04.470
if we're talking
about diet, now how

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:08.340
does this feature
manifest in human beings

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:12.980
during a long formative
period in human evolution?

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:16.790
During the paleolithic, this
2.6 million year period.

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:19.310
It's not the end of the story.

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:22.830
But it really is sort of
the beginning of the story.

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:27.370
I don't think that paleo diets,
and paleo this and paleo that

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:29.490
is the end of the conversation.

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:32.040
It's more like it's the
appropriate beginning

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.120
of the conversation.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:40.110
So if you were talking about
diet, that's where you realize,

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:41.980
you talk to paleo
anthropologists

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:44.130
and realize that
humans have been eating

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:47.050
meat for 2.6 million
years or longer.

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:49.360
There are cut marks
on bones that we

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.720
have going back that long.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:55.970
And so right off the bat,
you're just immediately

00:13:55.970 --> 00:14:00.010
skeptical of claims that
veganism or vegetarianism are

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:02.730
the optimal ways for humans
to be healthy because it's

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:04.690
like, wait a second,
we've been omnivores

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:06.810
for millions of years.

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:10.510
There are no known vegan
or vegetarian indigenous

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:13.050
populations.

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:16.810
And the introduction of
meat into the human diet

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:22.150
is, does appear, to
be related, in part,

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:25.490
to the expansion of our brains.

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:29.000
And so the paleolithic gives you
this first-pass approximation

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.190
of what might be a healthy
lifestyle, healthy diet,

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:39.571
temperature changes, circadian
rhythms, sleep patterns, all

00:14:39.571 --> 00:14:40.070
of this.

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:42.410
It gives you a
first-pass approximation

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:46.560
of what might be a healthy
pattern for human beings today.

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.840
It doesn't guarantee
that there aren't

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.730
new ways of doing
things that are better,

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:53.740
new foods that might
be healthier or better.

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:57.820
But for the amateur
trying to quickly arrive

00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:01.920
at good heuristics, it's
the right place to start.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:04.140
Then after the
agricultural revolution,

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:05.770
people start living in cities.

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:08.420
We become farmers
and herders instead

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:11.070
of hunters and gatherers.

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:15.070
And so, then you take into
account recent adaptations.

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:18.500
So just because a
food is novel doesn't

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:22.130
mean it's bad or unhealthy.

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:27.250
So, for example, most
people's favorite foods

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:32.560
come from fermentation, whether
it's alcohol or cheese or bread

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:37.140
or a lot of things the
harness microorganisms

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:39.590
and the process of
fermentation to be created.

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:43.040
So we can take into account
recent cultural adaptations.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:47.350
We can also take into
account genetic adaptations.

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:49.970
You look at alcohol,
and populations

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:53.710
that have been drinking
alcohol for 5,000 years

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:56.450
handle it better than
indigenous populations that

00:15:56.450 --> 00:16:01.050
have been drinking alcohol
for three generations.

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:07.040
They're just not adapted to
metabolizing alcohol well.

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:13.060
If you come from European
or Middle Eastern ancestry,

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:16.040
our ancestors went
through a process

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:19.840
where there were probably lots
of people dying of alcoholism.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:23.800
But it happened 5,000 years ago.

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.980
And I won't go too
much into this,

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.210
but one of the heuristics
that's very important

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:31.930
is realizing the
importance of culture,

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:34.870
both culture in the forms
of ideas and microbes

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:37.190
to human health.

00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:39.040
So then you get
the Industrial Age.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:42.230
And the Industrial Age and
the Industrial Revolution

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:43.680
over the last
couple hundred years

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.790
is pretty much a warning
of what not to do.

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:48.035
This is the simple heuristic.

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:55.110
The British Navy sends a
bunch of sailors out on ships.

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:58.490
And they alter their food
so that it doesn't perish,

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:01.620
and don't realize that these
guys are going to get scurvy

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:05.839
because there's no Vitamin
C in what they're eating.

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:09.740
Or people move indoors and
they don't get any sunlight.

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:11.890
And then people get rickets.

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:16.270
So we started changing
things in human lives

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:18.819
so quickly during the
Industrial Revolution

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:23.349
that we weren't able to adapt
culturally or genetically.

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:30.400
Rickets, pellagra,
scurvy, even explorers

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.650
going in novel habitats
during the Industrial

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:38.230
Age, a flight going undersea.

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:40.040
This industrial
technology was literally

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:42.620
pushing human beings in
habitats that we had never

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:49.460
experienced over eons of
genetic and cultural evolution.

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:52.850
And we learned how
to kill ourselves.

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:55.510
We killed ourselves at the
beginning of the Industrial

00:17:55.510 --> 00:18:00.300
Revolution through lack of
sun exposure and rickets,

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:04.280
through missing micronutrients,
changing our diet so quickly

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:07.550
and shifting to a diet of
refined flour and sugar

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:10.270
and alcohol that we were
missing key micronutrients

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:11.210
from our diet.

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:13.570
And then by the end
of the Industrial Age,

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:17.310
we figure out that we need
to add certain things back in

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:18.830
and fortified foods with them.

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:21.530
But we were just solving
problems of our own creation.

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:23.290
So the big lesson from
the Industrial Age

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:25.050
is learning how to
not die basically.

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:31.340
And then today in
the Information Age

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:35.810
we're now in a position
to-- the last piece of this

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:39.080
is personal experimentation and
customizing solutions to you.

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:47.480
Because everybody has a unique
genome, unique gut bacteria,

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:51.360
allergies, injuries, tastes,
preferences, budgets,

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.020
so we're all unique organisms.

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:54.740
We all live in a unique habitat.

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.340
We're all going to end up
with somewhat unique diets

00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:59.280
or lifestyles that work for us.

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:02.210
So let's take food.

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:04.290
A lot of people that hear
about the paleo diet,

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:06.290
they just think of
the paleolithic.

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:12.996
And the basic
prescriptions are--

00:19:12.996 --> 00:19:15.120
all the conventional health
authorities pretty much

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:18.390
agree that too much industrial
foods is bad for you.

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:22.210
So all their advice,
from the Mayo Clinic

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:25.250
to Doctor Oz to Michael
Pollan to everybody

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:28.410
is basically avoid
industrial food.

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:32.430
Processed food--
Twinkies and Coca-Cola

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:35.700
and refined sugar and all that.

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.040
So it basically
boils down to, eat

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.760
like we did before the
Industrial Revolution.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.030
Eat like you sort of
grew up on a farm.

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:49.050
You had whole grain bread and
milk and cheese and organic.

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:51.460
Everything was organic.

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:52.706
We were still poor.

00:19:52.706 --> 00:19:53.830
But everything was organic.

00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:58.490
So all of that health
advice basically

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:00.149
boils down to eat like a farmer.

00:20:00.149 --> 00:20:01.190
Eat like a herder-farmer.

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:07.590
And that may be enough
for a lot of people.

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:11.110
Avoiding industrial food for
a lot of people, particularly

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:16.330
young people, may be
completely fine and sufficient.

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:18.710
But it's not for a
lot of other folks.

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:21.900
And so what paleo adds
to the mix is saying,

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:25.280
OK well, the Agricultural
Revolution introduced

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.660
two huge food groups
into the human diet

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:29.870
they basically
hadn't been consumed

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:36.670
before-- grains and legumes
and domesticated seeds,

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:40.470
basically, and dairy from
domesticated animals.

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:44.090
I don't know if anybody here
has milked a wild animal.

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:44.850
It's not easy.

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:48.260
It's possible, not easy.

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:52.700
So what this adds, a
little more perspective,

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:58.250
and says OK, well people
four hundred generations ago,

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:01.880
only started to eat
tons of wheat and corn

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:06.530
and diets shifted from
being very diverse,

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:08.150
lots of different
animal species,

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:09.930
lots of different
parts of the animal,

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:12.310
lots of different types
of plants depending

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:17.340
on the geography and the season,
to a diet heavily concentrated

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:23.370
in a few staple cereal crops--
wheat, corn, barley, oats.

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:26.470
And then products made from
that, bread and beer and things

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:27.340
like.

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:38.390
So paleo adds that piece
to the puzzle in food.

00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:42.310
So what I recommend
people do is-- first off,

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:45.140
if you feel fine with
your health and the way

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:50.400
that you're eating, there may
be no reason to change anything.

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:55.300
If you feel fine and there
aren't any issues, then

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:57.270
what's the problem?

00:21:57.270 --> 00:22:01.580
However, if eating
an agricultural diet

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:05.190
isn't working for you, then
what you might want to explore

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:09.890
is diets that were more common
during this prior period

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:13.410
in human evolution-- so
removing grains, removing dairy

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:18.770
for a time, and trying to mimic
an approximation-- we realize

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:20.980
it's an approximation.

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:24.460
And then add back in
novel modern foods

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:26.170
and see how you feel.

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:31.620
I know many people who are very
strict on gluten and grains.

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:33.780
Many have to be.

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:36.680
Many just want to be.

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:41.064
And I know more people
who are flex on dairy,

00:22:41.064 --> 00:22:42.480
and when they eat
it it'll be more

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:45.580
like full-fat traditional dairy.

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:48.642
And then just see how you feel.

00:22:48.642 --> 00:22:50.600
And this is sort of the
bio-hacking part of it.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.480
You've got to experiment.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:55.810
And based on your ancestry
and your genome and your gut

00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:57.840
bacteria and what
you like, you just

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.380
have to craft your own diet.

00:23:02.805 --> 00:23:04.180
Let me give you
one more example,

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:05.922
and then maybe we
can go to questions.

00:23:05.922 --> 00:23:07.130
I don't know what time it is.

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:07.970
AUDIENCE: It's about 3:30.

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:08.720
JOHN DURANT: 3:30?

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:14.670
The paleolithic doesn't
help you with all areas.

00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:17.260
And this is why I get a little
frustrated with the term paleo,

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:19.380
even though I use
it and promote it.

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:23.510
So take sleep, as an example.

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:26.440
The big change in
human sleep patterns

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:28.340
didn't happen between
the paleolithic

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:30.800
and the agricultural revolution.

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:34.390
People still lived with
their extended family

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:40.060
in fairly close quarters and had
no indoor lighting and things

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:41.270
like that.

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:44.620
The big transition in sleep was
between the Agricultural Age

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:48.080
and the Industrial Age when
you get indoor lighting,

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:52.265
you get more stimulants
like coffee and tea

00:23:52.265 --> 00:23:55.710
to keep people up,
more alco-- well

00:23:55.710 --> 00:24:02.530
I guess alcohol was way before--
clocks, things like that.

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:05.750
And then people increasingly
sleeping in isolation

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:10.280
from others, in their own rooms,
on softer and softer bedding.

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:14.130
So most of the big
key transition,

00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:17.544
most of the key changes,
when it comes to sleep,

00:24:17.544 --> 00:24:19.210
have nothing to do
with the paleolithic.

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:21.680
And you can actually
get an approximation

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:25.150
of a healthy way of
sleeping and sleep patterns

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:27.805
from looking at our
agricultural era ancestors.

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:33.530
So the paleolithic
doesn't always

00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:35.370
hold the solutions
to everything.

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:41.340
We don't always need it,
depending on the issue.

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:46.000
But people focus on
diet so much that that's

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.560
what it gets associated with.

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:53.380
Do I have anything else?

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:53.880
No.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:56.750
So if people now have
specific questions,

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:58.715
let's open it up to questions.

00:24:58.715 --> 00:25:03.080
AUDIENCE: What do you mean
exactly by [INAUDIBLE]?

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:03.955
JOHN DURANT: By what?

00:25:03.955 --> 00:25:06.780
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:14.780
JOHN DURANT: So people would
sleep near a fire, usually.

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:16.590
There were lots
of people around.

00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:19.450
There wasn't very much privacy.

00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:21.320
There are a lot
of folks who think

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:27.240
that sleep was less less of a
single uninterrupted stretch

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:30.610
of seven or eight hours and
more broken up into two periods.

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:33.350
Or you'd sleep for a
while, wake up, have sex,

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:36.890
go to the bathroom, chat
with someone by the fire,

00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:39.590
go back to sleep
for a few hours.

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:41.750
Night was a long time.

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:45.300
And you couldn't do
much when it was dark.

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.930
So that's sort of
what it was like.

00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:52.160
But it didn't change too much
when people started farming.

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.200
And then they were
living in little huts

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:57.870
with extended family
scrunched together

00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:00.870
around the fire for all night.

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:08.480
Other questions?

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.650
AUDIENCE: From on VC behind you.

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:12.410
You can't see me
actually, I think.

00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:13.076
JOHN DURANT: Hi.

00:26:15.606 --> 00:26:17.710
AUDIENCE: When I was at
[INAUDIBLE] from Hamburg,

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:19.640
Germany.

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:22.070
And thanks again
for doing all this.

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:23.975
Paleo has done a lot for me.

00:26:23.975 --> 00:26:26.100
Listened to you recently
on Robb Wolf again.

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:28.397
It's just amazing stuff
that you guys are doing.

00:26:28.397 --> 00:26:29.230
JOHN DURANT: Thanks.

00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:34.262
AUDIENCE: So my question
is-- so [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:34.262 --> 00:26:35.970
a lot of people around
you there as well.

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:37.511
I have a lot of
people, when you say,

00:26:37.511 --> 00:26:39.855
you know when people say they
are fine with what they're

00:26:39.855 --> 00:26:43.540
eating and they way they're
feeling, then [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:48.170
So the two questions that I have
around that is, you know, A,

00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:49.890
how do they know
that they couldn't

00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:51.710
feel much, much better, right?

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:53.760
I feel like we've been
doing that sort of stuff

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:54.426
for a long time.

00:26:54.426 --> 00:26:55.680
We don't even know.

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.600
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.680
JOHN DURANT: Right.

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.304
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] basically.

00:27:00.304 --> 00:27:00.970
All their lives.

00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:02.230
So, that's the one question.

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:06.300
The other one is, I
feel like-- so you

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.040
say a lot of young
people especially,

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:10.430
I think what you mean is
that a lot of people, their

00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:13.690
their metabolism is much more
forgiving than, for example,

00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:14.510
later in time.

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:15.000
JOHN DURANT: Right.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.416
AUDIENCE: What is
[INAUDIBLE] that

00:27:16.416 --> 00:27:20.678
is accumulating over this
period that sort of, you know,

00:27:20.678 --> 00:27:23.380
lifestyle, that
could be prevented,

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:27.700
and would not even lead to
issues in the 30s, 40s, 50s,

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:28.990
whenever.

00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:31.310
JOHN DURANT: So, thanks
for your questions.

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:33.720
For the first
question, yeah, people

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:39.660
tend to accept their
lives as normal.

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:42.190
They confuse the word
normal with common.

00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:42.690
I do it.

00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:43.730
Everybody here does it.

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:46.820
Just because it's
common in North America

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:48.490
to live a certain
way doesn't mean

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:55.980
it's necessarily species
typical in a biological sense.

00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:59.240
So they have the
same problem in zoos.

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:02.880
They run studies on the health
of all the captive gorillas

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.280
in North American zoos.

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.820
But they actually can't conclude
very much because they all

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:10.600
lead very similar lives and
very similar circumstances,

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:12.340
eating very similar food.

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:15.140
And so if you actually want to
see real differences in gorilla

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:18.090
help, you have to compare them
with their wild counterparts.

00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:23.680
But the reason why I say,
however you're eating,

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.680
if you feel great, fine
is partly because I

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:29.130
don't want to push
people too much.

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:32.720
And we can eat novel foods,
and we can live in new ways

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:33.800
and that's fine.

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:38.550
So I'm just trying to do more
of the soft sell, I guess.

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:41.970
But I think people
would be surprised

00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:50.410
about how many conditions
they accept as normal that

00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:53.120
don't necessarily have to be.

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:57.430
You get teenagers that
accept it as normal

00:28:57.430 --> 00:29:01.740
that they will need braces
and to get tons of acne.

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:05.640
And this causes like a
lot of social anxiety,

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:07.910
and like self-esteem issues.

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:12.090
And we treat it as this
normal rite of passage

00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:15.340
through adolescence.

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:18.320
But the reason why
our teeth are crowded

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:21.890
is because our jaws
have gotten smaller

00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:24.960
over the last some thousands of
years because the food we eat

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.150
isn't very tough.

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:27.450
It's very soft.

00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:30.110
And so our jaws
don't grow as large

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:33.960
as they do when we
had tougher foods.

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:38.610
And so our jaws aren't large
enough to fit all of our teeth.

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:42.110
And some of those
strong bite forces

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:45.480
are what the body uses to help
your teeth come in straight.

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.450
When you look at these
hunter gatherer skulls--

00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:50.690
and I've gotten to examine some
of them-- 80,000 years ago,

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:51.900
beautiful set of teeth.

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:54.182
Not perfect, but
wisdom teeth came in,

00:29:54.182 --> 00:29:56.390
there was enough room in
the jaw for the wisdom teeth

00:29:56.390 --> 00:29:57.530
to come in.

00:29:57.530 --> 00:29:59.730
No cavities.

00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:00.450
And straight.

00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:02.495
So that's--

00:30:02.495 --> 00:30:03.328
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry.

00:30:03.328 --> 00:30:06.817
Are you saying that's an
evolutionary change over 80,000

00:30:06.817 --> 00:30:08.805
years, or is that
a specific change

00:30:08.805 --> 00:30:11.290
over the lifetime because
an individual is chewing

00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:13.617
less, that their jaw grows less.

00:30:13.617 --> 00:30:15.530
JOHN DURANT: Individual
chewing less,

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:18.840
though there are some
lines of evidence

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:22.940
that maybe the human
had has actually

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:25.800
gotten a little bit smaller
over the last 10,000 years.

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:28.820
Our brains actually used
to be a little bit bigger

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:31.400
than they are today.

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.150
Near the end the paleolithic.

00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:36.550
I don't know what that means.

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:42.270
Your second question was about--
what was your second question?

00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:45.740
Oh youth, youth.

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:49.750
So definitely young
people can-- there's

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:53.160
very interesting evolutionary--
the evolutionary biology

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:55.260
of aging is a very
fascinating area.

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:58.590
There's a guy named Michael
Rose at UC Irvine who's probably

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:01.090
the preeminent
guy in this field.

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:07.080
And a lot of people think of
aging as sort of simply just

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:11.730
damage accumulating,
like a car rolls off

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:20.105
the lot at wherever
they sell cars--

00:31:20.105 --> 00:31:20.980
AUDIENCE: Dealership.

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:23.320
JOHN DURANT: --at a dealership.

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:25.620
And then from then on
out, it sort of just

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:27.760
accumulates damage.

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:34.890
But during the period of time
before the typical first stage

00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:40.950
of reproduction, we've basically
evolved incredible repair

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:42.550
mechanisms.

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:48.040
So let me put it this way, if
you get a genetic defect that

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:50.990
causes you to die when
you're four or five,

00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:54.940
your genes don't get passed on
to the next generation at all.

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:56.640
Kaput.

00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:57.380
You're out.

00:31:57.380 --> 00:31:59.220
You're out of the gene pool.

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:03.420
But if you get that same
genetic defect when you're 50,

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:06.540
you still have time
to have offspring.

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:10.370
So basically, depending
on the first typical age

00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:12.870
of reproduction of
a species, evolution

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:17.140
selects for incredible
robust health.

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:19.640
We grow stronger
as we get older.

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:24.030
We become more robust
from birth to adolescence,

00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:26.700
and then we start to
accumulate damage.

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:34.630
So young people are
actually pretty well adapted

00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:38.170
to some aspects of
an agricultural diet.

00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:40.190
Young people are
probably better adapted

00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:44.380
to some of those foods than
those same individuals later

00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:44.880
in life.

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:47.300
It's a very
counter-intuitive concept.

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:52.070
But there's been selection
pressures for young kids

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:54.530
to be able to survive
on these diets,

00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:57.830
to make it to the age
at which they reproduce.

00:32:57.830 --> 00:33:00.950
There has not been the
same sort of selection,

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:04.430
or as strong of selection,
for older people.

00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:07.220
So there are a lot of
people, for example,

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:11.040
who end up getting
Celiac later in life.

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:14.140
There was some traumatic
event, or childbirth,

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:16.190
or just getting older.

00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:19.220
Either Celiac or not being
able to digest lactose.

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:21.360
They become lactose
intolerant later in life.

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:24.110
You start to notice
it among folks.

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:28.040
My grandmother developed
Celiac late in life.

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:31.770
And it's possible that for
some of these more novel foods,

00:33:31.770 --> 00:33:33.511
we're better
adapted to them when

00:33:33.511 --> 00:33:35.760
we're young and less adapted
to them when we're older.

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:39.400
So it may become
more important to eat

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:43.920
more of a paleolithic
diet the older you get.

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:45.902
Some of that is hypothesis.

00:33:45.902 --> 00:33:48.360
AUDIENCE: Can I jump in on that
just really quickly, sorry.

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:51.050
AUDIENCE: Well let-- OK.

00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:54.840
AUDIENCE: Just because
it's a very tangible thing.

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:58.090
[INAUDIBLE] a lot of
money into keeping

00:33:58.090 --> 00:33:59.469
Googlers healthy, right?

00:33:59.469 --> 00:34:00.260
JOHN DURANT: Right.

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:03.456
Like free M&amp;Ms and
stuff like that?

00:34:03.456 --> 00:34:04.890
AUDIENCE: They've reduced those.

00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:09.699
AUDIENCE: And we get massages,
and adjustable tables and gyms

00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:11.550
and that sort of stuff.

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:13.863
And we have a lot of people
that started around age, I

00:34:13.863 --> 00:34:15.840
don't know, 20, 25 here.

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:17.920
And then as they
continue working here,

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:19.610
they get out of
shape, but they think

00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:21.989
that's the natural
course of life basically.

00:34:21.989 --> 00:34:25.260
So what would you tell Google
as a company to say, hey, look,

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:27.862
your people just don't have
to get sick and fat, right?

00:34:27.862 --> 00:34:29.406
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:29.406 --> 00:34:30.489
JOHN DURANT: That's right.

00:34:30.489 --> 00:34:33.340
Well, you could start
to model workplaces

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:36.050
on little hunter
gatherer tribes.

00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:37.500
Less clothing and things like.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.929
When you look at traditional
people, indigenous folks,

00:34:44.929 --> 00:34:49.190
living in traditional ways,
they have health problems

00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:50.900
of their own-- infant
mortality, things

00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:54.484
like that-- but they tend
to live into their 60s, 70s,

00:34:54.484 --> 00:34:58.110
and even the 80s in some
cases in robust health.

00:34:58.110 --> 00:35:02.850
The 70-year-olds, they're
not bed-ridden with arthritis

00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:04.160
and have Alzheimer's.

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:08.240
There like carrying pails
of water into their 70s

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:11.700
and hiking up hills
and things like that.

00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:14.970
And if you were a
hunter gatherer,

00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:18.390
you had to, at a minimum, be
able to move with your tribe

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:20.920
whenever it migrated.

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:28.670
And so it gives you a new
sense of what's normal.

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:32.190
What I like about the way that
Google thinks about health

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:35.530
is really thinking
about the habitat.

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:40.590
Saying OK, your habitat has a
big influence on whether you

00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:41.760
eat something or don't.

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:44.830
If we put a cover on it
and make it less visible,

00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:46.210
fewer people eat the candy.

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:49.710
I think that's one of the
changes that happened here.

00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:55.070
And what's good about
re-engineering your habitat

00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:59.750
is it doesn't require as much
willpower and discipline.

00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:02.270
So many people, when
they get into dieting,

00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:04.430
they think they're
changing themselves.

00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:06.210
Like I have to change myself.

00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:07.800
And I have to become
a better person.

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:10.600
And I'm going to do this through
willpower and discipline.

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:13.890
And that's part of the reason
why everybody fails at it.

00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:18.240
Because you can't-- nobody
is perfectly disciplined over

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:19.880
a long period of time.

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:24.660
You have to find ways
of using discipline

00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:27.150
in a short period of time
to change your habitat

00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:28.890
so that it makes it
easy to be healthy

00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:31.230
even when you're
not disciplined.

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:35.860
Or the way that you lead
your life, the food you eat

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:40.080
and how you move, it has to be
meaningful to you in some way.

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:43.140
Calories are not
meaningful to people.

00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:44.920
Most people are not
motivated by calories.

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:58.610
Going to hunt a wild animal
to bring back a lot of meat

00:36:58.610 --> 00:37:02.500
to try to impress the girl
in the tribe that you like,

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:04.280
that motivated people.

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:08.490
So you have to think about ways
to either change your habitat

00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:11.300
or make a healthy lifestyle
meaningful to people

00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:15.660
so that's it doesn't
require discipline.

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:18.600
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
when you said

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:21.540
there was a lot of danger in
doing agricultural industrial.

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:25.180
And I'm asking but now I'm
five days in [INAUDIBLE] all

00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:28.702
the things that can
happen if you make

00:37:28.702 --> 00:37:31.393
a switch from the
Information Age,

00:37:31.393 --> 00:37:33.351
where I've been eating
processed foods, breads,

00:37:33.351 --> 00:37:35.286
but then I just stop.

00:37:35.286 --> 00:37:35.786
Right?

00:37:35.786 --> 00:37:38.708
And I just stop and
start eating meant

00:37:38.708 --> 00:37:40.169
and vegetables and some fruits.

00:37:40.169 --> 00:37:44.968
And are there dangers
going the other way?

00:37:44.968 --> 00:37:48.454
Like, I read [INAUDIBLE]
so there's obviously

00:37:48.454 --> 00:37:50.695
a lot of fear factors,
but like how real are they

00:37:50.695 --> 00:37:52.153
for doing an abrupt
change in diet?

00:37:57.074 --> 00:37:58.490
JOHN DURANT: One
thing people will

00:37:58.490 --> 00:38:02.370
notice with abrupt changes
is particularly around sugar.

00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:04.570
People eat a lot of sugar today.

00:38:04.570 --> 00:38:07.720
And if you eat a lot of
sugar, and then you cut it out

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:09.340
of your diet, you're
basically going

00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:12.790
through withdrawal of a drug.

00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:15.420
And it's not pleasant.

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:17.730
Lightheadedness,
shaky hands, inability

00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:21.600
to concentrate, anxiety.

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:23.880
So that can be difficult.

00:38:27.310 --> 00:38:35.360
Unless somebody has some sort of
specific, severe health issue,

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:39.750
I do tend to think that trying
to go more or less whole hog,

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:44.090
for a short period of time,
is the best way to do it.

00:38:44.090 --> 00:38:48.810
And you just got a
monitor how you feel.

00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:50.070
You'll see better results.

00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:52.350
Or you'll have a
better validation

00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:53.650
of whatever results you get.

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:01.900
And you can harness that
period of discipline.

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:03.400
A lot of people
can be disciplined

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:04.950
for a week or two weeks.

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:08.340
Few people can just be
disciplined for two years.

00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:11.800
So rather than trying to go
sort of 5p% for a long period

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:14.970
of time, just going 100%.

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:21.840
Other risks-- with diet I don't
think there are as many risks.

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:24.030
With exercise, yeah.

00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:27.120
If people just like immediately
jump into a hard CrossFit

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:29.750
workout without
learning Olympic lifts,

00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:30.830
you can injure your back.

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:38.120
But for most people, sugar is
the biggest immediate obstacle.

00:39:41.686 --> 00:39:43.980
AUDIENCE: So I'm vegan.

00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:48.238
And I actually agree a lot
with the paleo mindset.

00:39:48.238 --> 00:39:50.050
I think there's a lot
more in common than--

00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:51.091
JOHN DURANT: I agree.

00:39:51.091 --> 00:39:53.846
AUDIENCE: --as far as focusing
on whole foods, et cetera.

00:39:56.536 --> 00:39:59.430
And I think it gets overblown
in the media how much meat you

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:00.418
do have to eat.

00:40:00.418 --> 00:40:02.394
I think too much is bad.

00:40:02.394 --> 00:40:04.864
I don't think
necessarily [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:04.864 --> 00:40:06.350
the only way to do things.

00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:08.414
So I was just
curious, kind of, I

00:40:08.414 --> 00:40:12.770
guess you thoughts on diet,
maybe your day-to-day diet.

00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:16.120
JOHN DURANT: Well let me talk
about the vegan/ paleo thing

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:17.150
for a second.

00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:21.190
In the press, it's often
portrayed as polar opposites.

00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:23.950
I do tend to think of paleo and
vegan as more like yin yang.

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:32.252
I have no problem with
people eating however

00:40:32.252 --> 00:40:32.960
they want to eat.

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:34.830
And I respect vegans
and vegetarians

00:40:34.830 --> 00:40:38.300
a lot for being
conscious eaters.

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:41.830
Where it does grate on me a
little bit is if people then

00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:45.490
turn around and say, this
is an optimal human diet.

00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:50.780
That's where I become a bit
more combative and disagree.

00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:55.800
And here's the thing.

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:58.860
Any dietary approach--
Atkins, vegan, paleo,

00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:03.340
whatever-- that gets people
to eat less industrial food,

00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:05.110
is going to work to some extent.

00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:10.640
Less refined sugar, refined
flour, high fructose corn

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:11.380
syrup.

00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:14.070
Any approach that gets
people to reduce that

00:41:14.070 --> 00:41:17.830
will have some success
at least for a time.

00:41:17.830 --> 00:41:21.410
And then, I have much more
in common with how vegans

00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:29.110
eat than probably the
average Western diet.

00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:30.220
What was the last piece?

00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:32.010
How do I eat on a daily basis?

00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:33.790
AUDIENCE: Yeah what's
your day-to-day?

00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:36.010
JOHN DURANT: I often
don't eat breakfast.

00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:39.690
I don't wake up terribly hungry.

00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:43.720
Sometimes, if I do have
breakfast, I'll have some eggs

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:45.180
and spinach.

00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:47.710
Or I'll have a bowl of
heavy cream, because I

00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:54.130
eat some dairy, and a sliced
up banana, which is delicious.

00:41:54.130 --> 00:41:56.730
Lunch-- sushi.

00:41:56.730 --> 00:41:59.390
I don't worry about a little
bit of white rice or anything

00:41:59.390 --> 00:42:01.630
like that.

00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:06.510
Sushi, sashimi, Mongolian
barbecue, meat and vegetables,

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:09.540
a Cobb salad,
something like that.

00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:13.360
And then dinner would be a
piece of fish, sweet potato,

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:14.920
and a side salad.

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:18.980
I mean, it's not that radical.

00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:23.170
But it is radical over
an extended period

00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:27.460
when you realize that
gluten and wheat and corn

00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:31.000
are in everything
in the grocery store

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.160
except for a few things
around the outside.

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:37.070
AUDIENCE: Question
from VC behind you.

00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:38.360
JOHN DURANT: Hi.

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:40.260
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned white rice.

00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:43.410
And I eat white rice
myself because I think it

00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:47.640
doesn't-- at least it doesn't
feel as bad wheat does.

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:51.345
So, and I also read some studies
saying that among grains,

00:42:51.345 --> 00:42:52.970
you might actually
be better off eating

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:57.425
white rice than brown
rice even, in moderation.

00:42:57.425 --> 00:42:58.760
So thought on that.

00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:01.055
And I'm going to throw in
a second question, which

00:43:01.055 --> 00:43:08.166
is you mentioned metabolism as
the damage analogy for aging.

00:43:08.166 --> 00:43:12.539
So the simple logic is that
the faster your metabolism

00:43:12.539 --> 00:43:13.830
the faster you're going to age.

00:43:13.830 --> 00:43:15.935
But then again, I
find, for instance,

00:43:15.935 --> 00:43:19.435
if I sleep on a cold, hard bed,
I feel better in the morning,

00:43:19.435 --> 00:43:22.060
and logically I feel like that's
the better things to be doing.

00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:25.279
But then part of me is
thinking, isn't my body

00:43:25.279 --> 00:43:27.570
trying to burn more fuel to
stay warm during the night.

00:43:27.570 --> 00:43:30.890
So I don't know if you
have any thoughts on that.

00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:33.760
JOHN DURANT: Well,
on rice first.

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:39.520
In my mental model of
grains, wheat is the worst.

00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:41.900
And rice is the least
worst, or the best.

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:49.380
Let me give you the
10,000 foot view seeds.

00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:53.150
And when I say seeds, I
mean the reproductive organ

00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:56.760
of the plant, and I'm including
grains, legumes, nuts,

00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:58.830
and seeds.

00:43:58.830 --> 00:44:04.206
Seeds, as the reproductive
organ of the plants,

00:44:04.206 --> 00:44:07.340
have many nutrients
in them because it's

00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:10.180
to feed the next generation.

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:14.580
They also have
defense mechanisms.

00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:16.990
Sometimes a shell, which
is nature's way of saying

00:44:16.990 --> 00:44:18.370
stay out.

00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:23.000
Or chemicals, toxins or
naturally occurring pesticides.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.850
Plants can't run
away from predators.

00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:27.290
They are not mobile.

00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:29.460
So they have to use
other mechanisms

00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:33.190
to defend their offspring or
the reproductive interests.

00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:35.160
And they usually
do that by making

00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:40.630
seeds or the entire plant
toxic in some way to insects

00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:42.210
or herbivores.

00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:45.580
They might be OK--
I'm giving them

00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:52.750
agency metaphorically-- they
might be OK with an herbivore

00:44:52.750 --> 00:44:54.200
coming along,
eating their seeds,

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:56.490
and then not digesting
them and then letting

00:44:56.490 --> 00:44:58.370
them come out in their feces.

00:44:58.370 --> 00:45:02.110
But they're still then
covered in a casing

00:45:02.110 --> 00:45:03.625
to prevent them
from being digested.

00:45:06.850 --> 00:45:10.630
Wild almonds contain
cyanide in them.

00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:12.580
Apple seeds also
have cyanide in them.

00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:15.110
Many fruit pits are poisonous.

00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:19.460
And every year some kid
will eat like a peach pit

00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:22.720
or a nectarine pit and have to
go to poison control or die.

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:28.470
You basically go
through seeds, and it's

00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:32.790
a huge list of things that
can irritate the stomach

00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:35.090
or the reproductive
system of the animals

00:45:35.090 --> 00:45:36.980
that are consuming them.

00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:39.790
Sheep in New Zealand
and Australia,

00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:42.830
you have to keep them away
from certain pasture legumes

00:45:42.830 --> 00:45:45.210
because if the ewes
eat too many of them,

00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:48.470
they have higher rates of
miscarriage or become fertile,

00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:51.510
which is an adaptation.

00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:53.780
That's exactly what
the legumes "want"

00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:58.370
to do because any ewes
that have a taste for them

00:45:58.370 --> 00:46:01.320
don't have offspring.

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:07.340
So there's a general
concern with eating diets

00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:11.550
that are high in seeds,
particularly the same seed

00:46:11.550 --> 00:46:17.400
over and over, because they can
cause a lot of health problems

00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:19.250
in concentrated qualities.

00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:21.440
And if they're not prepared
in traditional ways.

00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:24.420
Traditional ways of preparing
nuts and seeds and grains

00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:32.420
and legumes-- soaking,
fermenting, baking, sprouting.

00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:35.860
All of these traditional
methods of preparing seeds

00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:39.050
were ways of deactivating some
of these problematic toxins

00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:39.580
in them.

00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:41.010
And we've sort of
forgotten that.

00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:45.360
And now we eat tons of
wheat, corn, and soy prepared

00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:47.000
in untraditional ways.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.980
And so that's the main reason
for being skeptical of them

00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:52.850
from the outset.

00:46:52.850 --> 00:46:54.810
White rice is
basically carbohydrate.

00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:58.870
If you want more carbohydrate
in your diet, eat it.

00:46:58.870 --> 00:47:00.536
If you want less, don't.

00:47:00.536 --> 00:47:03.750
I like the texture of it.

00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:05.030
So I eat it.

00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:08.670
And I can handle
the carbohydrate.

00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:10.326
What was your other question?

00:47:10.326 --> 00:47:13.303
AUDIENCE: It was about
whether increasing metabolism

00:47:13.303 --> 00:47:16.370
by wearing less clothing
or exposure to the cold

00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:17.620
is a good thing because then--

00:47:20.810 --> 00:47:22.520
JOHN DURANT: Yeah
I'm not sure I have

00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:25.850
a very good answer
to that question.

00:47:25.850 --> 00:47:32.200
I don't know how much trying
to slow down your metabolism

00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:35.770
is feasible, and how much
it might or might not

00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:38.260
add to your longevity
at the end of your life.

00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:41.610
Is it an extra 20 days
when you're 87 years old?

00:47:41.610 --> 00:47:43.120
I don't know.

00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:46.590
So I would do whatever.

00:47:46.590 --> 00:47:50.140
If you get better sleep
on a harder surface when

00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:54.970
it's chilly, then
I would do that.

00:47:54.970 --> 00:47:58.310
And yeah--

00:47:58.310 --> 00:48:00.920
AUDIENCE: I'm personally
really glad I do paleo,

00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:03.780
and I feel fortunate that
I can, because there's

00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:05.590
a farmer's market
that I can go to.

00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:08.630
And I have the wherewithal to
buy expensive grass-fed beef.

00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:11.780
And I live in a country that
gives me an internet where

00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:14.780
I can go and I read your
blog and listen to podcasts.

00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:21.690
Is there a future for paleo in
Africa or in Southeast Asia?

00:48:21.690 --> 00:48:25.290
Is there a future where billions
of people around the world

00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:26.150
are eating paleo?

00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:28.255
And can be sustain that?

00:48:30.642 --> 00:48:32.850
Is it just sort of like a
fad that upper middle-class

00:48:32.850 --> 00:48:34.840
people in America
are going to embrace?

00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:39.180
JOHN DURANT: Well, we can learn
a lot about human health even

00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:42.160
if everybody in the world
does not adopt this diet,

00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:42.980
which they won't.

00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:46.300
Even if everybody had the
capability to do so, everybody

00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:47.940
wouldn't.

00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:51.020
So first, the benefit
of some people

00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:53.970
experimenting with
this is simply

00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:58.860
learning about human metabolism
and what makes folks healthy.

00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:06.590
Right now, the early
years of paleo-- people

00:49:06.590 --> 00:49:09.940
are painting with broad strokes.

00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:11.850
Grains are bad.

00:49:11.850 --> 00:49:14.610
Well maybe it will turn
out, over years of research,

00:49:14.610 --> 00:49:17.870
that gluten grains
are the worst.

00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:22.450
But if you're dealing with
non-gluten grains, quinoa

00:49:22.450 --> 00:49:26.170
or something else, many
people can digest that better.

00:49:26.170 --> 00:49:28.920
Or maybe we'll
learn that you just

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:31.490
need to introduce certain
types of gut bacteria

00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:33.510
into people's
stomachs and then they

00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:37.010
have fewer negative reactions
to a particular grain.

00:49:37.010 --> 00:49:42.080
So, there may be changes in
how we think about paleo,

00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:44.580
or how we think about
different grains that

00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:47.050
make it more
accessible to people.

00:49:47.050 --> 00:49:50.510
Or make aspect of
paleo irrelevant.

00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:54.300
You mentioned the insect
company-- or the cricket

00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:56.370
protein bar company
that I'm helping out.

00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:03.200
Insects are eaten as a
nutritious and inexpensive

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:06.010
source of protein
all over the world,

00:50:06.010 --> 00:50:08.650
except for the Western world.

00:50:08.650 --> 00:50:12.010
But even crickets,
grasshoppers, and locusts

00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:15.950
are fine under kosher
and halal rules.

00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:19.200
And there's really
no good reason

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:23.290
other than a sense of
discuss and tradition,

00:50:23.290 --> 00:50:28.480
recent tradition, to avoid
eating insects and taking

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:30.190
advantage of them.

00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:34.930
The amino acid
profile of insects

00:50:34.930 --> 00:50:37.920
is beautiful, most of them.

00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:42.970
You don't have to sort of mix
and match protein sources.

00:50:42.970 --> 00:50:50.730
They require fewer resources
to raise, water in particular.

00:50:50.730 --> 00:50:55.450
And for ethical reasons, they
have a less well-developed

00:50:55.450 --> 00:50:59.680
neurological system,
and are adapted

00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:01.440
to living in very
close quarters.

00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:05.890
So that's an area where
paleo could actually,

00:51:05.890 --> 00:51:12.850
in some respects, make healthy
eating more sustainable.

00:51:12.850 --> 00:51:17.650
But is everybody going to
live off of grass-fed beef?

00:51:17.650 --> 00:51:18.300
No.

00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:22.420
But you have a small group
of people making innovations,

00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:26.290
and it also incentivizes
the big players,

00:51:26.290 --> 00:51:28.460
the big agricultural
companies to start

00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:30.580
to make changes to
how they do things.

00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:33.050
And they can make small
tweaks in their supply chain,

00:51:33.050 --> 00:51:35.380
or in their
treatment of animals,

00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:38.700
that can have a huge
difference on the environment

00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:42.150
and on ethical issues, simply
because they're now responding

00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:46.300
to a 2% of the market, 3% of the
market, 5% of the market that

00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:49.810
is profitable and growing
that they want to get in on.

00:51:52.349 --> 00:51:53.265
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:55.872 --> 00:51:56.830
JOHN DURANT: All right.

00:51:56.830 --> 00:52:01.333
AUDIENCE: When you look
at the line from paleo up,

00:52:01.333 --> 00:52:04.347
the idea agricultural
societies fare

00:52:04.347 --> 00:52:06.842
better because they made
cheaper [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:06.842 --> 00:52:07.840
That's why.

00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:09.620
It's an evolutionary
process also--

00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:09.900
JOHN DURANT: Right.

00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:10.460
It's growth.

00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:13.813
AUDIENCE: --but And
so I guess like,

00:52:13.813 --> 00:52:16.687
do you think the cricket
thing is like-- I mean,

00:52:16.687 --> 00:52:18.795
those calories are going
to be more expensive.

00:52:18.795 --> 00:52:22.020
It's more expensive
than simple grains.

00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:26.202
So it's less efficient,
more expensive calories.

00:52:26.202 --> 00:52:28.259
Is that the right
thing to do when

00:52:28.259 --> 00:52:30.550
throughout all these periods,
and we're thinking about,

00:52:30.550 --> 00:52:33.362
how are we going to get enough
calories to feed everybody?

00:52:33.362 --> 00:52:34.778
Like throughout
these times, there

00:52:34.778 --> 00:52:36.425
have been a hundred
people who've

00:52:36.425 --> 00:52:37.966
been like, oh my
god, we're not going

00:52:37.966 --> 00:52:38.828
to be able to feed
all these people.

00:52:38.828 --> 00:52:40.292
And they come up
with some new way

00:52:40.292 --> 00:52:43.220
of breeding some kind of
corn, and then OK cool--

00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:45.740
JOHN DURANT: Right,
well right now, there

00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:47.540
are enough calories
to feed every one,

00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:51.750
and the main impediments are
institutions and infrastructure

00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:56.740
and growth in poor
parts of the world.

00:52:56.740 --> 00:53:00.390
But if more people
continue to eat meat,

00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:04.230
that does take more resources
and things like that.

00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:09.060
The problem with
corn or soy or any

00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:10.710
of these grains
as protein sources

00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:12.680
is they're not very
good protein sources.

00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:14.300
They're incomplete.

00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:16.500
And eaten in large
quantities, they

00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:18.450
can cause health problems too.

00:53:18.450 --> 00:53:24.440
So I don't know all the
details of the ins and outs

00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:27.580
of the resources
required to grow insects.

00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:30.000
We're sort of exploring
that right now.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:35.470
But it's worth
exploring, I think.

00:53:35.470 --> 00:53:37.895
AUDIENCE: What's
[INAUDIBLE] hacking

00:53:37.895 --> 00:53:39.935
that this is predicated on.

00:53:39.935 --> 00:53:42.848
I was wondering-- let's
say my real estate

00:53:42.848 --> 00:53:44.796
for my grandchildren
[INAUDIBLE].

00:53:49.179 --> 00:53:56.270
What about [INAUDIBLE]
cheaper diet with fast food?

00:53:56.270 --> 00:53:59.478
Then you move back
towards an expensive diet

00:53:59.478 --> 00:54:01.918
of very good quality food.

00:54:01.918 --> 00:54:03.870
Wouldn't we want, a
million years from now,

00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:05.822
everyone to just
get refined sugar

00:54:05.822 --> 00:54:09.290
and be perfectly fine with it,
and go on with their lives,

00:54:09.290 --> 00:54:11.070
rather than everybody
going back to--

00:54:11.070 --> 00:54:12.778
JOHN DURANT: Well that
will never happen.

00:54:12.778 --> 00:54:14.200
AUDIENCE: How do you know?

00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:15.325
JOHN DURANT: Well, I mean--

00:54:15.325 --> 00:54:17.911
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:54:17.911 --> 00:54:19.410
JOHN DURANT:
--evolution takes time.

00:54:19.410 --> 00:54:20.744
It takes many, many generations.

00:54:20.744 --> 00:54:22.784
AUDIENCE: I'm just wondering
about the direction.

00:54:22.784 --> 00:54:23.810
Why not move--

00:54:23.810 --> 00:54:25.462
AUDIENCE: Bioengineering
is faster.

00:54:25.462 --> 00:54:27.386
AUDIENCE: Yeah, why
are we not moving

00:54:27.386 --> 00:54:31.800
in that direction [INAUDIBLE]
perfectly fine [INAUDIBLE]?

00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:36.310
JOHN DURANT: Well this is
an area where I'm probably

00:54:36.310 --> 00:54:38.800
in a little bit of tension
with some of the folks here,

00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:41.450
or the tech world.

00:54:41.450 --> 00:54:44.580
Throughout history,
you have engineers

00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:47.320
who are very hubristic and think
that they can centrally plan

00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:52.300
and design things
better than nature does,

00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:55.000
or a better than a
decentralized process does.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.670
And many times they can,
then occasionally they

00:54:57.670 --> 00:55:00.680
fail magnificently.

00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:06.700
So yes, we can produce more
calories with wheat and corn,

00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:08.030
and feed more people.

00:55:08.030 --> 00:55:10.160
And we can adapt to that
somewhat over periods

00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:11.010
of generations.

00:55:11.010 --> 00:55:12.800
But it also exposes
you to famine.

00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:15.670
You basically didn't have
famine until we became heavily

00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:19.060
dependent on a few cereal
grains, and in a sense,

00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:22.393
we put all our
eggs in one basket.

00:55:22.393 --> 00:55:26.722
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
famine throughout

00:55:26.722 --> 00:55:31.532
recorded and unrecorded history
and various cultures going back

00:55:31.532 --> 00:55:34.164
tens of thousands of years.

00:55:34.164 --> 00:55:35.580
JOHN DURANT: Hunter
gatherers tend

00:55:35.580 --> 00:55:41.247
to have more diverse
diets than other people.

00:55:41.247 --> 00:55:42.080
And they're nomadic.

00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:44.690
So when you have a
more diverse portfolio,

00:55:44.690 --> 00:55:48.190
you're less likely-- you're
less dependent on any one food

00:55:48.190 --> 00:55:49.290
source.

00:55:49.290 --> 00:55:51.820
If it fails, it's
not catastrophic.

00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:54.490
And if you're nomadic, you
can quickly up and move.

00:55:54.490 --> 00:55:58.410
So it's well established
among anthropologists

00:55:58.410 --> 00:56:01.080
that-- it's not to say
there weren't periods

00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:07.380
when people ran out of
food or went hungry.

00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:11.520
But famine shot
up when we started

00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:13.050
betting on a few cereal grains.

00:56:13.050 --> 00:56:14.785
And if you didn't
get enough rain,

00:56:14.785 --> 00:56:17.142
or if you didn't store enough
grain, boom, you're done.

00:56:17.142 --> 00:56:17.850
You're wiped out.

00:56:17.850 --> 00:56:21.150
AUDIENCE: There was a lot more
people to starve. [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:22.900
population controlled
through agriculture.

00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:25.970
But the Inuit, for example,
starved regularly up

00:56:25.970 --> 00:56:29.935
until they integrated
into the modern day,

00:56:29.935 --> 00:56:33.890
into the rest of the world.

00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:36.430
JOHN DURANT: I don't
know details on that.

00:56:36.430 --> 00:56:39.739
But I bet I would
disagree with you on that.

00:56:39.739 --> 00:56:40.655
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:46.460
JOHN DURANT: Like soylent,
like than just raised--

00:56:46.460 --> 00:56:49.226
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
eventually the human organism

00:56:49.226 --> 00:56:50.610
is going to adapt to it.

00:56:50.610 --> 00:56:53.140
JOHN DURANT: No, no, no, no, no.

00:56:53.140 --> 00:57:00.140
So you only get
adaptation if people--

00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:04.370
if there's differential
reproductive success--

00:57:04.370 --> 00:57:09.125
if some people are having more
babies and other people aren't.

00:57:09.125 --> 00:57:14.770
So you would need, over a
very long period of time,

00:57:14.770 --> 00:57:18.660
you would need the people
that are thriving best

00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:25.585
on heavily industrial diets to
also have the most children.

00:57:25.585 --> 00:57:27.960
I mean, maybe the Chinese are
willing to do an experiment

00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:28.590
like that.

00:57:28.590 --> 00:57:31.900
But not in like a
democratic society.

00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:40.540
And it requires-- even lactose
tolerance is only in about 30--

00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:44.760
it's one gene that
had enormous benefits.

00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:48.400
One gene, enormous benefits,
and it only moved to about 35%

00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:52.520
of the population in a
6,000 or 7,000 year period.

00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:54.790
That is like the
most rapid example

00:57:54.790 --> 00:57:57.140
that we have of
something with one

00:57:57.140 --> 00:58:01.010
gene that needs to be flipped,
enormous benefits and even

00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:03.930
over 7,000 years or whatever.

00:58:03.930 --> 00:58:06.870
It's 35% of global population.

00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:13.600
So it's not feasible
to think that we're

00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:15.234
going to change through--

00:58:15.234 --> 00:58:16.150
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:19.050 --> 00:58:22.730
JOHN DURANT: Well there
are other mechanisms.

00:58:22.730 --> 00:58:30.810
Bill Gates has been investing
in artificial meat sources.

00:58:30.810 --> 00:58:34.300
There are bioengineers
working on-- there

00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:37.050
may be ways of
engineering bacteria,

00:58:37.050 --> 00:58:41.850
or harnessing bacteria to
basically digest inedible food

00:58:41.850 --> 00:58:47.640
sources for us, and then
we can digest the output.

00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:54.050
So I think that's where the
innovation will happen, not so

00:58:54.050 --> 00:58:56.320
much in whether we
change our own genome

00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:57.575
or anything like that.

00:58:57.575 --> 00:58:59.555
AUDIENCE: So we're
actually overtime now.

00:58:59.555 --> 00:59:01.000
Can you stick
around a little bit?

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.410
JOHN DURANT: Sure,
yeah, I can hang.

00:59:02.410 --> 00:59:04.080
AUDIENCE: He'll stick around if
you have any extra questions.

00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:05.080
Thanks for coming, John.

00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:07.737
The book's in the back.
$10.00 subsidized by Google.

00:59:07.737 --> 00:59:08.278
Check it out.

00:59:08.278 --> 00:59:08.774
It's an awesome book.

00:59:08.774 --> 00:59:09.270
Thanks John.

00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:10.020
JOHN DURANT: Cool.

00:59:10.020 --> 00:59:11.270
Thank you.
