Everyone knows that guy or gal who's super
smart, and can play soccer while reciting

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:14.240
Yeats backwards who also happens to be a SUPER
HUGE POTHEAD WHATSUPWITHDAT?!

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.530
Hey y'all, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:27.300
This week a new 30 year, 39,000 person Canadian
study came out comparing tobacco smoking teens

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.410
with pot smoking teens.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.380
Researchers learned the popularity of pot
and cigarettes in 1981 was the opposite of

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.380
today.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.190
Back then cigarettes were the norm and pot
was the strange habit; now it's swapped!

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.949
On top of changing of social norms, the study
ALSO found, pot smokers do better in school

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:48.070
than their tobacco smoking peers!

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.770
This got us asking: is the smart pothead a
stereotype?

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.369
Well, it doesn't make you dumber, at least,
not for long.

00:00:55.369 --> 00:01:00.370
A study from Australian National University
found the belief of the dumb pothead is based

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.280
on an accidental statistical bias!

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.300
Once the researchers began to control for
intelligence, income and social ability science

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.680
found people who smoke pot aren't dumber.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.320
And a 2001 study by Harvard found long-term
heavy pot users DO mess up their short-term

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.190
memory, but if they quit for a month, it comes
back.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.590
We know IQ can be controversial, but a long-term
study in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.170
Health took the IQ of 8,000 British children
aged 5 and 10 years old in the 1970s.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.890
Then they went back to those same people and
asked them about their psychological distress

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.810
and drug use at ages 16 and 30.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.440
The researchers controlled for anxiety and
depression as a teen, parental social class,

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.500
and lifetime income levels.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.530
By the time the subjects were 30, one in three
men and one in six women had used pot!

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.659
Turns out, men and women with high IQ scores
at age 5, were 50-percent more likely to be

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:06.640
in the using population at 30; with the brainy
ladies using more than the dudes!

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.450
The researchers decided these smartypants
were using either as a coping mechanism, from

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.860
years of bullying and social exclusion, or
perhaps because smarter people crave novel

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.640
experiences and sensations.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.170
They're going to dig deeper with more research.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.420
But with all these studies there is no evidence
that pot can make us smarter.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.220
I did find a study from 2010 which found cannabis
users performed better at some semantic memory

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.220
tests.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.030
Basically, the brain connects related words
more easily, but that's really it.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.540
It does appear to make you less motivated,
though.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.730
There is new evidence that marijuana makes
it hard to activate the brain's reward system.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.320
Their brains are awash with dopamine, but
the reward system is blunted by cannabinoids

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.270
in the herb and fails to give you the get-up
and go.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.710
And new studies show marijuana can be psychologically
addictive and require psychotherapy and medication

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.350
to treat dependency.

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.099
Bottom-line: there's NO causation for pot
MAKING HUMANS SMARTER.

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:09.940
But chances are the honor roll is totally
rolling.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.620
This makes sense, because the smart kids usually
WORK HARDER, so they probably party harder

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.620
too.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.620
How do you feel about this?

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.340
