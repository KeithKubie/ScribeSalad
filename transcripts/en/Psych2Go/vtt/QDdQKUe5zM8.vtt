00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
[Cheerful music]

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.280
Psychology can reveal some crazy things that can surprise even the experts.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:17.500
In the last few years, a ton of insane psychological studies have been done by equally crazy researchers.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.360
But the craziest thing of all, is that they've actually struck gold.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.640
These studies have revealed some of the most surprising facts in the world of psychology,

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.180
and some of this new information is even disproving previously held beliefs.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.520
And the best part of all is that these facts are about some of the things -

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.580
- that everybody's talking about right now.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.720
Things like love, sex, Facebook, the newest iPhone -

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.440
- and, of course, Donald Trump.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.340
One: Loneliness hurts. Literally.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.240
An amazing study has recently discovered that the emotion of loneliness -

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.500
- does incredible harm on both our mind and body.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.600
The study, which was done in 2015 by Nancy J. Donovan through the National Health Institute -

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.580
- sampled 8.300 adults over the age of 65.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.240
Every two years they were surveyed.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.540
And at the beginning, 17% of them admitted they suffered from loneliness.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.480
Over the next twelve years,

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.960
- the researchers realized that the people who said that they were suffering from loneliness,

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.040
- were suffering from a 20% faster decrease in cognitive ability and brain function.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.400
A separate study showed that those who were suffering from loneliness -

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.780
- had an almost 15% higher chance of dying prematurely.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.340
Two: Having sexual fantasies means you're healthy, not sick-minded.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.600
People with weird sexual fantasies have long been considered mentally unstable or weird.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.440
But a new study that came out in 2013,

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.680
- suggests that those with sexual fantasies are actually mentally healthier than those who don't.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.240
A study, which was released in the Journal of Sexual Medicine,

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.580
- has a lot of people rethinking sexual fantasies and kinks.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:59.300
902 people who practice BDSM were compared with 434 people who just have normal sex.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.160
The results were surprising.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.540
Those who practice BDSM were less neurotic, more open with their partners -

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.800
- and more sensitive and open to rejection.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:13.260
Not only that, but they seemed to be more secure in their relationships, and were generally happier.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.860
Three: Facebook *will* make you depressed.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.720
Everyone who is addicted to Facebook needs to listen up right now.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.760
A new study released in 2015 by the Palo Alto University and the University of Houston,

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.380
has discovered that increased Facebook usage is linked to depression.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.800
That's right.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.620
The technology that is supposed to connect us with our friends -

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.220
- is actually making us more lonely and depressed.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.540
Why is this?

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.940
According to the study, which was published in the Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology,

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.300
- this is because people are comparing themselves to other people.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.440
In other words,

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.320
Facebook turns our social life into a competition of who has the most friends and who is having the most fun.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.500
Four: iPhone users really *do* think they're better than everyone else.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.360
In 2016,

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.660
- a psychological study was done by the University of Lincoln in cooperation with two other schools.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.280
What they were studying was something that's become huge in recent years: the iPhone.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.600
The choice of whether a user chose Apple or Android revealed a lot about their personality.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.160
Dr. David Ellis of Lancaster University, said:

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.680
"In the study, we demonstrated for the first time that an individual's choice of smartphone operating system -

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.120
- can provide useful clues when it comes to predicting their personality -

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.260
and other individual characteristics."

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:32.620
In other words,

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.960
The smartphone has become an extension of ourselves, including our personality.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.520
A study found that iPhone users think that their phone represents their social economic and status -

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.700
- and are more self-conscious and extroverted.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.580
In addition, they also try to look different.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.300
On the positive side, they also tend to be more open and sensitive.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.360
Five: Liberals are breaking record stress levels because of Trump.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.620
A new survey has shown that Americans are more stressed out then they've ever been before -

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.240
- and that's no coincidence.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.320
It turns out that the most stressed out people in the U.S. right now, are liberals.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.100
And it doesn't take a genius to figure out why.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.880
Every year, the American Psychological Association posts its annual stress survey of America,

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.300
- and 2017's edition broke all existing records for stress levels.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.120
They found out, that liberals were the most stressed out people in America right now,

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.080
- and that more than half of over a thousand people surveyed said that the current political climate -

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.280
- was a very or somewhat significant source of stress.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:39.320
In addition, a full 2/3 of respondents to the survey said that they are stressed out about the nation's future.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.920
Six: Going for a walk could be the ultimate way to cure... everything.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.700
Who could have thought that merely going for a walk could be so helpful to your mental health?

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.540
A recent study, released in 2016 by Iowa State University,

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.620
- found that just 12 minutes of walking can increase one's mood massively.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.120
Another study released by Stanford University in 2014,

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.060
- suggests that walking can increase creativity by up to 60%.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.620
Yet another study released in 2010 by the University of Illinois,

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.720
- suggests that walking can create more sparks and connections between neurons.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.240
A further study released in 2009 in the European Journal of Developmental Psychology,

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.300
- suggests that walking can actually improve memory.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.980
Which one of these new studies surprised you the most?

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.580
Which ones can you relate to?

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.960
