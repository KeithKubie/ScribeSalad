literature there's a set of ideas called

the sliding windows idea and you would

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910
the sliding windows idea and you would
 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.080

take a trained classifier and run it

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090

know why fat regions try to find cars

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120
know why fat regions try to find cars
 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.300

well so that's the are CNN or the region

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200
well so that's the are CNN or the region

now it turns out the our CNN Avram is

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690
now it turns out the our CNN Avram is
 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.470
now it turns out the our CNN Avram is
still quite slow so there's been a line

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480
still quite slow so there's been a line
 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.200

of work to explore how to speed up this

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210
of work to explore how to speed up this
 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.170

algorithm so the basic our CNN algorithm

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180
algorithm so the basic our CNN algorithm
 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.120
algorithm so the basic our CNN algorithm
would propose regions using some

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130
would propose regions using some
 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.070
would propose regions using some
algorithm and then classify the Patrol's

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080
algorithm and then classify the Patrol's
 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.830
algorithm and then classify the Patrol's
regions one at a time and for each of

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840
regions one at a time and for each of
 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.020
regions one at a time and for each of
the regions it will output the label so

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030
the regions it will output the label so
 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.790
the regions it will output the label so
they're a car is there a pedestrian is

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800
they're a car is there a pedestrian is
 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.820
they're a car is there a pedestrian is
there a motorcycle there and also output

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830
there a motorcycle there and also output
 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.740
there a motorcycle there and also output
a bounding box so you can get an

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750
a bounding box so you can get an
 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.260
a bounding box so you can get an
accurate bounding box if indeed there is

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270
accurate bounding box if indeed there is
 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.160
accurate bounding box if indeed there is
a object in that region so just to be

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170
a object in that region so just to be
 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.470
a object in that region so just to be
clear the our CNN algorithm doesn't just

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480
clear the our CNN algorithm doesn't just
 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.080
clear the our CNN algorithm doesn't just
trust the bounding box it was given it
