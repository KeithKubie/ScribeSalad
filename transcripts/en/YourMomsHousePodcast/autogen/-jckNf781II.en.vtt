it goes right away on the ice glacier

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270
it goes right away on the ice glacier
 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.420
it goes right away on the ice glacier
and freezes up this water is around

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430
and freezes up this water is around
 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.330
and freezes up this water is around
15,000 years old what's in the bottle

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340
15,000 years old what's in the bottle
 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.929
15,000 years old what's in the bottle
right here and I see the picture right

right here and I see the picture right
 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.249
right here and I see the picture right
here so they're harvesting these

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259
here so they're harvesting these
 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.630
here so they're harvesting these
icebergs and all some people would say

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640
icebergs and all some people would say
 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.580
icebergs and all some people would say
like are you not smart and so you you we

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590
like are you not smart and so you you we
 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.990
like are you not smart and so you you we
all know like global warming and

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000
all know like global warming and
 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.640
all know like global warming and
everything yeah oh you're like taking

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650
everything yeah oh you're like taking
 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.410
everything yeah oh you're like taking
the icebergs even my way yeah no these

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420
the icebergs even my way yeah no these
 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.030
the icebergs even my way yeah no these
are icebergs whoo breaking down like

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040
are icebergs whoo breaking down like
 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.990
are icebergs whoo breaking down like
totally normal

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000
totally normal
 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.210
totally normal
they're starting to dilute then into the

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220
they're starting to dilute then into the
 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.710
they're starting to dilute then into the
North Sea and when they are deluded you

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720
North Sea and when they are deluded you
 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.270
North Sea and when they are deluded you
cannot use that water anymore then it's

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280
cannot use that water anymore then it's
 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.950
cannot use that water anymore then it's
like heavily salted yeah so they're

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960
like heavily salted yeah so they're
 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.050
like heavily salted yeah so they're
picking up this huge icebergs and you

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060
picking up this huge icebergs and you
 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.120
picking up this huge icebergs and you
can see like they are tons they're super

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130
can see like they are tons they're super
 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.499
can see like they are tons they're super
heavy they have our own vessel they're

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509
heavy they have our own vessel they're
 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.390
heavy they have our own vessel they're
picking up these icebergs and then

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400
picking up these icebergs and then
 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.010
picking up these icebergs and then
melting them down into this bottle so

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020
melting them down into this bottle so
 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.230
melting them down into this bottle so
that's something very cost intensive and

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240
that's something very cost intensive and
 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.840
that's something very cost intensive and
they're cost intensive and also it's not

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850
they're cost intensive and also it's not
 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.580
they're cost intensive and also it's not
gonna be that they're not gonna make

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590
gonna be that they're not gonna make
 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.370
gonna be that they're not gonna make
million now and I think they did 10,000

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380
million now and I think they did 10,000
 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.480
million now and I think they did 10,000
bottles faster so that's why the price

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490
bottles faster so that's why the price
 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.770
bottles faster so that's why the price
point is gonna be elevated it's

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780
point is gonna be elevated it's
 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.010
point is gonna be elevated it's
something very very unique that's a

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020
something very very unique that's a
 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.709
something very very unique that's a
fascinating so it's a very fun

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719
fascinating so it's a very fun
 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.830
fascinating so it's a very fun
interesting water to start your soup and

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840
interesting water to start your soup and
 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.490
interesting water to start your soup and
remember maybe oh my goodness and it's

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500
remember maybe oh my goodness and it's
 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.240
remember maybe oh my goodness and it's
gonna be as you mentioned a pretty low

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250
gonna be as you mentioned a pretty low
 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.820
gonna be as you mentioned a pretty low
yeah yeah but but it's still a distinct

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830
yeah yeah but but it's still a distinct
 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.370
yeah yeah but but it's still a distinct
flavor or no that's interesting putz so

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380
flavor or no that's interesting putz so
 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.080
flavor or no that's interesting putz so
I had three bottles already in tasting

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090
I had three bottles already in tasting
 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.490
I had three bottles already in tasting
in all three bottles tasted slightly

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500
in all three bottles tasted slightly
 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.320
in all three bottles tasted slightly
different and that makes sense because

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330
different and that makes sense because
 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.970
different and that makes sense because
it's a mother it's a product of nature

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980
it's a mother it's a product of nature
 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.820
it's a mother it's a product of nature
again and all these icebergs they're

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830
again and all these icebergs they're
 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.650
again and all these icebergs they're
floating into the sea so obviously all

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660
floating into the sea so obviously all
 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.540
floating into the sea so obviously all
these icebergs have a slightly different

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550
these icebergs have a slightly different
 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.970
these icebergs have a slightly different
flavor to it and the name again is small

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980
flavor to it and the name again is small
 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.250
flavor to it and the name again is small
bodies bodies are Reacher and Norway and

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260
bodies bodies are Reacher and Norway and
 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.960
bodies bodies are Reacher and Norway and
they calling that water swells of our

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970
they calling that water swells of our
 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.940
they calling that water swells of our
body so let's see what this version

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950
body so let's see what this version
 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:47.240
