is that there are current systems in

the planet interior was parallel to the

and we did that for all orbits as a

the magnetic equator this is longitude
 

00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:37.610
the magnetic equator this is longitude
on the horizontal axis and the answer is

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:37.620
on the horizontal axis and the answer is
 

00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:40.160
on the horizontal axis and the answer is
that the magnetic equator is offset from

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:40.170
that the magnetic equator is offset from
 

00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:43.330
that the magnetic equator is offset from
the geographic equator at all longitudes

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:43.340
the geographic equator at all longitudes

by about 500 kilometers on this plot or

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:47.610
by about 500 kilometers on this plot or
 

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:51.590
by about 500 kilometers on this plot or
this plot and this is a small planet

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:51.600
this plot and this is a small planet
 

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:53.360
this plot and this is a small planet
that's about twenty percent of the

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:53.370
that's about twenty percent of the
 

00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:55.490
that's about twenty percent of the
radius of the planet so this looks like

00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:55.500
radius of the planet so this looks like
 

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:58.070
radius of the planet so this looks like
the Earth's magnetic field but unlike

00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080
the Earth's magnetic field but unlike
 

00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:59.720
the Earth's magnetic field but unlike
the earth for the magnetic fields at the

00:30:59.720 --> 00:30:59.730
the earth for the magnetic fields at the
 

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:01.430
the earth for the magnetic fields at the
center of the planet this magnetic field

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440
center of the planet this magnetic field
 

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.530
center of the planet this magnetic field
is offset by twenty percent of the

00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:03.540
is offset by twenty percent of the
 

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:06.020
is offset by twenty percent of the
radius toward them North Pole so it

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:06.030
radius toward them North Pole so it
 

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:07.850
radius toward them North Pole so it
looks like the field of a bar magnet the

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:07.860
looks like the field of a bar magnet the
 

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:11.090
looks like the field of a bar magnet the

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:27.530
enough time but it's not at the center
of the planet it's offset and that means

00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:27.540
of the planet it's offset and that means
 

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:33.260
of the planet it's offset and that means
that the field is is a symmetric about

that the field is is a symmetric about

that the field is is a symmetric about

have magnetic anomalies there are places

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:45.570

where we cannot measure a magnetic

where we cannot measure a magnetic
 

00:34:47.669 --> 00:34:49.790
where we cannot measure a magnetic
anomaly but for the first time we are

00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:49.800
anomaly but for the first time we are
 

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.710

00:34:57.650 --> 00:34:57.660
impact flux was very high maybe four
 

00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:59.990
impact flux was very high maybe four
billion years ago and mercury has a

00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000
billion years ago and mercury has a
 

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.480
billion years ago and mercury has a
magnetic field and so we can conclude

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:02.490
magnetic field and so we can conclude
 

00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:05.420

several things we conclude that even

even given it's very low iron content it

even given it's very low iron content it
 

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:16.760
even given it's very low iron content it

has minerals that are capable of
 

00:35:16.770 --> 00:35:20.210
has minerals that are capable of
permanent magnetization and that

00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:20.220

magnetization was acquired encrusted as
 

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:24.920
magnetization was acquired encrusted as
much as four billion years old so it

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:24.930
much as four billion years old so it
 

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:28.340

changes our baseline for understanding

00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:28.350

surface then there's a question of what

00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:57.640
surface then there's a question of what
 

00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:00.059
surface then there's a question of what
are the polar deposits made out of so we

00:39:00.059 --> 00:39:00.069
are the polar deposits made out of so we
 

00:39:00.069 --> 00:39:03.299
are the polar deposits made out of so we
took a neutron spectrometer with us on

00:39:03.299 --> 00:39:03.309
took a neutron spectrometer with us on
 

00:39:03.309 --> 00:39:05.460

the spacecraft specifically to answer

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:05.470
the spacecraft specifically to answer
 

00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:07.950
the spacecraft specifically to answer
this question remember that the planet

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:07.960
this question remember that the planet
 

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:11.039
this question remember that the planet
is bathed in neutrons because they are

00:39:11.039 --> 00:39:11.049
is bathed in neutrons because they are
 

00:39:11.049 --> 00:39:13.470
is bathed in neutrons because they are
produced by cosmic rays but some

00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:13.480
produced by cosmic rays but some
 

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:16.109
produced by cosmic rays but some
neutrons are absorbed by materials at

00:39:16.109 --> 00:39:16.119
neutrons are absorbed by materials at
 

00:39:16.119 --> 00:39:18.140
neutrons are absorbed by materials at
the surface and the best absorber of

00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:18.150
the surface and the best absorber of
 

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:21.960
the surface and the best absorber of
neutrons over most energies is the

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:21.970
neutrons over most energies is the
 

00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:24.839
neutrons over most energies is the
hydrogen atom and so the neutron flux

00:39:24.839 --> 00:39:24.849
hydrogen atom and so the neutron flux
 

00:39:24.849 --> 00:39:27.420
hydrogen atom and so the neutron flux
has long been used as a tool to look for

00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:27.430
has long been used as a tool to look for
 

00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:30.930

model the story is complicated because

model the story is complicated because
 

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:56.490
model the story is complicated because
we have also measures of higher energy

the way to fit both kinds of data is to
 

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:25.410
the way to fit both kinds of data is to
say that the polar deposits are water

00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:25.420
say that the polar deposits are water
 

00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:27.900

00:54:58.720 --> 00:54:58.730
other planets and so the question is
 

00:54:58.730 --> 00:55:01.180
other planets and so the question is
whether there was a giant impact that

00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:01.190
whether there was a giant impact that
 

00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:04.930
whether there was a giant impact that
was responsible for some of that if the

00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:07.660

accretion of material are exploring
whether there are possibilities for

retaining enough of the volatile to

retaining enough of the volatile to
account for our measurement so I think

00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:28.550
account for our measurement so I think
 

00:55:28.550 --> 00:55:30.910
account for our measurement so I think
the jury's still out as to whether there

data so there are comets that have a

range of orbits and one can calculate
