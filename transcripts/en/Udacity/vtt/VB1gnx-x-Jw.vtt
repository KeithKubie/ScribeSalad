00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.700
So, this is the Doge version that Sarah can't stop playing. It's polite to

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.070
&gt;&gt; I need points.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.100
&gt;&gt; So, this is based on

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:07.800
&gt;&gt; Still scoring.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.860
&gt;&gt; The internet mean the Doge dog um,and this is just one

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.590
of you know, a ton of different modifications of this game that

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.580
is out here and you will have one yourself. How long do

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.500
you think it took the guys who made this to do this?

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.820
&gt;&gt; Honestly, for experienced programmers, probably like ten minutes. [LAUGH]

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:25.210
&gt;&gt; That's,

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.020
that's so cool. How long do you think it

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.680
will take our students to have their own version working?

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.970
&gt;&gt; Maybe a little more than ten minutes. Maybe like an hour. [LAUGH]

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.460
&gt;&gt; Okay,but to even just to make some little changes how long?

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.035
&gt;&gt; I could be doing that in minutes ,yeah.

00:00:38.035 --> 00:00:40.730
&gt;&gt; Okay,so literally, this stuff isn't that hard. That

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.400
was, what was the most mind blowing to me when

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.160
I started going over how this all works and you'll

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.909
have your own version in ten minutes, so keep watching.
