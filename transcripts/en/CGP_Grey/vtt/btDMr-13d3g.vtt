200,000 Subscribers.

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:02.750
Thank you.

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:03.750
Hi, YouTube.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:04.750
Well, that was fast.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.800
At the end of January, I made a video thanking
the first 100,000 subscribers for joining

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.380
my channel, and now, just three months later,
the subscribers have been doubled, which is

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.410
an unbelievable rate of growth, so thank you
so much to everyone who's joined up with me

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.450
on this little corner of the internet.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.590
These last three months have been a crazy,
busy time for me, with too many projects going

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.620
on at once, and the next three months will
probably be the same, with more videos and

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.250
other stuff on the way.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.199
One project that's finished now, thanks to
Hank Green, a man who himself runs so many

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.710
different things it's hard to keep track of
them all, is CGP grey shirt, which is now

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.929
available on the DFTBA store.

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:34.800
In case you're wondering, the proceeds of
the shirt will be used to purchase coffee,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.140
that coffee will fuel the typing and clicking
needed to manufacture videos, videos which

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.370
may contain links to buy the very shirt that
brought them into existence, thus completing

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.510
the circle of life.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.950
So, go grab one today if you'd like to support
the channel.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.280
It's been amazing making videos for you, while
watching the channel grow, though now releasing

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.039
each video to so many people is slightly intimidating.

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:54.670
Even though I take far, far too long researching
each one, I still spend the first few minutes

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.240
after uploading living in fear that I've made
some unintentional error and waiting for the

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.829
inevitable comment pointing out where I made
a typo, and there are always typos.

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.670
But, terror of errors aside, the nice thing
about having such a large community is being

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.390
able to share not only my own stuff with you,
but also other people's videos, either through

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.610
hidden links on my own, or in separate playlists,
like the one I made this week.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.200
Though, on these videos, I've noticed people
often leave comments like, Grey's army coming

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.890
through, and I'm not sure an army is the best
representation of who we are.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.610
I'm more a science and technology guy who
likes reason and simple things that turn complex

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.650
in interesting ways, and since you're here
watching these videos, I assume you are as

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:28.650
well.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.131
I'm not sure what the best collective noun
for this growing community is, but if you

00:01:31.131 --> 00:01:33.009
have any thoughts, I'd love to hear them.

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:34.780
Anyway, I'm getting off topic.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.440
You are the reason I can continue to make
these videos.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.310
Thank you for watching, and thank you for
subscribing.
