Some good examples of answers include,
Sensor Listeners, Location Updates,

00:00:04.502 --> 00:00:08.230
Dynamic Broadcast Receivers
or Games Physics Engines.

00:00:09.101 --> 00:00:11.799
Any task that your application 
needs to keep happening,

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:13.785
even when your activity is paused,

00:00:13.785 --> 00:00:16.250
shouldn't really happen 
within an activity at all.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.422
We'll have a look at some solutions 
to that problem in Lesson 6.

00:00:20.557 --> 00:00:24.001
Keep in mind that when you're activity
is paused, it's still visible.

00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:27.973
It's just obscured by something else,
usually a dialog box.

00:00:27.973 --> 00:00:29.788
But it's not stopped.

00:00:29.788 --> 00:00:33.280
So, don't stop drawing your UI 
when you receive onPause.
