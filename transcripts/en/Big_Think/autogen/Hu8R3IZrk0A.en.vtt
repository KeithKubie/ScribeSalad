00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.750
the center of gravity of the global

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760
the center of gravity of the global
 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.150
the center of gravity of the global
economy is actually shifting east and

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160
economy is actually shifting east and
 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.710
economy is actually shifting east and
south to some extent in fact what's

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720
south to some extent in fact what's
 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.810
south to some extent in fact what's
interesting about that is that if you

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820
interesting about that is that if you
 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.360
interesting about that is that if you
actually try to do a center of gravity

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:10.370
actually try to do a center of gravity
 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.680
actually try to do a center of gravity
analysis you'll actually find that the

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690
analysis you'll actually find that the
 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.660
analysis you'll actually find that the
the center of gravity of the global

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670
the center of gravity of the global
 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.240
the center of gravity of the global
economy by 2025 will actually be

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250
economy by 2025 will actually be
 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.490
economy by 2025 will actually be
somewhere in East Asia and what's

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500
somewhere in East Asia and what's
 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.630
somewhere in East Asia and what's
interesting about that is that that's

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640
interesting about that is that that's
 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.480
interesting about that is that that's
where it was in about year 1 AD as in

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490
where it was in about year 1 AD as in
 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.000
where it was in about year 1 AD as in
fact in some ways it's a return back to

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010
fact in some ways it's a return back to
 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.529
fact in some ways it's a return back to
where the center of gravity used to be

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539
where the center of gravity used to be
 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.679
where the center of gravity used to be
so you've got that big geographic shift

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689
so you've got that big geographic shift
 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.020
so you've got that big geographic shift
happening associated with that same

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030
happening associated with that same
 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.000
happening associated with that same
Geographic shift is actually another

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010
Geographic shift is actually another
 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.010
Geographic shift is actually another
shift which is in some ways even more

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020
shift which is in some ways even more
 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.500
shift which is in some ways even more
interesting which is the the rise in

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510
interesting which is the the rise in
 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.840
interesting which is the the rise in
importance of cities and urbanization I

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850
importance of cities and urbanization I
 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.280
importance of cities and urbanization I
think for the first time we're going to

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290
think for the first time we're going to
 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.290
think for the first time we're going to
see the majority of humanity live in

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300
see the majority of humanity live in
 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.049
see the majority of humanity live in
cities in the ways in ways that are way

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059
cities in the ways in ways that are way
 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.340
cities in the ways in ways that are way
more profound than we've ever seen

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350
more profound than we've ever seen
 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.470
more profound than we've ever seen
before in fact of you if you actually

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480
before in fact of you if you actually
 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.810
before in fact of you if you actually
look at the global economy through the

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820
look at the global economy through the
 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.790
look at the global economy through the
lens of cities you see a few different

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800
lens of cities you see a few different
 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.670
lens of cities you see a few different
things one you see that for example

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680
things one you see that for example
 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.869
things one you see that for example
right you know between now and the year

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879
right you know between now and the year
 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.979
right you know between now and the year
2025 something like two thirds of the

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989
2025 something like two thirds of the
 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.020
2025 something like two thirds of the
global economy and the growth in the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030
global economy and the growth in the
 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.460
global economy and the growth in the
global economy is going to be led by

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470
global economy is going to be led by
 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.219
global economy is going to be led by
about 600 cities and that's a very

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229
about 600 cities and that's a very
 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.010
about 600 cities and that's a very
finite number in 600 cities in the in

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020
finite number in 600 cities in the in
 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.450
finite number in 600 cities in the in
the grand scheme of things it's not a

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460
the grand scheme of things it's not a
 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.580
the grand scheme of things it's not a
very large number and of those 600

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590
very large number and of those 600
 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.730
very large number and of those 600
cities something like 440 of them are

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740
cities something like 440 of them are
 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.280
cities something like 440 of them are
actually in emerging countries most

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290
actually in emerging countries most
 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.020
actually in emerging countries most
people haven't heard of cities like ku

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030
people haven't heard of cities like ku
 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.700
people haven't heard of cities like ku
masu Tianjin Honshu so there's a lot of

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710
masu Tianjin Honshu so there's a lot of
 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.130
masu Tianjin Honshu so there's a lot of
cities on that list of in the global

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140
cities on that list of in the global
 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.560
cities on that list of in the global
economy that are quite extraordinary and

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570
economy that are quite extraordinary and
 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.050
economy that are quite extraordinary and
and by the way this rise in urbanization

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060
and by the way this rise in urbanization
 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.270
and by the way this rise in urbanization
is interesting because you know we've

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280
is interesting because you know we've
 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.130
is interesting because you know we've
actually been adding something the

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140
actually been adding something the
 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.859
actually been adding something the
equivalent of if you like six Chicago's

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869
equivalent of if you like six Chicago's
 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.990
equivalent of if you like six Chicago's
every year to the global economy in

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000
every year to the global economy in
 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.410
every year to the global economy in
terms of just the sheer scale of this

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420
terms of just the sheer scale of this
 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.109
terms of just the sheer scale of this
urbanization trend we know that people

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119
urbanization trend we know that people
 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.780
urbanization trend we know that people
are wealthier on average when they move

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790
are wealthier on average when they move
 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.550
are wealthier on average when they move
into cities we know that cities as

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560
into cities we know that cities as
 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.530
into cities we know that cities as
economic engines are actually more

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540
economic engines are actually more
 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.260
economic engines are actually more
productive because of that density we

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270
productive because of that density we
 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.270
productive because of that density we
also know now as a result also other

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280
also know now as a result also other
 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.700
also know now as a result also other
things like technology that some of the

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710
things like technology that some of the
 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.980
things like technology that some of the
most interesting innovations and

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990
most interesting innovations and
 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.900
most interesting innovations and
business models and models are actually

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910
business models and models are actually
 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.029
business models and models are actually
happening inside cities so it's no

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039
happening inside cities so it's no
 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.130
happening inside cities so it's no
surprise that the vast majority of some

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140
surprise that the vast majority of some
 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.670
surprise that the vast majority of some
of the

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680
of the
 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.229
of the
trends we're seeing whether it's you

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239
trends we're seeing whether it's you
 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.149
trends we're seeing whether it's you
know the ubers or the Airbnb s and all

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159
know the ubers or the Airbnb s and all
 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.860
know the ubers or the Airbnb s and all
these kinds of a new interesting models

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870
these kinds of a new interesting models
 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.770
these kinds of a new interesting models
all happen in dense urban environments

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780
all happen in dense urban environments
 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.660
all happen in dense urban environments
so cities are at a very interesting

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670
so cities are at a very interesting
 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.699
so cities are at a very interesting
place and I think we haven't thought

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709
place and I think we haven't thought
 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.589
place and I think we haven't thought
enough about them as sort of engines of

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599
enough about them as sort of engines of
 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.650
enough about them as sort of engines of
economic growth and performance
