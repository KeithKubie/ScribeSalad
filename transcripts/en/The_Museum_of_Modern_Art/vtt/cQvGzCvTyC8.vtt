00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:01.780
Welcome to Week 4.

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:03.290
This is Silhouettes.

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.160
It’s Coutures.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.060
[LAUGH]

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.540
We're going to be talking about coutures
this week, and that's coutures with an "s"

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.200
very specifically.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.740
And I'm going to ask our resident fashion,
historian, and expert to talk about why we're

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.040
talking about coutures, and with an "s".

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.540
Why is it plural?

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.720
What does even couture mean?

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.700
So many of us have probably heard the term
"couture" applied to different aspects of

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.700
fashion.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.090
It is a French word that translates into "dressmaking"
or "sewing."

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.940
And I'm sure some of us have heard it applied
to probably like an expensive piece of fashion,

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.269
something that was handmade, or even one of
a kind.

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:44.609
And all of those descriptors are in part true,
but the word "couture," as it applies to fashion,

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:49.109
really originates in the 19th century with
the establishment of the Chambre Syndicale

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:51.789
de la Haute Couture, meaning the couture syndicate.

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:56.949
It was essentially a governing body that was
established in order to protect designers

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:58.920
in France from piracy.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.989
It still exists today.

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.969
And in order to be considered couture, you
have to essentially abide by some very strict

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:08.270
regulations put forth by this body.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.640
Very extensive, but a few examples are you
have to have your atelier located in Paris,

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.680
every garment needs to be one of a kind and
made for a specific client and have multiple

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.969
fittings, and most of the garment needs to
be handmade.

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:25.950
So that's sort of the technical meaning of
couture.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.460
But, you know, the idea of couture, something
being handmade, exclusive, taking a lot of

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.009
craftsmanship can be applied to many, many
fashion items, including humble masterpieces,

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.460
which is why we have chosen to call this week
coutures with an "s", because we're going

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.840
to look at all of the different ways of making
fashion items from actual haute couture items

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.270
to more humble masterpieces.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.469
So as part of this week, we'll talk about
crafting.

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:56.740
And one of the things that we'll talk about,
and you'll actually get to see by going into

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.670
the studio, is how a bespoke suit is made.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.170
And so our team went to Anderson and Sheppard.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.560
It's a tailor in London.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.509
It's been on Savile Row, a place that really
is the heart of suit-making in London, and

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:09.509
actually really worldwide.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.010
It's globally known for its production of
suits.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.170
They've been there since the turn of the 20th
century.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.200
And you'll see the process, really from the
very, very first picking of the materials,

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.580
the measuring of somebody's body, very precisely
the measuring out.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.250
Then onto paper patterns and then onto fabric,
the cutting, the sewing, every single bit

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.760
of painstaking labor that goes into creating
a suit.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.220
We're then going to look at...

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.220
What's our next topic?

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.760
Stephanie: We're going to go from crafting
to what we're calling producing.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.581
So we're going to look at some examples that
perhaps at one point were made by hand, were

00:02:40.581 --> 00:02:48.450
made for one person, but due to their rising
popularity, have been made in more of a mass

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.900
assembly-line manner.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.700
And so a few examples that we're going to
look at are the clogs, the Aran sweater, and

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.680
then we're going to look at the leather biker
jacket.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.370
A lot of us look at the biker jacket and think
of it as the garment of the cool kid that

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.000
Marlon Brando so famously wore.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.680
But it's actually a wonderful example of a
garment that is made very intricately, but

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.730
on a bit of a larger scale than perhaps a
Panama hat or a suit for one client.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.100
Leather is not like a regular textile, like
polyester or cotton.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.840
So it really requires very highly trained
craftspeople, who also know how to work fairly

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.650
quickly in order to produce more than one
a day.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.160
So it's an interesting example of the transition
from crafting into producing.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.460
And then we'll also think about growing, actually
cultivating as a means to think about couture.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:46.060
So everything from cultivating pearls to thinking
about bio coutures, so the idea of being able

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.910
to grow from living cells to other types of
living organisms, and making that into something

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.810
that's a fashion garment or an accessory,
and then also thinking about growing through

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.000
3D and 4D printing.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.610
So additive processes like those, the design,
things like...

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.610
We have actually now a MoMA’s collection,
the Kinematics Dress.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.790
We hope you enjoyed this week, and perhaps
you'll look at your clothes a little differently

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:16.829
now that you know how they're made.
