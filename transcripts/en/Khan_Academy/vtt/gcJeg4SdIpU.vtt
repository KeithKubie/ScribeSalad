00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.770
We in the last video we took
the Macloren series of

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.840
representation of e to the x.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.650
Now let's do it with a couple
of other functions and we'll

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.880
see in a few videos it all fits
together like a giant puzzle.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.720
Let's do cosine of x.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:25.690
Let's set f of x, f of x
is equal to cosine of x.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.000
What's f prime of x?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.290
What's the first derivative
of cosine of x?

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.230
Well that just equals
minus sine of x.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.550
Minus sine of x.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.300
What's the second derivative?

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.410
Well that's just minus times
derivative of sine of x.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.170
So the derivative of sine
of x is cosine x, it's

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.590
minus cosine of x.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.980
And what's the
third derivative?

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.150
f 3 of x.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.500
The derivative of cosine x is
minus sine of x, we already

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.585
have a minus here so it
becomes positive sine of x.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.980
What's f 4 of x?

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.140
The fourth derivative of x?

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.430
It equals cosine of x again.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.110
As we keep taking derivatives
we'll keep repeating and the

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.540
pattern will go on, right?

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.460
The fifth derivative of x, the
fifth derivative of this

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.990
function, the fourth is the
same as a function, so the

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.010
fifth is going to be the same
as the first derivative.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.480
cosine of x is sine of x.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.230
Hopefully you see the pattern.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.950
We're going to do the Macloren
representation, which is a

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.600
specific example of the Taylor
series where we figure out the

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.100
values of the derivatives
at x is equal to zero.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.990
So let's do that right now.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.080
So f of zero, let me do
it in to another color

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.210
to fend off monotony.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.060
f of zero.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.720
What's cosine of zero?

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.410
Cosine of zero is 1.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.240
f prime of zero is equal to
sine of-- well not minus sine

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.780
of zero, but what sine of zero?

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.230
Sine of zero is zero,
so minus zero is still

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.850
zero, so this is zero.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.970
f prime prime of zero.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.630
Cosine of zero we
already know is one.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.310
We have a negative sine here,
so it becomes a minus one.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.440
The third derivative at
x is equal to zero.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.306
Sine of zero is zero.

00:02:19.306 --> 00:02:19.720
So this is zero.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.490
I think you might start to
see a pattern emerging.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.470
The fourth derivative at zero.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.840
Cosine of zero is equal to 1.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.390
And then the fifth derivative,
this is hard to read but you

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.170
get the point is
just zero again.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.930
So what's the pattern as
we take the derivatives?

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.710
1, zero, minus 1,
zero, 1, zero.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.550
So it alternates
between zero and 1.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.950
So 1, zero, minus 1, zero,
positive, zero, negative,

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.340
zero, positive.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.840
So every other number is zero
and in between them we

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.010
alternate between a positive
1 and a negative 1.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.500
So now let's use that
information to figure

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.720
out them the Macloren
series representation.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.160
So we proved, hopefully, we
didn't prove it definitely

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.370
converges over the entire
domain of the function.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.740
You have to take
my word for it.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.840
We'll experiment a little bit
with a graphing calculator

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.260
in a few videos.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.870
We said that this
representation-- and it should

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.690
make intuitive sense, because
when you take the infinite

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.720
Macloren series, when you take
that infinite sum, you're

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.510
essentially creating a function
where that function is equal to

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.240
your original function at
the point you chose.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.200
In the case of a Macloren we're
picking x equals zero, and it

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.270
equals every derivative
of this function.

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.090
Just intuitively it seems, well
if a function equals something

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.490
at a point and every one of its
derivatives is also equal to

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.070
the function at that point,
maybe those functions are

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.530
equal to each other.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.150
I haven't proven
that to you yet.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.800
We know that the representation
is a sum from n is equal to

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:04.330
zero to infinity of the nth
derivative evaluated at zero.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.790
A Macloren series is a specific
case of a Taylor series.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.760
We actually haven't done
anything with Taylor series, I

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.380
was hoping to get there later.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.980
But the Macloren series is a
really cool one because it's

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.770
going to show us all these
relationships between e and

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.990
cosine and sine and eventually
i and pi and you will

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:20.120
find it exciting.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:26.390
The Macloren is that times x
to the n over n factorial.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:27.630
That's what we said it was.

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.250
So if this is our f of x, f
of x is cosine of x, what

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.360
does this turn into?

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:45.256
Well, f of x is equal to, it
equals f of zero times x to

00:04:45.256 --> 00:04:48.610
the zero over zero factorial,
that's just one, right?

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.510
Plus, now we're at n equals 1.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.010
It's the first
derivative at zero.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.740
f prime of zero, well
that's just equal to zero.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.350
And who cares what that--
that would be x to the

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.230
first over 1, right?

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.480
Now we're at the
second derivative.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.970
The second derivative
at zero is minus 1.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:14.570
Minus 1 times x squared
over 2 factorial plus the

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.450
third derivative at zero.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.340
The third derivative at zero
we figured out was zero.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.590
Zero who cares what that is.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.890
It would have been x to the
third over 3 factorial.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.800
And then what's the
fourth derivative?

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:35.430
The fourth derivative at
zero is just equal to 1.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.200
So we have times 1 and then
we're at x to the fourth

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.570
over 4 factorial.

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.460
Let me see if I can write
this a little bit neater.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.370
The next one, the fifth
derivative at zero times x to

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.230
the fifth over 5 factorial.

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:50.230
We'll keep going.

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.980
Let me write this, clean this
up and hopefully the pattern

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.530
merges if it hasn't
emerged already.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:00.740
f of x is equal to cosine of x
is equal to-- let met get rid

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:06.850
of the zeros-- 1 and then we
have minus x squared

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:11.350
over 2 factorial.

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:12.860
This term, this goes away.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:13.800
This is a zero term.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.680
And the next one is a positive.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:21.330
Plus x to the fourth
over 4 factorial.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:22.620
And the fifth term goes away.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.600
But then the cycle continues.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.160
The next one is
going to be minus.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.000
Because we had minus 1 plus 1.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.380
It's going to be minus x to
the sixth over 6 factorial.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:32.420
You could take the
sixth derivative.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.070
You'll see that the derivative
of minus sine of x is minus

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.880
cosine of x, that's where
we get the minus 1 from.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.500
And they we're
going to go plus.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:45.160
So we're just taking all the
even terms. x to the eighth

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:53.460
over 8 factorial minus x to
the 10th over 10 factorial.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.360
We could just keep going
on and on and on.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:02.265
And so we have a situation
where we can rewrite cosine of

00:07:02.265 --> 00:07:10.260
x is equal to the sum, if you
believe that this Macloren

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:14.200
series actually does converge
to cosine of x over the entire

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.940
domain of x, that's kind of
an assumption we're making.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.790
Hopefully one day we will have
the tools set to actually

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.130
prove that as well.

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:26.300
From n is equal to zero.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.070
So what's happening?

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.600
We're taking all of
the even powers.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:38.160
So we could say x to the 2n,
that ensures that no matter

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.160
what value of n I put in
here I get an even numbers.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.620
So we'll go to the zeroth
power then the second

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:46.810
power, over 2n factorial.

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:50.360
So that takes care of going
from 1 to x squared over 2,

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.580
to x to the fourth over
4 factorial, 6 over 6

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:54.490
factorial, et cetera.

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:56.830
But now we have to make it
switched signs like that.

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:59.420
Well let's just multiply
it negative 1.

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:00.160
Let's see what we can do.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:07.160
Negative 1 to the-- so we want
the first term to be positive,

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.390
the second term to be negative.

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:15.300
So we could say times
minus 1 to the n plus 1.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.060
Let's see if that works.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:25.760
When m is zero what's
negative 1 to the n plus 1?

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.860
zero, it would be minus 1.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:39.870
And then when it's 1-- When
it's zero-- no, no it's just

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:42.890
going to be negative
1 to the n.

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:46.520
Because when it's zero,
negative 1 to zero is 1.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.555
When it's 1, negative 1.

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:53.350
So this will work out.

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:55.680
Negative 1 to the n is cosine.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.620
You could try it out.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.210
This is the n is equal to zero.

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:00.890
We need to switch colors.

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:04.310
That's n is equal to zero and
here we get x to the zero over

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:05.850
zero factorial, which is 1.

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:10.100
We have negative 1 to the zero
is 1, so that becomes 1.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:14.510
When n is equal to 1, this
becomes x squared over 2

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:17.920
factorial, we have negative 1
to the 1 power, so that's

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.270
where you get the negative 1.

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:22.850
And then when n is equal to
2, the negative 1 squared

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:23.830
becomes positive again.

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:26.220
So the negative 1 is
what provides the

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.160
alternating numbers.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.210
So pretty neat.

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:33.130
We just figured out another
way to represent cosine of x.

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:36.320
And it might be looking a
little bit interesting to you

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:43.490
that this representation kind
of resembles part of the

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:45.420
representation of e to the x.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.690
What's the difference between
this and the e to the x? e to

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:50.270
the x had the odd exponent
terms and it didn't

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:50.990
switch signs.

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:53.610
But other than that, they're
pretty much the same.

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:55.750
So in the next video we'll
do sine of x and then we'll

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:56.745
try to put it all together.

00:09:56.745 --> 00:09:58.600
I'll see you soon.
