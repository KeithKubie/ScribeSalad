speculation that the fruit that they're
 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.790
speculation that the fruit that they're
eating there you see it is psilocybin

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800
eating there you see it is psilocybin
 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.060

mushrooms because they're the only kind

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070
mushrooms because they're the only kind
 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.700
mushrooms because they're the only kind
of mushroom that grow like that so

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710
of mushroom that grow like that so
 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.750
of mushroom that grow like that so
that's pretty wild you might say and

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760
that's pretty wild you might say and
 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.640
that's pretty wild you might say and
then this is the I think it's called van

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650
then this is the I think it's called van
 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.800
then this is the I think it's called van
Asteria vine if I remember correctly and

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810
Asteria vine if I remember correctly and
 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.510
Asteria vine if I remember correctly and
it's what ayahuasca is made out of and

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520
it's what ayahuasca is made out of and
 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.340
it's what ayahuasca is made out of and
it has this double helix form which is

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350
it has this double helix form which is
 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.130
it has this double helix form which is
very very interesting and they the

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140
very very interesting and they the
 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.569
very very interesting and they the
people the natives nobody could figure

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579
people the natives nobody could figure
 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.680
people the natives nobody could figure
out how the hell they made this

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690
out how the hell they made this
 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.369
out how the hell they made this
ayahuasca which which transports people

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379
ayahuasca which which transports people
 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:45.139
ayahuasca which which transports people
spiritually in a very intense manner and

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149
spiritually in a very intense manner and
 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.430
spiritually in a very intense manner and
there's a whole religion based on it

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440
there's a whole religion based on it
 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.590
there's a whole religion based on it
like a modern religion as well as the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600
like a modern religion as well as the
 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.229
like a modern religion as well as the
archaic religion and to make this stuff

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239
archaic religion and to make this stuff
 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.729
archaic religion and to make this stuff
they had to take two plants that don't

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739
they had to take two plants that don't
 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.160
they had to take two plants that don't
grow anywhere near each other and like

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170
grow anywhere near each other and like
 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.750
grow anywhere near each other and like
there's like a million plants in the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760
there's like a million plants in the
 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.400
there's like a million plants in the
Amazon so like how do you figure that

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410
Amazon so like how do you figure that
 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.139
Amazon so like how do you figure that
out nobody knows and then you have to

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149
out nobody knows and then you have to
 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.119
out nobody knows and then you have to
cook them in this very particular way

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129
cook them in this very particular way
 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.939
cook them in this very particular way
for a particular amount of time before

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949
for a particular amount of time before
 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.380
for a particular amount of time before
you produce this stuff so one of the

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390
you produce this stuff so one of the
 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.359
you produce this stuff so one of the
plants has DMT in it which is a very

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369
plants has DMT in it which is a very
 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.039
plants has DMT in it which is a very
intense psychedelic but it's very short

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049
intense psychedelic but it's very short
 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.920
intense psychedelic but it's very short
acting and the other has an MAO

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930
acting and the other has an MAO
 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.260
acting and the other has an MAO
inhibitor so if you take the DMT and you

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270
inhibitor so if you take the DMT and you
 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.810
inhibitor so if you take the DMT and you
take the MAO inhibitor then the DMT trip

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820
take the MAO inhibitor then the DMT trip
 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.850
take the MAO inhibitor then the DMT trip
lasts for much longer and so that's what

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860
lasts for much longer and so that's what
 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.830
lasts for much longer and so that's what
these Amazonian natives figured out and

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840
these Amazonian natives figured out and
 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.510
these Amazonian natives figured out and
no one has any idea how they managed it

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520
no one has any idea how they managed it
 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.520
no one has any idea how they managed it
and if you ask them they tell you that

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530
and if you ask them they tell you that
 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.350
and if you ask them they tell you that
the plants told them how to do it which

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360
the plants told them how to do it which
 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.330
the plants told them how to do it which
isn't much of an explanation as far as

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340
isn't much of an explanation as far as
 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.429
isn't much of an explanation as far as
modern people are concerned but then

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439
modern people are concerned but then
 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.140
modern people are concerned but then
when modern people take the ayahuasca

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150
when modern people take the ayahuasca
 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.560
when modern people take the ayahuasca
and the plant so to speak starts to talk

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570
and the plant so to speak starts to talk
 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.569
and the plant so to speak starts to talk
to them they're a little less leery of

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579
to them they're a little less leery of
 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.069
to them they're a little less leery of
the whole theory that the plants had

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079
the whole theory that the plants had
 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.350
the whole theory that the plants had
something to do with this so you know

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360
something to do with this so you know
 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.200
something to do with this so you know
and these things that these I'm loathe

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210
and these things that these I'm loathe
 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.910
and these things that these I'm loathe
to talk about this because I'm not an

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920
to talk about this because I'm not an
 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.340
to talk about this because I'm not an
advocate for drug use but by the same

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350
advocate for drug use but by the same
 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.380
advocate for drug use but by the same
token you can't ignore empirical data

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390
token you can't ignore empirical data
 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.620
token you can't ignore empirical data
it's not reasonable and the empirical

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630
it's not reasonable and the empirical
 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.539
it's not reasonable and the empirical
data that psychedelic substances can

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549
data that psychedelic substances can
 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.340
data that psychedelic substances can
produce mystical experiences and that

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350
produce mystical experiences and that
 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.020
produce mystical experiences and that
those often have a transformative effect

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030
those often have a transformative effect
 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.910
those often have a transformative effect
I mean one of the latest studies showed

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920
I mean one of the latest studies showed
 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.859
I mean one of the latest studies showed
that if you took people who are dying of

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869
that if you took people who are dying of
 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.020
that if you took people who are dying of
cancer and you and you gave them

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030
cancer and you and you gave them
 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.119
cancer and you and you gave them
psilocybin in a sufficient dose to

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129
psilocybin in a sufficient dose to
 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.830
psilocybin in a sufficient dose to
produce a mystical experience that you

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840
produce a mystical experience that you
 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.050
produce a mystical experience that you
radically it decreased their their fear

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060
radically it decreased their their fear
 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.199
radically it decreased their their fear
of death it's like

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209
of death it's like
 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.369
of death it's like
you're going to think about that man

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379
you're going to think about that man
 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.009
you're going to think about that man
that's that's tough that's a tough

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019
that's that's tough that's a tough
 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.229
that's that's tough that's a tough
experiment you you just wouldn't expect

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239
experiment you you just wouldn't expect
 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.179
experiment you you just wouldn't expect
that that you think you take someone

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:23.189
that that you think you take someone
 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:26.539
that that you think you take someone
you'd arranged them intensely and then

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549
you'd arranged them intensely and then
 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.039
you'd arranged them intensely and then
when they come back they're not even

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049
when they come back they're not even
 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:29.149
when they come back they're not even
though they're dying they're not nearly

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159
though they're dying they're not nearly
 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:31.699
though they're dying they're not nearly
as afraid of dying you know you got to

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709
as afraid of dying you know you got to
 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.470
as afraid of dying you know you got to
kind of wake up and smell the roses when

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480
kind of wake up and smell the roses when
 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.849
kind of wake up and smell the roses when
you see something like that and the

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:34.859
you see something like that and the
 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:36.110
you see something like that and the
people who are doing this research are

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120
people who are doing this research are
 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.250
people who are doing this research are
very reliable people so there's the

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260
very reliable people so there's the
 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.679
very reliable people so there's the
Amanita muscaria you know there's this

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:42.689
Amanita muscaria you know there's this
 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:44.390
Amanita muscaria you know there's this
old idea it's quite a funny idea

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400
old idea it's quite a funny idea
 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.089
old idea it's quite a funny idea
toadstools so flies like Amanita

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099
toadstools so flies like Amanita
 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.030
toadstools so flies like Amanita
muscaria and there's some this is

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040
muscaria and there's some this is
 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.220
muscaria and there's some this is
ridiculous there's some evidence that

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230
ridiculous there's some evidence that
 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.039
ridiculous there's some evidence that
they actually like getting stoned

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049
they actually like getting stoned
 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.539
they actually like getting stoned
so because animals will eat these like

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549
so because animals will eat these like
 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.190
so because animals will eat these like
reindeer will eat these things too and

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200
reindeer will eat these things too and
 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.929
reindeer will eat these things too and
they get pretty tripped out by them and

00:02:59.929 --> 00:02:59.939
they get pretty tripped out by them and
 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:02.270
they get pretty tripped out by them and
so I have this book on psychedelic use

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280
so I have this book on psychedelic use
 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.699
so I have this book on psychedelic use
among animals which is a small book but

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709
among animals which is a small book but
 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.289
among animals which is a small book but
and so so there's there's this idea that

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299
and so so there's there's this idea that
 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.720
and so so there's there's this idea that
toads used to sit around the they have

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730
toads used to sit around the they have
 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.429
toads used to sit around the they have
any NamUs carry and wait for the stone

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:13.439
any NamUs carry and wait for the stone
 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:16.369
any NamUs carry and wait for the stone
flies to like buzz badly around them and

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379
flies to like buzz badly around them and
 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:18.830
flies to like buzz badly around them and
then snap them up so that's pretty funny

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840
then snap them up so that's pretty funny
 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.670
then snap them up so that's pretty funny
I think and so and you know there are

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680
I think and so and you know there are
 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.770
I think and so and you know there are
mushrooms in in the US that are the
