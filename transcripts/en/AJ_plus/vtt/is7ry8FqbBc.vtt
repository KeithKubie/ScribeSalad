00:00:05.072 --> 00:00:09.076
After more than 35 years, China is ending its one-child policy.

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:12.679
Now families will be able to have two children, but no more.

00:00:13,413 --&gt; 00:00:13,347
Why?

00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:17.017
Because the population is aging and its workforce is shrinking.

00:00:17.451 --> 00:00:20.721
That's an imbalance that will hurt China's economy for years to come.

00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:23.190
To curb a population that was spiraling out of control,

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.728
China's government embarked on its radical policy of one child per family in 1978.

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:32.599
While China still has the world's biggest population (of 1.3 billion),

00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:36.870
the policy is estimated to have prevented 400 million in additional births.

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:40.941
But the regulations did much more than just reduce China's numbers.

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:44.344
The government cracked down on people who had more than one child with fines,

00:00:45.012 --> 00:00:47.247
forced abortions and even sterilization.

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:50.184
It also had huge effects on the country's culture.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.587
"It’s not just forced abortions, it's not just sterilizations.

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:58.792
It’s questions like, well, who am I going to marry, who can I date?

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:04.965
What kind of home can I afford to buy? And how am I going to age gracefully?"

00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:08.569
Traditionally, boys were favored over girls in China,

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:11.605
as it was believed only a son could continue a family's legacy.

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:14.808
And in rural areas, boys were viewed as better laborers.

00:01:15.142 --> 00:01:18.111
So some families gave their girls up for international adoption,

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:21.281
while others took more drastic measures like infanticide.

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:25.052
"The population is so lopsided, for example, that in terms of dating

00:01:25.853 --> 00:01:27.054
you have 30 million more men then women

00:01:28.155 --> 00:01:31.625
and you also have a large population of only-child singletons,

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:36.129
so parents are very invested in their children’s dating choices."

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:40.000
Now the government needs people to have more babies and have them fast.

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:42.603
But it might not happen as quickly as hoped.

00:01:43.237 --> 00:01:46.173
Two years ago, the government started relaxing the rules,

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.611
allowing couples a second child if one of the parents was themself a single child.

00:01:51.178 --> 00:01:54.047
But many couples who qualified didn't even take advantage of it.

00:01:54.515 --> 00:01:56.550
The financial burdens that young Chinese families face

00:01:57.017 --> 00:01:59.186
makes having a second child a difficult choice,

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.589
especially if they have two sets of parents to take care of too.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.527
And at this point a one-child family has become the cultural ideal.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.662
"This mindset has become so ingrained,

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:13.467
I have plenty of friends who would not even consider having a second child."

00:02:13.734 --> 00:02:19.006
"Maybe when our economic condition turns better, we will plan to have another."

00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:21.875
"One is enough. I want to take good care of him.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.114
Raising a child is hard for us and our parents."

00:02:29.783 --> 00:02:31.518
So it seems China is in a bind.

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.154
After decades of telling families to do things one way,

00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:36.490
it wants them to suddenly start doing it another.

00:02:36.924 --> 00:02:40.527
Until schooling, housing and healthcare start becoming more affordable,

00:02:40.794 --> 00:02:44.565
many families might stick with the one-child policy long after it's gone.
