00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.860
Alright, so we've talked about how proper scales

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.000
can help present data more effectively, but why don't

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.840
we look at an example where scales are not

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.810
used well? When used incorrectly, scales can misguide or

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.260
confuse readers. This visualization from New South Wales shows

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.070
that the NSW health system is recruiting more nurses.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.880
But, I can tell you it's not a good

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.250
visualization. Can you tell why? Enter your answer in

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.150
