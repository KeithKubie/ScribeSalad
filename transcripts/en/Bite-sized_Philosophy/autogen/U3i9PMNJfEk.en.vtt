are you going to do about that run
 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.729
are you going to do about that run
that's not going to help you know if you

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739

the doors multiply and they get bigger

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100
the doors multiply and they get bigger
 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.610
the doors multiply and they get bigger
and you get smaller as you run like

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620
and you get smaller as you run like
 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.280

that's not a good that is not a good

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290
that's not a good that is not a good
 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.620
that's not a good that is not a good
solution and people do that in their

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630
solution and people do that in their
 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.979
solution and people do that in their
life all the time and so the dwarves get

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989
life all the time and so the dwarves get
 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.690
life all the time and so the dwarves get
bigger until they're giants and they get

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700
bigger until they're giants and they get
 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.550
bigger until they're giants and they get
smaller until there's nothing left of

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560
smaller until there's nothing left of
 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.050
smaller until there's nothing left of
them and then then there's no recovery

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060
them and then then there's no recovery
 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.290
them and then then there's no recovery
that is not good
