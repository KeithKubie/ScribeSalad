What Causes Hiccups

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:06.620
In medical terms, a hiccup can be called a
hiccough, a synchronous diaphragmatic flutter,

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:07.980
or singlutus.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.930
Hiccups are classified into three categories:
normal, protracted or persistent, and intractable.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.480
Protracted are those hiccups that last over
48 hours, but not more than one month.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.640
Intractable hiccups continue for more than
one month.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.400
If hiccups occur for less than 48 hours, they
are considered ‘normal’.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.460
In regards to the function of hiccuping, it
was once thought that this act was just a

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.289
twitch of the diaphragm (the muscle that separates
the thorax from the abdominal cavity and is

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:34.400
the main muscle involved in breathing).

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.180
It has since been shown to be a much more
complex process.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.860
It starts with a sudden, strong contraction
of all muscles involved in inspiration.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.899
This is followed almost immediately by the
glottis, or vocal cords, closing shut.

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.920
This clamping of the chords is what causes
the infamous ‘hic’ sound.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.240
The top of the mouth and back of the tongue
then move up, making an occasional associated

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.629
burp, as the diaphragm then contracts forcefully.

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:01.649
The heart will also tend to slow down during
this process.

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.579
This is thought to be caused by the stimulation
of the Vagus nerve, which slows a person’s

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:06.579
heart rate.

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:10.930
Precisely what causes this complex involuntary
reflex action is still up for debate, though

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.439
it is known that there are some common mediators
that trigger the reflexes.

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:19.619
Common causes are things like: eating excess
amounts of food; eating spicy foods; sudden

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.789
changes in stomach temperature, such as can
happen when eating something hot and washing

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:29.340
it down with an icy drink; consuming large
amounts of alcohol; exhaustion; or malnutrition.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.420
Some medical conditions are also thought to
cause hiccups, usually hiccups of the persistent

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.259
or intractable variety.

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:40.390
The most common that also triggers normal
hiccups is stomach acid moving into the esophagus.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.259
Neurological lesions involving the brain-stem,
metabolic disorders, irritation of the Phrenic

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.450
nerve (the one that goes to the diaphragm)
are also known to cause hiccups.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.479
Other known medical causes of hiccups include:
hyperglycemia, anorexia, meningitis, encephalitis,

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.170
heart attack, stroke, multiple sclerosis,
blows resulting in brain damage, electrolyte

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.489
imbalance, kidney failure, certain types of
infections… the list goes on and on.

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:09.899
What exactly is going on in the body to trigger
hiccups from these varied causes is heavily

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.790
debated among researchers who study hiccups,
but the general consensus is that there must

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.069
be some built in system involved in triggering
hiccups, a “central pattern generator”.

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.599
Specifically, it is thought that there is
a central neuronal circuit that generates

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.000
hiccups, similar to the ones that allow us
to cough, breath, and walk.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.780
Given the wide ranging conditions that can
cause hiccups and that the hiccups vary greatly

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.060
in duration based on a variety of factors,
this circuit must be conditional, only triggering

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.180
when certain conditions within the body are
met.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.320
Hiccups themselves are thought to offer no
biological benefit to humans.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.840
Further, the hiccup is commonly seen and heard
from fetuses on ultra sound, and occurs well

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.959
before any type of breathing movement in-utero.

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.640
It’s because of this that Dr. William A
Whitelaw, a professor at the University of

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.250
Calgary, has suggested the central circuit
involved is left over from a previous stage

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.720
of human evolution.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.239
As evidence, he suggests looking to other
animals in nature that have hiccup-like actions

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.239
in their species.

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.409
For instance, he points to a tadpole that
breaths air through both lungs and gills.

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:14.640
While breathing air through the gills, a tadpole
will take in water and close its glottis at

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.709
the same time, allowing the water to be forced
out through the gills and not into the lungs.

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.370
This is a similar action as hiccups in humans.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.080
While there is no known definitive cure for
hiccups, any online search will yield countless

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.200
suggestions and home remedies.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.200
The University of Maryland’s Children’s
Hospital gives the following suggestions.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.249
First, try breathing into a paper bag for
10 seconds.

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:40.480
This will raise the carbon dioxide levels
in your blood, which can help stop the hiccup.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.100
Having someone scare or startle you, tickle
you, or taking a spoonful of sugar also has

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.630
been shown to occasionally cure hiccups.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.060
Another method is to hold a very deep breath
as long as you can.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.959
This will also cause blood carbon dioxide
levels to rise.

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.659
However, the deeper the breath you take, the
better it seems to work, so it may not just

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:00.260
be about raising carbon dioxide levels.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.480
Bonus Facts:
• The world record for longest bout of hiccups

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.290
is held by Charles Osborne from Iowa.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.870
He had the hiccups from 1922-1990.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.910
That’s 68 straight years of hiccups.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.430
Oddly, they randomly stopped about a year
before he died.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.239
• The Old English word for hiccup “ælfsogoða”
derives from the fact that it was thought

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.410
hiccups were caused by elves.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:28.590
• In 2007 a Florida girl (Jennifer Mee)
had a bout of uncontrollable hiccups at a

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.099
rate of about 50 times per minute that lasted
for approximately 5 weeks before stopping

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:34.099
on their own.

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:39.039
Later on she suffered periodic bouts, and
exhaustively sought an explanation from Doctors,

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:40.190
without success.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.370
It was her lawyer, in 2010, who claimed that
they are a symptom of her other known medical

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.300
condition, Tourette’s syndrome.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.099
Why her lawyer do you ask?

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:54.120
Because in October of 2010, Mee and accomplices
Laron Raiford and Lamont Newton were arrested

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.110
and charged with the 1st degree murder of
22 year old Shannon Griffin.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.379
The three allegedly lured Griffin to a vacant
house where they robbed him and shot him several

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:03.379
times.

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:06.349
Mee’s lawyer claims her Tourette’s may
have played a role in the robbery.

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:12.020
As evidence of her diagnosis, he points to
her frequent hiccuping episodes.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.710
• Another dramatic case of the hiccups occurred
in 2006 with a man named Christopher Sands

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.220
who lived in Lincolnshire, England.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.310
Sands’ hiccups lasted around 3 years and
robbed him of his career as a musician and

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.310
vocalist.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.960
His hiccups were so bad at times that he would
be unable to breathe properly and would occasionally

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.039
pass out from it.

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:31.590
He also had significant difficulty in sleeping.

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:37.340
Sands eventually received media attention
in 2009 and doctors in the United States investigated

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.660
and found he had a tumor in his brain stem
that was causing the hiccups.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:55.539
After removing it, the hiccups went away.
