00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.780
 Your brain is two separate brains. 

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.340
 Two halves, each half doing half the work that is to be you. 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.980
 Each half sees half of what you see and controls half of your movement 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.120
 The right holds left 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.120
 The left controls the right. 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.500
 The hemispheres of your brain are coordinated through a wire of nerves, however 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:20.120
 This wire can be cut off, and this has been used for a while in the treatment of epilepsy. 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.920
 After cutting the wire, people seemed to be the same, although the brain was divided into two parts. 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.680
 Except that some of them had chosen their clothes in the morning 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.659
 With the right hand, the left hand comes to object. 

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:38.220
 In fact, the left hand often objects, from what affected these patients frustrated. 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.260
 what happens? 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.180
 To understand this, remember, see the right brain and control one half, while 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.560
 He sees the left brain and controls the other half. 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.560
 But only the left brain can speak. 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.320
 "Hi." 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.120
 Because the center of speech is located. 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.339
 While the right brain can not speak 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.640
 In normal brains, this is not important because each half communicates with the other through the wire. 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.600
 But, the separated brains can not, so, you can show the word of the right brain, and ask the person: 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.190
 "What I saw?", 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.500
 It will respond with nothing. 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.940
 Because the left brain, which speaks, has not seen anything !. 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.440
 At the same time, the right brain will use the left hand to select something hidden from the left brain. 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.520
 This is really weird !. 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.679
 Ask the person "why did you stick to this thing?" The left brain that speaks will have to 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.800
 With a reasonable explanation, but completely wrong,. 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.000
 "I've always wanted to learn how to solve this." 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.500
 The left brain does not lie. He just does what the brains always do 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.980
 Creating stories that explain his past actions to himself at present, a behavior that casts doubt on 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.100
 On the idea of ​​free will (a long story). 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.940
 Creating reasons to explain his actions is just something 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:41.960
 Do the left brain. 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.220
 It happens in normal, in all normal and healthy humans all the time, and if you think about it closely, you 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.160
 You know you have done so much. 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.100
 Now go back to the experiments. 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.200
 Give the right brain something, and ask the person, "What's in your hand?" He will not be able to answer. 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.940
 "I do not hold anything." 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.320
 When asked to draw, the separated brain can draw two separate objects 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.119
 At one time, with each hand, the way you find the healthy tough. 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.640
 These experiments on patients separated by their brains are highly confused 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.820
 Because it really indicates the possibility of a separate silent intelligence ... 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:13.940
 Thing... 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.500
 Stranger lives in the skull. 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.940
 You can get different answers for the same questions 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.799
 So, if your brain is broken, who in this case would you be? 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.220
 From the outside, it is tempting to think that it is the part of the brain that speaks as you are, however 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.940
 There is something else that hears and answers questions. 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.500
 Although the right brain can not speak, it understands the faces, unlike the left brain. 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.300
 If the left brain is you, you will not know your friends and family amidst a crowd. 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.400
 Divide the brain into two halves leaving two minds in one head, and the mind that speaks 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.239
 Do not know that there is someone else in the house. 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.600
 The left brain can describe the situation in it, but nevertheless it will always be surprised 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.000
 Of the right brain actions and their interpretation. 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.180
 There is a question to ask here: 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.480
 Why the right brain is not frightened after its separation, but instead helps the left brain 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.579
 Answers questions, and listens to left brain stories about what is happening. 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.640
 - Is this the best horse ... I do not know. 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:15.780
 - Time speculation ... 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:23.400
 One answer is that brain division does not make the right brain separate from ... intelligence ... consciousness! ... the person!? 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:30.480
 It is always so. The fact is that in ordinary people the right brain grows to act as a companion without a choice. 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.739
 He initially felt his partnership with the left brain but after the evolution of speech to that 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.900
 Speech becomes increasingly a central point in life, the right brain silently quits until it coordinates with the left brain. 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.900
 At this moment, in your head, there are two of you watching this video: 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:52.600
 One has a "mind at a moment amazed", and the other mind drives the vision to make sure everything is clear. 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.140
 In divided brains, the right brain does not lose its senses because change is not great for it 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.140
 May not agree with this, and may now argue about why this can not be possible, just as expected 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.880
 Of the left brain to do. 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:12.620
 Assumptions On the other hand, divided patients show their brains, at least, in the brain there is something separate ... 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.100
 Something that can be heard, understood and responded, when exposed to certain circumstances 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.160
 Your brain is not fully yours !. 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.480
 who are you? 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.120
 You two. 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.980
 But we can go deeper. You are so much. 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:34.400
 You are a pile of flesh that is your body and that consists of trillions of cells that have their own lives !. 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.640
 So, when any point becomes a lot one? 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.680
 What makes a lot of small things you? 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.460
 Click here to go to our channels and watch the next part. 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.540
 Hardly, if you hear the channel "Kurtzat" many things miss you. 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.320
 Kurgaset? 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.680
 Kurtzgaset? 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.000
