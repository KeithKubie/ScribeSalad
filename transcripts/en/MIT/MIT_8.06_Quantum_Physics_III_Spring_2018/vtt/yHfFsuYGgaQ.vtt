00:00:00.527 --> 00:00:01.110
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.620
So what is our
Schrodinger equation?

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.180
Therefore, our
Schrodinger equation

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:16.096
is ih bar d psi dt is
equal to 1 over 2 m.

00:00:16.096 --> 00:00:18.460
H bar over i grad--

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:30.070
that's p-- minus q over c a
squared plus q phi on psi.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.970
We're going to motivate
that next time.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.790
But let's look at it for
a little while, at least.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.540
There's several things
we've done here.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:54.716
We've replaced p by
p minus q over c a.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.160
So this is a replacement.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.020
P has been replaced by that.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.420
We used to have p
squared over 2m.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.010
Now we have this quantity.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.580
Well, we'll see why that
is the right thing to do,

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:23.270
but you could ask
yourself, is this p still

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.930
intuitively equal to mv or not?

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.020
And the answer is no.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.800
That's not really mv.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.240
We will see that from
Heisenberg's equation

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.380
of motion, but intuitively,
when you have here--

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.200
this is the energy
of a particle--

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.750
kinetic energy and
potential energy--

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.390
the kinetic energy--

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:57.590
1 over 2m times m
squared v squared.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.700
That's p squared.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.640
So 1 over 2m m squared v
squared is 1/2 mv squared.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.050
That's the kinetic energy.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.220
And that should come from here.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.979
So what we will
see is that, if you

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.910
want to speak about
the velocity operator,

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.090
this whole thing is
the velocity operator.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.350
We don't speak, really, of
velocity operators in quantum

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.660
mechanics before we put
electromagnetic fields,

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.420
but here, it will be natural to
call this m times the velocity

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.660
operator in the sense of
Heisenberg equations of motion.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.850
This operator is Heisenberg
equation of motion--

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.930
is going to look like the
Lorenz force equation.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.130
So it will be reasonable
to think of this like that.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:54.220
This operator is nicer than
the operator p, as we will see,

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.135
for many reasons.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:04.690
So we've emphasized gauging
variance so that, perhaps,

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.910
the most important
thing we could say, now,

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.610
to end up this
lecture is, what is

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.835
the statement of gauge
invariance for this Schrodinger

00:03:13.835 --> 00:03:14.335
equation?

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.010
So gauge invariance
means that the physics

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.570
that you obtain with
one set of potentials

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.510
should be the same
as the physics you

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.590
obtain with a gauge-equivalent
set of potentials.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.780
So I will say this way--

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:52.020
suppose you solve the
Schrodinger equation

00:03:52.020 --> 00:04:00.130
with h bar over i
grad minus q over c,

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.160
with the new potentials--

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:20.010
plus q-- or you solve
the Schrodinger equation

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.638
with the old potentials?

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.310
So you have here
the two Schrodinger

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.430
equations-- one with
the new potentials, one

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.990
with the old potentials.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.530
They should be the
same physical solution.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:54.610
This is not going to be too
obvious how to do, however.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.220
How do I guarantee they are
the same physical solution?

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.550
I'll have to go on a
limb and try something.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:04.330
Look.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.310
Here are the gauge
transformation.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.590
That's what a prime is.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.495
That's what phi prime is.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:20.880
Should the same psi
be a solution of both?

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.450
Should this equation
imply this equation,

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.830
so that the same psi works
when you change the gauge

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.930
potentials?

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.380
That would not work.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.390
That is asking too much.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:43.460
Certainly, the same psi worked
would be simple looking,

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:51.210
but that's not what you
really have to demand.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.020
It's not going to be
able to occur here.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.310
What you're going to need
is to change psi as well.

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.850
The gauge transformation
is going to affect the wave

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.740
function, too.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.330
Not only the electromagnetic
fields get gauge transform--

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.630
the wave function must
be gauge transform.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.290
And you would say, OK.

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.880
That sounds a little dangerous
because if you change the wave

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.610
function, you're going
to change the physics.

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:20.940
Could happen.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.880
But the change in
the wave function

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.380
is going to be subtle enough--

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.850
is going to be just by a phase.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.950
That can still
change the physics.

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.860
If you have a complex phase,
you can change the physics.

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.730
But will be simple
enough that we

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.290
will check that the
physics is not changed.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:44.270
So the claim of gauge
invariance is a statement

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:50.390
that this equation implies
this, or this implies that,

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:57.140
if psi prime also transforms.

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.380
And the formula
is-- at psi prime--

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:09.095
should be equal to e to the
i q over hc lambda times psi.

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:22.090
So that's the key to it.

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:24.910
When you transform
the potentials--

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:28.390
when you change a to a
prime and phi to phi prime--

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:30.720
you should change
psi to psi prime.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.220
What?

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:32.080
With what?

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.500
Using the same lambda
that you needed

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:41.170
to change the potentials,
you do a phase rotation.

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:43.030
And it's not a constant phase.

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:45.460
This depends on x and t.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.680
So it's a substantial change.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.610
So you now have the technical
problem of first checking

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.040
that this is true.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.580
This is the statement of gauge
invariance of the Schrodinger

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:58.450
equation.

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:01.780
There is a way to
transform the wave function

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:05.320
so that the new
Schrodinger equation

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.350
solution is obtained from
the old Schrodinger equation

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:08.990
solution.

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:12.580
And then we will have to check
that the physics is the same.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.100
If you wanted to
compute the expectation

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:20.420
value of x, on
this wave function,

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:21.980
this phase factor would cancel.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.320
So it would give you the same.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.550
If you want to compute some
other expectation values,

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:27.840
it's a little funny.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:32.180
So there will be operators that
are nice for wave functions

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:34.760
or [INAUDIBLE] gauge
invariant operators.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:39.630
And it will be a nice story
that we will develop next time.
