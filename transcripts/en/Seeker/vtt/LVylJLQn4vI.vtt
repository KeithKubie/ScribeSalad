If you ask a hipster, the word hipster has pretty much lost all meaning,

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:05.460
but if you ask someone else,

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.460
it means a hipster and everybody gets it.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.040
[INTRO MUSIC]

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.600
Hey there friends!

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.360
Grab your fancy coffees. I'm Trace.
Thanks for watching DNews.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.940
Slide into those skinny jeans, grab the deepest-v you got and hop on your fixie,

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.680
because we're going where everyone
seems to go: down hipster lane.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.880
Hipsters are difficult to describe as a group, but we know one when we see one, right?

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.120
And a new mathematical neuroscience paper explains why that is.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.700
"The hipster effect: When anticonformists all look the same,"

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.400
focuses specifically on French hipsters. Their results found that hipsters, they can't even hipster.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.340
Seriously! According to their math, which
looks like this, hipsters are too slow to change

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:54.220
and the reason all hipsters look alike, is because they are all part of the mainstream pretty much right away.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.380
The paper says because the hipsters are too
slow to react to new trends, they continue

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:05.169
to make the same choices -- a la wearing a beard, dark-rim glasses, plaid -- which maintains a correlation

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:08.619
to each other and thus the opposite of the
contrarian culture.

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.779
Essentially hipsters become a group on their own.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.780
A separate study in the Journal of Consumer
Research in 2010 found that, normally,

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.600
people don't just purchase products, they purchase
the emotion behind those products too.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.500
So buying a Jeep you'll feel rugged, or Lululemon will help you feel powerful in the gym or something.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.999
Hipsters, on the other hand, purchase

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:29.679
things that run counter to their emotional
interest -- like PBR.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.700
Their study say that hipsters are confounding for marketers

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.900
because they purchase things that they actually hate,

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.060
then subconsciously convince themselves they're not part of the trend that's bad.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.280
It doesn't reflect who they really are, man.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.940
According to Psychology Today's
report on the study, "the essence of being

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.760
a hipster [is] pretending you aren't one."

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.159
Which is super interesting if you think about
it, because this new math study sort of vogues

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.249
with their assessment. The researchers also
determined the ability of a hipster to see

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:58.769
the trend of wearing plaid or a beard or something,

00:01:58.769 --> 00:02:02.209
is more difficult the closer they
are to another hipster.

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:04.469
For example, two people in the same friend group

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.439
won't see themselves as alike because even
though they're both wearing vintage high-school,

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:10.399
sports-team t-shirts they got at Goodwill,

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.619
a stranger at a coffee shop would notice it right away, and they wouldn't

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.080
The further you are from the system in question, the easier it is to spot the correlation.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.900
Plus, the science of the hipster isn't just
limited to clothes and trends, there's also

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.599
huge music scenes associated with counterculture.
A service called Priceonomics used data from

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.779
Facebook in congress with a music blog called Pitchfork,

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:33.539
to determine how underground, and therefore hipster, a band could be.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.720
It was pretty accurate for 2013. Bands like Sun Kil Moon and The Field were considered very hipster.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.140
They had lots of critical acclaim, but very few shares

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.000
and mentions on a giant social network, Facebook,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.680
while Vampire Weekend was only a teeny bit hipster

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.480
because people shared it way too often. Way too pop culture, guys.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.060
Justin Timberlake? Not hipster in the least.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.720
Science, yo.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.239
Trends exist throughout pop culture, and because
hipsters buy a lot of stuff, researchers are

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.760
looking at their habits and social structures.
Interestingly, hipster is thought to be

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.280
someone who attempts a specific counterculture,
but in reality it does fit more with the dictionary

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.320
definition, "a person who follows the latest
trends and fashions."

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.580
At least, according to this math study.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.910
So with that, I say, the v-neck/moustache
combo is just the 20-teens version

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.100
of the Starter Jacket or parachute pants or big, feathered hair found in other decades.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.100
It was counterculture for a minute, and then
everyone started doing it, so it wasn't anymore.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.500
The counterculture becomes the culture so fast,

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.480
according to mathematics, that people can't adapt quick enough.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.159
In the end, people who try to
fight a trend, are copying other people, and

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:37.579
are therefore part of a trend.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.980
