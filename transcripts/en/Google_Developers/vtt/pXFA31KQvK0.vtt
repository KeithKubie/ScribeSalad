DANIEL SIEBERG: Hi there.

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:04.730
I'm Daniel Sieberg on
day two of I/O Live.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.500
And we are in the Chrome
showcase, joined right now by

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.810
NJ from Adobe to talk about a
couple of really cool projects

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.520
that you've been working on,
Shadow and Brackets.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.572
Which one do you want to
start with, by the way?

00:00:15.572 --> 00:00:16.650
NJ JARAMILLIO: Let's start
with Brackets.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.610
So Brackets is a free and
open-source code editor for

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:21.570
front-end web development.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.770
So it's built in HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript, and it's for

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.590
editing HTML and CSS
and JavaScript.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.590
So if you're the kind of person
who can use Brackets,

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.190
you do front-end web development
all day, you can

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.520
actually contribute to and
extend Brackets because it's

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.930
an open source project.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.260
So I'm going to go ahead
and launch it here.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.500
And you can see that although
it's built-in HTML, we're

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.120
currently packaging it as a
desktop application, mainly so

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.660
that you can edit the files
on your local hard drive.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.030
And we're actually using
a Chromium-based shell.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.730
So that's one of the ways that
we're using Google technology

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.410
to help with the project.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.810
So you can see that this
is actually the

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:50.710
Bracket source code.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.012
By default, Brackets opens
editing it's own source code--

00:00:53.012 --> 00:00:55.050
it's kind of this conception
thing.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.670
And you can see that it's got
the standard color coding and

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.510
other things that you would
want in a text editor.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.110
Now, it's not totally ready
for prime time yet.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.445
We've only been working on
it for a few months.

00:01:03.445 --> 00:01:05.170
But because it's open source,
we're hoping that the

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.250
community can jump in and
help make it better.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.100
And a couple of the ideas that
we're seeding, that we think

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.570
are a little bit innovative
about this, that you might not

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.450
find in a more generic text
editor, are focused on

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.330
front-end web development.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.600
So for example we have this
idea of quick editing.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.470
So here I've got a tag for Body,
and let's say I want to

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.770
tweak the styles for that.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.920
I can just hit a Quick Edit
key, and we find the rules

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.350
that are relevant to that tag.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.330
And then we just bring them
right in to here.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.390
You can tweak them quickly,
and then just dismiss the

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.080
editor really quickly.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.790
So you don't have to jump around
between files a lot.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.210
Or if I've got a tag that has
a bunch of rules applied, I

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.630
can browse between them.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.940
DANIEL SIEBERG: Very cool.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.630
So it's all about making life
a little easier and more

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.470
efficient when you're
working with code.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.100
NJ JARAMILLIO: Exactly.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.910
And then on top of that, we
have this idea of live

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:42.370
development.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.690
Again here, we're leveraging
the Chrome Developer tools.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.680
Now, normally when you use the
Chrome Developer tools or

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.970
other kinds of in-browser tools,
you're kind of poking

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.130
at stuff in the browser, and
you're copying and pasting

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.940
what you want to do back
into your code.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.840
But here we've actually enabled
it directly from your

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.400
code editor.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.770
So if I'm here in my real code,
this is my actual source

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.290
code, and I go and I start
typing, you can see it updates

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.495
the color--

00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:01.395
DANIEL SIEBERG: It's reflected
in the browser [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:01.395 --> 00:02:02.240
NJ JARAMILLIO: Exactly,
exactly.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.883
Or If I want tweak the margin
between these guys here, oh,

00:02:05.883 --> 00:02:08.190
they're a little too tight,
I start typing

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.110
a new margin value.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.210
And as I'm typing I can see,
oh, that's too big, oh,

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.110
that'll work nicely-- so
I have this really live

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.660
development experience.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.160
DANIEL SIEBERG: That's
really cool.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.440
All right, let's move on to
Shadow then and see what

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.070
that's all about.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.560
NJ JARAMILLIO: OK,
that's great.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.720
So Shadow is really aimed at,
again, speeding the workflow

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.170
of mobile web development.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.660
So a problem I have a lot is
I'm working on a mobile

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.815
website, and then I have to go
to all my different devices

00:02:27.815 --> 00:02:30.452
and check out what I did, and I
have to go and refresh, and

00:02:30.452 --> 00:02:30.550
all this all this
kind of stuff.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.000
DANIEL SIEBERG: See how it
looks, of course, which is

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.060
very important.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.590
NJ JARAMILLIO: Exactly.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.760
Shadow makes it really
easy to just do it

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.920
all from your desktop.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.660
So I've got this little
shadow extension.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.410
Again, it's built as
a Chrome extension.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.590
And you can see that I've got
all my devices connected here.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.810
So now let me go to a website
like the Boston Globe website,

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.210
which is well known
for being a good,

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.630
responsive design website.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:47.050
And I go there.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.420
And you see, as soon as I go
here it starts to refresh on

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.100
all my devices.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.230
I don't have to touch
them at all.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.560
DANIEL SIEBERG: I don't know
if folks can see that here,

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.030
but it is on all of
these devices.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.140
It happened almost
simultaneously.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.190
NJ JARAMILLIO: Exactly.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.530
So I've got my iPad, I've got
my brand-new Nexus 7 here--

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.225
plug--

00:02:59.225 --> 00:03:00.430
and all that stuff.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.320
And you can see that as I
navigate around, it's

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.330
following what I'm doing.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.075
So it's literally shadowing what
I'm doing, which is where

00:03:06.075 --> 00:03:07.570
the name comes from.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.670
And so this is available as a
free download right now, as a

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.700
preview release on Adobe
Labs at labs.adobe.com.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.330
DANIEL SIEBERG: Very cool.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.060
And so, any learnings that you
want to pass on to other

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.200
developers as you work on
both of these projects?

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.230
NJ JARAMILLIO: Well one of
things, especially for

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.390
Brackets, is we found that some
people say things like,

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.190
is JavaScript a robust enough
language for doing this kind

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.720
of web development?

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.870
And we found that actually, you
can build a high-quality

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.220
performant text editor with file
access and all this kind

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.340
of stuff, built directly in
JavaScript and CSS and HTML.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.100
And we've learned a lot by doing
this project, and we

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.250
also want to hear from people
who are much more experienced

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.370
developers than us.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.370
Take a look at our
source code.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.800
We're on GitHub,
github.com/adobe/brackets.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.760
You can come, fork the code,
make a pull request, build

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.220
extensions.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.240
We really want the community to
contribute their own ideas

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.140
to it, because we think it's
really going to be a great

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.650
platform for text editors for
web development in the future.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.800
DANIEL SIEBERG: All right.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.010
I love that collaborative
effort.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.784
NJ, thank you so much.

00:03:59.784 --> 00:03:59.895
We appreiate it.

00:03:59.895 --> 00:04:00.091
NJ JARAMILLIO: All right.

00:04:00.091 --> 00:04:01.070
Thanks very much.

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.240
DANIEL SIEBERG: OK.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.610
We turn now to the
guys at Autodesk.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.990
And I'm sorry, Randy, I forgot
to bring my 3D glasses.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.760
Is that going to be all right?

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.635
Can we still check
this stuff out?

00:04:08.635 --> 00:04:10.520
RANDY YOUNG: Yeah, we have
things in reality here, so

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.120
you'll be fine.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.425
DANIEL SIEBERG: All right.

00:04:11.425 --> 00:04:14.700
Well, so we're talking about the
ability to share and view

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.200
files from a desktop
to the cloud.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.140
Walk me through what
you've got.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.620
RANDY YOUNG: OK.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.990
So I'm here to talk about
Autodesk 360, which is our

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:23.080
cloud offering to enable
our desktops to share

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.810
over mobile and web.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.970
And so what we did here for
Google I/O is we connected

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.170
into Google Drive through a
Chrome map, to display large

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.640
files in the web browser.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.150
DANIEL SIEBERG: And so some of
these are 3D objects that

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.450
normally would be very
difficult, if not

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:39.150
impossible to view?

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.210
RANDY YOUNG: Yeah.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.740
So without the desktop apps,
just until recently, you

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.040
wouldn't be able to share
these files at

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.390
all over the web.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:49.210
So we actually created this
WebGL plug-in that will allow

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.986
you to view large-format files
on the web browser.

00:04:51.986 --> 00:04:52.280
DANIEL SIEBERG: All right.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.030
Let's have a look.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.340
RANDY YOUNG: OK.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:59.040
So what we did was you
can get in through

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.960
adding the app to Chrome.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.150
And then through Google Drive
you can actually share files

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.200
with people that don't actually
have the desktop app.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:11.480
And through the plug-in they
can see these large models,

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.280
and even click on objects and
highlight and get metadata

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.430
inside of the objects.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.260
So it's really enabling people
to see their designs and share

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.420
their designs with people that
don't necessarily have the

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:24.280
desktop apps.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.030
DANIEL SIEBERG: That's
fantastic.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.430
Great.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.840
Anything else you want to
mention real quick?

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.840
RANDY YOUNG: Just go visit
us on 360.autodesk.com.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:30.500
DANIEL SIEBERG:
360.autodesk.com.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.870
All right.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:31.590
Randy, thank you so much.

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.150
We're going to move on now and
talk to Michael, who's got a

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.950
demo for us here involving the
ability to capture objects

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.660
using a camera on a different
device, and then get this

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.180
mesh, and finally print it
out through a 3D printer.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.090
Walk us through this.

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.860
MICHAEL BEALE: That's right.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.670
We've got a video playing
in the background here.

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.090
And it's an example of Chris
here, taking photographs of a

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.400
flower that he's seen
in the market.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.530
And he's reconstructing a 3D
mesh from all the different

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:58.450
camera angles.

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:01.050
It's a product we've
given to the

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.550
community called 123D Catch--

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:08.030
something that you can get on
our website if you go to

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:13.440
123Dapp.com.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.005
Once you've taken those photos
and you've reconstructed the

00:06:16.005 --> 00:06:21.270
mesh, you can print them out
through cardboard cutouts.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.170
So if you've got some paper and
scissors you can cut out

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:27.490
these little templates,
use a Chromebook.

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.320
It's a WebGL app, so it's
accessible by lots of

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.810
different browsers, et cetera.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:34.830
DANIEL SIEBERG: And you've been
working with the folks at

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.150
MakerBot, I see.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:37.240
MICHAEL BEALE: Right.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.820
The tech shop guys, with
their laser cutters.

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.980
We tried out some
of these ideas.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.370
And we've cut out, here, a
Tyrannosaurus Rex with

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.860
cardboard using some
laser cutters.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.380
Using that same 3D
mesh, we can also

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.200
send it to a 3D printer.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.590
So this is one of the MakerBot
3D printers.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.730
And we've been demonstrating
here at Google I/O how we can

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:01.600
print out something
like a little

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.180
owl made of PVC plastic.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:08.250
It takes about half an hour
to print one of these out.

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:12.720
But it demonstrates for the
consumer market that they can

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.390
get something from taking a
photograph and bring it all

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:18.143
the way to something that they
can prototype very quickly.

00:07:18.143 --> 00:07:18.590
DANIEL SIEBERG: A
tangible object.

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:18.940
MICHAEL BEALE: Yeah.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:19.550
DANIEL SIEBERG: That's
amazing.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.310
All right, any lessons you want
to pass along as you went

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:23.790
through this project?

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:26.470
MICHAEL BEALE: I think if I
could probably give something

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:30.660
back to the developer community,
I'd say, keep

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.530
pushing for WebGL and
the open standards.

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:37.180
We're trying to move all of
our desktop things to give

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:37.900
them reach.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.840
So WebGL's a great standard
to push forward.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:41.470
DANIEL SIEBERG: Extremely
powerful.

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:43.430
We'd love to see wider adoption
of it, of course.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.870
MICHAEL BEALE: That's it.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:44.210
DANIEL SIEBERG: All right.

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:46.736
Well, are you going to play with
your models here as we

00:07:46.736 --> 00:07:46.918
say goodbye?

00:07:46.918 --> 00:07:47.510
Is there anything else?

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:49.200
MICHAEL BEALE: We'll probably
print a few more out for you.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:49.380
DANIEL SIEBERG: Print
a few more out?

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.460
OK, cool.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:51.295
Michael, thank you so much.

00:07:51.295 --> 00:07:52.150
We appreciate it.

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:53.280
MICHAEL BEALE: Pleasure.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:53.510
DANIEL SIEBERG: All right.

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:56.170
For this segment I feel like I
should be doing a cartwheel in

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:58.570
or something more dramatic.

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:00.630
We're talking about Cirque du
Soleil and we're joined by

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:02.390
Chris from Subatomic
Systems and Justin

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:03.830
from Cirque du Soleil.

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:06.850
I'm really excited to see this
demo, so maybe Chris, can you

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:08.330
talk me through what
was involved with

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:09.250
putting this together?

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:10.820
CHRIS WEBB: Sure.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:16.230
So Movi.Kanti.Revo is an
interactive journey that takes

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:20.480
the user through an imaginary
world of beauty and awe and

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:24.270
wonder, and is designed
primarily to engage the

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:27.820
person's imagination and
evoke their emotions.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:32.480
And it utilized the latest
web technologies that are

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.240
supported by Google
Chrome to do this.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:40.510
So the experience itself,
which we have here, is a

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:44.280
preview for Google I/O. And the
full version of this will

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.300
launch in September.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.810
DANIEL SIEBERG: Now I'm going to
get you to walk us through

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:49.260
the demo while Justin, you talk
us through the narrative

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.030
of what's going on here with
the Cirque du Soleil theme.

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:53.250
So can you go ahead and
walk us through?

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:53.940
CHRIS WEBB: Sure thing.

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.130
DANIEL SIEBERG: So Justin, go
ahead and describe what we're

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:56.380
seeing here.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.260
JUSTIN GILBERT: So we started
with the experiment.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:07.980
So we see the immersive world.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:12.875
And actually you see the girl.

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.870
DANIEL SIEBERG: What
is she doing here?

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:20.840
CHRIS WEBB: This is our guide.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:25.000
And here at the intro, at this
stage she's showing the user

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.735
how to interact, to navigate
through the experience.

00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:30.320
DANIEL SIEBERG: Because
obviously there's no menu that

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.330
comes up or anything
like that.

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:32.260
CHRIS WEBB: No, there's
no menu that comes up.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:33.690
DANIEL SIEBERG: But you can
interact with it in ways that

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:34.790
you wouldn't expect,
necessarily.

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:35.170
CHRIS WEBB: Correct.

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:36.260
Yeah.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.450
This interactive experience
utilizes getUserMedia to

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:44.350
recognize the user's face and
then detects movement of the

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:47.370
user to actually navigate
through the experience.

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:51.000
So there, the guide is
showing us if we lean

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.220
left, it moves left.

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.580
If we lean right,
it moves right.

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.000
If we look up, down, the camera
moves accordingly.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.180
DANIEL SIEBERG: Now can you walk
us through some more of

00:09:58.180 --> 00:09:59.385
the sequences here?

00:09:59.385 --> 00:10:00.635
CHRIS WEBB: Sure.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:08.110
She's about to come back.

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:09.990
OK.

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:13.480
DANIEL SIEBERG: Oh,
I hear her coming.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.260
And what's the overall goal with
this, Justin, in terms of

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.470
the user experience and getting
into that Cirque du

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:22.560
Soleil world-- which people know
maybe from watching one

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.491
of the performances, but online,
what's the hope in

00:10:25.491 --> 00:10:26.780
terms of terms of
user experience?

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:27.500
JUSTIN GILBERT: Yeah.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:32.240
Basically when you see a show
we put people on the edge of

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.245
their seat because
we want people to

00:10:35.245 --> 00:10:36.790
connect to their emotion.

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:40.135
And what we want to achieve with
this kind of application

00:10:40.135 --> 00:10:45.150
is just to reproduce this in
the interactive space.

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:46.385
DANIEL SIEBERG: There
she is again.

00:10:46.385 --> 00:10:48.210
OK, so what's she doing here?

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:50.880
CHRIS WEBB: This is one setting
in the journey.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:54.090
Again this is a preview, so
we're getting an abbreviated

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:54.840
experience.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.080
And then the full experience
that comes out in September

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.260
will be a beginning to end
journey that takes us through

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:04.060
a number of settings within
this imaginary world.

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:08.990
And here, our guide is about
to take the leap of faith,

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:11.210
which will take us to
the next setting.

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:14.780
And as a user, you actually
follow her as

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:17.940
she takes the leap.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:21.060
DANIEL SIEBERG: And you can
control some elements of her

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:22.890
experience as she's going
through this?

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:23.080
CHRIS WEBB: Yeah.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.100
In fact, I'll use a keyboard
here for the demo purpose to

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:32.270
show you how the user, if they
move left or right, can

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:34.037
control the world--

00:11:34.037 --> 00:11:35.287
DANIEL SIEBERG: Wow.

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:39.790
CHRIS WEBB: --and actually
move through it.

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:43.210
So you're literally traveling
through the world based on

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:43.890
your movements.

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:44.740
DANIEL SIEBERG: Wow.

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:45.250
That's awesome.

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:47.940
Well, Justin from Cirque du
Soleil, and Chris from

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.300
Subatomic Systems, I know
you guys have worked

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:50.420
really hard on this.

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.890
And I think that a lot of folks
are going to be excited

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:53.740
to try it out.

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:55.150
Thank you so much for giving
us a little preview.

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:56.960
I'm going to cartwheel
out of here and move

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:57.860
on to the next one.

00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:58.460
Thanks, guys.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:11:58.760
JUSTIN GILBERT: You're
welcome.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.010
CHRIS WEBB: Sure thing.
