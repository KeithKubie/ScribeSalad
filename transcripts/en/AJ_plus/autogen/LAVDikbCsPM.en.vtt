backwards you know we've been in the EU
for more than 40 years now and it's

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820
for more than 40 years now and it's
 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.210
for more than 40 years now and it's
going to place us back where we were in

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220
going to place us back where we were in
 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.140
going to place us back where we were in
the 1960s basically really yeah

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150
the 1960s basically really yeah

obviously some things have changed but

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920
obviously some things have changed but
 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.009
obviously some things have changed but
it's the kind of mentality that goes

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:39.019
it's the kind of mentality that goes
 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:41.590
it's the kind of mentality that goes
with it which I cannot worry about

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600
with it which I cannot worry about
 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.280
with it which I cannot worry about
particularly why did this happen well if

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290
particularly why did this happen well if
 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.119
particularly why did this happen well if
you take immigration for example there

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129
you take immigration for example there
 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.369

are actually no votes in a politician

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:53.950
are actually no votes in a politician
saying well actually we need immigrants

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960
saying well actually we need immigrants
 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.410
saying well actually we need immigrants
to keep the country running and so this

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420
to keep the country running and so this
 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.720

is brexit is a sort of British

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730
is brexit is a sort of British
 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.790
is brexit is a sort of British
independence movement and it is

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800
independence movement and it is
 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.560
independence movement and it is
sometimes characterizing those terms

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570
sometimes characterizing those terms
 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:03.880
sometimes characterizing those terms
that you know like a country which has

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890
that you know like a country which has
 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.820
that you know like a country which has
been colonized and finally becoming

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830
been colonized and finally becoming
 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.700
been colonized and finally becoming
independent which is really sort of a

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710
independent which is really sort of a
 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.469
independent which is really sort of a
completely ridiculous way to view it is

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479
completely ridiculous way to view it is
 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.870
completely ridiculous way to view it is
there a connection between brexit and

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880
there a connection between brexit and
 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.290
there a connection between brexit and
what we've seen happen and for

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300
what we've seen happen and for
 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.120
what we've seen happen and for
recently I do see some parallels

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130
recently I do see some parallels
 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.720
recently I do see some parallels
particularly with this British

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730
particularly with this British
 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.960
particularly with this British
government after the referendum the

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970
government after the referendum the
 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.630
government after the referendum the
government has become much more

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640
government has become much more
 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.690
government has become much more
authoritarian in quite a lot of ways and

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700
authoritarian in quite a lot of ways and
 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.330
authoritarian in quite a lot of ways and
I think that's a result of the brexit

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340
I think that's a result of the brexit
 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.380
I think that's a result of the brexit
vote and the 2-year time limit or

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390
vote and the 2-year time limit or
 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.020
vote and the 2-year time limit or
negotiating with the EU what we're

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030
negotiating with the EU what we're
 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.550
negotiating with the EU what we're
seeing is an attitude which face similar

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560
seeing is an attitude which face similar
 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.780
seeing is an attitude which face similar
to what we've seen in some of the Arab

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790
to what we've seen in some of the Arab
 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.180
to what we've seen in some of the Arab
countries regarding the Arab League

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190
countries regarding the Arab League
 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.860
countries regarding the Arab League
which was their kind of hopes founded on

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870
which was their kind of hopes founded on
 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.590
which was their kind of hopes founded on
the problem of national sovereignty and

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600
the problem of national sovereignty and
 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.320
the problem of national sovereignty and
again we come back to borders and

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330
again we come back to borders and
 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.930
again we come back to borders and
borders are not you know passports had

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.180
borders are not you know passports had

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190
not actually been in existence for that
 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.360
not actually been in existence for that
long you know even in Europe you know

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370

some countries were unified into what
 

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:11.470

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.240
it's something you can resist because of
the way the world works countries are

the way the world works countries are
 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.550
the way the world works countries are

and so you can't just do whatever you
 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.610
and so you can't just do whatever you
want within your national boundaries you

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620
want within your national boundaries you
 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.770
want within your national boundaries you
know the classic example is something

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780
know the classic example is something
 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.380
know the classic example is something
like global warming you know where if

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390
like global warming you know where if
 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.930
like global warming you know where if
all you know what you need is an

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940
all you know what you need is an
 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.000
all you know what you need is an
agreement where all the countries make

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010
agreement where all the countries make
 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.100

some contribution to reducing emissions
 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.680
some contribution to reducing emissions
and that sort of thing and you can't

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690
and that sort of thing and you can't
 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.540
and that sort of thing and you can't
really have one or two who decide that

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550
really have one or two who decide that
 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.110
