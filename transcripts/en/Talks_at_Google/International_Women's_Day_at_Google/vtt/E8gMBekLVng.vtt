STACY SULLIVAN:
Well, you can see

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.450
how popular you are
within the Googlers.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.900
So I wanted to welcome
Ana Ivanovic to Google,

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.480
to the Googleplex.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.900
We're so excited that
you're here visiting today,

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.910
that you're here for
Bank of the West.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.180
So hi everybody,
I'm Stacy Sullivan,

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.890
I'm one of the old
time Googlers here.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.670
I'm also the-- quote unquote,
the executive champion

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.492
of the tennis team, the
Google tennis team which

00:00:35.492 --> 00:00:37.200
has won the league
the last couple years.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.480
So, yay to us.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.300
We've got a lot of strong
players here at Google.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.380
Ana is a former
world number one.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.960
Now in your 11th year
on the pro circuit.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.390
Ranked 11th in the
world currently,

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.300
has won an impressive 14 WTA
single titles in your career,

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.220
including one Grand Slam title
as the 2008 French Open singles

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.610
champion.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.890
She became a UNICEF National
Ambassador for Serbia in 2007,

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.620
named one of the 30
Legends of Women's Tennis

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.920
Past, Present and Future by
Time Magazine in June 2011.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.630
And as far as I know, does not
sleep in a hyperbaric chamber,

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.382
like Novak Djokovic.

00:01:18.382 --> 00:01:19.840
As I was coming
over here, my group

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.776
was asking if you sleep in that
oxygen chamber like Djokovic.

00:01:22.776 --> 00:01:25.400
I said, no, just because they're
from the same country does not

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.580
mean they all do that.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.880
And no, they are not dating.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.760
They all want to know,
like, do they-- no.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.680
Separate person,
she's incredible,

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.940
and we're so happy
to have you here.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.510
And in true Google
fashion, we'd like

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.050
to have a Googler, an avid
tennis player and coach

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.180
himself, Jonas, who's hit
10 years now at Google,

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.510
conduct an informal
interview today.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.970
Just so we get to
know Ana a bit more.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.240
So we're really limited
on time, so we're

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.730
going to keep questions going
for maybe 10 or 15 minutes,

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.230
and then open it
up to the audience.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.030
JONAS: All right,
thanks for coming.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.613
We had a little bit
of a chat outside,

00:02:02.613 --> 00:02:05.161
I tried to prep you for
the room a little bit.

00:02:05.161 --> 00:02:06.660
So, I'm a tennis
player, but I think

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.780
we have a lot of tennis players
at Google in general, people

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.179
really excited about the sport.

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.220
And so just so that we
know who we're talking to,

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.511
who's a test tennis player
in the audience, real quick?

00:02:14.511 --> 00:02:16.840
ANA IVANOVIC: Oh my God!

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.246
JONAS: So we have 200
tennis players right here.

00:02:20.246 --> 00:02:22.460
Cool, who's a fan of Ana's?

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.280
ANA IVANOVIC: Now you
put them on the spot!

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.660
JONAS: I know, how
could they say no?

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.000
So I think we're all
really excited to have you,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.875
and so you've had a
really, really good year,

00:02:32.875 --> 00:02:33.950
I think, last year.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.240
And was wondering
if we could maybe

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.770
talk a little bit about that.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.220
So what happened this year,
compared to the last three

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.480
years that you played,
that gave you two titles?

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.430
I think you beat Serena
at the Aussie Open,

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.554
and did a few other things.

00:02:47.554 --> 00:02:48.630
So what changed?

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.542
ANA IVANOVIC: Yeah.

00:02:49.542 --> 00:02:51.250
First of all it's my
pleasure to be here.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.940
I've been to Stanford
a couple of times,

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.010
and I think it's exciting
to see a little bit

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.400
different side of the
city, and to see something

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.250
other than the tennis court.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.830
But yeah, I think this
season has been great for me.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.034
I actually have
three titles, and I'm

00:03:05.034 --> 00:03:06.950
making quarterfinal the
first year at an Open,

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.250
beating Serena.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.907
And I think, not only in
sports, but in life in general,

00:03:11.907 --> 00:03:13.740
you go through ups and
downs, and you learn.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.930
And I started this very
young, and as Stacy mentioned,

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.320
I've been on tour for 11 years.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.390
It makes me feel really old,
even though I'm not that old.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.960
But you have the
different experiences,

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.010
and this year has been
good, and I'm really

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.715
enjoying competing, and
going through the challenges.

00:03:32.715 --> 00:03:34.090
JONAS: So did you
change anything

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.460
in terms of how you
practice, or did

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.030
you tweak any of your strokes?

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.829
Or do fitness stuff,
or did anything

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.120
make a difference in your game?

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.703
ANA IVANOVIC:
Everything a little bit,

00:03:43.703 --> 00:03:45.680
but it's mostly
all in the mindset.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.560
You know, when your mind is
set, when you have certain goals

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.970
and you work towards something,
and you have a big picture,

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.560
makes it so much easier to
know you have a purpose.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.450
And everyday you try
to improve, and you

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.770
try to learn, and
try to get better.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.500
JONAS: OK.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.960
So we have a new coach,
was just in the news,

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.659
we had a chat earlier
too, so welcome.

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:08.950
So when you pick a new coach,
what are you looking for?

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.101
What's important to
you in your game?

00:04:11.101 --> 00:04:12.351
ANA IVANOVIC: Can you please--

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.800
JONAS: I think we're OK.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.320
ANA IVANOVIC: Well I think
it's very, very important

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.040
to understand each other
and to communicate well.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.576
Because tennis is
such a specific sport,

00:04:24.576 --> 00:04:25.950
because it's an
individual sport,

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.940
you spend so much
time with the person.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.520
You really need to get
along, but also the coach

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.797
needs to understand the
way your game develops,

00:04:34.797 --> 00:04:36.130
and the way your game should be.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.150
Because every player
is different, and yeah,

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.580
I think it's very important
to find someone who's

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.600
going to motivate you,
inspire you and support you.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.350
I think the support
is very important,

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.130
because people see us competing.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.110
And on court, we are on our own.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.750
But there is so much more
to it, behind the court

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:54.640
and behind the scene.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.730
And all the hard
work, it's actually

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:57.822
done off the match court.

00:04:57.822 --> 00:05:00.030
JONAS: Yeah, I watched you
guys practice a little bit

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.040
yesterday, and I see a
lot of laughter on court.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.980
You missed the box, but we're
not going to talk about that.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:08.980
Today, you made it.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:09.980
OK.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.190
So they were trying to toss
tennis balls into a box,

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.100
and it was mixed results.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.750
So how important is that,
to also have a lot of fun?

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.020
You know, there's a lot of-- you
have pressure, there is media,

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.980
there is these things.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.550
So what does humor and
fun have to do with it?

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.716
ANA IVANOVIC: I think it's
very important, you know?

00:05:28.716 --> 00:05:31.280
Because like I said, we do
this for so long and we travel,

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.130
and it's not easy.

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.690
We are always on the road,
not with friends or family.

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.510
And it's very important to
have that laughter, and joke,

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:41.780
and understand each other.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.402
Because there is time
to be serious, but there

00:05:44.402 --> 00:05:47.600
is also time to be
relaxed and fun.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.480
And we try to play
jokes on each other.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.980
Yeah.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.010
And try to make it
more fun for everyone.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.564
JONAS: OK.

00:05:54.564 --> 00:05:56.230
And then Stacy just
mentioned, so you're

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.810
playing tomorrow, Bank
of the West Tournament,

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.500
just across the street.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.580
So how do your days before the
tournament usually look like?

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.640
So how do you
organize your days?

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:06.910
How much do still practice?

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:08.910
Do you still tweak little
things here and there?

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.100
Or is it--

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.750
ANA IVANOVIC: It really depends
where in the season we are,

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.160
and this is the first
tournament after the break.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.740
So I had a fair bit
of practice lately.

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.040
This morning I
practiced only once.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.960
And yeah, normally I do
that, I do some recovery,

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.385
and then I basically
relax and read and then

00:06:27.385 --> 00:06:29.220
have an easy dinner later on.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.760
And just try to rest and
be fresh for tomorrow.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.940
But in the lead up, I had
a little bit more of work

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:35.700
and a lot of gym.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:36.514
JONAS: Right.

00:06:36.514 --> 00:06:38.930
And then do you still-- like
when the tournament is coming

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.096
up, do you still tweak
little things here and there?

00:06:41.096 --> 00:06:43.970
Like with your work on, I don't
know, like footwork stuff,

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.196
or maybe change a little
bit of the strokes?

00:06:46.196 --> 00:06:48.320
Or is it really more about
finding rhythm, and just

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.110
getting used to the
conditions and everything?

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.360
ANA IVANOVIC: Of course,
finding rhythm is a priority,

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.220
but we will always work on a
few little specific things,

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.050
you know that-- maybe one
day you don't feel so good.

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:01.555
Whether it's a
volley, or a return,

00:07:01.555 --> 00:07:04.300
or a serve or something that
we'll tweak a little bit,

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.472
and also adjust depending
on the opponent you play.

00:07:07.472 --> 00:07:09.180
JONAS: OK, so some
people in the audience

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.867
know, I lost my topspin
backhand a little bit.

00:07:11.867 --> 00:07:13.450
ANA IVANOVIC: That
happened to me too.

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:15.410
JONAS: OK, so we'll
talk about that.

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.080
Look for it together.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.627
So what do you do in that case?

00:07:18.627 --> 00:07:20.585
So if you feel you lost
confidence a little bit

00:07:20.585 --> 00:07:22.100
in a stroke, how
do you get it back?

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.724
ANA IVANOVIC: It's hard, because
actually it's all in the mind.

00:07:24.724 --> 00:07:27.600
But the mind can be
such a tricky thing.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.790
And I think it's very important
to just go back to the basics.

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:35.230
And trying to move your feet,
because once you're nervous,

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:38.440
or you think you lost the shot,
the first thing that stops

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.000
is the feet.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.140
And then you're not in a
position to hit better.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:45.390
So then get back to
that first moment.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:48.150
It's very important to try
and get that flow happening.

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.870
And also try to let go,
even if you miss a few,

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.370
and try to get it
out and then sort

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:55.580
of start from the beginning.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.339
JONAS: OK.

00:07:57.339 --> 00:07:59.130
So we have in the
audience today, obviously

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:00.200
a lot of tennis players.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.980
There's a former
touring pro, and we

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:05.400
have something
some younger folks.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.560
I know you started around
when you were five,

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.530
and you played a lot.

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:12.320
What advice do you have
for our younger players who

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.486
would want to come up,
and maybe give it a shot

00:08:14.486 --> 00:08:16.110
to become a professional
tennis player?

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:18.689
What's the-- is there
a most important thing

00:08:18.689 --> 00:08:19.730
that you would tell them?

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:21.735
ANA IVANOVIC: I think
it's a few things that

00:08:21.735 --> 00:08:22.750
have to come together.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:24.980
But I think the
most important is,

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.990
if they believe they have a
shot, to really commit to it.

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:31.060
Because there is no
doing it half way.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.789
They really have to
embrace the competition.

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:35.510
And enjoy it as well.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:38.630
And try to be
passionate about it.

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:41.794
And like I said before, you
have to wake up with a purpose,

00:08:41.794 --> 00:08:44.460
and think this is what I want to
do, and what I want to achieve.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:47.490
And only then, you're honest
to yourself and say OK,

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:49.000
I gave you the best shot.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.290
And yeah, I think tennis
is such a fun game,

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:55.180
and every point is different.

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:58.410
And I think that's something
that I enjoy doing.

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:02.180
I feel if they're-- want to
pursue it, and they enjoy it,

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:03.630
I think they should go for it.

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.120
JONAS: When you were growing
up, I assume you played a lot,

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:06.820
you drove a lot.

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:08.060
It wasn't that your
parents said, Ana,

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.643
you need to play more, we want
you to be a professional tennis

00:09:10.643 --> 00:09:11.630
player.

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:14.322
Where did that
motivation come from?

00:09:14.322 --> 00:09:16.280
ANA IVANOVIC: It was a
very specific situation,

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.930
because I wanted to play
tennis, and I watched it on TV,

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:23.460
and I was very stubborn
since I was very young,

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:24.710
so I was like, I want a play.

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:26.959
So for fifth birthday,
it was my present,

00:09:26.959 --> 00:09:28.000
and that's how I started.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.350
No one in my family ever
played tennis before,

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:33.270
and they still don't.

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:34.770
Which is a good thing, I guess.

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:37.930
My brother always jokes
that I played with everyone,

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:38.860
but never with him.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:42.610
Which is kind of true,
and sad at the same.

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:46.540
But yeah, but I had full
support from my family.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:50.160
And I must say, in tennis we
have lots of crazy parents,

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:54.192
and I'm very proud that my
parents are not one of those.

00:09:54.192 --> 00:09:56.150
JONAS: We used to joke
about that at home, too.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:59.440
So they're sometimes more
ambitious and intense

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.780
than the kids themselves.

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:03.600
ANA IVANOVIC: And then I
think that's very important,

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.690
that kids start to realize that
it's their dream if they want

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:09.760
to pursue it, and
not that they're

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.140
doing it for their parents.

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:13.430
Because sooner or later,
that's going to wear out.

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:18.020
And then they're going to be
stuck somewhere in between.

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:19.737
So I was very fortunate.

00:10:19.737 --> 00:10:21.320
JONAS: So I was in
the same situation,

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:25.370
but I didn't make it on tour,
but Google is not bad, either.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:26.370
ANA IVANOVIC: Beautiful.

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:28.328
JONAS: Yeah, so we were
just talking-- actually

00:10:28.328 --> 00:10:30.140
you were just asking
me outside what

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:31.850
we're doing here and everything.

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:35.527
So in general, we're a lot
about data, technology, gadgets.

00:10:35.527 --> 00:10:37.610
There's a lot of sensors
coming out on the market.

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:39.130
And one thing that
I'm interested in

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:42.610
is, how has technology
changed the game for you?

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:44.570
You've been on tour
for 10, 11 years--

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:48.120
do you feel an impact
of technology at all?

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:52.014
So we all know Hawkeye,
rackets, Wii Play, stats,

00:10:52.014 --> 00:10:53.680
so anything that
really changed for you?

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.055
ANA IVANOVIC:
Definitely, I think

00:10:55.055 --> 00:10:57.060
that technology changed
the game so much.

00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:00.540
Basically from the first
time I played on tour

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.600
until this moment, I feel.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.080
With better strings,
better rackets,

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:08.030
I feel there are
much more players

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:12.100
who can produce a sort
of power, if they are not

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:12.850
a powerful player.

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:16.770
And then helped to sort of
even the game a little bit.

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:20.390
So the talent is not as
vital as it was before.

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:23.425
Because now you can compensate,
if you're not a big hitter,

00:11:23.425 --> 00:11:24.550
you can get looser strings.

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:27.330
Or if you hit flat,
you can get strings

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:28.690
that give you more spin.

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:31.740
So in that sense, it
changed tennis a lot,

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:35.890
and it did get
faster and stronger.

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:37.490
They tried to slow
the courts down,

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:40.180
so they still make it
more fun for, I guess,

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:43.080
audience, and also for
us a little bit harder.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.015
But yeah, it did change a lot.

00:11:45.015 --> 00:11:46.952
And obviously Hawkeye
is a big part, too.

00:11:46.952 --> 00:11:49.410
JONAS: Do you feel the games
getting more and more similar,

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:52.140
between the different
surfaces, is that---?

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:55.040
ANA IVANOVIC: Well, the
movement is a lot different,

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.700
when you change
surfaces, that's sort

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.620
of the first thing
you want to work on.

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:02.510
But the game itself, still on
clay, you can use more spin,

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:04.530
and grass courts are
a little bit faster,

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:05.910
and flatter and lower.

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:09.800
So you can see the difference
from surface to surface,

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.932
but it definitely got
a lot more powerful.

00:12:12.932 --> 00:12:15.390
JONAS: So I have to ask you
one weird question, as a tennis

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:16.049
player.

00:12:16.049 --> 00:12:18.340
So we have-- a lot of people
in the audience are always

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:20.910
trying new rackets and
changing weight balance and all

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:21.490
that stuff.

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:25.590
How much has your racket string
set up changed over the years?

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:27.750
Have you found
your perfect setup?

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:29.150
ANA IVANOVIC: Minimal.

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:30.740
JONAS: So you
still pretty much--

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:31.656
ANA IVANOVIC: Exactly.

00:12:31.656 --> 00:12:33.169
Changing rackets
and strings, it's

00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:34.710
like a little bit
changing technique.

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:37.540
Because obviously,
technology is improving

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:40.200
and you have little
tweaks here and there.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.370
And I've been very fortunate
in playing everything

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:45.680
on [INAUDIBLE] now,
five years six years?

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:49.870
So they do improve, but
it's always similar balance

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:51.970
to the one I'm used to.

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:54.680
There is not that much of a
difference, which is important.

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.383
Because you find
something that is good,

00:12:56.383 --> 00:12:58.466
and to get used to something
completely different,

00:12:58.466 --> 00:12:59.470
it takes a long time.

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:00.290
JONAS: OK.

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:03.524
Cool, so I'm sure we have a
room full of questions here.

00:13:03.524 --> 00:13:04.940
AUDIENCE: I don't
have a question,

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:10.753
but I think it's a nice thing
to welcome you [SERBIAN] Google.

00:13:10.753 --> 00:13:12.086
ANA IVANOVIC: [SPEAKING SERBIAN]

00:13:12.086 --> 00:13:13.984
Very nice.

00:13:13.984 --> 00:13:15.400
AUDIENCE: Thanks
again for coming.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:19.360
I was just wondering, During the
first few games of any match,

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:23.900
how do you try to dictate the
pace and style of the match

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:27.860
to sort of to suit
your game of play?

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:29.420
What are some
things that you do?

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:30.920
ANA IVANOVIC: Well
this is something

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.620
that I've talking to my
coach a lot about this week.

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:37.200
And just starting the
matches, because it really

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.940
depends what kind
of form I feel.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:41.032
And if I feel the
ball really good,

00:13:41.032 --> 00:13:42.740
i will start really
aggressive, sometimes

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:44.240
I will start a
little bit tentative.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.290
But we spoke about
this, and that it's

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:48.030
important in these
first few games

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:49.950
to sort of impose
your game, and to try

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:53.630
to still swing true
and get that rhythm.

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:57.230
Because then the opponent
will feel more pressure,

00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:01.620
and then sort of set
the tone for the match.

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:04.470
So it's very important to let
go in the first two games, sense

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:12.500
and try to go for it with
exaggerated movement footwork.

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:13.354
AUDIENCE: Hi Ana.

00:14:13.354 --> 00:14:14.770
When you prepare
for your matches,

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:18.002
do you look at a lot of
data about your opponent?

00:14:18.002 --> 00:14:20.210
ANA IVANOVIC: That's the
job the coach normally does.

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:25.600
Yeah, so if you
have any research,

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.700
you can give it to him.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.660
No, but I think it's very
important, because even

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.840
though we played against
each other a few times

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:37.140
and we know a lot
of players, still

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:38.790
it depends what
kind of form they

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:40.500
are, depends on the
surface as well.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:44.070
So coach does the research
and then we speak about tactic

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:44.952
before the match.

00:14:44.952 --> 00:14:46.410
AUDIENCE: When you
were number one,

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:50.450
did you notice a big change
in how you were perceived

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:52.935
by the public, by the media,
by your sponsors, by everyone?

00:14:52.935 --> 00:14:55.720
And was that a big
change from being

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.575
number one versus number
two, let's say, or lower?

00:14:58.575 --> 00:14:59.700
ANA IVANOVIC: Yeah, it was.

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:03.530
And when I became number one,
I was only 20 at the time.

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:06.920
And it was-- because I
was very shy as a kid,

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.480
so it kind of was
a big shock for me.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.574
And I didn't really know how
to handle that spotlight.

00:15:12.574 --> 00:15:14.740
Because all of a sudden
there was so much attention,

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:16.780
and it brought a
lot of pressures,

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:17.950
a lot of expectations.

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:21.330
And up to that point, I
didn't have any of that.

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:24.140
So to get used to that,
it took some time.

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.810
And yeah, like I said,
I was only 20 years old.

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:29.320
So also very young and immature.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.470
So since then I
think I changed a lot

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:35.844
and I got some more
experience in that area, too.

00:15:35.844 --> 00:15:37.260
AUDIENCE: Does it
ever happen when

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:38.926
you're playing a game
that at some point

00:15:38.926 --> 00:15:41.206
you just feel like it's
just not working out,

00:15:41.206 --> 00:15:42.080
and then you give up?

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:45.217
Or is it the coach who is
constantly telling you?

00:15:45.217 --> 00:15:46.550
ANA IVANOVIC: I blame the coach.

00:15:49.161 --> 00:15:49.660
No.

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:52.500
Yeah, definitely
during the match

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.740
you sort of experience
many different emotions

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:56.440
and feelings.

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:59.290
And I never give up,
but sometimes you

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:02.740
get really frustrated, and
then you want it even more.

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:06.260
And the more you want it,
the further it gets from you.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.170
So it's like a catch-22.

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:11.584
So it's just very important
to try and stay in the moment.

00:16:11.584 --> 00:16:13.250
AUDIENCE: Sort of a
two-folded question,

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:15.720
but one, as you ascend
the rankings again,

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:17.460
have you changed
anything in your style?

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:19.170
You mentioned your
racket and the strings

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:20.820
have basically stayed the same.

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:22.440
And two, there's
been a lot of talk

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.160
about the gluten-free diet.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.110
And I think you tried
it at one point in time.

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:27.651
What were the things
that you learned

00:16:27.651 --> 00:16:29.190
from that experience
that worked,

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:31.010
and some things that
may not have worked?

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:34.479
But I'm curious if you changed
how you eat to prepare.

00:16:34.479 --> 00:16:36.270
I know you've been on
tour for a long time.

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:39.500
And two, if you're changing your
strategy to a certain extent

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.581
to deal with today's
power tennis.

00:16:41.581 --> 00:16:43.580
ANA IVANOVIC: Yeah, that's
a very good question.

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:47.320
Actually, to perform
on such a high level,

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:49.465
you actually have
to tweak everything.

00:16:49.465 --> 00:16:55.070
You can't let anything
hang in the air.

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:56.670
You have to sort of
prepare yourself,

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:58.740
and do the fitness,
do the tennis.

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:01.980
And also nutrition, it's
such a big part of it.

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:05.060
Because like I said, tennis
has developed so much,

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:06.434
it's so much
stronger and faster.

00:17:06.434 --> 00:17:08.410
So recovery is very important.

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:10.609
And nutrition is
a big part of it.

00:17:10.609 --> 00:17:14.819
So I do take, for example,
like, is a tonic something

00:17:14.819 --> 00:17:17.260
that will help me stay
hydrated during my matches?

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.060
Use gels for energy and so on.

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:22.760
I do try still to
eat gluten free,

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:26.000
and if I have opportunities
so I eat a lot of rice,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.589
and protein is very important.

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:30.079
I do like meat, and eat
a lot of meat and fish

00:17:30.079 --> 00:17:31.120
and all kinds of protein.

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:37.000
But yeah, I try to stay
off the dairy so much.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.280
I try to carb load
the day before I play.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.670
ANA IVANOVIC: And then, like
I said, before my matches,

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:45.300
I also try to eat
light, but still some

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:48.820
carbs that will give me
energy for the match.

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.960
AUDIENCE: Do you find
that over the years,

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:54.130
do you come to a period where
you just feel burned out?

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:56.130
Or do you feel like
every time you play,

00:17:56.130 --> 00:18:00.820
you're just like, happy
to play and glad to play?

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:02.670
ANA IVANOVIC: Well,
there is definitely

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:05.990
times where I wish
I was on holiday,

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:08.040
and I don't want to be on court.

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.500
But I think it's normal.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.120
I'm sure not every
day you look forward

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:16.020
to the day in the office.

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:18.210
Everyone goes
through these phases,

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:20.830
and we do compete a lot,
and we travel a lot.

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:23.910
So it does-- it's very
stressful on the body and mind.

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:26.990
And all the pressures that come
along, and other activities we

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:27.690
have to do.

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:30.200
So it's very important
to find this balance

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:34.270
between working hard, competing,
and then also resting.

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:37.610
And that's why we have
to make smart schedules,

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:41.350
and give body and mind a rest.

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:43.870
Even when sometimes-- in
the beginning of the year,

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:45.200
I was four months on the road.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:48.040
And it's very hard, you don't
see your family, friends

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.480
and it's a constant
competition and pressure.

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.520
So whenever I have
a day or two off,

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:56.380
I really try to do something
different to engage in.

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:59.010
Sightseeing, just to get
your mind off tennis.

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:01.930
And that's a little
trick that we

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:06.460
try to do so we can
stay motivated on court.

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:09.080
AUDIENCE: What's one
lesson, or one thing you've

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.770
learned throughout
your 11 years on tour,

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:13.050
that's really helped you?

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:16.000
Throughout the 11 years-- you
stayed playing for 11 years?

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.900
ANA IVANOVIC: Well, when I
was about 11 or 12 years old,

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:24.210
my coach at the time
in Serbia told me,

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:26.435
it has to be hard
on practice courts,

00:19:26.435 --> 00:19:28.350
so it's easier
during the matches.

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:30.080
And it stayed with
me, and it's so true.

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:33.020
Because you really have to work
so much harder on the court,

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:37.592
so then when you play matches
it's just a piece of cake.

00:19:37.592 --> 00:19:38.550
JONAS: All right, nice.

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:39.091
Thanks, guys.

00:19:39.091 --> 00:19:41.450
So we have a little
present for Ana,

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:45.320
and [INAUDIBLE] now is going
to come and get that out.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.560
Also want to say super,
super big thanks to Tracy,

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.269
[INAUDIBLE], and Stacy
today for all their work.

00:19:51.269 --> 00:19:52.602
ANA IVANOVIC: Thank you so much.

00:19:52.602 --> 00:19:55.518
Thank you, guys.

00:19:55.518 --> 00:19:57.091
That's very nice.

00:19:57.091 --> 00:19:58.840
JONAS: And then you
get some more practice

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:01.756
at tossing the ball, practice.

00:20:01.756 --> 00:20:02.630
So anywhere you like.

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:04.806
So, we have some
signed balls from Ana.

00:20:07.891 --> 00:20:08.390
Nice.

00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:12.210
All right.

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:13.626
ANA IVANOVIC: OK,
I'll go further.

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:19.739
JONAS: And the last one.

00:20:19.739 --> 00:20:20.685
Oh no!

00:20:23.523 --> 00:20:25.650
STACY SULLIVAN: And we wish
you good luck tomorrow,

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:26.570
in the match.

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:27.700
JONAS: All right, well
thanks for coming.

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:28.700
ANA IVANOVIC: Thank you.

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:33.760
Thank you for having me.
