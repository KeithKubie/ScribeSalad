00:00:13.836 --> 00:00:16.436
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Movement in
art integrate with learning

00:00:16.436 --> 00:00:19.466
at the John Moore School
in Sacramento, California,

00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:23.576
one of the first Waldorf-inspired
public schools.

00:00:25.306 --> 00:00:28.326
&gt;&gt;Cheryl: Running through the
mud, digging with their shovels,

00:00:28.326 --> 00:00:33.546
and singing to the teacher and
really speak to Waldorf Education.

00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:37.956
It's always about stimulating
the creativity

00:00:37.986 --> 00:00:39.556
and imagination of the child.

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:43.556
What Waldorf methods are,
essentially, is an integration

00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:46.866
of the arts into regular
curricular areas.

00:00:47.176 --> 00:00:50.706
&gt;&gt;Izabelle: With one, like sometimes
we draw pictures, when we're done

00:00:50.706 --> 00:00:53.206
with this, she puts
a letter inside some,

00:00:53.206 --> 00:00:57.086
and we try to figure out the letter.

00:00:57.856 --> 00:01:00.076
&gt;&gt;Teacher: These are
first-grade main lesson books.

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:02.766
Where the princess was
surrounded by faeries,

00:01:03.676 --> 00:01:08.306
the faeries that surround the
princes turned into the letter F.

00:01:08.406 --> 00:01:11.136
And in this way, the
children's imagination is woken

00:01:11.136 --> 00:01:12.826
up to the entire world.

00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:16.896
&gt;&gt;Barbara: We have apples that we
cut in half to find five seeds.

00:01:17.526 --> 00:01:19.876
We traced our hands
with five fingers.

00:01:19.876 --> 00:01:24.276
We saw the five-pointed stars,
so that we had science integrated

00:01:24.736 --> 00:01:27.566
with nature studies, and geometry

00:01:27.956 --> 00:01:32.576
and artistic work before
it ever led to mathematics.

00:01:32.956 --> 00:01:33.076
&gt;&gt;Students: Five!

00:01:34.276 --> 00:01:34.386
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Good.

00:01:34.976 --> 00:01:36.976
Who wants to do the backwards one?

00:01:37.116 --> 00:01:42.506
Severin? Here it comes.

00:01:43.856 --> 00:01:44.106
&gt;&gt;Students: Ten!

00:01:44.106 --> 00:01:45.056
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Good work, first grade!

00:01:45.056 --> 00:01:48.146
Who wants to...

00:01:48.146 --> 00:01:52.816
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Kids move to
learn math, and social skills.

00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:54.496
&gt;&gt;Vince: They were
skipping through the room,

00:01:54.496 --> 00:01:55.966
following each other
around in a chain.

00:01:56.256 --> 00:01:59.256
It's developing spatial awareness
of what's happening in the room,

00:01:59.526 --> 00:02:00.876
and how they're working as a group.

00:02:00.946 --> 00:02:03.636
&gt;&gt;Taylor: I like the
John Moore School,

00:02:03.636 --> 00:02:09.246
how you get to play instruments,
you get to do hand work,

00:02:09.616 --> 00:02:12.706
movement classes, you get to
do all sorts of extra stuff

00:02:13.016 --> 00:02:14.886
as the schools is going
to allow you to do.

00:02:21.516 --> 00:02:23.686
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For more

00:02:23.686 --> 00:02:27.596
