00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.540
Emotional Intelligence is the quality that
enables us to confront with patience, insight

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.610
and imagination the many problems that we
face in our affective relationship with ourselves

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:20.500
and with others.
The term may sound odd. We are used to referring

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:27.370
to intelligence as a general quality, without
unpicking a particular variety a person might

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:32.369
possess – and therefore we do not tend to
highlight the value of a distinctive sort

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.329
of intelligence which currently does not enjoy
the prestige it should.

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.590
Every sort of intelligence signals an ability
to navigate well around a particular set of

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.880
challenges: mathematical, linguistic, technical,
commercial… When we say that someone is

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.971
clever but add that they have made a mess
of their personal lives; or that they have

00:00:54.971 --> 00:01:01.610
acquired a fortune but are restless and sad
or that they are powerful but intolerant and

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:09.280
unimaginative, we are pointing to a deficit
in what deserves to be called Emotional Intelligence.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.600
In social life, we can feel the presence of
Emotional Intelligence in a sensitivity to

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.970
the moods of others and in a readiness to
grasp the surprising things that may be going

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:27.409
on for them beneath the surface. Emotional
Intelligence recognises a role for interpretation

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:35.460
and knows that a fiery outburst might be a
disguised plea for help, that a political

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:43.119
rant may be provoked by hunger and that concealed
within a forceful jolliness may be a sorrow

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:49.460
that has been sentimentally disavowed.
In relation to ourselves, Emotional Intelligence

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:56.890
shows up in a scepticism around our emotions,
especially those of love, desire, anger, envy,

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:05.340
anxiety and professional ambition. The Emotionally
Intelligent refuse to trust their first impulses

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.790
or the wisdom of their feelings. They know
that hatred may mask love, that anger may

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.069
be a cover for sadness and that we are prone
to huge and costly inaccuracies in whom we

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.950
desire and what we seek.
Emotional Intelligence is also what distinguishes

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.180
those who are crushed by failure from those
who know how to greet the troubles of existence

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:37.030
with a melancholy and at points darkly humorous
resilience. The Emotionally Intelligent appreciate

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.910
the role of well-handled pessimism within
the overall economy of a good life.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:49.770
Emotional Intelligence isn’t an inborn talent.
It’s the result of education, specifically

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:57.980
in how to interpret ourselves, where our emotions
arise from, how our childhoods influence us

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:04.769
and how we might best navigate our fears and
wishes. In the utopia, it would be routine

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:10.800
to be taught Emotional Intelligence from the
youngest age, before we had had the opportunity

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.290
to make too many mistakes.
It is because we have - until now - not taken

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:21.220
Emotional Education seriously enough that
our species has grown ever more technically

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.709
adept while retaining the level of wisdom
of our earliest days; with catastrophic results.

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:34.450
We are evolved monkeys with nuclear weapons.
It appears that the fate of civilisation now

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:41.300
depends on our capacity to master the mechanisms
of Emotional Education before it is too late.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:47.400
Emotional Education extends far beyond formal
education as we have conceived of it to date.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.569
Though it should ideally include specialised
courses in every year of school or college,

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.379
Emotional Education is more than something
that should take place in classrooms at the

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:00.360
hands of teachers and come to a halt around
the age of twenty-one.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:06.330
The central vehicle for the transfer of Emotional
Intelligence is culture, from its highest

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.610
to its most popular level. Culture is the
field that can ritualise and consistently

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:17.970
promote the absorption of wisdom. The 'lessons'
of culture might be embedded in a tragedy

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:24.210
or a TV series, a pop song or a novel, a work
of architecture or a YouTube film. We can

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:30.369
envisage the entire apparatus of culture as
a subtle mechanism designed to point us towards

00:04:30.369 --> 00:04:35.069
greater emotional intelligence.
We will never progress as a species, and will

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:41.349
indeed grow into ever greater technologically-armed
menaces to ourselves, until we have accepted

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:48.559
the challenges and opportunities of properly educating our selves in Emotional Intelligence.

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:56.550
Our Technical Intelligence is great of course.  It's led us to tame
nature and conquer this planet. But a wiser, saner

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:04.699
future for the race must depend on a capacity
to master and then seductively teach the rudiments

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.560
of Emotional Intelligence - while there 
is still time.
