00:00:12.944 --> 00:00:15.318
So I'm a professional poker player,

00:00:15.342 --> 00:00:20.612
and today, I want to talk about
three things that the game has taught me

00:00:20.636 --> 00:00:24.464
around decision-making
that I find apply to everyday life.

00:00:25.061 --> 00:00:27.852
Now the first of these things
is about luck.

00:00:27.876 --> 00:00:32.714
Now, like poker, life is also
a game of skill and luck,

00:00:32.738 --> 00:00:35.416
and when it comes
to the biggest things we care about --

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.217
health, wealth and relationships --

00:00:38.241 --> 00:00:42.075
these outcomes don't only depend
on the quality of our decision-making,

00:00:42.099 --> 00:00:43.844
but also the roll of life's dice.

00:00:43.868 --> 00:00:46.855
For example, we can be
perfectly health-conscious

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.249
and still get unlucky
with something like cancer.

00:00:50.273 --> 00:00:53.392
Or we can smoke 20 a day
and live to a ripe old age,

00:00:53.416 --> 00:00:56.939
and this kind of ambiguity
can make it hard for us to know

00:00:56.963 --> 00:00:59.559
how good our strategies are, sometimes,

00:00:59.583 --> 00:01:02.471
especially when we're
experiencing a lot of success.

00:01:03.043 --> 00:01:04.877
For example, back in 2010,

00:01:04.901 --> 00:01:08.885
I won a really big poker tournament
known as the European Poker Tour.

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.251
And because I'd only been playing
full-time for about a year,

00:01:12.275 --> 00:01:15.170
when I won, I assumed
I must be rather brilliant.

00:01:16.106 --> 00:01:17.948
In fact, I thought I was so brilliant

00:01:17.972 --> 00:01:21.416
that I not only got rather lazy
with studying the game,

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.090
but I also got more risky,

00:01:23.114 --> 00:01:26.122
started playing in
the biggest tournaments I could

00:01:26.146 --> 00:01:28.661
against the very best in the world.

00:01:28.685 --> 00:01:32.177
And then my profit graph went
from a thing of beauty

00:01:32.201 --> 00:01:34.613
to something kind of sad,

00:01:34.637 --> 00:01:36.997
with this worrying
downhill trend for a long time,

00:01:37.021 --> 00:01:40.486
until I finally realized
that I was overestimating my skill level,

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.001
and got my act together.

00:01:42.525 --> 00:01:45.042
And this kind of reminds me
of what we've been seeing

00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:47.812
in the cryptocurrency space,
at least in 2017,

00:01:47.836 --> 00:01:51.425
where the only thing that's been going up
faster than the markets themselves

00:01:51.449 --> 00:01:53.926
is the number of "senior
investment specialists"

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.338
who have been appearing out of nowhere.

00:01:56.362 --> 00:01:59.328
Now I'm not saying it's not possible
to have a strategic edge,

00:01:59.352 --> 00:02:02.432
but at the same time,
it's very easy to feel like a genius

00:02:02.456 --> 00:02:04.868
when you're in a market
that's going up so fast

00:02:04.892 --> 00:02:07.298
that even the worst strategies
are making a profit.

00:02:07.322 --> 00:02:09.631
So when we're experiencing success,

00:02:09.655 --> 00:02:12.512
it's important to take a moment
to really ask ourselves

00:02:12.536 --> 00:02:15.168
how much of it is truly down to us,

00:02:15.192 --> 00:02:19.684
because our egos love to downplay
the luck factor when we're winning.

00:02:21.058 --> 00:02:23.239
Now, a second thing poker taught me

00:02:23.263 --> 00:02:26.606
is the importance
of quantifying my thinking.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.529
When you're playing,
you can't just get away with going,

00:02:29.553 --> 00:02:31.232
"Eh, they're probably bluffing."

00:02:31.256 --> 00:02:33.480
That's just going to lose you
a bunch of money,

00:02:33.504 --> 00:02:36.703
because poker is a game
of probabilities and precision,

00:02:36.727 --> 00:02:40.223
and so you have to train yourself
to think in numbers.

00:02:40.247 --> 00:02:42.429
So now, whenever I catch myself

00:02:42.453 --> 00:02:46.002
thinking vaguely about something
really important, like,

00:02:46.026 --> 00:02:49.251
"It's unlikely I'll forget
what I want to say in my TED Talk,"

00:02:49.275 --> 00:02:51.966
I now try to estimate it numerically.

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:53.820
(Laughter)

00:02:53.844 --> 00:02:56.318
Trust me, it helps a lot
with the planning process.

00:02:56.342 --> 00:02:59.762
And the thing is, almost anything
that could possibly happen here today,

00:02:59.786 --> 00:03:01.341
or at any point in the future,

00:03:01.365 --> 00:03:03.661
can also be expressed
as a probability, too.

00:03:04.333 --> 00:03:07.048
(Laughter)

00:03:07.072 --> 00:03:10.477
So now I also try to speak
in numbers as well.

00:03:10.501 --> 00:03:11.652
So if someone asks me,

00:03:11.676 --> 00:03:15.191
"Hey, Liv, do you think you're going
to come along to that thing tonight?"

00:03:15.215 --> 00:03:17.532
instead of just saying to them,
"Yeah, probably,"

00:03:17.556 --> 00:03:19.384
I actually give them my best estimate --

00:03:19.408 --> 00:03:21.250
say, 60 percent.

00:03:21.274 --> 00:03:23.377
Because -- I know that sounds
a little odd --

00:03:23.401 --> 00:03:26.473
but the thing is, I ran a poll on Twitter

00:03:26.497 --> 00:03:29.061
of what people understand
the word "probably" to mean,

00:03:29.085 --> 00:03:30.833
and this was the spread of answers.

00:03:30.857 --> 00:03:32.008
Enormous!

00:03:32.032 --> 00:03:33.865
So apparently, it's absolutely useless

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:36.584
at actually conveying
any real information.

00:03:36.608 --> 00:03:40.249
So if you guys catch yourselves
using these vague words,

00:03:40.273 --> 00:03:43.169
like "probably" or "sometimes,"

00:03:43.193 --> 00:03:46.392
try, instead, using numbers,
because when we speak in numbers,

00:03:46.416 --> 00:03:48.812
we know what lands
in the other person's brain.

00:03:50.092 --> 00:03:53.782
Now, the third thing I want
to touch on today is intuition.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.926
How often have you seen
these kinds of inspirational memes

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.433
in your Facebook feed?

00:04:01.018 --> 00:04:03.741
[Always trust your gut feeling
and never second-guess.]

00:04:03.765 --> 00:04:05.026
They're nice, right?

00:04:05.726 --> 00:04:08.351
It's lovely. Yes. "Trust your soul."

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.903
Well, they're terrible advice.

00:04:11.292 --> 00:04:14.762
These are some of the best
poker players in the world right now.

00:04:14.786 --> 00:04:19.247
Do they look like people who live
purely off feelings and intuitions?

00:04:19.271 --> 00:04:20.272
(Laughter)

00:04:20.296 --> 00:04:21.945
Look at them!

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:26.549
Obviously, these guys
are about slow, careful analysis,

00:04:26.573 --> 00:04:29.080
and that's because the game
has outgrown the days

00:04:29.104 --> 00:04:32.112
where pure street smarts
and people-reading

00:04:32.136 --> 00:04:33.957
can get you to the top.

00:04:33.981 --> 00:04:37.283
And that's because our intuitions
aren't nearly as perfect

00:04:37.307 --> 00:04:38.577
as we'd like to believe.

00:04:38.601 --> 00:04:41.143
I mean, it'd be great,
whenever we're in a tough spot,

00:04:41.167 --> 00:04:45.173
to just have an answer appear to us
from some magical source of inspiration.

00:04:45.197 --> 00:04:48.595
But in reality, our gut
is extremely vulnerable

00:04:48.619 --> 00:04:52.054
to all kinds of wishful
thinking and biases.

00:04:52.905 --> 00:04:55.104
So then, what is our gut good for?

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:57.200
Well, all the studies I've read

00:04:57.224 --> 00:05:01.171
conclude that it's best-suited
for everyday things

00:05:01.195 --> 00:05:03.584
that we have lots
and lots of experience in,

00:05:03.608 --> 00:05:06.338
like how we just know
that our friend is mad at us

00:05:06.362 --> 00:05:08.409
before we've even said anything to them,

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:11.585
or whether we can fit our car
into a tight parking spot.

00:05:11.609 --> 00:05:13.697
But when it comes to the really big stuff,

00:05:13.721 --> 00:05:16.245
like what's our career path going to be

00:05:16.269 --> 00:05:17.951
or who should we marry,

00:05:17.975 --> 00:05:21.500
why should we assume that our intuitions

00:05:21.524 --> 00:05:25.226
are better calibrated for these
than slow, proper analysis?

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.710
I mean, they don't have
any data to be based off.

00:05:28.528 --> 00:05:32.306
So my third lesson is,
while we shouldn't ignore our intuitions,

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.703
we shouldn't overprivilege them either.

00:05:34.727 --> 00:05:37.155
And I'd like to summarize
these three lessons today

00:05:37.179 --> 00:05:38.807
with my own set of memes,

00:05:38.831 --> 00:05:40.886
with more of a poker-player twist.

00:05:41.957 --> 00:05:46.092
"Success is sweetest when you achieve it
across a large sample size."

00:05:46.116 --> 00:05:47.854
(Laughter)

00:05:47.878 --> 00:05:52.298
"Your gut is your friend
and so is a cost-benefit analysis.

00:05:52.322 --> 00:05:53.555
(Laughter)

00:05:53.579 --> 00:05:58.222
"The future is unknown, but you can
damn well try and estimate it."

00:05:58.246 --> 00:05:59.397
Thank you.

00:05:59.421 --> 00:06:06.087
(Applause)
