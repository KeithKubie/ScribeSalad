[Intro music plays]

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.300
Mitch: Hello, and welcome to The Lab, where we take your questions and turn them into experiments

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.300
My name is Mitch,

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:13.820
Greg: And I'm Greg,

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.200
and today, we're gonna be conquering one of our greatest fears, which is the fear of height.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.680
Mitch: Specifically, we're gonna be climbing one of the tallest free-standing structures in the western hemisphere

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.300
and finding out what would happen if we fall off.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.300
Greg: The fear of height is also known as acrophobia,

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.720
and the symptoms include dizziness, nausea, shaking...

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.920
So we're gonna test these things on ourselves by going up to CN Tower,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.540
going outside of it, and walking around the edge.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.320
Mitch: The CN Tower is an iconic part of the Toronto skyline and stands 553 metres high.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.040
Greg: It's also Drake's favourite chair.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.740
The long, pointy antenna portion was actually made up of 26 pieces, each which were brought up by a helicopter.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.540
Mitch: But where we'll be completing our edge walk is on the top of the main pod,

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:00.340
which is 356 metres above the ground and is the highest external walk of a building in the world.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.060
Greg: For reference, it would be like stacking the White House on top of itelf approximately 17 times,

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.520
and then walking around on top.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.560
[music]

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.220
Greg: How you feeling, Mitch?

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.960
Mitch: I'm nervous. That's what we're going on right in a couple of seconds, and I realise I have a fear of heights all of a sudden.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.240
Greg: I'm not nervous but seeing it when I got here, I'm scared. But I'm not scared at all.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.700
Mitch: Yeah, you're scared. I know you are. You're just kinda being a [talking too fast to be understood]

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:31.200
Our brains are basically anticipation machines and we use information from our past, and our current state, and our environment to help predict the future,

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.120
which, ultimately, helps us stay alive.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.400
Greg: Mitch is signing away his life.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.560
Hopefully you don't fall off!

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.840
Mitch: But, when you don't have any experience with the thing that you're anticipating,

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.200
like, I've never been hundreds of metres in the air walking on an edge that I can DIE off of,

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.740
then your fear goes up and so does your fight-or-flight behaviour.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.880
I thought you weren't nervous?

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.720
Greg: I'm not.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.400
Mitch: So I have to pee, because, obviously, I'm getting nervous and

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.300
I'm freaking out. My bladder is like, "Let loose!".

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.960
Lady: You guys look good! You look like... you looking beautiful!

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.540
Greg: A lot of our fears stem out of learned experiences or traumatic events that have happened to us

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.920
but the fear of heights is said to be much more common in people and it's actually something that we're born with.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.300
Mitch: When we go up the elevators, I go freak out.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.820
Greg: I don't feel anything. I actually don't because it just feels like I'm just wearing a cool suit.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.020
Scientists have actually used studies and experiments with visual cliffs,

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.720
and they study domestic animals and toddlers and found that at a very young age,

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.140
they're very cautious around these cliffs, showing that the fear of heights is something that we're born with.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.600
I've got adrenaline; this is good.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.780
I'm also, like, "Where's my helmet?"

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.140
I mean, it makes sense that the fear of heights is natural and something that we're born with,

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.660
because it protects ourselves and makes us live longer so that we don't walk off cliffs or walk off the CN Tower.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.620
Guide: Hey, Greg, come check it out!

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.060
Greg: [screaming]

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.740
I'm shaking now and I'm feeling kind of sick - that is crazy!

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:50.240
Mitch: Woah!

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.720
Greg: But, this can hold 15 and a half thousand pounds so we're hoping that we're fine.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:56.480
Greg: How's it going?

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.520
Mitch: Ugh... (anxious)

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.020
Guide: The third, yep, right there. Push your rope all the way all the way out in front of you

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.560
and then lean forward in that room.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.240
Mitch: Ahhhh...

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.500
Guide: Keep going, all the way forward.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.820
Excellent, and then you can let go!

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.640
Awesome job, Mitch!

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.280
Alright! Yeah! Go up on your toes.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.840
Mitch: Ahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.040
Guide: Excellent!

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:29.960
[Music]

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:35.480
Greg: Okay, so this is amazing, horrifying, and I'm freaking out but imagine if you fell - what would happen?

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:43.420
Mitch: Well, a 77 kilogram person falling from 356 metres would reach speeds of up to 300 kilometres an hour

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.940
and reach the bottom in under 9 seconds.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.340
That is, without any drag or force acting opposite to the relative motion of a moving object.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.880
Top terminal velocities for human skydivers are lower because of air resistence,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
around 195 kilometres an hour when facing stomach to earth,

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.700
and they don't reach this speed until around 12 seconds or after travelling 450 metres.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.460
Either way, it wouldn't take long to hit the bottom.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.400
Greg: It's no surprise that you likely wouldn't survive this fall, although some humans have lived to tell the tale

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.500
after falling from very high heights.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.120
In fact, there's actually been reports of people falling from over 5,000 metres,

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.280
mostly during the war, so out of burning airplanes, but they landed on pine trees, or soft snow or glass roofs

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.880
and they also had a lot of injuries.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:33.580
Mitch: It ultimately depends on if the surface you land on has high deformity, like snow, then your chances for survival increase.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.660
Mitch and Greg: Okayyyyy.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.900
Greg: I feel less dizzy and scared now.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.760
Mitch: I feel more confident now that we've had some time

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.200
to spend staring; it kind of becomes normal after a while.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.480
Greg: Yeah, and now, I'm like, "What's that? What's that?"

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.740
Mitch: But, everytime I have to go on the edge I'm still in genuine fear.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.220
Greg: And it's the toes over the edge that makes me want to throw up.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.760
Mitch: It was a crazy experience but super cool, we're so glad we did it. Conquered a fear!

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.460
Guide: Awesome job, Greg! Well done, Mitch!

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:08.760
