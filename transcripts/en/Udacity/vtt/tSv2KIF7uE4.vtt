You've seen many different examples of page structures, but we haven't explored

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.300
how the browser knows what style to apply and where that style comes from.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.310
Let's take a deeper look at how it all works together.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:19.450
HTML is the language of the Web and it has a specific syntax and rules.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.630
You write HTML in a document just like you would regular text,

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.420
except you follow HTML syntax and rules rather then general grammatical rules.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.120
The basic word in the language of HTML is a tag.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.330
The browser turns HTML tags into elements that form a tree.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:45.180
It knows how to do that because of the document object model, or DOM, which

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.810
is a standard convention for representing and interacting with elements in HTML.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.560
So, the tree you saw in developer tools was really the DOM tree that

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.280
the browser built from an HTML document.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.390
Each HTML tag creates an element in the DOM that the browser uses to

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.750
display the page.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.070
An element is created from the starting tag to the ending tag, and

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.690
everything in between is content.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.110
The content can be empty, it can be text, or it can be another element.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:23.230
Each tag has a name or type that defines what kind of element will be created.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.330
Will it be a paragraph?

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.330
An image?

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.115
Or just a document division?

00:01:28.115 --> 00:01:29.770
Block.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.280
Each tag can also have attributes with values.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.900
For example, here we have an h1 tag

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:44.110
with a class attribute and a value of that attribute of article.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:50.560
The document written in HTML defines the structure and content of the page.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.450
To define the style, you have to use another language, CSS.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.700
CSS allows you to use a specific syntax and

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.160
rules to change how elements look on the page, the size of the font,

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.600
the color, background, borders, position, and on and on.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.800
For example, you can use CSS to say all h1 elements

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.690
that belong to the class article should have the text color dark blue.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.430
To tie structure and style together, the HTML document can provide

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.450
the browser with information on what style to use and where to get it.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.010
Since there are specific rules for how these elements work,

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.500
once you know the language, you can look at the HTML code and get a pretty

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.240
good understanding of how the page is organized and what it can look like.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.290
And it works the other way around too.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.750
You can see how a page looks and get an idea of how you can break it

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.740
down into different elements, which is what we're going to do next.
