00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.050
We're asked to
fill in the blanks

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:04.460
to complete the equation.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.660
So they have 86.93
is equal to 5 tens

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:13.490
plus blank ones plus 9
tenths plus 3 hundredths.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.200
So let me expand out
86.93 and just think

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.920
about how I could regroup the
value in the different places

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.515
so that I get
something more close

00:00:20.515 --> 00:00:23.520
or exactly what we have
on the right-hand side.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.440
So the 8 in 86.93,
that's in the tens place.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.940
So it literally
represents 8 tens.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.000
So I can write that down as 80.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.160
The 6 in 86 represents 6 ones.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.520
So I can write that down as 6.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.100
Then the 9 in 86.93,
that's 9 tenths.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.270
So I could write that down.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.420
I could write this 9.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.610
That's right of
the decimal place.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.190
This is plus 9 tenths.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.760
And then the 3 in 86.93, that
is in the hundredths place.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.510
It represents 3 hundredths.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.780
So this is plus 3 over 100.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.060
So I've expanded out the
number that I have on the left.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.840
Now let me write out what
they have on the right again.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.520
So this is going to be equal
to-- they have 5 tens here.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.510
So I'll write all the tens
places in this red color.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.470
Then they have blank ones.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.680
So I'm just going to
literally write out

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.630
a blank plus 9 tenths.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.620
So the 9 tenths is still 9
tenths plus 3 hundredths.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.820
So let me make sure
that we color code this.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.610
So that's the 9 tenths.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.250
This is the 5 tens.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.710
That's the 50.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.770
We have the blank ones.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.990
That's this right
over here, 9 tenths.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:56.780
And then finally we have the 3
hundredths, so plus 3 over 100.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.680
So how do we get
the right-hand side

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.780
to be the exact same thing
as the left-hand side

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.320
by adjusting this blank?

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.300
Well, both sides
have a 3/100 on it,

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.020
both sides have a 9/10 on it.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.000
And so what's really different
about the two sides is

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.775
on the left-hand
side-- let me do

00:02:14.775 --> 00:02:16.970
this in a color we
can actually see.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.710
On the left-hand side
you have an 80 plus a 6.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.740
On the right-hand side you
have a 50 plus a blank.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.910
So 80 plus 6 is clearly 86.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.566
Well, what has to be
added to 50 to get to 86?

00:02:33.566 --> 00:02:34.607
Well, you have to add 36.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.370
So now both sides add
up to the same thing.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.980
80 plus 6 is 86.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.680
50 plus 36 is 86.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.520
Then you have 9/10,
9/10, 3/100, 3/100.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.110
Now, you might be saying, hey
wait, you wrote a 36 here.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.330
Does this literally
means 36 ones?

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.730
And I will say yes, it
literally represents 36 ones.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.600
This is the same
thing as 36 times 1.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.090
So we can fill in
the blank here.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.040
86.93 is equal to
5 tens plus 36 ones

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.272
plus 9 tenths plus 3 hundredths.

00:03:15.272 --> 00:03:16.730
And I encourage
you to add this up.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.390
You will get 86.93.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.040
Now, what have we
essentially done here?

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.520
What we essentially did, if you
compare the 8 and the 5 right

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:33.980
over here, you see that we
took 3 from the tens place.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.530
But taking 3 from the
tens place is essentially

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.200
taking 30 from the value
that it represents.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.070
So we took 30 from
the tens place,

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.660
and we gave that 30
to the ones place.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.660
So you had 86.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.490
You take 30 away, you
have 50 in the tens place,

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.150
represented by this 5.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.060
And then you give that 30 to
the ones place, you have 36.

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.799
You have 36 ones.
