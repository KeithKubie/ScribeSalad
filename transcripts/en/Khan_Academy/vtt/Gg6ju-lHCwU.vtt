00:00:00.476 --> 00:00:02.208
- [Voiceover] The world Islam can best be

00:00:02.208 --> 00:00:04.958
translated into English
as meaning surrender,

00:00:04.958 --> 00:00:07.200
and the context of the Islamic faith

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.116
is referring to a surrender
to the will of God.

00:00:11.116 --> 00:00:14.866
Now, a Muslim is someone
who practices Islam,

00:00:15.887 --> 00:00:19.008
one who submits to the will of God,

00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:22.769
and the central text
in Islam is the Quran,

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.903
which Muslims believe is
the revealed knowledge

00:00:25.903 --> 00:00:30.070
or the revealed words of God
through the messenger Muhammad.

00:00:31.747 --> 00:00:32.998
Now, it's very important,

00:00:32.998 --> 00:00:36.144
sometimes, especially in older
texts, older western texts,

00:00:36.144 --> 00:00:39.622
you might see Islam
referred to as Muhammadism

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:42.788
the same way that
Christianity refers to Christ.

00:00:42.788 --> 00:00:44.652
Now, Muslims are very sensitive to this,

00:00:44.652 --> 00:00:48.504
because they don't view
Muhammad as a divine figure

00:00:48.504 --> 00:00:50.941
the way that Christians view Christ.

00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:53.771
They view Muhammad as a human,

00:00:53.771 --> 00:00:57.858
a human whose practices
and whose life they view,

00:00:57.858 --> 00:01:02.361
they revere, but they don't
view him as a divine figure.

00:01:02.361 --> 00:01:03.492
They view him as the messenger

00:01:03.492 --> 00:01:07.417
who revealed God's
words through the Quran,

00:01:07.417 --> 00:01:11.261
and they take this so seriously
in most Muslim traditions,

00:01:11.261 --> 00:01:13.656
they don't create images of Muhammad

00:01:13.656 --> 00:01:16.131
for fear that people would start to

00:01:16.131 --> 00:01:19.600
worship it as some type of an idol.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.433
Now, on this timeline,

00:01:22.618 --> 00:01:26.826
you see other significant
Judeo-Christian figures,

00:01:26.826 --> 00:01:29.430
and that's because according to Muslims,

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.993
they are following in the same
tradition of these figures.

00:01:32.993 --> 00:01:34.934
They view these other figures as people

00:01:34.934 --> 00:01:37.738
who have submitted to the will of God,

00:01:37.738 --> 00:01:39.775
and Moses and Jesus in particular

00:01:39.775 --> 00:01:43.942
are the most frequently
mentioned prophets in the Quran.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.420
Now, Muslims also believe that the Quran

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.449
isn't the first book that
God had revealed to mankind.

00:01:52.449 --> 00:01:54.544
They also believe that the Torah,

00:01:54.544 --> 00:01:57.037
which is the first five
books of the Hebrew bible,

00:01:57.037 --> 00:01:58.586
and also the first five books of

00:01:58.586 --> 00:02:00.124
the Christian Old Testament,

00:02:00.124 --> 00:02:03.045
Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus,
Numbers, and Deuteronomy,

00:02:03.045 --> 00:02:06.481
they believe that to be
a revealed text from God

00:02:06.481 --> 00:02:08.648
through the prophet Moses.

00:02:10.227 --> 00:02:14.637
They also believe that Psalms
is a revealed text from God

00:02:14.637 --> 00:02:18.045
through King David, so
through the prophet David,

00:02:18.045 --> 00:02:20.148
who lived around 1000 BCE,

00:02:20.148 --> 00:02:22.672
and they think that the Gospel

00:02:22.672 --> 00:02:26.407
is a revealed message through Jesus.

00:02:26.407 --> 00:02:28.930
Now, above and beyond
these revealed texts,

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.653
another significant part of
the Muslim tradition or faith

00:02:31.653 --> 00:02:34.941
are the notions of Sunnah and Hadith,

00:02:34.941 --> 00:02:38.034
and Sunnah are the practices and life

00:02:38.034 --> 00:02:39.946
and sayings of Muhammad,

00:02:39.946 --> 00:02:42.497
and many of them are
accounted for in the Hadith.

00:02:42.497 --> 00:02:45.192
Hadith are second hand
accounts of other people

00:02:45.192 --> 00:02:47.230
who lived at the time of Muhammad,

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.138
although many of them were written decades

00:02:49.138 --> 00:02:50.841
or sometimes hundreds of years later,

00:02:50.841 --> 00:02:53.076
and so it is a debate
in the Muslim community

00:02:53.076 --> 00:02:55.133
on which Hadiths are considered

00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:56.921
more trustworthy than others.

00:02:56.921 --> 00:02:59.786
The one commonality, regardless of sect,

00:02:59.786 --> 00:03:02.149
is a centrality of the Quran

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:06.434
and viewing that as
the actual word of God.

00:03:06.434 --> 00:03:09.051
To see this a little bit more concretely

00:03:09.051 --> 00:03:11.953
in terms of how much
Muslims view themselves

00:03:11.953 --> 00:03:14.217
as the same tradition that we see

00:03:14.217 --> 00:03:16.961
from the Old and New Testament,

00:03:16.961 --> 00:03:19.378
here are some Quranic quotes,

00:03:20.871 --> 00:03:22.686
and the first one essentially speaks to

00:03:22.686 --> 00:03:25.984
this core idea of being
in that same tradition.

00:03:25.984 --> 00:03:28.591
"He has ordained for you of religion

00:03:28.591 --> 00:03:30.627
"what He enjoined upon Noah

00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:33.348
"and that which we have
revealed to you, O Muhammad,

00:03:33.348 --> 00:03:37.474
"and what we enjoined upon
Abraham and Moses and Jesus,

00:03:37.474 --> 00:03:41.641
"to establish the religion
and not be divided therein."

00:03:42.744 --> 00:03:46.414
And this is speaking to
the importance of Abraham.

00:03:46.414 --> 00:03:47.906
"And who is better in religion than

00:03:47.906 --> 00:03:51.899
"one who submits himself to
God while being a doer of good

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:54.074
"and follows the religion of Abraham,

00:03:54.074 --> 00:03:56.087
"inclining toward truth?

00:03:56.087 --> 00:03:59.070
"And God took Abraham as a friend."

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.677
And Abraham in particular
plays a very central role.

00:04:02.677 --> 00:04:05.849
The Kaaba, which Muslims
view as the house of God,

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:08.749
based in Mecca, right over here,

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:12.749
is viewed as being built
by Abraham and Ishmael,

00:04:13.868 --> 00:04:16.821
and so Medina, which is
where in future videos

00:04:16.821 --> 00:04:18.098
we'll talk more about,

00:04:18.098 --> 00:04:21.671
where the early Muslims sought
exile to escape persecution,

00:04:21.671 --> 00:04:24.136
that's often viewed as
the city of Muhammad,

00:04:24.136 --> 00:04:26.175
but Mecca, which is the direction

00:04:26.175 --> 00:04:28.521
that all Muslims pray in during

00:04:28.521 --> 00:04:31.678
their ritual five times a day prayer,

00:04:31.678 --> 00:04:32.965
which we'll talk about in a little bit,

00:04:32.965 --> 00:04:37.274
that's often referred to
as the city of Abraham.

00:04:37.274 --> 00:04:39.904
And now here is reference to Moses.

00:04:39.904 --> 00:04:42.409
"And before it was the scripture of Moses

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:44.311
"to lead and as a mercy.

00:04:44.311 --> 00:04:47.853
"And this is a confirming book
in an Arabic tongue, so this"

00:04:47.853 --> 00:04:49.106
this being the Quran.

00:04:49.106 --> 00:04:50.879
This is a quote from the Quran.

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:54.081
"And this is a confirming
book in an Arabic tongue

00:04:54.081 --> 00:04:55.895
"to warn those who have wronged

00:04:55.895 --> 00:04:59.168
"and as good tidings
to the doers of good."

00:04:59.168 --> 00:05:01.319
So once again, a very clear message,

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:03.455
in at least the Islamic tradition,

00:05:03.455 --> 00:05:07.622
that this is the same faith
or tradition as that of Moses.

00:05:09.031 --> 00:05:10.857
And now here's reference to Jesus.

00:05:10.857 --> 00:05:14.397
"Then we caused our messengers
to follow in their footsteps

00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:17.119
"and we caused Jesus, son of Mary,

00:05:17.119 --> 00:05:19.404
"to follow and gave him the Gospel

00:05:19.404 --> 00:05:21.543
"and placed compassion and mercy

00:05:21.543 --> 00:05:24.742
"in the hearts of those who followed him."

00:05:24.742 --> 00:05:28.632
The key difference between
Muslims and Christians

00:05:28.632 --> 00:05:30.647
in terms of the life of Jesus,

00:05:30.647 --> 00:05:33.190
is that Muslims do not believe

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.176
in the crucifixion and the resurrection,

00:05:36.176 --> 00:05:37.886
and they do not believe that

00:05:37.886 --> 00:05:40.910
Jesus was God or the son of God.

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.354
They believe him to be a
very significant prophet,

00:05:44.354 --> 00:05:48.521
the prophet before Muhammad
came to reveal to the Quran.

00:05:49.553 --> 00:05:51.758
Now, for a practicing Muslim,

00:05:51.758 --> 00:05:53.923
there are often considered
to be five pillars,

00:05:53.923 --> 00:05:55.175
and this is especially the case

00:05:55.175 --> 00:05:58.074
for the majority of
Muslims, for Sunni Muslims.

00:05:58.074 --> 00:05:59.743
Shia Muslims have a slightly different

00:05:59.743 --> 00:06:03.841
combination of pillars, but
there's a lot of commonality.

00:06:03.841 --> 00:06:08.008
So the five pillars, the
first is this notion of faith,

00:06:08.866 --> 00:06:11.732
which is referred to Shahadah.

00:06:11.732 --> 00:06:15.440
Shadahah can also be interpreted
as testifying or testimony,

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.773
and it's this notion that a
Muslim needs to believe and say

00:06:17.773 --> 00:06:20.315
that there is no God but God.

00:06:20.315 --> 00:06:22.111
Muhammad is God's messenger.

00:06:22.111 --> 00:06:24.363
And in fact, to convert to Islam,

00:06:24.363 --> 00:06:26.772
you need to say this,
and you have to say it

00:06:26.772 --> 00:06:29.355
in the presence of at least two witnesses,

00:06:29.355 --> 00:06:32.758
and that's all that's
necessary in order to convert.

00:06:32.758 --> 00:06:34.866
Now, the other key element of Islam,

00:06:34.866 --> 00:06:37.116
the second you could
say of the five pillars,

00:06:37.116 --> 00:06:38.611
is this notion of prayer.

00:06:38.611 --> 00:06:40.794
So Muslims pray five times a day

00:06:40.794 --> 00:06:44.174
at dawn, noon, in the
afternoon, evening, and night,

00:06:44.174 --> 00:06:47.068
and they face in the
direction of the Kaaba,

00:06:47.068 --> 00:06:48.989
which is based in Mecca, which once again,

00:06:48.989 --> 00:06:52.410
they believe that Abraham
constructed with his son Ishmael,

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:56.835
who they believe that the Arab
people are descendant from.

00:06:56.835 --> 00:06:58.440
Now, what's interesting about this,

00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.844
this has a lot of parallels with

00:06:59.844 --> 00:07:03.638
the five times a day
prayer of the Zoroastrians,

00:07:03.638 --> 00:07:06.080
including the ritual washing of your body

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.330
before each prayer.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:13.074
Now, the third pillar is
charity, and it's called Zakat,

00:07:13.074 --> 00:07:17.300
and this is customarily two
and half percent of wealth.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.106
Now, two and half percent
might not sound like a lot,

00:07:19.106 --> 00:07:21.944
but this isn't of income,
this is of wealth.

00:07:21.944 --> 00:07:26.703
The fourth pillar is the
notion of fasting dawn to dusk

00:07:26.703 --> 00:07:29.949
during the ninth month
of the Islamic calender,

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:31.826
and that month is Ramadan,

00:07:31.826 --> 00:07:34.159
and it's fasting without food or water,

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:35.759
once again, from dawk to dusk,

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:39.020
and the Islamic calender
is a lunar calender,

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.949
and the notion of a month,

00:07:40.949 --> 00:07:43.312
in fact in English, it
comes from the word moon,

00:07:43.312 --> 00:07:46.698
because it's referring to
a full cycle of the moon.

00:07:46.698 --> 00:07:50.865
Now, the end of this month
ends with the Eid-al-Fitr,

00:07:51.769 --> 00:07:53.878
which is the Festival
of Breaking the Fast,

00:07:53.878 --> 00:07:58.587
which is considered one of the
two major holidays in Islam.

00:07:58.587 --> 00:08:01.828
Now, the fifth pillar of Islam is

00:08:01.828 --> 00:08:05.995
the notion of pilgrimage to the
Kaaba during the 12th month,

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.458
and it's during a certain
period in that 12th month,

00:08:09.458 --> 00:08:11.271
and then also in that 12th month,

00:08:11.271 --> 00:08:14.775
you have the second
major holiday in Islam,

00:08:14.775 --> 00:08:18.262
and that's Eid-al-Adha, the
Festival of the Sacrifice,

00:08:18.262 --> 00:08:21.474
and that once again is
making reference to Abraham

00:08:21.474 --> 00:08:25.292
and his willingness to sacrifice his son

00:08:25.292 --> 00:08:27.661
before God stops him.

00:08:27.661 --> 00:08:30.598
So this is the general idea of Islam.

00:08:30.598 --> 00:08:32.880
In other videos, we're going
to go into much more detail

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.286
in terms of how it started,

00:08:35.286 --> 00:08:40.264
the life of the Muslim prophet
Muhammad in Mecca and Medina,

00:08:40.264 --> 00:08:42.462
and then how it spread through the world

00:08:42.462 --> 00:08:45.682
shortly after or even
during the life of Muhammad

00:08:45.682 --> 00:08:49.849
in the sixth and seventh
centuries of the common era.
