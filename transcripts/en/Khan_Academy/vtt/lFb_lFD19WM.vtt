00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.700
- I'm Jordan, I'm a sophomore at Harvard.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.200
I'm first-generation college student.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.600
My dad works two, three jobs.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.040
My mom's still working.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.740
My grandparents, coming from Puerto Rico,

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.390
and that kind of thing, and
not having any education.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.570
So from two generations
ago, my grandparents,

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.170
not even going to middle
school, to me being at Harvard,

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.230
I think that is not only symbolic

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.110
of the hard work that it took to get here,

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.940
but it just shows that you work hard,

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:24.973
you can really do anything.

00:00:24.973 --> 00:00:25.990
(uplifting, exciting music)

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.360
With my dad always telling me, you know,

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.010
education is what's gonna
take you to the next level.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.210
No matter where you go to school,

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.780
no matter if you're in high school,

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.710
no matter if you're at the
best university in the world,

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.510
Khan Academy can be used anywhere.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.430
Just having that 24 hour,
free online resource

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.830
that I have used in the past
and am going to continue using,

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.770
to eventually help me reach my goals

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:46.960
of one day going to medical school.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.060
And one day, eventually becoming a doctor.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.470
Being the first doctor in my family

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.770
is going to be something
that's remarkable,

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.983
and it's gonna mean a lot to my family.
