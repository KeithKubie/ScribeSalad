don't go to this movie and expect a
 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.410
don't go to this movie and expect a
whole bunch of action sequences because

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420
whole bunch of action sequences because
 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.880

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890
that's not this kind of movie at all and
 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.470
that's not this kind of movie at all and
despite the fact that some aspects of

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269
of the movie and that is definitely
 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:28.789
of the movie and that is definitely
something to say because I really didn't

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799
something to say because I really didn't
 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.530
