00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.290
So, this is build machines with the size and the power consumption of an

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.670
entire town, to study tiny subnuclear effects.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.542
They built telescopes distributed over several continents orbiting

00:00:11.542 --> 00:00:16.239
the earth and space, to look back or out into the universe. So isn't

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:18.052
our knowledge physics accurate enough already? And,

00:00:18.052 --> 00:00:20.118
how many significant digits do we really need?

00:00:20.118 --> 00:00:25.240
&gt;&gt; The purpose of building big accelerators, is not

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.290
to improve the number of significant figures. it is to discover new phenomena.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:38.090
It is to discover, in discovering, for example.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.100
That a nucleus is made of protons and neutrons. That was a discovery at one

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.300
time, all right? One wasn't, one wasn't improving the

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.680
accuracy of the old theory. One was discovering something genuinely new.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.400
New phenomena that there were things called

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.180
protons and neutrons. When the atom was

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.878
discovered to be electrons going around in

00:00:59.878 --> 00:01:03.700
orbit in quantum mechanical orbits, that was

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.750
not improving accuracy. It was discovering a whole new way to fear/g, to think

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.430
about the world. The big machines that

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.837
are being built, to understand, let us say,

00:01:14.837 --> 00:01:18.230
elementary particles, are not being built to

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.300
imp, for the purpose of improving the

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.510
accuracy. let's say for chemistry or for whatever they're being built to try to

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.950
understand what, what the real phenomena at the at the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.460
base of our basic understanding of the world. and of what makes up matter,

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.780
what makes up things, and

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.340
it, it's not that it's going to improve the accuracy. It's going to change

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.200
the whole picture of the way we think things work. The same is true with

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.450
the big telescopes. Now, sometimes it's important

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.860
to improve accuracy. We have various ideas, for example, about

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.900
something called dark energy. Dark energy is the energy that's out there

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.120
in space that is causing the universe

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.850
to accelerate and expand faster and faster. the

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.830
various ideas may be very different than each other, but they may give rise to

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.360
answers which are pretty similar. And in that case, we build the machines to be

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.380
more accurate to describe, to try to

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.400
discriminate between different possibilities. But the different possibilities

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.430
really describe very, very different kinds of understandings of the world. So,

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.480
sometimes yes, we just really do want to improve the number of significant

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.666
figures. Also, sometimes in proving the number of significant figures,

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:51.870
figures, you discover discrepancies. An example might be,

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:58.660
studying the properties, the detailed properties of electrons.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.330
The properties of electrons, many of them are know to God knows how

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.730
many significant figures. eighth while they say,

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.020
that's a lot of significant figures. Supposing

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.510
we make a more accurate measurement and we discover that in the ninth

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.890
significant figure we don't agree experiment with

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:23.800
theory. That could really tell us something,

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.840
very deep about what the next step will be in understanding

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.820
elementary particles. So yeah, we do want to improve accuracy.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.350
But mostly, we want to discover new phenomena, new, not just

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.930
new phenomena but new understandings of what the old phenomena are.
