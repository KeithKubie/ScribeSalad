00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:02.036
- [Voiceover] So we have
two different logarithmic

00:00:02.036 --> 00:00:02.778
expressions here,

00:00:02.778 --> 00:00:05.297
one in yellow and one
in this pinkish color.

00:00:05.297 --> 00:00:06.528
And what I want you to do,

00:00:06.528 --> 00:00:09.209
like always, pause the
video and see if you can

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:10.518
re-write each of these

00:00:10.518 --> 00:00:14.534
logarithmic expressions in a simpler way.

00:00:14.534 --> 00:00:17.460
And I'll give you a hint in
case you haven't started yet.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.758
The hint is that if
you think about how you

00:00:19.758 --> 00:00:23.143
might be able to change the
base of the logarithmic,

00:00:23.143 --> 00:00:26.022
or the logarithms or the
logarithmic expressions,

00:00:26.022 --> 00:00:28.611
you might be able to
simplify this a good bit.

00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:31.026
And I'll give you an even further hint.

00:00:31.026 --> 00:00:32.883
When I'm talking about change of base,

00:00:32.883 --> 00:00:37.422
I'm saying that if I have the log base,

00:00:37.422 --> 00:00:38.852
and I'll color code it,

00:00:38.852 --> 00:00:42.763
log base A of B,

00:00:42.763 --> 00:00:46.524
log base A of B,

00:00:46.524 --> 00:00:50.808
this is going to be equal to log of B,

00:00:50.808 --> 00:00:55.280
log of B over log of A,

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.783
over

00:00:56.783 --> 00:00:59.604
log of A.

00:00:59.604 --> 00:01:01.067
Now you might be saying wait, wait, wait,

00:01:01.067 --> 00:01:02.425
we wrote a logarithm here but you didn't

00:01:02.425 --> 00:01:04.201
write what the base is.

00:01:04.201 --> 00:01:05.524
Well this is going to be true regardless

00:01:05.524 --> 00:01:07.335
of which base you choose
as long as you pick

00:01:07.335 --> 00:01:08.961
the same base.

00:01:08.961 --> 00:01:13.465
This could be base nine,
base nine in either case.

00:01:13.465 --> 00:01:16.948
Now typically, people choose base 10.

00:01:16.948 --> 00:01:19.478
So 10 is the most typical one to use

00:01:19.478 --> 00:01:21.359
and that's because most
peoples calculators

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:24.656
or they might be logarithmic
tables for base 10.

00:01:24.656 --> 00:01:28.023
So here you're saying the
exponent that I have to raise

00:01:28.023 --> 00:01:31.378
A to to get to B is equal to the exponent

00:01:31.378 --> 00:01:33.200
I have to raise 10 to to get to B,

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.244
divided by the exponent
I have to raise 10 to

00:01:35.244 --> 00:01:37.078
to get to A.

00:01:37.078 --> 00:01:40.212
This is a really really
useful thing to know

00:01:40.212 --> 00:01:42.174
if you are dealing with logarithms.

00:01:42.174 --> 00:01:45.355
And we prove it in another video.

00:01:45.355 --> 00:01:48.129
But now we'll see if we can apply it.

00:01:48.129 --> 00:01:50.788
So now going back to
this yellow expression,

00:01:50.788 --> 00:01:52.463
this once again, is the same thing

00:01:52.463 --> 00:01:56.422
as one divided by this right over here.

00:01:56.422 --> 00:01:57.826
So let me write it that way actually.

00:01:57.826 --> 00:02:00.601
This is one divided by

00:02:00.601 --> 00:02:04.815
log base B of four.

00:02:04.815 --> 00:02:07.021
Well let's use what we just said over here

00:02:07.021 --> 00:02:08.135
to re-write it.

00:02:08.135 --> 00:02:10.225
So this is going to be equal to,

00:02:10.225 --> 00:02:11.896
this is going to be equal to one,

00:02:11.896 --> 00:02:13.661
divided by,

00:02:13.661 --> 00:02:15.739
instead of writing it log base B of four,

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.988
we could write it as log of four,

00:02:19.988 --> 00:02:22.124
and if I just, if I don't
write the base there

00:02:22.124 --> 00:02:24.353
we can assume that it's base 10,

00:02:24.353 --> 00:02:27.285
log of four over

00:02:27.285 --> 00:02:30.280
log of B.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.262
Now if I divide by some fraction,

00:02:34.262 --> 00:02:35.562
or some rational expression,

00:02:35.562 --> 00:02:36.851
it's the same thing as multiplying by

00:02:36.851 --> 00:02:38.209
the reciprocal.

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.566
So this is going to be equal one times

00:02:40.566 --> 00:02:42.284
the reciprocal of this.

00:02:42.284 --> 00:02:45.767
Log of B over

00:02:45.767 --> 00:02:48.390
log of four,

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.505
which of course is just going to be

00:02:49.505 --> 00:02:52.767
log of B over log of four,

00:02:52.767 --> 00:02:54.984
I just multiplied it by one,

00:02:54.984 --> 00:02:56.969
and so we can go in the
other direction now,

00:02:56.969 --> 00:02:59.326
using this little tool we established at

00:02:59.326 --> 00:03:00.406
the beginning of the video.

00:03:00.406 --> 00:03:02.022
This is the same thing as

00:03:02.022 --> 00:03:06.468
log base four of B,

00:03:06.468 --> 00:03:10.032
log base four of B.

00:03:10.032 --> 00:03:12.210
So we have a pretty neat result

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.864
that actually came out here,

00:03:13.864 --> 00:03:15.217
we didn't prove it for any values,

00:03:15.217 --> 00:03:17.492
although we have a pretty general B here.

00:03:17.492 --> 00:03:19.350
If I take the,

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.856
If I take the reciprocal of

00:03:22.856 --> 00:03:25.293
a logarithmic expression,

00:03:25.293 --> 00:03:28.428
I essentially have swapped the bases.

00:03:28.428 --> 00:03:30.518
This is log base B,

00:03:30.518 --> 00:03:31.969
what exponent do I have to raise B to

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:33.698
to get to four?

00:03:33.698 --> 00:03:35.115
And then here I have what exponent

00:03:35.115 --> 00:03:37.378
do I have to raise four to to get to B?

00:03:37.378 --> 00:03:40.292
Now it might seem a
little bit magical until

00:03:40.292 --> 00:03:43.067
you actually put some
tangible numbers here.

00:03:43.067 --> 00:03:44.437
Then it starts to make sense,

00:03:44.437 --> 00:03:46.712
especially relative to
fractional exponents.

00:03:46.712 --> 00:03:49.289
For example, we know that
four to the third power

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:51.576
is equal to 64.

00:03:51.576 --> 00:03:55.790
So if I had log base four of 64,

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.880
that's going to be equal to three.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.140
And if I were to say

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.342
log base 64 of four,

00:04:04.342 --> 00:04:05.851
well now I'm going to have to raise that

00:04:05.851 --> 00:04:07.871
to the one third power.

00:04:07.871 --> 00:04:10.542
So notice, they are the
reciprocal of each other.

00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:12.411
So actually not so magical after all,

00:04:12.411 --> 00:04:15.638
but it's nice to see how
everything fits together.

00:04:15.638 --> 00:04:16.658
Now let's try to,

00:04:16.658 --> 00:04:19.537
now let's try to tackle
this one over here.

00:04:19.537 --> 00:04:21.638
So I've log base C of 16,

00:04:21.638 --> 00:04:26.305
times log base two of C, alright.

00:04:26.305 --> 00:04:28.534
So this one, once again it might be nice

00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:31.053
to re-write these, each of these,

00:04:31.053 --> 00:04:34.873
as a rational expression
dealing with log base 10.

00:04:34.873 --> 00:04:37.368
So this first one,

00:04:37.368 --> 00:04:38.889
this first one I could write this as

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:43.272
log base 10 of 16,

00:04:43.272 --> 00:04:44.747
remember if I don't write the base

00:04:44.747 --> 00:04:46.732
you can assume it's 10,

00:04:46.732 --> 00:04:49.435
over log

00:04:49.435 --> 00:04:53.475
over log base 10 of C,

00:04:53.475 --> 00:04:56.772
and we're going to be multiplying this by,

00:04:56.772 --> 00:04:58.618
now this is going to be,

00:04:58.618 --> 00:05:01.160
we can write this as,

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.144
log base 10 of C,

00:05:04.144 --> 00:05:06.061
log base 10 of C

00:05:06.061 --> 00:05:09.864
over, over log base

00:05:09.864 --> 00:05:12.128
10 of two.

00:05:12.128 --> 00:05:15.065
Log base 10 of two.

00:05:15.065 --> 00:05:16.713
Once again I could have
these little 10's here

00:05:16.713 --> 00:05:19.233
if it makes you comfortable.

00:05:19.233 --> 00:05:21.473
I could do something like
that but I don't have to.

00:05:21.473 --> 00:05:23.342
And now this is interesting,
cuz if I'm multiplying

00:05:23.342 --> 00:05:26.175
by log of C, and dividing by log of C,

00:05:26.175 --> 00:05:27.835
both of them base 10,

00:05:27.835 --> 00:05:29.716
well those are going to cancel out

00:05:29.716 --> 00:05:31.341
and I'm going to be left with

00:05:31.341 --> 00:05:34.139
log base 16,

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:38.167
sorry log base 10 of 16 over,

00:05:38.167 --> 00:05:42.683
over log base 10 of two.

00:05:42.683 --> 00:05:44.889
And we know how to go
the other direction here,

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:46.804
this is going to be,

00:05:46.804 --> 00:05:49.567
this is gong to be the logarithm,

00:05:49.567 --> 00:05:53.224
log base two of 16.

00:05:53.224 --> 00:05:57.542
Log base two of 16,

00:05:57.542 --> 00:05:59.446
and we're not done yet because all this is

00:05:59.446 --> 00:06:01.687
is what power do I need to raise two to

00:06:01.687 --> 00:06:04.415
to get to 16?

00:06:04.415 --> 00:06:06.725
We'll have to raise two to the,

00:06:06.725 --> 00:06:09.349
I have to raise two to the fourth power.

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:11.810
We did it in the blue color.

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.609
To raise two to the fourth power

00:06:13.609 --> 00:06:15.130
to get to 16.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:16.813
So that's, this is kind of a cool thing,

00:06:16.813 --> 00:06:17.672
cuz in the beginning,

00:06:17.672 --> 00:06:19.309
I started with this variable C,

00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:20.528
it looked like we were
going to have deal with

00:06:20.528 --> 00:06:21.782
a pretty abstract thing,

00:06:21.782 --> 00:06:24.673
but you can actually
evaluate this kind of crazy

00:06:24.673 --> 00:06:26.402
looking expression right over here,

00:06:26.402 --> 00:06:28.747
evaluates to the number four.

00:06:28.747 --> 00:06:29.827
In fact if I had to run some type

00:06:29.827 --> 00:06:31.290
of a math scavenger hunt or something,

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.043
this could be a pretty good clue for

00:06:33.043 --> 00:06:35.272
evaluating to four.

00:06:35.272 --> 00:06:38.685
You know walk this many
steps forward or something.

00:06:38.685 --> 00:06:41.419
It'd be pretty cool.
