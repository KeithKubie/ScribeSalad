1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,460
Molly, you're definitely one
of the best in the world, man.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,210
I get happy when you're refereeing a
fight because I don't know that it's going

3
00:00:06,211 --> 00:00:08,250
to be handled. The, I mean,

4
00:00:08,251 --> 00:00:12,210
I agree with you on virtually every single
time you and I have had a discussion

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,590
about what should or shouldn't be
done. Much of a struggle. It is. Right.

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,370
Especially clench work. Exactly. The guys
get a guy up against the cage. There's,

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,460
they're working for something.
They might stall each other out,

8
00:00:23,461 --> 00:00:27,300
but eventually someone might
break down. Right. I mean,

9
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,560
and this is how a garlic [inaudible]
men off wins fights against elite guys.

10
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:36,040
This is how Randy coture one, a lot of
fights. It's a legitimate tactic. Yeah.

11
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,610
Cause it doesn't look fun for you.
You know,

12
00:00:38,611 --> 00:00:42,030
like a guy beating a guy up
against the cage is short elbows,

13
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:46,710
knees to the thighs. You might think
that that's not enough. But that's,

14
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:47,663
that's uh,

15
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,840
that's a good way to where a dude out
and you keep doing that until eventually

16
00:00:51,841 --> 00:00:55,310
you break them. And especially when you're
someone like Steve Bay or, yeah. Yeah.

17
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,970
I think, I think for me it's helpful as
I do my pre-fight instructions, you know,

18
00:00:59,971 --> 00:01:03,840
so I tell the fighters what I
expect and what to expect from me,

19
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,160
you know what I mean?
So I don't want to,

20
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,820
I want to interfere as little as possible.
Yeah, I know. You know? And so that's,

21
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,670
that's my goal. And so I, you know, I give
them instruction. If I tell him, you know,

22
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:16,280
hey, work work would I expect
and you know, I expect you
to do something too. I'm,

23
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,840
when I'm looking for big shots
or advance your position.

24
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,910
And then they'll ask me
like, well, how much,

25
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,760
how long will you leave something
stale? I go, well, what is still,

26
00:01:23,761 --> 00:01:25,950
if they're both guys were relaxed,
that still,

27
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,740
but like you're talking about even
up against the fence in a clinch,

28
00:01:28,741 --> 00:01:32,040
especially that's where a lot of
things are really getting decided.

29
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,370
And so we have to really
see that play out. You know,

30
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,520
especially a lot of the
guys are, you know, they're,

31
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,860
they're striking in each other and maybe
in some of the other weight classes,

32
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,340
you know, uh, then they don't
have that one punch all ways. Uh,

33
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,250
some of the guys do,
but not everyone does.

34
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,860
And that's where things are going
to get cited in that clinch.

35
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,530
And if there's a tension,
if there's a tension there,

36
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:55,500
we need to see where that's gonna
go and let it work itself out.

37
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:59,490
I'm so glad you said that. That's a
perfect way to say it. That's absolutely.

38
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,650
I hundred percent agree.
And there's,

39
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,350
there's moments where it changes the
course of the fight where it's really

40
00:02:04,351 --> 00:02:09,000
unfortunate. Um, you didn't referee
Camaros, Mana Damien Maia, did you?

41
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:13,530
I don't think so. Whoever did that
one, we don't even have to pull it up,

42
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,750
but there was a moment in the first round
when Damien Maia got ahold of tomorrow

43
00:02:17,751 --> 00:02:22,130
and was trying to take his back standing
and he had like one hook in a clench

44
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,620
and he was hanging onto him
and the referee decided not
enough was taking place.

45
00:02:25,621 --> 00:02:29,160
They separated them. I'm
like, Oh, you can't do that.

46
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,490
So hard to get ahold of it wasn't me.

47
00:02:32,491 --> 00:02:37,240
Who did that Guy Damien Maia
about to get you back and say,

48
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,700
no, no, that's not going
anywhere. That Sarah went
crazy. You know he has that, um,

49
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,000
that podcast he does what?
Jim Norton and he's like,

50
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:48,510
you just don't do that until the guy
like he's, he's got a hold of him.

51
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,500
Like he might take his back here
like, yeah, like in, you know,

52
00:02:52,501 --> 00:02:55,320
you saw what he did with lime and
good when he takes your back. Yeah.

53
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,860
In line with goods and pieced.
But when Damien gets a hold,

54
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:02,920
especially early in the round,
right. And it's fresh and he's,

55
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:06,940
he's got his back already and then any
other lot of interesting take down from

56
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:08,250
there too while he's like,
he goes,

57
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,580
goes back and forth with Taf way taking
your back and then when your definitive

58
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:15,940
take down he starts taking your back and
when you go back then he's back working

59
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:19,960
on yet. So now he works really, he
works at a real interesting piece there,

60
00:03:19,961 --> 00:03:23,380
you know, it's stunning to
watch him go through. Guys,

61
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,590
like when he went through Rick
story, I was like, Jesus Christ.

62
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:28,900
Like Rick story's up powerful wrestler.
Yeah.

63
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,780
And when he takes his back and
he gets them in that neck crank,

64
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:35,860
and he seen the blood squirting out of
his nose and like, Whoa, yeah, this is,

65
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:40,840
this is a heavy fucking squeeze. This guy
as, and then he did it to Carlos condit.

66
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,800
Um, who else has done to, it's not a
lot of guys. He gets a hold of you.

67
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:47,440
It's just squeezes the life.
And when he gets on top,

68
00:03:47,441 --> 00:03:51,820
he seems so heavy on Magni when he ran
through Neil magnates like, oh yeah,

69
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,810
yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just
such high level Jujitsu. You,

70
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:00,880
he was on top.
He's just just no air to smushes you.
