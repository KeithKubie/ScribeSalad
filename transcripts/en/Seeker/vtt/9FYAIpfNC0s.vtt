00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.326
Long-distance swimmer Ben Lecomte and the crew of Seeker are on a mission

00:00:04.326 --> 00:00:07.500
to bring attention to changing ocean ecosystems.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.960
But along the way, Ben's internal ecosystem 
will change too,

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.080
presenting scientists with a unique opportunity to show just how much our environment affects

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.380
the millions of microbes swimming within us.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.680
JARRAD: The human microbiome is basically all of the bacteria that encompass who you are.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.180
You have pretty much a ten to one ratio of bacterial cells

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.560
that live on you and in you at any point in time, of cells that actually make up who you are.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.140
The microbiome Influences pretty much everything, from endocrinology – your hormones –

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.980
to inflammatory responses, and even changing some of the connections in the brain.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.809
But yet, we still don't know how exercise is actually shaping our microbial environments.

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.700
This will be the first longitudinal study to ever look at human gut health, and how exercise

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.780
can modulate and influence human health as a whole.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.660
Jarrad and his team at the Argonne National Laboratory

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.400
are working with Ben's doctors to monitor how completing the extreme athletic feat

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.360
of swimming across the Pacific will impact Ben's health.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.040
JARRAD: How much of the water microbiome or the ocean microbiome is actually influencing his gut?

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.560
Is there kind of a cap to the effect that you can get from exercise itself, and its ability

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.420
to modulate the microbiome?

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.220
So, when we say microbiome, what we really mean is our interaction with the environment

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.940
and how not only we shape our environment, but the bacteria that live on us and in us at any point in time

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.300
shape it with us.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.720
We're taking every metric we can get, not only about him, but every environment that he's in

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.739
and how long he's there.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.880
He's basically doing an ultra-marathon each day.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.100
The main hypothesis is that we know his body is going to adapt; we just don't know how... yet.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.240
Researchers are also logging the macro-and micro-nutrient profiles of Ben's daily diet,

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.200
a combination of liquids and solid meals of grain,

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.000
canned vegetables, and protein supplements.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.780
This high-fat meal plan clocks in at over 8,000 calories per day, which seems like a lot

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.820
but Ben will need every calorie to keep his stamina up.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.840
MAKS: During the Swim we make him a soup. 
We start with a freeze-dried meal

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.810
We grinded it and I put some extra secret ingredients in it – CalorieMates – to make it like, more heavy for him

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.380
so he has more fuel to burn.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.700
Also, I put carbohydrate powder in it, and every hour when he stops his swim he can have a little bit of that,

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.720
together with the bread Yoav is making.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.360
Preliminary research has shown that extreme athletes who train rigorously and follow a high-calorie diet

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.000
actually have a distinctly different microbiome
from the average person,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.620
which is the reason scientists like Jarrad are interested in studying people like Ben.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.400
What makes an athlete's microbiome so unique may come down to how their gut flora

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.900
enable them to maximize their metabolism,

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.020
and ultimately build the amino acids which help to create and repair tissue.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.060
JARRAD: Athletes are considered, like,  an elevated model of the human, right?

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.640
So exercise in itself increases diversity,
first and foremost.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.480
Increases in diversity generally means
 increases in human health,

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.580
or promotes normal function or normal homeostasis.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.240
Jarrad's team thinks that if we can identify the beneficial super-organisms or mechanisms

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.300
that come into play during extreme exertion,
we may be able to develop

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.660
targeted probiotics that could potentially allow
anyone to replicate

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.920
a pro-athlete's microbiome, without having to consume 8,000 calories or swim eight hours a day.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.860
JARRAD: There are a lot of connections between the microbiota and preventive medicine,

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.880
so if we can understand various aspects of our lifestyle

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.260
and how they influence not only our genomic content,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.740
our gene activations, our functional potentials...
we then can start to get at

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.960
prescribing individualized preventative therapeutics, 
or medical applications

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.480
to look at not only promoting human health, 
but maintaining it as well.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:10.100
This would have immense implications for everything from controlling weight, to improving disease immunity

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.200
to enhancing psychological function.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.140
It's only the beginning of a new approach to monitoring and caring for our bodies,

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.940
but Ben's diving in, so we can scratch the surface.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.740
JARRAD: This is kind of like a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity,

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.900
not only from his standpoint, to raise awareness about conservation, environmental health,

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.700
as well as environmental exposure and what we're doing to our environment...

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:37.080
but it also raises questions about understanding human health,  the value of exercise and

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.940
actually testing the human limits
and what we can get from that.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.740
He's really driving a lot of science, and I'm really just happy to be a part of it.
