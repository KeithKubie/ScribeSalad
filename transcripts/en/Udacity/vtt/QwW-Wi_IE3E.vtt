00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:06.850
Okay, then the last thing is PSRs,
or Predictive State Representation.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.260
&gt;&gt; Yes, indeed and
the upshot of the PSR idea was what?

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.970
&gt;&gt; Well, that rather than thinking about
states which might not even exist, and

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:15.950
even if they do exist you never
know where you're in them or not,

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.759
so really they don't exist in some very
important insane potato sort of way.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.380
What does make sense to think about is
whether there are specific tests that

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.510
you could take that would then predict
what you are likely to observe.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.910
And that in some sense that's a very
satisfying way of thinking about

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.950
the world that I need to
kind of keep track of and

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.700
well if I were to do certain
things now what would happen and

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.200
that was kind of the push for
sort of PSRs.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.500
And in so far as you prefer that kind
of way of thinking about the world,

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.540
the nice thing is that PSRs
can represent any POMDP, and

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.870
so they're equivalent.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.670
&gt;&gt; Right, except maybe more palatable
philosophically or so forth.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.160
Certainly Rich Sutton was pushing

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.320
people in the direction of this
representation for that reason.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.529
There's a kind of philosophical
stance that says.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:05.519
Am I sick?

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.520
What does it mean to be sick?

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.790
It means that I [LAUGH]
could be dead tomorrow,

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.460
I could be stuck in bed tomorrow,
I could be running a fever.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.060
It's like there's a bunch of observable
things that are a function of

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.380
what the current state is, and so

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.960
it might be useful to talk about things
in terms of what those predictions

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.300
are as opposed to positing some
kind of magical internal state.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.710
&gt;&gt; Well, this makes sense right
because the only usefulness.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.260
If you go back to that and we talked
about this on our lesson management

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:35.300
course in some sense the only
usefulness of a state is what it allows

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.610
you to predict about what's going to
happen next, little made of objects.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.880
So, the only reason it's worthwhile
even recognizing something as a state

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.390
is it allows me to distinguish
between something else that might be

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.680
important later.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.080
So right, so another one of our
universal contradictory truths is that

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.230
states and
predictors are kind of the same thing.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.530
&gt;&gt; Yeah, all things are the same.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:54.110
&gt;&gt; Excellent, all right,

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.030
so I think that's the last lesson
that I was doing by myself.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.080
I think I'm going to turn it
over to you for the next one.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.760
&gt;&gt; Well, I will point out that
you none of this by yourself like

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.600
we've done this together.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.970
&gt;&gt; That's fair.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.780
&gt;&gt; Alright, well with that I
guess we should say goodbye.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.440
&gt;&gt; Alright, see you next time.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.143
&gt;&gt; Bye.

00:02:09.143 --> 00:02:10.374
