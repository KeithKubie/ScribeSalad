00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.210
PROFESSOR: So when we're looking
at assessing the students,

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.360
we're looking an awful lot at
their work on their project.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.430
More so than the
actual project itself.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.380
And we're also thinking
about what did they learn

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.130
and what can they
demonstrate that they've

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.860
learned from the project?

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.550
So a fair chunk of
their assessment

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.610
is making sure they're in
class and participating.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.390
And that's actually
separate from projects.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.810
And then, within
the project we're

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:42.330
looking at how well they
managed and ran their project,

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.870
and worked together on a group
to get their project done.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.640
And that, again, has less to do
with how the project turned out

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.850
and more with how
they worked on it.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.110
We've got about an
equal chunk on does

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.660
the project meet the
specified requirements

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.572
for the assignment?

00:00:59.572 --> 00:01:02.030
As we say, we're not actually
looking for good games, here.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.196
We don't expect you guys
to come up with good games,

00:01:04.196 --> 00:01:07.220
given all the constraints we
piled and the time you have.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.640
What we want to know is, can you
make a reasonably complete game

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.340
that fits all the requirements
we given you, and runs well?

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.720
And then, the final chunk is
their own personal reflection.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.480
We ask after every project,
we ask each of them

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.520
to write an essay, basically.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.600
It's a short essay.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.060
But it's talking about what
they did on their project, what

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.620
worked well, what didn't work
well, what changes they would

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.211
make to the process and to the
project on their next project,

00:01:37.211 --> 00:01:38.960
because we really want
them to be learning

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.750
from these experiences.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.400
And so what we're
really looking for

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.220
is proof that they
have learned something,

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.070
and it's going to affect the
way they work going forward.
