1
00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:03.550
Okay,
let's start up.

2
00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.660
So last time we got to the point of asking the question,

3
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.240
are there atoms and molecules and we'll,
I anticipate that the answer is yes.

4
00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.870
And what force holds the atoms together?

5
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.660
Because if we really understand the force that holds him,

6
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.740
we got chemistry all solved.
Okay.

7
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.660
So when you come to the idea of,
of forces in the,
in the first place,

8
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.530
one goes back to Newton and the Principia Mathematica

9
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.460
and he,
he had the idea or developed the idea of the mathematics of gravity.

10
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.780
And the interesting thing about it was there was no mechanism for it.

11
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.400
There were no springs or strings that connected to things,
right?

12
00:00:48.401 --> 00:00:50.650
It was action at a distance.

13
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.430
So there were other ideas like Descartes had the idea that gravity resulted from

14
00:00:57.341 --> 00:00:58.540
blocked repulsion,

15
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.510
that the universe was Philip Particle zipping around and bombarding thing.

16
00:01:03.511 --> 00:01:07.960
So like the moon would be bombarded by particles from all directions,

17
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.300
but there'd be no net force on it because they'd all balance out.
However,

18
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.460
if you put the earth in the way,

19
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.010
there'd be a shadow and now you'd have more things hitting the moon from the

20
00:01:21.011 --> 00:01:25.390
right than from the left.
So it would seem to be attracted to the earth.

21
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.953
<v 1>Okay,</v>

22
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.770
<v 0>so that's a great mechanism.</v>

23
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.400
Right now it was important for Newton that the force be proportional to r

24
00:01:35.801 --> 00:01:40.280
squared
to inverse r squared,

25
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.950
one over r squared.
Does this work for that?

26
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.780
If you pulled the earth back,
how would you change things?

27
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.150
What'd he say?
It does,
it doesn't work.

28
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.890
What would it block more or fewer things?
If you pulled it back,

29
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.560
how many fewer?
Suppose you made it twice as far back.

30
00:02:04.561 --> 00:02:08.220
How many fewer would would be blocked from hitting the moon?

31
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:10.783
<v 1>It would be,</v>

32
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.850
<v 0>it would be one over r squared.
Even think about that.
So that would,</v>

33
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.850
that,
that aspect of it would work.
How about,
you know,

34
00:02:20.851 --> 00:02:24.930
gravity is proportional to the mass of the things.
How does that figure,

35
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.850
you can think about that yourself.
Okay.
But anyhow,
there were other ideas,

36
00:02:29.851 --> 00:02:34.380
but Newton didn't think about the mechanism.
He thought about the law,

37
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.460
right?
That it was one over r squared and proportional to the masses.

38
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:44.210
Now in 1717 he published the second edition of optics,

39
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:46.560
right?

40
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.340
He published the first edition in 17 four and the reason that he published it in

41
00:02:51.341 --> 00:02:56.341
[inaudible] 17 for was that Robert Hooke died in 17 three he'd actually,

42
00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.980
Newton had done this work in the,

43
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.020
in the 1660s and seventies but he didn't publish it until hope died because he

44
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:07.910
didn't want hook to get on his case criticizing it,
right?

45
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.760
But in the second edition,

46
00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:14.530
in 1717 he put some additional material you'll see with additions and the

47
00:03:14.531 --> 00:03:17.290
additional material,
even though the book is about optics,

48
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.850
the additional material is about chemistry,
right?
So,

49
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:25.720
and it's at the end and posed not as hypotheses,

50
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.320
but as questions because May Konijn people following Francis Bacon weren't

51
00:03:32.771 --> 00:03:36.520
supposed to make hypotheses that they could ask questions.

52
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.290
So here are some of the questions.

53
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.990
Question 31 the one that has most to do with chemistry have not the small

54
00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:46.210
particles of bodies,
certain powers,

55
00:03:46.211 --> 00:03:50.590
virtues or forces by which they act at a distance,

56
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.800
not only on the rays of light to reflect,
reflect an inflect them,

57
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.870
but also upon one another for producing a great part of the phenomena of nature

58
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.150
that is attraction between the particles or repulsion for its will known that

59
00:04:07.151 --> 00:04:11.110
bodies act upon one another by the attractions of gravity,

60
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.120
magnetism and electricity.

61
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.830
And these instances show the tenor in course of nature and make it not

62
00:04:17.831 --> 00:04:18.790
improbable,

63
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.060
but that there may be more attractive powers than these for nature is very

64
00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:26.890
consonant and conformable to herself.

65
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.350
How these attractions may be performed,
I do not hear,
consider

66
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.480
what I call attraction may be performed by impulse.

67
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.190
Where did he get that idea?

68
00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.920
Where did he get the idea that their impulses that can cause attraction.

69
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.560
That was Descartes' idea,
right?
That we just explained.
Okay.

70
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.490
Uh,
or by some other means unknown to me.

71
00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.940
I use that word here to signify only in general,

72
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.470
any force by which bodies tend toward one another whatsoever.

73
00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:07.690
Be the cause for,

74
00:05:07.691 --> 00:05:10.960
we must learn from the phenomena of nature,

75
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:16.410
what bodies attract one another and what are the laws and properties of

76
00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:21.691
attraction before we inquire the caused by which the attraction is performed.

77
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.810
Right?
So get the law first so you can do mathematics on it.

78
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:31.030
Then worry about how it works.
The attractions of gravity,

79
00:05:31.031 --> 00:05:35.380
magnetism,
and electricity react to very sensible distances.

80
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.390
He doesn't mean reasonable.

81
00:05:37.391 --> 00:05:42.391
He means ones that you can sense and so have been observed by vulgar eyes.

82
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.100
You can see the distance is over which electrostatic attraction works.

83
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.610
Obviously gravity,
magnetism,

84
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:58.230
and there may be others which reached to so small distances as hither to to

85
00:05:58.641 --> 00:06:00.050
escape observation.

86
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.740
And perhaps electrical attraction may reach to such small distances even without

87
00:06:05.901 --> 00:06:07.430
being excited by friction.

88
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.210
So you know that friction can generate static electricity does make things

89
00:06:11.211 --> 00:06:12.044
attract,

90
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:16.370
but maybe even without friction you can get things that will attract very short

91
00:06:16.371 --> 00:06:17.630
distance by electricity.

92
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.270
The parts of all homogeneous,
all hard bodies,

93
00:06:23.271 --> 00:06:27.350
which fully touch one another stick together very strongly.

94
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:32.060
Did you ever have that experience of having to really flat things,

95
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.890
put them together and they're very hard to get apart.
What

96
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:42.260
microscopes slides do you ever take out new microscope slides?

97
00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:43.970
It can be very hard to get apart

98
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:50.660
and for explaining how this may be some of invented hooked Adams,

99
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.040
which is begging the question and others tell us that bodies are glued together

100
00:06:55.041 --> 00:07:00.041
by rest that is by an occult quality or rather by nothing and others that they

101
00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:05.600
stick together by conspiring motions that is by relative rests among themselves.

102
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.960
These are other theories that are sort of complicated.
We don't need to go into,

103
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:15.580
I had rather infer from their cohesion that there are particles attract one

104
00:07:16.281 --> 00:07:17.840
another by some force,

105
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:24.070
which in immediate contact is exceeding strong at small distances,

106
00:07:24.951 --> 00:07:29.951
performs the chemical operations above mentioned and reaches not far from the

107
00:07:30.351 --> 00:07:33.530
particles with any sensible effect.

108
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.260
So a very short range,

109
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:41.500
very strong attraction reaches not far from the particles with any sensible

110
00:07:42.651 --> 00:07:43.484
effect.

111
00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:48.440
So maybe it's even more dramatic than one over r squared.

112
00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:52.550
One over r squared changes very rapidly when art gets very small.

113
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.810
But maybe it's even a law that's more,
more distance dependence than that.

114
00:07:56.811 --> 00:08:01.730
That only works at really,
really small distances.
The attraction,

115
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:06.050
and he's talking about between glass plates separated by a thin film of the oil

116
00:08:06.051 --> 00:08:08.690
of oranges.
So,
you know,
microscope slides,

117
00:08:08.691 --> 00:08:10.550
if you put a little drop us up and stick them together,

118
00:08:10.551 --> 00:08:11.750
they're really hard to get apart.

119
00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:18.620
May Be proportionally greater the attraction and continue to increase until the

120
00:08:18.621 --> 00:08:22.790
thickness did not exceed that of a single particle of oil.

121
00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.380
Imagine Newton

122
00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:30.530
350 years ago or 300 years ago here,
uh,

123
00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:35.510
thinking about a single particle of oil.
How could he,

124
00:08:35.511 --> 00:08:37.130
could he possibly measure that?

125
00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:42.710
We'll think about that later.
Okay.

126
00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:48.410
There are there for agents in nature able to make the particles of bodies stick

127
00:08:48.411 --> 00:08:53.411
together by very strong attractions and it is the business of experimental

128
00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:59.100
philosophy to find them out.
That's what we need to find.

129
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.220
What is it that holds these particles together?

130
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:05.760
Experimental philosophy means science.
Okay.

131
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:11.130
And we're gonna engage this business and it'll take us about five weeks to

132
00:09:11.131 --> 00:09:15.860
figure out what it is that holds these things together.
Okay.

133
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:16.591
Now,

134
00:09:16.591 --> 00:09:21.591
let's just look at from physics at the amount of binding energy you get from

135
00:09:21.631 --> 00:09:26.190
different kinds of laws.
First,
there's cool ohms law,

136
00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:29.220
so charges over the distance.
I think you all know that one.

137
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:34.920
Then there's magnetic interaction to magnetic dipoles.
The energy,

138
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.940
the energy is one over r cubed falls off very rapidly.

139
00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:43.620
Then there's the strong binding that holds particles together in the nuclei of

140
00:09:43.621 --> 00:09:46.800
atoms and gravitation of course,

141
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.070
and the chemical bond.

142
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:54.570
So here's the scale of energies and we use in this course the old fashioned

143
00:09:54.571 --> 00:09:59.130
kilocalories per mole,
which American organic chemists like to use.

144
00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:02.430
Some day it'll change to kill the jewels per bowl,

145
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:06.990
but for me it's still kilocalories per mole.
Okay?
This is a logarithmic scale,

146
00:10:06.991 --> 00:10:08.700
so it covers a very wide range.

147
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:13.950
Now Coolum if you have a proton and an electron as far apart as the distance of

148
00:10:13.951 --> 00:10:18.300
a carbon carbon bond,
that's 216 kilocalories per mole,

149
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.160
right in the middle of this or near the middle,

150
00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:23.760
magnetic interaction is much weaker.

151
00:10:23.761 --> 00:10:28.470
If you have two electron spins at the same distance from one another,

152
00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:32.460
their energy is what?
One,
two,
three,
four,

153
00:10:32.461 --> 00:10:36.270
five orders of magnitude smaller,
10 to the fifth smaller,

154
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:42.090
the strong binding that holds a proton and the neutron together in the deuterium

155
00:10:42.091 --> 00:10:43.920
nucleus that is within the nucleus,

156
00:10:43.921 --> 00:10:48.921
not at 1.54 Ostrom's is 10 to the fifth stronger than Coolum Vic interaction.

157
00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:54.600
And gravity is ever so much weaker.

158
00:10:54.601 --> 00:10:57.480
If you had two carbon atoms that were at that distance,

159
00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:02.550
the energy would be 10 to the minus 32 kilocalories from also forget gravity as

160
00:11:02.551 --> 00:11:05.880
a way of holding things together,
right?
Uh,

161
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:10.910
but then we have Coolum buck up or down by 10 orders of by five orders of

162
00:11:11.731 --> 00:11:15.510
magnitude right.
Now what does a chemical bond,
how strong is it?

163
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:21.000
A chemical bond is about the carbon carbon bond is about 90 kilocalories per

164
00:11:21.001 --> 00:11:21.834
mole.

165
00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:26.070
So not so far from the Coolo energy from electrostatic attraction.

166
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:30.900
So maybe this hints that electrostatic attraction has something to do with it,

167
00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:35.400
but maybe not.
Maybe it's something entirely new.
And

168
00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:40.080
we haven't talked about kinetic energy.

169
00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.660
Does that have anything to do with the strength of the bond?

170
00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:47.430
So we'll get back to that later on.
Okay.

171
00:11:47.431 --> 00:11:51.270
So is there a chemical force law,
the thing that Newton was looking for?

172
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:56.890
Now,
Here's interesting way to phrase that.
Suppose you had a chain of Adam's,

173
00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:01.960
a thread that was single atoms bonded to one another and you started stretching

174
00:12:01.961 --> 00:12:05.680
it.
It would stretch and at some point it would pop.

175
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:07.953
Okay,

176
00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:12.340
now let's just take three of the atoms and we'll put stiff rods on the outer

177
00:12:12.341 --> 00:12:16.840
ones and we'll start stretching it a little stretch,
stretch,

178
00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:20.180
stretch,
Strout

179
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.760
pop.
Okay?

180
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:29.530
Now the question is how far do you stretch it before it pops?

181
00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:35.140
What determines how far you stretch it before it pops?
Okay,

182
00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.260
this must have to do with the forest law between Adams,

183
00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:41.230
which will then we'll have to do with molecular structure,

184
00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:45.840
so it could be like springs,
Hooke's law,
Atencio,
sick viess.

185
00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:46.961
Okay,

186
00:12:46.961 --> 00:12:50.470
so the forest is proportional to the displacement and the energy to the square

187
00:12:50.471 --> 00:12:54.940
of the displacement and the energy.
Then potential energy as a Parabola,

188
00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:59.590
we defined zero when they're at the standard on unstretched distance,

189
00:12:59.591 --> 00:13:03.130
and then you stretch it or compress it,
the energy goes up like a parabola.

190
00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:08.560
Okay?
Now the slope of that parabola tells you what

191
00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:14.290
the force,
that's what's linear.
As we stretch it further and further,

192
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:18.760
the slope gets bigger.
The force is proportional to the displacement,

193
00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:21.780
okay?
Now they're put,

194
00:13:21.781 --> 00:13:25.240
there could be other kinds of forest laws like electrical charges,

195
00:13:25.241 --> 00:13:27.700
Kula more gravity.
Okay?

196
00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:32.890
So that's a different forest law in diverse square force law.

197
00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:38.470
And the energy then is proportional to uh,
the displacement,

198
00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:43.180
okay?
In this way,
so very different.

199
00:13:43.181 --> 00:13:47.080
Notice the zero of this one's at the top.
When it's zero defined,

200
00:13:47.081 --> 00:13:48.760
when they're very far apart here,

201
00:13:48.761 --> 00:13:51.790
it's zero when they're at the standard distance,
okay?

202
00:13:51.791 --> 00:13:55.810
So as you bring charged oppositely charged particles forever together,

203
00:13:56.350 --> 00:14:00.940
the energy goes down infinitely as they get really close,
okay?

204
00:14:00.941 --> 00:14:04.870
And now if we look at the forest here,
as we go out,
the forest gets smaller,

205
00:14:04.871 --> 00:14:08.050
the slope gets smaller,
okay?

206
00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:13.300
Now suppose you had a particle that was connected to a spring on each side as in

207
00:14:13.301 --> 00:14:15.970
this chain that we're stretching.
And just to be general,

208
00:14:15.971 --> 00:14:20.120
I made the second string,
uh,
oh,
I say stronger.

209
00:14:20.121 --> 00:14:24.340
It's in fact weaker,
right?
It doesn't go up as rapidly.
I'll have to change that.

210
00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:26.290
Okay.
Now,

211
00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:31.290
but at some point the slopes of the red and the blue at some distance,

212
00:14:32.081 --> 00:14:36.580
some position will be equal and opposite there.

213
00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:40.870
Okay.
What's the force on the PR?
The central particle at that point?

214
00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.290
Zero.
They balanced,
right?

215
00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:49.620
So if we add those two energies together to get the sum of the two on the

216
00:14:50.411 --> 00:14:54.890
central,
it looks like that.
Okay,

217
00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.530
so there's a balance to minimum.

218
00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:01.910
There's a well defined position where the particle in the center of this chain,

219
00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:06.830
we'll just sit there and it'll be hard to display so it can vibrate.

220
00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:10.760
Okay.
Now how about in the other case?

221
00:15:10.761 --> 00:15:14.530
How about if it were electrical charges or gravity or something like that and

222
00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:17.000
inverse square law that's holding things together.

223
00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:21.440
Then the second one is going to look like that and that one is indeed stronger.

224
00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:25.460
So there are two flanking bodies and we're interested in the position to the one

225
00:15:25.461 --> 00:15:28.280
in the middle,
right.
And again,

226
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:32.750
there'll be some point where they balance right there.
Okay.

227
00:15:32.751 --> 00:15:34.640
Where they're equal and opposite slopes.

228
00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:36.980
How will this differ from the first case?

229
00:15:36.981 --> 00:15:39.680
Can you see what's going to happen when we add these two together

230
00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.590
because they're going to look more or less like the one on the left.

231
00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:53.380
It's going to look like that and now there is no balanced minimum in the middle.

232
00:15:55.131 --> 00:15:59.390
There is not a position where the thing will just sit there because it's always

233
00:15:59.391 --> 00:16:04.391
more strongly effected and attracted by the one that's closer to,

234
00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:10.790
there's some place where there's zero force but it's not a stable position as if

235
00:16:10.791 --> 00:16:13.820
it displaces ever so slightly.
It'll keep on going.

236
00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:20.020
So that one is for the two of them is a single minimum and this one is a double

237
00:16:20.031 --> 00:16:23.810
minimum.
And for the people who came early,

238
00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.950
there was a contest that if you want it,

239
00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:32.480
you could get an a in the course.
And the contest is this,

240
00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:38.600
here's a magnet
hanging here

241
00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:46.970
and I'll stop it.

242
00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:58.910
Okay.
And here are two magnets,
the ones that will flank that one.

243
00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:03.620
And if I get it just right,
it'll just sit there.
Right.

244
00:17:03.621 --> 00:17:05.300
The attraction to the two will balance.

245
00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:12.170
I'll put it on here
and try to get my a,

246
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:24.350
so I'll get this drain where it would balance right there.

247
00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:45.110
Ah,
okay.

248
00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.950
There is no stable position.
Nobody got there a that

249
00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:54.870
right,
because it's at the end of verse law,
right?

250
00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:00.450
So it's always more strongly attracted to the closer thing,
right?

251
00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:05.100
So you can't win with that.
You can't get a balanced position.

252
00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:10.830
Let me get these off here
and back to the show.

253
00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:28.810
So with springs,

254
00:18:28.811 --> 00:18:33.040
you might be able to make a stable polyatomic molecule from point Adams.

255
00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:36.430
We saw a spring model before in the last lecture,

256
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:41.500
but you can't do it with ions and you can't do it with magnets.

257
00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.230
However,
Hooke's law can't do it.

258
00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:49.690
Can't be springs because Hooke's law never breaks.

259
00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:55.000
So we need a different kind of force law.
Can anybody,

260
00:18:55.001 --> 00:18:58.240
does anybody know a forest law that what it looks like?

261
00:18:58.241 --> 00:19:02.020
The form of the forest between the atoms or the energy for stretching a bond?

262
00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:05.170
You ever seen a picture of such a thing?

263
00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:08.920
It's called the Morris potential,

264
00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:11.650
or one form of it at least is called the Morris potential.

265
00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:14.860
And it's not something fundamental.
It's not a law of nature.

266
00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:19.480
It was thought up by a physicist at Princeton in 1929 because it's

267
00:19:19.481 --> 00:19:21.010
mathematically convenience.

268
00:19:21.011 --> 00:19:24.790
So you could solve quantum mechanical problems if he used Morris potentials.

269
00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:29.770
Okay.
And the idea is this,
you have two neighbors,
right?

270
00:19:29.771 --> 00:19:33.340
And you look at the position to the one on the right and it could be there and

271
00:19:33.341 --> 00:19:36.580
the energy would be minimum.
That's the bond distance,
right?

272
00:19:36.581 --> 00:19:39.790
And if you move it further to the right,
the energy goes up,
move it to the left,

273
00:19:39.791 --> 00:19:43.690
the energy goes up.
Okay,
that's the more potential.
And we're just holding the,

274
00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:45.490
the neighbor on the left fixed.

275
00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:49.210
Now we could put another neighbor on the other side,
right?

276
00:19:49.211 --> 00:19:53.050
And have another curve of the same sort that re that's stretching the second

277
00:19:53.051 --> 00:19:57.220
bond.
Or we could have it be a chain and have both neighbors there.

278
00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:01.030
Right?
And the sum of those two now has a minimum in the middle.

279
00:20:01.031 --> 00:20:03.880
It's a single minimum,
like we got with Hooke's law.

280
00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:08.840
So that means that Adam in the middle would just stay there and now we're going

281
00:20:08.841 --> 00:20:12.880
to grab those sticks on either side and pull the neighbors apart.

282
00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.570
So if we pull them apart,
it's still a single minimum.

283
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:21.510
And if we pull them apart further,
it's still a single minimum,

284
00:20:21.511 --> 00:20:25.500
although it's very flat.
And if we pull it further,

285
00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:30.180
it pops and it becomes a double minimum.
And if we keep going,

286
00:20:30.181 --> 00:20:34.500
the double minimum gets more pronounced.
Now here's an interesting question.

287
00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:39.660
At what point,
how far do you have to stretch it before it pops?

288
00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:41.970
That's the question we were asking,
right?

289
00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:48.440
How can you look at those curves and tell how far apart you have to stretch it

290
00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:52.180
before the chain pops?

291
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.020
What do you mean flat?
There's a name for a thing like that in the graph.

292
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.750
It's the inflection point.
It's when the curvature changes from being this way,

293
00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:18.940
like Hooke's law to being this way,
right?

294
00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:24.430
So when the inflection points cross them,
the chain pops.
Okay,

295
00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.940
so forest laws are going to make a lot of difference in how atoms behave.

296
00:21:27.941 --> 00:21:30.310
And we real,
if we really knew the forest law,

297
00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:33.280
we'd be in a great position for understanding chemistry.

298
00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:38.310
It snaps at the inflection point where it changes from an direct to an inverse

299
00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:43.300
dependence on distance for force.
Okay,

300
00:21:43.301 --> 00:21:45.820
but what are bonds,
right?
Newton said,

301
00:21:45.821 --> 00:21:49.510
we'll look for the law and it's sort of the law as sorta like Morse,

302
00:21:49.511 --> 00:21:52.420
but we don't know where it came from because we don't know how it works.

303
00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:57.340
We don't know what it really is.
So can we find out what it really is?
Well,

304
00:21:57.341 --> 00:22:01.420
in the 19th century they discovered bonds,

305
00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:06.190
right?
And this is a picture from 1861 we'll talk about this later.

306
00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:10.990
And it's one of the first depictions that's recognizable by people today of

307
00:22:10.991 --> 00:22:12.460
bonds between atoms.

308
00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:18.630
So there are different numbers of these lines violences for different atoms.

309
00:22:19.331 --> 00:22:23.290
Hydrogen has one,
carbon has four oxygen to nitrogen,
three.

310
00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:28.600
Right?
Why do the elements differ?
Why don't they all have the same valence?

311
00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:32.470
Right?
And even more complicated.

312
00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:37.770
Sometimes nitrogen is three and sometimes it's five for example,

313
00:22:38.351 --> 00:22:39.640
you have Nh three,

314
00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:45.070
but you also have Nh four cl where there five things associated with the

315
00:22:45.071 --> 00:22:49.930
nitrogen.
Right?
So how do you understand the valence?

316
00:22:49.931 --> 00:22:54.220
That was the challenge for people.
They had figured out that there was valence,

317
00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:58.480
but why?
How could you predict the valence of a new element?

318
00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:01.540
Well,
Gertrude and Robin,

319
00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:06.570
Robert Robinson published a paper in 1977 17 which showed this picture of

320
00:23:08.021 --> 00:23:11.830
ammonia Nh three.
What's the loop?

321
00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:14.703
Pardon me?

322
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:20.500
Someone's holding your hand up so people can hear you.
Okay.
Yes.

323
00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:25.210
A lone pair on nitrogen wrong.

324
00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:28.420
It looks like the lone bear on nitrogen,

325
00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:32.590
but the loan period didn't come along that soon.

326
00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:36.370
What the loop means,
if you look at it in a context,

327
00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:40.730
is what makes Nh three reactive.
In this term,

328
00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:41.830
this is what they wrote.

329
00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:47.280
It may reasonably be assumed that the partial dissociation is a stage in the

330
00:23:49.491 --> 00:23:50.870
complete process.

331
00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:56.000
So the bonds begin to break this loop because the break to become a weeper loop

332
00:23:56.030 --> 00:24:00.080
and two other partial valence in this theory,

333
00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:05.770
and those valances begin to associate with partial valence from hcl.

334
00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:14.310
That's called the loop is a latent valence.
You know what latent means?

335
00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:18.600
Latent is the opposite of Peyton's or patent.

336
00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:22.950
Latent means hidden.
Patent is revealed.

337
00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:25.710
When you get a patent on something,

338
00:24:25.711 --> 00:24:27.750
it means that you tell everybody how to do it,

339
00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:31.890
but the government protects your right to do it for a certain period of time.

340
00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:36.840
Late means it's hidden.
So there's a hidden valence,
these loops,

341
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:41.490
but they could become available,
right?
It must be assumed.

342
00:24:41.491 --> 00:24:42.600
Some cases,
there's,
for example,

343
00:24:42.601 --> 00:24:46.050
the combination of ammonia with hydrochloric acid.
Now,

344
00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:48.570
so you get a reaction and get the product,

345
00:24:48.571 --> 00:24:51.150
which has all five valence as of nitrogen now,

346
00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:57.300
but how do you know there's not another loop on nitrogen that you could break

347
00:24:57.301 --> 00:25:00.990
open and make it seven valence or nine or 11

348
00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:04.740
or maybe you could break a loop into three.

349
00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:06.623
<v 1>Right?</v>

350
00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:10.130
<v 0>So Mike Layton Valence loop explained the tribe,</v>

351
00:25:10.131 --> 00:25:15.000
valence and pentavalent of nitrogen or the Amine Hcl reactivity.

352
00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:19.140
The trouble is it's too slippery a concept and explains everything.

353
00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:20.730
You could explain anything you wanted to.

354
00:25:20.731 --> 00:25:24.360
You could just play an 84 valence of nitrogen or something.
Right?

355
00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:27.630
Anything that comes along and say,
Aha there that many latent valence is,

356
00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:32.610
but how do you know they're not more right?
Why do you have late and says,

357
00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:34.080
when do you have them?

358
00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:38.220
Right when and why do you have partial dissociation?

359
00:25:38.221 --> 00:25:41.520
This thing didn't explain anything or explained everything.

360
00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:49.070
Now at this point,
I want you to smile so I can learn who you are.

361
00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:53.283
<v 1>Okay?</v>

362
00:25:56.630 --> 00:26:00.530
<v 0>So I've got to go see the,
see the ivory is here.</v>

363
00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:07.550
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

364
00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:21.940
<v 0>last year I had to do this twice because by hands shook first.</v>

365
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:31.260
<v 1>Okay.</v>

366
00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:32.820
<v 0>No,
I have to get your people back here</v>

367
00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:39.870
someday I'll get a fancier Cameron single shot.
We'll do the whole thing.

368
00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:41.933
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

369
00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:50.400
I don't know if I got you here.

370
00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:56.210
[inaudible] big smile

371
00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:04.933
and

372
00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:11.130
I don't know if I can get you all in one and not quite get you all by yourself.

373
00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:17.100
[inaudible]

374
00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:22.040
<v 0>people from Hawaii.
Very distinguished.
Okay,</v>

375
00:27:22.041 --> 00:27:22.874
thank you.

376
00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:42.380
So the electron was discovered in 1897

377
00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:46.520
right?
So maybe that has something to do with it.

378
00:27:46.521 --> 00:27:50.900
And the guy who associated electrons with valence was GN Lewis.

379
00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:56.180
And this is a picture of him as a Harvard undergraduate in 1894

380
00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:02.720
and this is eight years later when he was an instructor at Harvard.

381
00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:06.620
And he then went to establish the chemistry department at the University of

382
00:28:06.621 --> 00:28:07.760
California at Berkeley.

383
00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:17.050
But when he was at Harvard in 19 two he had,

384
00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:22.030
he used these lecture notes and what he was trying to explain was the periodic

385
00:28:22.031 --> 00:28:23.650
table,
right?

386
00:28:23.651 --> 00:28:27.280
Why you go across in aid and then another eight and another eight and so on.

387
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:29.620
Right?
And how,

388
00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:33.460
why you have electron transfers from some atoms to other atoms.

389
00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:39.570
And he said if the electrons in an atom are arranged at the corners of a cube,

390
00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:45.490
then you at eight is this very special number cause that occupies all the

391
00:28:45.491 --> 00:28:47.650
corners of the cube,
right?

392
00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:51.730
So if there's a desire for some reason to complete octets,

393
00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:57.580
then you could explain periodicity and see why some atoms give up an electron to

394
00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:01.690
lose the outer shell and others gained,
wanted to complete the outer shell.

395
00:29:04.090 --> 00:29:04.901
Okay.
So,

396
00:29:04.901 --> 00:29:09.901
but it also could explain how you get bonding if you like to have octets not

397
00:29:11.741 --> 00:29:16.420
just electron transfer,
but the formation of covalent bonds.
So for example,

398
00:29:16.421 --> 00:29:21.310
here's two chlorine's.
Each has only seven.
The octet isn't complete.

399
00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.910
But if you bring them together and they share an edge,

400
00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:28.600
then both octets are complete.

401
00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:33.940
He doesn't say why octets should be so great.
But if they're octets,

402
00:29:33.941 --> 00:29:37.990
then you could explain the bonds.
How about double bonds?

403
00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:43.630
Suppose you had two oxygen atoms.
What do you do now?
Anybody?

404
00:29:43.631 --> 00:29:47.980
See?
Yup.
Put the faces to put faces together.

405
00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:52.690
Share two edges,
right?
And then both have an octet.

406
00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:57.640
Now suppose you want to put nitrogens together and form a triple bond.

407
00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:03.200
Now how do you do it?
Push it hard.

408
00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:08.410
Force it like a picture puzzle.
Yes,
put it in there.

409
00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:12.310
[inaudible] won't do it.

410
00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:18.130
But in,
but about 10 years later,
he figured out how to do it.

411
00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:23.800
What you do is take the electrons,
nitrogen has five,

412
00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:27.160
but instead of using an octet,

413
00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:30.760
you can track that along opposing edges this way.

414
00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:36.130
So what was the knock tete?
What was a cube?
Becomes what

415
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:38.770
a tetrahedron,

416
00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:42.940
and now if you take two tetrahedron,

417
00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:47.440
you can put a face together and complete both octets,

418
00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:51.610
but this wasn't such a great development.

419
00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:56.820
He did this and publish this at 1916 but the tetrahedral distribution of the

420
00:30:57.791 --> 00:31:02.791
bonds in carbon had been known by organic chemists for 40 years by that time

421
00:31:03.401 --> 00:31:06.610
that the tetrahedron was a very important structure.

422
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.930
<v 1>Okay,</v>

423
00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:13.610
<v 0>so a good theory should be realistic and it should be simple,</v>

424
00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:16.970
but there's a tension between these things.

425
00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:21.320
It should at least be as simple as possible,
right?

426
00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:24.920
But that may not be very simple.
That's why it takes us five weeks.

427
00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:27.253
<v 1>Okay.</v>

428
00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:30.580
<v 0>In regard to the facts,
it should allow a number of properties.</v>

429
00:31:30.581 --> 00:31:35.380
It should allow prediction.
You should be able to say,
how will these atoms react?

430
00:31:35.381 --> 00:31:39.430
How will this molecule react?
Right?
What valence should nitrogen have?

431
00:31:39.431 --> 00:31:43.390
How could it be both pentavalent and and try Vaillant?

432
00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:49.450
Little below this on the scale of desirability is suggestion.
A theory may,

433
00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:51.640
even if it doesn't give you the proper thing,

434
00:31:51.641 --> 00:31:55.450
may at least suggest some experiment that would be really good to do.

435
00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:01.450
Below that is explanation.
Right?
According to my theory,

436
00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:06.430
all these known facts fit together,
but who knows about any new thing.

437
00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:13.680
And the lowest is classification and remembering like you know,

438
00:32:13.681 --> 00:32:17.100
Roy g bev allows you to remember the colors of the spectrum,

439
00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:21.210
but there's nothing fundamental about that.
So even if you have a crummy thing,

440
00:32:21.211 --> 00:32:25.140
it might allow you to help at least remember some facts,
organize them,
maybe.

441
00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:31.260
Okay,
but those last two are not prediction there.
Post diction,

442
00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:35.730
you only use it to explain things that are already known as a way of remembering

443
00:32:35.731 --> 00:32:40.070
them.
So from the number of electrons,

444
00:32:40.071 --> 00:32:42.220
we'd like to predict how,

445
00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:46.190
how many atoms of different types come together to form molecules.

446
00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:50.780
That's constitution,
the nature and the sequence of bonds.

447
00:32:50.781 --> 00:32:54.620
And the valence.
We'd like to know the structure of molecules,

448
00:32:54.621 --> 00:32:56.450
the distance between Adams angles.

449
00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:00.590
We'd like to know how charges distributed within molecules.

450
00:33:00.591 --> 00:33:02.600
Are some regions positive and others negative.

451
00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:05.300
We'd like to know what the energy of the molecule is.

452
00:33:05.301 --> 00:33:08.900
Is this arrangement of the atoms better or worse than an alternative
arrangement?

453
00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:12.110
Right?
And we'd like to know about reactivity.

454
00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:18.650
So Louis Explains Constitution,
the nature and the sequence of bonds,

455
00:33:18.651 --> 00:33:20.750
nature of the beans,
like single,
double,
triple,

456
00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:25.910
and sequence means which atoms are connected to which,
okay,

457
00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:29.720
so he has electrons,
valence,

458
00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:34.160
and also he added unshared payers,
right?

459
00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:39.020
So you count up how many from the atomic weight or the atomic number of the

460
00:33:39.021 --> 00:33:42.320
position of the periodic table.
You get how many valence electrons,

461
00:33:42.321 --> 00:33:46.760
how many of these outer octet are there?
And then you can figure that the,

462
00:33:46.761 --> 00:33:50.120
the valence of hydrogens should be one bar on three carbon four.

463
00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:53.780
But then down again,
three,
two,
one.
Okay.

464
00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:59.260
So here's ammonia and h one and three were expanding that has an unshared pair.

465
00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:03.260
But why do you have octets?

466
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:07.310
Why not sextets right?

467
00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:12.230
And why do you have a pair for hydrogen?

468
00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:15.260
Why not an octet for hydrogen also?

469
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:20.570
Okay,
so let's just apply it to HCN.

470
00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:26.710
So carbon has four and that means possible to make a single bond to hydrogen,

471
00:34:27.741 --> 00:34:29.030
a triple bond to carbon.

472
00:34:29.031 --> 00:34:32.660
Everybody has their octet except hydrogen that only wants to,

473
00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:37.700
so everybody's happy and we can abbreviate it this way and leave the dot.

474
00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:42.020
Louis actually thought of draw drawing a coal and a pair of dots to denote an

475
00:34:42.021 --> 00:34:46.370
unshared bear.
So that's his notation.
So NH three.

476
00:34:47.390 --> 00:34:52.100
Bingo.
How about Bh three?
Just fine.

477
00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:56.810
But here's something new.
The organic chemist would already have known this.

478
00:34:56.811 --> 00:35:00.770
They knew the valence numbers,
the electrons just added something to it,

479
00:35:00.771 --> 00:35:02.570
but didn't say anything really new.

480
00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:07.840
But here's something new that Bh three reacts with Nh three

481
00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:15.440
to give a new bond.
Okay?
Now here's a puzzle.

482
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:21.310
It's also true that Bh three reacts with Bh Three.

483
00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:27.920
That doesn't look like Louis.
Okay?
So we'll,

484
00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:31.070
uh,
and the bond is reasonably strong.

485
00:35:31.071 --> 00:35:34.580
It's half as strong as a carbon carbon bond.
Okay?

486
00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:39.960
So what's the glue that holds B h six together?
And we'll come back to that,

487
00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:42.300
uh,
14 lectures from now.

488
00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:45.300
But there's another thing,

489
00:35:45.301 --> 00:35:49.710
there's bookkeeping that you do with Lewis structures to assign what's called

490
00:35:49.711 --> 00:35:52.320
formal charges,
not real charges,

491
00:35:52.321 --> 00:35:56.490
just what charges you right in the formula.
And you hope they mean something.

492
00:35:57.330 --> 00:36:02.330
And the bookkeeping scheme you used is that each Adam is assigned half interest

493
00:36:02.671 --> 00:36:07.080
in the bonding pair.
So if there's a bonding pair for bookkeeping purposes,

494
00:36:07.081 --> 00:36:08.820
you assign one electron to each.

495
00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:12.750
It may be they aren't evenly shared that the bookkeepers don't care.

496
00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:18.220
Incidentally,
speaking of bookkeepers not caring,
there's a,
uh,

497
00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:22.050
people have had a lot of nonsense trying to get signed up for lab,

498
00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:26.690
uh,
because the people who run the system,
uh,

499
00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:29.520
don't allow teachers to have to have,
uh,

500
00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:33.480
access to the thing to see the problems you faced.
So I have no way of telling,

501
00:36:33.481 --> 00:36:34.830
I can't get onto your system.

502
00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:37.620
Has everybody figured out how to sign up for lab by now?

503
00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:41.190
If anybody still has problems after class,

504
00:36:41.191 --> 00:36:45.350
Dr the Maglio can take you to the computer center here and help you.
So,
uh,

505
00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:50.190
next year,
presumably it'll be easier.
This is a new system this year.
But anyhow,

506
00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:53.940
back to the bookkeepers here.
Uh,
this,

507
00:36:53.941 --> 00:36:57.150
so these formal charges are not necessarily real charges.

508
00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:01.260
They're just what you write.
Do you draw the formula?
Okay,

509
00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:06.410
so we split the V and electrons between the be in the end and we split the

510
00:37:07.381 --> 00:37:09.600
hydrogen bonds as well.

511
00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:14.870
So nitrogen now has those four electrons where it brought five to the table

512
00:37:16.651 --> 00:37:21.330
originally,
right?
So it has a positive charge.

513
00:37:21.331 --> 00:37:26.310
Tetra Vaillant nitrogen is positive in the Lewis structure.
Why?

514
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.130
Because in forming the fourth bond,

515
00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:32.670
it gave up half interest in one of its electrons,

516
00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:34.860
the ones in the unshared pair,

517
00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:40.050
so it lost the charge and negative charge and becomes positive by the same
token.

518
00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:41.730
What else can you write in this structure

519
00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:48.000
that is negative,
a negative charge on Boron,
right?

520
00:37:48.001 --> 00:37:52.290
Cause it got half interest in a pair,
but that's just bookkeeping.

521
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.040
So when you write a Lewis structure,

522
00:37:56.041 --> 00:38:00.480
you'd write plus on nitrogen and minus on Boron.
Okay.

523
00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:02.190
Now is it real?

524
00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:07.200
Is there a positive charge on nitrogen and negative charge on Boron?

525
00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:12.480
Well,
we'll get later on to to know about what a surface potential is.

526
00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:17.840
Surface potential is the energy of Proton would have if it was on different

527
00:38:18.271 --> 00:38:22.140
points on the molecular surface.
For this purpose,

528
00:38:22.141 --> 00:38:25.860
you have to define what the surface is of of a,

529
00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:31.320
B and h six.
Right?
There's a way of doing that.

530
00:38:31.321 --> 00:38:33.900
We won't talk about it now that's jumping the gun.

531
00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:39.320
But that's the surface and it's color coded to show the energy of Proton would

532
00:38:41.081 --> 00:38:43.840
have if it were on the surface at that point.

533
00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:50.040
So what you see is that the energy of the Proton would be high if it's here

534
00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:51.580
where it's very blue,

535
00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:56.140
the energy of the Proton would be low if it's in this region here,

536
00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:00.880
right?
Is that consistent with what we were talking about?

537
00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:03.153
Where would,

538
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:08.670
where would a proton be low in energy where there's negative charge and it would

539
00:39:09.251 --> 00:39:12.880
be high in energy when there's positive charge.
So this molecule,

540
00:39:12.881 --> 00:39:17.650
according to quantum mechanics is positive on the left and negative on the
right.

541
00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:22.870
Right.
And that's exactly what we had,
right?
It's consistent with what we had.

542
00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:28.380
And now Louis also explains where pentavalent nitrogen comes from because as an

543
00:39:29.231 --> 00:39:32.200
ionic bond there to Tetra Vale nitrogens plus.

544
00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:37.420
So there's just the Kula big attraction between ammonium and chloride.

545
00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:39.610
So that's a great contribution.
Now,

546
00:39:39.611 --> 00:39:42.370
there are other things you can understand in terms of Lewis structures,

547
00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:47.110
like you have an Amit and it can react with an oxygen to give an amine oxide,

548
00:39:47.111 --> 00:39:49.840
which is positive on nitrogen,
negative on oxygen.

549
00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:56.130
Or you can have a sulfide which can react with an oxygen to give us sulfoxide or

550
00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:02.710
what else could happen
with the sulfur.

551
00:40:02.890 --> 00:40:04.210
What additionally could happen,

552
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:10.000
it could do another oxygen and give a sole phone as it's called.

553
00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:13.210
Okay,
so Louis explains this.

554
00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:19.540
So there are problems to drill on Lewis structures right there on the web.

555
00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:20.643
Go look at them.

556
00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:26.280
One of them is draw a Lewis dot structures for h n c in that order age then,

557
00:40:27.321 --> 00:40:31.990
and we did HCN but do HNC.
Okay.

558
00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:37.420
And then try HCN.
Oh,
with CNO in all six linear orders,

559
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:40.600
right?
That is nitrogen in the middle of carbon in the middle,

560
00:40:40.601 --> 00:40:43.780
oxygen in the middle,
and then hydrogen on either end.

561
00:40:44.350 --> 00:40:48.460
And it's also possible to make a ring of CNO and put the hydrogen on any of the

562
00:40:48.461 --> 00:40:51.700
positions.
So just practice drawing Lewis structures of those.

563
00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:56.200
Okay.
And start memorizing functional groups.

564
00:40:56.320 --> 00:41:00.400
We do precious little memorizing in this course compared to most organic

565
00:41:00.401 --> 00:41:01.270
chemistry courses.

566
00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:05.440
We try to figure out how things work so that you can get without memorizing it,

567
00:41:06.310 --> 00:41:09.970
but there's some things you have to know like the names of groups.

568
00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:13.360
Otherwise we takes forever to talk about them.
Okay,

569
00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:17.460
so here are the ones you have to learn.
And on the first exam,
uh,

570
00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:19.540
coming up in three weeks or whatever,

571
00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:23.860
I'll give you a question where you have to draw one of these structures from the

572
00:41:23.861 --> 00:41:26.890
name or give the name for a structure.

573
00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:29.620
These are all on the webpage and I have to copy them down,

574
00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:33.380
but those are simple functional groups.
Okay.

575
00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:37.220
Hey on here are,
whoops.
Oh,
sorry.

576
00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:45.250
There they're also conjugated functional groups so you can see if you can run it

577
00:41:45.291 --> 00:41:46.880
yourself.
Okay.

578
00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:51.940
Now the final question here for today is a thing that comes up when you talk

579
00:41:53.421 --> 00:41:55.640
about Lewis structures or structures in general.

580
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:59.330
Lewis structures in particular is equilibrium and resonance.

581
00:41:59.331 --> 00:42:01.280
How many people know what residents is?

582
00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:05.793
<v 1>What is it?</v>

583
00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:11.620
Speak up a little bit please.

584
00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:18.870
<v 0>Same molecule but different structure,
but it isn't structure molecule.</v>

585
00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:25.150
If you don't mind,
let me just interject a minute here.

586
00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:28.810
It's like one of the problems is HCN.
Oh,
in any order,
right?

587
00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:32.830
So there would be different molecules with sea in the middle and in the middle.

588
00:42:32.831 --> 00:42:34.930
Oh,
in the middle.
Is that what you mean?

589
00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:44.800
Huh?
Now let's actually,

590
00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:50.340
resonance is one of those things where people try to hide ignorance from

591
00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:55.120
ignominy and let me show you what I mean by that.
So here's,

592
00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:58.300
here's a structure for HCN.
Oh,
right.

593
00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:04.360
And here it has all octets.
If you go through,
you'll figure that out.

594
00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:09.850
It has charged separation though.
You don't like to have that in your structures.

595
00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:12.070
You'd like not to have charges.

596
00:43:12.071 --> 00:43:17.071
If you can avoid obviously be n h six you can't avoid it.

597
00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:19.721
Okay?
Now,

598
00:43:19.721 --> 00:43:23.440
but you can get rid of the charge separation by shifting that electron pair

599
00:43:23.441 --> 00:43:26.800
that's on oxygen to be shared between oxygen and nitrogen.

600
00:43:26.801 --> 00:43:30.730
Then you don't have a night the charge on oxygen anymore.
Everybody see that?

601
00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:33.670
And what's the problem when you do that?

602
00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:40.040
Nitrogen now has too many electrons.
So you can shift a pair from the,

603
00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:45.140
that's in the CN bond onto the carbon in your drawing you make,

604
00:43:47.290 --> 00:43:49.570
okay,
so you get this structure shown below,

605
00:43:50.350 --> 00:43:52.300
which has all octets

606
00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:59.250
but they're still charge separation and in fact it's worse because the negative

607
00:43:59.561 --> 00:44:03.760
charge instead of being on oxygen is now on carbon.
Right?

608
00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:06.790
So these two different Lewis structures you could draw in,

609
00:44:06.791 --> 00:44:11.380
each has its own properties.
They are good things and bad things.

610
00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:16.920
Now what are the geometric implications of there being two structures?

611
00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:22.960
It couldn't mean that in the middle one and the lower one,

612
00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:27.550
nitrogen is exactly halfway between carbon and oxygen because they're both

613
00:44:27.551 --> 00:44:28.390
double bonds.

614
00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:33.300
But in the top when nitrogen is much closer to and the oxygen right,

615
00:44:33.301 --> 00:44:35.730
that could be the meaning of this

616
00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:44.600
so that if you draw a picture of the energy as a function of the position of the

617
00:44:45.961 --> 00:44:50.910
nitrogen,
you could get two different structures.

618
00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:55.740
One where it's further to the left,
where the nitrogens further to the left,

619
00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:59.310
you have this structure and when the nitrogen is in the middle,

620
00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:03.630
you have that structure and you have to go up hill and energy.

621
00:45:03.631 --> 00:45:06.780
It'll click right.
If you start pushing the nitrogen and starts,
you'll

622
00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:10.530
click,
and that's the other one,
okay?

623
00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:13.350
That could be the way the atoms really behave.

624
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:19.430
That's called a double minimum.
We already saw a double minimum today,
okay?

625
00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:23.130
But maybe in truth,
it's not this way.

626
00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:26.210
Maybe it's a single minimum

627
00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:32.990
may be the best position for the nitrogen is neither to the left nor in the

628
00:45:33.571 --> 00:45:37.110
middle.
But in between.
Maybe that's the lowest energy,

629
00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:41.520
right?
And that is what resonance is.

630
00:45:42.510 --> 00:45:47.280
Resonance is when you,
the true structure is in between the structures you draw,

631
00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:48.960
right?

632
00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:53.960
So really what it is is a failure of the notation

633
00:45:56.770 --> 00:45:57.840
is everybody see how that,

634
00:45:57.841 --> 00:46:02.700
so it's that the notation you use doesn't show the right structure.

635
00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:08.400
And when that happens,
there's residents,
they're said to be residents,

636
00:46:08.970 --> 00:46:13.020
although actually all it is is that the true structure is a single minimum,

637
00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:16.650
not the double minimum.
You would expect from your drawing.

638
00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:19.110
It's a failure of the way you draw.

639
00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:24.870
And notice that for resonance you use a double headed arrow.

640
00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:30.060
Whereas if I back up a second here,
equilibrium.
When you have a double minimum,

641
00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:34.110
there are two arrows,
right?
Two different structures.

642
00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:35.880
So the question is which is it?

643
00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:41.390
Is the real molecule a double minimum or the real molecules a double minimum?

644
00:46:42.181 --> 00:46:45.780
Are there two structures or is there in truth only one structure?

645
00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:51.720
So you need to choose between the choice between whether there's resonance or

646
00:46:51.721 --> 00:46:56.721
equilibrium must be based on experimental facts or on a theory that's better

647
00:46:57.871 --> 00:47:01.350
than Louis's theory to be able to know which is true.

648
00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:05.880
Something that can distinguish between a single and a double minimum.

649
00:47:06.810 --> 00:47:11.370
So equilibrium is duck two arrows and there are two structures that go back and

650
00:47:11.371 --> 00:47:12.204
forth.

651
00:47:12.570 --> 00:47:17.370
And resonance is a single structure that our notation isn't very good at
drawing.

652
00:47:19.150 --> 00:47:23.700
Okay?
So two real species or one real species,

653
00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:28.850
but to reasonable formulas we could draw for it or that Louis would draw for it.

654
00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:33.340
So really what it is,

655
00:47:33.341 --> 00:47:37.330
resonance is a failure of simplistic notation

656
00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:45.580
and it's associated with unusual stability.

657
00:47:47.830 --> 00:47:48.011
Now,

658
00:47:48.011 --> 00:47:53.011
what I say unusual that implies that you know what usual stability is.

659
00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:00.260
So compared to what is it unusual,

660
00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:03.380
and we'll address that question later on.

661
00:48:05.090 --> 00:48:10.090
So let me just give you finally an example of equilibrium versus resonance.

662
00:48:10.641 --> 00:48:11.091
So this,

663
00:48:11.091 --> 00:48:15.470
as you'll learn when you learn functional groups is a carboxylic acid and you

664
00:48:15.471 --> 00:48:19.340
could have the hydrogen attached to this oxygen or it could be attached to the

665
00:48:19.341 --> 00:48:22.640
other oxygen.
So these are not just the same thing upside down.

666
00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:26.840
It's the hydrogen being attached to one or being attached to the other of the

667
00:48:26.841 --> 00:48:30.620
two oxygens.
And it could in fact it is that way.

668
00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:34.820
There are two structures and you go back and forth between them,
okay,

669
00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:36.950
two species.

670
00:48:39.130 --> 00:48:43.120
But how about if you take the hydrogen atom away and have this thing that's

671
00:48:43.121 --> 00:48:47.860
called a free radical where you don't have a complete octet on this oxygen,

672
00:48:48.450 --> 00:48:52.670
there are only two,
four,
six,
seven electrons there.

673
00:48:52.671 --> 00:48:56.500
It has the ability to form another bond by sharing an electro,
right?

674
00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:58.600
Is that two different species,

675
00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:04.120
or is it one species?
Watch

676
00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:09.700
with an intermediate geometry where you don't really have double and single

677
00:49:09.701 --> 00:49:13.930
bonds,
but something in between.
And how do you know which it is?

678
00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:17.110
The only way is to do some experiment that tells you,

679
00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:21.370
and there is an experiment that tells you it's only one nuclear geometry,

680
00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:26.230
and we don't have time in the last 30 seconds to tell you how that proof works.

681
00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:29.770
But I'll tell you that the technique is electron paramagnetic resonance

682
00:49:29.771 --> 00:49:32.110
spectroscopy shows that in truth,

683
00:49:32.830 --> 00:49:35.410
although this is two species,

684
00:49:36.250 --> 00:49:40.720
this is one species,
so there's equilibrium at the top,

685
00:49:40.721 --> 00:49:41.800
at residence,
at the bottom,

686
00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:45.280
and if you add an extra electron to make a Carbox late,

687
00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:49.960
and ion infrared spectroscopy tells you that it's symmetrical too.

688
00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:53.830
There's resonance in this case,
it's an intermediate structure,

689
00:49:54.850 --> 00:49:58.120
but that is lore,
right?

690
00:49:58.330 --> 00:50:00.970
You didn't predict that from Lewis structure ahead of time.

691
00:50:00.971 --> 00:50:03.670
It could have been either way.
Right?
In fact,

692
00:50:03.671 --> 00:50:05.890
there were many people that thought it was one way or the other.

693
00:50:06.130 --> 00:50:10.600
It's only experiment that does it.
So next time we'll talk more about lore.
