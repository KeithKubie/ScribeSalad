00:00:00.824 --> 00:00:02.240
We're now going
to think about one

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.230
of my most favorite
theorems in mathematics,

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.180
and that's the squeeze theorem.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.460
And one of the reasons that it's
one of my most favorite theorem

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.865
in mathematics is that it
has the word "squeeze" in it,

00:00:13.865 --> 00:00:15.620
a word that you
don't see showing up

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.170
in a lot of mathematics.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.820
But it is appropriately named.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.400
And this is oftentimes also
called the sandwich theorem,

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.190
which is also an appropriate
name, as we'll see in a second.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.320
And since it can be called
the sandwich theorem,

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.730
let's first just
think about an analogy

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.340
to get the intuition behind
the squeeze or the sandwich

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.390
theorem.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.830
Let's say that there
are three people.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:46.420
Let's say that there is
Imran, let's say there's Diya,

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.160
and let's say there is Sal.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.370
And let's say that
Imran, on any given day,

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.880
he always has the fewest
amount of calories.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.300
And Sal, on any
given day, always

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.100
has the most number of calories.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.580
So in a given day,
we can always say

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:15.190
Diya eats at least
as much as Imran.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:22.370
And then we can say Sal eats
at least as much-- that's

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.070
just to repeat those
words-- as Diya.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.400
And so we could set up a
little inequality here.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:35.610
On a given day, we could
write that Imran's calories

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.880
on a given day are going to be
less than or equal to Diya's

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:47.390
calories on that same day,
which is going to be less than

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.650
or equal to Sal's
calories on that same day.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.900
Now let's say that it's Tuesday.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.090
Let's say on
Tuesday you find out

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:11.370
that Imran ate 1,500 calories.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:20.460
And on that same day, Sal
also ate 1,500 calories.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.860
So based on this,
how many calories

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.650
must Diya have eaten that day?

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.730
Well, she always eats at least
as many as Imran's, so she

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.530
ate 1,500 calories or more.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.250
But she always has less than or
equal to the number of calories

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.330
Sal eats.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.094
So it must be less
than or equal to 1,500.

00:02:38.094 --> 00:02:39.510
Well, there's only
one number that

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.930
is greater than or equal
to 1,500 and less than

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.960
or equal to 1,500, and
that is 1,500 calories.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.570
So Diya must have
eaten 1,500 calories.

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.530
This is common sense.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.890
Diya must have had
1,500 calories.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.710
And the squeeze
theorem is essentially

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.740
the mathematical version
of this for functions.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.170
And you could even view this is
Imran's calories as a function

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.800
of the day, Sal's calories
as a function of the day,

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.840
and Diya's calories as
a function of the day

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.410
is always going to
be in between those.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.950
So now let's make this a
little bit more mathematical.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.440
So let me clear this out
so we can have some space

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.430
to do some math in.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.250
So let's say that we
have the same analogy.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.620
So let's say that we
have three functions.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.650
Let's say f of x
over some interval

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.900
is always less
than or equal to g

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.340
of x over that same interval,
which is always less than

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.530
or equal to h of x over
that same interval.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.305
So let me depict
this graphically.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.030
So that is my y-axis.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.770
This is my x-axis.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.940
And I'll just
depict some interval

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.080
in the x-axis right over here.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:12.810
So let's say h of x looks
something like that.

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.190
Let me make it more interesting.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.360
This is the x-axis.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.560
So let's say h of x looks
something like this.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.290
So that's my h of x.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.940
Let's say f of x looks
something like this.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.180
Maybe it does some interesting
things, and then it comes in,

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.260
and then it goes up
like this, so f of x

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.050
looks something like that.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.960
And then g of x,
for any x-value, g

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.297
of x is always in
between these two.

00:04:43.297 --> 00:04:45.380
And I think you see where
the squeeze is happening

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.780
and where the
sandwich is happening.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.300
If h of x and f of x were
bendy pieces of bread, g of x

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.060
would be the meat of the bread.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.660
So it would look
something like this.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.370
Now, let's say that we know--
this is the analogous thing.

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.290
On a particular day, Sal and
Imran ate the same amount.

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.240
Let's say for a
particular x-value,

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.990
the limit as f and h
approach that x-value, they

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.000
approach is the same limit.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.310
So let's take this
x-value right over here.

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.790
Let's say the x-value
is c right over there.

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:23.070
And let's say that
the limit of f

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:34.960
of x as x approaches c is
equal to L. And let's say

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:45.105
that the limit as x approaches
c of h of x is also equal to L.

00:05:45.105 --> 00:05:48.010
So notice, as x
approaches c, h of x

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.100
approaches L. As x approaches
c from either side, f of x

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.560
approaches L.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.484
So these limits
have to be defined.

00:05:55.484 --> 00:05:56.900
Actually, the
functions don't have

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.610
to be defined at x approaches c.

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.240
Just over this
interval, they have

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.120
to be defined as we approach it.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.530
But over this interval,
this has to be true.

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.805
And if these limits right
over here are defined

00:06:06.805 --> 00:06:09.350
and because we know that g
of x is always sandwiched in

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.830
between these two
functions, therefore,

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.530
on that day or
for that x-value--

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.800
I should get out of that
food-eating analogy--

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.910
this tells us if all of this
is true over this interval,

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:31.560
this tells us that the limit
as x approaches c of g of x

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.050
must also be equal to L.

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.280
And once again, this
is common sense.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.750
f of x is approaching
L, h of x is approaching

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.130
L, g of x is sandwiched
in between it.

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:47.444
So it also has to
be approaching L.

00:06:47.444 --> 00:06:49.360
And you might say, well,
this is common sense.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.880
Why is this useful?

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.640
Well, as you'll see, this
is useful for finding

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.830
the limits of some
wacky functions.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.350
If you can find a function
that's always greater than it

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.145
and a function that's
always less than it,

00:07:00.145 --> 00:07:02.270
and you can find the limit
as they approach some c,

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.650
and it's the same
limit, then you

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.490
know that that wacky
function in between

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:09.997
is going to approach
that same limit.
