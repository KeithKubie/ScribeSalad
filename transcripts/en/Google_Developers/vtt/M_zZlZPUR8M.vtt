00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.276
Alexis Moussine-Pouchkine: Hey, everyone.

00:00:01.276 --> 00:00:02.400
We're here at Devoxx 2014.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.792
And I'm here with Tor.

00:00:03.792 --> 00:00:05.500
And we're here to talk
about, guess what?

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.374
Android tooling.

00:00:06.374 --> 00:00:07.040
TOR NORBYE: Yes.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:07.530
MALE SPEAKER: So welcome, Tor .

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:08.270
TOR NORBYE: Thank you.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:09.686
MALE SPEAKER:
You've been covering

00:00:09.686 --> 00:00:12.649
what's new in Android in a
session on Android tooling.

00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:14.190
And then there's
several parts to it.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.070
Obviously, Lollipop
was just released,

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.370
but you're working on
Android Studio, which

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.200
is bringing a whole
lot of new things

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.820
to-- Android developers
to the table.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.330
So built systems, new
features, a lot of new things.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.480
So for those that haven't
been following, maybe

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.892
you can recap where we are.

00:00:30.892 --> 00:00:31.600
TOR NORBYE: Yeah.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.000
So Android Studio
is something we

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.240
announced a couple years now.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.400
And it's a brand new IDE for us.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.070
But it's built on top of
the rock-solid IntelliJ IDE,

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.720
so that gives you sort of very
good job editor and XML editor

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.430
to begin with.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.810
But then we've added some
additional Android features

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.440
to make it more productive
for Android development.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.710
And so that's sort
of the core IDE

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.680
that we're building all these
other extra tools around.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.081
So one of the big
changes in Android Studio

00:00:55.081 --> 00:00:56.830
is that we've added
support for the Gradle

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.430
build system, which adds a lot
of very, very useful features

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.670
for Android developers
in particular.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.390
It makes it very easy to, for
example, with a single source

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.920
base, make your app
target have both

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.130
a free version
and a pro version.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.864
Or you may want to
very easily create

00:01:11.864 --> 00:01:13.780
a beta build that you
distribute to some users

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.840
and then release
build for others.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.840
You can do that very easily.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.640
MALE SPEAKER: So the other,
obviously-- reason you

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.080
would want to have
this is you can

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.229
run your whole build
outside of the IDE.

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.770
Not that the IDE is not good,
but there's so many more things

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.110
you can do when you're--

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.450
TOR NORBYE: Yeah.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.825
I mean, I think it's pretty
well recognized at this point

00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:34.699
that you want to have a
build-- you want to shape APKs

00:01:34.699 --> 00:01:36.240
that you didn't
build on your system.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.930
You want to have it sort of
taken from the build server,

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.450
where you're also
running your tests.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.950
Right?

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.654
Sort of a continuous integration
server where the team sort of

00:01:42.654 --> 00:01:45.070
commits, and it runs and makes
sure that everything is all

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.600
right.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.320
We had a problem before Android
studio and before the Gradle

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.740
build system, where we would
implement one build system

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.170
in Eclipse, and then
we have another one

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.280
from ANT on the command line.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.410
And so they weren't
always the same,

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.080
and it was very difficult
to target the same features.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.663
So now we've sort
of made the decision

00:01:58.663 --> 00:02:00.190
that there is one build system.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.640
And it's used both in the
IDE and on the server.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.810
And that is the Gradle one.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.190
And then we do all this
work on Android Studio

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.500
to sort of make
that work well, so

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.458
that even though the
build system is configured

00:02:08.458 --> 00:02:10.762
with Gradle files, you
don't have to know that.

00:02:10.762 --> 00:02:13.220
You can sit in your IDE, open
up the product search dialog,

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.720
and say, I want to
add a free flavor,

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.810
and I want to add a pro flavor,
and I want to use this version.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:17.705
You can do it all graphically.

00:02:17.705 --> 00:02:18.538
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:02:18.538 --> 00:02:21.517
But if you wanted to get dirty--

00:02:21.517 --> 00:02:22.600
TOR NORBYE: And people do.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.760
I mean, we see a
lot of expert users.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.596
We talk to people who
had hundreds and even

00:02:28.596 --> 00:02:31.220
thousands of line scripts to do
all these complicated packaging

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.720
tasks.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.150
And they can now just replace
it with small Groovy script.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.560
And that's a big win for them.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.393
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:02:37.393 --> 00:02:39.540
So that's the point of
using Gradle in this case.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.550
So Android, at this
point, is at a place

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.280
where you can target
phones and tablets.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.391
And if we stick to that
parameter for a second--

00:02:49.391 --> 00:02:51.640
TOR NORBYE: Phones and tablets
and, you know, watches.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.473
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:02:52.473 --> 00:02:53.280
We'll get to that.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.406
TOR NORBYE: OK.

00:02:53.406 --> 00:02:53.490
All right.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.600
OK.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.620
MALE SPEAKER: Just
phones and tablets.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.810
TOR NORBYE: Yes.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:55.810
Only phones and tablets.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:56.640
That's it.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.100
MALE SPEAKER: No, but
that's a hard job already.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.590
So what kind of support can
you expect in Android Studio

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.010
to help developers develop for
those different form factors?

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.100
And we'll get to wearables
and to other things.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.074
In terms of visual tooling in
terms of hints or, you know.

00:03:15.074 --> 00:03:15.990
TOR NORBYE: That's us.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.948
We have a number of
features to help with this.

00:03:17.948 --> 00:03:21.470
So I think maybe the
most easy to understand

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.350
one is that you can
view your layouts

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.720
graphically inside the IDE.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.400
And we have this feature,
which lets you say, hey,

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.050
I want to see this
layout, but I want

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.540
to see what it's going to look
like in a right-to-left lookout

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.290
and a left-to-right
lookout at the same time.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.320
Or I want to see
with this is going

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.920
look like across different
versions of Android,

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.794
so you can sort of see
both the Material look

00:03:35.794 --> 00:03:37.980
and the Holo look and
even the Gingerbread look.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.520
Or you can say, I want to
see what this layout looks

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.228
like across these
different translations.

00:03:42.228 --> 00:03:44.630
So you can quickly see,
hey, this one language,

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:45.630
my strings are wrapping.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.390
So you can sort of-- in
Android, it's very easy

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.822
to provide resources across
different configurations,

00:03:50.822 --> 00:03:51.780
is what they're called.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.150
Like, an example
of that would be

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.330
like landscape
versus orientation.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.970
You can very easily say, hey,
this is my landscape layout.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.450
This is my portrait layout.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.010
And so we make it very easy
to sort of view all that

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.850
and see what happens to a
layout across these different--

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.776
localization, orientation,
all that stuff.

00:04:05.776 --> 00:04:06.609
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:09.240
So that in itself is
really a useful feature.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.400
So now, of course,
if you add to the mix

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.720
the fact that we have wearables,
and the way you develop

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.490
for wear, Android
wear, specifically,

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:19.470
is by either the
notifications-- but if you

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.110
want to build an
app for Wear, that's

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.190
an APK that's bundled
in the other APK.

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.860
So there's a whole build
system, and Android Studio

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:27.660
helps for that.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.150
TOR NORBYE: That's right.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.700
So there actually is special
support for, for example,

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.614
Android Wear, in the
Android build system.

00:04:32.614 --> 00:04:34.030
And by the Android
build system, I

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.980
mean the Gradle build
system that we've

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.112
extended with an
Android plug-in.

00:04:38.112 --> 00:04:38.820
It's pretty easy.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.160
With a small set of files, you
say, hey, this is a Wear app.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.270
And here's some
additional parameters.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.769
And we will actually
build all this.

00:04:43.769 --> 00:04:45.590
We'll take care of
building the APK,

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.180
like it's bundled
in the other thing.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.971
And we have more features
coming that makes

00:04:48.971 --> 00:04:51.720
this even easier to target,
different variations.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.440
MALE SPEAKER: So how about
other platforms, like Glass or--

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.690
TOR NORBYE: I think those
are all sort of the same use

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:00.231
case from us.

00:05:00.231 --> 00:05:03.095
Like the IDE has certain ways
of previewing Android resources

00:05:03.095 --> 00:05:04.430
so those can be used on Wear.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.220
And we have special
support-- I mean,

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.940
I think one of the
challenges for Wear

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.541
is they also have the round form
factor, which is sort of just

00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:12.290
difficult for tools
to deal with, the fact

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:13.700
that it doesn't
just-- like, hey,

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.283
this is not just a
rectangular window.

00:05:15.283 --> 00:05:16.720
You have to clip
it with a circle.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.380
But we have support for that.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.511
And so I think
Glass and Android TV

00:05:20.511 --> 00:05:22.760
are sort of additional use
cases, where, well, there's

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.926
this special module type
and a special plug-in type.

00:05:24.926 --> 00:05:28.330
And you just get
to act as if it's

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.220
the exact same type of resource
from a usability perspective.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.470
MALE SPEAKER: So
Android 5.0 Lollipop

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.519
is shipping to a number
of devices as we speak.

00:05:36.519 --> 00:05:37.560
TOR NORBYE: That's right.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.226
MALE SPEAKER: Anything
specific in terms

00:05:39.226 --> 00:05:40.980
of support in Android
Studio for that?

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:41.646
TOR NORBYE: Yes.

00:05:41.646 --> 00:05:45.539
So there were a lot of new APIs,
obviously, in every release.

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:47.580
But in this release,
there's a lot of new support

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.570
to deal with animations.

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.800
And, for example,
there's vectors,

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.759
and there's ripples, and
all these new things.

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:55.300
And you need editor
support for that.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.760
And we have that.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:56.260
Right.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.125
So you get code completion
in these new resource files.

00:05:59.125 --> 00:06:00.000
We do XML validation.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.916
So if you have a mistake,
we'll tell you that.

00:06:01.916 --> 00:06:04.136
We'll tell you if you
are, for example, adding

00:06:04.136 --> 00:06:06.510
a vector in a resource file
that isn't Lollipop-specific,

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.110
because that could
be a runtime crash.

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.740
So we have a lot of support
for all the new editor APIs.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.710
MALE SPEAKER: So you have a lot
of support in terms of hints

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.100
or whatever you call those.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.485
TOR NORBYE: That as well.

00:06:15.485 --> 00:06:15.870
Yeah.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.828
MALE SPEAKER: So for a
lot of different things,

00:06:17.828 --> 00:06:18.890
not just Lollipops.

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:20.890
If you add those to
everything you already have,

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:24.210
is that the kind of information
that could be available

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.680
and generated in the
continuous build, for example?

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.431
Or is that surface-only
in the IDE itself?

00:06:29.431 --> 00:06:30.055
TOR NORBYE: No.

00:06:30.055 --> 00:06:30.950
This-- well, I mean--

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:32.325
MALE SPEAKER: For
somebody moving

00:06:32.325 --> 00:06:35.450
to Android Studio, for example,
or moving from a different tool

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:35.950
chain.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:36.991
TOR NORBYE: That's right.

00:06:36.991 --> 00:06:39.781
So some of the
features are in Lint,

00:06:39.781 --> 00:06:41.280
and those run from
the command line.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.240
So obviously, if you're
running Lint in IDE,

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.310
you get quick fixes.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:46.180
But if you run it
on the command line,

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.850
you get an HTML
report, for example.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.571
So you can absolutely get that
in the command line server.

00:06:50.571 --> 00:06:52.070
Some of these
features are obviously

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.819
going to be IDE-specific,
for example, code completion.

00:06:54.819 --> 00:06:56.610
But there's also some
of these inspections,

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:58.310
which are running
only in the IDE.

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:59.934
And the reason for
that is that they're

00:06:59.934 --> 00:07:02.550
taking advantage of a
lot of IntelliJ-specific

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.072
specific support that we can't
actually run outside the IDE.

00:07:06.072 --> 00:07:07.780
So you definitely want
to actually try it

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.490
in the IDE as well, not
just from the command line.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:10.490
MALE SPEAKER: Of course.

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:13.230
TOR NORBYE: Even no matter how
much you love Emacs and Vi.

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:17.800
MALE SPEAKER: So we are
talking about an IDE that

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.810
has not reached 1.0 just yet.

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:20.310
So what--

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:21.230
TOR NORBYE: Just yet.

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:21.640
MALE SPEAKER: Just yet.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:21.840
OK.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:22.315
Tell us more about it.

00:07:22.315 --> 00:07:24.106
TOR NORBYE: We are
getting extremely close.

00:07:24.106 --> 00:07:28.420
So the current version
number is 0.93.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:33.400
And so, simple math,
we're 0.7 away from 1.0.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.020
And we don't generally want
to do it that accurately.

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.940
But we are now really
kind of considering

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.270
the next few builds
release candidates.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.100
MALE SPEAKER: So
the beta release

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.050
was back at Google I/O in June.

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:45.400
TOR NORBYE: That's right.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.900
MALE SPEAKER: And a number of
things changed in terms of you

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.357
couldn't allow yourself to
have block breaking changes.

00:07:50.357 --> 00:07:51.440
What will change with 1.0?

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.330
TOR NORBYE: We've
done that anyway.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:52.750
MALE SPEAKER: You've done that.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.970
TOR NORBYE: We've
added-- our goal really

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:58.620
for 1.0 was to both be
stable and feature complete.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:01.160
And so we, for example, have
changed the Gradle plug-in

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:01.660
quite a bit.

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.300
Like we've actually
changed APIs,

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.560
which were a bit
painful for our users.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.820
That meant that
if you were using

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.640
some of these early builds, you
may have had to actually update

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.220
your build files as you got
new versions of the IDE.

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:11.410
We plan to stop that at 1.0.

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:13.537
We want to make these
APIs more stable.

00:08:13.537 --> 00:08:16.120
And if we, for some reason, have
to change them in the future,

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.680
we'll do more work
to help migrate.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.292
Right.

00:08:19.292 --> 00:08:21.750
But we've also added some new
features to address feedback.

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:22.250
Right.

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:23.940
So we have a
brand-new AVD manager

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.481
that's going to try
to make it easier

00:08:25.481 --> 00:08:27.380
to set up an AVD, a
virtual device that

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:28.600
is configured to run fast.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.334
So we'll make sure
that if you're on x86,

00:08:30.334 --> 00:08:32.500
we'll use the x86 system
image and all these things.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:33.737
Right.

00:08:33.737 --> 00:08:35.570
It was very easy in the
past to accidentally

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:36.610
set up a very slow emulator.

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:38.070
And we're trying
to streamline that.

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:39.020
And there's a number
of other features

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.830
we've added as well to sort
of address our 1.0 desires.

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:43.440
MALE SPEAKER: I have to say
I'm quite impressed to see

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.240
how many people are using
Android Studio already.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.530
So that has to do with
the fact that it's

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:48.730
built on this rock-solid
base with IntelliJ.

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:49.771
TOR NORBYE: That's right.

00:08:49.771 --> 00:08:52.490
I mean, let's not forget, even
though it's a 1.0 product,

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:56.120
it is built on
IntelliJ version 13.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.290
It's a very, very solid IDE.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:58.789
So I think the parts
that we've done

00:08:58.789 --> 00:09:00.700
that have sort of
been tricky for us

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.324
is taking an external
build system, Gradle,

00:09:03.324 --> 00:09:05.490
and making that work as the
build system in the IDE.

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:07.857
IDEs tend to be-- I
don't say control freaks,

00:09:07.857 --> 00:09:09.190
but that's kind of how they are.

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:10.580
Like, the IDE knows everything.

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:11.750
It knows how to
build everything.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:12.660
It knows what changed.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:13.370
MALE SPEAKER: That's the deal.

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:14.540
TOR NORBYE: That
is what IDEs do.

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:16.331
We have deliberately
chosen not to do that,

00:09:16.331 --> 00:09:19.390
to not have one implementation
of the build system in Studio,

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:20.090
and another on the command line.

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:21.840
We're saying, we're
always running Gradle.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.548
And so we're working
a lot on performance

00:09:23.548 --> 00:09:26.180
in Gradle to make-- we're not
quite where we want to be at.

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:27.480
I will be totally
honest about that.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.105
MALE SPEAKER: Well,
it's a 1.0 version.

00:09:29.105 --> 00:09:31.965
Performance is never really the
biggest focus of a 1.0 version.

00:09:31.965 --> 00:09:33.090
So maybe that's something--

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:33.230
TOR NORBYE: That's right.

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:34.500
And a lot of
editing features are

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.830
happening with that compilation.

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:37.330
So if you were used
to using Eclipse

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:40.545
or used to that-- it doesn't
update the quick fixes until we

00:09:40.545 --> 00:09:43.410
press Save, because that's
when it runs its compilation.

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:44.930
IntelliJ does not work that way.

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:47.710
It is constantly-- the
minute you pause editing,

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:50.230
it'll actually go
and do its checking

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:52.450
and highlight errors for you.

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:54.200
Building is actually
when you want to run.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:54.830
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:55.539
TOR NORBYE: Yeah.

00:09:55.539 --> 00:09:56.371
MALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:09:56.371 --> 00:09:57.680
So 1.0 is around the corner.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.510
Maybe by the time people
see this, it will be out.

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:02.830
So go out and
check for yourself.

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:05.230
TOR NORBYE: Depends
on how soon this is.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.702
But definitely we're
hoping very, very soon.

00:10:07.702 --> 00:10:08.410
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:10.774
Well, Tor, thanks a lot
for spending the time.

00:10:10.774 --> 00:10:11.690
TOR NORBYE: Thank you.

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:13.900
MALE SPEAKER: People, try
it out and send feedback.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:14.566
TOR NORBYE: Yes.

00:10:14.566 --> 00:10:15.411
Report bugs, please.

00:10:15.411 --> 00:10:16.410
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:17.960
Bye.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:35.157
