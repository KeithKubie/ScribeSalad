00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
So now that we've learned, a bunch of new words

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.796
related with classes and objects, we will move on to

00:00:05.796 --> 00:00:09.072
creating a movie website. And here is the final output

00:00:09.072 --> 00:00:11.808
that we are after. All of our favorite movies, on a

00:00:11.808 --> 00:00:14.595
web page. And as you have seen previously, if you

00:00:14.595 --> 00:00:17.640
click on anyone of these movies, we see its trailer.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.030
Let's build this. So here I am, back with my

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.970
code. Now thus far, we've made only two movie objects. Toy

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.610
Story and Avatar. I'm going to make a few more.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.600
In fact, four more movie objects. But before I do

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.940
that, I want to make this window, a little bit

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.320
bigger, so we can see all of this code really easily.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.620
Okay. So here are the two instances we have created

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.740
thus far. Toy Story and Avatar. Now before I proceed, I

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.780
will go ahead and comment ou the previous output statements

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.260
that I created. This print statement and the show trailer method.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.087
So let me just add a comment there,

00:00:52.087 --> 00:00:56.070
and there. Done. Now, I'm going to add

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.860
a new movie object, for a movie called, School

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.400
of Rock. There it is. You will notice, that

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.239
I have changed the name of the movie,

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.750
its story-line, its poster image, and its future trailer

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.720
values appropriately. Next, I will add another movie object.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.900
This time, for an animated movie called Ratatouille. Next,

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.420
I will add a movie object called, Midnight in

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.850
Paris. Now this, happens to be one of my

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.100
favorite movies. And the final movie object I will

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.560
add, is for a movie called, the Hunger Games.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.650
Okay, so thus far, we have created six movie

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.020
objects. So far, so good. Now, to turn this

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.340
into a movie website. You will need a piece

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.590
of code that weed out. Now we call this code,

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.970
fresh_tomatoes.py. By the way, this file is available

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.110
for you to download in the instructor notes. Now

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.950
before we use it, let's see what this

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.823
file actually does. This file, fresh_tomatoes.py, has a function

00:01:51.823 --> 00:01:55.600
inside it called, open_movies_page. Let's look at this

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.650
function a bit more closely. Now, what this function

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.360
does, is that it takes in, a list of

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.190
movies as input, and as output it creates and

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.300
opens an HTML page or a website, that shows

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.030
the movies you gave it in the first place.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.140
So what I'm going to do next, is use

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.610
this file, fresh_tomatoes.py, and it's

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.390
function, open_movies_page, inside our code.
