1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,373
Okay.

2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:02,810
Hey, what's going on?

3
00:00:02,811 --> 00:00:06,780
It's Bill Burr and It's time for the
Monday morning podcast from my one day

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,150
Monday, May 29th,

5
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:15,470
2017 what's going on out? You
[inaudible] how are you guys doing?

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,380
Happy Memorial Day.

7
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,950
Happy Memorial Day when you're
supposed to be out there.

8
00:00:24,051 --> 00:00:26,330
Remember the troops you're
going to be getting [inaudible]

9
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,010
the hammer [inaudible]

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,260
say bad shit to your wife that you laid
up to apologize for what's going on.

11
00:00:33,261 --> 00:00:37,970
You fucking soon to be fat
fucks. Huh? You got the,

12
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:38,990
you got the grill going?

13
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,400
[inaudible]

14
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,760
hey Matt, about up right?
We got a little killed.

15
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,510
Bosh. What are you guys making today? Huh?

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,110
What fucking animal had to
get the old right there, Fred?

17
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:56,010
You know in an upper cut to another
one. You fucking sewed them together.

18
00:00:56,011 --> 00:00:59,610
What God's name do you have on your grill
right now that you know you fucking,

19
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,130
what'd you put in there?
A bunch of cheese.

20
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:08,310
Who wants cheese on their burger on
and he sees a good fucking burn, right?

21
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,510
Um, oh. You know it's the best. So you
put the buns on. That's, that's the,

22
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,040
you know, you keep checking and keep
checking me. Looking at the meat.

23
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,900
Don't want to burn the bunt.
Uh, Christ they burn this one

24
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,630
with burns. Ah, I bet she
swallows up. Sorry. Sorry.

25
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,910
Why Bill? Why, why did you have to
take the Nice family day that this is,

26
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,500
you know, that the great
men of this country fought.

27
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:41,010
So you could go out there, you
know, work slowly, work your way,

28
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,850
take another step towards
a fucking massive coronary.

29
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,670
How many people are going to
face plant into their grill today

30
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,070
via too much alcohol?

31
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,790
Well, you know,

32
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,810
just eating that last thing that fucking
makes the ticker stop or you know,

33
00:02:01,811 --> 00:02:06,220
the classic old fucking middle-aged man,

34
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:11,560
uh, injury, the fucking blown
out Achilles, you know. Oh,

35
00:02:11,561 --> 00:02:14,710
did you say you want to pickles and you
just turn a little too fast and pallet

36
00:02:14,711 --> 00:02:16,390
shit goes right up the back of your leg.

37
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:22,060
Then you face plant right to your fucking
grill. Full side of the face. Right.

38
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,400
You'd be surprised. I bet if I
could somehow get some sort of live,

39
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,620
you know, folders in here.

40
00:02:29,621 --> 00:02:33,370
I bet my phone lines would be
lighting up right now with paramedics,

41
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:36,970
fire department people,
people that drive ambulances.

42
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,670
Hey is the driver the ambulance,

43
00:02:39,671 --> 00:02:42,490
do you actually have to know how to
help people or you just like the guy,

44
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,500
the getaway driver, you know,

45
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:47,950
all you need to do is know how
to turn on the siren, you know,

46
00:02:47,951 --> 00:02:49,150
be able to block it out.

47
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,920
Do you think ambulance drivers hear that
Siren at night as they lay there quiet

48
00:02:53,921 --> 00:02:56,680
bedroom, you know, probably to put
fucking music on cause they don't,

49
00:02:56,681 --> 00:02:57,730
they just laying there and all ears.

50
00:02:58,930 --> 00:02:59,763
Woo.

51
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:05,860
Slowly going insane. Um, I dunno,

52
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,640
I'm in a great fucking mood. You know,

53
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:14,200
my lovely little lay is starting
to sleep through the night.

54
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:17,560
I'm starting to get some sleep
again. Dude, she's hilarious.

55
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,620
She just does this thing now she's
trying out a voice. You just guys got

56
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:24,283
[inaudible]

57
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:29,040
loudest shit laying in the bed in the
morning between me and the [inaudible].

58
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:34,920
It's like fucking a little mini
Jerry Lewis the entire time.

59
00:03:34,921 --> 00:03:38,820
It's so I just put my hand
over her mouth and I just,

60
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:41,070
I just make it go like a
little out loud I think.

61
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,350
And then she kind of like looks
around like, what the fuck was that?

62
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,490
And that stops her for about four
seconds before she starts again.

63
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:51,690
And then she gets used to the
noise and then that's it. Um,

64
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,810
she starting to crawl. She's fucking
moving backwards. It's funny, like they,

65
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,430
I guess they moved backwards first.
So it's like the thing that they want,

66
00:03:59,431 --> 00:04:02,850
it just keeps getting further
and further away like that.

67
00:04:02,851 --> 00:04:07,680
A Alfred Hitchcock shot.
Um, but, uh, anyways,

68
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:11,160
I had family for Banky.
She out here this weekend,

69
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,630
which means plenty of booze,
plenty of fucking crazy foods.

70
00:04:14,631 --> 00:04:18,750
So I've been doing the elliptical
every day doing what I can.

71
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,010
But uh, you know, this
is like, at this point,

72
00:04:23,011 --> 00:04:26,580
everybody's going to come out here, has
come out here. They've all seen her.

73
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:31,110
They all love her. And what's
awesome is now I don't have to, uh,

74
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,980
I realize now when people visit
me, they're not coming to see me,

75
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,730
which is fucking awesome. That
coming to see her. Oh, hey bill,

76
00:04:38,731 --> 00:04:40,860
how are you doing? Where is
she? Where is she? She over.

77
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,110
We all would you look at
her, look at her. It's great.

78
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,450
And you just peel off
in the back, you know,

79
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,110
all your family members come over and
then they all get to hold her and stuff,

80
00:04:49,111 --> 00:04:51,570
you know? So then you get to sit
there. Boozing in the corner.

81
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,050
Yeah,

82
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,850
the holidays now. It's
been great. She's awesome.

83
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,890
Um, she's so awesome. I'm not getting
any fucking material out of it.

84
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,880
Everyone was telling me, Oh
my God, you haven't a kid.

85
00:05:08,881 --> 00:05:11,460
I can't wait for you to
become a dad. Oh my God.

86
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,360
I want to see how your rack changes.
It hasn't. I'm still paranoid.

87
00:05:15,361 --> 00:05:18,270
I'm still filthy and I'm,
my daughter's awesome.

88
00:05:18,271 --> 00:05:21,270
So you know, that's not funny.

89
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:27,540
Hey Bro, it's like being a
dad. It's Gregg phenomenal.

90
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,930
I think most of my materials, just
about other fucking lunatic parents.

91
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,040
I'm telling you what I'm going to start
saying to people when they go, oh,

92
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,670
she's, Oh yeah, that's a great age.
I'll wait. Wait til three days from now,

93
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,950
then all well, you've
gone, she's going talk.

94
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,460
She'll fucking start stabbing
you in the night. I'm,

95
00:05:44,461 --> 00:05:47,460
you want me to start saying those parents?
I'm just going to be like, you know,

96
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,260
you sound like a horrible father and
I think you married the wrong person.

97
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:53,280
Have a nice day.

98
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:02,660
Oh, you could look at this experience
in a negative way is fucking. Look,

99
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:03,740
if you're broke,

100
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:08,160
if you're a kid, if you're a fucking
high school student, right? And you know,

101
00:06:08,161 --> 00:06:13,161
you started bagging your God Damn English
teacher [inaudible] you didn't know

102
00:06:13,531 --> 00:06:18,050
enough to pull out as much as
they told you in sex education,

103
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,690
how much you know how a baby's made.

104
00:06:20,691 --> 00:06:24,380
You couldn't fucking believe you are
banging your English teacher and the next

105
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:28,100
thing you know you're going to be a fun
yet then. Then it's brutal. You know,

106
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,570
you're married to this fucking old broad,

107
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,460
it's always correcting
your fucking sentences.

108
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:33,803
You know,

109
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,800
you're calling around for dressing like
a horror and she's fucking giving you

110
00:06:37,801 --> 00:06:41,220
shit for a, for a dangling
participle, whatever the fuck.

111
00:06:41,221 --> 00:06:44,040
I never knew what that meant.
The past part of supple

112
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,660
bill was a past participle.
This sentence, I don't know,

113
00:06:48,661 --> 00:06:49,920
just send me to summer school,

114
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:54,300
just gimme gimme in that fucking
distilled version of this class.

115
00:06:54,301 --> 00:06:59,040
That is nothing. That Dream Team of
class clowns that is summer school,

116
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,330
drug addicts and musicians. It was
just fucking tremendous summer school.

117
00:07:03,331 --> 00:07:07,500
Underrated. I tell you,
I went, I did it twice.

118
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,540
I should've done it all four
years of high school, but a,

119
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,940
I blew off the last year cause
what was the fucking point?

120
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:16,530
My Sophomore Year my teacher
hooked me up, gave me the d minus,

121
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:21,660
um, d minus in geometry. Um,

122
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,480
I fucking had a great time. I had a
great time. I had to take one class.

123
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,820
You don't get me out
of bed in the morning.

124
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,960
In summer school was combined like three
towns where I lived and it was, uh,

125
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:39,540
it was all the class clowns. Just
like I said, creative people,

126
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:43,020
everybody had add in the level of
shit that they gave to the teacher.

127
00:07:43,021 --> 00:07:46,890
I was like, wow, I got to up my game.
These people are on a whole nother level.

128
00:07:46,891 --> 00:07:49,530
It's like when you go to jail,
you become like a better criminal.

129
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,550
I became a better class clown
just sitting there like, wow,

130
00:07:53,551 --> 00:07:54,690
these guys are fucking,

131
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,040
these guys have no intention
of going to college.

132
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,920
I'm at least still lying to myself.
Yeah, I think I could, you know,

133
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,070
I think I could go in the later rounds

134
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,960
if you were a fucking draft
pick, be honest with yourself.

135
00:08:09,961 --> 00:08:13,680
You're a high school student, what
round are you going in? You know,

136
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,650
and if you really think about
it, that's why Bill Belichick,

137
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,310
he doesn't like the first round draft
picks because the first round draft picks,

138
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:23,790
they like booksmart. Right. They're
the fucking nerds. You know,

139
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:24,900
you give them some information,

140
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:27,900
they'll memorize it and they'll
spit it right back at Ya. Right.

141
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:32,180
There's no passion. They, they, they,

142
00:08:32,181 --> 00:08:34,190
they don't walk into a
room and light it up.

143
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:38,750
This is a bad analogy cause first
round draft picks do I guess, do they,

144
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:43,790
I don't know about college basketball
now with everybody one and done.

145
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:48,040
You'd bring this fucking kid
to a locker room full of men.

146
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,550
You can put the team on his
back, bony fucking legs.

147
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:56,840
Um, we'll bill, are they supposed
to do a lot of them? You know,

148
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:01,010
it's like their, their mothers, uh, you
know, they, they need a new kidney and,

149
00:09:01,011 --> 00:09:04,220
and uh, the, the shack they live in
is falling up. Okay, fair enough.

150
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:08,870
Fair enough. Yeah. But
selfishly is a fan. You know,

151
00:09:08,871 --> 00:09:13,130
you miss the days when somebody had
four years with fucking coach k or Dean

152
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:16,520
Smith, rest his soul, Bobby
Knight, flipping them in the chin.

153
00:09:16,521 --> 00:09:18,500
Stop looking down on the
ground and fucking man,

154
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,180
that'd be, I've told them, but
we've got to be tell you much.

155
00:09:23,181 --> 00:09:26,870
I fucking loved that Bobby Knight
speech where he says, you know,

156
00:09:26,871 --> 00:09:30,150
I'm not going to, you're not gonna. I'm
not gonna walk around with a 14 to 20.

157
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,913
Okay.

158
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,250
I don't know what it is about.

159
00:09:36,251 --> 00:09:38,810
That guy listened to that speech
and it makes me want to go fucking,

160
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,760
I don't know. I'll go to the gym.
I have to listen to that guy.

161
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:47,980
Something happened, you know, when
that guy got ran out of town, that was,

162
00:09:47,981 --> 00:09:50,260
that was it, you know.
Then all of a sudden like,

163
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:52,290
okay

164
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,750
guys steered into just
literally being pussies,

165
00:09:54,751 --> 00:09:57,660
like fucking wearing shirts with
cats on them and stuff. Yeah.

166
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,133
You know,

167
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:04,890
my wife was showing me that like there's
a men's onesy that's out there now.

168
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,440
The guys aware and I was like,
you gotta be fucking Kitty.

169
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:10,980
Like what is it going to stop? When is
it going to steer back to testosterone?

170
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:15,120
When is the guy's guy going
to make a comeback? I mean,

171
00:10:15,121 --> 00:10:19,920
everything makes a comeback,
right? Classic Rock Disco Hair,

172
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:23,160
metals. Make it a little bit of a
comeback. I don't fucking, I, you know,

173
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,231
I just don't get it.

174
00:10:25,231 --> 00:10:30,231
So then somebody show me what they've
like pulled Sean Connery wall one in one

175
00:10:30,511 --> 00:10:34,050
of the James Bond movies
and it's like, all right,

176
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:36,810
but he wasn't wearing it like
he thought it looked good.

177
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,530
He wasn't wearing it cause
it was fucking stupid.

178
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:42,883
Okay.

179
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:46,510
You know, that's what
I can't fucking stand.

180
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,900
Everything's like mocking something
else. It's like, all right,

181
00:10:49,901 --> 00:10:54,520
so what do you believe in? What are
you going to fucking sign your name to?

182
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:58,390
And these fucking millennial cons.
The deal. I can't say all of them.

183
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,340
That's not fair to whole generation,

184
00:11:00,341 --> 00:11:04,600
but so the ones that at least
they're taking pictures of. Okay.

185
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,530
Which granted most of these
pictures of being taken care of,

186
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:12,280
taken by older people from my generation
who are jealous of younger people.

187
00:11:12,281 --> 00:11:13,540
That's what a lot of it is. I bet.

188
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:17,200
I Bet I'm overreacting when
I really think about it.

189
00:11:17,201 --> 00:11:21,220
I don't really see a lot of
people with cats on their shirts.

190
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,290
Although when they do,
people take pictures of them,

191
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:27,130
then they post them on social media and
then old fucks like me start going, oh,

192
00:11:27,131 --> 00:11:31,570
look at these fucking millennials.
Barely fucking, um, all right,

193
00:11:31,571 --> 00:11:34,240
so scratch all of that.
I mean really built up.

194
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,380
Have you seen anybody with the onesy?

195
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,340
Somebody just showed you
a picture and then you,

196
00:11:38,341 --> 00:11:39,970
you literally started freaking out.

197
00:11:39,971 --> 00:11:43,600
Like you watch CNN or
Fox News for two hours.

198
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:47,680
It's always a great thing to do.
Watch those for a couple, two,

199
00:11:47,681 --> 00:11:49,450
three hours and they get y'all panicked.

200
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:52,690
What you want to do is you want to
switch between the two of them, right?

201
00:11:52,691 --> 00:11:56,710
And then you out the lies and you
keep yourself levelheaded, you know,

202
00:11:56,711 --> 00:11:58,540
fake news. Tell fake news.

203
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:00,983
Um,

204
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,980
so anyways, I don't want to be like
that. I want to be that guy. Okay.

205
00:12:03,981 --> 00:12:05,510
God bless you millennials. I'm sure this,

206
00:12:05,511 --> 00:12:07,460
there's plenty of guys guys on the way.

207
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,370
You're out there fucking
crushing ass and God bless you.

208
00:12:10,371 --> 00:12:12,940
Enjoy your youth joy,

209
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:17,140
you fucking youth before it's memorial
day and suddenly you're that guy with the

210
00:12:17,141 --> 00:12:21,370
dad bod standing in front of the grill,
filling that tightness in your Achilles.

211
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,433
You know,

212
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:27,010
you got to reach for that last burger
on the back of the fucking Griffith.

213
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:30,490
You just start feeling that tightness
in your ankle and you're like, God,

214
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,680
if it's going to happen, please
don't let it happen. Now,

215
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,720
not in front of my
family. Becky sched. Um,

216
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,850
nobody is guests the movie by
the way, that I am referring to.

217
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:46,410
We had problems with the family baggy east

218
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,090
a this, I was going to
say, I'd give you a hint,

219
00:12:51,091 --> 00:12:53,700
but this isn't really a hint
in my opinion, that movie,

220
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:58,920
it's a car movie for me.

221
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,990
I just feel like that movies, a car movie.

222
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,230
Other people thought there was
some philosophical question.

223
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,283
Okay.

224
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,020
You know who's the fly?
Who's the windshield?

225
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:17,170
All I remember from that movie was I
loved the car cause I love the fucking

226
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,353
sleep.

227
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:20,800
Okay.

228
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,400
I remember the car that was a sleeper
and then I just remembered that there was

229
00:13:24,401 --> 00:13:28,860
this one guy was Evan Bravo,
lived with the family Baggie East.

230
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:32,650
And that explained his
entire fucking backstory.

231
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:38,260
That's now if you guys can't guess
it now. I don't know what the fuck.

232
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,570
I don't know. I don't know
what to tell you. All right.

233
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:43,410
They had a fucking pizza. Wow.

234
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,740
Yeah. Can I get a, can I get
a sausage in a rubella? Eh,

235
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:53,620
we got no Rugola no, you don't have
any Rugola. Yeah, we had family.

236
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,480
We out with the family. Becky
still will give us a rubella.

237
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:03,140
Um, anyway, so what'd you guys do
this weekend? Other ones sit around.

238
00:14:03,141 --> 00:14:05,240
You know what I did? I watched, um,

239
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:09,370
somebody tweeted me on the
old Twitter and told me,

240
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:12,710
you're watching the time trials for
Monaco and here's the thing. I, you know,

241
00:14:12,711 --> 00:14:13,670
I'm new to F1.

242
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:18,200
She guys know I can barely
remember the fucking names.

243
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:21,563
Um,

244
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,190
so I'm like, I'm going to, I didn't,

245
00:14:23,191 --> 00:14:27,660
I had no idea like how they qualify
for a race. I just thought you'd,

246
00:14:27,661 --> 00:14:30,680
you know, you get like
five laps around the track.

247
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:35,090
Whoever has the best time gets the pole
position and then they just work their

248
00:14:35,091 --> 00:14:37,550
way back. But that, that,
that is not how it works.

249
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,400
It's like a whole other day of
racing. Cause I always wonder why,

250
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:45,350
why the fuck did people show up
to watch these, these qualifying?

251
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,280
Okay.

252
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:51,080
I mean, just watch some guy
by himself out to he, yeah.

253
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:57,410
Eh, he's gotta be at
Eighth Place Tomorrow. Um,

254
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,520
that's not how it works.

255
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,180
It is the race before the race
and it's like this three race.

256
00:15:02,181 --> 00:15:05,030
So there's three levels of the
qualifying. This is like, first of all,

257
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:09,380
there's practice laps to get you used
to the track and if you don't do the

258
00:15:09,381 --> 00:15:11,810
practice laps, you're not allowed to race.

259
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:13,700
So obviously there's probably
some safety thing. Like, dude,

260
00:15:13,701 --> 00:15:16,700
you're not just gonna fucking go out
there and start driving 200 miles an hour.

261
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:22,250
It's this next one, a right
or a left turn share. Um,

262
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,360
qualifying. Okay. So there's
this like three rounds of it.

263
00:15:26,361 --> 00:15:31,080
So qualifying the first round one, it's
like match madness, but with, cause,

264
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:37,100
um, it lasts for 18 minutes.
Everybody gets on the fucking track.

265
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,160
I'm sure they, I don't know,
they let six out and another six.

266
00:15:40,161 --> 00:15:42,110
I don't know how the fuck they do
it. I missed that part of it. Okay.

267
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:47,500
But it lasts for 18 minutes at the end
of which time can you tell I'm reading

268
00:15:47,601 --> 00:15:48,170
this,

269
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:53,170
the six slowest drivers are eliminated
from qualifying and 16 advance to QT,

270
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,030
the qualifying two. So those six are
going to be, and I thought, oh my God,

271
00:15:59,031 --> 00:16:03,410
are they out of the fucking race? Is
this like golf or you miss the cut?

272
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:08,090
And I found out later. No, they
just start way in the back.

273
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,460
Okay. So,

274
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:13,123
um,

275
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:16,260
so there's 22 fucking drivers.
I guess. So. Let's see.

276
00:16:16,261 --> 00:16:19,800
So six of them are fucking
eliminated. They're not,

277
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:22,710
they're usually 20 drivers
to, to not kept to go home.

278
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,950
I have no idea if anybody
knows the information to that.

279
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:28,350
I don't know if anybody, if you don't
move to the next round of qualifying,

280
00:16:28,351 --> 00:16:31,590
if anybody actually
doesn't get to race. Um,

281
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:35,010
cause I thought there was 20 cars in the
race and according to this mass there's

282
00:16:35,011 --> 00:16:39,060
22 but whatever. So six are eliminated
in the first one, then the next 16,

283
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:39,901
you know,

284
00:16:39,901 --> 00:16:44,901
after a short break the times are reset
and the 16 remaining cars run in a 15

285
00:16:45,691 --> 00:16:48,270
minute session. It's
an hour down to 15. Uh,

286
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:52,350
and at the end of which the slowest six
cars are eliminated from qualifying,

287
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:56,880
leaving 10 to progress
to qualifying three.

288
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:01,040
Now the top 10 spots
after the race, those,

289
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:05,430
that's when you're in the points
from first all the way to 10th.

290
00:17:05,431 --> 00:17:09,990
It's like something like 25
points for first 18 for second,

291
00:17:09,991 --> 00:17:13,440
then it's like 15, then
12, 10, eight, six, four,

292
00:17:13,441 --> 00:17:18,390
two one are the points.
Huh? You're in the,

293
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,640
you're in the fucking
lightning round at that point.

294
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:22,783
Um,

295
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,420
and then the, and whoever, yeah.

296
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:29,150
Obviously it has the best
run after that gets the, uh,

297
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,430
qualifying three after a further break,

298
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,480
times a reset and the final 12 minutes
session is held the decide pole position

299
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,180
in the standing order of
the top 10 grid places.

300
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:40,970
That's when you're in
the points. All right?

301
00:17:40,971 --> 00:17:43,990
That's when you're going home with
least with a fucking year supply or

302
00:17:43,991 --> 00:17:46,790
Rice-a-roni if you're in the top 10. So

303
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,730
I watched can somebody on Twitter
is like, dude, you gotta watch this.

304
00:17:50,731 --> 00:17:53,700
This might be better
than the race. So, uh,

305
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:57,330
Lewis Hamilton from the ILM man,

306
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,790
it's an island with men,

307
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,480
nothing but men all walking around
like right way or the fucking A's,

308
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:11,660
the birds, whatever the fuck they
call them over there. Slags um,

309
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:18,960
anyways, he's out there,
he's got Mercedes,

310
00:18:18,961 --> 00:18:21,180
he's got one of the fastest
fucking cars out there,

311
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,920
but for whatever fucking reason,

312
00:18:22,921 --> 00:18:25,650
he's not getting enough downward force
or something on the front of his car.

313
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:28,590
And the front end is
sliding all over everywhere.

314
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:34,150
So he barely gets out of qualifying one.
He gets into qualifying too and it's,

315
00:18:34,151 --> 00:18:39,151
there's a 15 minutes session and he's
outside of to qualifying to get to the

316
00:18:39,241 --> 00:18:44,190
next level. His time is too slow,
so he's got time to do one more run.

317
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:49,500
Okay. Now he's in second
place overall for the, um,

318
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,250
for the uh, to become champ.

319
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,130
Just stay in to stay on
pace to be whatever the,

320
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,900
the fucking best drive of
the year. I'm sorry guys,

321
00:18:57,901 --> 00:19:00,330
I'm new to this fucking thing. Um,

322
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:04,170
and his fucking front end starts sliding
all over the place and then some con

323
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,200
hits the wall so then the yellow flag
comes out and I guess that doesn't matter

324
00:19:09,321 --> 00:19:12,320
if some asshole drives
into the fucking wall,

325
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,710
you're qualifying time is done.
This fucking idiot. Right?

326
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:17,300
Okay.

327
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:21,890
He's a professional driver. He hits the
wall. How did he hit the wall? I get it.

328
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:25,920
You caught enough. They said they
actually put some special steering,

329
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:29,120
they made custom steering just for that
fucking track and Monaco cause it just

330
00:19:29,121 --> 00:19:31,640
driving through the streets and they have
such a hairpin turn that they actually

331
00:19:31,641 --> 00:19:35,090
have to turn the wheel harder than
they do any other race. You know,

332
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:39,420
why would they just leave that in?
Did you want to have that option?

333
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,730
Okay. She had a drive a little all the
way around something at some point.

334
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:47,250
And the other races,
evidently not. Um, so anyways,

335
00:19:47,251 --> 00:19:47,911
long story short,

336
00:19:47,911 --> 00:19:52,590
this fucking guy I think from force
India with the few Checar just basically,

337
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:54,390
you know, he pulls the Greg Bay Brady,

338
00:19:54,391 --> 00:19:57,060
you know gotta beat Marsha getting a
cold closer then a quarter of an inch.

339
00:19:57,061 --> 00:19:59,910
He fucking slams right into
the wall and then that's it.

340
00:19:59,911 --> 00:20:04,230
And Louis Hamilton was so
fucking dejected, he couldn't
even get out of his car,

341
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,180
you know. And a long story short,

342
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,100
the fucking Ferrari's.

343
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:14,790
What a fuck does my God damn
computer keep doing this to me.

344
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:17,640
Okay.

345
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,560
You want to get the screen
to come up? Can you stay up?

346
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:23,500
Do I got to sit there finger in the
fucking thing the whole time? Um,

347
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,510
yeah. So long story
short, the Ferrari's one,

348
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,630
the first and second
position and I think, uh,

349
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,310
that Butaro sky,

350
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:37,340
the finish dude started in third and
Lewis Hamilton was all the way back in

351
00:20:37,591 --> 00:20:41,510
14th. So he's out of the points and a,

352
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,450
you're driving through the fucking
streets of Monaco, a sovereign state.

353
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,760
In other words, they're in France, but
they're not part of France. Like, yeah,

354
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:52,720
fuck off. We're doing
our own thing here. And

355
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:57,640
I guess it's really hard to
pass there. But despite that,

356
00:20:57,641 --> 00:21:02,641
the fucking race starts and immediately
he went from 14th to 12th and I'm

357
00:21:02,921 --> 00:21:04,840
watching the race and I'm
like, this motherfucker,

358
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,730
he's probably going to finish fourth.

359
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:10,820
He's somehow gonna figure somebody
is gonna fuck up in their pit stop.

360
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,110
Something's going to happen.

361
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:14,840
So I'm whining the whole time I'm watching
the race and I'm watching and he's

362
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:16,010
12th and he's 11th,

363
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,970
then he's 10th and the fucking announces
of blowing it off because they're too

364
00:21:19,971 --> 00:21:22,430
busy looking at the, what the
Ferrari's are going to do,

365
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,560
what the red bold team's doing,

366
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:28,940
what the fuck a Bhutanese is going to
be doing in the Mercedes. It meanwhile,

367
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,530
is Lewis Hamilton just moving it?

368
00:21:30,531 --> 00:21:32,210
This is the longest I've
ever talked about race and I,

369
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,550
they've got a film people like,
dude, I don't give a fuck.

370
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,650
Yo get driving around in a circle.

371
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:42,700
Um, no they're not. Then I try run
those left and right turns. All right.

372
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,710
Does a chicane

373
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,610
dude, you at least gotta Watch Monaco.

374
00:21:49,611 --> 00:21:51,590
You should've watched Monica
with the fucking Illuminati.

375
00:21:51,591 --> 00:21:53,300
People fucking back their yachts up.

376
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:55,880
Although I went online and I
find like you can actually,

377
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:57,590
there's a lot of them
are just like packages.

378
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,100
Like those aren't just rich people
with their yachts backed up.

379
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:05,120
It's just a lot of like booze cruises
and you can sit there on a fucking yacht

380
00:22:05,121 --> 00:22:09,110
getting hammered, acting like you didn't
just light up your fucking credit card.

381
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:14,650
Whenever Stacy will deal with it.
When we get back, we get baggy aged.

382
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,670
So long story shorts, uh,

383
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,740
on a track that you could
not fucking pass on somehow.

384
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:25,770
Lewis past seven fucking people finish
seventh. So let's see, that's a one, two,

385
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:29,140
he got like six points or
something like that. And a,

386
00:22:29,141 --> 00:22:33,640
the Ferrari's came in first
and second. All right. Uh,

387
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:37,660
Sebastian Vettel ended up winning
after a great fucking pit stop.

388
00:22:37,661 --> 00:22:41,710
And what's his face? A Kimmy
riken in his, at his fucking name

389
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,290
raking in or whatever. Finish dude.
Sebastian's the Kraut, the German dude,

390
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:49,580
he fucking comes out of the pit
before him. Then he hit Kimmy

391
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:51,340
going like, God, what the fuck?

392
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,300
He sounded like Mick with
somebody cut me off for traffic.

393
00:22:55,301 --> 00:23:00,190
But he's driving like 170 miles
an hour. Uh, and what's his face?

394
00:23:00,191 --> 00:23:03,160
Daniel? Always a bridesmaid.
Never a fucking winner.

395
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:06,070
Ricardo came in fucking third.
The guy's always on the podium.

396
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,540
Never comes in first.

397
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:12,140
He's gotta be pissed. Like
guys, what the fuck can you

398
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,660
do some, do the car here so I can get
past these Ferrari's and Mercedes and man,

399
00:23:15,661 --> 00:23:16,900
what a whoa. And I gotta do here.

400
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:22,380
Um, so long story short, Ferrari
as a team, as 196 points,

401
00:23:22,381 --> 00:23:26,790
Mercedes has 179 and the Americans,
the Yanks, just to let you know,

402
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:31,500
we're pulling up the rear, we've got
our first points of the season. Uh,

403
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,920
what do we got? We got Romaine
like the lettuce, Grosse Gene,

404
00:23:34,921 --> 00:23:39,210
he got nine points and then Kevin
Magnuson, like the condoms got five.

405
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:43,770
So we got 14 points. So I'll just
for those Ferrari's and Mercedes,

406
00:23:43,771 --> 00:23:46,010
better mind that fucking
p's q's. Cause the yanks are

407
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,430
coming. All right. Thank you for fucking
sitting through all of that shit. Um,

408
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,820
let's talk about tiger woods.

409
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,120
Jesus fucking Christ.

410
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,410
Can you believe he got arrested
for drinking and driving?

411
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,620
It only happens to nine zillion
people every fucking day.

412
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,050
I'm so sick of people
talking about tiger woods,

413
00:24:06,051 --> 00:24:10,520
like the way they disrespect
this guy. You know,

414
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,050
I love Stephen A. Smith,

415
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:16,280
but I started watching him talking
and he was saying that, you know,

416
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:18,210
that, you know,

417
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:23,210
this guy is just his fall from
basically his fall from grace and um,

418
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:27,060
and how his whole, you know,

419
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:30,660
he became a billionaire and his whole
fucking thing was based on the fact that

420
00:24:30,661 --> 00:24:33,420
he presented himself as a family
man. And I'm thinking like,

421
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:34,800
what the fuck did that guy,

422
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:37,500
when the fuck did he ever
present himself as a family man,

423
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:44,710
I didn't get to where the fuck he was
because he was the best golfer anybody had

424
00:24:44,711 --> 00:24:45,544
ever seen

425
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,200
because he was making like
PGA fucking links look like,

426
00:24:51,201 --> 00:24:55,060
like he was playing
miniature golf. I know.

427
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,980
Pay attention to that fucking blondie
was why I don't even know her fucking

428
00:24:57,981 --> 00:24:58,814
name.

429
00:24:58,970 --> 00:24:59,803
Yeah.

430
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:03,990
And then [inaudible] he begs a bunch
of Hooters whores and then I'm spot.

431
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:08,510
Then I'm supposed to sit on the
couch going, you lie to me, tiger.

432
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,970
I thought after your golf,

433
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:15,980
you fucking went down to Applebee's
with your family and fucking your family

434
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,810
baggies and you shared a fucking bloomin'
onion. I have to be honest with you,

435
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:26,080
I never once thought about what the fuck
that guy did when he got off the golf

436
00:25:27,141 --> 00:25:30,830
course and when I found out what
he was doing off the golf course.

437
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:34,760
I was like, yeah, I mean,
that kind of makes sense.

438
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:36,940
Yeah.

439
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:40,210
I am just going to say the steam out
of fucking men. Okay. When Steven A.

440
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:44,150
Smith walks out of his studio, you know,

441
00:25:44,151 --> 00:25:48,500
he doesn't have a line of whores
just waiting to fucking blow them,

442
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,770
just so they could say,
I blew Steven A. Smith.

443
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:56,030
Tiger Woods had to deal with
that. And like most men,

444
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,460
he folded under the pressure

445
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:05,780
and the fucking reason why
he's not doing well right now,

446
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,550
it's not because of his fucking wife.
Who by the way took a bunch of his money,

447
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:15,980
bought a house, fucking knocked it
down and then rebuilt another one. Huh?

448
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:16,910
What about her?

449
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:20,520
I thought she wasn't
environmentalist. She liked to be

450
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:26,240
right. What about her? What
about all blondie? Right there?

451
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,290
I still a bit about this.

452
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:32,270
Do you think she would even give tiger
woods a second fucking glance if he

453
00:26:32,271 --> 00:26:36,560
wasn't making all that money? If he
wasn't the greatest at what he did.

454
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:40,610
What? All blonde, blue eyed. Even
give that guy a fucking second.

455
00:26:40,611 --> 00:26:43,980
I don't think she would've. All right.

456
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:47,190
Even when you're a bum like me,

457
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:52,191
when you fucking walked into the singles
bar back in the 90s what did women or

458
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:56,520
we say, what do you do?
They're not making small talk.

459
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:02,340
Okay. Women all fucking judge. Okay.

460
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,290
Their status and then they get a
number in their head. All right.

461
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:11,580
And then they find out
the jobs, okay, debt,

462
00:27:11,581 --> 00:27:15,600
earn this and earn that. And then they
figured like who they can fuck. Okay.

463
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:18,480
And then it becomes a thing of like, okay,

464
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:23,670
you're underneath what I want for the
lifestyle that I'm looking for in the

465
00:27:23,671 --> 00:27:28,230
future. But you're a good looking enough
guy that I'll fucking bang it tonight.

466
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,090
Maybe I'll have a little fling with you,

467
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,830
but that's getting the
end of the fucking day.

468
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:36,330
You know when you slid that piece of
paper across the table and you made your

469
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,470
off for say, my Dick and balls
bring home this each year,

470
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:44,310
they're like, yeah, keep it
moving. Keep it moving. That's,

471
00:27:44,311 --> 00:27:48,360
that's 10 grand less than I want. And
you got that one snaggletooth fuck off.

472
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:52,440
Move on. Who's next? Go ahead. Put your
junk on the table. What's your number?

473
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:59,230
Okay. And he has it. And here's the thing,

474
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,850
I don't fault women for that.

475
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,293
Yeah.

476
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:06,100
Who would still live like a bumped if
you're good and if you're good looking

477
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:11,020
enough. Okay. And you can land somebody
that's making a ton of fucking money,

478
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:16,960
you can learn to love
that. Right? I Dunno.

479
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:18,201
So anyway,

480
00:28:18,201 --> 00:28:21,220
so now he gets busted for drinking and
driving in that this is the bottom line.

481
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:25,650
This fucking guys fall from
grace. Okay. All right.

482
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,950
I'll give you the first fucking
couple of years after his divorce,

483
00:28:28,951 --> 00:28:31,130
like maybe that got in his fucking
head, but at the end of that,

484
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,420
I mean either you got
divorced 10 fucking years ago.

485
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:40,510
What happened was was his marriage and
his body broke down at the same fucking

486
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:43,600
time, but guy just had major back
surgeries. Knees are fucked up.

487
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:45,630
And they always said,

488
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:49,870
they said back when everybody thought
he was a family band back east,

489
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,220
that um,

490
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:55,240
the way that the level of Torque and the
pressure that he's putting on his back,

491
00:28:55,241 --> 00:28:57,910
they predicted his body was
going to break down and it did.

492
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:01,150
And then when it does, you know, now
they're going to blame, you know,

493
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:03,370
it's okay.

494
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:06,730
Classic Lady's just taking credit. That's
all it is. They always take it behind.

495
00:29:06,731 --> 00:29:09,520
Yabby Greg man is a good
woman, you know, they, okay.

496
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:14,780
All right. Is it, I don't know, I
mean, what's your definition of great?

497
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,693
I mean,

498
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,580
but every great man is a great woman.

499
00:29:21,581 --> 00:29:23,920
It's like the guy was already a
fucking champion when he met you.

500
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:25,110
Yeah.

501
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:27,360
So He's, if you're talking about his
mother, I'll, I'll give you that.

502
00:29:27,361 --> 00:29:29,040
But this whole fucking thing.
Well now, I mean, Jesus,

503
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:31,050
I got to tell you his mugshot.
Oh, that's a classic one.

504
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,480
I'd like to have a couple
of pops with tiger.

505
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:40,980
Oh, lease. Yet. He needs,
this is what he needs to,

506
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:44,850
he needs to hit the fucking
treadmill. All right.

507
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:49,450
And he's got to shave his fucking
head already. You got to let that go.

508
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:54,220
You know. Oh God. He comes to Monday
morning. He comes to MMP Photoshop.

509
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:57,400
Can you please Photoshop
my fucking head underneath?

510
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,753
Hello.

511
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:04,210
Tiger Woods is fucking air. Uh, God.

512
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:08,140
You know what's funny is he
looks like he's fucking wasted.

513
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:11,170
But you know what he's saying? He's
looking into the camera going, well,

514
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,300
I know a billion people
are going to see this.

515
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:18,130
What the fuck are they going
to say about this one? Um,

516
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:24,370
I don't, I can't even to begin to
tell you guys. I, I can't, I can't,

517
00:30:24,371 --> 00:30:24,561
I don't even,

518
00:30:24,561 --> 00:30:27,580
I can't even begin to tell you guys how
bad I want to see this guy win a major

519
00:30:27,581 --> 00:30:30,580
again. Uh,

520
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:35,360
look at this editor's pick the secret
history of tiger woods. Now how,

521
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,900
how much do you think they
actually talked to tiger woods?

522
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:43,710
So the death of his father set a battle
raging inside the world's greatest

523
00:30:43,711 --> 00:30:47,370
golfer dish. Dish. How
the fuck do you know?

524
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:51,960
Why could you talk to his gardener? Is
that the closest you could get to them?

525
00:30:51,961 --> 00:30:55,500
And now you gonna write 400 pages
of bullshit. Listen, do me a favor.

526
00:30:55,530 --> 00:31:00,090
Don't listen to any of this stuff.
Okay? He's a man. He makes mistakes.

527
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,630
He's in the public eye. I hope his
back gets better. You know what?

528
00:31:03,631 --> 00:31:07,600
I hope he goes out like fucking who's
that guy used to fucking just sit there

529
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:11,070
and the big dude, the blonde hair,

530
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,840
and he's fucking sit there.

531
00:31:12,841 --> 00:31:15,350
I think he played Oliver on the
Brady Bunch way back in the date.

532
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:18,690
And then when he grew up, he became this
drunk. He was this alcoholic fucking,

533
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:23,850
he could get hit the ball of fucking Mya.
God dammit. This is going to kill me.

534
00:31:23,851 --> 00:31:24,840
I got to look this up here.

535
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:26,830
Okay.

536
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:29,800
Alcoholic Golfer

537
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:36,670
driver long. That's how I search.

538
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:42,640
And John Daly. There we
go. Bam. Nailed it. Um,

539
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:43,503
John.

540
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:45,913
Okay.

541
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:50,820
You know, I hope he comes
back like a combination like

542
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:56,270
I dunno. Dot Terminator and
John Daly. That's what I want.

543
00:31:56,930 --> 00:32:01,580
I want a fucking drunk cyborg going out
there and I hope he fucking passes Jack

544
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,930
Nicholas and just, you know,

545
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:07,670
I don't understand people that look at
people in the public eye to the point

546
00:32:07,671 --> 00:32:09,260
that they, they disappoint them.

547
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,240
Yeah.

548
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,220
You know, get a fucking life.

549
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:14,640
Okay.

550
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,870
Jesus Christ. Oh,

551
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:18,290
what it was that fucking movie
called Captain Kirk when he did,

552
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:22,800
he did the sketch talking to the
trekkies on SNL, get a fucking life.

553
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,793
Okay.

554
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,560
You know, guys, I don't know.

555
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:29,230
I don't know if you noticed the last
couple of weeks I've been a little, uh,

556
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,570
I don't know. I've been a
little down, you know, and uh,

557
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,150
I know the podcast hasn't been as good
as it has been in the past and it's just

558
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,780
cause, uh, uh, you know, a tie
feel like tiger woods let me down.

559
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:46,460
You know, all those times I've never
met him or even remotely spoken to him.

560
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,210
Um, you know,

561
00:32:50,211 --> 00:32:54,140
I just really thought we had something
there and for him to turn around and go

562
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:57,570
back on his word that he never gave
me because I've never spoken with the

563
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,870
matches. I was devastated. And, uh,

564
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:02,390
I'm not going to be able
to come into work today.

565
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:10,820
Oh Man. I hope that guy wins another
fucking major. I can't even tell you.

566
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:13,190
I can't even, I can't even fucking,
I just didn't tell you, didn't I,

567
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:17,570
I think I just did tell you, um, hey,

568
00:33:17,571 --> 00:33:21,800
last week I was talking about
helicopters and, uh, you know,

569
00:33:21,801 --> 00:33:25,580
I know some pilots listened to this
fucking thing, you know, mass bumping,

570
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:30,170
all that shit. You have to deal with low
g pushover with the fucking semi, uh,

571
00:33:30,171 --> 00:33:33,170
articulated rotor system. Does anybody
know about these? Fucking these,

572
00:33:33,171 --> 00:33:36,700
these new European helicopters that are
starting to be available over here and

573
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,830
it has a fully articulated rotor system
so you don't have to deal with any of

574
00:33:39,831 --> 00:33:43,070
that shit and the fuel injected. So
there's no, do I need to pull carb heat?

575
00:33:43,071 --> 00:33:47,160
Am I going to fucking die here? Um, it's
called, I don't know how to say a g U.

576
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:52,130
I M B a l gamble Cabri g two.

577
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,320
And I wrote next to it once the deal, um,

578
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:00,260
I talked to two of my instructors,
one of them said, hey,

579
00:34:00,261 --> 00:34:02,330
that's pretty cool that they do
that. And the other one said, well,

580
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:03,080
it's kind of like,

581
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,720
remember when the first iPhone
came out cause they're brand new.

582
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:09,380
Then they had to work all
the bugs out. He said, uh,

583
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:14,020
they learned about aircraft through
people crashing. So I was like, all right,

584
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:19,300
fuck those things then. Um, anyway, so
you know, you don't, I was thinking,

585
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:21,800
I think one of these days when I'm going
to do is I'm just going to buy a used

586
00:34:21,801 --> 00:34:25,940
Apache, you know, or
whatever the fuck they have.

587
00:34:25,941 --> 00:34:27,550
Those Blackhawks is some shit.

588
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:30,230
I'm just going to learn how to fly that
and then I'm just going to join those

589
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:34,460
blackwater dudes. That's my apocalypse
thing. You know what I mean?

590
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,950
I'm not going to learn how to
kill people or anything like that.

591
00:34:36,951 --> 00:34:38,060
I'll just be the shuttle guy.

592
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:42,500
I'll take you back from the front lines
back to base base camp and I'll just sit

593
00:34:42,501 --> 00:34:45,590
there eating my soup. That's
my game plan. I'm all right.

594
00:34:45,591 --> 00:34:47,930
Let's read some of the fucking
advertising here for this week,

595
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:52,830
which of course I didn't even deny even
look this shit up yet. No, I didn't. Uh,

596
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:57,020
I apologize for this. You know, I just,
it's just tiger woods let me down.

597
00:34:57,021 --> 00:35:00,200
You know, I thought he was a
family member and, uh, I mean,

598
00:35:00,201 --> 00:35:02,150
I haven't been this fucking,

599
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:09,070
I haven't been this
fucking distraught since,

600
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:10,670
uh,

601
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:15,670
Michael Jordan's acceptance speech at
the hall of fame when I found out who he

602
00:35:16,671 --> 00:35:17,840
really was. I mean,

603
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:21,740
I was devastated and I just remember
all those times I had not hung out with

604
00:35:21,741 --> 00:35:25,160
Michael Jordan or ever talked to him.
And I just feel like he really just,

605
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:31,190
you know, I just thought he was
better than that. I love that.

606
00:35:31,191 --> 00:35:32,960
When he gave that speech and
everyone was like, wait a minute,

607
00:35:32,961 --> 00:35:35,930
this guy's like fucking got ice
water in his veins and he's,

608
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:38,200
he's got a mean streak
him. It's like, yeah,

609
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:43,920
yeah. All those fucking people
who are never picked in gym class.

610
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:45,600
They were like, oh, this is why I sucked.

611
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,170
It wasn't just that I was uncoordinated.

612
00:35:49,171 --> 00:35:53,490
I didn't have this killer
fucking instinct. He went
after his own Goddamn kids,

613
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:58,630
you know? And that's what it takes. All
right. Me On the better though though.

614
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:03,260
Mandy's beyond these Michael Jordan's
fucking long shorts dude too. To me,

615
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:06,420
Andy's me undies there that
long because it was dark.

616
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:10,050
He's fucking six six so it says Dick,

617
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:14,400
but his balls were rough until he got
me undies and then he made the hall of

618
00:36:14,401 --> 00:36:14,881
fame.

619
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:18,770
He finally beat the fucking
Pistons because his pissed
inn was nice and fucking

627
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:46,440
our fabric three times softer than cotton.

628
00:36:46,441 --> 00:36:50,640
You know it's true because you have never
heard the cotton lobby ever debated.

629
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,240
There's soft, stretchy undies coming.

630
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:58,980

That's because me undies believes in

Mandy's will donate $1 to
the Los Angeles LGBT center.

639
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:31,470
A you, you're pandering to your audience.

640
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:36,050
You got a bunch of colorful underwear,
right? I'd see what's going on.

641
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:38,130
You'd get did a little algorithm. Well,

642
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:42,710
more gay people than Straits a
by in these, you know we, oh,

643
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:46,980
maybe we got maybe gay people
by the gay people. Gay Guys.

644
00:37:46,981 --> 00:37:51,810
I bet gay guys buy more underwear,
more underwear than straight guys too.

645
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:55,470
You know, because women are so fucking
forgiving, right? But guys are so visual,

646
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,390
so maybe gay guys are like,

647
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:00,990
I just feel a pressure that I always
have to have new underwear on because I

648
00:38:00,991 --> 00:38:03,480
just feel such, I just feel like for me,

649
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,110
when somebody sees my Dick and ball first,

650
00:38:07,111 --> 00:38:11,130
I want to have a brand new pair of
meundies. Good for them, good for them.

651
00:38:11,131 --> 00:38:14,400

that's true. Generally speaking,

652
00:38:14,401 --> 00:38:18,450
gay men have newer cleaner underwear
than a straight guy, right?

00:42:23,721 --> 00:42:28,020
gave you a cheap shave or spend a
fortune on razors with gimmickry shaving

719
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:32,750
technology so you didn't need and
when you use DOK Dollar Shave Clubs,

720
00:42:32,751 --> 00:42:36,650
executive razor with the
doctor cabbies, easy shit.

721
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:39,580
[inaudible]

722
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:42,600
bled gently glides giving
you a smooth shave.

723
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:48,140
Dr Carver's shave butter is
transparent for a more precise shave,

724
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:51,660
helps prevent ingrown hairs
and fights. Razor bumps,

725
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,870
make the smarter choice by
dot. Joining Dollar Shave Club.

726
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:59,160
Do you know the people at Dollar Shave
Club at a custom Dr Covey's easy shave

727
00:42:59,161 --> 00:43:00,600
butter tube that they framed?

728
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:04,620
Andrew finally was able to convince
me to take the thing. He goes,

729
00:43:04,621 --> 00:43:07,050
they gave you something. I'm
like, I don't want any more shit.

730
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:10,620
I got too much shit. Then he goes,
now you got to see this thing.

731
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:13,680
And like fucking a year later I
finally got it from him and I'm like,

732
00:43:13,681 --> 00:43:14,670
God dammit.

733
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:18,990
That's another thing I got to
put up on the wall in some day.

734
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:21,300
Explained to people, Oh,

735
00:43:21,301 --> 00:43:25,290
I have mild dyslexia and I thought
Dr Carver's shave butter said,

736
00:43:25,291 --> 00:43:29,430
Dr Carver's easy shave butter, and I
used to scream it and it's like cheap.

737
00:43:29,431 --> 00:43:32,130
Bill. Do you have any more boring
stories framed on your wall?

738
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:35,400
Yes. Yes I do. Okay.

739
00:43:35,401 --> 00:43:38,940
Make the smarter choice by joining
Dollar Shave Club for a limited time.

minutes in. Just like that.

747
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:15,570
Okay. All right. Let's read these fucking,

748
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:21,570
let's read these fucking questions
here. All Right, Europe. Hi.

749
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:26,310
That's it. I like it. Short and sweet.
Been a huge fan of bill for many years.

750
00:44:26,311 --> 00:44:28,860
Are there any plans for
touring Europe specifically?

751
00:44:28,861 --> 00:44:31,830
The Netherlands would love to see him live

752
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,110
while I was there last year. Man,

753
00:44:34,111 --> 00:44:38,380
if you will for a fan for many years
you should have checked my website. Um,

754
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:43,460
I think I'm going to go to Europe next
year and I'll probably build it around.

755
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,520
Um, a couple of F1 racist possibly.

756
00:44:47,521 --> 00:44:48,870
I don't know when I'm
going to go over there,

757
00:44:48,871 --> 00:44:53,310
but I'm definitely due to do a
run. I've got a bunch of new shit,

758
00:44:53,311 --> 00:44:54,144
but you know,

759
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:57,210
I have to make sure it's at a
certain level before I go over there.

760
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:01,290
Cause Europe, he loves to just have
critic show up at shows without, you know,

761
00:45:01,291 --> 00:45:04,080
the artist saying, Hey, can
you review this show? You know,

762
00:45:04,081 --> 00:45:09,081
and they review it any way and they take
out their fucking goddamn steak knives

763
00:45:09,211 --> 00:45:10,770
and they carve you up every fucking time.

764
00:45:10,771 --> 00:45:13,440
So I always make sure I'm on my game here.

765
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:17,790
All right girl who stabbed boyfriend
isn't walking free. Okay, here we go.

766
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:19,770
This is the new, this is
new part of the podcast.

767
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,450
Everybody fucking correct
and old bill, you know.

768
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:28,260
[inaudible] that's why I made sure
to fucking like look up all my, uh,

769
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:33,030
my F1 shit. You know, cause
you caught damn cots, um,

770
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:36,630
girl who stabbed boyfriend. I have
a prediction about the red sox too,

771
00:45:36,631 --> 00:45:40,500
by the way, which I will get to later
on, hopefully if I remember. All right,

772
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:43,590
that's a teaser and I might let
you down. I might disappoint you.

773
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:47,730
Like Michael Jordan, like
fucking tiger woods, you know,

774
00:45:47,731 --> 00:45:49,830
all that entertainment that
they gave you when they watch,

775
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:53,960
when you get to watch them doing things
that had never been done before. Um,

776
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:57,300
all right girl who stabbed
boyfriend isn't walking free. Okay.

777
00:45:57,301 --> 00:46:01,140
So this story was about a,
some lady at Oxford to fucking,

778
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:02,760
I don't know what the hell she did.

779
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,970
She stabbed her boyfriend in the leg
with a bread knife and blah, blah, blah,

780
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:10,020
blah, blah. And that, that guy
was like, well, I don't you have,

781
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:14,820
you know, yeah, I have all
this fucking, you know,

782
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,800
potential and all this type
of shit. So this person, um,

783
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:23,190
this person is writing back saying
she isn't going free. What's up?

784
00:46:23,191 --> 00:46:27,240
I realize you like to make the excuse
that we shouldn't expect you to do any

785
00:46:27,241 --> 00:46:30,870
actual research on stories you
talk about and that's fine.

786
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:36,300
Well then you should leave it at that,
sir. But in this particular story,

787
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:39,000
you ranted on Thursday's
pod. I didn't rant.

788
00:46:39,001 --> 00:46:41,730
I'm joking around you
fucking overreacting.

789
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:46,830
Conc do you guys understand
what a rant is? Rant to me.

790
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:48,330
It's short for ranting and raving.

791
00:46:48,331 --> 00:46:51,510
So you've got borderline have froth
coming out of your fucking mouth.

792
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:55,140
Joking around about a subject for
five minutes is not a fucking rant.

793
00:46:55,141 --> 00:46:58,900
You stupid. Fuck God dammit.

794
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:03,980
All right. So even like right
there, to me, that's just,

795
00:47:03,981 --> 00:47:08,530
I just fucking fucking wigged up for
a second there, but he re rant it.

796
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,910
Okay, I'm on Thursday. You didn't even,

797
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:15,740
you didn't even need to do research
to see how wrong you were. Again,

798
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:17,630
I'm not wrong. I'm being funny.

799
00:47:17,631 --> 00:47:22,631
You fuck that Oxford girl isn't
getting off free because she's white.

800
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:23,743
Oh my God.

801
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:29,680
As the lovely Nia proposed and not
because she's a woman as the biliterate

802
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:33,130
birth suggested. She isn't
getting off at all. In fact,

803
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:37,240
it said right on the article you were
reading that she was going to be sentenced

804
00:47:37,241 --> 00:47:41,980
in September and has been giving
a restraining order. Yeah,

805
00:47:41,981 --> 00:47:45,970
I saw that and I also read
the fucking judge's quote.

806
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:49,010
I looked it up and I read
along with your pocket.

807
00:47:49,011 --> 00:47:53,600
So sentencing was only postpone. She
isn't getting out of jail time yet.

808
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:56,420
Yeah, but don't you find it fucked
up? What are you going to address?

809
00:47:56,421 --> 00:47:58,610
The fact that the judge
said you're so talented,

810
00:47:58,611 --> 00:48:02,030
I don't want to derail your fucking
what you could possibly achieve.

811
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,880
You don't think that's
weird for him to say that.

812
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:06,013
Yeah,

813
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:11,430
and you don't think race and
gender affects your sentencing.

814
00:48:11,971 --> 00:48:15,120
You don't think that? You don't think
that any day that there's all this racism,

815
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:18,780
there's all this sexism and all that,
but in the court of law there isn't.

816
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:21,870
There isn't status. There isn't.

817
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:25,680
You're at Oxford versus you did somebody
on the street and you stabbed somebody

818
00:48:25,681 --> 00:48:28,800
with the fucking knife. You don't think
that any of that comes into play, sir.

819
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:33,210
So anyways, he says, if you
asked me which you didn't,

820
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:34,890
I think this is a good thing.

821
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:38,340
If she's is as bright as the
people at the school say she is,

822
00:48:38,341 --> 00:48:43,341
she can definitely do a lot of good in
her career and sentencing her for a one

823
00:48:44,281 --> 00:48:47,310
off would ruin that. So
you're agreeing with this guy.

824
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:50,890
Oh my God, this is fucking hilarious.

825
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:52,620
You're sitting there and saying
that I'm not paying this.

826
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:56,110
Basically what it is is
not that I was misinformed.

827
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:02,080
Okay? It's that you agreed with the
judge. He said, that being said,

828
00:49:02,081 --> 00:49:04,480
she needs to be held responsible.

829
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:09,160
So what is it seeing as if
it was only a butter knife?

830
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:14,470
I think mandatory anger management
classes is in order at the very least.

831
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:18,670
Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Come back
to Madison. You were great last time.

832
00:49:18,671 --> 00:49:23,020
Go fuck yourself again, sir. She
stabbed somebody with a knife.

833
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:25,053
Okay,

834
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:31,240
let me let that sink in. She stabbed
someone with a fucking knife,

835
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:35,990
but because she goes to Oxford
and she could be a doctor.

836
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:41,100
Yeah, you're out of your fucking mind.
You're, you're just like the judge.

837
00:49:41,101 --> 00:49:44,010
You're like, oh, look
at her. She's a girl.

838
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:49,110
She's doing so well in
school. She looks like me.

839
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:52,860
It was just a bread knife.
You're doing what they're doing.

840
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,200
In a perfect world, sir,

841
00:49:57,410 --> 00:50:01,640
stabbing somebody with the knife and the
punishment is stabbing somebody with a

842
00:50:01,641 --> 00:50:04,130
knife and the punishment
and that's fucking it.

843
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:07,550
Go Watch that fucking trap car thing
or whatever the fuck they call it,

844
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,520
where they park it down in the fucking
poor neighborhood and they arrest one

845
00:50:10,521 --> 00:50:12,260
black eye after fuck another.

846
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:13,673
Yeah.

847
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,720
I mean it's, it's, they're
not trying to help anybody.

848
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:18,900
You don't think anybody
down there has potential.

849
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:23,880
You just going to say it's going
to fucking do that to them.

850
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:26,990
Why do they just do, why they don't,

851
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:29,120
don't they do that in a
fucking white neighborhood?

852
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:32,093
Okay.

853
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:35,320
Oh my God. I don't know. I don't, I
just don't see the world the way you do,

854
00:50:35,321 --> 00:50:37,720
sir. And you see it the
way that judge does.

855
00:50:37,721 --> 00:50:42,721
And I also think that you are like
what you're taking into consideration.

856
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:43,660
Okay.

857
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:46,930
Which is is the fact that she's at
Oxford and she could be a doctor.

858
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,010
You're completely in your,

859
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:52,870
you're now downplaying that she
stabbed someone and yes you are sir.

860
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:53,823
Yes you are.

861
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:58,330
Because you said she should take an anger
management classes at the very least.

862
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:00,943
Okay,

863
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:04,930
look, you might call me fucking overly
liberal, but if you stab someone,

864
00:51:04,931 --> 00:51:08,740
you should go to jail regardless
of what your potential is.

865
00:51:08,741 --> 00:51:09,820
Do you realize it's this woman,

866
00:51:09,821 --> 00:51:13,870
if she becomes a surgeon will have a
knife in her hand every fucking day of a

867
00:51:14,350 --> 00:51:17,080
goddamn career just about, and it
won't be a fucking butter knife.

868
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,600
Jesus fucking Christ.

869
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:23,600
And when she's goes to cut somebody open
and then finds out that they have state

870
00:51:23,601 --> 00:51:26,210
insurance rather than private, what
the fuck is she going to do then?

871
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:28,270
Okay.

872
00:51:28,270 --> 00:51:31,540
Just because you go to Oxford doesn't
mean you couldn't be a fucking lunatic.

873
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:33,953
You know what I mean?

874
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:39,140
And people in those schools commit
murders and they do commit crimes,

875
00:51:39,141 --> 00:51:43,580
but they don't go to jail to wait.
Poor people with more of a tan do.

876
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:45,200
I don't know if you've noticed that.

877
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:48,680
So for us to bring up the fact that
she was a woman and that she was white.

878
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:53,300
I was not, we were not uninformed.
We were actually Morton. I actually,

879
00:51:53,301 --> 00:51:54,980
you know, I'm going to
pat myself on the back.

880
00:51:54,981 --> 00:51:58,130
I'm more fucking enlightened
than you are. Okay?

881
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,590
Because I'm not saying that because of
who she is, she should get punished more.

882
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:04,100
She should get the punishment.

883
00:52:06,110 --> 00:52:07,970
I think once you stabbed somebody,

884
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:11,780
what the fuck you doing in the rest of
your life is out the goddamn window.

885
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:13,940
Okay.

886
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:15,680
And I know what you guys are
going to say. Well, they do that.

887
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:17,030
They do that all the time.

888
00:52:17,031 --> 00:52:21,250
They fucking take into consideration
if people have children and Blah, blah,

889
00:52:21,251 --> 00:52:25,130
blah, blah. Yeah, I know they
do. But the consideration is,

890
00:52:25,131 --> 00:52:30,050
is a lot smaller by the level of Tan
you have and whether you have a dick

891
00:52:30,051 --> 00:52:32,900
hanging between your legs and
not, and that's the fucking truth.

892
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:38,200
Going to a bar, a woman
can slap a guy in the face,

893
00:52:38,201 --> 00:52:41,080
dump a drink over his fucking
head. She's not getting kicked out.

894
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:47,470
She's not. If she's, if she's hot,
she's a fucking Willdabeast. Yeah.

895
00:52:47,471 --> 00:52:50,970
They'll throw her out in the fucking
dumpster. Come on people. This isn't,

896
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:54,460
this isn't new information. All right.
Stop acting like good Lord. All right.

897
00:52:54,461 --> 00:52:56,920
Why Airlines lost their privilege

898
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:00,990
now. Hey Bill, big fan.

899
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:02,030
Love your podcast.

900
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:05,640
You recently asked why airlines are not
as prestigious as it was in the 70s as a

901
00:53:05,641 --> 00:53:10,250
pilot. I have an answer for you. Oh,
I love when the pilots, right in sky

902
00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:15,790
pilot. Why is, and it's still great.

903
00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:19,030
In 1978 huh? I'm Jim McConnell.

904
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:23,980
Jimmy Carter signed the airline
declar deregulation act.

905
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:25,310
Ah,

906
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:29,220
leave it to a peanut farmer from Georgia
to ruin the fucking prestige of airline

907
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:31,170
travel. Prior to this law,

908
00:53:31,171 --> 00:53:36,171
the government allowed equal usage of
federal airways among all the airlines.

909
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:39,240
All right. You already lost
me. Let me read this slower.

910
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:43,650
The government allowed equal usage of
federal airways among all airlines.

911
00:53:43,651 --> 00:53:48,651
So the only way for airlines to compete
effectively was with good customer

912
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:54,020
service. Okay. After the
law went into effect,

913
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:58,430
airlines were able to bid for
exclusive usage of certain airways.

914
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:02,780
The Airways are basically the
streets in the sky. So different.

915
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:09,480
Okay. Oh, I see. So then, and everybody
had their territory. So it was like,

916
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:15,030
that's right. There was eastern
airlines, they just flew there. Okay.

917
00:54:15,031 --> 00:54:17,850
All right. American and
United flew cross country.

918
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:21,450
So it was like wrestling back in the day
where everybody had their territories

919
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:23,790
and then rather than have one guy

920
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:29,430
dominate the whole thing like
Vince, it became a bidding war.

921
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:32,520
Okay. After the law went into effect,

922
00:54:32,521 --> 00:54:35,910
airlines were able to bid
exclusive usage of certain airways.

923
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:41,990
So Airways essentially gained monopolies
on most of their routes with customers

924
00:54:42,211 --> 00:54:44,850
having little or no say
in which airline to take.

925
00:54:44,851 --> 00:54:48,330
The airlines were able to get us
by the balls. So now airlines,

926
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:53,540
business strategy has shifted from good
customer service to monopolizing their

927
00:54:53,641 --> 00:54:58,641
airways and packing as many people
as possible into their plane planes.

928
00:54:58,771 --> 00:55:02,760
Hope this helps. Ah, it started
to, what should I look up?

929
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:07,170
I should look up the airline deregulation
act now that all of a sudden in the

930
00:55:07,171 --> 00:55:08,610
era of fake news,

931
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,380
I'm being suddenly being held
accountable for what the fuck. I said,

932
00:55:13,381 --> 00:55:16,020
I can't believe this. I, you
guys are so disappointing me.

933
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,850
Can somebody please write in and mock
these fucking assholes. All right?

934
00:55:20,851 --> 00:55:25,260
Not saying that the, the, um, the pilot
here, alright. Airline deregulation act,

935
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:28,980
airline D, Reg.

936
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:34,250
You Lation Act Jimmy Carter and affects,

937
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:40,650
let's see what we got
here. Oh my God. All right.

938
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:45,180
Wiki a law that changed the airline
industry. That's the one that looks like,

939
00:55:45,181 --> 00:55:47,040
okay, this is the one I will read up on.

940
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:50,750
Are you guys going to try to make
me informed and then I'll join?

941
00:55:50,751 --> 00:55:52,860
You know what happens when you
don't have to become you informed.

942
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:57,450
You become an arrogant ass. You
know, you start smoking a pipe.

943
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:01,290
You fucking eyebrows are always trying
to touch each other as your wrinkle up

944
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:04,710
your forehead. No one wants
to be around that. All right?

945
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:09,540
A law that changed the airline
industry beyond recognition. 1978.

946
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,480
All right?

947
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:17,340
Okay. Before deregulations
airlines competed on service alone,

948
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:22,350
as fairs were regulated by the
government, I didn't know that. I mean,

949
00:56:22,351 --> 00:56:24,490
granted I was fucking 10 years old, 1978.

950
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:28,390
Many remember this era fondly
is the golden age of aviation.

951
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:33,250
When stewardesses as
flight attendants, uh,

952
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,470
were then known. Carved,

953
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:42,840
I can chateau Breon on rolling silver
carts and airlines put piano lounges and

954
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:48,780
upper decks of their Boeing seven 40
sevens passengers dressed up to board

955
00:56:48,791 --> 00:56:53,710
flights and flying was glamorous and
exciting and mainly for the rich.

956
00:56:54,130 --> 00:56:55,360
Ah, that's why the liberals

957
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:59,740
deregulations resulted in the
rise of a new kind of airline.

958
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:04,690
The low cost carrier LCC at
the time of deregulation,

959
00:57:04,691 --> 00:57:09,691
southwest airline was a small regional
airline prevented by cab rules.

960
00:57:10,451 --> 00:57:14,110
I don't know what that is from
flying outside of Texas today,

961
00:57:14,111 --> 00:57:18,880
southwest is the largest domestic us
carrier in terms of passenger traffic.

962
00:57:19,090 --> 00:57:22,390
Something no one could
have foreseen in 1978 yeah,

963
00:57:22,391 --> 00:57:25,120
and that's back when
stewardesses were fucking hot.

964
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:30,940
So now it's a bunch of animals. They
pack us all in and then it's just like,

965
00:57:30,941 --> 00:57:32,770
yeah, all the hotties
are like, well fuck this.

966
00:57:32,771 --> 00:57:36,870
I'm going to go a sell Jello shots at
a goddamn one of those DJ shows. Wait,

967
00:57:36,871 --> 00:57:40,290
Bay Bay. Bay Bay. Wow.
Wow, wow, wow. Wow. Right.

968
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:45,040
Southwest is a success story,
but deregulation aloud. Yeah.

969
00:57:45,041 --> 00:57:48,690
I hate flying southwest. I
fucking hate it. You know why?

970
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:52,150
I hate how the stewardess is sit there
and making jokes and fucking around.

971
00:57:52,151 --> 00:57:54,160
It's like, dude, my life
is in your hands here.

972
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:58,210
You're not making me more relaxed doing
your fucking Dean Martin impression.

973
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:04,310
Uh, but deregulation allowed airlines
to innovate new business models. People,

974
00:58:04,311 --> 00:58:08,420
people express, I remember that.
Remember value jet, that one went down.

975
00:58:08,421 --> 00:58:12,770
People Express may have come and
gone. It may someday be revived,

976
00:58:12,771 --> 00:58:17,771
but it and others like it shook up the
white glove world of the U s airline

977
00:58:18,651 --> 00:58:19,610
industry. And

978
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:21,513
Yeah,

979
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:23,740
democracies travel.
Hope I said that right.

980
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:29,100
We may peer through our rose colored
glasses and yearn for the days of Chateau.

981
00:58:29,471 --> 00:58:31,330
Bring all in piano lounges.

982
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:37,220
But ultimately companies like southwest
and newer ones like spirit allowed more

983
00:58:37,221 --> 00:58:41,090
people to fly more often. Yeah.
And now look at the result.

984
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:45,670
You've got people with no shoes on
walking into the bathroom. Oh my God,

985
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,690
it all fucking came full circle.

986
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:48,913
Okay.

987
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:51,310
Holy Shit. Do I like being informed?

988
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:56,910
Deregulation left the international
carriers like Pan Am and Braniff and to a

989
00:58:57,101 --> 00:58:58,720
lesser extent, Twa,

990
00:58:58,721 --> 00:59:03,550
Trans World Airlines without
robust domestic feeder networks.

991
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:05,441
I don't know what that means.

992
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:09,430
And it allowed domestic carriers like
Delta airlines to apply for international

993
00:59:09,431 --> 00:59:13,660
routes. Pan-Am and Braniff scrambled
to create domestic networks,

994
00:59:13,661 --> 00:59:15,340
but ultimately were unsuccessful,

995
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:20,440
although it took until 2000 for Twa
to be absorbed into American Airlines.

996
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:22,920
And some argue with it,

997
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:26,890
massive consolidation of the u s
airline industry in the last decade,

998
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:32,290
which has resulted in three large
carriers for when southwest is included is

999
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:37,420
deregulations final act. Then
network carriers that survive delta,

1000
00:59:37,421 --> 00:59:42,310
United and American learn to be tough
competitors and combined existing domestic

1001
00:59:42,311 --> 00:59:46,300
networks with the international networks
acquired in large part by carriers like

1002
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:49,870
Pan Am that didn't make
it get the fuck out.

1003
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:54,580
So now they have to drag people
off flights, barefooted, lunatics,

1004
00:59:55,330 --> 00:59:58,190
and then you've got
people fucking, you know,

1005
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,790
you haven't seen those people that just
fly around the world all the time trying

1006
01:00:00,791 --> 01:00:03,730
to get in miles and shit just
created all these bottom feeders.

1007
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:10,080
Wow. Do you think a VIP airline
would, would make it? I wonder,

1008
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:14,700
you know, in this era of
Donald Trump, if they just,

1009
01:00:14,770 --> 01:00:19,410
if they didn't even try to
be nice, just be, I wish,

1010
01:00:19,411 --> 01:00:20,610
I wish I could do a Trump impression.

1011
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:25,500
She'd be a lot of animals if flying
bear food, a lot of benefit and then,

1012
01:00:25,501 --> 01:00:25,960
you know,

1013
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:26,850
liberals would be like, do you,

1014
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:29,850
we use saying that beer footy
people shouldn't be allowed to

1015
01:00:30,410 --> 01:00:35,320
let it be your feet.
Let a pair of feet to,

1016
01:00:35,321 --> 01:00:39,740
can you, what if want,
if they had a fuck it,

1017
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:42,410
you couldn't do it nowadays
if you had a fucking

1018
01:00:44,030 --> 01:00:48,290
topline airline, okay.
All first class seats,

1019
01:00:48,590 --> 01:00:53,150
all hot stewardesses, you know,
first of all, all the fucking,

1020
01:00:53,151 --> 01:00:57,260
you know, all the fucking
feminists would be up in arms,

1021
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:02,030
would all be up in arms saying that
they, you're objectifying these women,

1022
01:01:02,270 --> 01:01:05,090
blah blah, blah, blah, blah. And
at the end of the F, I dunno,

1023
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:07,280
I agree with some of that feminist shit,

1024
01:01:07,281 --> 01:01:11,000
but a lot of times I just feel like
it's women who aren't good looking,

1025
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:15,230
hating on good looking women and just
being mad that could look and women don't

1026
01:01:15,231 --> 01:01:17,870
have to work as hard. You know,

1027
01:01:19,190 --> 01:01:20,390
it's like

1028
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:23,950
that whole thing that you're going
to somehow get people to give,

1029
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:28,330
not as good looking women, not as
good looking men, not as strong men,

1030
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:30,000
like a chance. That's not how it works.

1031
01:01:30,130 --> 01:01:34,690
You gotta like you gotta look at it like
sports and realize that you're not the

1032
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:39,040
Jordan. You're not Sidney Crosby.
All right? You're on the fourth line,

1033
01:01:40,090 --> 01:01:44,980
okay? So what you have to be is you have
to be a fucking, you gotta be a Gamer.

1034
01:01:45,970 --> 01:01:50,380
You know, this is coming from a bald,
redheaded male. So go fuck yourself.

1035
01:01:50,381 --> 01:01:53,500
If you think I'm being elitist
here, okay? You gotta be scrappy.

1036
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:56,080
You got to go in the corners, all right?

1037
01:01:56,190 --> 01:02:00,970
You've got to drop the gloves every once
in a while you got to do that, okay?

1038
01:02:00,971 --> 01:02:02,530
You're not gonna get the calls.

1039
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:05,890
You're going to have to work 10 times
fucking harder than other people to get,

1040
01:02:05,891 --> 01:02:09,340
you know, half as much or
however the expression goes.

1041
01:02:09,341 --> 01:02:14,110
But it's gonna make you stronger. You
know what's great is your fall from grace,

1042
01:02:14,111 --> 01:02:18,400
from your youth. Six as you slide
into a four is not that bad.

1043
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:20,160
But at the end of
everybody's life, everybody

1044
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,280
looks like a four or a two. Okay.

1045
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:24,240
Yeah,

1046
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,300
but you have a nice soft landing.
You do a little bit of a belly flop.

1047
01:02:27,301 --> 01:02:30,450
You get the wind knocked out of
you between 20 and 60 all right.

1048
01:02:30,451 --> 01:02:34,920
These fucking tents. I mean, they're
falling off the top of a goddamn building.

1049
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:39,280
Okay? They in a lot of them, they
don't survive it. They don't.

1050
01:02:39,281 --> 01:02:42,610
If you look at their botox faces,
they look like they landed face first.

1051
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:46,390
They fucking lips are all
swollen. I mean, Jesus Christ,

1052
01:02:46,391 --> 01:02:50,980
look at these fucking Mike Watches
this show and these women will not stop

1053
01:02:51,010 --> 01:02:55,810
taking fat from the back of their arms
and injected them in their ass and they

1054
01:02:55,811 --> 01:03:00,700
got these stupid look and fucking acids
now and their legs look like my legs

1055
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:03,850
with this weird, like
they look like ostriches.

1056
01:03:08,110 --> 01:03:12,120
I don't know why they did that. I, I just,

1057
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:15,120
I just don't fucking
understand why and what point.

1058
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:19,050
It's like they're literally like Michael
Jackson where Michael Jackson couldn't

1059
01:03:19,051 --> 01:03:20,280
see what he's doing to his face.

1060
01:03:20,281 --> 01:03:24,540
These women cannot see what they're doing
to their asses. I don't understand it.

1061
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:25,180
So anyways,

1062
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:27,570
do you know what that was
actually fascinating and I
make fun of the fact that

1063
01:03:27,571 --> 01:03:31,950
I'm not a well read guy cause it gives
me license to be lazy and that's what I

1064
01:03:31,951 --> 01:03:35,580
like to do best. Okay. But if you fucking
assholes, they're going to meet me.

1065
01:03:35,581 --> 01:03:39,780
Keep reading. I did. I did enjoy
that. I do enjoy, I like drum shit.

1066
01:03:39,781 --> 01:03:42,020
I like aviation. I like that
type of shit. All right,

1067
01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:46,560
so if you're going to fucking really
start, hold my feet to the fire here,

1068
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:49,290
could you please try to keep it a,

1069
01:03:51,140 --> 01:03:51,973
I don't know.

1070
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:53,550
Well I guess I have the power, right?

1071
01:03:53,551 --> 01:03:57,570
I have the power where
I can actually decide,

1072
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:00,660
um,

1073
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:04,410
what the fuck it is that I want to
read or what I don't want to read. Um,

1074
01:04:04,770 --> 01:04:05,281
speaking of which,

1075
01:04:05,281 --> 01:04:09,000
for some reason I woke up this morning
thinking about Roy Haynes and the fact

1076
01:04:09,001 --> 01:04:12,930
that he's still alive and still doing
gigs and all the fucking people these

1077
01:04:12,931 --> 01:04:15,750
played with, like I saw a bunch of
great jazz dramas before they passed.

1078
01:04:15,751 --> 01:04:18,930
I saw a Max Roach. I saw Tony Williams,

1079
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,140
I saw Louie Bellson and I saw Roy Haynes.

1080
01:04:22,141 --> 01:04:24,810
I saw Roy Haynes like 20 something
years ago when he was in his seventies.

1081
01:04:24,811 --> 01:04:28,200
He's now 92 and I looked it up
like, is this guy still on the road?

1082
01:04:28,201 --> 01:04:29,610
He's got a road gig coming up

1083
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:31,860
and uh,

1084
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:35,570
September, like the blue note in
New York City and he's from Roxbury,

1085
01:04:35,571 --> 01:04:39,770
Massachusetts. A fellow Boston guy.

1086
01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:42,710
I'm a suburb guy. He's
actually in Boston. But um,

1087
01:04:44,370 --> 01:04:44,880
yeah,

1088
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,170
I don't know. I think
that's pretty fucking cool.

1089
01:04:46,171 --> 01:04:48,770
That guy's still gigging
out there. I mean,

1090
01:04:48,850 --> 01:04:53,220
you talk about a guy he
played with Charlie Parker,
Miles Davis, Sarah Vaughan,

1091
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:57,320
all the way, all the way up. Right
up through like young people today.

1092
01:04:57,590 --> 01:05:00,800
The guy's been playing drums
professionally for 70 goddamn years,

1093
01:05:01,610 --> 01:05:04,400
so I dunno if you're into drums, you
got to go see that guy. All right,

1094
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:07,010
let me go, uh, let me
read some more of the, uh,

1095
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:12,620
all right, let me read these
last two. Cultural appropriation.

1096
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:14,780
Dear Billy rationale,

1097
01:05:14,830 --> 01:05:18,220
a things are getting crazy these days
because of technology. It's definitely

1098
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:21,070
a lot easier to be critical
of what everyone does.

1099
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:25,360
I'm sure you've experienced this before
where people try and misrepresent what

1100
01:05:25,361 --> 01:05:30,070
you say for whatever self-serving
reason they may have. Yes,

1101
01:05:30,071 --> 01:05:33,060
of course. That would be
the Huffington Post. Uh,

1102
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:37,960
one of the things going on today that
really bugs me is the accusation of

1103
01:05:37,961 --> 01:05:42,790
cultural appropriation. I hate picking
extreme sides to any arguments.

1104
01:05:42,791 --> 01:05:43,990
So I will say,

1105
01:05:44,050 --> 01:05:48,250
I do think that there are
cases of cultural disrespect.

1106
01:05:48,850 --> 01:05:53,140
Let's say someone wears a religious or
cultural garb and is overly disrespectful

1107
01:05:53,141 --> 01:05:55,750
for the purpose of
trolling. That could be,

1108
01:05:56,050 --> 01:05:59,980
that could be cultural appropriation.
You put that in quotes.

1109
01:05:59,981 --> 01:06:02,290
So do you not think it is a,

1110
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:05,890
but almost everything anyone does is
derived from another culture in some

1111
01:06:05,891 --> 01:06:06,724
respect.

1112
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:12,250
There is a youtube video where a young
black college girl borates a hippie for

1113
01:06:12,430 --> 01:06:16,990
his corn rolls and it seems a bit silly
because a kid is just doing what every

1114
01:06:16,991 --> 01:06:21,190
other wookies who listened to fish
do. I don't know what a wookie is.

1115
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:26,230
Is that somebody in Indian Shabaka
now fucked up. I got to look this up.

1116
01:06:26,231 --> 01:06:27,064
What the fuck is a way

1117
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:30,890
a white something.

1118
01:06:32,930 --> 01:06:35,060
Wookie meaning slang,

1119
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:39,340
uh, a walkie urban dictionary. A what?

1120
01:06:41,570 --> 01:06:42,540
G. Oh, walkie

1121
01:06:43,550 --> 01:06:45,950
is a Harry yet modernized human being.

1122
01:06:45,951 --> 01:06:48,620
That commonly is seen in the western,

1123
01:06:49,230 --> 01:06:51,530
in the western most regions of Washington,

1124
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:55,520
a gentle creature by nature but
tends to get a little erratic when it

1125
01:06:55,521 --> 01:06:57,980
overindulge itself with
its favorite foods.

1126
01:06:58,550 --> 01:07:01,790
Its diets consists mainly of
a blend of barley and hops.

1127
01:07:02,330 --> 01:07:07,330
If you see these creatures a bit cautious
as to whether you should provide him

1128
01:07:08,990 --> 01:07:10,220
with these items,

1129
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:15,140
they will commonly respond to
the name of Richard Pulliam,

1130
01:07:15,950 --> 01:07:19,280
but be very worry of these
creatures. I have no idea there.

1131
01:07:19,310 --> 01:07:23,510
Usually I'm remembering a certain
brand of cookie that is very chewy.

1132
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:25,733
Oh,

1133
01:07:25,850 --> 01:07:29,730
walkie is a lifeless idiot whose whole
existence consists of falling around jam

1134
01:07:29,731 --> 01:07:30,061
bands.

1135
01:07:30,061 --> 01:07:35,061
Here we go and not showering or shaving
when they're not panhandling or trying

1136
01:07:35,491 --> 01:07:36,480
to rip people off.

1137
01:07:36,481 --> 01:07:40,740
They're selling Veggie burritos or
grilled cheese to fund their useless

1138
01:07:40,741 --> 01:07:44,460
existence. They stand for nothing
and care about nobody else.

1139
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:45,690
Not to be confused.

1140
01:07:45,691 --> 01:07:49,620
What the hippie AP as someone who lives
a certain lifestyle due to their belief.

1141
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:54,800
If these often shower and have jobs a
used in a scented shows yo those wikis

1142
01:07:55,741 --> 01:07:58,830
over there trying to sell beat roles.

1143
01:08:00,540 --> 01:08:03,930
That's from fucking 2003 so I guess
they'd been around for awhile. Okay.

1144
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:07,810
All right. Let me get back to the,
okay, so now I know what a wookie is.

1145
01:08:07,811 --> 01:08:10,720
I know what a Wiki is and I know about
airline deregulation and now I'm going to

1146
01:08:10,721 --> 01:08:11,680
be in suffer both.

1147
01:08:11,681 --> 01:08:14,770
The next fucking social event is I
try to work both of those into the,

1148
01:08:17,390 --> 01:08:18,223
um,

1149
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:19,593
where the fuck is it?

1150
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:24,710
I was an anthropology major,
which doesn't make me an expert,

1151
01:08:24,711 --> 01:08:26,960
but it definitely informs
my opinion of this.

1152
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:31,370
I went to culinary school after college
and learned even more about cultures

1153
01:08:31,371 --> 01:08:32,240
through their food.

1154
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:36,950
I came upon this article and wanting
to get your take upon it to take on a

1155
01:08:36,951 --> 01:08:40,790
couple of girls in Portland, Oregon
started a food truck selling Mexican food.

1156
01:08:40,970 --> 01:08:43,190
They traveled around and learn recipes.

1157
01:08:43,191 --> 01:08:46,340
The way every chef I've
ever known has has done,

1158
01:08:46,690 --> 01:08:50,060
they are accused of cultural
appropriation because they're not Mexican.

1159
01:08:50,330 --> 01:08:54,920
I'm not going to go on a tirade of
motherfucker motherfucks but my adrenaline

1160
01:08:54,921 --> 01:08:56,900
really starts going.
When I think about this.

1161
01:08:56,901 --> 01:09:01,010
I haven't heard you speak about cultural
appropriation yet and wanted to get

1162
01:09:01,011 --> 01:09:04,550
your take. Here's the link.
Oh, the Huffington Post.

1163
01:09:04,730 --> 01:09:08,660
What a fucking surprise.
Thanks for your podcast. Uh,

1164
01:09:08,661 --> 01:09:13,160
you're a great dad and husband. How do
you know that? You have no idea. Um,

1165
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:14,780
I hate the fucking Huffington Post.

1166
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:17,933
Um,

1167
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:20,050
they're always trying to stir
up some shit. You know what? I,

1168
01:09:20,070 --> 01:09:23,420
I hate all these organizations that
try to act like they're their news

1169
01:09:23,450 --> 01:09:26,960
organization and you read two articles
and he know who everybody on the website

1170
01:09:26,961 --> 01:09:30,410
voted for. Essentially.
It's like back in the day,

1171
01:09:30,411 --> 01:09:33,860
like it was supposed to be in
and out. Fewer journalists.

1172
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:36,470
She was supposed to just sort of
present what the fuck happened,

1173
01:09:36,471 --> 01:09:39,620
not making a Om. If you say this, um,

1174
01:09:39,621 --> 01:09:42,980
that's probably because
you're doing that, that site,

1175
01:09:42,981 --> 01:09:45,590
that whole fucking website. And
I shouldn't just single them off.

1176
01:09:45,591 --> 01:09:49,850
There's a bunch of them out there and,
but they're held in like this as steam.

1177
01:09:49,851 --> 01:09:54,830
I just don't understand it. Um,
anyways, cultural appropriation is,

1178
01:09:55,850 --> 01:09:59,930
uh, I don't fucking know why.

1179
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:01,611
You know, look,

1180
01:10:01,611 --> 01:10:05,540
if you have an appreciation for Mexican
food and you still learn how to cook it

1181
01:10:06,170 --> 01:10:09,950
and then you sell it, I think at
that point, if you become successful,

1182
01:10:10,070 --> 01:10:11,780
that's when people get annoyed by it.

1183
01:10:12,740 --> 01:10:17,740
And a college kids are really
extreme in their thoughts as I do.

1184
01:10:18,141 --> 01:10:21,270
You know, you're fucking break
and free your parents, you know,

1185
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:24,530
when you've got some anger issues probably
towards your parents. So you're very,

1186
01:10:24,531 --> 01:10:29,531
you're very open to a radical
fucking sort of ideas,

1187
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:33,380
you know, going all the way over
here, all the way over there.

1188
01:10:33,381 --> 01:10:38,381
It's a very dangerous time in your life
because you make very extreme judgment.

1189
01:10:40,161 --> 01:10:45,080
Snap judgment calls with your
young brain, um, as I did.

1190
01:10:46,190 --> 01:10:50,150
And that can cause you to do
stupid shit. Like join cults,

1191
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:55,070
uh, blow yourself up at a
fucking concert, you know,

1192
01:10:55,071 --> 01:10:59,900
for some stupid fucking
cause all the way to like,

1193
01:10:59,901 --> 01:11:04,580
I don't know what fucking
without a condom. You know,

1194
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:07,220
you just let me pretty fucking wide thing.

1195
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:09,260
This is why you don't
talk about shit like this.

1196
01:11:09,261 --> 01:11:12,320
I don't know what a cultural
appropriation is. I don't know what it is.

1197
01:11:12,390 --> 01:11:15,960
All I know is that my
culture is the matrix,

1198
01:11:16,290 --> 01:11:18,450
so everybody's allowed, you know,

1199
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:22,470
I don't get upset when people get on
airplanes. Ba that's a white shit,

1200
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:23,333
you know?

1201
01:11:25,470 --> 01:11:26,303
Yes.

1202
01:11:29,010 --> 01:11:33,510
Um, I would say that if the two white
girls being white and they're making great

1203
01:11:33,511 --> 01:11:35,280
fucking Mexican food, good for them,

1204
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:38,760
but if they're sitting there wearing
a fucking sombrero and talking like

1205
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:41,880
speeding and zealous when they do
it, yeah, then I would get upset.

1206
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:43,290
But you know,

1207
01:11:43,290 --> 01:11:48,290
there's plenty of Asian in fuse days
and French and fuse that and um,

1208
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:50,420
okay.

1209
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:54,320
Cultures to me and all of
that shit. To me it's like,

1210
01:11:54,830 --> 01:11:59,040
it's like the MMA. How
was the, how was like,

1211
01:11:59,070 --> 01:12:02,310
how good were the martial arts when
it was, you were just one discipline,

1212
01:12:03,330 --> 01:12:07,820
you know, every way I am a
Kido, I am fucking taekwondo.

1213
01:12:08,060 --> 01:12:12,230
I do karate, I fucking box
or whatever. And then a guy,

1214
01:12:12,231 --> 01:12:14,680
Bruce Lee comes around, he's
like, I'll take a little this,

1215
01:12:14,690 --> 01:12:18,620
I'll take a little of that.
Wasn't he doing that? You know,

1216
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:21,780
and then he was teaching it to fucking
the round dyed guys over here and

1217
01:12:21,781 --> 01:12:24,060
everybody over in Asia was
like, hey, that's our shit.

1218
01:12:24,061 --> 01:12:26,760
Don't be showing it to their
shit and now look at it.

1219
01:12:26,790 --> 01:12:28,680
Now look how great the
fucking fighters are.

1220
01:12:29,850 --> 01:12:30,070
Okay.

1221
01:12:30,070 --> 01:12:32,320
You know what I mean? I would
love to see Bruce Lee today,

1222
01:12:32,350 --> 01:12:36,940
if he him back then if he got into the
fucking ring, you know what I mean?

1223
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:42,360
Did he ever have to deal with a double
leg take down what would happen to him?

1224
01:12:42,430 --> 01:12:45,820
Does he have a ground in pound
defense ground and pound didn't exist.

1225
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:50,230
Could that man fight on his back?
That's how much it's progressed.

1226
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:55,680
So I feel everything should
get all fucking mixed up
and then shit spins out of

1227
01:12:56,261 --> 01:12:57,790
that. And he just like, uh,

1228
01:12:58,930 --> 01:13:01,990
I think it's just when you start to act
like you're the thing that you're doing,

1229
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:06,780
you know what I mean? Like, um,
and people do, but the thing is,

1230
01:13:06,781 --> 01:13:08,290
is that if you start getting into like,

1231
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:14,050
like whatever Japanese cuisine, okay, Oh,

1232
01:13:14,051 --> 01:13:17,010
you get into anime, whatever. I'm
watching this animated show. But like,

1233
01:13:17,011 --> 01:13:18,660
I just watch it and I appreciate it.

1234
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:22,770
I don't start walking around with a rising
sun fucking tee shirt and I get some

1235
01:13:22,771 --> 01:13:27,110
swords, you know, Chris crossed
on my walls. Do, you know,

1236
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:30,350
start sitting on the floor and a
pillow with a little short table.

1237
01:13:30,410 --> 01:13:34,540
You know what I mean? I mean, W W I
dunno, I don't know where you, uh,

1238
01:13:34,541 --> 01:13:36,010
I think it's all how you do it.

1239
01:13:39,410 --> 01:13:39,700
I mean,

1240
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:43,400
if I walk into an Asian person's house
and they got a bunch of shit from my Kia,

1241
01:13:43,401 --> 01:13:47,000
I don't go like, you know,
you're appropriating my culture.

1242
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:49,220
What's what that l shaped couch.

1243
01:13:50,530 --> 01:13:55,060
But they're also not oppressing
me and I'm not oppressing anybody,

1244
01:13:55,061 --> 01:13:58,510
but over all the fucking, you know,
long tied concept, the top are.

1245
01:13:58,660 --> 01:14:01,810
So that's what it really
comes down to. It really,

1246
01:14:01,811 --> 01:14:05,980
I think it really comes down to a white
people get held to that standard of, of,

1247
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:11,080
of cultural appropriation
because, uh, you know, we can,

1248
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:14,140
the, the damage we can do and we
can be really ignorant with it.

1249
01:14:14,141 --> 01:14:17,590
And then other times people
are just being conti, like,

1250
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:19,300
I'm not gonna read this fucking article,

1251
01:14:19,301 --> 01:14:21,790
but if it's just a couple of white
chicks making Mexican food and they're

1252
01:14:21,791 --> 01:14:26,320
crushing it, you know, and their dress
like white checks guy like, oh my God,

1253
01:14:26,321 --> 01:14:28,690
who wants the Berretta? I don't
think there's a problem with that.

1254
01:14:28,691 --> 01:14:29,524
If they're killing it.

1255
01:14:30,590 --> 01:14:34,670
Right. It's a fucking food truck. Fill
your pie hole up and shit. I don't know.

1256
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:36,110
All right girlfriend.

1257
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:41,910
I, Hey man. What's up? Um,
I just had a few questions.

1258
01:14:41,970 --> 01:14:43,890
Sorry for the lack of punctuation.

1259
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:49,520
We'll use parenthesis when he said that
I flew this girl out all the way to

1260
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:52,890
Japan's, you know something. Fuck
you. I'm not reading this shit.

1261
01:14:54,450 --> 01:14:56,980
You, I this, you know what?
You rewrite this fucking thing.

1262
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:02,330
You rewrite this fucking thing. Okay.
And then I'll read it. Go Fuck Yourself.

1263
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:05,480
Sorry for the lack of punctuation.
Yes. Sorry. And I fucking rignet.

1264
01:15:05,930 --> 01:15:08,780
There you go. I draw the
line at lack of punctuation.

1265
01:15:10,290 --> 01:15:13,590
I hate when people fucking
go. Sorry if you, sorry.

1266
01:15:13,591 --> 01:15:15,840
You would have taken the time
to, to put some shit in there.

1267
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:19,580
You didn't, you're not sorry.
You fucking lazy. So fuck off.

1268
01:15:19,610 --> 01:15:22,100
Now I'm going to be lazy right back to
you. I'm not reading you Goddamn Shit.

1269
01:15:22,101 --> 01:15:24,410
However, if you want to fix it,

1270
01:15:25,330 --> 01:15:28,750
put some punctuation in it and I will
read it. God Damn it, Al read it.

1271
01:15:28,810 --> 01:15:30,700
All right. The Red Sox,

1272
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:36,180
we're in second place in the evil
empire Yankees are in first place.

1273
01:15:36,181 --> 01:15:40,200
Those evil motherfuckers with all their
home grown talent. And here we are,

1274
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:45,150
the young upstarts with a $215 million
team just doing anything we can

1275
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:49,940
to try to keep up with
them. Um, I want to know,

1276
01:15:49,970 --> 01:15:52,400
I want to fucking know, cause I
heard he lost a bunch of weight.

1277
01:15:52,401 --> 01:15:54,080
I know he ended up getting
fucking hurt again.

1278
01:15:54,350 --> 01:15:57,470
I want to know when Pablo is
coming back. I don't know why.

1279
01:15:57,650 --> 01:16:00,560
I just feel like he's have gonna have
a great second half of the season.

1280
01:16:01,190 --> 01:16:04,670
Pablo Sandovall and he's going
to earn his goddamn money.

1281
01:16:05,450 --> 01:16:06,610
And I think the red sox I get,

1282
01:16:06,740 --> 01:16:09,570
they're going to catch fire here right
before the all star break and they,

1283
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:12,410
and it's going to be Yankees,
red sox, Yankees, red sox,

1284
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:14,720
and it's going to be great again.
It's going to be fucking hilarious.

1285
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:17,570
Cause now we're the fucking
evil empire that could

1286
01:16:19,830 --> 01:16:24,230
spend 200 fucking million
dollars. Um, that's my prediction.

1287
01:16:25,220 --> 01:16:28,940
It's going to go down to them and, um,

1288
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:35,000
ESPN will blow the Yankees because they
have homegrown talent and they will

1289
01:16:35,941 --> 01:16:38,940
fucking trash the red sox for
spending all this fucking money.

1290
01:16:38,941 --> 01:16:42,570
Like they never trashed the Yankees
when they did it back in the day because

1291
01:16:42,571 --> 01:16:45,300
that's how it works. Because when
the Yankees win the world series,

1292
01:16:45,301 --> 01:16:50,190
ESPN goes in, all is right in the
baseball universe. It's just like, oh,

1293
01:16:50,191 --> 01:16:51,560
so you guys are all Yankee fans there.

1294
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:53,400
Why does it make it right?

1295
01:16:57,030 --> 01:16:59,610
I never understood that, that
they play favorites like that,

1296
01:16:59,611 --> 01:17:03,990
but I guess that's what they do. So
you know what? Fuck them. Fuck you too.

1297
01:17:04,590 --> 01:17:07,440
Have a great couple of days.
I'll check in on you on Thursday.

1298
01:17:07,441 --> 01:17:08,820
Be careful around those grills you have.
