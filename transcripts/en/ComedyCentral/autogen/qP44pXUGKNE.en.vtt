I wrote it, I sent it, I'm ****d

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:12.411
- So a couple years
ago, I am hanging out

00:00:12.411 --> 00:00:13.679
with a good friend of mine.

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:14.781
I don't want to
use his real name,

00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:16.883
so let's just call him...

00:00:18.417 --> 00:00:19.585
Taheen.

00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:21.520
So Taheen and I are hanging out,

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.356
and we decide to (clicks tongue)

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:25.124
you know, light up,
smoke a little J.

00:00:25.124 --> 00:00:27.360
(inhaling)

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:32.298
Then Taheen starts getting
a little bit paranoid.

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:34.300
I find this so annoying.

00:00:35.735 --> 00:00:39.572
So I decide instead of just
telling Taheen the truth,

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:41.708
I'm gonna text my
best friend, Allie.

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:45.879
And I say, "S.O.S. Tah is
being so annoying, save me!"

00:00:47.313 --> 00:00:51.384
I press send and in the
background I hear a ding.

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:55.087
I turn around very
slowly and Taheen goes,

00:00:55.087 --> 00:00:56.489
"Is this a joke?"

00:00:57.423 --> 00:01:00.126 line:0%
Protip, don't smoke and text.

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:02.595
Additionally, try to limit
your (bleep) talking.
