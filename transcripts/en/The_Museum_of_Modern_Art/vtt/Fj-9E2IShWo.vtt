00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.240
So today I'm going to show you
how to stretch a large format canvas.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.260
This is a 40 by 40 set of stretcher bars,
and you'll notice that at this format,

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.380
I've added some cross bars here.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.210
The reason for that is to make sure
that the stretcher stays in plane and when

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.960
you apply pressure to it,
it doesn't torque.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.380
Where the corners would come forward
from the wall, and look rather stupid.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.700
I'm using cotton duck canvas here,
cutting a piece that's 46 by 46.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.110
So the stretcher is 40 by 40,
the canvas is 46 by 46, because it has to

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.730
account for the depth of
the stretcher bar, going over the side.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.640
And then I want to be having
a little bit of excess canvas here, on what

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.260
will be the back of the stretcher
where I'll be adding staples.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.860
So unlike the small canvas where
we stretch that work facedown, we're now going

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.860
to be
stretching work face up.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:58.560
So I'm going to slide the stretcher
just underneath the canvas.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.829
So the next thing that you want to do, just
like when working

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.320
with a small canvas, is to make sure that
the canvas is centered over

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.299
the support, over the stretcher here.

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.119
And it doesn't have to be perfect, but
make sure that you have roughly the same amount

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.020
of canvas hanging
over all of your edges.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.829
So the first thing that I'm
going to do is to add a staple now, upward

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:22.450
into the reverse
of the stretcher bar.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.140
[SOUND] And just as in the small
format canvas, the rule of thumb here, is

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.579
to always apply tension across
the center of the painting.

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:35.020
Another one I put one in there,
now I'm going to be pulling across.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.780
Now if you're really strong, and in
fact for this size canvas I really could do

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.119
this with my hands, but
certainly for a huge canvas, or if you don't

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.079
have a lot of hand strength you
can use a pair of stretcher bar pliers.

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:51.619
What's important to look
at here is the profile which has this little

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.420
flinch down at the bottom.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.069
That's the end that's going
to end up rotating down on the side of the

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:59.380
stretcher bar
to pull some additional canvas.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.439
Now if you do this,
there's nothing to rotate against.

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:05.139
So this is really the active
part of this tool here.

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:08.780
You're going to grab the canvas and then pull
it down using this

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.510
little flench to roll over.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.750
Another thing and
I'm going to just show you here.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.140
It's that sometimes if you just grab
the canvas and you're really pulling.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.640
Especially, let's say we have
a hundred-inch painting, something like that,

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.110
monumental size.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.120
You may worry about tearing the canvas.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.200
So, one thing you can do is
to fold that canvas over.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.140
And then grab it two-ply,
two thicknesses of canvas.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.360
Either way is fine.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.710
This is a very durable cotton duck,
so I'm not worried about that.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:45.200
But if you're stretching a fine linen or
something, then you may.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.430
So I'm grabbing the canvas, I have the
metal right against that stretcher bar.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.920
And you can see the tension,
that I'm applying as I pull this under.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.100
Now the trick is that you
want to keep that tension there.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.340
And then staple directly
behind that tension.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.680
So if you see what I've done here.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.060
I've added that staple, not on the
reverse, but on the end of the stretcher bar

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.710
and I pulled this under
tension before adding that staple.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.790
I'll do the same thing
now with the third side.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.140
So one thing you may be wondering is
how far to space these staples and there's

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.140
no golden rule for this.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.150
In fact, I just use the average
length of one of these canvas pliers.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.900
If I put a staple way too far out here,
I'm going to get what's called scalloping,

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.600
which are these rolling undulations of
the canvas that are going to be down edge

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.600
here.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.310
Which again, is going to make your
painting look rather poor quality.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.400
Well, how far is too far between staples?

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.040
It depends on the canvas,
it depends on the size of your painting.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.819
This is nice because now my staples are
going to be evenly spaced on the sides of

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:59.290
the canvas where they might
be visible to the viewer.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.850
If the staple doesn't go in all the way,
you can simply hammer it in.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:11.500
Okay, I've turned the canvas over now
to give myself some better access to these

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.500
corners.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.500
And the same principles apply as we
just explored in the small canvas video.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.319
In other words, I've stapled
completely two opposite edges.

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:26.320
Meanwhile, the other two edges, opposites,
I've left some space at the corner.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.979
In other words, I haven't put in that last
staple which is going to give me a little

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:35.060
bit of space to fold over that
canvas which is what I'll do now, we fold

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.470
this around
the wood with your thumb.

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:44.960
Pinch that canvas and
then fold it straight back over the top, give

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.620
us some tension.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.370
And then stay put in place for
a couple of staples.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.020
And again be sure not to staple over
that 45 degree minor join there that would

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.699
close your stretcher and
turn it into a strainer.

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:03.380
Really no need to do that.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.550
Okay, so
the canvas is nicely stretched now.

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.729
I do have a lot of baggy
extra canvas on the back.

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:14.310
So typically what artists will do is
just put a couple staples in to make sure

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.300
it's not going to fold back on
itself when you hang in on the wall or add

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.159
it into a frame or
something like that.

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:27.809
Alternatively what you could do is
stretch this again, put a staple in and then

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:31.419
remove the staples from the edges
which are no longer holding tension.

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:35.229
You would only do that if you
wanted to have clean edges and you didn't

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:37.430
want to look at
all this staples on the edge.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.210
In other words you could stretch
the tension on the edge, transfer the tension

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.249
on the back.

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:43.870
And then remove the staples from the edge.

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.719
I'm not going to do that,
these staples don't bother me.

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:56.509
So I'm simply going to pin down
This baggy canvas on the back.

00:05:56.509 --> 00:05:57.759
So all the staples are in.

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:01.999
Let's take a look and
see how we've done here.

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:04.110
Nice square canvas, everything looks good.

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.319
The edges,
nice evenly spaced staples here and now here

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:13.289
is the test, sounds nice.

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:14.870
This is the kind of tension that we want.

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.590
The canvas is nice and tight, so when we
are brushing on it, we are not going to push

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.430
it down and hit that wood because
we have some good tension here.

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.709
So large format 40 inch square canvas,
nicely stretched here.
