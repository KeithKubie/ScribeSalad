00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:02.041

Happy all up. Fuck weed, Dah Dah, Dah.

6
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.780
You're a fucking teen. It's, you're too fucking old for candy. Um,

7
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.400
what's the cutoff?

8
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.490
What's the cutoff tonight when the kids come where you just want to be with some

9
00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:32.520
of them just be like, dude, you're too fucking all cleo. Get outta here.

I'll feed you in a minute. Go on.

11
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.600
I'm telling you my cutoff is somewhere around like fucking 12

12
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.820
you know?

13
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.440
Even in around 10 they just start saying little wise ass cunty fucking things.

14
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.820
You know?

15
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.420
That's the hardest thing about being an adult around a kid is they think they're

16
00:00:51.421 --> 00:00:55.560
so fucking smart and it's just like Douche. I was, I was your age.

17
00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.510
I've been 10 I've been 12. Okay. Dad had been 2030,

18
00:01:00.511 --> 00:01:03.900

19
00:01:03.901 --> 00:01:08.610
I don't know what you're doing. Do you think you're playing with my mind? Man?

20
00:01:08.611 --> 00:01:12.450
I mean, just, we just want to say it too. Do you remember that? Your moment,

21
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.770
everybody's got to have that.

22
00:01:13.771 --> 00:01:17.580
Do you ever have that fucking adult that just fucking, you know,

23
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.900
when your parents weren't looking,

24
00:01:18.901 --> 00:01:20.820
just looked at you and just told you to shut the fuck up?

25
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.963
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

26
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.980
<v 0>Probably doesn't happen nowadays because of all this smart phones and</v>

27
00:01:30.981 --> 00:01:34.240
everybody's going to video camera and the kid blogs about it.

28
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.290
Next thing you know, you get arrested for run or,

29
00:01:36.291 --> 00:01:40.670
I dunno what I dunno about Cleo. Get out of here. Go on, go on. Um,

30
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.030
you know, but back then, I mean, that's the kind of Shit you could do.

31
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.570
I remember we were talking in church,

32
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.230
me and my brother and this dude fucking turned around and he goes, hey, he goes,

33
00:01:53.231 --> 00:01:54.064
shut up.

34
00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.270
<v 1>He</v>

35
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.190
<v 0>just said that. He goes, we shut up. You know, it's just one of those things,</v>

36
00:02:03.191 --> 00:02:03.461
you know,

37
00:02:03.461 --> 00:02:06.130
and my mother and I looked at my mother and she fucking put her eyebrows up

38
00:02:06.131 --> 00:02:10.940
like, but yeah, we'll shut the fuck up. That doesn't happen nowadays. Apparel,

39
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.430
all my you, you don't talk to know much emotional abuse,

40
00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.170
verbal abuse. No. Your kid needs to shut the fuck up.

41
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.880
So what, what our youth is,

42
00:02:21.881 --> 00:02:25.930
does that show that fucking hour where they just stop being cute?

43
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.610
You know, they just stopped being cute and they get fucking annoying.

44
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.600
And then a kid, it goes over the hill where it just becomes like,

45
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.921
you know,

46
00:02:35.921 --> 00:02:38.860
they're coming up to your thing and they got this shitty Grinch smirk on their

47
00:02:38.861 --> 00:02:42.650
face. I'm telling you this fucking year does fucking year.

48
00:02:42.651 --> 00:02:44.740
Some kid comes up with a smirk on his face. I go,

49
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.140
I'm not giving you any candy cause that look on your face.

50
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.360
This is what I want to say. But you can't because of that.

51
00:02:49.361 --> 00:02:52.690
Look on your face and if you do anything to my mailbox or anything like that,

52
00:02:52.691 --> 00:02:56.530
I'm going to fucking kill you. All right? You fucking pussy.

53
00:02:56.531 --> 00:03:00.240
You don't even have a drive yet. The fuck out of here. Right. But you can't say,

54
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.690
you know, he can't, not, not today's America, not today's America.

55
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.420
Or you know what? Trump's going to bring that back.

56
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.480
Um, I've had such a bad experience, like all my life, all my laugh,

57
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:19.160
I have a little bit bizarre been, I've been waiting for like,

58
00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.220
I couldn't wait to have a fucking house.

59
00:03:21.221 --> 00:03:24.640
The kids came by to go trick or treating.

60
00:03:24.641 --> 00:03:27.580
I mean I moved out and um,

61
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.110
well the first time I lived like in the upbeat attic of,

62
00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:35.340
of a fucking old house that they turned into an apartment.

63
00:03:35.341 --> 00:03:36.270
It was fucking hilarious.

64
00:03:36.271 --> 00:03:40.410
And you had to like walk down the center of the apartment so your head head

65
00:03:40.411 --> 00:03:43.770
wouldn't hit either side of the fucking roof. And uh,

66
00:03:43.771 --> 00:03:46.020
I told you guys this right now, he didn't have a bed.

67
00:03:46.021 --> 00:03:49.380
I slept in a sleeping bag and I would sleep right by the window because I

68
00:03:49.381 --> 00:03:50.880
didn't, we didn't have any AC.

69
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.210
And then one night there was like some torrential downpour.

70
00:03:54.211 --> 00:03:56.310
I was sitting the dream and I was on a boat or some,

71
00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.630
some about water and I woke up just soaking wet. Um,

72
00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.120
video is funny.

73
00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.770
Ended up catching a cold and like the next day it was like July was like 89

74
00:04:07.771 --> 00:04:11.670
degrees out of something. And I had a cold, like it was fucking November.

75
00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.530
Um, Oh God, that fucking sucked. Um,

76
00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.140
then I moved back in with my parents, got my shit together,

77
00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.170
fucking finally graduated fucking college.

78
00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.850
And then when I moved out I ended up going to New York City and people don't go

79
00:04:28.851 --> 00:04:30.290
trick or treating in New York City.

80
00:04:30.291 --> 00:04:33.860
They have places where they go where all the fucking candy is and they make sure

81
00:04:33.861 --> 00:04:36.680
there's no fucking Weirdos there. Um,

82
00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.240
and then when I finally moved out to La, I don't know,

83
00:04:41.241 --> 00:04:44.390
people still didn't come to my first department is when I got my house,

84
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.900
you know, five years ago they was just like, all right,

85
00:04:48.901 --> 00:04:51.900
now they're going to be coming. And I was fucking loaded for bear and I, you,

86
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.040
I did the bet on, I had the full size candy bars. Jesus Christ.

87
00:04:56.041 --> 00:05:00.660
Cleal you're driving me nuts. Get over there and lay down. You kick.

88
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.080
There's no way to be mad at a dog for longer than four. Frustrated. Well,

89
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.550
three seconds. [inaudible] can you please lay down? Hey Buddy, lay down down.

90
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.960
Go on, lay down. There you go.

91
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.260
And the follow through. Thank you. Um,

92
00:05:19.261 --> 00:05:21.690
I already can tell she's not going to sit there cause she's laying down,

93
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.570
but she has her ears up and she's just staring at me. You know what it is.

94
00:05:26.571 --> 00:05:29.630
I had to get up early to do this fucking podcast cause I got a bunch of shit

95
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.730
that I need to do. So anyways,

96
00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.940
people finally started coming to the fucking house. And uh, that's what I found.

97
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.500
You know, soon as the sun goes down the first, I know we always talk about this,

98
00:05:39.501 --> 00:05:41.840
but you gotta admit it's true. The first like hour and a half.

99
00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.490
It's the cutest fucking kids you've ever seen. The parents are great. Hey,

100
00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.590
you know, it's just like a great, it's just, I dunno, it's fucking awesome.

101
00:05:51.591 --> 00:05:54.280
The kids are adorable. And then somewhere around, I dunno,

102
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:59.240
two in seven and eight, it starts switching over and this just nothing but cons.

103
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.660
Like after like a quarter to nine, I mean,

104
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.780
just everybody see it's going to be a bunch of fucking,

105
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.840
oh man, you know something. What? Rent in this fucking house.

106
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.570
It's got this crazy driveway. I don't think anybody's going to come up here,

107
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.990
but next year I promise you guys I have to fucking,

108
00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.910
I want to open a door and be like, ah Nah, you guys, you're too old.

109
00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.720
You're too old. Look, he can go buy some candy. Get the fuck out of here.

110
00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.820
But then you gotta worry they're gonna fuck up your house.

111
00:06:32.821 --> 00:06:35.250
Even if they don't do it that night, they gonna do it another night.

112
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.530
Just be like, come on man, you guys are too old.

113
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.160
Maybe I'll just lie and be like, ah, sorry. I might've catty y'all taller.

114
00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:46.170
You five what? Yeah, I'm out of candy. What do you got?

115

121
00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:09.870
Oh my God. I Dunno about you guy.

122
00:07:09.871 --> 00:07:12.630
I don't know what grandmothers are like nowadays, but when I was a kid, man,

123
00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:17.070
my grandma, my grandparents had the worst fucking candy,

124
00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.790
at least one of them did. And then like the fuck,

125
00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:24.570
I had a paper route and then there was like a bunch of old bitties and shit that

126
00:07:24.571 --> 00:07:27.590
you know, coupled that never got married and shit or that damn fucking,

127
00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.420

128
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.350
They fucking husband died and they'd always have like this little candy.

129
00:07:31.351 --> 00:07:35.850
I have a piece of candy. Right. And I got a bite into, Ugh, God,

130
00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:40.590
I didn't know what the fuck it was. It was just, it was just horrible.

131
00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.620
Just, it just, you know, it was like,

132
00:07:43.621 --> 00:07:46.970

133
00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:51.690
I'm just saying it was disgusting. All right. So anyways, um,

134
00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:54.560
I'm actually going to a Halloween party tonight.

135
00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.350
I was going to make some pumpkin bread for the house, right? And I was like, uh,

144
00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:28.470

145
00:08:28.471 --> 00:08:29.460
Like who the fuck? What the fuck?

146
00:08:29.461 --> 00:08:33.900
You just be another asshole showing up with a bottle of wine as opposed to

147
00:08:33.901 --> 00:08:35.310
showing up with Pumpkin bread.

148
00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:37.740
<v 2>Okay.</v>

149
00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:42.570
<v 0>The fuck is, you know, I dunno. I don't know. Sometimes. Sometimes,</v>

150
00:08:42.571 --> 00:08:45.340
I don't know. Sometimes we don't fucking, we just don't see it.

151
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.460
Like I want to make my own steam dumplings. She goes,

152
00:08:47.461 --> 00:08:52.340
I just buy them at trader Joe's. You know,

153
00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:54.420
those are the, those are the times, you know what I mean?

154
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:58.590
Those are the times we just want to kind of smile and nod and just slowly back

155
00:08:58.591 --> 00:09:02.880
towards the front door, get in the car, and just never come back again. Yeah.

156
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:04.283
In other words,

157
00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:06.720
you'd lie to yourself that that's what you're going to do for the next 20

158
00:09:06.721 --> 00:09:09.750
minutes. As you drive around, you know, talking to yourself,

159
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.400
it fucking red lights and you look over, there's some beautiful woman,

160
00:09:14.401 --> 00:09:18.270
half your aides go and look at that crazy bald old guy and you just sit there

161
00:09:18.271 --> 00:09:20.550
and you gotta be like, wow, I'm the crazy bald old guy.

162
00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:26.080
No one's going to walk me out here.

163
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:30.710
And then you'd get you go back home and then that's it. That's how it works.

164
00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:34.010
But every once in awhile, not actually once in a while,

165
00:09:34.011 --> 00:09:36.560
more people than not can commit to that.

166
00:09:36.561 --> 00:09:40.460
They can back their way out the front door and they can go through with it.

167
00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:44.410
They take it all the way to the divorce, you know,

168
00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:49.360
they go out, they get themselves a toupee, you know,

169
00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:53.680
they painted orange, they get a red tie, they run for office,

170
00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.280
they start people up at truck stops. Um,

171
00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:04.310
this election is so fucked up that, uh, man,

172
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.270
that's got really quieted down. I have for the last fucking debate,

173
00:10:07.271 --> 00:10:09.820
if that's what the fuck you want to call it. Um,

174
00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:11.180
<v 1>okay.</v>

175
00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:14.930
<v 0>My big thing this year is I want to know, um,</v>

176
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.580
<v 1>okay.</v>

177
00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:21.260
<v 0>It's just fucking loose, loose. It's fucking lose loose at the, at the thing.</v>

178
00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:24.050
And you know, something, as much as I've been sitting here fucking saying,

179
00:10:24.051 --> 00:10:26.630
you know, Trump's a fucking racist and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

180
00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:30.950
It's just like, well, you know, the Clintons are from Arkansas, so, you know,

181
00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:39.010
I think that too fucking enlightened down there either, you know. Okay. Well,

182
00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:43.040
you know, I know I'm just fucking being stereotypical here, but give me a break.

183
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:47.720
Oh, Bill and fucking I, Hillary, they grew up in Arkansas in like the fifth.

184
00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:52.430
Okay. You might want to go back and look at some of those fucking racist,

185
00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.950
you know, the racist people screaming at black people,

186
00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:56.690
kids going to school for the first time.

187
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:59.540
You might want to try to pick her head out or something like that.

188
00:10:59.541 --> 00:11:01.910
Give me a fucking break. You're from Arkansas.

189
00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:04.550
I love that shit where just because you're a Democrat,

190
00:11:04.551 --> 00:11:07.850
that just means that you know that you're not homophobic,

191
00:11:07.851 --> 00:11:10.850
you're not racist or he, I have a buy wear blue,

192
00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.330
I just don't fucking, or that if you're a republican,

193
00:11:14.331 --> 00:11:16.220
then that automatically means that you, you know,

194
00:11:16.221 --> 00:11:19.310
you want to bury babies in the backyard, you know,

195
00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.980
unless they're fucking blue eyed white babies, you know what I mean?

196
00:11:21.981 --> 00:11:24.950
Like that whole fucking dinner in the corporations and all that,

197
00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:28.100
they're all fucking cuts, you know,

198
00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:31.190
I know that cause I'm a [inaudible] and I'm somewhere in the middle.

199
00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:35.660
I like to think I definitely lean more fucking left. But,

200
00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.680
uh, I'm also contrarion and now I live out here in Hollywood and I just can't

201
00:11:39.681 --> 00:11:44.570
fucking deal with these people out here. And, uh, that it's, it's driving me.

202
00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.080
I don't think it's driving me to the right, it's,

203
00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:51.380
it's driving me to say things on the right just to fuck with these people.

204
00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.500
Like I love trash and Hilary out here.

205
00:11:53.501 --> 00:11:55.180
It's one of my favorite fucking things to do.

206
00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:56.883
<v 1>Okay.</v>

207
00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:57.870
<v 0>You know, I,</v>

208
00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:00.270
last night I was fucking around the stage and I was talking about that.

209
00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:01.440
Let's talk about how, you know, well,

210
00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:04.770
Hillary's some fucking Arkansas everybody and they all kind of laughed. I go,

211
00:12:04.771 --> 00:12:08.490
you know, those those fucking fly overstates that you guys all shit on out here,

212
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:13.900
you know, and uh, you know, of course it gets fucking, I don't know,

213
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:14.211
whatever,

214
00:12:14.211 --> 00:12:17.180
you know what the big thing is on this ballot is wherever the fuck you live,

215
00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:18.680
more important than what,

216
00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:23.240
or that orange headed fucking racist comment or that devil woman with her

217
00:12:23.241 --> 00:12:24.980
fucking issues, right?

218
00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:29.750
She lived in Arkansas in the 1950s. Jesus Christ,

219
00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:34.310
write me a fucking break. Um,

220
00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:38.720
[inaudible] you know what the biggest fucking thing is? Sorry,

221
00:12:38.721 --> 00:12:41.660
I'm losing my train of thought here is those is all the props,

222
00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:46.190
the state propositions, you know, and this is what pisses me off.

223
00:12:46.191 --> 00:12:50.390
So I go to this website to try to figure out California 17 ballot measure

224
00:12:50.391 --> 00:12:51.890
propositions explained.

225
00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:54.630
<v 1>All right? And uh,</v>

226
00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:59.870
<v 0>all they do, they sort of explain the thing, but what they don't have,</v>

227
00:12:59.871 --> 00:13:04.871
what I cannot find is all the bullshit that is attached to each one of these

228
00:13:05.271 --> 00:13:06.051
propositions.

229
00:13:06.051 --> 00:13:11.051
Like this shit is so fucked up and I do not understand why this is never

230
00:13:13.061 --> 00:13:17.590
addressed. Why on all these propositions, like no means yes, yes means no.

231
00:13:17.591 --> 00:13:20.740
And then there's a little bit of maybe in there and then if you vote for the

232
00:13:20.741 --> 00:13:25.150
fucking Shit, there's some other measure saying that, you know, yeah,

233
00:13:25.151 --> 00:13:29.710
it's okay to a fucking stick, a baby in a snowbank for fucking, you know,

234
00:13:29.711 --> 00:13:32.040
13 hours until it freezes to death or whatever,

235
00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:36.360
however fucking long would would take, you know, I just can't,

236
00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:39.220
I can't find anything that says all the shit that's attached to it.

237
00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:43.480
Why can't the fucking ballot just be fucking the proposition?

238
00:13:43.481 --> 00:13:47.860
Just be written clearly. So regular people understand it. Yes. Means yes.

239
00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:50.950
No means no. And there's nothing else attached to it.

240
00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:56.270
You know, like they'll say, all right, ah, there we go.

241
00:13:56.271 --> 00:14:01.271
Proposition 51 allows the sales of 9 billion in bonds,

242
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:04.823
<v 1>um,</v>

243
00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:07.240
<v 0>to pay for, for new k, uh,</v>

244
00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:11.780
kindergarten to 12th grade and community college facilities.

245
00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:12.770
The basics,

246
00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.670
roughly 6 million students attend k two you don't have the fucking is

247
00:14:16.671 --> 00:14:21.530
proposition 51 wants to address the needs by allowing the sale of 9 billion in

248
00:14:21.531 --> 00:14:26.531
general obligation bonds to pay for buildings in modernizing K-12 and community

249
00:14:27.111 --> 00:14:31.610
college. It's the first school bond measure on the state ballot since 2006.

250
00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:35.060
It's unusual because it's sponsored by the building industry.

251
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:38.521
Okay. Right there.

252
00:14:38.521 --> 00:14:41.220
The fact that it's sponsored by the building industry means they're going to

253
00:14:41.221 --> 00:14:45.540
charge us up the fucking ass. And in the end, even though they get 9 billion,

254
00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:49.340
they're going to come in with the fucking tab of about 15 billion and then

255
00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:49.861
they'll be like, well,

256
00:14:49.861 --> 00:14:54.410
we already started good Spiegel physically moved from [inaudible] to Bluto.

257
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:59.710
Typically the legislator would be the path for getting this kind of proposition

258
00:14:59.931 --> 00:15:04.640
on the ballot, but it hasn't been able to do so in recent years. Yeah.

259
00:15:04.641 --> 00:15:06.470
The fact that the building industry wants to do it.

260
00:15:06.471 --> 00:15:07.970
You already know this is crooked, is shit.

261
00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:11.660
What you're voting on about 7 billion in nearly ADC. Like this shit.

262
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:15.290
7 billion would be allocated to the K to 12 thing, and then what?

263
00:15:15.291 --> 00:15:17.630
Another 2 billion would feed it for the community college.

264
00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:20.270
I got to read all of this shit.

265
00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:25.400
Supporters include developers, builders, school board officials,

266
00:15:25.401 --> 00:15:28.940
and business groups. I don't want to get any of those people.

267
00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:30.060
<v 2>Okay.</v>

268
00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:30.893
<v 0>All right.</v>

269
00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:32.483
<v 2>Cool.</v>

270
00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:33.690
<v 0>Supporters say, all right. Uh,</v>

271
00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:38.060
supporters say many of our schools need repairs and upgrades to make them save

272
00:15:38.061 --> 00:15:39.650
for our children. That's very vague.

273
00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:44.330
Proposition 51 we'll will improve education overall and help expand space to

274
00:15:44.331 --> 00:15:46.370
community colleges. Some more students can attend.

275
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:49.790
Opponents say prop 54 would add to the state debt,

276
00:15:49.791 --> 00:15:51.740
which is already more than 400 billion.

277
00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:54.170
How the fuck is California for an a billion in debt?

278
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.400
Bond measures should be passed locally.

279
00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:02.240
Giving communities control of how the money is spent.

280
00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:07.790
Yeah. Jesus. I mean, do you feel any closer?

281
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:13.650
All right, so there's one comment. Close the border.

282
00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:18.680
Eliminate anchor baby citizenship and re-institute and re-institute of all

283
00:16:19.361 --> 00:16:23.920
provisions of prop proposition one 87 then let's talk about building more

284
00:16:23.921 --> 00:16:26.860
schools. Sorry, I used to always vote yes on these.

285
00:16:26.861 --> 00:16:29.140
Now Sacramento has changed my vote.

286
00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:31.900
I always vote no on school bonds.

287
00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.800
Quid pro quo baby. What is a quid pro quo? Me?

288
00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:38.860
Where the fuck is it?

289
00:16:38.861 --> 00:16:43.861
Quid pro quo meaning I love that everybody else is dumb as me.

290
00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:49.630
A favor or advantage granted or expected in return for something.

291
00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:56.290
Oh, that doesn't get me any close to understanding it. Quid pro quo.

292
00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:59.380
Jesus fucking Christ. What it, what am I on law and order here.

293
00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.860
Quid pro quo means and explain an exchange of goods,

294
00:17:02.861 --> 00:17:07.861
goods and services where one transfer is contingent upon the other English

295
00:17:08.351 --> 00:17:11.980
speakers often is this tit for tat? Yeah, Jesus fucking Christ.

296
00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.900
English speakers often use the term to mean a favor for a favor.

297
00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:21.130
Phrases with similar means would include give and take tit for tat and you

298
00:17:21.131 --> 00:17:24.640
scratch my back. I'll scratch yours. Quid pro quo.

299
00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:28.510
I guess that's the fucking snooty way of saying that shit.

300
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:32.140
Let's go back to close the borders here so I can try to figure out what his

301
00:17:32.141 --> 00:17:36.880
fucking point is. Oh, I get it. Close the fucking borders and then I'll fucking,

302
00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:39.910
then I'll give money to this side. I see what the guy is saying.

303
00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:43.240
I don't know if it's right or not. All right. Fuck politics. All right.

304
00:17:43.241 --> 00:17:46.330
You know what I try. I fucking tried

305
00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:52.740
all freckles has not flipped out about technology and I figured out how to watch

306
00:17:52.741 --> 00:17:57.510
the NHL on my phone because so many in the room knew how to do it and they

307
00:17:57.511 --> 00:18:01.590
walked me through it and at one point I started to get upset cause I go,

308
00:18:01.591 --> 00:18:02.850
it's not going on. He goes,

309
00:18:02.851 --> 00:18:04.390
what do you mean it's not going and it's supposed to go on down.

310
00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:07.040
And I go and then I started getting mad. God, why would it go? Why? Why, why?

311
00:18:07.041 --> 00:18:09.170
Why would it go on? It's me if I fucking it.

312
00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:12.660
Just brought it down and bring it down. Bring it down. You know what I mean?

313
00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:16.260
Like you ever see somebody like revving up the engine ready to do a burnout?

314
00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:22.500
Then I brought it all the way down, you know, before the tire stop moving.

315
00:18:22.501 --> 00:18:25.920
And I realized that was not the tires I was actually burning out the clutch.

316
00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:29.100
It's one of the most disgusting things you'll ever see is somebody trying to do

317
00:18:29.101 --> 00:18:32.760
a fucking burnout. And I don't know what happens.

318
00:18:32.761 --> 00:18:34.920
I still don't quite understand. I've never done one.

319
00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:37.380
I just never wanted to beat the shit out of my car.

320
00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:39.510
I basically get it with the stick shift.

321
00:18:39.511 --> 00:18:42.780
I don't know how you do it with an automatic, I've watched fucking the videos,

322
00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:47.730
but it's basically you get your art premiums up, you let the clutch out,

323
00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:51.900
and then you stomp on the fucking brake so your tires are already fucking going.

324
00:18:51.901 --> 00:18:53.610
But somehow if you fucked that up,

325
00:18:53.611 --> 00:18:58.350
you let the clutch out and you're revenue engine and Yang. Jan, Jan,

326
00:18:58.351 --> 00:19:02.090
Jan, your tires aren't fucking moving and you burn out your clutch and it's,

327
00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:05.810
it's the, I don't know what that smells like, but the smoke is evil. Look at,

328
00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.230
um, all right, let's move on here. Oh,

329
00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:14.880
did anybody watch the Patriots game yesterday? Clear.

330
00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.990
Get over there and lay down every always in about you. Go on, go lay down,

331
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:20.470
go lay down. Um,

332
00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:27.380
I can't even fucking begin to tell you how much I enjoyed that.

333
00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:30.360
The fact that the fucking patriots beat the bills yesterday.

334
00:19:30.361 --> 00:19:35.361
I didn't say this because I take a puff beforehand because I take a nod.

335
00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:39.180
I get what bill Bellacheck does in his press conferences where he's like,

336
00:19:39.181 --> 00:19:42.300
I'm not going to say anything negative about anybody.

337
00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:45.660
I'm not going to give you any advantages because you fucking fat.

338
00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:49.440
Cons in the media are going to take this and give bulletin board material for

339
00:19:49.441 --> 00:19:51.120
the other team. I got to tell you,

340
00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:55.830
watching the fucking buffalo bills and we played them when we had a third string

341
00:19:55.831 --> 00:19:58.920
quarterback with a broken fucking hand or whatever the fuck was wrong with them.

342
00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:04.190
How they got in his face before the game was such a Bush League fucking move to

343
00:20:06.271 --> 00:20:10.110
the point like I've always liked buffalo. I might be done with that franchise.

344
00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:13.530
Like I used to give a shit. I, you know, they lost four in a row.

345
00:20:13.531 --> 00:20:18.000
Now I'm just like, you know what? Fuck them. You know,

346
00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:21.580
it's like you're that insecure that you're not going to win the fucking game,

347
00:20:21.581 --> 00:20:25.260
that you got to try to pull some shit like that. And I was just like that.

348
00:20:25.261 --> 00:20:28.360
Then I was just thinking, you're like, you know what? Two great things happen.

349
00:20:28.361 --> 00:20:28.991
We lost.

350
00:20:28.991 --> 00:20:32.080
So now we don't have to deal with the pressure of the fucking undefeated season.

351
00:20:32.081 --> 00:20:36.370
All of the extra media hype that comes if New England's going on defeated,

352
00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:40.990
if you fucking Indianapolis with old fucking a, what a fuck's his name there?

353
00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:45.970
Peyton Manning, you can be all the way to 13 and oh, nobody saying nothing man.

354
00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:50.590
They're right down the street. Them cows. Right. So he took that away.

355
00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:51.670
And then also I'm like,

356
00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.940
the Patriots are gonna beat the shit out of this fucking team the next time

357
00:20:54.941 --> 00:20:56.080
because of that bullshit.

358
00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:59.050
Because I know in house they must've talked about it and there you go.

359
00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:03.520
He gets 41 fucking points. Whatever the fuck we scored, I'm against you.

360
00:21:03.521 --> 00:21:04.420
Having said all that,

361
00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:08.020
I'd like to say a lot of positive things like tie Rod Taylors I can possible to

362
00:21:08.021 --> 00:21:08.860
fucking tackle.

363
00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:12.520
I know the bill's had a bunch of fucking injuries and I'd make those excuses,

364
00:21:12.521 --> 00:21:15.790
but they don't give a fuck those fucking animals.

365
00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:17.530
They don't give a shit.

366
00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.610
They were talking all kinds of trash to a third string quarterback like they

367
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:25.570
would coming out on the field getting ready to lose another fucking Superbowl.

368
00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:30.430
I love that. You fucking ringless. I love that you four and three. Hey Buffalo,

369
00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:33.400
we're on our way to the playoffs. See you next year.

370
00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:39.160
Fuckos Woo. Oh, I enjoyed that. I really fucking enjoyed that.

371
00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:44.200
You know fucking Rex Ryan told them to do it too. Oh God.

372
00:21:44.201 --> 00:21:45.340
I've been waiting to go off on this.

373
00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:49.180
You fucking get out there and you fucking fucking fucking fucking cause we the

374
00:21:49.181 --> 00:21:53.440
best fucking fucking in the fucking AC fucking east. Yeah,

375
00:21:53.441 --> 00:21:55.510
go have another fucking hero. Your tub of Shit.

376
00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:57.370
If you want to talk about cheating,

377
00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:01.160
you know we let a little air out of the ball. He got fucking that,

378
00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:06.390
that stomach gastric surgery. He's not phase of fat. Fuck. He cheated.

379
00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:09.250
Letting air out of the ball.

380
00:22:09.251 --> 00:22:11.590
He had a fucking choke out three quarters of his stomach.

381
00:22:11.591 --> 00:22:15.460
So you could actually see his dick every once in a while. Ah, sorry.

382
00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:21.250
Sorry. Anyways,

383
00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:24.870
um, yeah, I and,

384
00:22:24.871 --> 00:22:28.120
and I gotta tell you something else to fucking watching this world series.

385
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:29.950
I have gone back and forth,

386
00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:33.400
back and forth and back and forth about who the fuck I'm rooting for. I mean,

387
00:22:33.401 --> 00:22:33.911
how do you do it?

388
00:22:33.911 --> 00:22:38.860
One team's waiting fucking 70 not quite 70 years, right?

389
00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:43.570
68 years. Is that what it is yet? 68 years.

390
00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:47.620
The other team has even been the fucker world series is 71 years.

391
00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:50.170
And I know you guys think about bill, you're a fucking red sox fan.

392
00:22:50.171 --> 00:22:51.190
How can we not for the cubs?

393
00:22:51.191 --> 00:22:55.660
I was totally for the cubs until I saw the 30 for 30 on, on fucking Bartman.

394
00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:01.270
And when I watched it, all of their a hey, let's play to,

395
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:06.580
you know, hey, you know, where the lovable fucking losers, we always show up.

396
00:23:06.581 --> 00:23:07.570
We just root for him.

397
00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:10.720
All of that went out the window the way that they fucking what the,

398
00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:14.110
what they did to that kid. I just looked at that shit going like,

399
00:23:14.111 --> 00:23:18.700
that's exactly what would have happened if seven in Boston did that. New York,

400
00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:23.050
Philly, Cleveland, these cubs fans for all their fucking, you know,

401
00:23:23.051 --> 00:23:28.051
Mr. Smith goes to watch Washington fucking a apple pie and Chevrolet way that

402
00:23:28.781 --> 00:23:32.290
they did. They just like us. They're fucking animals.

403
00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:36.940
I'm not saying they're as bad as bills. Fans are, that fucking franchise.

404
00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:42.130
Those cons. At the time I was wearing a patriots hat. It was the bill's jets.

405
00:23:42.131 --> 00:23:43.270
I was rooting for the bills.

406
00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:47.540
I'm taking a piss in the bathroom and pushed me from behind while I was taking

407
00:23:47.541 --> 00:23:49.640
the piss. What kind of a fucking coward?

408
00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:53.240
Maybe there's a reason in the last four in a fucking row, you know,

409
00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:57.290
I used to think it was because of madly Levy.

410
00:23:57.530 --> 00:24:02.240
He was just too nice to win a fucking Superbowl and he went up against Jimmy

411
00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:06.320
Johnson. Let's get him some hookers and a corvette, right? Um,

412
00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:12.400
and fucking whatever that other guy's name is Jerry Jones with his real

413
00:24:12.531 --> 00:24:15.980
housewife fucking looking face. Good Lord.

414
00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:19.010
That guy always looks like, you know,

415
00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:23.990
he got like first degree burns on his face or maybe like slightly like into the

416
00:24:23.991 --> 00:24:25.850
second degrees, but he was like, all right,

417
00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:31.180
he refused medical treatment and he just put some savvy on his face. Um,

418
00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:35.240
I know I'm going hard this week. I don't know why. I have no idea why.

419
00:24:35.241 --> 00:24:36.230
I'll tell you why. You know why?

420
00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:39.410
Because last night I wanted to fucking come home and do my Goddamn podcast,

421
00:24:39.411 --> 00:24:44.090
but my wife, you know, wanting to watch a scary movie. So I said,

422
00:24:44.091 --> 00:24:47.900
okay, let's watch it. So we started watching that, but doka took,

423
00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:50.840
took whatever the fucking that thing is. And I got about like,

424
00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.750
I got about 40 minutes into that movie. It's like, honey,

425
00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:56.270
I don't want to watch the rest of this. All right.

426
00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:59.270
I hate watching scary movies because I, I buy in,

427
00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:02.900
I fucking buy in and I just like,

428
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:07.730
I don't want to watch this thing terrorizing this woman in the kid for the next

429
00:25:07.731 --> 00:25:08.800
fucking 90 guide.

430
00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:11.510
They are minutes cause I know neither one of them is going to die.

431
00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.850
And I'll eventually, they're going to figure out how to put,

432
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.120
put DACA took back into the fucking thing and then they're going to do something

433
00:25:17.121 --> 00:25:19.850
with the book that lets me know that there's going to be another one.

434
00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:21.260
Cause they're always, you know,

435
00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:25.760
fucking horror movies can never just fucking end. You know what I mean?

436
00:25:25.761 --> 00:25:30.560
Every one of them, they got to get greedy like Friday the 13th part fucking 97.

437
00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:35.990
You know what I mean? Nightmare on elm street. You know,

438
00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:39.020
they did like 20 of those hell raiser,

439
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:43.820
15 evil dead parts six. They just want to keep fucking going.

440
00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:48.800
And uh, I dunno, I just, I just don't like fucking sitting there being,

441
00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:52.130
having anxiety, you know.

442
00:25:52.131 --> 00:25:55.340
And with each scene they gradually gonna ramp it up the first time.

443
00:25:55.341 --> 00:25:58.970
Oh it's just a little bit of knocking and then there's a shadow and then,

444
00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:02.210
you know, I was just like, the sinks going to, I got a bad feeling.

445
00:26:02.211 --> 00:26:04.970
This thing's going to kill the dog and I don't want to fucking see that.

446
00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:07.970
All right. They already foreshadowed in the book that that's what's,

447
00:26:07.971 --> 00:26:09.560
what's going to happen. You know,

448
00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:13.550
they kind of showed you basically with the pop up book, fuck off.

449
00:26:13.551 --> 00:26:16.280
If you think I'm ruining this, it's, this is like paint by numbers.

450
00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:20.030
Every fucking one of them. I get an upset because I just hate, so I was like,

451
00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:21.410
I don't want to watch the rest of this.

452
00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:26.410
So she ends up shutting it off and then she's like fucking pissed.

453
00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:31.940
She's like fucking pissed at me. And it's just like, I like Westworld.

454
00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:33.650
My wife doesn't give a fuck about Westworld.

455
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.530
I'm still on episode two because every night I want to fucking watch it.

456
00:26:36.531 --> 00:26:41.510
She's like, Eh, I wanna watch the real housewives of fucking

457
00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:45.660
St Louis or whatever the fuck it is. So anyways,

458
00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:50.550
let me get back to the cubs thing. So right out of the gate,

459
00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:55.560
not only is the country, it seems for the, for the Chicago cubs,

460
00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:59.170
it's kind of having this vibe of this foregone conclusion that they're Kinda

461
00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:00.213
gonna win this thing.

462
00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:05.760
So I have family or I had family back in the day out in Ohio.

463
00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:10.440
My grandmother worked for the Cleveland Press, you know, and, um,

464
00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:14.490
way back in the day I had family, you know, I just had family about their right.

465
00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:18.720
And so growing up I kinda was, you know,

466
00:27:18.721 --> 00:27:23.490
I was always a red sox fan, but, uh, you know,

467
00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:27.750
I Kinda, you know, through my relatives also kind of rooted for the Indians.

468
00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:30.180
You know what I mean? Like, I didn't, I didn't mind the Indians,

469
00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:33.420
even though they were in our division way back in the day, um,

470
00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:37.110
that the tigers, you know what I mean, just cause of relatives,

471
00:27:37.111 --> 00:27:40.380
cousins and all that shit. So I was just like, you know,

472
00:27:40.381 --> 00:27:43.710
I kinda liked the fucking Indians and you know, that Steve Bartman Shit,

473
00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:45.090
like the level that they took that to,

474
00:27:45.091 --> 00:27:47.910
that's exactly what would have happened in Philly and all this shit.

475
00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:51.420
And if it happened out in la, that poor kid would've got killed.

476
00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:53.101
You know what I mean?

477
00:27:53.101 --> 00:27:58.101
Or San Diego or Sacramento or Fresno or one of these fucking lunatic fucking

478
00:27:58.741 --> 00:28:02.850
cities out here where they take sports Oakland way too seriously.

479
00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:07.620
San Francisco, you know. Um,

480
00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:12.480
so made me just kind of fucking sort of pull back.

481
00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:17.610
And then also it's like I, you know what,

482
00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:21.690
I'm kind of over these fucking cities that have two professional teams in one

483
00:28:21.691 --> 00:28:26.190
sport. It's like Chicago won a world series.

484
00:28:26.191 --> 00:28:29.970
They won it in 2005 and that whole fucking thing where it's like,

485
00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:33.540
well that was just, there was for the south side of the city.

486
00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:36.720
So what you need another one for the north side?

487
00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:42.450
Fuck the white sox and the cubs. This shit, if she, one of them wins,

488
00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:47.460
just fucking jump on a subway or walk three blocks downtown or uptown and join

489
00:28:47.461 --> 00:28:51.360
the fucking parade already. Same thing with the Yankees and the mets,

490
00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:56.670
the Lakers and the clippers and everything in fucking New York giants, jets,

491
00:28:56.671 --> 00:29:01.260
Yankees meds, fucking rangers, islanders, Knicks and nets.

492
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:04.470
Just fuck off with that shit already. It's a New York team.

493
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:09.580
If they win by your championship hat and go down there and just be happy that sh

494
00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:12.810
especially in New York, that you're so fucking filthy, stinking,

495
00:29:12.811 --> 00:29:17.010
fucking rich that you can have eight teams where everybody else is doing,

496
00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:22.050
doing backflips that they just have one in every sport. You know?

497
00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:23.341
I know.

498
00:29:23.341 --> 00:29:25.920
Isn't it amazing that New York has all those fucking teams and they don't win

499
00:29:25.921 --> 00:29:30.190
that much? You think that Jesus Christ, you got eight,

500
00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:35.040
eight at bats every fucking year. The fucking Yankees,

501
00:29:35.041 --> 00:29:39.990
I swear to God, are like the sugar daddy of New York City. You know what I mean?

502
00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:44.530
The giants are the favorite son and everybody else is getting read written out

503
00:29:44.531 --> 00:29:48.250
of the will. That's basically how it works with the sports in New York.

504
00:29:48.251 --> 00:29:50.830
Do you know what New York should get three teams in every fucking city?

505
00:29:50.831 --> 00:29:55.180
Maybe they could fucking do something other than the Yankees and the giants.

506
00:29:55.181 --> 00:29:57.310
I have totally fucking respect for them, but Jesus Christ,

507
00:29:57.311 --> 00:30:00.700
the fucking necks should combine with the nets. You know,

508
00:30:00.701 --> 00:30:03.460
make like a fucking dream team of those two shit shows.

509
00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:08.200
Same thing with the ranges in the islanders. You know,

510
00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:10.690
I don't know the jets and the mets, I don't know what they should do.

511
00:30:10.691 --> 00:30:14.300
They should both retire and they should start playing bad man. Um,

512
00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:16.380
oh Jesus Bell. Um, so anyways,

513
00:30:16.381 --> 00:30:21.250
so I'm really fucking sitting there and I'm and love and seen Terry Francona

514
00:30:21.251 --> 00:30:24.910
killing it and it gets all the way up to three games to one.

515
00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:27.180
<v 1>All right.</v>

516
00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:32.550
<v 0>And I don't know, something happened. Okay. My Cleveland friends,</v>

517
00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:35.820
Comedians, one of them in particular just starts,

518
00:30:35.821 --> 00:30:39.790
he's just talking all this shit and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

519
00:30:39.791 --> 00:30:41.890
And he starts to got, we were in the basketball,

520
00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:44.590
now we're going to win the baseball, the, you know, you watch,

521
00:30:44.591 --> 00:30:48.310
we're going on a fucking run. You Yadda with no fucking respect.

522
00:30:48.311 --> 00:30:51.820
And he's talking to a fan from Boston, you know what I mean? It's just like,

523
00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:54.310
are you going to win two in one fucking year? Yeah, we did that.

524
00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:57.830
We did that a couple of times and then we went every fucking do.

525
00:30:57.831 --> 00:31:02.220
We did all of this other shit. I'm not fucking throwing that in your face.

526
00:31:03.050 --> 00:31:08.030
I'm always the guy going like add an aloe, say Dah. The team's tough.

527
00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:11.690
I never believe we're going to do it until we do it. And then we do that.

528
00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:13.940
I'm fucking psych and you can go back to my podcast.

529
00:31:13.941 --> 00:31:16.480
I wasn't even a conduit beat Seattle.

530
00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:22.600
So these guys are acting like such fucking cons. You know what I mean?

531
00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:27.070
Oh, we got Lebron. We're going to fucking do it again this year. Oh, the Brown.

532
00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:30.220
Oh you mean the guy that you guys are burned his Jersey and you're all done with

533
00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.490
first. He called that one all Paul verse,

534
00:31:33.491 --> 00:31:38.491
he called that one Paul Versey fucking when he was in Miami and these Cleveland

535
00:31:39.341 --> 00:31:42.790
fans were saying, fuck that guy, blah blah, blah, blah. First he said to him,

536
00:31:42.791 --> 00:31:46.450
you guys are all going to be sucking his dick when he comes back to town.

537
00:31:46.451 --> 00:31:50.110
And they were like, no way. That's never going to happen while it's happening.

538
00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.930
That whole city's on their fucking knees.

539
00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:56.590
So anyways,

540
00:31:57.790 --> 00:32:02.680
so at some point after they went up three games to one, I went back to the cubs.

541
00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:03.873
The reality is,

542
00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:07.030
is I don't give a shit who wins this fucking thing because it's going to be

543
00:32:07.031 --> 00:32:11.740
great for one city. It's going to be devastating for the other city.

544
00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:16.540
Um, obviously, but so here's the deal.

545
00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:20.290
This is what's at stake with this world series. If the cubs win,

546
00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:23.020
the Indians become the cubs.

547
00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:27.010
They become the ones that have gone the fucking longest. All right?

548
00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:31.480
So they can't fucking lose. All right? If Cleveland wins,

549
00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:35.610
all right? Not only the cubs, still the cubs,

550
00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:41.150
as far as my quick research research showed me the next people in line for

551
00:32:41.331 --> 00:32:46.331
second place would be the cult 45 slash Houston Astros that started in 1962 in

552
00:32:51.501 --> 00:32:52.970
1962,

553
00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:59.080
the Chicago cubs were already 54 years into their drought.

554
00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:02.813
Okay.

555
00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:07.890
1962 is 54 years for where the fuck we are right now.

556
00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:10.600
Right?

557
00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:15.600
So the Astros are 54 years into their drought where the cubs were in 1962 and

558
00:33:15.851 --> 00:33:18.490
the cubs are now twice that at one oh eight.

559
00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:20.200
I don't know what the fuck that means.

560
00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:23.800
Does that mean that you should go play the lottery right now?

561
00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:28.240
54 62 one zero eight.

562
00:33:28.241 --> 00:33:31.060
I have no idea what that fucking means. It's just, you know, one of those,

563
00:33:31.061 --> 00:33:33.320
one of those number things. Um,

564
00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:35.380
<v 1>okay.</v>

565
00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:36.780
<v 0>But I gotta tell you, uh,</v>

566
00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:40.530
it's almost fitting that if the cubs are gonna win it,

567
00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:46.040
that they would torture their fucking fans to this level and it's fitting that

568
00:33:46.291 --> 00:33:47.820
if the Indians were going to lose it,

569
00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:52.140
they would go up three to one to lift their fucking team's hopes.

570
00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:54.750
This is why I think the cubs are gonna win.

571
00:33:55.470 --> 00:34:00.030
If Terry Francona wasn't in that Dugout, the master, by the way, he, he needs,

572
00:34:00.031 --> 00:34:03.990
that guy needs a, a nickname like the assassin.

573
00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:08.940
He needs like a boxer nickname. Like remember lights out James Tony,

574
00:34:10.290 --> 00:34:11.123
you know,

575
00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:15.570
or the execution or Bernard Hopkins that he needs a name like that.

576
00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:19.740
It's just said he doesn't look like that. But that's exactly what that guy is.

577
00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:23.100
All right. What I'm saying is

578
00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:27.770
because of what these teams had done to their fans,

579
00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:32.720
it would be fitting that the fucking cubs wouldn't just go in and win the

580
00:34:32.721 --> 00:34:37.190
fucking thing. So their fans could just relax and finally enjoy your series.

581
00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:40.040
They would have to go down three to one before they'd come back.

582
00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:42.650
And then Cleveland couldn't just lose the series.

583
00:34:42.651 --> 00:34:44.570
They'd have to go up three games to one.

584
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:48.920
So this is what's crazy about three gear up, three games to one. You're like,

585
00:34:48.921 --> 00:34:49.820
holy fuck,

586
00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:53.990
you're starting to take the wire off the champagne bottle at that point, right?

587
00:34:55.550 --> 00:35:00.200
But then all of a sudden you fucking lose game five and just instantly,

588
00:35:00.201 --> 00:35:03.230
it's like, holy fuck, if we lose the next one, it's all tied up.

589
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:06.740
So now the pressure is on the Indians. I'll tell you,

590
00:35:06.741 --> 00:35:08.810
the cubs are going in there. They're playing loose.

591
00:35:08.811 --> 00:35:12.770
They got nothing to lose other than fucking 108 year drought.

592
00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:18.050
I don't know who's on the mound. I don't know what. But, um,

593
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:23.300
I'm going to say the obvious. The cubs gotta go.

594
00:35:23.301 --> 00:35:28.301
They gotta they gotta score early and make the fucking Indians tighten up.

595
00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:32.570
That's what the fuck they got to do. Or uh,

596
00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:34.850
that's what's going to happen at game six.

597
00:35:34.851 --> 00:35:39.300
Either the cubs are gonna score early. Indians fucking tighten up. Yeah.

598
00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:42.300
And then lose the game and then we get a game seven.

599
00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:45.660
Or if the Indians go up early, it's going to be a bloody Beth.

600
00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:48.900
It's gotta be a shit show. Um,

601
00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:53.610
I'm hoping the first thing happens because I want to see,

602
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:59.390
I want to see a game seven against a team that hasn't won an 108 years and a

603
00:35:59.461 --> 00:36:04.400
team that hasn't won it and fucking, uh, what does it, 68 fucking years? 68.

604
00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:07.620
It's adorable to a red sox fan. That's fucking hilarious. I mean, I give a fuck.

605
00:36:07.621 --> 00:36:10.080
That's like this. Whether we were there in like the 70s, right?

606
00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:14.610
What was 68 for us? I was at the mets, let's see.

607
00:36:14.611 --> 00:36:19.530
1918 to 1978. That's 60 years,

608
00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:25.560
right? And I 86.

609
00:36:25.561 --> 00:36:29.100
I was 1986. So you just did bill Buckner. Go fuck yourselves.

610
00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:31.043
You know,

611
00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:35.350
you just did tell bacter as far as where I'm coming from,

612
00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:40.180
you got to go another fucking a another 18 years to 2004,

613
00:36:40.930 --> 00:36:44.350
so I guess I won't root for the Indians. I can, I fucking, I don't know.

614
00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:47.650
My relatives got me into the Indians. I don't know what to do.

615
00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:50.960
I don't know who to root for here. You know,

616
00:36:50.961 --> 00:36:54.740
I'm root farm gluten for a game seven for game seven and then they're going to

617
00:36:54.741 --> 00:36:58.460
go up against each other and one team's finally gonna win that critical game

618
00:36:58.461 --> 00:37:00.170
seven and get the monkey off their back.

619
00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:04.250
And then another one is just going to add another giant cinder block right on

620
00:37:04.251 --> 00:37:06.680
the fucking heart to their fans. It's kind of, Oh God,

621
00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:09.620
this one has trained right re written all over it. All right,

622
00:37:09.621 --> 00:37:12.930
let me read a little bit of fucking average advertising, art, cheeses,

623
00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:17.210

so I can just totally chill out.

714
00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:38.890
I've been working out and eating like a fucking animal though. Yeah,

715
00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:41.980
I made this pumpkin bread and shit. You know,

716
00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:43.750
Rogan gave me some of that elk burger.

717
00:42:43.751 --> 00:42:46.810
I made it late last night and then had a slice of Pumpkin bread after it.

718
00:42:46.811 --> 00:42:50.470

00:43:30.441 --> 00:43:33.140
If you missed it. Um, once again,

733
00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:37.430
he has a new amazing standup special called triggered. Um,

734
00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:42.490
we talked about everything from hunting elk and wild fucking bore to,

735
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:48.110
uh, working out UFC shit, election stuff, stand up comedy.

736
00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:53.630
Um, just had a great fucking time. Um, but his specials on Netflix,

737
00:43:53.631 --> 00:43:57.500
so definitely check it out if you get a chance. And uh, all right,

738
00:43:57.501 --> 00:44:01.640
let's get back to 'em. Let's get back to the, uh,

739
00:44:01.641 --> 00:44:05.360
the podcast here. Oh, F one action and F one action.

740
00:44:05.361 --> 00:44:07.610
I totally missed the fucking race, but I read up on it.

741
00:44:07.611 --> 00:44:11.630
Lewis Hamilton wins again. For those of you sort of keeping score,

742
00:44:11.631 --> 00:44:15.830
now that I've been keeping score, um, you get 25 points.

743
00:44:15.831 --> 00:44:20.660
If you win 18 for second, 15 for third, that is 12, 10, eight,

744
00:44:20.661 --> 00:44:25.160
six, four, two, one. Right? That's the top pile. The top fucking 10 works. Um,

745
00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:27.380
Cleo, you could not be more adorable right now.

746
00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:32.200
What it is is she wants f o d I got up a little bit to do this podcast,

747
00:44:32.290 --> 00:44:35.100
so now she's come over. She sat down next to me,

748
00:44:35.101 --> 00:44:40.101
her ears are down and she's rested her head on my arm and she's just staring at

749
00:44:40.231 --> 00:44:42.510
me like, I don't know what's going on.

750
00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:44.403
<v 2>Okay.</v>

751
00:44:46.930 --> 00:44:51.720
<v 0>All right dude. I've got another 20 minutes. Just fucking relax. No, no, no,</v>

752
00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:54.750
no. Not coming up on the couch. Go on. Go lay down. Go lay down. Go lay down,

753
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:58.620
cleo. Get out of here please.

754
00:44:59.110 --> 00:44:59.943
<v 2>Okay.</v>

755
00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:05.360
<v 0>Jesus Christ. What the fuck again? It get out of here. Clio.</v>

756
00:45:05.361 --> 00:45:09.950
Get off of the couch. Way down. Oh, now she's needy.

757
00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:12.470
All right. Anyways,

758
00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:16.850
so Rosberg had a fucking league in the last two fucking races.

759
00:45:16.851 --> 00:45:18.020
Hamilton is one boat,

760
00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:22.610
so he's shaved 14 fucking points off of the lead.

761
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:25.850
All the fucking Nico had to do is fucking win one more race.

762
00:45:25.851 --> 00:45:29.180
I felt if he could have won it yesterday, he could have wrapped this thing up.

763
00:45:29.181 --> 00:45:33.200
I'm kind of glad that he didn't cause I want to see the person fucking wrap it

764
00:45:33.201 --> 00:45:37.610
up. Um, so the next race I believe is in Brazil,

765
00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:43.160
which is not until November 13th. And I apologize to, uh,

766
00:45:43.610 --> 00:45:47.270
F1 fans because I know I got into this shit and then I've just dropped the ball

767
00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:49.570
and like the last four or five ones, but I,

768
00:45:49.571 --> 00:45:53.830
I'm fucking living in this goddamn house. I fucked up. I forgot that,

769
00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:58.190
that it was this week and that I actually figured out through apple TV is some

770
00:45:58.191 --> 00:46:02.570
shit that I patiently worked my way through and actually figured out,

771
00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:07.370
um, that I could actually get a, was it NBC sports?

772
00:46:07.371 --> 00:46:08.450
Is that the name of the channel?

773
00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:11.090
And I could have watched the game of shit to watch the race.

774
00:46:11.091 --> 00:46:12.320
So I got to go home today.

775
00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:16.790
My house around the fucking corner taped that fucking thing.

776
00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:21.110
By the way, the kitchen is just come to a grinding fucking halt.

777
00:46:21.111 --> 00:46:21.711
I don't know why,

778
00:46:21.711 --> 00:46:24.060
but they're still telling us that they gonna Finish on fucking time.

779
00:46:24.061 --> 00:46:27.170
So whatever, whatever,

780
00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:31.040
I'm sure they will fucking sure they will. All right, let's get out of this.

781
00:46:31.041 --> 00:46:35.600
Let's, let's do some, uh, can I talk about now? Did you guys watch Clemson,

782
00:46:35.601 --> 00:46:40.400
Florida? Fucking amazing game. I also watched the, uh, limbs,

783
00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:43.610
Clemson, Florida, Florida state. Then I also watched, uh,

784
00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:47.270
Florida fucking Georgia. And you know, I was thinking when I first saw it,

785
00:46:47.271 --> 00:46:48.830
I was just like, man, I got to go to that game.

786
00:46:48.831 --> 00:46:50.360
I got to go to that game in Jacksonville,

787
00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:54.170
the biggest outdoor cocktail party in the world as they say. And I'm like,

788
00:46:54.171 --> 00:46:56.540
I bet the fans are cool with each other. They're fucking, you know,

789
00:46:56.541 --> 00:46:59.120
cause it's a neutral site, you know,

790
00:46:59.121 --> 00:47:02.000
everybody's just psyched to be away from their house. Sorry,

791
00:47:02.001 --> 00:47:05.720
I'm fucking you on here. Um, Georgia scores first,

792
00:47:05.721 --> 00:47:10.220
they cut to the Georgia fans in the stands and I clearly see this guy turned

793
00:47:10.221 --> 00:47:15.221
around not facing the field and just giving the finger to the Florida fans above

794
00:47:15.351 --> 00:47:19.310
them. And I'm just like, wow. All right. It's at that level. Okay.

795
00:47:19.370 --> 00:47:21.860
It's at dead fucking level. I D I, you know,

796
00:47:21.861 --> 00:47:24.260
I really had no interest in going to that game. I'd want,

797
00:47:24.261 --> 00:47:25.340
I want to go to this swamp.

798
00:47:25.550 --> 00:47:29.800
And I've been to what Georgia home game between the hedges and been to a

799
00:47:29.801 --> 00:47:33.760
Jacksonville verse, Bengals Games. So I felt like I'd been to that stadium,

800
00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:35.860
but after seeing it I was like, fuck way.

801
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.380
And it looks like fun and I always have a great time at Jacksonville.

802
00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:41.080
Everybody shits on Jacksonville. It's a good fucking time.

803
00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:45.130
If you take the stick out of your ass, um, you can go to a gun range,

804
00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:48.400
shoot guns with a, with a, with the fucking silence around. All right, clear.

805
00:47:48.401 --> 00:47:51.400
The only thing I'm going to do is just sit here and pet you as I do the rest of

806
00:47:51.401 --> 00:47:56.200
this. All right. All right, Westwood Dear Bill.

807
00:47:57.180 --> 00:48:00.880
Uh, glad you love Westworld. For some reason he wrote westward in the beginning.

808
00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:03.130
Glad you love Westworld. Uh,

809
00:48:03.131 --> 00:48:07.420
I look forward to hearing your thoughts and the rest of the season season. Um,

810
00:48:07.421 --> 00:48:10.150
if you like that and you're looking for a great movie to watch,

811
00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:12.040
check out the 13th floor.

812
00:48:12.310 --> 00:48:15.430
It came out in the late nineties and deals with similar themes.

813
00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:20.000
Are you into reading fan theories? A common one now, uh,

814
00:48:20.001 --> 00:48:22.570
that is a non spoiler is that Ed Harris,

815
00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:26.830
his character and the Nice guy who's new to the park or the same person.

816
00:48:27.090 --> 00:48:30.700
And other claims that it's actually all on Mars.

817
00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:35.620
Oh, for Westworld. Yeah. Well I gotta get caught up before people ruined shit.

818
00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:40.060
I'll definitely check out, uh, the 13th floor.

819
00:48:40.061 --> 00:48:43.090
And I think I'm going to watch an episode, episode three of Westworld,

820
00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:44.740
cause I think they're up to five at this point.

821
00:48:45.310 --> 00:48:48.340
I'm going to watch that today and I'm going to get caught up in, uh, you know,

822
00:48:48.341 --> 00:48:51.550
cause my wife fucking cheated on me with TV. You know what I mean?

823
00:48:51.551 --> 00:48:54.370
When you guys have your shows, right?

824
00:48:55.480 --> 00:49:00.190
We watched that show below deck with [inaudible] skin on there, right?

825
00:49:00.250 --> 00:49:01.240
And uh, it's just,

826
00:49:01.241 --> 00:49:04.810
it's a reality show that we can both watch because they're always in the fucking

827
00:49:04.811 --> 00:49:07.990
Mediterranean. They got a fucking yacht. It's the Shit we always think, ah,

828
00:49:07.991 --> 00:49:09.580
we should do that. It'd be fucking awesome.

829
00:49:09.581 --> 00:49:13.060
And then you look up the prices and it's like the price of a house to rent one

830
00:49:13.061 --> 00:49:14.170
of those fucking things.

831
00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:19.660
You gotta be like Beyonce and Jay z.

832
00:49:19.661 --> 00:49:23.050
Like both of you can sell out the rose bowl on any given fucking night.

833
00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:26.470
You know, you gotta be to that level of wealth to fucking justify.

834
00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:29.920
Do you realize the two of them are almost worth $1 billion?

835
00:49:30.130 --> 00:49:34.480
So for then the blow 250 grand and a fucking yet is like,

836
00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:39.550
let's just say you're worth $100 million if you're with $100 million,

837
00:49:39.551 --> 00:49:44.530
250 grand is like 0.25% of your money, right?

838
00:49:44.531 --> 00:49:47.320
Cause a million is like 1%. Right? So I don't know how to work that out.

839
00:49:47.350 --> 00:49:52.350
It's like 25% of 1% whatever the fuck that is of your money.

840
00:49:53.350 --> 00:49:58.100
And there were 10 times set so that that's like you and I, Hey,

841
00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:01.900
you want a yacht for a week and you take a penny out of your pocket and you

842
00:50:01.901 --> 00:50:05.560
break it into four fucking pieces and just hand it to them. Hey, you go,

843
00:50:06.850 --> 00:50:11.440
there you go. Yeah, we'd like, uh, all the amenities. Um,

844
00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:15.910
anyways, I will definitely be, uh, be checking that out.

845
00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:17.890
Ed Harris is like, as always,

846
00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:22.540
as always one of the greatest actors of all fucking time. Um,

847
00:50:23.650 --> 00:50:25.990
I'll watch anything that, that guy's in. I swear to God,

848
00:50:25.991 --> 00:50:30.430
the only thing I never saw is he was the one where, Oh God, Yo,

849
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:33.343
fuck,

850
00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:39.700
I'm the only one I never saw was the one when he played the painter and that got

851
00:50:39.801 --> 00:50:43.000
nominated or he got nominated for an Oscar. So I still haven't seen that one.

852
00:50:43.001 --> 00:50:44.780
So I gotta check that out. All right.

853
00:50:44.810 --> 00:50:48.410
Old Toys a dear Billy potato head.

854
00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:51.890
I love that. That's a good one.

855
00:50:52.070 --> 00:50:55.070
Cause that kind of shits on my Irish heritage and then also makes fun of the

856
00:50:55.071 --> 00:50:59.930
shape of my head. Um, if, if, if you ever have kids,

857
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:04.280
will you try and expose them to toys that you enjoyed as a child?

858
00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:07.160
You strike me as a matchbox car kid.

859
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:10.160
I don't force the toys of my childhood on my kids,

860
00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:14.960
but I've put a couple army men in their general area to give them a chance to

861
00:51:14.961 --> 00:51:18.020
play like I did. I am a huge, um,

862
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:23.660
agree or of that proponent of that opponent of that proponent. Oh,

863
00:51:23.661 --> 00:51:27.350
that's what proponent means. You're pro, right? I never knew what that meant.

864
00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:30.710
I just kind of figured that out. Oh, opponent proponent.

865
00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:36.440
Oh, pumpkin bread pro pumpkin bread. I get it. Um,

866
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:40.310
yeah, absolutely. I absolutely, uh,

867
00:51:41.210 --> 00:51:43.190
I absolutely will do that. Um,

868
00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:48.140
my big thing is playing catch and uh, you know,

869
00:51:49.070 --> 00:51:53.420
I'm going to buy a fucking, I'm going to buy a, a,

870
00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:58.520
a lefty glove for myself is what I'm going to do,

871
00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:01.520
cause I can throw a little bit with my left hand and rather than just sitting

872
00:52:01.521 --> 00:52:05.190
there firing it into my kid, I'd fucking, uh, I'm just gonna,

873
00:52:05.330 --> 00:52:07.700
I'm gonna go to the left hand. We were doing that yesterday.

874
00:52:07.701 --> 00:52:08.840
We had a football right.

875
00:52:09.890 --> 00:52:12.740
He's placed in at where rent here has his fucking great pool.

876
00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:16.550
So it was halftime of the Florida game and we're out there smoking cigars and

877
00:52:16.551 --> 00:52:19.520
shit. And we finished that up. We've got the game turned up loud.

878
00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:22.190
So the game became, there was four guys, right?

879
00:52:22.191 --> 00:52:25.070
So you had to on one side of the pool, two on the other side of the pool.

880
00:52:25.310 --> 00:52:27.260
So you had to throw with your opposite hand,

881
00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:31.520
first person that sent it into the pool or if he had a catchable ball and it

882
00:52:31.521 --> 00:52:35.720
fell into the pool was a, I dunno, whatever the fuck it was,

883
00:52:35.730 --> 00:52:37.310
was was that thing,

884
00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:41.450
that word you can't fucking say anymore cause everybody gets offended and it's

885
00:52:41.451 --> 00:52:45.160
not a racial slur, but it is, uh, you know, you know, you know the word. Um,

886
00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:51.080
nobody said it, but we all know we are, you know, without saying, yeah,

887
00:52:51.081 --> 00:52:55.370
we're all the guys. Like that's what it means. Um, so anyways, uh,

888
00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:58.220
yeah I would definitely do that was, I was not a matchbox car kid.

889
00:52:58.221 --> 00:53:00.350
I W I was Corgi cars.

890
00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:03.920
We used to call them core g cause we didn't know it was pronounced Corgi until

891
00:53:03.921 --> 00:53:04.581
we got older.

892
00:53:04.581 --> 00:53:08.210
And I'm so old that I remember when they had rubber wheels on them and I had the

893
00:53:08.211 --> 00:53:11.000
giant oil truck. I was big, I had all the race cars,

894
00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:12.830
I had the Johnny players' special,

895
00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:18.220
I had the Jackie Stewart Elf car and my mother doesn't throw shit.

896
00:53:18.351 --> 00:53:22.430
So I still have all of them. Um, I had one of those, you know,

897
00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:26.040
that kind of racing where the car just looks like a giant doorstop.

898
00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:31.620
Um, it wasn't Formula One, it wasn't, it's not indycar racing.

899
00:53:31.621 --> 00:53:34.590
It's not open wheel. You know what the car looks like,

900
00:53:34.591 --> 00:53:35.730
a water slide that you could,

901
00:53:35.731 --> 00:53:38.370
you could slide from the fin all the way down to the front.

902
00:53:38.370 --> 00:53:43.350
I don't know what kind I had a white and red, one of those, um,

903
00:53:43.410 --> 00:53:46.680
Lincoln logs, Lego, Lego blocks.

904
00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:51.810
Um, you know, stuff like that.

905
00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:55.960
I think it's big to not have to keep your kids, you know,

906
00:53:57.880 --> 00:53:58.360
I dunno the,

907
00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:02.390
you gotta get 'em outside and you gotta you got to keep them in their own. Like,

908
00:54:02.450 --> 00:54:07.330
I don't know. I have such a hatred of computers and iPads and all of that shit.

909
00:54:08.590 --> 00:54:13.300
Um, and kids just love them. I mean, they go up to it like, you know,

910
00:54:13.301 --> 00:54:17.110
liquid television type of shit. You know, back in the day, the MTV,

911
00:54:17.111 --> 00:54:20.020
I remember that graphic. I used to just make me want to sit down and watch it.

912
00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:25.600
Um, I dunno, Mr Potato Head, I don't know about that.

913
00:54:25.601 --> 00:54:29.980
Definitely like board games. I think it'd be fun playing cards.

914
00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:34.120
I think it's cool to expose your kids to that, you know,

915
00:54:34.121 --> 00:54:38.350
so they have like that old school shit. Like was it always the greatest cycle?

916
00:54:38.410 --> 00:54:42.430
Like for me, if I met a some woman,

917
00:54:42.431 --> 00:54:47.200
I took her out on a date and she had, she had some old school stuff about her,

918
00:54:48.010 --> 00:54:50.620
you know what I mean? That, that stuff that was sort of passed down.

919
00:54:51.010 --> 00:54:52.660
I think that's really like a cool thing.

920
00:54:52.690 --> 00:54:56.050
And I think a like some shit like playing cards,

921
00:54:56.530 --> 00:55:01.450
playing catch, like going outside, it's just like,

922
00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:06.610
you know, riding bicycles, just like all that shit is going away.

923
00:55:06.611 --> 00:55:10.840
And um, I'm not one of these old people that I look at young kids and be like,

924
00:55:10.841 --> 00:55:14.020
you know, what are they doing today? They're fucking nuts. And these kids today,

925
00:55:14.021 --> 00:55:16.970
they don't get it. And it's just like, um,

926
00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:22.140
I totally get why they're doing it because I had to tap out grand theft auto

927
00:55:23.470 --> 00:55:26.830
three in like 2003 or 2004 Id.

928
00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:30.850
I unplug my playstation and stick it in the back of the closet.

929
00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:36.070
I literally just one day, it was like the fifth day in a row,

930
00:55:36.071 --> 00:55:38.560
I was just playing all day long and I could not stop.

931
00:55:38.770 --> 00:55:41.950
I had already beat the game, I got the cheats, I did all of that shit.

932
00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:46.240
And then I was just going on rampages every night to shoot up to city.

933
00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:51.070
And um, I just,

934
00:55:52.750 --> 00:55:56.440
you know, I kinda just lost everything else in my life.

935
00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:01.810
I wasn't writing jokes and all that shit. So that was like 13 years ago.

936
00:56:01.811 --> 00:56:05.830
So I can't imagine how amazing the Games are.

937
00:56:06.790 --> 00:56:07.780
And um,

938
00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:12.510
like the virtual reality goggles and all of that shit,

939
00:56:12.511 --> 00:56:17.511
I can't even fucking imagine like how you get your kid to go in the backyard and

940
00:56:18.001 --> 00:56:22.020
just have a game of catch. Like to me that's the greatest fucking thing ever.

941
00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:26.020
I think it's a great way to communicate with your kid,

942
00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:28.180
you know what I mean? Cause you, it's like you're doing,

943
00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:32.650
that's another activity going on. So they're not really paying attention.

944
00:56:32.651 --> 00:56:34.600
You can praise them when they're doing well, you know,

945
00:56:34.601 --> 00:56:38.410
build up their confidence and then you just slide and how is it going at school?

946
00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:41.680
You know, and then you just read them fast. It's going great. All right,

947
00:56:41.681 --> 00:56:44.680
so it's going good. And VA, same kind of look down on, you know, it's all right.

948
00:56:44.970 --> 00:56:47.350
Oh, it's a matter of what's going on and they can kind of open up to you.

949
00:56:47.650 --> 00:56:50.020
I think it's like a great way to, uh,

950
00:56:51.070 --> 00:56:53.200
I think it's really important early on to be able to do that.

951
00:56:54.070 --> 00:56:58.480
To have your kid be able to come to you if they have a fucking problem is a,

952
00:56:58.481 --> 00:57:00.310
a is a huge thing. But um,

953
00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:06.670
how you sit there with a glove and a ball and a how that competes with putting

954
00:57:08.001 --> 00:57:12.200
on fucking reality glasses and you feel like you're going to fucking base jump

955
00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:14.960
off of a building or whatever the fuck they do.

956
00:57:14.961 --> 00:57:19.570
I don't know what the fuck they do with those six. Um, yeah, that's a, uh,

957
00:57:19.730 --> 00:57:23.690
that's, that's a difficult, that's a difficult one. I love Lincoln logs. I lie,

958
00:57:23.691 --> 00:57:26.270
I didn't like Lego blocks. He stepped on them and your bare feet,

959
00:57:26.271 --> 00:57:29.690
they fucking hurt at the Lincoln logs did. But like that plastic shit.

960
00:57:29.691 --> 00:57:33.440
I wasn't into that as much as a, the Lincoln logs are cool.

961
00:57:33.441 --> 00:57:37.970
We used to fucking build those things. We build houses and then we would,

962
00:57:38.210 --> 00:57:40.760
you know what they're Corgi Corgi car, Corgi cars,

963
00:57:40.940 --> 00:57:43.190
whatever the fuck are they called, drive them around.

964
00:57:43.330 --> 00:57:45.560
We'd have traffic jams and all of that type of shit.

965
00:57:45.770 --> 00:57:48.290
We had names for everybody that drove the cars.

966
00:57:49.470 --> 00:57:53.960
I remember I had all the fucking race cars in, in all my,

967
00:57:54.650 --> 00:57:55.101
uh, it's weird.

968
00:57:55.101 --> 00:57:58.430
They drove like a formula one car to work and then they drove the trucks.

969
00:57:58.700 --> 00:58:00.270
I had trucks and race and cars.

970
00:58:03.590 --> 00:58:05.960
Then my other brother, who's a total fucking gearhead,

971
00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:10.130
he actually liked like the real looking cars,

972
00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:13.700
like a Volkswagen bug, like a station wagon.

973
00:58:13.701 --> 00:58:18.060
Like he wanted to look like the cars that you could actually fucking drive. Um,

974
00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:22.250
I know my mother didn't throw all of those out. Jesus Christ. It's fucking nuts.

975
00:58:22.251 --> 00:58:25.130
They're all up in the attic somewhere. All right. Election Bill.

976
00:58:25.131 --> 00:58:28.010
The election is right around the corner. A couple of weeks ago. You,

977
00:58:28.011 --> 00:58:32.780
you'll eulogize the great barrier reef. Any last words for this election?

978
00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:33.861
Uh,

979
00:58:33.861 --> 00:58:38.600
not the country as a whole because I don't think it'll fall apart by an imagine.

980
00:58:38.601 --> 00:58:42.590
This has exposed the side of our country that we've been able to keep under

981
00:58:42.591 --> 00:58:43.700
wraps for awhile,

982
00:58:43.850 --> 00:58:47.960
which is that no one ever pays attention to anything unless it's an easy talking

983
00:58:47.961 --> 00:58:48.794
point. Yeah.

984
00:58:50.210 --> 00:58:50.830
<v 1>Um,</v>

985
00:58:50.830 --> 00:58:54.130
<v 0>not everything is more fucked up than we know or would like to admit.</v>

986
00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:57.220
What's the worst thing that will happen if either candidate wins?

987
00:58:58.960 --> 00:58:59.050
<v 1>Uh,</v>

988
00:58:59.050 --> 00:59:00.340
<v 0>well if Trump wins,</v>

989
00:59:00.341 --> 00:59:03.280
the worst thing is we're going to have to listen to all these European countries

990
00:59:03.281 --> 00:59:07.180
talk about how dumb Americans are, especially people in England.

991
00:59:07.181 --> 00:59:09.010
And I just want to say to them like, you know what,

992
00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:12.850
what if you threw out the person every 48 years?

993
00:59:12.851 --> 00:59:15.580
And I would love to see what the fuck you end up with. You know what I mean?

994
00:59:15.581 --> 00:59:19.810
Some years it's just not a good draft. That fucking, uh,

995
00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:24.770
whatever the fuck his name is. Tony Blair, that guy's been in this since Bush.

996
00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:26.810
Not even saying that guy's good,

997
00:59:26.811 --> 00:59:29.810
but you just get somebody in there and they just stay there until they die.

998
00:59:30.850 --> 00:59:35.120
Does the have like Margaret Thatcher's job. Oh, the original Hillary Clinton.

999
00:59:35.810 --> 00:59:38.020
Hillary Clinton can't even say her fucking name. Well,

1000
00:59:38.021 --> 00:59:40.490
what's the worst that will happen? Um,

1001
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:45.950
I don't know if Trump wasn't such a fucking jerk off if he wasn't such a jerk

1002
00:59:45.951 --> 00:59:47.600
off. It's really what the country needs.

1003
00:59:47.601 --> 00:59:51.410
You need somebody who isn't a part of the fucking system. You don't,

1004
00:59:51.411 --> 00:59:53.330
but you just can't have a guy like that in there.

1005
00:59:53.331 --> 00:59:57.410
And then Hillary is just going to be more of the fucking same.

1006
00:59:58.370 --> 01:00:01.190
It's just going to keep driving this country towards ruined.

1007
01:00:01.490 --> 01:00:03.860
Do none of them talked about the population problem?

1008
01:00:03.861 --> 01:00:06.530
None of them talked about the nationwide heroin epidemic.

1009
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:09.020
None of them talked about genetically altered food.

1010
01:00:09.170 --> 01:00:11.960
None of them talked about fucking global warming.

1011
01:00:12.110 --> 01:00:15.500
Maybe they touched on it for a second. They haven't said Shit.

1012
01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:16.700
They're not going to do anything.

1013
01:00:16.701 --> 01:00:19.760
None of them going to try to stop the banks put them in fucking line.

1014
01:00:20.090 --> 01:00:21.720
That building another real estate bubble. I'll tell you,

1015
01:00:21.850 --> 01:00:25.700
it's fucking hilarious out here is they are building up la like I've never

1016
01:00:25.701 --> 01:00:26.534
fucking seen.

1017
01:00:27.350 --> 01:00:31.670
They bought up the house of Blues right across the street from the fucking, um,

1018
01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:35.480
from the fucking uh, uh, comedy store.

1019
01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:38.840
They play like $28 million for the thing. They're going to put these,

1020
01:00:38.841 --> 01:00:43.250
these high rise fucking million multimillion dollar fucking condos in there.

1021
01:00:43.251 --> 01:00:46.460
It's like, who the Fuck gonna Afford to buy those things? All right.

1022
01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:50.510
And this is the thing, after 2008, after we saw what happened,

1023
01:00:51.590 --> 01:00:54.170
they fucking gave the house. None of the bankers went to jail.

1024
01:00:54.171 --> 01:00:56.600
They gave him the houses back so they could do it all over again.

1025
01:00:56.780 --> 01:00:58.610
They're building another fucking bubble.

1026
01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:04.040
And I'm already calling it right now by fucking 20, 21, 20, 22 or some shit,

1027
01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:07.580
there is going to be a bunch of empty fucking condo.

1028
01:01:07.581 --> 01:01:12.581
Fucking high rises going along the sunset strip and they have knocked down the

1029
01:01:12.831 --> 01:01:16.340
rainbow room, the Roxy, the wix whisky, house of Blues,

1030
01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:20.630
maybe the comedy store, they're gonna wipe out all of these fucking things.

1031
01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:22.700
There's going to be nobody in those buildings.

1032
01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:24.560
And even if they are in those buildings,

1033
01:01:24.650 --> 01:01:27.860
they gonna have no fucking place to go cause they knocked down all the cool

1034
01:01:27.861 --> 01:01:31.670
places to hang out on sunset strip. It's so fucking stupid. You know,

1035
01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:36.590
I was getting gassed the other day and another place on the sunset strip and

1036
01:01:36.591 --> 01:01:38.870
this guy said, I say, yeah, you're on the gas station. He goes,

1037
01:01:38.871 --> 01:01:43.280
I wish I did this property just sold for 14 million bucks. And you know,

1038
01:01:43.281 --> 01:01:46.220
they're knocking down the two buildings next to it and they're going to put up a

1039
01:01:46.221 --> 01:01:50.420
fucking, you know, a 170 unit fucking, I dunno,

1040
01:01:51.110 --> 01:01:53.540
I just don't know where all these people are going to becoming.

1041
01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:57.770
That can afford to pay. I just don't know where they're going to come from.

1042
01:01:59.330 --> 01:02:00.590
Um, if what I heard, you know,

1043
01:02:01.070 --> 01:02:05.300
at least the ones on La Cienega that was like oil money, you know,

1044
01:02:05.301 --> 01:02:08.120
like Saudi Arabian money came in and they, they don't give a fuck. I mean,

1045
01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:13.070
they get money forever. Um, I dunno.

1046
01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:17.780
Uh, what's the worst thing that will happen if either candidate comes in is that

1047
01:02:17.781 --> 01:02:21.060
they're not going to stop what's already going on.

1048
01:02:21.090 --> 01:02:24.450
And I gotta be honest with you, I don't even think like, you know,

1049
01:02:24.451 --> 01:02:26.460
all the Bernie Sanders and all those types of people,

1050
01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:29.820
you would literally need an army of those people and then they would need

1051
01:02:29.821 --> 01:02:32.370
bulletproof vests to fucking,

1052
01:02:32.970 --> 01:02:34.860
that's how powerful corporations are.

1053
01:02:34.861 --> 01:02:36.660
And that's how off the fucking rails we are.

1054
01:02:38.090 --> 01:02:38.923
<v 1>Um,</v>

1055
01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:39.580
<v 0>I dunno,</v>

1056
01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:43.780
which is why I'm trying to focus on the propositions and I wish if anybody can

1057
01:02:43.781 --> 01:02:47.500
find a fucking website out there that not only lets me know what I'm voting for

1058
01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:49.690
but lets me know what is attached to it.

1059
01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:53.410
Like cause who doesn't want to improve the schools, you know.

1060
01:02:54.570 --> 01:02:55.403
<v 1>Um,</v>

1061
01:02:56.210 --> 01:02:58.520
<v 0>but you know, whenever they have stuff like that, like, hey,</v>

1062
01:02:58.521 --> 01:02:59.900
let's clean up the drinking water,

1063
01:03:00.170 --> 01:03:02.870
then they attach all this other evil shit underneath it.

1064
01:03:04.370 --> 01:03:05.600
<v 1>Um, I dunno.</v>

1065
01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:09.490
<v 0>I Dunno. It's, it's all very overwhelming.</v>

1066
01:03:09.491 --> 01:03:13.180
So it's so fucking overwhelming that you're asking extend up comedian,

1067
01:03:13.181 --> 01:03:16.750
what's going to happen or maybe you just did cause you want to hear me make a

1068
01:03:16.751 --> 01:03:20.590
fucking ass of myself. Um, all right, here we go. Cool guy.

1069
01:03:20.650 --> 01:03:21.940
Terrible in bed.

1070
01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:23.390
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1071
01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:28.010
<v 0>Oh Jesus. All right. Uh, dear Billy Bush bear.</v>

1072
01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:33.200
Uh, I'm a 20 year old female college student. Um,

1073
01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:35.210
I go to holy cross.

1074
01:03:37.970 --> 01:03:41.240
Oh, in, oh you said is I go to holy cross. Okay.

1075
01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:45.740
I go to holy cross in Worcester. Um,

1076
01:03:45.770 --> 01:03:49.460
I had a boyfriend for the first three years of college and now I'm single.

1077
01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:52.940
I hooked up with a guy that I didn't know was kind of an asshole.

1078
01:03:53.180 --> 01:03:56.240
He sort of popular and seemed friendly. One drunk at night.

1079
01:03:56.241 --> 01:04:01.040
I did the worst thing I could do, fed his ego. Um,

1080
01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:05.030
had I known he was a moron in a pompous Douche bag, I would not have done this.

1081
01:04:05.060 --> 01:04:07.400
I'll save you the reasons why he's a Douchebag,

1082
01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:12.580
but just picture lame eighties preppy bully who thinks he's God's gift.

1083
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:16.580
Again, I didn't know this because I had never paid attention to him.

1084
01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:18.590
Well after we hooked up,

1085
01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:23.620
he told some people that I told them he was the best fuck I ever had a this

1086
01:04:24.201 --> 01:04:28.040
found its way back to me and bill. I was shocked. Why?

1087
01:04:28.370 --> 01:04:31.550
Because he was the worst fuck I ever had. A,

1088
01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:36.230
he had no idea what he was doing. He was, for lack of better words,

1089
01:04:36.231 --> 01:04:39.860
not present. No rhythm and average at best.

1090
01:04:39.950 --> 01:04:43.460
I wasn't mad at this because it was my choice to hook up with him.

1091
01:04:43.790 --> 01:04:45.680
But now he's putting words in my mouth.

1092
01:04:45.710 --> 01:04:50.710
I really just want to tell someone how bad he was and wait for it to get back

1093
01:04:51.111 --> 01:04:55.700
around to him. What is my move here, Bill and or Nia? Well, wait a minute.

1094
01:04:56.030 --> 01:04:57.950
Did you say he was alright

1095
01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:03.900
one drunk at night? I did the worst thing I could do.

1096
01:05:04.410 --> 01:05:09.030
Feed his stupid ego. Does that mean that you slept with them?

1097
01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:16.210
I can't tell if you buy, feed his ego. You, you,

1098
01:05:17.410 --> 01:05:20.410
he was so bad. You felt like you had to say something nice.

1099
01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:24.430
Now there's no fucking way. You said there's no way. You said he was the best.

1100
01:05:24.431 --> 01:05:28.340
Fuck. Um, I think you're saying, yeah.

1101
01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:33.360
Yeah. I think you're saying that you, you fed his ego by hooking up with them.

1102
01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:35.940
Had I known he was a moron and a pompous dude. Okay,

1103
01:05:35.941 --> 01:05:37.980
so he's walking around saying that you said,

1104
01:05:39.150 --> 01:05:40.530
and you're also saying he's putting words in your mouth,

1105
01:05:40.531 --> 01:05:42.240
so I'm assuming that you never said that,

1106
01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:45.210
so fed his ego means that you fucking hooked up with them.

1107
01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:49.260
That's what I'm guessing. I don't fucking know. Christ they speaking radios.

1108
01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:55.370
Um, I wasn't mad at this because I'm,

1109
01:05:58.370 --> 01:06:02.790
well, oh, this is a tough one.

1110
01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:07.770
I would, I would call him up.

1111
01:06:09.570 --> 01:06:12.360
Then when he picked up, I'd be like, why are you walking around saying that?

1112
01:06:12.361 --> 01:06:17.220
I said you were the best fuck I ever had. I never said that. Okay.

1113
01:06:17.610 --> 01:06:20.100
I never said that. Okay.

1114
01:06:21.270 --> 01:06:25.060
And hear what he says and you know something. There might be a thing.

1115
01:06:25.061 --> 01:06:27.660
This is a thing, this fuck. A lot of these guys like this,

1116
01:06:27.661 --> 01:06:30.150
a tremendously insecure, maybe he knows.

1117
01:06:30.151 --> 01:06:31.830
He doesn't know what the fuck he's doing.

1118
01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:35.460
So he's walking around saying that so he can feel better about himself because

1119
01:06:35.461 --> 01:06:40.461
he feels that awful about himself and he feels so fucking awful about himself

1120
01:06:40.890 --> 01:06:43.140
that not only does he got to go that big,

1121
01:06:43.650 --> 01:06:48.650
that the fucking way he feels about himself is such a big thing that it does,

1122
01:06:51.250 --> 01:06:54.600
that he doesn't even think that that's going to get back to you or he doesn't

1123
01:06:54.601 --> 01:06:56.670
even consider your fucking feelings.

1124
01:06:57.120 --> 01:07:02.120
So you can either be the biggest person and know that this person is,

1125
01:07:03.090 --> 01:07:08.040
I'm tremendously insecure and walks around and probably doesn't like themselves,

1126
01:07:08.070 --> 01:07:12.630
which is a fucking horrible feeling to have and just take peace with that.

1127
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:14.510
<v 2>Or</v>

1128
01:07:16.790 --> 01:07:20.150
<v 0>you can call the guy out, which I kind of like,</v>

1129
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:22.870
<v 2>okay.</v>

1130
01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:26.960
<v 0>And, and I, you know, and at that point you gotta be, listen, uh,</v>

1131
01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.590
if you were the best fuck I ever had,

1132
01:07:28.591 --> 01:07:32.130
I would have said that to you and just leave it at that cause you haven't sold

1133
01:07:32.131 --> 01:07:36.870
him that he's completely fucking inept. You know what I mean?

1134
01:07:36.990 --> 01:07:40.710
But you're also kind of putting the guy in check. Um,

1135
01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:42.720
and then you have your final option,

1136
01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:48.620
which is you can go around saying that he wasn't the best fuck I ever had.

1137
01:07:51.690 --> 01:07:53.550
He's fucking terrible in bed. And then, you know,

1138
01:07:53.551 --> 01:07:56.610
what happens is everybody just gets to sit back and enjoy watching you guys

1139
01:07:56.611 --> 01:08:00.290
fucking do this shit. I understand why you'd want to do it.

1140
01:08:02.350 --> 01:08:03.060
<v 2>Um,</v>

1141
01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:04.740
<v 0>I dunno, I don't do the revenge thing.</v>

1142
01:08:05.730 --> 01:08:09.840
I kind of go to the person that's doing whatever they're doing that's fucking

1143
01:08:09.841 --> 01:08:14.640
annoying me and I just kind of chop the head off there and, uh,

1144
01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:18.770
and then if somebody comes up to me and says what they said, I would say a,

1145
01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:23.670
I would just say to him personally, yeah, that isn't true. I never said that.

1146
01:08:23.730 --> 01:08:27.000
I Dunno. I Dunno what the fuck to do. I'm sorry that this happened to you.

1147
01:08:28.770 --> 01:08:31.570
I'm at 20 years of age.

1148
01:08:31.571 --> 01:08:36.571
It's probably hard to understand a lot of this shit that I'm saying that of what

1149
01:08:36.611 --> 01:08:39.640
that guy feels about himself. But, um, you know,

1150
01:08:39.790 --> 01:08:42.160
you can't have somebody walking around saying shit like that about you.

1151
01:08:42.161 --> 01:08:46.850
So I would, first thing I would do, I would confront the guy,

1152
01:08:47.210 --> 01:08:50.450
call him up and be like, why are you saying that? I never said that,

1153
01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:56.750
you know? And, uh, if you continue to say that,

1154
01:08:56.751 --> 01:08:58.190
and if he kind of goes around to the loo,

1155
01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:01.280
if he continue to say that you're leaving me in a position here,

1156
01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:05.360
that I have to tell them the truth. Okay.

1157
01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:10.590
You're not the best fuck I ever had. All right. I Dunno. It's just,

1158
01:09:10.650 --> 01:09:13.470
I don't know that that's, you know, guys,

1159
01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:15.420
if you listen to this thing and you're a young person,

1160
01:09:15.421 --> 01:09:18.770
that's such an fucking asshole thing to do. All right?

1161
01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:23.810
That's totally coming from your own goddamn insecurity. All right? And, uh,

1162
01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:26.720
as an older, wiser fucking man, you know,

1163
01:09:26.721 --> 01:09:30.200
I wish that somebody older told me that when you hook up with somebody,

1164
01:09:30.201 --> 01:09:34.940
you keep your fucking mouth shut. Um, you know what I mean?

1165
01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:39.590
You're quiet about it. You know, it happened. Who gives a fuck?

1166
01:09:39.591 --> 01:09:43.560
Who knows? You know what I mean? That's, it's an insecure fucking move.

1167
01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:48.360
And just sit there and then she did this and it did dead. She fucking did this,

1168
01:09:48.361 --> 01:09:52.020
like that's a really fucking asshole thing to do. And um,

1169
01:09:53.210 --> 01:09:54.043
and women,

1170
01:09:54.260 --> 01:09:59.210
if you hook up with the guy and he's fucking terrible or he's got a little Dick

1171
01:09:59.211 --> 01:10:02.420
and all that type of shit, right? Uh,

1172
01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:05.260
if he's not out there talking shit for you to walk around,

1173
01:10:05.261 --> 01:10:07.780
fucking doing that too. That's another fucking asshole move.

1174
01:10:07.781 --> 01:10:12.280
It's an asshole move either way. And in this case, the guy's the asshole. So,

1175
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:17.140
um, I dunno, you know something, if you can hang on until Thursday,

1176
01:10:17.141 --> 01:10:20.830
I'll run it by near a, I'll ever run again and I'll run it by her.

1177
01:10:20.831 --> 01:10:25.640
It's just that she's still sleeping here. So, um, anyways.

1178
01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:28.250
All right, let me a, that's it for the questions.

1179
01:10:28.251 --> 01:10:30.800
Let me read the last two advertisements here and then, uh,

1180
01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:34.810
I got some pumpkin bread to make. Alright. Uh, SeatGeek uh,

1181
01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:39.170
buying tickets online for sports and concerts has been a confusing process for a

1182
01:10:39.171 --> 01:10:40.004
long time.

1183
01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:43.580
It's always been hard to find the best deal for that game or show you want to go

1184
01:10:43.581 --> 01:10:46.640
to. And none of those older ticket sites want to change that,

1185
01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:48.860
but it Siki kids different.

1186
01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:52.940
They've come along and created an amazing app and website that makes it easier

1187
01:10:53.210 --> 01:10:55.400
than ever for fans to buy and sell tickets.

1188
01:10:55.910 --> 01:11:00.500
Siki does all the price comparisons for you by searching multiple tickets sites

1189
01:11:00.501 --> 01:11:05.501
and ensuring that you get the best possible deal and Siki wants to help you get

1190
01:11:05.571 --> 01:11:06.950

1191
01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:11.060
That's why every ticket on seek is given a grade based on value.

1192
01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:15.630

1193

1203
01:11:52.981 --> 01:11:56.490
Meda is the only way to get postage without having to go to the post office,

1204
01:11:56.491 --> 01:11:57.100
but they are

1205
01:11:57.100 --> 01:12:00.550
<v 3>wrong. Wrong, wrong.</v>
