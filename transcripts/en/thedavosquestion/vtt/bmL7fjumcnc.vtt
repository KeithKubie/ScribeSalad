00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
&gt;&gt; I think India can become a superpower because
it has the population

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.419
and the kind of population that would make
it one.

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:11.259
But you think in order for India to do that,
it's really going to have

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:15.809
to concentrate on education far more than
it's done in the past.

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.740
It strikes me that the education in India
has to start at the basic

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.930
level, elementary school, work its way through
the middle school and

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.480
high school.
I worry less about universities in India,

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.460
both because I think they
will and can develop faster, and because university

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.640
education for
Indians can be done off-shore.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.960
So we just have to hope that India's education
system will equal it's

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.450
wise as a superpower.
