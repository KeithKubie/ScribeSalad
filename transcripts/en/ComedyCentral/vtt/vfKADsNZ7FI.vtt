THAT'S WHERE GIFS START IN ONE
WAY BUT GO IN A WAY THAT IS

00:00:27.928 --> 00:00:30.130
UNEXPECTED, THEREFORE
JUSTIFYING THE TITLE

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:31.398

HERE WE GOT THE DALI LAMA
TRYING ON SUNGLASSES.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.009
HE'S GOT TO PROTECT HIS EYES SO
HE CAN SEE ALL.

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:45.879
WILL HE START SHAKING HIS HEAD
AND PANTOMIME THE PIANO?

00:00:45.913 --> 00:00:48.348
OR REMOVE THE GLASSES
AND SHOOT LASERS OUT

00:00:48.382 --> 00:00:48.982
OF HIS EYES?

00:00:49.016 --> 00:00:50.150
MYQ KAPLAN.

00:00:50.184 --> 00:00:53.754
&gt;&gt; I GUESS HE IS GOING TO SHOOT
LASERS OUT OF HIS EYES.

00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:55.022
&gt;&gt; Chris: YES.

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:56.323
SHOOTING LASERS OUT OF HIS EYES.

00:00:56.356 --> 00:01:00.394

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:09.837
&gt;&gt; Chris: THIS LITTLE KID ON A
SKATEBOARD.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.506
WILL THIS LITTLE FELLA STAND UP
AND PERFECTLY PERFORM A 360

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:15.509
KICKFLIP OR NEVER GET UP
AND HARMLESSLY MISS

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:17.211
THE NEXT RAMP ENTIRELY?

00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:18.378
YES, JAMIE LEE?

00:01:18.412 --> 00:01:21.248

MISS THE NEXT RAMP ENTIRELY.

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:23.083
&gt;&gt; Chris: I LIKE THE WAY YOU
THINK.

00:01:23.116 --> 00:01:23.917
THAT IS THE CORRECT ANSWER.

00:01:23.951 --> 00:01:26.954
LET US SEE HOW THAT PLAYS OUT.

00:01:26.987 --> 00:01:31.325
(LAUGHTER)
THERE HE GOES.

00:01:31.358 --> 00:01:35.262
&gt;&gt; THAT'S LIKE THE COOLEST WAY
TO RUN AWAY FROM HOME.

00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:38.465
&gt;&gt; Chris: AND THEY NEVER SAW HIM
AGAIN!

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:42.503
(LAUGHTER)
ALL RIGHT, NEXT ONE.

00:01:42.536 --> 00:01:44.371
WHAT HAPPENS TO THIS ANIME
CHARACTER?

00:01:44.404 --> 00:01:46.840
WILL SHE REVEAL THAT HER
NETHER-REGIONS ARE ACTUALLY

00:01:46.874 --> 00:01:48.175
SHREK?

00:01:48.208 --> 00:01:50.978
JUST PICTURE THAT FOR A SECOND.

00:01:51.011 --> 00:01:53.614
OR RIDE A UNICORN
INTO THE SUN, CAUSING

00:01:53.647 --> 00:01:55.749
THE UNICORN APOCALYPSE?

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:56.717
YES, STEVE AGEE?

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.018
&gt;&gt; SHREK PARTS.

00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:04.825
(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; Chris: SHOW ME SHREK (BLEEP)!

00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:07.761
YAY!

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:10.731
&gt;&gt; NICE.

00:02:10.764 --> 00:02:12.900
&gt;&gt; HE LOOKS SO SAFE.

00:02:12.933 --> 00:02:17.671
&gt;&gt; Chris: PLEASE DON'T GET THAT
NEAR ME.

00:02:17.704 --> 00:02:19.573
&gt;&gt; THAT (BLEEP) IS SHREKED!

00:02:19.606 --> 00:02:28.448
(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; Chris: I'LL GIVE HIM POINTS

00:02:28.482 --> 00:02:30.417
FOR THAT.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.386
ALL RIGHT, THIS NEXT ONE, THE
MIGHTY MORPHIN POWER RANGERS.

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:35.222
WILL THEY: REVEAL THEMSELVES
TO BE SECRET NAZI'S OR

00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:37.624
EACH EXPLODE INTO DIFFERENT
KINDS OF DRAGONS?

00:02:37.658 --> 00:02:38.392
MYQ KAPLAN.

00:02:38.425 --> 00:02:39.459
&gt;&gt; PLEASE NAZIS.

00:02:39.493 --> 00:02:40.360
&gt;&gt; Chris: YES!

00:02:40.394 --> 00:02:46.733
YOU ARE ABOUT TO BE REWARDED,
MYQ KAPLAN.

00:02:46.767 --> 00:02:53.874
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
&gt;&gt; ALSO I HAVE NEVER SAID,

00:02:53.907 --> 00:02:55.108
"PLEASE NAZIS" BEFORE.

00:02:55.108 --> 00:03:00.113
(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; I LIKE HOW THEY'RE ALL

00:03:00.147 --> 00:03:03.450
HAILING BUT THE PINK ONE'S LIKE
"HEY, KAREN!"

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:06.920
&gt;&gt; Chris: "HEY, HITLER!"
&gt;&gt; "HEY, GIRL, HEY!"

00:03:06.954 --> 00:03:09.156
"GOOD TO SEE YOU, YOU LOOK
GOOD!

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:09.256
NICE 'STACHE."
