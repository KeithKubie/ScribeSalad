00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.221
The answer here is 0.57.

00:00:04.221 --> 00:00:08.619
And in order to get this answer the
first thing that we should do is convert

00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:10.730
1/4 into a decimal.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.520
Let's use our regular procedure for
turning a fraction into a decimal.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.490
4 goes into 1, 0 times.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.750
4 goes into 10, 2 times.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.234
2 x 4 is 8, subtract that and get 2.

00:00:22.234 --> 00:00:26.510
Bring down a 0 and
4 goes into 20, 5 times.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.251
4 x 5 is 20.

00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:33.080
Do our subtraction and hey, we have 0,
so we can just stop right here.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.254
1/4 as a decimal is 0.25.

00:00:36.254 --> 00:00:43.384
So 1/4 + 0.32 is really
the same thing as 0.25 + 0.32.

00:00:43.384 --> 00:00:45.806
And what we're left with is 0.57.

00:00:45.806 --> 00:00:48.189
