00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
The other day I was going out with some friends

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.720
when one of them said, “You're wearing that?”

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.751
and I immediately spiraled.

00:00:06.751 --> 00:00:07.737
Oh my God, what do I say?

00:00:07.737 --> 00:00:09.087
I didn’t bring anything else. She hates me!

00:00:09.087 --> 00:00:12.087
Oh my God. She hates my outfit, she hates me, they all hate me!

00:00:12.087 --> 00:00:15.143
Why did I bother thinking I could have any social interaction ever.

00:00:15.143 --> 00:00:18.157
Then, every instance in which I have been asked that question

00:00:18.157 --> 00:00:21.515
flashed before my eyes like some kind of fashionable death or something.

00:00:21.515 --> 00:00:24.216
My mother: “You're wearing that to school?”

00:00:24.216 --> 00:00:26.872
My ex-boyfriend: “You're wearing that to dinner?”

00:00:26.872 --> 00:00:28.991
Even by my therapist once:

00:00:28.991 --> 00:00:31.889
“You’re wearing that to a business meeting?”

00:00:31.889 --> 00:00:36.358
Yeah, but it's— it's for a cat brand, so it actu— it makes sense, ok.

00:00:36.358 --> 00:00:37.538
I'm not going to let you judge me for this.

00:00:37.538 --> 00:00:39.881
Not to mention the countless times I myself

00:00:39.881 --> 00:00:43.201
have looked into my reflection with utter disdain and wondered,

00:00:43.201 --> 00:00:44.488
what the hell am I wearing,

00:00:44.488 --> 00:00:48.876
why do I look like this, and why is coordinating outfits so damn hard?

00:00:48.876 --> 00:00:51.960
This question is particularly triggering because in three words,

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.594
it immediately insights self-doubt, self-consciousness,

00:00:54.594 --> 00:00:57.190
insecurity, shame, guilt, and more,

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.656
and often, the first time girls will hear it

00:00:59.656 --> 00:01:02.190
is from our disapproving parental figures

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.733
when we’re at that fragile period

00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:06.193
of exploring our sexuality and identity.

00:01:06.193 --> 00:01:08.919
So, when someone asks me if I'm wearing "that",

00:01:08.919 --> 00:01:11.666
I can't help but immediately feel like I've done something wrong.

00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:12.757
And some of you may be thinking,

00:01:12.757 --> 00:01:14.870
oh my gosh, who cares, like wear whatever you want,

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.477
let your freak flag fly—but that's the problem.

00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:20.056
I have been, and you know what it's gotten me?

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.560
Judgment, lots of judgment, but what's helped

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.260
is remembering that though it sounds judgy as hell,

00:01:25.265 --> 00:01:28.747
the core of this question comes from a place of concern.

00:01:28.747 --> 00:01:30.600
I just don't want you to get harassed by boys.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.380
I just don't want you to be cold...

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.860
cuz then you’re gonna steal my jacket and then I'll be cold,

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.940
but I’ll give you my jacket, and I’ll be cold, but I don't want to be cold, so—

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.256
I just want them to take you seriously at work.

00:01:40.256 --> 00:01:42.199
But actually with that context, yeah,

00:01:42.199 --> 00:01:44.550
I think they’d appreciate this. Carry on.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.494
And sometimes people don't even realize how offensive it can be

00:01:47.494 --> 00:01:49.622
cuz I myself have definitely asked a friend.

00:01:49.622 --> 00:01:50.880
Is that what you're wearing?

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.160
Is that what you're wearing.
Is that what you're wearing?

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.995
Is that what you're wearing?

00:01:55.995 --> 00:01:59.378
Hell yes, this is what I’m wearing. Do you have a problem with it?

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.460
What? No, I'm sorry. I just wanted to make sure that

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.700
I matched your level of like fanciness or casualness

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.076
so that I don't stick out.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.820
Oh ok, sorry. Just got real self conscious there.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.860
Yeah. No, I totally saw those memories flash in front of you, I’m sorry.
