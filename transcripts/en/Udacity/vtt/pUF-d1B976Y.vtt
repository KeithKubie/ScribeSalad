00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.340
When we just ran the Pitch Perfect app,
we saw that the segue is getting cold.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.880
But that the play sounds view
controller still does not know the path

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:08.740
of the recorded audio.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.790
When the segue is called,
there's a function that's triggered on

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.960
the existing view controller
to help it prepare for segue.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.440
It is called, prepare for seg.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.040
Remember this is on the existing view
controller, not the one we're going to.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.470
So let's open up record
sounds view controller and

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.420
scroll towards the bottom.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.129
If we start typing prepare, we see that
auto complete fills our prepare for

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:35.183
interface or prepare for segue.

00:00:35.183 --> 00:00:37.656
Let's choose prepare for segue.

00:00:37.656 --> 00:00:40.600
In the prepare for segue function,
we need to add a few lines of code.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.860
First we check that this
is a segue that we want.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.330
That it has the stop
recording identifier.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.810
Then we can grab the play
sounds view controller

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.210
from the handy property
destination view controller.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.770
Because this property is of
type UI view controller, but

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.990
we know it's a play sounds view
controller, we can downcast it.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.670
As you see here with the as!

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.239
Next we grab the sender,
which is where we pack URL.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.030
And finally,

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.220
we set the record audio property of the
play sound view controller to that URL.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.120
Now, the play sounds view controller is
receiving the recorded audio file URL

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.150
and is set for playback.
