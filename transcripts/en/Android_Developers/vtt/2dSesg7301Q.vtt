SPEAKER: In this
video, we'll explain

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.280
how to defer a subscription
renewal date for a user.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.160
This is often used as a
customer service tool in case

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.430
the user experiences
issues with your service.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.530
For example, if
the user contacts

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.190
you to ask for help during
a known service outage,

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.840
you can respond by deferring
their subscription renewal.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.470
Using the Google
Play Developer API,

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.430
you can advance the next
billing date for a subscriber.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.130
The user continues to be
subscribed to the content

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.650
and has full access to
it but is not charged

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.240
during the deferral period.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.800
The subscription
renewal date will

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.170
be updated to reflect
the new billing date that

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.680
was passed to the API.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.280
You can advance the renewal date
by as little as one day or as

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.690
long as one year per API call.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.030
Once this is done,
you may want to notify

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.150
the user of this change to
their billing either in the app

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.440
or through email.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.750
