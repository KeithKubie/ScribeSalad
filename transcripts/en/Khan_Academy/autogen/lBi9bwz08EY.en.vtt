00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.800
 I'll warm up with a few easy examples of 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.280
 multiplying fractions or multiplying rational numbers - 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.670
 a rational number is just another way to say 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.360
 "liver", this is any number that can be expressed 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.790
 as a liver. 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.190
 And then we will solve a textual task that deals with 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:17.750
 the multiplication of fractions. 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.280
 Let us decide part a. 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.420
 5/12 at 9/10. 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.100
 The fun thing about multiplying and dividing 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.750
 of fractions, at least for me, is that it's easier than collecting 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.300
 or subtraction, literally simply multiplying the numerators, 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.250
 when multiplying, and multiplying the denominators. 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.740
 So you can say that this is the same thing as 5 * 9 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.450
 on 12 * 10. 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.730
 And we can simply multiply these, 45/120. 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.170
 But it will not be the simplest type. 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.970
 We will multiply these large numbers. 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.830
 And before we do that we can divide the numerator 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.020
 the number denominator, which will simplify them a little. 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.540
 Let's do that. 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.330
 If we divide the numerator and the denominator into 5, then 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.790
 this will become 1, and this will be 2. 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.090
 If we divide the numerator and the denominator into 3, 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.430
 this will be 3, and this will become 4. 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.850
 So this whole thing was simplified to 1 * 3, which 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.250
 is 3 on ... 4 * 2, 3/8, which is a lot easier 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.020
 than 45/120. 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.600
 All right. 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.210
 Let us decide part with. 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.690
 (3/4) * (1/3). 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.880
 We can fully apply the same principle. 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.000
 This will be 3 * 1 on 4 * 3. 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.730
 We can skip a step if we want and cut the threes in 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.110
 numerator and denominator. 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.890
 You divide the numerator and the denominator into 3. 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.270
 You can say that this is 1 and this is 1. 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.930
 And you will say that 1/4 of 1, 1 on 1 is equal to 1/4. 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.000
 And here I missed one step, but in general I just said, 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.950
 that it would be the same thing as 3 * 1 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.970
 on 4 * 3. 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.030
 You divide the numerator and denominator of 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.730
 3 and you get 1/4. 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.420
 That's exactly the same thing. 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.410
 I'll decide f and just to finish things. 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:18.780
 is is (1/13) * (1/11). 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.570
 We just multiply the numerators. 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.250
 We get 1 as 13 * 11. 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.790
 Let's see, 13 * 10 is 130 and you have to 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.690
 we have another one here. 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:36.350
 So it would be 143 if I calculated correctly. 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.290
 Yes, 13 * 10 is 130. 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.900
 Yes. 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.330
 It seems to me right. 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.230
 Okay, one more to warm up. 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.570
 All right. 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.380
 I will decide part f. 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.660
 (7/27) * (9/14). 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.890
 We can apply the same trick we applied here. 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.670
 You divide the numerator and the denominator into 7, so that 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.080
 becomes 1, and this becomes 2. 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.920
 Then we can divide the numerator and the denominator 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.220
 at 9, this becomes 1, and this becomes 3. 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:15.380
 This becomes 1 * 1 on 3 * 2 or 1/6. 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.460
 Or you can just say 7 * 9, which is 63, on 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.040
 27 * 14, which is a large number I do not know 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.200
 the exact number and it would take a long time 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.560
 to shorten it to the simplest look. 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.030
 But this way, when you divide it in advance, it is 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.930
 quite simply. 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.540
 Let's solve a textual problem. 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.860
 It includes monkeys. 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.280
 "Three monkeys spent one day collecting 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.820
 of coconuts together. 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.820
 When they were over, they were a lot 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.750
 tired and asleep. 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.460
 The next morning the first monkey wakes up. 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.590
 He does not want to bother his friends and decides to split 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.980
 cocoons in three equal stacks. 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.630
 There is one redundant, so throw it, 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.850
 takes his share and returns. " 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.000
 This is the third monkey. 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.330
 He divides what he sees into three stacks. 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.780
 We do not know how many in each pile. 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.200
 Cup 1, Stack 2, Stack 3. 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.660
 And then there was an extra coconut he threw. 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.240
 This is a coconut here. 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.290
 This first monkey divides the coconuts of 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.190
 three equal stacks. 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.840
 There was one redundant one, so he threw it, 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.230
 takes his share and returns. 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:42.200
 Its share is, let's say, take that share 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.980
 throws this away. 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.060
 That tells us. 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.340
 He decides to divide the cocoons into three equal 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.860
 piles, there is one redundant and throws it, 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.100
 and then he takes his share. 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.180
 All right. 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.880
 "A few minutes later, the second monkey wakes up. 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.830
 She does not realize what the first one did, so he also divides 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.820
 cocoons in three equal stacks. 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.020
 One remains, he throws it and 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.740
 takes his share. 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.280
 He finds one remaining coco, throws it, 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.550
 takes his share. 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.430
 This is the second monkey. 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.510
 That's all he sees. 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.350
 He sees these two stacks. 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.040
 He divides these into three equal stacks. 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.980
 Perhaps this is a heap here, it is - let me do it 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.930
 slightly more equal. 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.650
 This is a pile, these are two stacks and this - 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.130
 in fact, he also sees that there is an extra coconut here. 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:43.180
 Let me make it clear. 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.600
 He finds one superfluous, finds that there is an extra coconut, 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.040
 then the rest - remember, it's over 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.610
 it's over. 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.550
 We're only dealing with this at the moment. 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.040
 One redundant and three equal piles. 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:01.660
 One pile, two stacks and three piles. 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.810
 And then he takes this for himself. 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.220
 Take one for yourself and take the excess coconut 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.310
 then throw it away. 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:16.120
 Now that's all we have left. 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.690
 And then you can guess what's going on. 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.460
 "In the morning the third monkey wakes up and sees it 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.530
 she is alone. 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:26.690
 He notices the two eaten coconuts and places them 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.700
 in the stack. " 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:29.420
 Interesting. 

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.440
 "He puts them in the pile, and that 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.530
 gives him a total of 12 cocoons. " 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.720
 That is, he notices this and that, putting them 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.000
 back into the pile. 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.150
 This is the first - or perhaps I must say - 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:47.490
 this is the first monkey or three monkeys - in fact, 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:48.870
 I must say that this is the first monkey. 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:53.150
 The first monkey did this, then the second monkey now 

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.980
 we're dealing with the third monkey. 

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:59.650
 He notices the two discarded cocoons and places them 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:01.210
 in the stack that gives her a total of 12. 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.770
 This is the third monkey, the third one that wakes up. 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.190
 I'm sorry if I confused you. 

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:08.560
 This one woke up first, there was one redundant one 

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.620
 with three equal piles. 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.860
 One superfluous holds one for himself. 

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:17.010
 The second monkey sees these cocoons, makes three equal 

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:18.810
 piles, there is one redundant. 

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:23.300
 Then the third monkey wakes up, sees these two cocoons, 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.490
 and then he sees what's in the stack and he's there 

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:31.960
 a total of 12 cocoons. 

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.350
 So they ask us: "How many cocoa have taken 

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:37.660
 the first and second monkeys? " 

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:38.630
 All right. 

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:41.300
 Actually let me make it clear. 

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.170
 There are 12 cocoons in total. 

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:46.690
 Here are 12 coconuts after they are taken 

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:48.120
 those who were thrown. 

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:54.900
 That's 12, this must be 10 cocoa. 

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:58.750
 That's 10 coco and if you look at these two 

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:03.010
 stacks that are left, this must be 5 cocoons, 

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:06.070
 5 coconut and he has taken 5 cocoons. 

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:09.760
 And if you get to this point here, how many coco 

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.710
 were they there? 

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:15.560
 There must have been 15 plus this 1 coco here. 

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.520
 The first monkey must have had 16 cocoons 

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.000
 in these two piles. 

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.600
 This must have been 8 and 8. 

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.630
 And then he took an equal share of 8. 

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:31.130
 For starters, we had 8 * 3, 24 cocoa plus 1. 

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:34.320
 We started with 25 cocoa. 

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:39.340
 This one took 8, then we had 16 cocoons. 

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.940
 He has taken 8, discarded 1, so there were only 16 left. 

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:45.960
 The second monkey has come and told her she will 

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.400
 divided them into 3 groups of 5. 

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.400
 There is one redundant one. 

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.690
 He picks 5. 

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:54.940
 Then you have 10 remaining, plus the two discarded and total 12.
