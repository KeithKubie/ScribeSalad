00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:01.590
MMMMM salt.

00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:03.409
It’s like my second favorite food group.

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:06.490
After chocolate, of course.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:13.250
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.500
There are warnings abound about the dangers
of a high sodium diet.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.890
And it’s true that most packaged foods are
full of the stuff.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.230
Probably half the reason it tastes so good,
to be honest.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.210
But just how terrible is salt?

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.711
Is there such thing as not enough?

00:00:25.711 --> 00:00:29.680
A new international study in the New England
Journal of Medicine monitored over 100,000

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.540
people in 17 countries for 4 years and found
that those who ate MODERATE amounts of salt

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.930
were healthier than those who consumed A LOT
of salt and those who only consumed a LITTLE

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:40.930
salt.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.579
They defined “moderate” as 3000-6000mg
a day.

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:49.270
For perspective, Americans eat 3400mg of salt
a day and the World Health Organization recommends

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.629
that people only consume about 2000mg a day.

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.680
The scientists found that those who consume
between 3000-6000mg of salt have a lower risk

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.989
of cardiovascular issues.

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.800
They also had a lower risk of death over the
4 year study.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.439
They tracked the patients’ salt intake with
daily urine samples in the morning, which

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:09.790
is a reliable way to measure how much sodium
and potassium the individual had consumed.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.009
The potassium was important to track because
it protects against some of the negative effects

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:15.130
of salt, like raising your blood pressure.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.829
Those who ate more than 1500mg of potassium
a day were *also* less likely to have heart

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:20.880
disease or die.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.209
Not that surprising, both because of potassium's
effect on salt and because potassium is in

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:26.389
a lot of fruits and veggies.

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:28.759
Those people probably have healthier diets.

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.119
The researchers emphasize what some recent
studies have been finding: it is possible

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.669
to get too LITTLE salt, especially amongst
generally healthy people.

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:39.969
And it’s possible that all of the high sodium
fear is a little misguided.

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:43.580
Another study last April in the American Journal
of Hypertension found that those who consume

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:50.270
2500-5000mg of salt per day have lower mortality
rates and that low sodium diets could be harmful

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.310
to the healthy.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.909
The Institute of Medicine also released a
report last year finding that consuming under

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.979
2300mg a day didn’t prevent heart disease.

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.000
Still, the American Heart Association isn’t
convinced - they say the methods of the new

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.139
study are questionable, especially how they
measured the salt in peoples urine.

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:10.119
There’s also another study in the same issue
of the New England Journal of Medicine with

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.200
directly conflicting findings.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.190
The second study, carried out at Harvard,
found that 1.65 million global cardiovascular

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.950
deaths are linked with high sodium consumption.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.000
Unfortunately because the evidence is so conflicted,
there’s no final word on salt yet.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.560
In the meantime, it appears to be safer to
err on the side of *not enough* salt than

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.560
*too much*.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.709
Do you eat a lot of salt?

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:31.709
Or are you low sodium?

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.680
Tell me about it in the comments and I’ll
see you next time.
