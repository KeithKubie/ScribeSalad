00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.820
 Welcome to Hong Kong: An incredible density of Chinese island cities with a population of 7 million 

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.630
 But if you, a traveler, from Victoria Harbour to the mainland, 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.890
 You will find that Hong Kong is China, but she does not look like it. 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.580
 If you want to enter, your passport must be inspected, stamped, checked, and stamped. 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.749
 Not because you are very suspicious: mainland Chinese cannot go directly. 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:22.029
 Just because Hong Kong has her own immigration policy. 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.119
 And Hong Kong is not the only isolated island, next door to Macau. 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.970
 The border and port also need a passport. If you are departing from Hong Kong 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.010
 Go to Macau, then the mainland, come back. You will be stamped three times, everyone is the same: 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.390
 Hong Kong people cannot live in Macau directly in Macau. 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.629
 They also cannot live directly on the mainland. 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.039
 Although they belong to China, and the troublesome travel is not the only special thing about these sister islands. 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:45.479
 They also have: 

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:47.679
 * Different governments and political parties. * Different police officers. 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:48.930
 * Different currencies. * Postal system. 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.010
 * School. * and language. 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.640
 Hong Kong even has her own Olympic team fighting a pain in the 2008 Beijing Olympics. 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.600
 It seems like.. Nothing.. Isn't it right? 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.079
 The only one of these sister islands is not, but what other countries have is: 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:01.239
 1) Your own army. 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.980
 Although this is nothing special for modern countries, there are... 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.900
 2) Formal diplomatic relations. 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.390
 Although these are a bit messy, because both are members of the international trade organization. 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.190
 And other countries have embassies in Hong Kong and Macau. Of course China will not recognize them as embassies. 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.330
 Those are limited to **mighty Beijing** -- they are called "consulates" 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.340
 Although they are bigger than the embassy in Beijing. 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.090
 All of this makes Hong Kong and Macau, as I said in the previous video: 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.000
 The most country-like countries that are the countries in the world - not the country - the most country-like countries that aren't countries. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.540
 Then why are they called China? 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.560
 Because China said. 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.280
 This is called "one country, two systems". 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.450
 I think it should be called "one country, three systems". 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.720
 (In that unimpeded development of capitalism) makes it more like "one country, four systems" 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.160
 And if China is embarrassed, it may become "one country, five systems." 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.540
 We can't cover so much content, so we go back to China, Hong Kong and Macau. 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.670
 The reason why China has these two city-states is as usual, because of the empire. 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.560
 Portugal appeared in Asia in the 1500s but was not friendly with China. China and Portugal 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.910
 Continued clashes until Portugal used a lot of money in diplomatic methods to bribe local Chinese officials 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.590
 Make the island of Macau a trading port. 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.520
 After that, Great Britain discovered China, and at the same time she found many things she wanted, such as silk. 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.450
 Porcelain, and treasures - the much-needed tea in Great Britain. In turn, China wants Great Britain 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.410
 Rolling for Laozi~ Great Britain recognizes China’s independence and sovereignty..... 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.790
 Wait!! 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.280
 Crow ~ film ~ war ~ fight ~! 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.180
 Nothing can produce more demand than addiction. Great Britain is happy to offer. And through 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.000
 Artillery diplomacy ensures that Hong Kong is used as a base because it must maintain drug circulation. 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.250
 Then, in a world where telegraphs and light bulbs are very novel. A contract will take ownership of Hong Kong. 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.060
 Give Great Britain 99 years or say "and never difference", kick the transfer problem to 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.569
 The unimaginable future generation of the 1990 generation came to deal with. 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.140
 In this way, these sister cities grew up under the influence of their empire’s parents. 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.100
 Hong Kong has the common law of the United Kingdom and belongs to the structure of Great Britain like other colonies. 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.100
 And Macau has the civil law of Portugal. 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.380
 And the influence of their parents can still be seen today: Visiting Hong Kong will find that she is obviously the daughter of Great Britain. 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.340
 Her owner's love of the economy and international finance (laser!) and British accent 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.430
 There is exactly the same transportation system. 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.740
 Macau has more troublesome puberty because her sister has taken all the highlights through trade. 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.209
 But Macau eventually grew into the gambling capital of the world. 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.080
 She is 10 times that of Las Vegas and is a hybrid of China and Portugal. 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.680
 But the empire will eventually die out, and the 1990s will eventually come, meaning that the contract of Great Britain has expired. 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.780
 Portugal claims that the treaty gives her *indefinite* control over Macau but China does not agree 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.590
 The attitude of the United Nations is "I don’t think of an empire," and if Portugal complains too much, 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.069
 China can use its own war diplomacy to solve problems. 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.370
 So the transfer will still happen: but the world is nervous about China, 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.740
 Because *can't erase the communist* these, so these daughters of the empire will go 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.430
 But they must basically remain independent, China agrees, as long as other countries 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.180
 Call them China. 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.240
 This situation is a bit like if the United States wants to return Alaska to Russia. 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.569
 And Russia* absolutely* guarantees Alaska government autonomy. You can't blame the local people for being nervous. 

00:03:56.119 --> 00:04:00.520
 However, unlike what you think, most of China guarantees the independence of these sister islands. 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.980
 So everything is fine... 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:02.620
 *however*... 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.550
 Handover has its own version of the 'and never difference' clause 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:13.150
 China has not agreed to let Hong Kong and Macau* be forever * independent, but only 50 years 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.709
 So once again, the political issue is handed over to future generations. (I hope this time is really impossible to futify the phenomenon). 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.829
 In any case, it is irrelevant to assume that these indifferent concerns are singular. 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.229
 What will happen in 2040? Will Hong Kong and Macau maintain a small city state? 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:28.800
 Or will they lose their independence and be absorbed? 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.300
 Only China knows, but China will not say it.
