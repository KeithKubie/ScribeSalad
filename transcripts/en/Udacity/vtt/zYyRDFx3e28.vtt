00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.830
Hey, I'm Walter, your instructor.

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.360
After learning all the cool
things you can do with code,

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.189
writing documentation
might seem a bit stale.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.070
I'm here to show you why that's,
in fact, not the case and

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.940
why you should get excited
about documenting your code.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.410
In this course you'll be cooking
up your very own readme file.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.150
You'll learn what documentation is and

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.860
why it's an important part of
the development process and

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.970
you'll be able to incorporate it
into your projects moving forward.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.760
This course is relevant to
anyone who either writes code or

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.390
works with others who do.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.570
Throughout this course, you'll be
seeing examples of documentation for

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.780
a variety of tools and languages, some
will be familiar and others will not.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.080
That's okay.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.730
Focus on the concepts, not the actual
code that we'll be documenting.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.650
To help us get started, I've cooked
up a little something for you.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.047
How does this relate to readme's?

00:00:50.047 --> 00:00:51.500
Well, you'll understand in a minute.
