of rules that everybody knows it's a
 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.219
of rules that everybody knows it's a
little bit like in corporate law there's

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229
little bit like in corporate law there's
 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.499

already knows how it decides things got

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380
already knows how it decides things got
 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.520
already knows how it decides things got
this very stable system and that means

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530
this very stable system and that means
 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.670
this very stable system and that means
the lawsuits rarely have to go all the

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680
the lawsuits rarely have to go all the
 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.770
the lawsuits rarely have to go all the
way in Delaware because it's so

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780
way in Delaware because it's so
 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.749
way in Delaware because it's so
predictable everybody knows how it's

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759
predictable everybody knows how it's
 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.730
predictable everybody knows how it's
going to be decided and so they save all

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740
going to be decided and so they save all
 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.350
