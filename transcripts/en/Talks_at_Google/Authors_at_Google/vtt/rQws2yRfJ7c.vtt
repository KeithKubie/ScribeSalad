[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.160
NANCY: I'm really, really
pleased to be welcoming

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.860
Professor Benjamin Bergen here
as part of Talks at Google.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.950
So without further ado, I'm
happy to hand it over to Ben.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:16.450
So.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:17.866
BENJAMIN BERGEN:
Thank you, Nancy.

00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:18.730
Thank you very much.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.670
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.230
BENJAMIN BERGEN: So
I'm really thrilled

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.190
to be back in the homeland and
to talk to you about the topic

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.540
of my latest book.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:37.500
Now, as Nancy said, there
will be strong language.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.510
Empirically strong language.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.820
There will be objectively the
worst words of the language

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:44.990
on the next slide.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.970
So this is a great
time-- if you feel

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.820
like you might be uncomfortable
with that sort of thing--

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.280
to conveniently need to slip
out and go get some coffee.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.700
OK, so human language
serves a variety

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.770
of communicative functions.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.030
The function that we
usually think about

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.410
is conveying information
through time and space--

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.801
facts, descriptions of things.

00:01:09.801 --> 00:01:11.800
And that's certainly a
thing that language does.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.300
But it does something
else, as well.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.000
And that's to convey emotion.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.690
In the hot cognition
of immediate feelings,

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.230
we need some way to
communicate with conspecifics

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.390
that we're angry right now.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.370
We're frustrated or frightened.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.310
And this is where
profanity thrives.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.190
So what I've tried
to do in this book

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.360
is to take an empirical,
cognitive science-based

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.350
approach to what profanity
is, how it works,

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.400
how it comes to be that
way, how it changes over

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.850
time, and importantly,
what it reveals

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.460
about our brains, our
social lives, and ourselves.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.190
So what I wanted to do
today was to give you

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.890
a brief tour of
some of the things

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.440
that we learn about profanity
and about ourselves,

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.530
our brains, by taking
this leap of faith.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.970
And to begin with, I
want to start empirically

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.050
by asking what
precisely profanity

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.539
is, where it comes from.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.100
What words do we
mean by profanity?

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.570
Why are those words profane?

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.060
And if you were to ask
regulatory agencies

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.550
like the FCC, for example,
they wouldn't give you a list.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.210
Because they haven't
done the legwork.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.710
They don't actually
know empirically

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.450
what people think is
offensive language.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.750
But fortunately, we
do have some evidence

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.460
from large-scale
psycholinguistics studies

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.220
that tell us broadly
what the types of words

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.460
are that people find profane.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.710
And more specifically,
exactly which

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.510
ones a particular
group of people

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.980
find offensive at a
particular time and place.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.580
So let's start locally.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.140
Let's start in California with
people in their, say, 20s.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.990
What are the worst words of
American English according

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.050
to these people?

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.520
So here's a study from
about 10 years ago at UCLA

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:05.266
that asked undergrads, who
would now be in their mid-20s,

00:03:05.266 --> 00:03:07.030
how would you rate
a list of words

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.830
in terms of their offensiveness,
one word at a time?

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.840
And here are,
without further ado,

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.730
the words that are
worst in English

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.240
according to these respondents
from worst to least bad.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:32.040
So some things to note,
for contemporary speakers

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.130
of American English,
including especially younger

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.120
ones, the worst
words in the language

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.420
are predominantly not the
words that George Carlin

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.750
would have told you 50
years ago are the ones you

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:43.860
can't say on television.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.580
They're a new class of
words-- slurs, in fact.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:52.370
Words that derogate by insulting
a particular social group

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.590
because of their
ethnicity or religion,

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.770
sex, sexual
orientation, and so on.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.600
And in fact, you find
that a four-letter word

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.210
that starts with f is
actually 13th on the list.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.550
We can go down the list
if you want and find

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.090
a whole bunch more offensive
words until we get down

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.290
to a famous four-letter word
that starts with S-H that

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.867
doesn't appear to be
that offensive at all

00:04:16.867 --> 00:04:18.950
compared to the rest of
the words in the language.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.630
Now, when we compare
language taboos

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.100
across the world's
languages, what we discover

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.440
is that the types of words
that feed into this list

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.380
are actually quite
representative of the world's

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.290
languages.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.490
Across the globe, there
are four categories

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.580
of words that seem to be
most reliable in providing

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.650
the taboo vocabulary
of a language.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.110
That is words relating to
religious concepts, words

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.860
relating to sex and sexual
activities, words relating

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.980
to other bodily
functions, the organs that

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.100
are responsible for
those functions,

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.150
the actions involved
in those functions,

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.280
the upkeep of those bodily
functions, and so on.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.630
And then finally, slurs.

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.600
And those are kind of
the big four categories

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.580
that contribute
profane vocabulary.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.780
And if you were to categorize
the list of most offensive

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.102
words in English by which
of these four categories

00:05:17.102 --> 00:05:18.810
they most properly
belong to-- of course,

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.080
there's a little
bit of wiggle room

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.350
here-- you would find that
in English, it is indeed

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.870
the slurs that, on average
and in specific cases,

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.540
are judged to be the most
profane words of the language,

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.530
the most offensive
words of the language.

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.750
Copulation is also
a near second best.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.260
And religion doesn't really
provide much profane vocabulary

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.729
to contemporary
American English at all.

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:48.270
Across the world,
different languages

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.130
will sample differently
from each of these columns.

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.930
So if you look at Italian,
for example, the strongest

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.610
words in Italian
known as bestemmie,

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.670
are basically the
formula is this.

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:04.475
You take the word pig, and you
add it to a religious term.

00:06:04.475 --> 00:06:06.600
And that gives you a really,
really offensive term.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.850
So [SPEAKING ITALIAN]
or [SPEAKING ITALIAN],

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.190
really, really offensive.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.470
Sorry, Italians.

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.590
In Quebecois French,
spoken north of the border,

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.620
the worst words are
these words called

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.120
sacres, which are
Catholic liturgical terms

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.900
like [SPEAKING FRENCH],
or tabernacle,

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.850
or [SPEAKING FRENCH],
which is chalice.

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.430
And these words are far more
offensive than any of the words

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.080
that we have on this list for
speakers of Quebecois French.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.550
So around the world, languages
will sample differently

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.600
from these groups to find their
most offensive terminology.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.790
Russian has recently experienced
a big regulatory change.

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:50.390
Putin's government
has outlawed a set

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:53.850
of words known as mat, which
are pretty much all drawn

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.720
from sexual vocabulary.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.970
And those can now no
longer be used in the arts

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.100
or media in general.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.920
So there are differences
across the world's languages.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.090
Now, you may be looking
at these words and saying,

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:09.030
well, OK, this is where
the words come from.

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:10.730
But there's a lot.

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.270
That can't be sufficient, right?

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:13.820
There's lots of
words that relate

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.030
to copulation or to bodily
functions that are not obscene,

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:17.530
right?

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:19.920
Words that you
would describe when

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.580
talking with a child
in kindergarten,

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.530
or when talking to your
doctor, for example.

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:28.130
Or when labeling these columns.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:31.980
Copulation, for example,
is not a profane word.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.820
So there must be something
else about the words that

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.480
makes them offensive to people.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.350
And the first thing that
people oftentimes come up with

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:42.020
is the length of the word.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.940
Something about how the word
sounds or how it's spelled.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:50.090
We have this idea in English
that there's something special

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:51.820
about four-letter words, right?

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.744
And in fact, if you
look empirically

00:07:53.744 --> 00:07:55.410
at the distribution
of four-letter words

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:57.830
among profane words
compared to what

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:00.410
you'd expect on the basis of
the distribution in the language

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:02.810
in general, you
do find that there

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:06.180
are far more profane
four-letter words than you

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.370
would expect by chance.

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:09.940
And that's true even if you
normalize for the frequency

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:11.809
of profane words.

00:08:11.809 --> 00:08:13.350
But you find something
else, as well.

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:15.840
It's not just four-letter
words that are more frequent.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.271
It's also three-letter
words, and five-letter words,

00:08:18.271 --> 00:08:19.270
and eight- letter words.

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:21.840
And all those differences
turn out to be significant.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:26.190
So what's special about
three-, four-, five-,

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:27.935
and eight-letter words?

00:08:27.935 --> 00:08:29.810
Well, it has something
to do-- if you go back

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:32.130
and look at these
words, you can actually

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:34.100
start to see the pattern.

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.970
The eight-letter
words are made up

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:38.760
of two four-ish letter words.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.549
And the four- and five-
and three-letter words

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:44.300
oftentimes sounds
pretty similar.

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.944
They may be spelled
with five letters,

00:08:46.944 --> 00:08:49.360
but that doesn't mean that
they have five distinct sounds.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.480
In fact, this is an artifact
of English orthography

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.020
being terrible.

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:58.160
So English spelling doesn't
look at all like how it sounds.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.590
It's unlike rational
languages-- like Spanish,

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:04.970
for example, or Indonesiann--
that actually do have a one

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:09.190
character per sound dictate.

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:10.530
Well, in English, not so much.

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:14.690
And so in fact, what's going
on with these three- and four-

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:17.240
and five-letter words is
that English profane words

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.250
tend to follow a
particular sound pattern.

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:23.190
And that sound pattern is this.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:26.010
English syllables
come in two varieties.

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:28.400
There are the ones that
have consonants at the end,

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.460
and the ones that have
no consonants at the end.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.070
And that makes a big
difference for lots of stuff

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:33.350
that linguists care about.

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:36.030
The thing that you should
care about with respect

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:39.970
to this distinction is
that English profane words

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:44.850
are far more likely to end with
consonants at the end-- they

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.080
fall into this
category over here--

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:50.560
than they are to have no
spoken consonants at the end.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:54.410
And you could come up with
maybe five words in English

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:57.650
that are arguably profane
that show up on these lists

00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:01.490
across languages that
people find to be offensive.

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:05.510
And they're really mostly
not that bad, right?

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:10.770
So poo is not the strongest
word in the English language.

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:12.200
Nor is pee, screw.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.570
Jew shows up on some lists.

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:16.410
I think it's the use
of Jew as a verb.

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:18.740
So to Jew someone, or
to Jew someone down

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:21.300
that is judged to be offensive.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:25.070
So there's not a lot of
profane vocabulary in English

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:27.820
that ends with no consonants.

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.414
Almost all of it
ends with consonants.

00:10:29.414 --> 00:10:31.580
And this differs from the
language in general, which

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:35.160
is far more evenly balanced
when you look at nouns or verbs

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.480
or frequent words,
infrequent words in general.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.450
This is a very
strange distribution

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:41.970
for the sounds of words.

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:45.320
And so you look at
this distribution.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:49.856
And this might start to explain
part of why certain words are

00:10:49.856 --> 00:10:52.480
judged to be more offensive than
others, even though they might

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.920
come from the same
meaning source.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.240
But is this just a
pattern in the lexicon?

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.730
Is this just a
distributional fact?

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:02.550
Or is this something
that's actually

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:04.610
active in the minds
of English speakers?

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:06.690
Is this something
that you bring to bear

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:08.480
when you're exposed to a word?

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.740
Do you have this
pattern in mind?

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.700
Does this template
apply to a new word

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:13.900
that you're exposed to?

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:16.770
Well, in order to ask this
question, what we did was

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:20.250
we invented some new words.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:23.890
We invented words that didn't
actually exist in English,

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:27.720
but that were equally
likely to exist

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.310
in English, that had sequences
of sounds or sequences

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:33.960
of letters that are coherent
with how English works,

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.430
but just don't happen to exist.

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:43.140
So we made up words like
"ver" and "verd" and "stee"

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.420
and "steet."

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:46.670
And we asked people to
make various judgments

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:48.110
about these words.

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:49.640
How much does it
sound like a word?

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.770
And also, by the
way, how likely do

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:53.890
you think this word
is to be profane?

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:55.945
And this is what they said.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.970
So we had some words that
started with just one consonant

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:02.770
at the beginning.

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:03.310
Those are these.

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:05.420
And then, some that started
with s plus a consonant,

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:07.560
because that's a nice way
to build more consonants

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.910
into the beginnings of words.

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:12.410
And so you see two statistically
significant effects here,

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:13.230
two main effects.

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:16.790
The first is that if
you have two consonants

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:19.510
at the beginning, you're going
to be judged more profane.

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:21.440
That is, higher bars
than if you have only one

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.565
consonant at the beginning.

00:12:22.565 --> 00:12:24.510
These two bars are higher
than these two bars.

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.800
And then, the second effect
is that the dark bars

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.500
are higher than the gray bars.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:32.720
And that's showing that if you
have a consonant at the end,

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.510
you're judged to be more profane
than if you have no consonant,

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:37.160
spoken consonant, at the end.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.440
And that's true.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.550
Those two effects are
independent of one another.

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:44.380
So it appears to
be that people have

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:46.910
this template in their
minds, this expectation

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:50.430
that profane words are going
to sound a particular way.

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.190
And when exposed to a brand-new
word, they bring that to bear.

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:55.890
Now, this is not
particularly surprising

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:59.180
if you've ever watched
people invent new words.

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:02.170
So consider the case of fiction.

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:06.130
So when you have a fictitious
language, say Klingon

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:09.070
or Dothraki, and
you have to come up

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:12.660
with what is the profane
inventory going to be like,

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:14.310
without exception,
English speakers

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:19.450
make up words that follow this
heavy consonant at the end

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:21.390
pattern.

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:24.300
Moreover, when people
invent new profane words--

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:25.870
and this is happening
all the time--

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:28.700
those words overwhelmingly
follow this same pattern.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:32.710
So I have the privilege of
teaching at UC San Diego, where

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:35.460
I'm able to consult
on a near daily basis

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:38.000
with undergraduate students
who are aged 18 to 22.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.030
And they know all kinds
of things about language

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:42.110
and how it's changing
that I do not know.

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:44.780
And they bring in new words.

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:47.220
One of the things that I
ask them is to surprise me,

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:50.770
tell me something that I don't
know about how people are using

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:52.730
language in your community.

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:54.610
And what you find
is that there is

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:59.490
a whole host of new profane
words with every new crop

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:00.140
of students.

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:04.310
So you might not have heard
the word "sperg" before.

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:05.980
This is a term of
abuse for people

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:08.070
with Asperger's syndrome.

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:11.010
You might have heard
the word "tard" before.

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:13.020
This is an abbreviation
for retard.

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:15.600
This is judged by
young adults to be

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.500
one of the most offensive words
in the language, more offensive

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:21.840
than the F word.

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.600
The word MILF, the word
GILF, which is a new one

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.980
that I hadn't heard before.

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:31.660
So there's a variety of new
words, which, not surprisingly,

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.130
if people have this
pattern in their minds,

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:39.220
follow this heavy consonant
at the end syllable pattern.

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:42.060
Now, why do English profanities
tend to sound like this?

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:44.420
Well, there are a couple
of possible explanations.

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:46.996
It could be that at some
point in the previous history

00:14:46.996 --> 00:14:48.370
of the language,
it just happened

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:50.870
to be the case that a
bunch of profane words

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:52.220
sounded like that.

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.930
And then, over the course
of history, people-- as they

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:56.630
invented new words--
tended to invent

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:59.402
words that sounded like
the ones that they already

00:14:59.402 --> 00:15:00.360
knew that were profane.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.820
They sort of snowballed.

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:03.890
You had this
accretion by the rich

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:05.670
getting richer sort of process.

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:07.180
That's certainly possible.

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:09.040
But it's also
possible that there's

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:13.740
some reason to the rhyme,
if you will, that-- that's

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:20.470
a linguist joke, by the way--
that there's a specific reason

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:22.470
why this particular pattern.

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:25.570
Now, when children start
to acquire a language,

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:28.630
the early sounds that
they're able to produce

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:33.800
are in conformity
with certain patterns.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.930
One thing that's very
hard for them to do

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:38.530
is to produce a bunch of
consonants, especially

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:40.120
at the end of a syllable.

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.870
Childlike language
tends to reduce

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:43.980
syllables to just a
consonant and a vowel,

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:46.240
and often repeats if anything.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:49.530
So it's possible
that these words

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:51.310
are tailored to be
the type of thing that

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:53.640
sounds least childlike.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:56.220
Not because then children
can't produce it, but just

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.780
for the mouthfeel
of the word, it

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:01.650
feels unlike the type
of thing that a child

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:02.650
would be likely to say.

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:05.190
And it also sounds
unlikely to be something

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:06.870
that a child would say.

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:09.450
A final possibility is that
it might have something

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:12.930
to do with the use that
you put these words to.

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:15.090
And I first started
thinking about this

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:18.150
when I saw interviews with
people with Tourette syndrome.

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:20.440
Now, you may or may not
be familiar with Tourette

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.000
syndrome.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.080
It's an inhibitory
control disorder where--

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.770
it's a developmental disorder.

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:28.740
People have trouble
controlling tics,

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:32.000
which are movements usually of
the head and neck, sometimes

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:32.900
the upper torso.

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:37.300
About 10% of the time, they
also have a particular symptom

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:41.000
known as coprolalia, which is
the uncontrollable production

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.750
of taboo words.

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:45.730
And it so happens that
when you ask people

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:48.430
how they control
this coprolalia,

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:51.270
they often report
that what they do

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:54.610
is they can't control the
beginning of the word.

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:56.860
So one person I saw
interviewed, for example,

00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:58.940
said that his tic
was the word "cock."

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:01.217
So he couldn't
not say that word.

00:17:01.217 --> 00:17:02.050
He would be at work.

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:02.966
He would be in public.

00:17:02.966 --> 00:17:04.890
He'd be at a ball
game with his kids,

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:07.490
and he just couldn't
not say that word.

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:10.690
But he could change
the end of the word.

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:13.470
He could just close his mouth.

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:15.339
So "cop," and so
his solution was

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:17.250
to say "cop," cop,
cop, cop, cop.

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:20.876
And he described the effect
as being that people thought

00:17:20.876 --> 00:17:22.250
that he was a
little bit strange,

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:24.900
but certainly it didn't
have the consequence of him

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:27.319
not being able to go
out in public anymore.

00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:31.180
And so it occurs to me
that one of the things

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:33.990
that having a bunch of
consonants at the end does

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:35.060
is it stops the word.

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.390
So if what you want
to do with profanity

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:39.530
is to express a strong
emotion and then

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:44.249
be able to quickly curtail the
audibleness of that expression,

00:17:44.249 --> 00:17:45.790
then maybe it would
be useful to have

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:48.164
something at the end that's
not a vowel, but a consonant.

00:17:48.164 --> 00:17:50.790
And there's a little bit
of corroborating evidence

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:51.700
for this.

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:54.450
The consonants that you can
stick at the end of a word

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:57.690
are not all equal in their
ability to stop sound.

00:17:57.690 --> 00:17:59.730
There are some called
stop consonants,

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:02.380
like puh, and tuh, and
kuh, that really do just

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:04.660
stop the sound coming
out of your mouth.

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:06.590
And if those are
the ones that are

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:09.040
most likely to occur at
the ends of profane words,

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.190
then this is consistent
with that explanation.

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:15.380
And in fact, if you count all
English monosyllabic words,

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:18.360
and you look at the
ending consonants,

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.910
there are about as many stop
consonants, like puh, tuh, kuh,

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:22.354
as there are nonstop consonants.

00:18:22.354 --> 00:18:23.770
That's in the
language in general.

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:26.980
But if you look just at profane
English monosyllabic words,

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.320
there are far more stops
than nonstop consonants.

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:34.060
So that's a thing.

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:36.580
Anyway, as you look
across languages,

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:40.521
you find that this sound pattern
doesn't necessarily hold up.

00:18:40.521 --> 00:18:42.020
So there are
languages, for example,

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:46.180
that just don't allow consonants
at the ends of syllables.

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:48.140
So Japanese mostly
doesn't allow consonants

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:51.146
at the ends of syllables
except for "n," but no others.

00:18:51.146 --> 00:18:52.770
Hawaiian mostly
doesn't like consonants

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:53.990
at the ends of syllables.

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:56.080
So in those languages,
you just couldn't have it.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:00.740
If you turn-- well, I'm in San
Diego, so if you turn south,

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:02.490
you find that Spanish
doesn't really

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:04.080
have this pattern, either.

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:08.120
Most words in Spanish
that are nouns or verbs,

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:11.570
adjectives, adverbs are
multi-syllable words.

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:13.870
So you don't really get
one-syllable profanity

00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:14.370
in Spanish.

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:15.786
So there are
certainly differences

00:19:15.786 --> 00:19:17.540
across the world's languages.

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:19.150
So more to be explored here.

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:23.540
But you certainly see that
across the world's languages,

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:26.980
there is a tendency to have
something like profanity drawn

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:29.180
from one of these
four categories,

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:31.530
having certain sound
patterns, although maybe not

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:33.290
these specific sound patterns.

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:37.180
And there are few exceptions to
the fact of having profanity.

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:38.860
But there are exceptions.

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:42.280
So in some languages, or in
some cultures, I should say,

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:43.720
there's not even a setting.

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:45.890
There's not even a
pervasive cultural belief

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:47.990
that there's a set
of words that we all

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:51.510
agree are the bad words that
we shouldn't say in public,

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:54.100
we shouldn't say around kids,
we shouldn't allow kids to say,

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:57.536
that need to be bleeped, that
people should be punished for.

00:19:57.536 --> 00:19:59.160
So for example, it's
long been reported

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.040
that this is the case in Japan.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:05.220
So there isn't this
sort of social setting

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:09.740
that there is a set of words
that we need to make sure

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:11.940
that kids are protected from.

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:16.784
So there are lots of ways to
insult people in Japanese.

00:20:16.784 --> 00:20:18.950
There are lots of ways to
offend people in Japanese.

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:21.110
You can insult
people's ancestors

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:22.560
and liken them to animals.

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.190
That is a really
offensive thing to do.

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:26.650
You can call people ignorant.

00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:31.190
You can use the wrong honorific
forms, those little endings

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:32.965
on the ends of
verbs and nouns that

00:20:32.965 --> 00:20:35.340
make it seem like you're
talking to someone of low status

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:37.530
rather than high status.

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:42.140
But specific words that
are bad words, not so much.

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:44.340
If you want to say that
someone's-- if you want

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:47.640
to insult someone, you
might use the word baka.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:50.800
To talk about genitalia,
you might use chinchin.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:54.721
Some people say that kuso,
which literally means excrement,

00:20:54.721 --> 00:20:57.220
is the closest thing that there
is to profanity in Japanese.

00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:59.660
But you see it in
Hello Kitty videos.

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:03.410
I mean, it clearly
doesn't rise to the level

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:08.810
of even "shit," which as we
saw, doesn't break the top 30.

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:14.480
So across the world's
languages, the idea of profanity

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:17.480
is actually built off of
something a little bit more

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:21.750
than just having words
belonging to certain domains

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:22.930
of experience.

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:25.952
And more than just having
words that sound powerful,

00:21:25.952 --> 00:21:26.910
there's something else.

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:28.810
There's a cultural setting.

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:31.800
And what we find when we look
within a culture across time

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.580
is that you get the
exact same effect.

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:35.860
That over the course
of the history

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:39.830
of a language, a particular word
may enter into being profane.

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:44.670
And then decades or centuries
later may no longer be profane.

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:48.620
So it just so happens that if
you know someone named Dick,

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:51.360
he's probably 65
years old or older.

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.990
And the reason I know
that is that I went and I

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:56.490
dug into the Social Security
Administration naming

00:21:56.490 --> 00:22:01.940
database, which has
records of every live birth

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:03.840
recorded in the United States.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:07.060
And as it turned out, there
was a long period of US history

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:11.171
in which children were being
given the given name Dick.

00:22:11.171 --> 00:22:12.670
Not Richard-- these
weren't Richards

00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:13.520
who were nicknamed Dick.

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:14.790
They were actually named Dick.

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:16.870
It said "Dick" on their
birth certificate.

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:19.030
So what I did was I
just counted over,

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:21.830
on a year by year basis,
how many Dicks there were

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:25.050
and how many Ricks there were.

00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:27.780
And here's the data.

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:30.670
It sort of speaks for itself.

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:34.730
There was a time when
there were lots of Dicks.

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:41.630
And then, by 1965, there
were no more Dicks.

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:45.050
There were Ricks and there were
Richards, but no more Dicks.

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:48.240
And I actually have
a relative named

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:52.530
Richard who was born
right around here

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:54.830
who went by Dick
until the mid-1990s.

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:56.870
And then, we got an
email saying, by the way,

00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:58.000
I'm now going by Rick.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.990
And this is a totally
rational thing to do.

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:01.900
For obvious reasons.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:06.630
This is a word that had
accumulated enough impact

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:09.480
in its secondary meaning, its
new, acquired meaning, which

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:12.130
interestingly seems to
have arisen indirectly

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:15.430
from a meaning relating
to-- so "dick" first

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:19.630
came to mean a riding crop, like
the handle of a riding crop.

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:22.010
You can see how it then would
be metaphorically extended

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:26.210
to a body part that was
maybe shaped similarly.

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:29.910
But that change took
decades to take effect,

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:32.130
to the point where
people started

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:35.930
to decide that other meaning
is just too invasive.

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:38.830
It's just too problematic
when I introduce myself.

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:40.810
And we see this
not just with Dick,

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:42.680
but you can plot
the same history

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:45.350
with a closely
related word, "cock,"

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:50.700
which used to only
refer to the rooster

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.635
before the word
"rooster" existed.

00:23:52.635 --> 00:23:54.640
It then gained a
secondary meaning.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.940
It gained a meaning
relating to, well, actually

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:58.360
the same thing that "dick" did.

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:02.900
And at that point, after
some centuries of discomfort,

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:05.460
Puritanical Americans
in the 18th century

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:08.070
decided this was not a
stable state of affairs.

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:12.030
And they really needed another
way to describe, to call,

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:13.540
the male of the chicken.

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:16.120
And they invented a
word based on the place

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:18.350
that that animal sleeps.

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:20.930
It sleeps in a roost,
so it is a rooster.

00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:27.684
And that word gained familiarity
and use in the United States,

00:24:27.684 --> 00:24:30.100
although it hasn't caught on
in other places in the world.

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:32.110
So you still have, for
example, Great Britain

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:34.276
where "rooster" is sort
of a funny American word

00:24:34.276 --> 00:24:35.150
that they know about.

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:38.080
Kind of like how like
a lorry is for us.

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:41.510
It's like, ha, whatever,
you guys are ridiculous.

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:42.780
It was kind of the same thing.

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:46.270
So what we see across words when
we look at profane vocabulary

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:48.040
is that they follow
this pattern.

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:50.210
That at first, they're
not profane at all.

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:52.350
Refer to animals or to people.

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:54.270
That they gain profane meanings.

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:58.660
That those profane meanings
squeeze out the old meanings,

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:02.510
create an externality of having
to invent new words to cover

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:05.180
the semantic ground that
is now no longer covered

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:08.410
by the word that's not being
used in its original way.

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:11.840
And then, eventually,
these words die out.

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:14.680
So many of the most
profane words from English

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.690
are no longer used.

00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:19.140
So if I were to tell you
that in Shakespeare's time

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:22.610
the equivalent of the
F word was "swive,"

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:25.550
you would only know that if you
were a Shakespearean scholar.

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:27.930
It comes from an old
root meaning something

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:30.580
like to turn or screw.

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:32.630
We have other words
that have followed

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:34.660
a similar semantic pattern.

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:37.910
But it has completely
fallen out of use.

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:42.780
So has "tarnation," and so
has "gadzooks," and "zounds."

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:44.800
These are all words
that, at some point,

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.350
were extremely vulgar.

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:49.460
"Gadzooks" comes
from "God's eyes,"

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:52.440
and it falls into this
religious terminology,

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:53.880
but no longer is used at all.

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:56.650
And so this is the general
pattern that we observe.

00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:59.950
If we are to project
forward, we can reasonably

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:01.920
assume that the very set
of words that are now

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:04.580
judged to be the most offensive
ones in the English language,

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:07.309
within a century
certainly, will no longer

00:26:07.309 --> 00:26:08.600
have the impact that they have.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:11.260
And it would be surprising
if the F word, for example,

00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:16.190
were still censored on broadcast
television in 20 years.

00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:19.370
But at the point at which
there is some ambiguity,

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:22.310
there's ample opportunity
for double entendre.

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:24.620
And so just because this
is a real thing that

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:26.360
actually happened, I
wanted to show this.

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:29.020
So right around
here in the 1960s,

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:31.800
there was a very famous
person whose name was Richard.

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:35.340
And his proponents played
on this double meaning

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:39.940
to create this actual,
real political messaging.

00:26:46.464 --> 00:26:48.380
It's the type of thing
that you could get away

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:53.790
with in 1955 or 1965
because there was still--

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:56.790
because his name
was Dick, right?

00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:59.994
Maybe not the thing that you
could get away with in 2016.

00:26:59.994 --> 00:27:01.160
Or maybe actually you could.

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:03.057
I guess we'll find out
in about three weeks.

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:08.200
OK, so what makes profanity?

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:11.215
Well, there's a whole bunch
that goes into making profanity.

00:27:11.215 --> 00:27:13.300
First, you have to
have a cultural belief

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:15.040
that some words are bad.

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:16.550
And you don't have to have that.

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:20.430
You could be Japanese and not
have that cultural belief.

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:23.550
Second, you have to apply that
belief to specific words, which

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:26.290
are most likely to be drawn from
certain categories of meaning.

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:28.580
And they make a pattern
together in sound.

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:31.670
And then, in order
for that belief system

00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:35.250
to be inserted into
people's brains,

00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:37.950
there has to be some
system for reinforcing it.

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:41.910
So there has to be some system
of punishment, censorship.

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:44.210
Ironically, the
punishment-- the soap

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:47.120
in the mouth, the bleeping
on television-- that

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:50.500
is exactly what makes
those specific words

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:52.050
have the taboos that they have.

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:54.570
It is the thing that
recreates that belief

00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:59.470
system for each new generation
of speakers of the language.

00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:03.440
Now, I wanted to talk to you
not just about what profanity is

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:06.480
and some of the science
of what we know about it,

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:10.810
but also what it uniquely
reveals about our brains.

00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:13.000
And so that's what I
wanted to turn to next.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.450
There are certain
facts about how

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:20.210
profanity is used that differ
from the rest of language.

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:22.070
Profanity is emotional.

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:24.280
It evokes emotions
in other people.

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:26.329
It is inhibited.

00:28:26.329 --> 00:28:27.870
It is the type of
thing that you know

00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:30.150
you're not supposed to say
in certain circumstances.

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:33.597
And as a consequence, it
uses different brain systems

00:28:33.597 --> 00:28:34.680
from the rest of language.

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.130
And I'm going to show you
now two kinds of things

00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:40.660
that we learn about how
our brains compute language

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:45.060
on the basis of
this side effect.

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:47.220
So the first has to
do with speech errors.

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:49.180
Speech is peppered with errors.

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:51.010
I've tried to not
produce many now.

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:53.490
But in fact, people produce
roughly an error every thousand

00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:54.330
words.

00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:55.800
It's a lot.

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:59.070
In particular, it's been
believed for a long time

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:01.890
that the speech errors
may reflect thoughts

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:04.140
that people have that
they are not consciously--

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:06.530
or that they are consciously
trying to suppress.

00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:08.810
And if this is
true, then we might

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:13.110
expect to find that
repressed thoughts produce

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:18.430
more taboo errors than non-taboo
errors, all things being equal.

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:21.490
And certainly, we tend to
notice when people make

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:24.650
speech errors that are vulgar.

00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:27.030
So here are two examples.

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:29.710
This is-- if you watch the
news enough, live news,

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:31.530
you'll get this.

00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:33.817
Examples like this-- I hope
that the audio works here.

See that?

00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:39.290

[LAUGHTER]

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:52.910
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:57.180
BENJAMIN BERGEN: OK,
so these are the ones--

00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:59.090
feel sorry for her, right?

00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:00.340
She probably enjoyed the wine.

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:04.950
But these are the errors
that we notice, of course.

00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:10.610
Because if she said pick a
kick, no one would care, right?

00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:12.310
Wouldn't make a difference.

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:15.530
It doesn't violate a social
expectation about behavior,

00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:18.360
for example, on
broadcast television.

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:19.861
But when you actually
look, when you

00:31:19.861 --> 00:31:22.318
do the controlled experiment,
I won't give you the details.

00:31:22.318 --> 00:31:24.030
But when you create
conditions for people

00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:28.090
to produce errors that are
either taboo errors like those

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:30.530
or neutral errors that don't
produce any taboo language

00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:32.650
at all, what you find-- there
have been a variety of studies

00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:33.150
up.

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:34.660
Showing you the first two.

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:39.420
The data hold up and have
held up for nearly 40 years.

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:41.240
You find that people
are far more likely,

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.320
they make many times
more-- depending

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:46.360
on the study-- they make many
times more neutral errors

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:47.610
than taboo errors.

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:49.740
And that's actually revealing.

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:54.390
Because why would you be
able to avoid making errors

00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:56.940
when the error would be taboo?

00:31:56.940 --> 00:32:00.100
Well, the interpretation,
and the thing

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:02.790
that we've learned about
language and the brain

00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:06.010
from looking at this, these
taboo errors specifically,

00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:12.610
is that in the cases when
there would be the most

00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:15.370
damage to make an error because
it would be a taboo word coming

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:18.110
out, those are the
conditions under which you

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:19.400
avoid making errors.

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:24.070
Which implicates an internal
self-monitoring system.

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:25.740
And there's a whole
bunch of research

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:28.970
that's grown up around this
idea that perhaps when you're

00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:31.930
planning to produce speech, when
you're activating those words

00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:35.450
in some grammatical organization
and you're going to speak them,

00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:37.850
that you do a
little sanity check.

00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:41.000
You run an internal
simulation, an internal model

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.690
of what it's going to be
like to say those words.

00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:46.840
And in the case where
there is something bad

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:49.060
coming down the pike,
you pull the lever

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:50.510
and stop the assembly line.

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:52.300
And we actually know
now, by comparing

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:57.390
cases where people are induced
to make errors that would

00:32:57.390 --> 00:33:02.150
be profane, like "hit shed."

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:05.860
OK, if you switch the
first sounds of "hit shed,"

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:07.157
it would be taboo.

00:33:07.157 --> 00:33:09.740
If you switch the first sounds
of "hit said," it would not be.

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:12.350
So if you compare what
happens in a person's brain

00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:14.560
when they successfully
avoid making

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:17.920
an error on the taboo ones
versus the neutral ones,

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:20.060
you find that this is
the part of the brain,

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:23.930
right here, that's
doing more work,

00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:26.870
avoiding making a taboo error.

00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:28.610
It's a particular part
of the brain known

00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:31.150
as the right inferior
frontal gyrus that's

00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:34.880
part of the system specifically
responsible for, wait for it,

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.390
inhibitory control.

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:39.280
It's responsible for-- you know
when you're sitting at a light,

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:41.910
and it turns green,
and you're about to go.

00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:44.670
And then, all of a sudden, the
light changes-- maybe there's

00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:46.180
a fire truck coming from
the other direction,

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:47.763
and it did that
magical blinking thing

00:33:47.763 --> 00:33:49.170
where it changes the lights?

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:51.700
So your ability to
not do something,

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:55.630
to inhibit the execution
of that action, that's

00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:58.150
what the right inferior
frontal gyrus is implicated in.

00:33:58.150 --> 00:33:59.635
It does it in
general, when you're

00:33:59.635 --> 00:34:00.760
moving around in the world.

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:02.930
And it does it specifically
when you're avoiding

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:04.810
producing profane language.

00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:07.540
And we can see this in
people's behavior, as well.

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:11.060
So people are
suppressing, they're

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:15.469
trying to inhibit producing
profane words in tasks

00:34:15.469 --> 00:34:15.969
like this.

00:34:15.969 --> 00:34:19.190
So this is a task known as
picture word interference.

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:23.460
If you give people a picture
and say, name that picture, what

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:25.889
is this a picture of,
as quickly as possible,

00:34:25.889 --> 00:34:27.310
and measure how
long it takes them

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:29.120
to say what the
name of that thing

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:32.699
is, and then print an
irrelevant word over it,

00:34:32.699 --> 00:34:35.300
you find that as long as the
word doesn't have similarity

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:38.429
in sound or meaning, it doesn't
interfere with naming the word

00:34:38.429 --> 00:34:40.929
or saying the word "dog."

00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:42.679
But what happens
when you give them

00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:46.230
a word that they're
supposed to ignore that they

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:48.770
have more trouble ignoring?

00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:51.969
Well, you find that saying the
word "dog" in this circumstance

00:34:51.969 --> 00:34:56.219
takes people
significantly longer.

00:34:56.219 --> 00:34:59.000
The taboo distractor
slows people down

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.120
to say the word "dog."

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:02.340
And the reason for
that is because they

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:05.510
are activating this
inhibitory control mechanism.

00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:08.360
Their brain is saying don't say
that word, don't say that word.

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:11.607
And it slows down the
production of any word.

00:35:11.607 --> 00:35:13.190
The second major
finding that I wanted

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:14.815
to talk about with
respect to the brain

00:35:14.815 --> 00:35:19.250
has to do with the originators
in the brain, those circuits

00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:21.500
that are responsible
for producing language.

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:23.890
Now, if you've taken an
introductory psychology class,

00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:25.780
or linguistics
maybe even, you will

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:28.260
have learned that in
almost all people,

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:29.810
there are language
centers housed

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:32.620
in the left hemisphere of the
brain specifically responsible

00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:34.550
for particular
language functions.

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:38.520
Broca's area articulates words,
or lines them up, or something.

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:41.880
Wernicke's area is
responsible for word meaning.

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:44.120
Primary auditory cortex
is responsible for hearing

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:47.000
the sounds that then are
interpreted in terms of words.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.460
And there's a lot of
truth to all of this.

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:53.410
The thing is that when
people have damage

00:35:53.410 --> 00:35:55.410
to these different
parts of the brain,

00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:57.830
they have damage to
the specific functions

00:35:57.830 --> 00:36:00.330
that those parts of the brain
are supposed to be involved

00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:02.680
with-- with some exceptions.

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:05.700
And we've known
this for 150 years.

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:09.270
One of the first
scientists to study

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:14.570
the incapacitation of
language due to brain damage,

00:36:14.570 --> 00:36:18.400
known as aphasia, was a
researcher and physician

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.400
known as Jacques Lordat.

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:23.570
He was arguably the founder
of neurolinguistics.

00:36:23.570 --> 00:36:25.132
He was born in 1773.

00:36:25.132 --> 00:36:26.340
He was trained in Montpelier.

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:31.330
And at the age of 52, he
suffered a debilitating stroke.

00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:34.530
And that stroke left him
basically unable to speak.

00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:36.030
But he recovered.

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:39.220
And he began to study people
who had similar conditions, who

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:42.220
had had some sort of brain
damage leading to an inability

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:44.430
to produce language.

00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:47.790
And his most famous case
was a parish priest,

00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:51.430
a man of the cloth who had
a stroke, lost his ability

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:53.810
to speak entirely,
had no ability

00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:56.540
to speak with the
exception of two words.

00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:59.840
And those two words were
the French word "je,"

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:04.670
which means "I" or "me," and
the second was, as Lordat wrote,

00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:06.305
"the most forceful
oath of the tongue,

00:37:06.305 --> 00:37:08.680
which begins with an 'f,' and
which our dictionaries have

00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:10.650
never dared to print."

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:12.620
The French F word starts
with the same letter

00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:16.420
as the English F word,
as if by coincidence.

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:20.650
And so this is now common
knowledge among aphasiologists,

00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:23.150
that people who have
damage to Broca's area

00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:27.760
will lose language in general,
but not necessarily swearing.

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:30.540
Many people who lose the
ability to produce language

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:34.700
in general-- and this is due
to traumatic brain injury,

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:37.160
due to stroke, like
in these cases,

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:39.310
Alzheimer's disease
can cause aphasias,

00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:41.460
as well-- a variety
of different causes

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:44.740
can lead to this same syndrome.

00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:46.930
So patients, for
example, will be

00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:48.630
looking at a picture
of a dog and a cat.

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:50.921
And they're supposed to say
the dog is chasing the cat.

00:37:50.921 --> 00:37:53.050
And they can't say the
dog is chasing the cat.

00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:55.780
So they'll swear.

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:57.940
The most extreme
example is from people

00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:00.840
who, for medical
reasons, had to have

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:03.100
their entire left
hemisphere removed.

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:07.650
So the most convincing case
is a patient known as EC.

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:10.710
He was 47 years old,
right-handed man, left

00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:12.090
lateralized for language.

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:16.390
And he had severe symptoms from
a substantial left hemisphere

00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:18.740
tumor on his frontal lobe.

00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:20.870
So over Broca's area.

00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:23.800
The tumor was removed but was
determined to be malignant.

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:29.300
And so his doctors decided to
remove the entire hemisphere,

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:31.360
a radical left hemispherectomy.

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:34.800
And so what happened?

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:37.370
What happened in the
case of his language?

00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:39.650
Well, this is what happened
according to his doctor,

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:44.460
after his entire left hemisphere
was removed at the age of 47.

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:45.990
"His attempts to
reply to questions

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:50.370
immediately after operation
were totally unsuccessful.

00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:52.580
He would open his mouth
and utter isolated words,

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:54.730
and after apparently
struggling to organize words

00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:57.670
for meaningful speech,
recognized his inability

00:38:57.670 --> 00:39:00.380
and would utter expletives or
short emotional phrases like

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:04.140
'god damn it.' Expletives and
curses were well articulated

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:07.230
and clearly understandable."

00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:08.660
Doesn't have
language except when

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:12.540
he's swearing due
to frustration, due

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:14.300
to strong emotional states.

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:17.800
Now, what could possibly be
the part of the brain that

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:23.670
can support language, support
emotional communication

00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:25.660
if the entire left
hemisphere is removed?

00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:29.970
Well, we know because
of specific case studies

00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:30.580
like this one.

00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:35.370
So this is the case of a
particular individual who

00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:40.139
is a bilingual French Hebrew
speaker, 75 years old,

00:39:40.139 --> 00:39:40.680
right-handed.

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:42.330
He had a stroke.

00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:48.100
And after his stroke,
he was unable to swear.

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:51.230
All of his language was
preserved, except for swearing

00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:52.650
and a couple of other things.

00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:55.610
He could not provide
the correct expletive

00:39:55.610 --> 00:39:59.190
for situations described to him,
nor could he complete a curse.

00:39:59.190 --> 00:40:01.500
Now, if you know people who
speak French or people who

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:05.077
speak Hebrew, this is an
absolutely strange state

00:40:05.077 --> 00:40:06.535
of affairs not to
be able to curse.

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:11.660
And so here's the payoff.

00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:14.030
Where did this
particular subject,

00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:15.670
this particular
patient, where did he

00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:17.430
have brain damage
from his stroke?

00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:20.590
He had damage in the right
hemisphere of his brain

00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:23.420
in a place called
the basal ganglia.

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:27.800
And basal ganglia are a
part of the limbic system,

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:30.250
which is responsible
for emotion regulation.

00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:32.040
The basal ganglia
in particular seem

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:35.720
to be responsible for deciding
what actions to perform

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:37.990
and what actions to not
specifically perform

00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:40.640
on the basis of an
emotional state.

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:43.110
So I'm angry, should
I fight or flight?

00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:44.649
I'm angry, should
I say something?

00:40:44.649 --> 00:40:45.690
If so, what should I say?

00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:46.780
That sort of thing.

00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:48.285
Or should I not say
anything at all.

00:40:48.285 --> 00:40:50.160
That appears to be what
the basal ganglia do.

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:53.510
And so it appears that we
have a second system that

00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:55.500
can produce vocalizations.

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:57.500
And there's some
corroborating evidence again

00:40:57.500 --> 00:40:59.666
from Tourette's syndrome,
which I mentioned earlier.

00:40:59.666 --> 00:41:01.695
When people have
coprolalia, it can

00:41:01.695 --> 00:41:04.070
be through Tourette syndrome,
but other sorts of diseases

00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:06.372
produce it, as well.

00:41:06.372 --> 00:41:07.830
When you have
coprolalia, these are

00:41:07.830 --> 00:41:13.080
the types of words that you
are unable to suppress saying.

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:16.110
They look a lot like the first
list that we saw, in fact.

00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:19.780
And what brain mechanisms are
impaired in Tourette syndrome?

00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:22.300
That's right--
the basal ganglia.

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:24.210
Basal ganglia are
different in people

00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:26.790
who have developmental
Tourette syndrome than people

00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:28.729
who are neurotypical.

00:41:28.729 --> 00:41:31.020
So what we learned from this
is that there are actually

00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:33.760
multiple vocalization
pathways in humans.

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:36.070
There's one pathway,
the one over here on you

00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:40.160
your left that's in
blue, that doesn't really

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:44.910
involve all these smart
evolutionarily new cortical

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:47.700
systems that we think are
the things that evolved

00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:49.230
that allow us to do language.

00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:52.050
Instead, this system
is a sort of a shortcut

00:41:52.050 --> 00:41:53.860
that we share with
other mammals.

00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:56.400
And in fact, even
other vertebrates.

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:59.030
It's a system for vocalizing
that other primates,

00:41:59.030 --> 00:42:01.690
for example, use when
they're expressing fear

00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:05.790
or identifying a predator
that's in their environment.

00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:08.860
On the other side in
red, you have the system

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:12.340
that is our new system.

00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:14.920
So we have two
capacities for language.

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:18.410
One for reflexive automatic
emotional language,

00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:21.090
and another for rational
cerebral intentional

00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:23.430
communication of ideas.

00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:27.530
And again, we wouldn't know
about this binary system

00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:29.210
of pathways, these
two pathways, if it

00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:31.650
weren't for profane language.

00:42:31.650 --> 00:42:34.140
So profanity works differently
from the rest of language.

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:35.160
It sounds different.

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:36.650
It changes
differently over time.

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:38.900
It's processed
differently in the brain.

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:40.820
There are significant
gains to be

00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:43.620
made in the science of language
by looking at profanity.

00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:47.020
But first, we have to overcome
the stigmas associated

00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:50.580
with these most powerful
words of our language.

00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:53.090
I'd like to thank you now,
and then welcome any questions

00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:53.730
that you have.

00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:54.916
Thanks a lot.

00:42:54.916 --> 00:42:56.256
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:01.792 --> 00:43:05.110
AUDIENCE: I was curious, what
is the most long or complicated

00:43:05.110 --> 00:43:05.652
profane word?

00:43:05.652 --> 00:43:08.193
BENJAMIN BERGEN: The longest or
most complicated profane word

00:43:08.193 --> 00:43:09.350
is surely one in German.

00:43:09.350 --> 00:43:11.731
But so German speakers,
help me out here.

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:21.329
So in English, I don't know.

00:43:21.329 --> 00:43:23.370
So there is a lot of
productive use of profanity.

00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:24.995
There are a lot of
these parts of words

00:43:24.995 --> 00:43:27.850
that you can add on to other
parts to make bigger ones.

00:43:27.850 --> 00:43:29.360
I couldn't hazard a guess.

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:32.410
But I would guess it would be
in a language like German that

00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:34.160
creates words out of
lots of little bits.

00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:35.890
And so it probably has
something to do with--

00:43:35.890 --> 00:43:37.540
AUDIENCE: But they're
all sort of compounded.

00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:38.640
BENJAMIN BERGEN: That's right,
they would be compound words.

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:38.900
Yeah, sure.

00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:39.608
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:43:39.608 --> 00:43:40.750
BENJAMIN BERGEN: Yeah.

00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:42.210
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for your talk.

00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:47.830
Is there any difference
between taboo words

00:43:47.830 --> 00:43:53.110
versus like explicative
curse words?

00:43:53.110 --> 00:43:56.830
So in the former sense,
where it's more thought out,

00:43:56.830 --> 00:43:59.770
methodical to insult somebody's
ancestor or something

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:01.730
like that, and
the latter being I

00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:03.280
want to just get my emotion out?

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:06.240
BENJAMIN BERGEN: So you can
ask people about their feelings

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:08.590
about words, and you can
get some dissociations

00:44:08.590 --> 00:44:11.380
between the following
two questions.

00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:13.990
How offensive is this
word to you personally?

00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:15.140
How offensive is it?

00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:19.060
Versus, how taboo do you
think it is in the culture?

00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:20.710
And there are some
words that differ.

00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:24.780
And you find interesting
differences in, for example,

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:28.000
across genders.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.250
There are certain words
that, for example, women

00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:32.350
will find very
offensive, but not

00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:35.330
judge to be that
taboo, and vice versa,

00:44:35.330 --> 00:44:38.220
that men don't seem to have
the same sensitivity to.

00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:40.790
So those two things do
certainly dissociate.

00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:46.060
And in fact, if you
look at the words that

00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:48.510
are produced during
coprolalia, they're

00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:53.080
actually more properly
described as taboo than profane.

00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:56.290
And the reason that I say that
is when you look at coprolalia

00:44:56.290 --> 00:45:03.170
in Japan, where they just don't
have that set of profane words,

00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:05.650
the words that come out are
often words describing-- they

00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:08.600
can be childlike words
for bodily functions

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:13.310
or for sex organs,
or words describing

00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:16.780
visual characteristics of a
person, like fat, or dark,

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:19.420
or whatever it is that they're
not supposed to be saying

00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:21.670
about how another person looks.

00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:26.720
Those are taboo acts of
talking, even if the word itself

00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:28.630
isn't offensive.

00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:30.570
So yeah, the two do
kind of disassociate.

00:45:30.570 --> 00:45:33.920
AUDIENCE: When you say we
have this secondary mechanism

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:37.060
in language, has a
different pathway,

00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:40.660
how does that then work with
the Japanese, for example?

00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:41.880
BENJAMIN BERGEN: Yeah.

00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:45.320
AUDIENCE: You mentioned that
there's almost no words there.

00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:48.410
And then, my second
question is, what

00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:52.280
would be the difference then of
you saying "go fuck yourself,"

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:54.354
versus like, "go
copulate yourself?"

00:45:54.354 --> 00:45:55.770
BENJAMIN BERGEN:
Ah, what would be

00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:58.110
the difference in terms of the
brain mechanism underlying it?

00:45:58.110 --> 00:45:58.420
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:58.420 --> 00:45:59.503
BENJAMIN BERGEN: Yeah, OK.

00:45:59.503 --> 00:46:02.690
So we don't know what happens in
the brains of Japanese speakers

00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:06.420
when they do whatever is
most closely equivalent.

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:09.560
We do know that if you
take people, run them

00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:13.250
through an fMRI machine and have
them either swear or produce

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:17.390
minced oaths-- so
not fuck, but frick.

00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:21.290
Not shit, but shoot--
you don't get anything

00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:25.070
like the same sort of
limbic system activation.

00:46:25.070 --> 00:46:30.249
So in English speakers,
those alternates don't count.

00:46:30.249 --> 00:46:32.290
We don't know what happens
with Japanese speakers

00:46:32.290 --> 00:46:33.710
when they use
words that are kind

00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:35.410
of equivalent to the
minced oaths that

00:46:35.410 --> 00:46:38.000
are kind of like, aw, darn.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.360
It's possible that something--
it could go either way.

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:44.016
Empirical question.

00:46:44.016 --> 00:46:45.890
But we know that the
physiology is different.

00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:49.980
So when you expose people
to strong profane words,

00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:53.870
it triggers this fight
or flight response,

00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:55.850
this sympathetic
nervous system response

00:46:55.850 --> 00:47:00.160
where adrenaline starts pumping,
heart rate increases, blood

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:02.720
flows to the extremities,
pupils dilate,

00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:07.390
you get narrowed vision,
and you're ready to react.

00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:09.160
That doesn't work
for Japanese speakers

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:12.850
with the pseudo-profanities
that you could use things,

00:47:12.850 --> 00:47:14.235
things like kuso and so on.

00:47:14.235 --> 00:47:16.360
So there's good reason to
believe that their brains

00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:17.990
probably don't do that thing.

00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:20.100
Now, their brains would
do that for other sorts

00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:21.970
of emotional vocalizations.

00:47:21.970 --> 00:47:26.266
So I imagine that when sumo
wrestlers do their yelling

00:47:26.266 --> 00:47:27.890
at each other thing,
there's probably--

00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:30.450
and if it's emotional for them--
they're probably activating

00:47:30.450 --> 00:47:32.640
that vocalization circuit.

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:35.155
It's not language, but it's
kind of that same thing.

00:47:35.155 --> 00:47:36.530
AUDIENCE: I guess
what I'm asking

00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:39.410
is, if they would drop
a brick on their toe,

00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:41.247
right, you'd say a word here.

00:47:41.247 --> 00:47:43.330
BENJAMIN BERGEN: Yeah,
it's an empirical question.

00:47:43.330 --> 00:47:44.850
Like I said, we just don't know.

00:47:44.850 --> 00:47:46.558
If they were just to
vocalize something--

00:47:46.558 --> 00:47:48.600
AUDIENCE: Isn't there a
reaction, even nonverbal?

00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:50.766
BENJAMIN BERGEN: Yeah, yeah,
verbal stuff comes out.

00:47:50.766 --> 00:47:52.270
It's just not profanity per se.

00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:54.830
So it's either nonlinguistic,
like the equivalent

00:47:54.830 --> 00:47:59.144
of "ow," or it's stuff that
is the equivalent of "darn."

00:47:59.144 --> 00:48:00.560
And so yeah, what
we don't know is

00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:03.289
what's happening in the
brain in the latter case.

00:48:03.289 --> 00:48:04.330
You had another question?

00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:05.360
It was--

00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:08.190
AUDIENCE: The difference
between "go fuck yourself"

00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:09.660
and "go copulate yourself."

00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:10.743
BENJAMIN BERGEN: Oh, yeah.

00:48:10.743 --> 00:48:12.880
Well, for sure, a
huge difference.

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:16.690
So the second has to be
computed compositionally

00:48:16.690 --> 00:48:20.235
through that left hemisphere's
system of cortical operations.

00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:26.210
"Go fuck yourself" could
actually happen either way.

00:48:26.210 --> 00:48:27.400
You could be
deliberately calculating,

00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:29.380
how am I most going
to needle this person?

00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:32.880
Like, what is the word
that is most likely to get

00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:34.187
this person riled up?

00:48:34.187 --> 00:48:35.520
To get under this person's skin?

00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:37.490
I'm going to say,
"go fuck yourself."

00:48:37.490 --> 00:48:41.410
You could calculate that
entirely rationally,

00:48:41.410 --> 00:48:42.780
cortically.

00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:46.010
Or it could be produced
via hot cognition.

00:48:46.010 --> 00:48:47.947
So that actually has
two ways to produce it,

00:48:47.947 --> 00:48:49.530
which is the really
interesting thing.

00:48:49.530 --> 00:48:51.992
It's not that profanity is
just generated one place

00:48:51.992 --> 00:48:54.200
and the rest of language is
generated somewhere else.

00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:58.650
It's that for a particular
biological purpose,

00:48:58.650 --> 00:49:02.180
you have one way to generate
the exact same words that you

00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:04.532
can generate through a
different assembly line.

00:49:04.532 --> 00:49:06.240
AUDIENCE: I think it's
really interesting

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:11.740
to hear about the side of the
speaker, like why people cuss

00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:12.790
or why they swear.

00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:14.890
Like, it seems like
it's like a release

00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:17.850
almost in terms of trying
to get those emotions out,

00:49:17.850 --> 00:49:19.130
like you said.

00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:20.920
But I'm wondering,
have you done studies

00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:24.220
on the other side, the recipient
side of people in the room

00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:25.600
with you if you swear?

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:27.920
Like just this
morning in a meeting,

00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:30.680
someone said this swear
word, and everyone broke out

00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:31.240
laughing.

00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:34.270
And I find that to be
a common occurrence.

00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:39.720
And I wonder, why
does that happen?

00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:42.280
Do people swear to get
that kind of reaction?

00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:44.570
And I think of musical
artists as well,

00:49:44.570 --> 00:49:46.830
like rappers and
hip hop artists.

00:49:46.830 --> 00:49:48.890
But yeah, just want to
get your take on that.

00:49:48.890 --> 00:49:50.431
BENJAMIN BERGEN:
Yes, great question.

00:49:50.431 --> 00:49:54.270
There has been a lot of
descriptive work trying

00:49:54.270 --> 00:49:58.070
to characterize why it is that
people respond differently

00:49:58.070 --> 00:50:00.520
in different contexts
to the same words.

00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:06.282
So why does a set of words,
when produced by a comedian,

00:50:06.282 --> 00:50:07.990
you've decided to go
watch that comedian.

00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:10.920
You know that he works--
or she-- works blue.

00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:12.510
You know that it's Allie Wong.

00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:14.630
You know that it's going
to be really vulgar.

00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:15.764
You're prepared for it.

00:50:15.764 --> 00:50:17.430
She could say a set
of things that, when

00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:20.180
produced by, say, a
political candidate,

00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:26.947
would have a totally different
physiological response in you.

00:50:26.947 --> 00:50:29.030
A large part of it has to
do with our expectations

00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:31.930
going in, and particularly of
the social dynamics at play.

00:50:31.930 --> 00:50:35.440
So people use profanity to
cement social relations,

00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:38.680
to demonstrate that this
is an informal situation.

00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:42.550
They use it to be
funny, to break the ice.

00:50:42.550 --> 00:50:44.740
They use it to display power.

00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:48.390
So if I'm the boss,
then I can show

00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:50.740
that I'm the boss because
I can use casual language.

00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:52.110
I can use profanity.

00:50:52.110 --> 00:50:54.635
Whereas the person
who is not the boss

00:50:54.635 --> 00:50:56.760
might not get away with
that same type of language,

00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:00.050
and might be judged
to be-- that person

00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:02.360
might be thought to be
misjudging the situation

00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:03.860
if they think that
they can get away

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:04.860
with using the same language.

00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:06.810
So there's a lot of
social work that people

00:51:06.810 --> 00:51:10.060
do-- not social work, but
social work that people

00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:12.830
do with profanity.

00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:16.390
And we are constantly
calculating

00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:18.810
what we can get
away with and what

00:51:18.810 --> 00:51:20.760
the consequences of
our linguistic actions

00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:22.346
are going to be.

00:51:22.346 --> 00:51:24.580
You know, if you've worked
in a place for a long time

00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:27.020
with a particular set of
people, what the rules are.

00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:28.720
Who's going to be
offended by what?

00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:30.840
And so those are
oftentimes the places

00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:35.060
that people feel most
comfortable using profanity

00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:38.120
to do a variety of things,
like seem funny, break the ice,

00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:40.760
like cement social relations.

00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:43.200
In new situations,
now I'm first day

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:44.960
on the job, that's
probably not going

00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:47.900
to be your go-to because you
haven't taken the temperature

00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:49.300
of the environment yet, right?

00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:52.260
So there's a lot of evidence
that in workplaces, people

00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:55.990
use profanity for lots
of different functions.

00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:58.930
And that, in general,
people who use profanity

00:51:58.930 --> 00:52:02.960
are judged to be more
accessible, more informal,

00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:04.375
and more powerful.

00:52:06.889 --> 00:52:08.430
But depending on
the power structure,

00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:11.410
it could be that they're
judged to be brutish,

00:52:11.410 --> 00:52:16.260
or they could be judged to be
out of touch, or inconsiderate,

00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:17.790
or out of control.

00:52:17.790 --> 00:52:21.800
So again, it's all about--
I'm not a sociologist,

00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:26.015
but it's really about the
social dynamics at play.

00:52:26.015 --> 00:52:28.140
AUDIENCE: What do you feel
about the common process

00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:31.140
of trying to steer children
towards less profane words?

00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:32.620
You know, "shoot" instead of--

00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:35.790
BENJAMIN BERGEN: Yeah, well,
I mean, it totally works

00:52:35.790 --> 00:52:37.287
every time, right?

00:52:37.287 --> 00:52:38.870
Because if I don't
swear, then they're

00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:40.880
just not going to learn it.

00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:41.400
Right, yeah.

00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:44.880
So this is something that
I have thought a lot about.

00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:46.640
Have a two-year-old at home.

00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:49.480
And so this is a
conscious decision

00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:52.440
that you have to make
as an adult around kids.

00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:56.320
You have to decide how
you want to expose them

00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:58.830
to all of these complexities
that we've just been talking

00:52:58.830 --> 00:53:02.136
about, about the social world.

00:53:02.136 --> 00:53:03.784
And it's certainly
the case that there

00:53:03.784 --> 00:53:05.200
are certain types
of language that

00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:06.610
can cause harm to children.

00:53:06.610 --> 00:53:09.140
Verbal abuse, calling
children worthless,

00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:11.160
insulting them,
threatening them.

00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:13.490
That's all stuff that
is known to cause harm.

00:53:13.490 --> 00:53:17.340
Slurs are known to
cause harm in kids,

00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:20.880
so kids in middle school who
are called by homophobic slurs

00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:22.410
report-- in
correlational studies,

00:53:22.410 --> 00:53:24.118
because you can't do
this experimentally,

00:53:24.118 --> 00:53:26.960
obviously-- but they
report increases

00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:29.080
in depression, anxiety,
detachment from school.

00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:31.960
There's lots of stuff
that's not good to have

00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:33.510
around kids linguistically.

00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:36.764
But there's no evidence that
just the fleeting expletive

00:53:36.764 --> 00:53:38.930
because you tripped over a
kiddie gate in the middle

00:53:38.930 --> 00:53:41.540
of the night is the
type of thing that

00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:43.310
will cause harm to a child.

00:53:43.310 --> 00:53:45.520
What will cause
harm to a child is

00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:48.870
if they don't know
that using these words

00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:50.620
in certain
circumstances is going

00:53:50.620 --> 00:53:52.510
to have consequences for them.

00:53:52.510 --> 00:53:55.020
And so there are lots of
ways that you can teach them

00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:56.810
what the consequences
are going to be.

00:53:56.810 --> 00:53:59.600
My preferred method is to
explain what the consequences

00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:01.580
are going to be.

00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:04.567
Kids do a lot of
social learning.

00:54:04.567 --> 00:54:06.650
When you potty train-- I
have a lot of familiarity

00:54:06.650 --> 00:54:08.650
with this-- when you potty
train a two-year-old,

00:54:08.650 --> 00:54:10.050
for example, most
of the learning

00:54:10.050 --> 00:54:12.980
is about there are
certain places and times

00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:16.390
for particular activities, and
lots of other places and times

00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:18.540
that those activities
are inappropriate.

00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:23.070
Like on the couch, or in
the middle of preschool.

00:54:23.070 --> 00:54:25.500
And that's a thing that
a two-year-old can learn.

00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:28.369
And a two-year-old can learn
that this is a language

00:54:28.369 --> 00:54:29.160
that I use at home.

00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:31.480
And I use this other language,
because I'm bilingual,

00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:32.470
at school.

00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:33.450
Kids can learn that.

00:54:33.450 --> 00:54:36.214
And so I don't see any
reason that kids can't also

00:54:36.214 --> 00:54:38.630
learn that this is a word that
Daddy uses when he's upset.

00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:41.010
It's not a bad word, and
Daddy's not bad for using it.

00:54:41.010 --> 00:54:42.070
He's not a bad person.

00:54:42.070 --> 00:54:45.360
But if you use this
word at school,

00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:47.440
expect that some people
might not like it,

00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:49.020
and there might be consequences.

00:54:49.020 --> 00:54:50.240
OK, go ahead and explore.

00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:51.494
Do what you're going to do.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:57.790
That's my general view of
what the literature tells us

00:54:57.790 --> 00:55:00.380
best practices ought to be.

00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:03.610
AUDIENCE: I'm coming at this
from a linguist's direction,

00:55:03.610 --> 00:55:05.310
as I'm sure you know.

00:55:05.310 --> 00:55:08.780
I'm interested in sort of--
it seems like there's even

00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:11.170
from the neural level,
there's kind of two things

00:55:11.170 --> 00:55:12.510
you could be probing.

00:55:12.510 --> 00:55:15.830
There's the things that have
this inhibitory response, which

00:55:15.830 --> 00:55:18.650
I think is really
your core category.

00:55:18.650 --> 00:55:21.180
Those are the
forbidden words, right?

00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:24.850
And you have a constant monitor
to try to prevent yourself

00:55:24.850 --> 00:55:26.170
from producing those.

00:55:26.170 --> 00:55:28.880
And when you do
produce them, you

00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:33.050
have to inhibit the
inhibition, so to speak.

00:55:33.050 --> 00:55:35.050
But then, there's
this other category

00:55:35.050 --> 00:55:39.980
of sort of limbically
produced words, right?

00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:42.730
Are those really
exactly the same?

00:55:42.730 --> 00:55:46.760
Or do words like "ouch" get
used in like left brain removed

00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:47.540
people?

00:55:47.540 --> 00:55:49.030
BENJAMIN BERGEN: Yeah, they do.

00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:50.738
AUDIENCE: That's what
I was going to say.

00:55:50.738 --> 00:55:52.120
There's an exclamative category.

00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:53.230
BENJAMIN BERGEN: Yep,
those exclamatives

00:55:53.230 --> 00:55:54.310
will often be preserved.

00:55:54.310 --> 00:55:55.950
So interjections
are often preserved,

00:55:55.950 --> 00:56:01.100
things like "oh, no," or,
"um, I mean," or "ouch."

00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:03.280
Yeah, those will
oftentimes be preserved

00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:05.540
in Broca's or global aphasia.

00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:06.980
Not always.

00:56:06.980 --> 00:56:07.776
But they often are.

00:56:07.776 --> 00:56:09.900
And they seem to be exactly
what you're describing.

00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:11.360
It's, I'm in an emotional state.

00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:15.271
I'm producing language, uh--
this is going to come out.

00:56:15.271 --> 00:56:17.770
So it seems to be generated by
a different system, for sure.

00:56:17.770 --> 00:56:19.870
AUDIENCE: So as you became
immersed in this work,

00:56:19.870 --> 00:56:23.120
did you find your personal
production rate of expletives

00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:24.120
to increase?

00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:27.269
And if so, what did
you do to fix that?

00:56:27.269 --> 00:56:29.310
BENJAMIN BERGEN: As Nancy
says, it was impossible

00:56:29.310 --> 00:56:30.268
that it could increase.

00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:34.979
Increased, in a
way, because now I'm

00:56:34.979 --> 00:56:36.770
talking about all these
words all the time.

00:56:36.770 --> 00:56:40.079
So it increased in
professional contexts.

00:56:40.079 --> 00:56:41.620
No, if anything, I
think it decreases

00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:43.160
because-- there's this effect.

00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:44.962
As you get exposed
to these words

00:56:44.962 --> 00:56:46.670
over and over and over
and over and over,

00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:48.557
they start to lose their
impact a little bit.

00:56:48.557 --> 00:56:50.640
This is kind of what's
happening with young people

00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:53.550
and the democratization
of media.

00:56:53.550 --> 00:56:55.940
So 20 years ago,
when you only ever

00:56:55.940 --> 00:56:57.760
got exposed to
language and media that

00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:59.606
was filtered
through some censor,

00:56:59.606 --> 00:57:00.980
you didn't hear
these words much.

00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:03.950
Now, the media is
in your pocket,

00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:07.570
and directly from someone's
thumbs to your eyes,

00:57:07.570 --> 00:57:09.370
you get a stream of language.

00:57:09.370 --> 00:57:12.840
And if you're playing
video games, network games

00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:14.960
before breakfast,
you'll get 100 F words

00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:16.800
before you go to school.

00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:19.080
So kids are exposed
to a lot more of this.

00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:21.840
And as a consequence, I think
that's part of the reason that

00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:24.820
you get this consequence, which
is that those run-of-the-mill

00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:27.380
profane words start to
creep down the list.

00:57:27.380 --> 00:57:29.770
The F word isn't judged
to be that bad anymore

00:57:29.770 --> 00:57:32.180
by digital natives.

00:57:32.180 --> 00:57:35.810
So the same has happened to me.

00:57:35.810 --> 00:57:39.030
In a way, these words just don't
really do much for me anymore.

00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:41.850
Sorry, Nancy.

00:57:41.850 --> 00:57:44.316
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for the bad-ass talk.

00:57:44.316 --> 00:57:46.940
So it appears that
repeated exposure decreases

00:57:46.940 --> 00:57:49.230
the impact of profanities.

00:57:49.230 --> 00:57:50.622
So I have one or two questions.

00:57:50.622 --> 00:57:52.580
Depending on your answer
to the first question,

00:57:52.580 --> 00:57:53.910
I might have a second one.

00:57:53.910 --> 00:57:56.680
So the first question is, would
English-speaking societies

00:57:56.680 --> 00:58:00.150
be better off or worse
off if profanities

00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:02.500
just lost their impact, or
disappeared from the language

00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:03.700
somehow?

00:58:03.700 --> 00:58:07.090
BENJAMIN BERGEN: They
would be different off.

00:58:07.090 --> 00:58:09.860
I mean, it would be a
little bit more like France.

00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:12.980
So in France, there
are profane words.

00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:14.710
There are bad words.

00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:16.640
But they're not as
bad as they are here.

00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:22.180
So you don't see them censored
or bleeped on daily television.

00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:25.809
You could see them on the
evening news broadcast.

00:58:25.809 --> 00:58:27.100
You could see them around kids.

00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:28.599
You could see them
produced by kids.

00:58:28.599 --> 00:58:30.890
Even the strongest
words, even that F word

00:58:30.890 --> 00:58:35.435
that our dictionaries have
not seen fit to print-- I

00:58:35.435 --> 00:58:36.810
saw the president
of the republic

00:58:36.810 --> 00:58:38.226
say it on the floor
of the senate.

00:58:40.306 --> 00:58:42.180
So you might end up with
something like that.

00:58:42.180 --> 00:58:44.050
Where yeah, you
can use the words,

00:58:44.050 --> 00:58:47.180
they just have a little
bit less social cachet.

00:58:47.180 --> 00:58:50.490
And so they do a little
bit less emotional work.

00:58:50.490 --> 00:58:52.610
That's what you would
end up with, I think.

00:58:52.610 --> 00:58:55.440
AUDIENCE: OK, so at least we
will unemploy a few censors

00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:58.150
and perhaps have them find
more productive lives.

00:58:58.150 --> 00:59:00.780
So the second question
is as you know,

00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:07.820
Google has made some attempts
at de-radicalizing Muslim

00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:10.060
terrorists by showing
certain [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:12.700
search results when they
search for radical materials.

00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:15.260
So it's a form of
mind influence.

00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:19.240
If you were at Google and
had some control over this,

00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:22.814
what would you do to reduce
the impact of profanities?

00:59:22.814 --> 00:59:24.480
BENJAMIN BERGEN: Well,
you're leading me

00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:27.063
down the path of saying, well,
we should just show more of it,

00:59:27.063 --> 00:59:28.040
right?

00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:29.690
But I think that
what you need to do

00:59:29.690 --> 00:59:37.550
is show it in specifically low
emotional arousal contexts.

00:59:37.550 --> 00:59:40.100
So the reason that we
think these words are bad

00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:45.150
is because early in life, we saw
them used or heard them be used

00:59:45.150 --> 00:59:47.490
in strongly emotional contexts.

00:59:47.490 --> 00:59:48.980
Someone was really frustrated.

00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:52.970
Someone was experiencing
strong pain or was really angry

00:59:52.970 --> 00:59:54.730
or was really excited.

00:59:54.730 --> 00:59:57.370
We used them, and we
got a really strong

00:59:57.370 --> 00:59:59.450
emotional reaction.

00:59:59.450 --> 01:00:01.587
That emotional
substance is what makes

01:00:01.587 --> 01:00:03.170
us think that they
are powerful words,

01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:04.840
and that we have
internalized, we've

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:07.020
associated because
we're Hebbian learners.

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:11.440
And now, we can't help but have
that emotional response when

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:13.000
we're presented with that word.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.980
However, the decontextualized
presentation--

01:00:17.980 --> 01:00:20.360
you see a list of words and
study them over and over

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:24.150
and over, that has no
reinforcing emotional content.

01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:27.090
And so I guess you would
have to, if you really

01:00:27.090 --> 01:00:30.530
wanted to de-escalate the
emotional value of those words,

01:00:30.530 --> 01:00:33.840
they would need to be presented
in unemotional contexts.

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:36.730
So I wouldn't show,
I wouldn't show,

01:00:36.730 --> 01:00:40.440
those words used in strident
political discourse,

01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:46.550
for example, or in other sorts
of highly emotional context.

01:00:46.550 --> 01:00:48.930
I would show them
in lists of words

01:00:48.930 --> 01:00:51.840
or in analysis
context, or some sort

01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:57.574
of really boring, mundane,
anodyne place, I guess.

01:00:57.574 --> 01:00:58.990
But you know, I'm
not an engineer.

01:00:58.990 --> 01:01:00.281
So that probably wouldn't work.
