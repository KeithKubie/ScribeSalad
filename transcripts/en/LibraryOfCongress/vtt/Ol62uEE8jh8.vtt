00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.310
&gt;&gt; An Introduction to BARD Express.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.320
&gt;&gt; Karen Keninger: Hi,
I'm Karen Keninger,

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.400
the Director of the National
Library Service for the Blind

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.170
and Physically Handicapped.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.220
We call it NLS.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.120
I am excited to announce our
latest development, BARD Express.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.200
BARD Express is an application
you use on your personal computer.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.630
BARD Express simplifies
the browsing and searching

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.410
for available talking books and
magazines on the NLS Braille

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.680
and Audio Reading Download
site, known as BARD.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.050
It also manages audio materials
you have downloaded and takes care

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.070
of unzipping and copying
them to a cartridge

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.190
with the click of a button.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.780
The BARD site contains nearly
90,000 books, magazines,

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.900
and instructional music scores
in audio and braille formats,

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.980
and the collection grows every day.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.520
With BARD Express you can search
for audio titles by subject

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.340
and by series, and you can browse
the audio magazine collection

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.570
or the recently added
and most popular lists.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.310
Before you can use BARD Express,
there are three things you need

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.090
to have in place: First, you
must be registered with a Braille

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.800
and talking book library
in the NLS network.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.310
If you aren't registered, but
you think you might qualify

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.660
for this service because you can't
read standard print due to a visual

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.010
or physical disability, check

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:49.850
out the eligibility
requirements at www.loc.gov/nls.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.830
Second, you must establish
a BARD account.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.600
Only registered NLS patrons
are eligible for BARD accounts.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.850
Go to http://NLSBARD.loc.gov

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:11.980
and follow the instructions
to set up your account.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:19.500
And third, you must download
the BARD Express application

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.640
from the BARD website.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.900
It's free and available
to all BARD users.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.520
Next, log into BARD Express with
your BARD user name and password.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.440
You'll only need to do this the
first time you use the application.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.320
BARD Express has ten buttons on
the Main Screen - "Bookshelf,"

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.530
"Wish List," "Preferences," "Manage
Devices," and several browsing

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.600
and searching options
mentioned earlier.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.530 position:56%
Use the search and browse buttons to
locate audio titles you wish to read

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.960
with your digital talking
book machine.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.090
When you find a title that
you want simply select it

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.480
and use the download button
to put it on your bookshelf.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.820 position:56%
From the main menu, choose bookshelf

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.290
and then select the title
that you wish to read.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.360
Then use the copy button to
copy it to the cartridge.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.690
BARD Express does the rest.

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.120
No more unzipping book files.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.810
No more searching for lost
titles on your computer.

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.880 position:56%
BARD Express manages your downloads,

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.320
takes care of unzipping
files downloaded from BARD,

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:43.560 position:56%
and facilitates the transfer of
audio materials to an external drive

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.990
for playing in the digital
talking book machine.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.020
When the transfer is complete,
disconnect your cartridge or drive

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.860
from the computer, insert it

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.690
into your talking book
machine and enjoy your book!

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.670
BARD Express also allows you to
access and download audio titles

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.850
from your personal BARD wish
list using the wish list button.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:13.860 position:56%
Repeat the sequence: select the
title, activate the download button,

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.670 position:56%
return to the Bookshelf, copy to
your cartridge, and enjoy your book.

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.430
The process of searching
for, downloading,

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:28.040
and transferring reading
materials has never been easier!

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:34.490 position:56%
BARD Express works with JAWS,
WindowEyes, and NVDA screen readers.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:40.530
That concludes our overview of the
BARD Express application for PCs.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.490

the various features
