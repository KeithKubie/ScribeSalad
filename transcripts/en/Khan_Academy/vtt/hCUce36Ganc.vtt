00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.849
- [Voiceover] In 1865,
Mendel, often considered

00:00:02.849 --> 00:00:05.228
the father of modern genetics, comes up

00:00:05.228 --> 00:00:06.866
with a structured way of thinking about

00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:10.139
these inheritable factors,
which we now call "genes."

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.310
And then as we go into the early 1900's,

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.040
his work was rediscovered, and people

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.745
started to say, "Okay, we see how some

00:00:16.745 --> 00:00:18.707
"of these traits get passed on in these

00:00:18.707 --> 00:00:20.386
"somewhat predictable ways, we can put

00:00:20.386 --> 00:00:22.058
"some structure around it, but what is

00:00:22.058 --> 00:00:25.318
"the actual biological mechanism for that?

00:00:25.318 --> 00:00:28.468
"How are these traits
encoded at a cellular,

00:00:28.468 --> 00:00:30.268
"or at a molecular level?"

00:00:30.268 --> 00:00:32.996
And so, in 1902, and we talked about this

00:00:32.996 --> 00:00:35.713
in a previous video,
Boveri and Sutton come up

00:00:35.713 --> 00:00:37.537
with the Chromosome Theory, based on

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:40.334
seeing how chromosomes separate and pair

00:00:40.334 --> 00:00:42.245
during cell division, and saying,

00:00:42.245 --> 00:00:44.881
"Hey, those seem to map up quite well

00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:48.445
"to what Mendel described
by these heritable factors."

00:00:48.445 --> 00:00:50.744
Then we start having a lot
more evidence for this.

00:00:50.744 --> 00:00:54.924
Morgan is able to show that a mutant

00:00:54.924 --> 00:00:58.965
eye color trait seems to be passed on

00:00:58.965 --> 00:01:01.473
in a way that shows that it is on

00:01:01.473 --> 00:01:05.105
the X sex chromosome, and he and his team

00:01:05.105 --> 00:01:07.311
start doing a lot more work,
especially with fruit flies,

00:01:07.311 --> 00:01:10.575
to show that, "Hey,
chromosomes are the basis

00:01:10.575 --> 00:01:12.926
"for where these heritable factors are."

00:01:12.926 --> 00:01:14.331
But then even within the chromosomes,

00:01:14.331 --> 00:01:15.684
people weren't sure, chromosomes were made

00:01:15.684 --> 00:01:17.949
up of protein, made up of DNA, what was

00:01:17.949 --> 00:01:20.004
the molecule or the set
of molecules that actually

00:01:20.004 --> 00:01:24.148
encoded for these heritable traits?

00:01:24.148 --> 00:01:26.679
And at first, most of the weight was on

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:30.879
the protein side, because
proteins were these

00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:34.582
complex molecules that
had all of this variety

00:01:34.582 --> 00:01:37.346
that seemed that it could code

00:01:37.346 --> 00:01:41.246
for these heritable traits, while DNA,

00:01:41.246 --> 00:01:43.465
at least early on, seemed like a kind of

00:01:43.465 --> 00:01:47.414
boring molecule, people assumed

00:01:47.414 --> 00:01:50.184
that there wasn't a lot
of diversity in DNA.

00:01:50.184 --> 00:01:51.612
They assumed that even if you go from

00:01:51.612 --> 00:01:54.272
one species to another
that the DNA molecule

00:01:54.272 --> 00:01:56.105
was fundamentally the same.

00:01:56.105 --> 00:01:58.671
So early on, people
actually were on the side

00:01:58.671 --> 00:02:00.448
more of the proteins.

00:02:00.448 --> 00:02:03.827
But then more and more evidence came

00:02:03.827 --> 00:02:06.744
on DNA's side, you had
Griffith's experiment,

00:02:06.744 --> 00:02:08.301
where he was able to
show, "Hey, I could take

00:02:08.301 --> 00:02:11.284
"this heat-killed
bacteria, but if I mix it

00:02:11.284 --> 00:02:13.304
"with some other living
bacteria that somehow

00:02:13.304 --> 00:02:15.162
"there's some transformation principle

00:02:15.162 --> 00:02:18.729
"that transforms the
living bacteria into the

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:21.114
"type of species that I had heat-killed."

00:02:21.114 --> 00:02:23.795
And you go to 1944 and Avery, McCarty,

00:02:23.795 --> 00:02:25.896
and MacLeod are able to
show some pretty good

00:02:25.896 --> 00:02:28.191
evidence that the actual principle,

00:02:28.191 --> 00:02:32.127
the thing that was left in
that heat-killed bacteria,

00:02:32.127 --> 00:02:34.735
was probably DNA.

00:02:36.685 --> 00:02:38.463
And then we get even
more conclusive evidence

00:02:38.463 --> 00:02:40.041
with the experiments of Hershey and Chase

00:02:40.041 --> 00:02:41.504
and we have a whole video on this.

00:02:41.504 --> 00:02:43.304
Where they say, "Hey what is it that

00:02:43.304 --> 00:02:46.288
"viruses inject into bacteria to hijack

00:02:46.288 --> 00:02:49.481
"their genetic system?"

00:02:49.481 --> 00:02:51.117
And they say, "Hey, it's not proteins!

00:02:51.117 --> 00:02:52.626
"It is DNA that does this."

00:02:52.626 --> 00:02:55.007
So they provide much more conclusive

00:02:55.007 --> 00:02:57.120
evidence on the side of DNA.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.779
But even at that point, we as a community,

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:01.207
as a civilization, still didn't know what

00:03:01.207 --> 00:03:03.661
the actual structure of DNA was.

00:03:03.661 --> 00:03:06.136
We also did not know,
how did that structure

00:03:06.136 --> 00:03:09.026
actually code for all of
these heritable factors?

00:03:09.026 --> 00:03:11.987
And the work culminates
with Watson and Crick,

00:03:11.987 --> 00:03:13.565
but it was dependent on all of the people

00:03:13.565 --> 00:03:15.192
I mentioned, and more.

00:03:15.192 --> 00:03:17.164
And one person who
should get special credit

00:03:17.164 --> 00:03:19.126
for, one, getting a
little bit more evidence

00:03:19.126 --> 00:03:21.413
on the side of DNA and helping Watson

00:03:21.413 --> 00:03:23.307
and Crick, actually
there's several people.

00:03:23.307 --> 00:03:25.268
But, in particular, Chargaff,

00:03:25.268 --> 00:03:28.809
and Rosalind Franklin,
and Rosalind Franklin

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:29.993
in particular probably does not get

00:03:29.993 --> 00:03:31.684
as much credit as she deserves.

00:03:31.684 --> 00:03:33.204
Chargaff's the one that showed,

00:03:33.204 --> 00:03:35.050
DNA actually is more interesting than

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.664
people appreciated.

00:03:36.664 --> 00:03:41.448
He noticed that the frequencies

00:03:41.448 --> 00:03:44.632
of the nitrogenous bases of adenine,

00:03:44.632 --> 00:03:47.743
guanine, cytosine, and thymine

00:03:47.743 --> 00:03:51.639
in DNA varies across species.

00:03:56.763 --> 00:03:58.247
And, something that's somehow coding

00:03:58.247 --> 00:04:00.173
for what makes a species a species,

00:04:00.173 --> 00:04:01.926
well, it would have to vary across species

00:04:01.926 --> 00:04:03.656
so that makes DNA interesting.

00:04:03.656 --> 00:04:04.818
And then the other thing that he noticed,

00:04:04.818 --> 00:04:07.569
and this was key for
Watson and Crick's work,

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:11.098
is that the frequency of guanine is equal

00:04:11.098 --> 00:04:13.432
to the frequency of cytosine in DNA,

00:04:13.432 --> 00:04:15.673
and the frequency of adenine is equal

00:04:15.673 --> 00:04:18.274
to the frequency of thymine in DNA.

00:04:18.274 --> 00:04:20.374
And so it's a clue that these somehow

00:04:20.374 --> 00:04:22.801
are associated with
each other, they somehow

00:04:22.801 --> 00:04:24.740
pair with each other.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.120
And so we get to the early '50's.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.583
We had all of this evidence that DNA

00:04:28.583 --> 00:04:30.638
is the molecular basis, you have Chargaff

00:04:30.638 --> 00:04:33.586
with his rules called Chargaff's Rules,

00:04:33.586 --> 00:04:35.978
and then you have Rosalind Franklin,

00:04:40.218 --> 00:04:42.553
and she's imaging diffraction patterns

00:04:42.553 --> 00:04:45.876
from X-rays beamed into crystals of DNA.

00:04:45.876 --> 00:04:47.988
So what I mean by crystal of DNA,

00:04:47.988 --> 00:04:50.450
a crystal is taking a bunch of molecules

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.515
and arranging them in a regular pattern.

00:04:53.515 --> 00:04:56.812
So a crystal of DNA,
that's one DNA molecule,

00:04:56.812 --> 00:04:58.972
then you have another
DNA molecule, and then

00:04:58.972 --> 00:05:01.375
you have another DNA molecule,

00:05:01.375 --> 00:05:02.954
and then you beam X-rays at them,

00:05:02.954 --> 00:05:06.078
and X-rays are key because the wavelength

00:05:06.078 --> 00:05:08.835
of an X-ray is small enough to capture

00:05:08.835 --> 00:05:11.354
the features at an atomic level.

00:05:11.354 --> 00:05:14.223
So you beam X-rays and
then the X-rays diffract.

00:05:14.223 --> 00:05:18.647
And then you capture the
pattern of that diffraction.

00:05:18.647 --> 00:05:20.380
And then depending on the structures

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.681
in the actual molecules you'll have

00:05:21.681 --> 00:05:23.620
different diffraction patterns.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.220
And Franklin's famous diffraction pattern

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.847
is shown right over here, and when she

00:05:27.847 --> 00:05:29.680
immediately saw this, it had some

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.022
of the telltale cues
for a helical structure.

00:05:34.022 --> 00:05:36.054
Now, I wouldn't read too much into this

00:05:36.054 --> 00:05:39.339
if you're not an expert reader of X-ray

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:43.799
diffraction patterns,
this isn't a direct image

00:05:43.799 --> 00:05:47.040
of a DNA molecule, but they knew,

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.538
she already knew and in fact people

00:05:48.538 --> 00:05:50.198
in this community already knew that

00:05:50.198 --> 00:05:54.506
this X pattern was a telltale sign

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:00.317
for a helical structure of some kind,

00:06:00.317 --> 00:06:01.432
and then they were also able to look

00:06:01.432 --> 00:06:04.090
at the other clues here to think about,

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.801
"What's the spacing between
different molecules?"

00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:08.403
And even the spacing between the different

00:06:08.403 --> 00:06:11.015
turns of the helix structure.

00:06:11.015 --> 00:06:13.650
Now once again, this diffraction pattern

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.136
is not a direct image.

00:06:18.636 --> 00:06:20.223
It's a very well-develped expertise

00:06:20.223 --> 00:06:23.125
to backwards map how things will diffract

00:06:23.125 --> 00:06:25.563
into the thing that actually
caused the diffraction.

00:06:25.563 --> 00:06:27.781
And they would take it from multiple

00:06:27.781 --> 00:06:29.278
different angles to get
a better understanding

00:06:29.278 --> 00:06:31.027
of it and actually
today, you have computers

00:06:31.027 --> 00:06:33.058
doing this that could
take a diffraction pattern

00:06:33.058 --> 00:06:36.425
and start to construct what the electron

00:06:36.425 --> 00:06:38.921
clouds of what the actual
molecule looks like.

00:06:38.921 --> 00:06:40.918
So Franklin, this was painstaking work,

00:06:40.918 --> 00:06:43.600
and she already had a sense,

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.097
she knew it was a helical structure but

00:06:45.097 --> 00:06:47.280
she was waiting to get a little bit more

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.300
evidence before she published her work.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.425
Now at the same time, you have Watson

00:06:51.425 --> 00:06:54.885
and Crick here, who were
trying to solve the structure.

00:06:54.885 --> 00:06:57.439
And they got a hold of Franklin's work

00:06:57.439 --> 00:06:59.656
with the help of Maurice Wilkins here,

00:06:59.656 --> 00:07:01.782
who Franklin worked with.

00:07:01.782 --> 00:07:04.202
And they were able to establish

00:07:04.202 --> 00:07:07.193
that it wasn't a single helix,
but it was a double helix.

00:07:07.193 --> 00:07:09.202
And you actually had these base pairs

00:07:09.202 --> 00:07:11.175
forming the rungs of the double helix,

00:07:11.175 --> 00:07:12.696
and that was really interesting because

00:07:12.696 --> 00:07:15.622
that showed how DNA
could replicate itself,

00:07:15.622 --> 00:07:18.257
how it could contain actual information.

00:07:18.257 --> 00:07:19.964
And we go into much much more depth

00:07:19.964 --> 00:07:21.694
in two future videos.

00:07:21.694 --> 00:07:23.795
Now the sad part about this story is,

00:07:23.795 --> 00:07:27.255
Wilkins, Watson, and Crick went on to win

00:07:27.255 --> 00:07:30.634
a Nobel prize, Franklin unfortunately died

00:07:30.634 --> 00:07:32.793
very young and you're
not allowed to receive

00:07:32.793 --> 00:07:35.498
a Nobel prize if you've passed away.

00:07:35.498 --> 00:07:37.578
So she's very deserving of it.

00:07:37.578 --> 00:07:39.673
This work, which a lot of people consider

00:07:39.673 --> 00:07:41.461
to be one of the biggest discoveries

00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:44.932
in science, was based on what she did.

00:07:44.932 --> 00:07:47.591
Arguably, had Watson and Crick not had

00:07:47.591 --> 00:07:49.100
access to her work, they would not have

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.701
been able to figure it
out, and if she'd just

00:07:51.701 --> 00:07:52.757
stuck to what she was doing without

00:07:52.757 --> 00:07:54.116
other people having accessed her work,

00:07:54.116 --> 00:07:56.119
she might have been
able to get to that same

00:07:56.119 --> 00:07:58.011
conclusion, so she is
one of the people who,

00:07:58.011 --> 00:08:00.693
sometimes, the history
of science overlooks.

00:08:00.693 --> 00:08:02.992
But this isn't to not give credit to

00:08:02.992 --> 00:08:04.675
Watson and Crick either, there were still

00:08:04.675 --> 00:08:06.916
a lot of very powerful intuitive leaps

00:08:06.916 --> 00:08:09.192
that they had to make to come up with this

00:08:09.192 --> 00:08:11.850
double helix structure, this anti-parallel

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:13.000
double helix structure where they go

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.856
in opposite directions, but they bridge

00:08:15.856 --> 00:08:19.211
with these nitrogenous bases
pairing with each other.

00:08:19.211 --> 00:08:22.311
And this is a big, big, big, big deal.

00:08:22.311 --> 00:08:25.016
Throughout most of human history, we knew

00:08:25.016 --> 00:08:26.734
that traits were passed on but traits

00:08:26.734 --> 00:08:28.673
seemed like this magical mystical thing.

00:08:30.113 --> 00:08:31.902
"I know my laugh is like my dad's,

00:08:31.902 --> 00:08:35.640
"but how is that actually
encoded in my DNA?"

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.823
And now, we're able to see that a lot

00:08:37.823 --> 00:08:41.051
of what we consider
about ourselves to be us,

00:08:41.051 --> 00:08:43.407
is encoded in these molecules and encoded

00:08:43.407 --> 00:08:46.008
in these base pairs, so it's beautiful,

00:08:46.008 --> 00:08:49.387
it's incredible, it's
shedding light on one

00:08:49.387 --> 00:08:52.127
of the biggest mysteries
of what makes humans,

00:08:52.127 --> 00:08:55.151
actually all life, life.
