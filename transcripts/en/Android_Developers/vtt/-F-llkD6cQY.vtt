HOI LAM: Android Wear 2.0 is
the most significant update

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.400
to Android Wear since
its launch in 2014.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.020
I'm Hoi Lam, and
I'm here to take you

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.140
through three highlights
of Android Wear 2.0.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.800
First, Material Design has
arrived on Android Wear.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.980
The new Android Wear interface
uses a darker color palette,

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.270
which makes the watch blend in
more in social environments.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.350
It also helps save battery
by [INAUDIBLE] displays.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.390
We also suggest that
developer adopts

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.610
vertical layouts and
reserve horizontal

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.460
swipe for activity dismissal.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.130
In our research, this makes
the user interface easier

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.870
to understand.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.750
To help develop and implement
these new design patterns,

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.540
we have introduced new
user interface components,

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.730
such as the wearable
[? draw layout ?]

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.160
and wearable recycler view.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.470
Check out the Material
Design for Android Wear site

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.310
for more details.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.430
The second highlights
for Android Wear 2.0

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.530
is watch face complications.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.050
Before Android Wear
2.0, if a watch face

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.570
wanted to display
data from another app,

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.140
they need a one-to-one agreement
in both business and technical

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.460
terms.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.790
To alleviate this complexity
with Android Wear 2.0,

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.170
we have introduced
a complications API.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.880
Complications are a
traditional watchmaking term

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.450
for areas of the watch face
that displays information

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.550
other than the time, such as
the date or phases of the moon.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.130
We have extended this
concept to smartwatches,

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.960
so any app can publish data
for watch faces to consume.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.060
And watch faces can
display this data

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.810
in a style that fits into
their unique designs.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.360
For app developers,
this helps increase user

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.970
engagement and mindshare.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.950
For watch face makers, this
adds utility to the watch face.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.040
Users can now choose whichever
watch face they want,

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.070
as well as getting the
data that they need.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.840
Check out the Watch
Face and Complications

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.780
sections of the Developer
Documentation for more details.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.290
Last but not least,
standalone functionality--

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.990
previously, Android
Wear 1.0 apps

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.780
require a phone app to
communicate with the cloud.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.610
With Android Wear 2.0, wear
apps can access the internet

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.150
directly without the need for
a corresponding Android phone

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.010
app installed.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.220
This means the Android Wear
app can access the internet,

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.400
even if the user has an iPhone.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.380
To help with app
distribution, we

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.430
have also put the Google
Play Store on the watch.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.540
Users can now download apps
directly on their wrists.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.730
Apart from these three
areas of improvement--

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.870
Material Design, complications,
and standalone apps--

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.710
there are numerous
other enhancements

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.551
with Android Wear 2.0.

00:02:46.551 --> 00:02:48.050
Check out the Android
Wear Developer

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.930
site for more details.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:50.920
I'm Hoi Lam.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.570
Happy coding.

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:53.600
Thank you for watching.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.800
We have also got a series
on Android Wear performance.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.060
