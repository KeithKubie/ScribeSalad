00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
to phase it out because it's very hard
 

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.440 align:start position:0%

to be very very hard to phase out so
 

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:19.260 align:start position:0%

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:21.250 align:start position:0%

00:25:24.419 --> 00:25:24.429 align:start position:0%
altogether that's it I think that's
 

00:25:24.429 --> 00:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
altogether that's it I think that's
