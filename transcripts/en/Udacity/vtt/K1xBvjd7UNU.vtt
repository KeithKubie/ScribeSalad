00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.670
So now that we have the dream solution,
and

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.300
we all decide it's best,
we move to prototyping, right?

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.490
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.870
Prototyping is a wonderful
way to test your ideas.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.340
In fact, we want to make prototypes
that are real enough to feel, so

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.200
that we can test them with users,
and that's all that's required.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.650
Prototyping can take many forms.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.775
The simplest is to do a paper prototype
where you can quickly gather feedback.

00:00:26.775 --> 00:00:31.367
One level up from that is to work on
digital designs that are mid fidelity or

00:00:31.367 --> 00:00:32.417
high fidelity.

00:00:32.417 --> 00:00:36.532
The higher the fidelity the easier it is
to test and to get feedback from users

00:00:36.532 --> 00:00:40.533
because they're looking something
that's a little bit more polished.

00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:44.980
A next level of prototyping is
actually creating physical prototypes.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:50.424
When we work on something like Project
Glass at Google or Project Moon, it's

00:00:50.424 --> 00:00:56.221
not about software always, it's about
what does the physical device look like?

00:00:56.221 --> 00:01:00.866
So that's when it's useful
to have materials that

00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:05.196
help you create a quick
shape of a general idea.

00:01:05.196 --> 00:01:07.958
Other prioritizes we
have made include video.

00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:10.784
In fact, if you try to explain
the product to some one,

00:01:10.784 --> 00:01:13.002
creating a video is super, super useful.

00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:14.280
&gt;&gt; Yeah, Dropbox did that.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.905
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:01:14.905 --> 00:01:15.464
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:15.464 --> 00:01:18.636
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The little how to videos
that a lot of companies use to

00:01:18.636 --> 00:01:22.570
describe their services are really
useful in the design phase.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.530
If you make it straight on, even if
it's shot with a little mobile phone,

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.970
and the users are the friends
that you're working with.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.840
That can be sufficient to explain the
idea to a user, or to an investor, and

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.090
to test it.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.960
If you want the high quality prototype,
you need to spend longer developing it.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.400
&gt;&gt; So I can actually code it.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.040
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.140
I think coding a prototype is a great
idea, so some people are able

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.730
to really sprint, and within two days,
start to already call the prototype.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.000
And then you can have
an interactive demo.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.760
Or some people take maybe four or
five days,

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.480
depending on how complex
the solution is.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.990
So the duration of the prototyping

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.300
phase is usually what determines
the duration of the sprint.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.310
This is the key aspect in which
actually the work is getting made.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.350
If you're someone who loves to code,
who loves to design,

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.270
this is the phase that
you really get to shine.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.920
And if you're looking for a low
fidelity prototype, a short sprint,

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.320
a few hours might be sufficient.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.160
If you want something that's high
fidelity, or requires a demo or

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.280
a video, you're better advised to have
a whole week of the team's time so

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.760
you can make something beautiful.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.670
&gt;&gt; How do I know which to choose, if I
choose a high fidelity or low fidelity?

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:34.253
What is the best?

00:02:34.253 --> 00:02:38.741
&gt;&gt; Okay, so, if you're working on a new
product, it's probably best to shoot for

00:02:38.741 --> 00:02:39.804
medium fidelity.

00:02:39.804 --> 00:02:44.580
That means that you're not looking
at paper prototypes necessarily.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.350
You might have some early wire frames,

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.980
and that you're starting
to put some color on them.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.640
Or that you also use Keynote or
a quick prototyping tool that

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.270
your engineers know how to use in
order to bring some life to the ideas.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.410
We believe in teams choosing
their own prototyping tools.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.000
There's a lot that's
available on the market, and

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.090
the right ones are the ones
your team loves to use.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.114
If you're wondering where to start,
Sketch is a really great example.

00:03:12.114 --> 00:03:15.505
So is Adobe Suite, although it does
take a little bit of time to learn.

00:03:15.505 --> 00:03:16.537
And then Keynote and

00:03:16.537 --> 00:03:19.700
Google Sites are also really
useful in prototyping quickly.
