Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]. Boom. Good. Okay. We had some tough technical problem. Let's try it again. Okay. So anyway, brother, welcome. Thanks for coming here. Thanks. Thanks. So what we were saying before, we actually said this already, but let's say it again because the people didn't hear it. You were one of the pioneers of standup comedy in Brazil. Yeah, yeah. He was a, I started with like four or five guys. We started doing it like 16, 17 years ago and uh, nobody knew about standup. It was something that I found out when I came here to live and play basketball. I had a scholarship to play basketball and I watched Jim Gaffigan. Oh Wow. And Brian Regan. Ah, I know those guys. And I thought it was so weird because those guys were like, that's, I was questioning his, his, his, does he call his name? Brian Regan does. He is actually him because we used to have characters and impersonators, so we was kind of weird.

Speaker 1:          01:04          But at the same time, it was interesting because I'm not a guy who does characters and I do observations and I ride, I was a journalist, I'm a heavy degree in journalism. So he was interesting for me to see those guys doing comedy and I thought we could do the same in my country. It's so crazy that it took that long for it to get to Brazil. Yeah. You would think that because everything else, I mean, you guys have movies and you know, uh, I mean city of God, you have action movies, you have all these, you have so much that's so similar. The fact that standup comedy made it there is so unusual to see a, I took a long time a, it was, I don't know why, but the image off a comedian speaking like with a blazer or a suit or something was Jerry Seinfeld, very American.

Speaker 1:          01:45          You know, and those jokes, do they actually connect them much with us? Like, Oh, I have those buckets. And it was something that we have bigger problems than, oh, I just have a pocket. Or when am I gonna put my pan? I was like, he was, he was something that I could, we couldn't connect them much, but when we, when we saw there was a lot of people doing other stuff and there was like this huge role that we could actually explore that was when it become interesting for us. So comedy in Brazil, there would basically be like a, like say if I was a Brazilian community and I would come up with a fake name, if you will, and I would do a character, a wig, a wig. I'll wear a certain outfit, outfit like a very over the top screaming and uh, and that's teal still exists in Brazil.

Speaker 1:          02:32          This is like a popular part of the people stand up. I'm not saying that it's for everyone. Now I have my Netflix bash show. We B is becoming huge because, uh, we have some other options right now with the Internet. Everything changed. The game changed completely. So we have, uh, what is good has his own space right now. It's not only was the TV ones shoot to watch it. So the game changed a little for, for all of, so how did you start out? Did you start out by going to music clubs or, he was, I actually studying the a BDSM club sadomasochists clubs. I remember that there was like pictures Cox in the band and in like a giant as a huge vaginas and their habit, and we had that show any you was, it wasn't good, but it was an experience for all of us to go on stage and try to, to, to show them a, our opinions and our jokes and some irony and sarcasm and we wish, which was something that people wasn't watching, eh.

Speaker 1:          03:41          But then he becomes, he becomes something huge and we got chances to go to TV and everything else. But at first it was difficult because people could not understand is he a character? Is he playing a part? So that's why I had an ice tea. We'll have a lot of problems with the law because like I did a rape joke, which I'm not proud of. I'm saying it's not something like, oh, I'm so over the top, I love it in the line. And, but uh, he was like, does, does this guy wants people to be raped at what is, what is he thinking? What is, because with all those jokes was taken out of context and put it on newspapers kind of killed, uh, you kind of killed my desire to the comedy over that as well. Really? Yeah, it was, it was difficult man, because he was like journalists, journalists in the audience waiting for me to say some shit booed out of context.

Speaker 1:          04:36          And then the guy at like fucking like billions of clicks on their websites because of core joke. I did. Yeah. That's how we, the controversy was starting over that. And I don't know if it's the same thing here. So they knew that this was a new thing. They, and so they would come to see it. And then what were they criticizing it before this? He was, he was huge. Everybody loved today first. But when, when, when, when, when we started to have money and a TV shows and we kind of, uh, ran away out of the underground, I was doing shows at midnight, like packing at three, 300 CT at there, at midnight in Brazil. That was my thing. I underground in some fall in the middle of nowhere. But then people have this guy's talented. Let me give him a chance. So they put me on TV and out of nowhere I was on TV doing the same thing.

Speaker 1:          05:29          Wow. So the, the, the country was not that prepared for what I was doing at the time. What kind of laws do you have in Brazil in terms of like the language that you're allowed to use on television? Uh, you know, the, I'm not saying there's like a government censorship about what you can say, what you cannot say, but uh, sponsors and, and even TV stations and the media is very sensitive about everything because it's to a poor country. It's still a Brazil, still a third world country. So we are, we are like, we have a lot of people that don't understand the though, oh this is comedy. What, what's comedy? So it was my duty to explain a little bit why. Well we're stand up and kind of for open a road for all of us. That's how I felt. So you and you said three other new ways, like three or four guys.

Speaker 1:          06:23          So who are these other guys? They're still doing comedy in Brazil. Yeah. They still doing this to heal. What are their names? Uh, Marcello Mansfield than illusion. Chili or kind of feel you. There was a small group of guys that we started doing Brazilian Portuguese. It's such a beautiful language. I love it. I love it. It's like a song. It's like it's [inaudible] I'm doing Jujitsu for 23 years. So it's like, to me that sound is like, it's such a cool sound. What does, what does Brazilians say in, in Jersey says those that awards are something that they are still repeating that you know? Well, I mean, you know Paul Hall, Paul, which is com. Yeah. Is that fucker com which went to come. But sometimes we'll come ah, pull though. Sometimes you say it like damn, but it's come, it's called Com. But so that's funny. Cause like that's like the word Shit.

Speaker 1:          07:13          Like shit could be like, you could look at something, go chef medic. That's good input to this. Mad At. Okay. But shit can also be bad. Yeah. You know, like fuck too. Like fuck could be good or fuck could be bad. Like you could stub your tongue, go fuck. Or You could, you could see a girl with a beautiful body and go, fuck yeah. But Paul is the same thing. It's so crazy. But it's called boom. Got Big ba Ba. But anyway, you're getting a choke for her. Yeah, I got it. I got is the same. Exactly.
