00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:08.339
Disney films are known all over the world for their great animation captivating stories and lovable characters

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.819
It's too bad that behind all of that lies a sketchy production department

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.910
That's constantly being accused of ripping off other stories and all with good merit characters songs and whole plots

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.000
Nothing is safe when it comes to Disney stealing from the rest of Hollywood

Can you guess which movie is represented by these emojis? Stay tuned at the end of the video to find out. It's a surprise...

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.520
The Little Mermaid

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.749
Children of all ages loved traveling under the sea to watch the adventures of Ariel, a mermaid who seeks out more than her everyday life.

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:51.359
The film itself is known for great animation,

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:57.059
A wonderful story and a perfect villain in the form of Ursula on top of all that the film is packed with a lot of catchy

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.899
songs that help move the story along

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.400
Along with kiss the girl, and under the sea. One of the more popular songs the film soundtrack is part of your world

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.720
Wish I could be part of that world~

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.440
The song represents Ariel's desires to be a land dweller. If the song sounds familiar, then it's probably for a good reason. The lyrics,

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:23.220
message, and a flow in the song is directly ripped off from Little shop of horror's song entitled "Somewhere that's green"

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.240
Somewhere that's green~

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:35.460
In the 1986 musical the character of Audrey dreams of having a house with green grass a picket fence and traditional home features

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.739
Alan Menken wrote the music for both Little shop of horrors and The Little Mermaid in multiple interviews

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.360
he's admitted to basically stealing that song and

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:50.600
repurposing it for Ariel's key moment in the Disney animation. At least Ariel didn't have to go face to face with a human eating venus flytrap

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.050
Cars

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.669
Disney and Pixar's Cars could have been a huge miss or hit for the company.

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:08.008
Fortunately it was a hit that combined the clever design of cars with a down-to-Earth story about redemption,

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.789
family, and life in small towns. If the movie really meant something to you,

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.679
then you would probably love to watch Michael J Fox star in the 1991 comedy Doc Hollywood.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.080
Cars is essentially a beat by beat remake of that film.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.960
Let's break down the elements a little; in Doc Hollywood,

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:29.120
Michael J. Fox plays an overconfident doctor that eagerly travels cross country to reach travels cross country to reach his destination in California.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.440
During his trip, he accidentally crashes and destroys a fence. For his punishment

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.860
he must work in the town where he learns to love and connect with the residents there. In Cars

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.400
Lightning McQueen is an overconfident driver that eagerly travels cross-country to reach his destination in

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.120
California. During his trip he accidentally destroys a whole city street. For his punishment,

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.059
he must repair the road in the town where he learns to love and connect with the residents there. It's painfully obvious

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:59.040
how much Cars is exactly like the movie but Doc Hollywood never got any credit for the influence.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.400
Inside Out

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.640
Traveling inside the brain of a developing child is a great concept for a movie and

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:17.060
Disney executed it well with the creation of Inside Out. The film turns a complicated concept into something that children can easily understand and process.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.000
Not only is the story funny and entertaining,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.260
but it can be used by children to learn a little more about how their brains process various emotions and feelings. According to a

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.800
Psychologist named Denise Daniels she originally pitched the same idea to Disney as a full-length television pilot

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.610
entitled "The Moodsters." The characters in the series were named happiness, sadness, anger,

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:42.010
love, and fear. The only difference between the Moodsters and Inside Out is that disgust replaced love for the film

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.700
Daniels filed a lawsuit against Disney claiming that she gave them the idea

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.859
years before inside-out was developed. The Moodsters is now a full line of educational toys,

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.410
programs, and tools for educators and parents. The characters don't look exactly like the Disney counterparts,

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.529
but you can easily see enough similarities to have a potential case.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.480
The court case is still ongoing so there's no word on if Daniel claims are actually legit or not

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.730
Atlantis the Lost Empire

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.149
When disney decided to Produce Atlantis: the Lost Empire,

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:21.180
they ventured into a whole new territory that had not been explored in recent years. The animated action-adventure

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.320
featured a different style of animation,

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:29.949
removed the catchy songs featured in films like the Lion King and Aladdin, and was aimed at older children Rather than little youngsters. While the

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.959
film is not as acclaimed as other Disney classics,

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.239
it's not exactly the most original story, either.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.720
Shortly after the release of Atlantis in 2001, fans couldn't help but compare the character, story, and plot points to the

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.800
1990 Japanese anime known as Nadia: The Secret of Blue water

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:51.860
Just the character breakdown alone showcases all the things that Disney ripped off. This includes the nerdy main character, Milo, a

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.820
heroine who wears a mysterious crystal pendant, a

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.220
weapon loving ship doctor, and a gunnery sergeant that sports a crop top, haircut, and a mustache

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.720
Both films also take place around the same time,

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:09.540
features the same climactic moments with huge crystals, and focus on a power source that villains are trying to obtain for their own uses.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.330
There are way too many similar plot points for this to merely be a coincidence

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.280
It's clear that disney took a lot of the same elements from Nadia.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.060
The Lion King

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.000
In the jungle, the mighty jungle, the lion...

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:36.309
...steals ideas. Since the 1990s the Lion King has faced criticism about stealing ideas from a Japanese anime known as "Kimba the White Lion"

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.570
Sure, Kimba rhymes with Simba, but the copying goes way beyond that

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:47.679
The stories focus on family life. Each features a signature pride rock and voice actor Matthew Broderick even thought he was reading for the part

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:54.810
of Kimba and not Simba. Character comparisons have been made between Scar and Claw, the evil lions that both had issues with their eyes.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.020
Claw also has henchmen warriors of his own and to no one's surprise,

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.740
they're also hyenas. Other similar characters include a baboon that imparts advice and a bird that looked a lot like

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.000
Zazu. Disney spent years denying these connections,

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:13.200
but co-director Roger allers was actually living in Japan when the Kimba series was on the air.

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.350
The creators claimed that the film was based a little bit on Hamlet,

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:23.730
and there's definitely straight influenced designs and characters taken from Kimba with multiple sequels and television shows based off of the Lion King.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:29.180
Maybe one day Disney will acknowledge the story content. They use and create some type of crossover to make up for it.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.370
Aladdin

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.760
Aladdin was a huge part of the Disney renaissance that occurred in the late 80s and early 1990s

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.220
Released along with other films like the Little Mermaid,

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:49.580
Beauty and the Beast, and the Lion King, The movie was an instant classic with great voice casting, hit songs, and a fun "Rags to

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:54.060
Riches" story line. Unfortunately the story of Aladdin was not only based on classic fairy tales,

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:58.169
but it was stolen directly from an unreleased animated film known as "The Thief and the Cobbler."

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.940
The Thief and the Cobbler went through all kinds of production

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:06.840
problems. The animated project actually took more than 30 years to make, and the movie was never properly completed.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.869
Warner Brothers wanted to have the film release before Aladdin,

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.479
But that never happened and they decided to just drop the project

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:18.510
instead. After all of those years of animation a number of the animators and story designers ended up working on Aladdin and

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:25.649
clearly brought the same ideas. The Sultan is nearly identical in the film and Jafar and Genie are essentially both based on the characters of

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:28.049
Zigzag right down to the talking parrot on his shoulder.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:33.840
It's hard to ignore this influence, and if the film was released on time you have to wonder how different Aladdin would actually be.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:41.800
Up

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:46.500
Up is an ambitious story that could have easily been a failure for Pixar and Disney,

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:52.349
but ended up being a beloved tale about an old man living out the dreams that he and his wife once had. The film features

00:07:52.349 --> 00:07:57.509
many striking visuals including the house that is carried by thousands of balloons and floats away through the sky.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.989
Many people love to praise up for this completely original tale

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:03.899
But that may not be the case at all. In 2005,

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:09.539
multiple years before Up was released, there was a short French film released called "Above then Beyond"

00:08:09.639 --> 00:08:15.269
The story follows a widow whose old house is situated right in the middle of a large city area. Sound familiar?

00:08:15.699 --> 00:08:19.679
After the old woman receives an eviction notice she decides to craft a custom

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.199
hot air balloon that is powered by her own fireplace.

00:08:22.479 --> 00:08:26.939
The next day, her house has lifted off the plot she lives on and floats up into the sky.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:31.760
It's uncanny how similar these elements are and extremely obvious that Up drew inspiration

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:36.280
directly from them. The film never gives any story credit to short French animation.

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:40.300
It should have at least been included as some sort of bonus feature with the video release.

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:47.130
Pirates of the Caribbean

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:53.640
When watching the Pirates of the Caribbean films, it kind of feels like watching a live action video game. There are sword fights,

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:58.289
zombie pirates, constant action, and some crazy sets of the actors travel across.

00:08:58.329 --> 00:09:00.809
There's good reason for this. The first three movies in the franchise

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:09.180
heavily stole ideas from the video game franchise Monkey Island and it's canceled animated film. The similarities between the two are extremely hard to ignore.

00:09:09.399 --> 00:09:16.529
The undead pirate captain Barbossa is almost exactly like Lechuck, the main villain in the Monkey Island series. The character of Will Turner

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.490
shares a lot of the same character traits as the game's hero, Guy Brushed Threepwood.

00:09:20.589 --> 00:09:23.669
There are a lot of pirate movies, books, and content

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:27.149
but the connections between Monkey Island and Pirates of the Caribbean make sense.

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:34.620
Screenwriter Ted Elliott works on a draft of Monkey Island before the film was cancelled. He obviously took those ideas to Disney's pirate movie,

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:41.609
stealing them directly from the Lucasarts game series ideas for Monkey Island were spread through three different movies along with characters,

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:45.839
you can see matching sets, coffin-shaped boats, and crazy voodoo ladies.

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:50.480
Basically, the film should have been named Pirates of the Carribean Monkey Island.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.770
Dinosaur

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:58.770
For the release of Disney's dinosaur,

00:09:58.899 --> 00:10:06.449
animators ditched their traditional style to present something that was more realistic in nature and features real backgrounds that were mixed with digital effects. The

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:10.679
end result is a mixed bag with some strange animation and a far cry from animated dinosaurs

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.229
we've seen in the past. It still makes it really hard to deny

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:16.289
How much Disney's Dinosaur ripped off from "The Land Before Time."

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.310
And no.

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:22.140
We're not talking about the +12 sequels of the film that spawned. You just need to look back at the original

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.649
Land Before Time to see how much was copied. In both films,

00:10:25.649 --> 00:10:31.949
there's a catastrophic event that causes the dinosaurs to get separated from their families. The dinosaurs then must team up with a group of friends

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:35.369
to find a great valley where they can live peacefully for the rest of their days.

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:40.529
Both groups of friends also find themselves going up against a giant predator trying to make them its next meal.

00:10:40.839 --> 00:10:47.189
Despite the Modern technology, Disney's Dinosaur pales in comparison to the great animation and characters featured in the land before time.

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:51.280
You're better off watching the original instead of the Disney ripoff. Oh, you're melting

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:57.250
Frozen

00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:01.380
When Frozen was first released, fans loved the original take on a Disney princess

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:04.409
tale. The typical Disney prince turned out to be a villain, the true

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:06.310
love, the story involved the bond between

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:12.419
sisters and the songs created an instant hit among fans to help promote the film, the animators created a number of shorts featuring

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:16.109
supporting characters like Olaf and Sven. One of these shorts showcases

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:20.820
Olaf losing his carrot nose and a battle between him and Sven to see who can retrieve it first.

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:25.499
The silly plot and premise of this idea was taken directly from an animated short film entitled

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:32.640
"Snowman." In that film, the snowman goes up against a small rabbit that seeks out the carrot for his next meal. In both shorts all

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:38.969
of the characters end up on a frozen lake where the carrot slides across the ice. Each one also features a twist ending where the

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:45.869
antagonist ends up actually helping the snowman return the carrot back to their face. The short film didn't end up in the final Frozen movie,

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:51.990
but it is a bonus feature on many of the releases, and it's really clear how much they copied the other film.

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:52.570
Well, there you have it.

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:57.119
