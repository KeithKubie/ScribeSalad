00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.980
We might suppose that the best place to think
would be a large room with a big desk, plenty

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:11.730
of natural light and a window with a view
– perhaps onto water or a park. This is

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.859
the premise behind the layout of most offices.
The nearer one gets to the top, the closer

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:23.029
one’s work station will approximate to this
supposed ideal: in tribute to the quality

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:29.990
of thinking that, ideally, one would do there.
Bosses tend to have big desks and even larger

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.510
views. But these assumption are not – in
fact – really true to the way our minds

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.960
work. The
primary obstacle to good thinking is not a

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.710
cramped desk or an uninteresting horizon.
It is, first and foremost, anxiety. Often

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.050
the most profound thoughts we need to grapple
with have a potentially disturbing character.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.220
If we were to pinpoint them accurately and
get clear about their significance, there

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.350
could be a risk. We might discover that some
of our past, rather cherished, beliefs were

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.140
not as wise as we’d supposed; we might realise
we were previously deeply wrong about something;

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.210
we might have to make some significant and
tricky changes to our lives. As these potential

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.850
implications start to come vaguely into view,
our inner censor, motivated by a desire for

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:23.460
calm rather than growth, gets alarmed. A vigilant
part of the self gets agitated; it distracts

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.040
us, it makes us feel tired or gives us a strong
need to go online. Skilfully, it confuses

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.140
and muddles our train of thought. It blocks
the progress we were starting to make towards

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.310
ideas that – though important and interesting
– also presented marked threats to short-term

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.180
peace. It in this context that the shower
emerges as so helpful to the way our minds

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.200
work and earns the right to be honoured as
one of the best places on earth in which to

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.880
do any kind of serious reflection. Amidst
the crashing water and the steam and with

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.460
a few minutes of respite before the day starts,
the mind is no longer on guard. We’re not

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.729
supposed to be doing much inside our heads;
we’re mainly occupied with trying to soap

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.400
our backs and properly rinse our hair. The
ideas that have been half-forming at the back

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.560
of our minds, ideas about what the true purpose
of our lives might be and what we should do

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.620
next, keep up their steady inward pressure
– but now there is a lot less to stop them

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.090
reaching full consciousness. We’re not meant
to be thinking and so – at last – we can

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.849
think freely and courageously. .This quality
of sufficient – but not overwhelming – distraction

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:38.459
might equally well be present when we’re
driving down the highway or walking in a forest;

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.379
when there’s just enough for the managerial
timid side of the mind to be doing to keep

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:49.470
it from interfering with our authentic and
bolder inner machinations. Our world places

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.859
a very high premium on good ideas – but
spends very little serious effort in investigating

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:03.019
why we find it extraordinarily hard to hatch
them. Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote: ‘In

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:10.150
the minds of geniuses, we find our own neglected
thoughts.’ In other words, so-called geniuses

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.579
don’t have thoughts different from the ones
most of us have. They’re just a lot better

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:20.000
at not allowing their inhibitions and preconceptions
to get in the way of properly entertaining

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.329
them. In a utopian future, we would get a
lot more creative about what real thinking

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:30.559
is and where it happens. We’d learn that
the real enemy of good thinking isn’t a

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:36.669
small desk or a modest view: it is – almost
always – anxiety, for which there can be

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.080
few better cures than that library of our
deeper selves: the morning shower.
