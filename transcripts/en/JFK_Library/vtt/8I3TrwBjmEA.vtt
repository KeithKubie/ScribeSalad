00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.920
- There is a misconception,
I think, about global health.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.130
We think global health is about care

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.603
in just the poorest parts of the world.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.110
But the way I think about global health,

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.110
it's about the idea of making
care better everywhere.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.910
The idea that we are trying
to deploy the capabilities

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.200
that we have discovered
over the last century

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.663
town by town to every person alive.
