00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:07.213
- Hi I'm Sal Khan, founder
of the Khan Academy

00:00:07.213 --> 00:00:09.610
and I just wanted to let you
know how excited all of us are

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.978
for what we have in store
this coming back to school.

00:00:13.978 --> 00:00:16.590
First and foremost, this
is going to be a big effort

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.971
in terms of working with
teachers and classrooms.

00:00:20.971 --> 00:00:23.791
This coming back to school,
teachers are going to be able

00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:27.177
to better assign practice on Khan Academy

00:00:27.177 --> 00:00:30.676
and get reports on
where their students are

00:00:30.676 --> 00:00:33.753
to give optimal personalized practice.

00:00:33.753 --> 00:00:36.768
This practice is going to
be aligned with standards

00:00:36.768 --> 00:00:39.125
across subjects and grades.

00:00:39.125 --> 00:00:41.104
We're also adding a lot more content

00:00:41.104 --> 00:00:43.963
and to be clear, Khan Academy
is much much much more

00:00:43.963 --> 00:00:47.596
than just videos, we have
standards-aligned practice

00:00:47.596 --> 00:00:51.451
across subjects and grades,
keep a look out for well beyond

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:54.622
math, biology, chemistry,
physics, and especially

00:00:54.622 --> 00:00:57.144
this coming year, we're
adding a lot in history.

00:00:57.144 --> 00:00:59.643
We're creating many tools
for independent learners

00:00:59.643 --> 00:01:02.341
and folks who are trying
to prepare for college

00:01:02.341 --> 00:01:06.023
and important standardized
exams like the SAT.

00:01:06.023 --> 00:01:08.450
We're really trying to reach the world.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.265
Our mission is a free
world class education

00:01:10.265 --> 00:01:13.487
for anyone anywhere, so we're
going to continue our efforts

00:01:13.487 --> 00:01:16.665
in Spanish, in Portuguese, in Hindi,

00:01:16.665 --> 00:01:20.509
and launch in other
significant geographies.

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.672
So there's a lot of work ahead of us,

00:01:22.672 --> 00:01:25.942
but we're very very very
excited and I just wanna thank

00:01:25.942 --> 00:01:29.854
all of y'all for being part
of the Khan Academy community.

00:01:29.854 --> 00:01:33.197
And many of you have directly
supported these efforts

00:01:33.197 --> 00:01:36.307
and I hope you too feel
proud of all of the reach

00:01:36.307 --> 00:01:40.390
and impact that we are
able to collectively have.
