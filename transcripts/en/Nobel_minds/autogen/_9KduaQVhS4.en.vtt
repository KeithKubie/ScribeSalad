discoveries seeing things from a
 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.400
discoveries seeing things from a
different angle and yes I think it's

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410
different angle and yes I think it's
 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.920

can't commit myself now but after I got
 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.070
can't commit myself now but after I got
a prize I felt hmmm maybe at some point

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080
a prize I felt hmmm maybe at some point
 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.439

I have to think about something else

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449
I have to think about something else
 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.380
I have to think about something else
open textbooks again and check out what

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390
open textbooks again and check out what
 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.870
open textbooks again and check out what
what else is there that people believe

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880
what else is there that people believe
 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.119
what else is there that people believe
and has been repeated many times many

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129
and has been repeated many times many
 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.190
and has been repeated many times many
times many times and everyone believes

it and and maybe it's not the end of it

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340
it and and maybe it's not the end of it
 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.190
it and and maybe it's not the end of it
or maybe something important has been

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200
or maybe something important has been
 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.410

missed out I think it's very interesting

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420
missed out I think it's very interesting
 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.869
missed out I think it's very interesting
to see how science works this in

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879
to see how science works this in
 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.810
to see how science works this in
retrospect I didn't expect it honestly a

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820
retrospect I didn't expect it honestly a
 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.740
retrospect I didn't expect it honestly a
lot of it is perception I couldn't have

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750
lot of it is perception I couldn't have
 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.610
lot of it is perception I couldn't have
imagined that so sometimes people and

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620
imagined that so sometimes people and
 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.920
imagined that so sometimes people and
scientists perceive things in the wrong

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930
scientists perceive things in the wrong
 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.030
scientists perceive things in the wrong
way and just taking a different angle

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040
way and just taking a different angle
 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.179
way and just taking a different angle
and explaining things we're sorting out

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189
and explaining things we're sorting out
 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.390
and explaining things we're sorting out
things from a different angle all of a

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400
things from a different angle all of a
 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.520
things from a different angle all of a
sudden can open new aspects that that

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530
sudden can open new aspects that that
 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.140
sudden can open new aspects that that
you were totally unanticipated and this

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150
you were totally unanticipated and this
 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.910
you were totally unanticipated and this
is so important I think it's important

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920
is so important I think it's important
 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.160
is so important I think it's important
to to go back again say okay now we have

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170
to to go back again say okay now we have
 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.520
to to go back again say okay now we have
this phenomenon we have this thing but

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530
this phenomenon we have this thing but
 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.020
this phenomenon we have this thing but
we have to take a different angle C

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030
we have to take a different angle C
 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.789
we have to take a different angle C
maybe it's a different way of looking at

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799
maybe it's a different way of looking at
 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.069
maybe it's a different way of looking at
it still it has to be a valid one no

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079
it still it has to be a valid one no
 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.170
it still it has to be a valid one no
doubt but but taking a different angle

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180
doubt but but taking a different angle
 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.390
doubt but but taking a different angle
is so important i think the breaking of

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400
is so important i think the breaking of
 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.969
is so important i think the breaking of
the diffraction barrier is a fantastic

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979
the diffraction barrier is a fantastic
 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.429
the diffraction barrier is a fantastic
example because as i said the problem

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439
example because as i said the problem
 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.440
example because as i said the problem
was that people thought scientists

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450
was that people thought scientists
 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.170
was that people thought scientists
thought you have to distinguish features

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180
thought you have to distinguish features
 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.539
thought you have to distinguish features
so speak by the focusing of light the

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549
so speak by the focusing of light the
 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.910
so speak by the focusing of light the
phenomenon of focusing of light and

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920
phenomenon of focusing of light and
 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.830
phenomenon of focusing of light and
because it cannot focus light any better

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840
because it cannot focus light any better
 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.859
because it cannot focus light any better
than a certain diameter you cannot do it

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869
than a certain diameter you cannot do it
 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.800
than a certain diameter you cannot do it
but the breaking of the diffraction very

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810
but the breaking of the diffraction very
 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.039
but the breaking of the diffraction very
happened because i went back said oh but

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049
happened because i went back said oh but
 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.990
happened because i went back said oh but
do we have it do we have to separate by

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000
do we have it do we have to separate by
 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.029
do we have it do we have to separate by
the focusing of light or can we separate

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039
the focusing of light or can we separate
 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.279
the focusing of light or can we separate
by the molecular states and once we

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289
by the molecular states and once we
 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.900
by the molecular states and once we
separate the molecular states the

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910
separate the molecular states the
 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.870
separate the molecular states the
focusing of light

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880
focusing of light
 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.800
focusing of light
doesn't matter or hardly matters and

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810
doesn't matter or hardly matters and
 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.420
doesn't matter or hardly matters and
this is so important to understand so

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430
this is so important to understand so
 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.370
this is so important to understand so
just taking a different angle all of a

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380
just taking a different angle all of a
 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.380
just taking a different angle all of a
sudden makes things look totally

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390
sudden makes things look totally
 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.930
sudden makes things look totally
differently
