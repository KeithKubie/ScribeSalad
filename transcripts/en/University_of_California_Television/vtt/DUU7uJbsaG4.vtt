00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:03.980
- [Narrator] This
program is a presentation

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.193
of UCTV for educational and
non-commercial use only.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.770
(mellow electronic music)

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.940
- I'm William Lester,
professor of chemistry

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.350
and Chair of the Hitchcock
Professorship Committee.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.530
We're pleased, along with
the Graduate Council,

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.540
to present Professor Chikashi
Toyoshima, this year's speaker

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.063
in the Charles M. and Martha
Hitchcock Lecture Series.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.300
As a condition of this bequest,

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.460
we're obligated and happy to tell you how

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.500
the endowment came to UC Berkeley.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.200
It's a story that
exemplifies the many ways

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.150
this campus is linked to the history

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.093
of California and the Bay Area.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.400
Dr. Charles Hitchcock, a
physician for the Army,

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.050
came to San Francisco
during the Gold Rush,

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.840
where he opened a
thriving private practice.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.840
In 1885, Charles
established a professorship

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.470
here at Berkeley as an expression of

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.283
his long-held interest in education.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.960
His daughter, Lily Hitchcock Coit,

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.690
still treasured in San Francisco

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.920
for her colorful personality
as well as her generosity,

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.810
greatly expanded her
father's original gift

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.800
to establish a professorship
at UC Berkeley,

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.743
making it possible for us to
present a series of lectures.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.360
The Hitchcock fund has become
one of the most cherished

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.890
endowments of the
University of California,

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.430
recognizing the highest distinction

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.940
of scholarly thought and achievement.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.230
Thank you, Lily and
Charles, and now a few words

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.060
about Professor Chikashi Toyoshima.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.990
Chikashi Toyoshima is a
distinguished biophysicist,

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.100
and professor at the Institute
of Molecular and Cellular

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.110
Bio-sciences at the
University of Tokyo in Japan.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.780
He started his scientific career
as an electron microscopist

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.620
and worked on muscle
filaments and iron channels.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.680
Drawing on his expertise in the fields

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.500
of mathematics, physics, and biology,

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.260
Toyoshima has revealed
the atomic structures

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.823
of biological samples that
could never be studied before.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.520
Using x-ray crystallography,

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.590
he has determined the structure
of the calcium ATPase,

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.930
commonly referred to as the calcium pump,

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.453
and different phases of
the energy coupling cycle.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.170
Toyoshima's work on such
biological structures

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.290
has revolutionized how
researchers are able

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.663
to study the structure of proteins.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.050
Toyoshima is the author
of numerous articles

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.750
in scholarly journals.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.320
His research on the calcium
ATPase, which began in 1989,

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.390
produced the first images of an ion pump

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.850
at work in atomic detail, and explained

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.500
why the structure has to be so.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.380
These images graced the cover of Nature,

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.070
as well as served as an image

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.963
for the journal's annual calendar.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.290
Chikashi Toyoshima was
born in Akita, Japan,

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.280
where at a young age, his studies sparked

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.610
an interest in the sciences.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.640
He was accepted to the
University of Tokyo in 1973

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.080
in the physics department.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.640
And in 1978, chose to pursue biophysics,

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.640
receiving his Masters in 1980,
and his doctorate in 1983.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.940
After completing his degree,

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.908
Toyoshima served as a research associate

00:03:54.908 --> 00:03:59.870
at the University of
Tokyo from 1984 to 1986,

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.800
as a postdoctoral Fellow
at Stanford University

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.890
from 1986 to 1988.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.670
On a scientific staff the
Medical Research Counsel

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.330
Laboratory of Molecular Biology

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.460
at Cambridge from 1988 to 1989,

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.310
and as a research scientist

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.310
at the Frontier Research
Project RIKEN in 1989.

00:04:22.411 --> 00:04:24.470
In 1994, he accepted a professorship

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.140
at the University of Tokyo.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.300
In 2005, Toyoshima was
elected as a foreign associate

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.500
to the National Academy of Sciences.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.160
And in 2006, he was
named a national lecturer

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.810
at the Biophysical Society's
51st Annual Meeting,

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.450
the Society's highest honor.

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.369
Please join me in welcoming
Professor Chikashi Toyoshima.

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:48.619
(applause)

00:04:52.161 --> 00:04:56.570
- Well, first of all, I'd like
to thank Hitchcock Committee

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.540
and particularly Professor Esther

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.093
for a very kind introduction.

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.710
But I'd like to tell you
about just one protein.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.050
And this one you are looking here.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.460
And I'd like to tell you how this protein

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.150
called calcium pump really works,

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.203
and why structure has to be so.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.070
But before going into details,

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:27.070
perhaps I have to introduce
for many nonspecialist

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.770
why this protein is important,

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.390
and why the calcium is important.

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.173
Perhaps many of you here knows that a cell

00:05:37.173 --> 00:05:39.920
is full of membrane compartments.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.750
And this is just a cartoon,
but you see in the microcurve

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.393
and it's really full of
membrane compartments.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.650
Such biological membrane
consist of lipid bilayers.

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.569
And lipid bilayer, it's of
course consist of phospholipids,

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:02.260
and phospholipids has a polar head group

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.550
and hydrophobic tails called acid chains.

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:10.550
And they form this kind of membrane sheet.

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:15.340
And so the driving force
is hydrophobic interaction.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:20.340
And what is good about this
is it self-assembles in water.

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.820
And quite extensive one it can make.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.770
And also, it dislike the hole is made,

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.000
so it's self-sealing as well.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.750
So it's kind of a super glue in a way.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.630
And it turns out to be
just really the super glue,

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:42.630
and perhaps I'll show you
in the later of my talk.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.550
And the property of this one

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.850
is that it is very impermeant to ions,

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:53.130
for example, sodium,
potassium, chloride is here.

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:56.370
It's much more impermeant compared to

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.313
water itself, pure water.

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:04.890
And the result is you can
make a concentration gradient

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:10.430
for many ions important
for biological systems.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.640
And the common one is
sodium, for example, sodium.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.930
This is a case of muscle cells,

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.470
and I show you how the
muscle cell means that.

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:24.670
But here, the sodium
concentration outside of the cell

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:27.800
is 110 millimolar, and the sodium inside

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.370
of the cell is 10 millimolar.

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:31.480
The potassium is opposite.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:36.480
So you see the tenfold or so
differences in concentration.

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.800
But actually, the largest
concentration gradient

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.210
you see here is for calcium.

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:47.210
It has more than 10,000
fold gradient here.

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:57.410
And it's not actually rated,
this is divalent cations.

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.520
You see the magnesium here.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:04.030
And magnesium is just same,
inside and outside of the cell.

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:08.570
And what is important is this
ion concentration gradients

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:12.833
are used for many purposes
in biological processes.

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:18.300
They are certainly not in equilibrium.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:22.820
And equilibrium means
it's, you are dead, right?

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:27.820
Why the calcium is so
important, explained here.

00:08:31.532 --> 00:08:35.410
Calcium is actually the
ion that's most widely used

00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:37.950
in regulation of cellular processes.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:40.530
And if you hear the word calcium,

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:44.460
perhaps you think of your bones or teeth.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:48.420
And it's certainly true
because most of the calcium

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:53.420
in your body is in your
(clears throat) bone and teeth.

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:59.193
One human body contains
about 1400 grams of calcium.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:04.677
But only 10 grams or
less, so it's less than 1%

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:08.860
is used for regulation
of cellular processes.

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:12.820
So, it looks like very small amount,

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:16.230
but it has very important functions.

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:21.230
And the human body has so
many calcium-binding proteins.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:24.873
It's a good thing,

00:09:24.873 --> 00:09:29.480
I don't want to sort of
tell you about the diversity

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:33.970
of calcium seeing as there are
many excellent reviews here.

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:36.590
So I just want to show
you just one example.

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:38.213
It's a muscle contraction.

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:45.150
You see here your arm muscle, it is,

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:48.220
Muscle is a hierarchical structure.

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:51.400
So, it's actually a
bundle of muscle fibers.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.440
It's called muscle cells.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.037
And muscle fiber itself is consist of

00:09:56.037 --> 00:09:58.623
mainly the bundle muscles.

00:09:58.623 --> 00:10:03.150
Thick and thin filaments
assembly called myofibril

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.529
surrounded by a secure system called

00:10:05.529 --> 00:10:09.143
sarcoplasmic reticulum
here, so you see here,

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:13.870
this bundle is called myofibril

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:18.360
it's actually consists of
thick and thin filaments

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.059
and it is surrounded by vesicular system,

00:10:21.059 --> 00:10:24.280
sarcoplasmic reticulum
and sarcoplasmic reticulum

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.263
is a store of the calcium.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:31.470
And we also see, so
this is a cross-section

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:35.970
of this one, so the sarcoplasmic
reticulum is this things,

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:38.900
and you see this is
actually a vesicular system,

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:43.170
and also the muscle system has the tubal,

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:47.230
called transversal tube,
T-tubule here, right.

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:51.020
And when your brain sort of make order

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:54.360
with muscle to contract, then your muscle

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:58.288
then your motor neuron excites.

00:10:58.288 --> 00:11:00.260
The neuron excites, then

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.320
the action potential
is emitted and created

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:08.320
and goes down to the muscle
fiber along this nerve fiber.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:17.663
But what happens here is like this.

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:24.540
Your neuron excites first
at the sodium channel.

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:28.310
The channel for the
sodium ions sort of opens

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:30.673
and then the carbon potassium ions,

00:11:32.504 --> 00:11:35.700
potassium channels open
and turns out to make

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.520
this kind of action potential.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:42.360
So the initial stage is electrical signal

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.050
So the electrical signals come down

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:46.680
to this synapse and synaptic end

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:50.190
then here voltage dependent,

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:53.640
so-called voltage dependent
calcium channels exist

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.150
and make a fusion of this
kind of vesicle also.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:02.410
This vesicles contain
the chemical substance

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:04.470
so-called acetylcholine.

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:09.037
And acetylcholine is
emitted here like this,

00:12:09.037 --> 00:12:11.580
and so this is a chemical signal here.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:15.103
And chemical signal, so
the acetylcholine binds to

00:12:15.103 --> 00:12:20.103
its receptor on the other side
of these synaptic junctions.

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:26.010
And again, it's so that
acetylcholine receptor

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:30.580
is an ion channel, so
it's pass through the ions

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:34.520
sodium ions now can enter this area

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:37.450
and forms the action potential again.

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:40.660
So the electric signal comes here,

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:45.520
then the channel opens, and
the receptor ion channel opens

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:49.520
and again it makes electrical signal.

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:53.946
So it's down to this part,
so it's called T-tubule,

00:12:53.946 --> 00:12:57.630
and there is a voltage-dependent
calcium channel,

00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:59.310
different one here.

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:03.180
And it excites and it's opened

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:06.620
the so-called calcium release
channel on the t-tubule.

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:10.710
So the T-tubule is connected
to sarcoplasmic reticulum

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:17.280
and so the calcium stored
in the sarco reticulum

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.650
released into muscle cells.

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:24.170
If the calcium is released it binds to

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:30.280
Troponin C and Troponin C's
a calcium binding protein

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:35.280
and it moves along filaments
protein called tropomyosin.

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:39.000
And tropomyosin sort of prohibits

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.850
the binding of myosin heads

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:45.300
and when the calcium are
absent, but when its calcium

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:48.310
come to combine to this protein,

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:51.460
then this Tropomyosin moves and allows

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:55.498
this myosin head to move
productive interactions.

00:13:55.498 --> 00:14:00.498
Then the force is made, and
happens this kind of movement.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.203
So the key here is the calcium.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:09.713
As I told you that here
is the calcium channel,

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:15.820
the sodium ion channels, and
the calcium channel again,

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:18.210
and the other calcium channel.

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:19.500
So there are many kind of

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:24.443
different kind of ions
actually used for excitation.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:32.220
One thing I try to stress here is

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:35.680
the channel follows
concentration gradient.

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.820
So it's a diffusion process.

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:43.820
And no energy is actually
required so it's very efficient.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:48.190
More than 10 million ions per second

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:50.700
can go through a second.

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:53.013
It's a very efficient system.

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:59.080
We learned that calcium
is a very important ion,

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:03.993
but why is the calcium so useful?

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:07.703
Say why not magnesium?

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:14.360
And the answer is that
actually our systems

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:18.940
our living system,
because has lots of water

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:23.940
and water a really unusual substance

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:27.340
and so let's think about
what kind of properties

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:30.250
are required for a good
ion for degradation.

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:35.250
So the good ion here means
that a good ions easily

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:40.619
pass through and can invigorate
the biological processes.

00:15:40.619 --> 00:15:43.740
So, speed is certainly important,

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:48.740
if you want to make the
processing and the degradation

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:53.170
fast enough, of course the
ions have to pass through

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:55.830
the ion channels quite quickly.

00:15:55.830 --> 00:16:00.830
And if the ions bind to many proteins,

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.460
it does not help for degradation,

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:07.530
so it has to have a very
good specificity, right.

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:12.137
But also, if you don't need many ions,

00:16:12.137 --> 00:16:14.420
that will of course help.

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:17.410
Because just a small amount
of change is good enough

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:21.530
for degrading your biological processes.

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:24.880
Then, the next question, so
I can sort of think of these

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:28.794
three parameters, then
the next question asks

00:16:28.794 --> 00:16:33.690
in which physical property does
determine these parameters?

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.270
Size of the ion, or the charges of ions?

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:40.323
Or something more exotic?

00:16:41.857 --> 00:16:46.857
Well the answer is both charges and size.

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:53.905
So the size of cells,
of course we have a lot,

00:16:53.905 --> 00:16:58.905
all the substances immersed in water.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
And water is, I mentioned
that is an unusual substance.

00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:08.724
Because it has a strong polarizability.

00:17:08.724 --> 00:17:13.620
Polarizability means as a whole,
this is a neutral molecule,

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:17.410
it has a charge, it's a
partial charge on oxygen,

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:22.410
tends to be negative and hydrogen
tend to be a bit positive.

00:17:27.622 --> 00:17:31.733
When you look at the sodium
chloride, that's the salt,

00:17:31.733 --> 00:17:35.370
when you dissolve it in the water,

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:40.370
it's not just separated
like independent ions,

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:43.680
it's actually surrounded
by water molecules,

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:47.360
and sodium ion has a positive charge so

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:52.360
the negative charge of
oxygen sort of attracted to,

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:58.523
attracted and aligned water
molecules to like this way.

00:17:58.523 --> 00:18:02.187
And for the negative ions,
charges chloride ions,

00:18:02.187 --> 00:18:04.453
the water surrounds like this.

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:11.980
We are living in 300k
or something like that,

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:16.980
so there are lots of thermal
movement or thermal agitations.

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:22.810
So this so-called hydration sphere,

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:25.573
or hydration shell, is
a great dynamic one.

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:31.600
Compare the size of the ions
to water molecules here.

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:35.640
Lithium is just a .6 or so on the nucleus,

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:39.837
and the biggest one I show here
is Titanium at 1.4 hydration

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:46.430
and in the water environment
it's surrounded like this.

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:50.233
I just show you one
sort of hydration shell,

00:18:50.233 --> 00:18:52.700
it's called primary hydration shell.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.910
But it's actually surrounded
by second hydration shell,

00:18:55.910 --> 00:19:00.760
and even more sort of water molecules.

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:04.840
So that means that the ions are completely

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:08.110
wrapped around by water molecules, right.

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:11.690
So, for the proteins to
be able to distinguish

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:16.238
which one, which ion, the
protein actually needs,

00:19:16.238 --> 00:19:21.238
it has to sort of remove the water atoms,

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:25.700
water molecules from ions,

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:29.723
so it has to be partially
removed, partially dehydrated,

00:19:30.858 --> 00:19:33.163
for the protein to be able to reorganize.

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:37.733
So then the exchange actual
process is sort of like this.

00:19:39.964 --> 00:19:43.860
In the water, there was this
sodium ion surrounded by

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:48.073
many water molecules, but
it's a dynamic of things,

00:19:49.141 --> 00:19:53.160
there's a chance for this sodium
ion to lose water molecule,

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:57.600
and then the protein, our oxygen atoms,

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.550
so the substitute, this water oxygen atom,

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:02.830
to make this kind of interactions,

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:07.763
and so then protein
actually touches this ion.

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:15.240
Then if the ions, if pass
through this very narrow part

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:17.823
then it will rehydrate again.

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:20.853
That means the water binds again.

00:20:24.011 --> 00:20:27.470
So for the efficient transfer,

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:32.470
these sodium ions should
not notice whether this ion

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:37.490
is in the water molecule,
in the water environment

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:40.053
or it's touching the proteins.

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:46.020
So for what that means is like this.

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:51.420
So this is an actual structure
of a potassium channel.

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:57.040
Solved by MacKinnon almost
nearly 10 years ago or so,

00:20:57.615 --> 00:21:02.030
and this is a view along
the membrane plane.

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:06.410
So this just a lateral
view of the membrane.

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:11.008
This is called helices,
and the narrow body's here.

00:21:11.008 --> 00:21:14.830
This shows the two potassium ions.

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:17.330
So the potassium ions come from this way

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:19.210
and get out like that.

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:21.520
And if you look in more detail,

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.630
the potassium ions in this narrow area,

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:27.750
have an oxygen atom
coordinating like this,

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:31.140
so the protein atoms make coordination.

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:36.140
Very much the same as the
potassium ions in water.

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:39.798
So the potassium ion do not know whether

00:21:39.798 --> 00:21:44.798
it's in the water or in the
another part of proteins.

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:49.847
So the key thing is that...

00:21:50.815 --> 00:21:55.773
protein oxygen atom can
substitute the water molecule.

00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:59.337
For to discriminate sodium, sorry,

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:02.800
the potassium from sodium,

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.800
it uses the difference
in hydration energies,

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:10.260
so that means that a chance for

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:13.200
this ion to lose water molecules.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:18.200
Also if you put sodium
ion in this channel,

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:21.100
it looks like this, so this
is a view from the top.

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:23.220
Because this has four subunits,

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:25.258
this another part can actually

00:22:25.258 --> 00:22:28.770
has actually four oxygen
atoms, this shows just, yeah.

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:30.373
So these four atoms.

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:35.700
So in this potassium channel,

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:38.510
it has a perfect golden ration geometry.

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:43.090
Just as in the potassium ion is in water,

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:46.050
and the sodium ion cannot fit so well,

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:48.363
and because it is smaller.

00:22:49.943 --> 00:22:54.360
The sodium ion is much
smaller than potassium ions.

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.510
The sodium ion cannot go through

00:22:58.412 --> 00:23:00.290
because of difference in hydration energy

00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:05.290
and difference in the
coordination geometry

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:10.113
and I used the words
hydration energy here,

00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:13.260
but I did not explain well.

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:17.306
So this is sort of the
definition of hydration energy.

00:23:17.306 --> 00:23:22.306
So the hydration energies
change when one mole of molecule

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:26.250
is transferred from gas
phase to aqueous phase.

00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:28.400
Here is that sort of numbers.

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.860
And so then I compare the lithium,

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:35.100
sodium and potassium and also
magnesium and calcium here.

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:37.463
So there are clear differences.

00:23:38.558 --> 00:23:41.303
Although the sodium is....

00:23:43.878 --> 00:23:48.878
30% or so smaller, the hydration energy

00:23:49.082 --> 00:23:54.082
is also 15 kilocalories or so different.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:58.667
And this number is
actually very large number.

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:02.420
I will explain it later in my talk.

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:07.420
And if you compare this
number to a divalent cations,

00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:10.163
the difference is so large, right.

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:16.420
So this energy means that
if this number is larger,

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:20.870
the chances for water molecule

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:24.740
to detach from this ions becomes smaller.

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:29.740
So this is so-called
water substitution rate.

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:35.000
So this one, this is
methane ion to look at here.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.263
And so the substitution
rate means water molecule

00:24:38.263 --> 00:24:41.300
in the back has already made the exchange

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:43.770
of this unbound water molecules.

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:48.223
So you see the sodium,
potassium, lithium here, right.

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:54.770
Following the numbers given
in the previous table,

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:59.770
the potassium has the highest
substitution number, rate.

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.710
And sodium's slower, smaller and slower,

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:05.073
and the lithium is more slower.

00:25:06.317 --> 00:25:09.780
What is interesting is
calcium and magnesium.

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:12.197
Calcium is similar to sodium.

00:25:13.665 --> 00:25:16.807
So, it has a 10 to the 8th rate constant.

00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:24.860
But magnesium has a much
slower rate constant.

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:27.220
It has a 10 to the 5th or so.

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:30.380
So it's clear that it cannot be used

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:34.090
for microsecond degradations.

00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:39.090
So it has much longer time for
getting through the channel.

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:45.560
But calcium is quite
similar to monovalent ions.

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:47.090
It's very fast.

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:50.870
So the calcium can be
used for transmitting

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:54.303
single ion by using channels.

00:25:55.610 --> 00:26:00.200
And the magnesium is
much slower, so it needs,

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:05.200
perhaps needs special
system, not simple channel

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:09.220
is not good enough for magnesium transfer.

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:11.140
And certainly there are several

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:13.560
magnesium transporters I know of,

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:17.213
and they are transporters
and they use same energies

00:26:17.213 --> 00:26:22.213
and not merely a simple channel
using the thermal energies.

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:27.233
Let's think about this
specificities, here.

00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:31.100
I compare the magnesium, calcium,

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:35.250
and the coordination by oxygen atoms.

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:40.250
So this picture is written in scale.

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:43.570
So this is actual, you can
consider this as actual size

00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:47.510
of the magnesium and oxygen,
the size of the oxygen.

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:51.250
So around magnesium you can certainly,

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:55.790
there's four oxygen
atoms and two on behind

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:57.950
and on top of this magnesium.

00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:01.350
So the six coordination is quite possible,

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:03.583
and has a very nice geometry.

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:08.970
For the calcium, it's not impossible,

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:13.557
but some distance is still,

00:27:13.557 --> 00:27:17.960
some spaces are available and
you can actually make seven.

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:22.340
Just five oxygen atoms...

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:27.340
completely fill the space
surrounding this calcium ion.

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:32.560
So this, if you can put
one oxygen atom behind

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:35.110
and on top this calcium, so the seven

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:38.720
coordination is quite possible.

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:43.070
And perhaps looks, perhaps
makes a very nice coordination,

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:46.490
will give a high affinity to our system.

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:50.990
But if you look at the
same configuration to,

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:55.990
of magnesium, it's impossible
already because magnesium

00:27:56.260 --> 00:28:01.260
is smaller ions, so if we put
five oxygen atoms like this,

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:07.840
it's contact too much,
too hard really, too hard.

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:15.880
It cannot accommodate
this kind of geometry.

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:19.430
And also there must be
a strong attraction,

00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:25.533
electrostatic interaction
between oxygen atoms,

00:28:25.533 --> 00:28:28.903
because it becomes too close.

00:28:30.652 --> 00:28:32.302
We know, how do you know it is...

00:28:34.599 --> 00:28:38.064
If the atom is small,
if the ion is smaller,

00:28:38.064 --> 00:28:41.727
then the distance between this middle ion

00:28:41.727 --> 00:28:44.630
and the coordinating
oxygen atom is shorter.

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:48.093
That means that the electrostatic
force will be stronger.

00:28:50.051 --> 00:28:53.890
That also means that
this binding is tighter.

00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:57.840
But because of the smallness of this ion,

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:02.830
it requires a quite regular geometry

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:05.620
of coordinating oxygen atoms.

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:08.800
And here, if it becomes bigger than

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.800
the seven coordination possible,

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:15.800
so if the protein has several
oxygen atoms like this,

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:22.040
it only selects the calcium,
and magnesium cannot bind.

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:27.040
So it converts the protein specificities.

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:30.773
So the big ion like calcium
is just really, pretty good.

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:39.290
In reality, this is an atomic model of a

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:42.150
one calcium binding
protein called subtilisin,

00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:45.280
it has seven coordination
and this is the most

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:48.870
common calcium binding motif, actually.

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:53.083
And it always has seven
coordinating oxygen atoms.

00:29:54.284 --> 00:29:58.247
This can exclude magnesium
binding very well.

00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:04.720
So I can sort of list four
reasons that make calcium ideal

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.990
for regulation of cellular processes.

00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:10.230
It's a divalent cations,
it's free to monovalent

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:13.206
the affinity could be
too low and you may need

00:30:13.206 --> 00:30:16.360
a big number of ions have to be

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:19.610
transferred to regulate the processes.

00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:22.144
And it's large enough.

00:30:22.144 --> 00:30:25.010
Because it's large enough, it has,

00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:28.950
it can give the protein specificity

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:33.610
to exclude sodium ions,
sorry the magnesium.

00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:37.753
And it is a so-called hard ion.

00:30:37.753 --> 00:30:41.750
Hard metal ion, so it likes
oxygen for coordinations.

00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:44.860
On some ions...

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:50.890
like gold, likes sulfur atoms,

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:54.304
and the protein is mostly consists

00:30:54.304 --> 00:30:58.560
of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen,

00:30:58.560 --> 00:30:59.820
and the content of the sodium,

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:02.620
the sulfur atom is much smaller.

00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:06.630
So it makes sense to use abundant

00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:09.443
oxygen atoms for coordinations.

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:15.033
All these properties are
apply to say strontium,

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:20.510
it is even bigger and has divalent ions.

00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:22.120
And like oxygen for coordination.

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:25.990
But you cannot find much, large amounts

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:28.430
of strontium in the nature.

00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:32.140
So you can't really rely on it.

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:37.140
So these four reasons make calcium so good

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:40.253
for the regulation of processes.

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:46.220
Instead, magnesium has
a, it requires very...

00:31:48.527 --> 00:31:51.010
regular geometry for binding.

00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:56.010
And has a stronger power
for fixing the oxygen atoms.

00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:00.420
So that means magnesium can be used

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:02.123
for fixing protein structure.

00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:08.940
Even for catalyzing reaction
by pulling electrons

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:12.200
towards magnesium, because
it has a much stronger power

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:13.423
compared to calcium.

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:17.020
One more thing I have to try to mention,

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:21.146
a very low concentration
of calcium inside the cell.

00:32:21.146 --> 00:32:25.070
This perhaps in evolution,
this was necessary,

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:28.430
because otherwise calcium, if
it's higher and the calcium

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:31.680
precipitated phosphorate,
massive amounts abundant

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:33.920
in interior of the cells.

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:38.550
But what is good about this
is because it's so low,

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:43.550
only a very small number
transfer from outside to inside.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.693
Then, it's a big change.

00:32:48.592 --> 00:32:52.380
That's also pretty good for
the sensitivity of the system.

00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:55.270
It's very efficient because it doesn't

00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:57.410
have to transfer so many ions.

00:32:57.410 --> 00:33:00.623
So many sort of good things about calcium.

00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:06.280
And this (clears throat) difference is in

00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:12.690
ion concentration used for signaling,

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:16.540
as I mentioned, as I explained
using muscle systems,

00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:20.050
and that purpose is the channels I used,

00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:23.820
plus very efficient system,
10 million ions per second.

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:28.820
But, if the system has to go
back to the original position

00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:33.082
otherwise you can make
just one contraction,

00:33:33.082 --> 00:33:35.420
it makes no sense.

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:40.170
So what is very important is
to make these sort of stable

00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:44.720
conditions shown in the
slide and that is maintained

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:49.720
by so-called ion pumps
and so the ion pumps

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:53.820
works against concentration gradient

00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:58.360
because after the excitation,
the calcium sort of released

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:03.250
from the sarcoplasmic
reticulum to muscle cells.

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:05.410
But it has to be pumped back

00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:08.603
into the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:14.950
So this process occurs against
concentration gradient,

00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:17.390
so it requires energy.

00:34:17.390 --> 00:34:22.390
And the, as I mentioned, as I
explained using this shortly,

00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:29.200
it requires the ATP and so it's,

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:34.316
it uses the energy of ATP,
it goes through cycles.

00:34:34.316 --> 00:34:39.316
The cycle is only 30 cycles
possible at normal temp,

00:34:39.753 --> 00:34:43.830
for your body temperatures
and one cycle can

00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:46.300
transfer only two calcium ions.

00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:50.510
So altogether, only 60 calcium ions

00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:53.290
per second actually transferred.

00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:56.883
So if you compare these two
numbers, it's a huge difference.

00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:02.840
So if these, the nature
wants to make the contraction

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:06.790
and the relaxation in
a similar time scale,

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:09.110
you need a very small number of ions,

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:13.373
but you need huge number of pumps, right.

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:17.410
If I were to explain this to you.

00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:21.130
So if the ion pumps concentration
gradient are maintained

00:35:21.130 --> 00:35:24.520
by ion pump, it's a real name,

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:28.723
it's more sort of a rigorous
name is a P-type ATP,

00:35:28.723 --> 00:35:31.200
it's the energy comes from this reactions.

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:34.120
So the, adenosine triphosphate

00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:36.990
so the arm of a beta gamma phosphate,

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:38.340
the adenosine model is here

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:45.420
is hydrolyzed so this beta gamma
phosphate born is cut here,

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:47.609
and makes a phosphate.

00:35:47.609 --> 00:35:51.400
But in the real system is actually this

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:56.370
gamma phosphate is transferred
to the protein first.

00:35:56.370 --> 00:36:00.322
This process is called phosphorylation.

00:36:00.322 --> 00:36:03.160
What else I should mention is that

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:09.150
about 25% of ATP is consumed
is used for ion pumping.

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:13.780
So maintaining the ion
concentration gradient.

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:18.280
And the number of ATP,
amount of ATP consumed

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:21.000
is nearly your body weight.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.690
And it's a very large number.

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:26.882
But so, perhaps you have
heard that the life's energy

00:36:26.882 --> 00:36:29.557
currency, the ATP, and all living things

00:36:29.557 --> 00:36:33.820
having to use the ATP
for energy conversion.

00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:37.420
And actually the Nobel
Prize in chemistry 1997...

00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:45.350
have been given to people
who studied the ATPase

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:46.673
and the ATP synthesis.

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:52.540
But the energy liberated by
ATP hydrolysis is rather small.

00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:56.490
And under normal certain
conditions it's about

00:36:56.490 --> 00:36:59.938
12 kilocalories per mole, if
you remember the hydration

00:36:59.938 --> 00:37:04.040
energy of calcium, it's
360 kilocalorie per mole.

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:07.630
If you compare it is 30 times hire, right.

00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:12.630
So it seems that, it looks
like very small number.

00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:16.090
And if you, and we know that

00:37:17.289 --> 00:37:21.180
this number corresponds
to approximately 20 times

00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:22.910
higher than the thermal energy.

00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:27.400
So all the system is sort
of shaking by thermal energy

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:31.500
and that thermal energy is
about 6 kilocalorie per mole.

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:35.241
But if you compare this
number with only 20 times,

00:37:35.241 --> 00:37:40.241
so the amount of energy...

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:46.000
hydrogen diversify ATP hydrolysis
looks kinda small and so,

00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:50.679
what we could do (clears throat)

00:37:50.679 --> 00:37:52.763
what the ATP does is seems can,

00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:59.630
not much, but is actually,

00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:02.890
the efficiency is so high
I will show you later.

00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:07.890
Yeah, so this is a point I
want to make a few minutes ago.

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:13.983
So you can actually count
calcium channels here.

00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:16.879
I mentioned that the number of channels

00:38:16.879 --> 00:38:19.240
required is very small.

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:23.493
And actually, you can
count in the micrograph.

00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:28.380
But you need huge number
of pump molecules.

00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:31.807
And this is a scallop muscle,

00:38:31.807 --> 00:38:36.520
so a scallop has a very
good, thick muscle fiber.

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:41.310
And in the Scallop muscle,
this micrograph shows that

00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:45.220
array of pump molecules.

00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:48.963
Pump protein, so this eye
shows you just one unit here.

00:38:49.971 --> 00:38:54.971
All of these are pump proteins.

00:38:55.193 --> 00:39:00.193
There are so many, and
actually more than 60%

00:39:00.295 --> 00:39:05.295
or 70% of all the membrane
from the proteins residing

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:08.820
in the membrane actually occupied

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:12.550
by this calcium pump proteins.

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:15.383
So it's quite good for structural studies.

00:39:18.866 --> 00:39:22.937
And in structure study,
we have to make crystals

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:30.023
so this is a kind of
very short explanation.

00:39:31.153 --> 00:39:35.864
We have a kind of this vesicle system

00:39:35.864 --> 00:39:40.630
grown from an actual rabbit muscle,

00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:43.650
so it's proteins at the beginning

00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:47.060
is residing in the membrane.

00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:50.430
So the membrane is dissolved
by adding detergent

00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:53.015
so the detergent now sort of substitutes

00:39:53.015 --> 00:39:54.720
the phospholipids' here access.

00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:58.868
There are two ways, and
using using detergent only,

00:39:58.868 --> 00:40:02.820
you may be able to make
crystal like this one.

00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:05.400
It's completely different from

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:09.930
the original alignment in the membrane.

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:14.780
But, what we do is adding...

00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:17.285
what you would call phosphatidyl choline.

00:40:17.285 --> 00:40:20.140
Phosphatidyl choline is a sort of major

00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:23.370
phospholipid in the membrane.

00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:27.223
And make a kind of
reconstitution like this one.

00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:32.330
And at the beginning or in
the history of a membrane

00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:36.460
protein crystallization,
this is the one first made by

00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:40.770
Michel and he got the Nobel
Prize and he mentioned

00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:43.060
that this one is not very good because

00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:46.773
you cannot make large enough crystals.

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:53.900
But so nobody actually succeeded
in making good crystals

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:57.050
of calcium ATPase as in pump proteins,

00:40:57.050 --> 00:41:02.050
but we have managed to make
crystals by sort of adding the

00:41:02.563 --> 00:41:06.203
phospholipid and kind of
making kind of reconstitution.

00:41:06.203 --> 00:41:11.023
So this is a crystal of a calcium ATPase.

00:41:13.883 --> 00:41:15.920
Calcium pump proteins.

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:18.980
And this is a cross-section made by...

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:22.610
electron microscopy.

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:25.660
And you see the scale is one micrometer.

00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:28.559
And if you look at the
edge of the crystal,

00:41:28.559 --> 00:41:33.037
you see the bilayers sort of stick out,

00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:38.650
and make a funny loops.

00:41:38.650 --> 00:41:41.012
And even funnier ones here.

00:41:41.012 --> 00:41:45.150
You see the end of the
crystals the lipid barrier

00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:46.710
can cause this like that.

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:50.400
And clearly shows that our crystal

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:53.990
rarely have membrane like environment.

00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:58.300
So we consider that the crystal,

00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:01.560
the proteins in the crystal maintain

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:05.250
this sort of native
conditions, native structures.

00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:10.250
So the actual picture of
the pump protein, like this.

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:14.260
So this is so-called
CPK or space fill model,

00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:18.780
so they each, they are after
the structure determination,

00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:23.180
we determine to coordinate
of all the heavy atoms,

00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:24.650
heavy atoms means that they

00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:27.913
are heavier than the carbon atoms.

00:42:29.985 --> 00:42:34.985
So if you represent each atom
with its (mumbles) perhaps,

00:42:40.503 --> 00:42:44.730
Then you can make sort of
most accurate in terms of

00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:49.730
the space or volume, like this one.

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:53.070
But you don't see any sort
of chemical bond here.

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:57.460
You don't know how this
model and the amino acids

00:42:57.460 --> 00:42:59.220
are interacting at all.

00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:02.030
So then, once sort of...

00:43:03.347 --> 00:43:07.340
One level of abstraction is using

00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:09.680
so-called ball and stick model.

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:14.190
So now, each atom is presented
by single ball but the size

00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:18.163
is much smaller than the actual size.

00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:24.180
But we can show the chemical
bond, covalent bond by sticks.

00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:28.918
So you see the spaces
here if you consider that

00:43:28.918 --> 00:43:33.918
actual protein is full of spaces
or vacuum, that's not true.

00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:39.450
Its real shape is like this,
but to understand the protein

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:42.660
structure we use this
kind of abstractions.

00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:47.660
And still, we don't see
the structure so easily.

00:43:48.010 --> 00:43:50.790
The next abstraction is using

00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:54.170
the so-called secondary structure.

00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:58.500
It's a kind of building block of proteins.

00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:03.500
And this spirals called
alpha-helix and sort of kind,

00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:05.330
It's sort of a...

00:44:07.590 --> 00:44:09.803
considered kind of cylinders.

00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:15.392
And here you see the
kind of ribbons, sorry,

00:44:15.392 --> 00:44:18.160
arrows like this one, this one is called

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:22.560
beta-sheet and so it's
the protein structure,

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:27.560
you can consider that, the
proteins consists of sheets

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.833
and cylinders and
connecting groups, right.

00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:37.440
So this is perhaps the easiest way to...

00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:42.410
represent the actual protein structures.

00:44:42.410 --> 00:44:46.503
Let's think about how the pumps the

00:44:47.453 --> 00:44:51.233
calcium ATPase should look like.

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:55.403
And we know that this is ATP powered pump,

00:44:56.947 --> 00:45:01.947
and the sum calculation I didn't show,

00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:05.800
but it's effect the energy usage

00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:09.320
is almost about 100% efficient.

00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:12.930
And it must have a specific specificity

00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:17.533
because it's a calcium pump,
it should not pump sodium,

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:24.500
for example, or potassium, and
so it must have a mechanism

00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:27.623
for rejecting sodium and other ions.

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:33.690
And it needs two gates,
I'll explain here soon.

00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:38.320
It must be cytoplasmic and
this is called lumenal gate,

00:45:39.713 --> 00:45:42.236
lumen because this is a vesicular system

00:45:42.236 --> 00:45:45.736
and inside of the vesicle is called lumen.

00:45:46.609 --> 00:45:47.883
So cytoplasmic and lumen gate must exist

00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:52.750
somewhere here, right.

00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:55.520
The chemical reaction reaction should

00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:57.590
take place somewhere in the cytoplasm

00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:01.880
because ATP cannot go through
the transmembrane path,

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:04.310
because it's a highly charged molecule.

00:46:04.310 --> 00:46:09.260
So, somewhere in this cytoplasmic region,

00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:11.550
the chemical reaction should take place.

00:46:11.550 --> 00:46:13.800
That chemical reaction
has to be transferred

00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:18.653
or transmitted to a gating
system somewhere in the membrane.

00:46:20.050 --> 00:46:25.050
So and my point is the structure
should explain these things

00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:32.470
by and I go back to these gate things.

00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:38.010
If, because this pump should work against

00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:42.369
concentration gradient
if it has only one gate,

00:46:42.369 --> 00:46:47.369
then there's a chance
it's when this gate opens

00:46:48.339 --> 00:46:53.339
if the other gate is open,
then the some ions can go,

00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:56.430
should be able to go through

00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:58.890
and following the concentration gradient.

00:46:58.890 --> 00:47:01.453
That should not happen, right.

00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:06.450
To prevent that, we at
least need another gate

00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:09.623
so we must have a two-gate system.

00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:16.580
Conventionally, the
pump action is explained

00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:20.533
by this type E1/E2 theory
of calcium transport,

00:47:25.135 --> 00:47:28.460
and the E1 form, the
cytoplasm gate is open,

00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:30.910
and the calcium can get
in to transmembrane gate,

00:47:33.392 --> 00:47:36.220
transmembrane calcium binding site.

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:39.030
The calcium binding site
must have a higher affinity

00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:46.403
and if one finds ATP bind here,

00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:52.890
it must be allowed to split
into phosphate and ATP

00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:57.810
and this phosphate is transferred

00:47:57.810 --> 00:48:02.720
from ATP to a protein cell.

00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:07.720
And during this process, this gate,

00:48:08.350 --> 00:48:11.950
cytoplasm gate, becomes closed.

00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:14.703
It forms a so-called ground state.

00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:21.660
And this way the ATP triggers
the change of the structure

00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:27.430
and the other side of the gate will open,

00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:30.530
that's called lumenal gate opens.

00:48:30.530 --> 00:48:34.310
Then the calcium will
be released like this.

00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:40.680
This by release of this
phosphate, so in this case,

00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:44.163
hydrolysis of phosphorate,
actually aqueous phosphate.

00:48:48.067 --> 00:48:48.900
And there is a phosphate release

00:48:52.286 --> 00:48:53.119
and the lumenal gate closes, right.

00:48:56.820 --> 00:49:00.937
Then the sort of automated isomerization

00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:06.830
of structure change, actually
perhaps triggered by protons

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:13.060
and find the calcium released.

00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:17.780
There are lots of protons
inside the lumenal area

00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:21.360
and the proton can get
into this binding site and

00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:26.360
sort of neutralize the charge
imbalance created by calcium.

00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:34.720
But we know that neutral pH
these protons are released

00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:40.100
and make this calcium
binding site higher affinity.

00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:46.883
So this is a cycle and
classically you want this form

00:49:49.197 --> 00:49:53.300
which has a higher affinity
and open to cytoplasm.

00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:58.300
And it is true to some extent,
but there is a position

00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:04.640
which has a state in which
both gates are closed.

00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:09.470
So we can't say there is the E1 state

00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:12.163
is open to the cytoplasm.

00:50:13.794 --> 00:50:16.540
Perhaps the correct definition,

00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:19.410
the E1 has a, the E1 form is a higher

00:50:19.410 --> 00:50:21.970
affinity form for calcium.

00:50:21.970 --> 00:50:24.540
And the E2 form is the same.

00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:28.300
The classical definition
of E2, and if you look

00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:32.170
at the textbook, E2 form
is mainly defined as

00:50:32.170 --> 00:50:37.170
low affinity to calcium but open to lumen.

00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:41.740
It is true, but only in this state.

00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:44.781
In other E2 state is closed.

00:50:44.781 --> 00:50:48.610
So, new definition perhaps
the most accurate definition

00:50:48.610 --> 00:50:53.610
is E2 form is has a low
affinity to calcium.

00:50:56.710 --> 00:50:59.623
I hope you don't sort of get confused.

00:51:01.230 --> 00:51:05.240
Anyway, the key thing is here, this end

00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:09.640
in this cycle, the two
gates sort of regulated

00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:19.443
No state in this reaction
cycle, both gates are open.

00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:23.860
So, in this state, both gates are closed,

00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:28.860
and the other state, the only
one state one gate are closed.

00:51:29.170 --> 00:51:34.013
And the actual pumping
process is done by changing

00:51:34.013 --> 00:51:37.720
the affinity of binding site

00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:40.123
from high affinity to low affinity.

00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:46.980
So I hope I can make
structure sort of explanation

00:51:47.778 --> 00:51:50.945
for this (mumbles)...

00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:55.690
this is a kind of appetizer
for tomorrow's talk

00:51:55.690 --> 00:52:00.690
and by making crystals of many
sort of intermediate states

00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:05.863
you can make this kind of movies.

00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:14.660
This movie actually made from
seven crystal structures.

00:52:14.850 --> 00:52:18.050
And then there's an intermediate
states are generally

00:52:18.050 --> 00:52:22.150
devised of simple interpolation so it's,

00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:27.020
I don't say this is an accurate movement,

00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:31.510
but it gives you lots of insight into how

00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:34.490
the pumps here works.

00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:39.490
From these things we can ask why the

00:52:39.623 --> 00:52:44.623
movement you saw here is
so large and I'll show you

00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:46.700
the top of things the calcium's purpose,

00:52:49.179 --> 00:52:53.210
the calciums bind to
binding site and or get out.

00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:56.050
And the ATP comes out and
so for the calcium to get

00:52:56.050 --> 00:53:01.050
in here, and get out soon.

00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:05.614
Helices and the gate closes access,

00:53:05.614 --> 00:53:10.260
but just to see the movement
so large and complicated.

00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:12.600
And why such large and complicated

00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:14.960
domain movements are necessary?

00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:19.960
And we know that is related
to chemical reaction rate,

00:53:20.010 --> 00:53:21.709
ATPate Hydrolysis.

00:53:21.709 --> 00:53:24.470
What does ATP do?

00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:29.399
And as I mentioned before,
the hydrolysis of ATP

00:53:29.399 --> 00:53:34.123
occurs, it's the gamma
phosphate is transferred to

00:53:34.123 --> 00:53:37.123
proteins so it's
so-called phosphorylation.

00:53:37.970 --> 00:53:40.120
So what does phosphorylation do?

00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:43.163
Why is phosphorus
necessary, or when the final

00:53:43.163 --> 00:53:46.203
overall reaction is just ATP hydrolysis?

00:53:48.850 --> 00:53:51.790
I think I should stop here today.

00:53:51.790 --> 00:53:53.563
Thank you very much for your attention.

00:53:53.563 --> 00:53:55.813
(applause)

00:54:00.292 --> 00:54:02.050
- [Guest] Thank you for a
very interesting lecture,

00:54:02.050 --> 00:54:04.930
I had a question, I came
in a bit late so maybe

00:54:04.930 --> 00:54:06.610
you answered it already, but I'm not sure.

00:54:06.610 --> 00:54:10.680
In neuroscience, it's very
helpful to use calcium

00:54:11.690 --> 00:54:14.620
images to look at what's
happening in active

00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:18.000
nervous systems, and the
time scale of the calcium

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.980
images is much longer than
the millisecond time scale

00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:24.890
of the action potentials,
so I was wondering

00:54:24.890 --> 00:54:26.990
if you could say what determines

00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:28.830
the time scale in this case?

00:54:28.830 --> 00:54:33.123
Is it the entrance of
calcium or what mechanism?

00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:38.660
- Well, so that depends on the

00:54:41.130 --> 00:54:43.183
interaction with the fluorescent dye.

00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:47.611
it's a curator of calcium,
and the affinity is much

00:54:47.611 --> 00:54:52.000
higher usually than to water molecule.

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.420
And what I mentioned is
the substitution rate of

00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:59.177
water molecules and in the
water molecules detach in the,

00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:05.480
well I got back to here.

00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:10.480
It's between the nanosecond
to 10 nanosecond range.

00:55:11.038 --> 00:55:13.880
But this is in the case
of water molecules.

00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:18.180
And it's much different
if you look at sort of

00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:23.180
tight binding made by
fluorescent dye curators.

00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:27.093
Does that make your question,
answer to your question?

00:55:27.093 --> 00:55:28.780
- [Guest] I think in
begins to answer, yes.

00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:33.290
So it's a necessary aspect of
connecting to the dye, right?

00:55:33.290 --> 00:55:34.672
- Mm-hmm, yes.

00:55:34.672 --> 00:55:36.350
- [Guest] And would have
to be very clever to think

00:55:36.350 --> 00:55:37.813
of a faster way, I suppose.

00:55:38.966 --> 00:55:40.600
- Thanks.

00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:43.140
- [Man] There's also a sodium pump,

00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:48.090
and if this pump transfers charge,

00:55:48.090 --> 00:55:50.120
why do we need two
different kinds of pumps,

00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:51.793
a sodium pump and calcium pump?

00:55:53.938 --> 00:55:55.550
- Sorry, say it again.

00:55:55.550 --> 00:55:58.557
- [Man] Sodium pump is responsible for the

00:55:58.557 --> 00:56:01.400
(crosstalk drowns out
speaker) action potential.

00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:04.240
- Sodium Potassium, but not Calcium.

00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:07.560
- Yes, but what's the distinction?

00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:10.630
Why are there two
separate pumping actions,

00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:13.020
one for sodium and one for calcium?

00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:15.133
It seems you could use one pump for both.

00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:18.320
- Well for the specificity you cannot.

00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:23.033
Because it has to for
the sodium and calcium,

00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:28.770
requires different environment, right.

00:56:28.770 --> 00:56:32.230
Okay, so the sodium is a monovalent ion,

00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:34.950
the calcium is divalent ions, right.

00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:37.147
So in the case of divalent ions

00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:41.603
the surrounding oxygen atoms are...

00:56:44.910 --> 00:56:47.762
some of the oxygen atom
has negative charges,

00:56:47.762 --> 00:56:50.380
and the negative charges should match

00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:54.190
the positive charges on the calcium,

00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:58.080
so it should match the charge itself.

00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:01.022
So the calcium binding site can sort of

00:57:01.022 --> 00:57:04.363
cannot have a high affinity to sodium.

00:57:06.213 --> 00:57:10.863
It's the same thing applies
for the sodium bond.

00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:18.180
So although the size is
different to make high affinity,

00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:23.453
to calcium for example, it
cannot be the sodium pump,

00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:29.833
because it cannot make
high affinity sodium.

00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:34.040
- [Man] Right.

00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:37.413
- So it's just a charge
balance in this case.

00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:40.530
(applause)

00:57:44.086 --> 00:57:47.669
