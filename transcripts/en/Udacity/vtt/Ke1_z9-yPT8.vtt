00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.790
All right. Now for a little fun exercise.

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.700
If data that we needed to store

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.320
included images or other binary data,

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.500
how would we store it?

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.900
Would we put the raw data
in the database?

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.470
Would we store files
into a public folder on the device?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.690
Or would we store the files
in a private folder

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.790
and reference the location
in the database?
