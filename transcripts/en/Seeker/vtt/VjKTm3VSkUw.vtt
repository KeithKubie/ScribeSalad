00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.470
Mosquitoes are the worst.

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:04.839
They’re a complete waste of biomass and
they’re annoying.

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:08.929
And now, private companies want to decimate
the mosquito population by releasing millions

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:11.230
of modified mosquitoes into the wild.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.309
True story.

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:14.389
Mosquitoes are one of the deadliest animals
on earth.

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.930
The World Health Organization’s 1996 World
Health Report said 2.7 million deaths annually

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.990
could be pegged to these suckers.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.080
It’s since dropped, but solid numbers are
hard to find, with some saying it’s now

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.570
only several hundred thousand -- which is
still a lot.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.660
Of course, mosquitoes don’t kill people
directly.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.450
Nobody's ever been sucked bone dry by a swarm
of mosquitoes outside of the B-movie horror

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.760
script I’m writing.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.329
Mosquitoes kill so many people, because they’re
carriers of diseases like malaria, dengue,

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.329
and zika.

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:45.400
They’re also really hard to control.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.280
We can’t just pesticide them into oblivion
because we’ll kill a lot of other bugs indiscriminately

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.100
and damage the ecosystem.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.500
And we can't just eliminate where they breed
because they breed in standing water.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.890
We can't just drain every puddle, everywhere.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.210
It's totally impractical.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.740
So we need a different approach.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.370
A couple different companies have come up
with basically the same idea.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.330
Verily, is owned by Alphabet, Google’s parent
company, and Oxitec is owned by a biotech

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.390
firm in Virginia, Intrexon.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.390
6.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.789
Verily had the idea to breed their own mosquitoes
of the species Aedes aegypti, the ones that

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:19.259
carry several diseases that infect humans.

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.729
Their mosquitoes aren’t like wild mosquitoes…
because they carry Wolbachia, a naturally

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.670
occurring bacteria found in up to 60% of insect
species, but, interestingly, not usually in

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.670
Aedes aegypti.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.700
Verily’s plan is to condition the bacteria
to live in the mosquitos and then infect a

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.210
bunch of males with it.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.990
Then, they want to release these male Wolbachia-mosquitoes
by the millions.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.990
Don’t freak out.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.990
Hang on a sec.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.950
When these wolba-squitoes are released into
the wild they still go out and try and get

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.150
busy, but the bacteria renders their sperm
incompatible with the non-infected female

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.150
eggs.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.649
Get enough males who are firing blanks and
you can nearly wipe out the next generation,

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.549
reducing mosquito populations -- and thereby
infection rates!

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:00.549
BOOM.

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.130
Ok, so here's why you shouldn't freak out
at the release of millions of mosquitoes...

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.109
it doesn’t mean more itchy-time…

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:10.680
Little mosquito-101: Males don’t bite, only
females do.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.990
So, the other biotech company Oxitec, has
also created male mosquitoes.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.660
Their mosquitos do hatch, but don’t live
long enough to breed for themselves.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.780
Causing populations to drop.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.190
Oxitec has released their brand of mosquito
in areas of Brazil, Panama, and the Cayman

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.720
islands, which caused the local mosquito populations
to nosedive, sometimes by as much as 90%.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.640
However, when Oxitec tried to release their
mosquitoes in Florida in 2016, they hit a

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.220
stumbling block.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.430
Some local residents didn’t want them, and
campaigned vehemently against them, because

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.890
unlike Verily’s mosquitoes, which again,
are infected with bacteria, Oxitec’s are

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.510
genetically modified.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.140
One commonly cited fear was that a person
bitten by a GMO mosquito would be harmed by

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.000
the added DNA, which is not how any of this
works.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.170
The genetically modified mosquitoes are male,
so they don’t bite, and the offspring they

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.710
make don’t reach an age where they can bite
and reproduce themselves.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.290
But even if they did bite you, there’s never
been a case of a mosquito gene by itself harming

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.290
a human.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.970
Oxitec eventually did release their mosquitoes
in Florida, but because of public mistrust

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.900
of the words “genetically” and ”modified,”
Verily’s Wolbachia infected buzzers may

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.910
be the method that wins the public over.

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.780
But both these methods aren’t long term
solutions.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.840
They’ll temporarily cause the population
to drop a lot, but over time the mosquitoes

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.930
will come back.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.550
Interestingly, once scientists infected mosquitoes
with Wolbachia -- not something that would

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.100
normally happen, remember -- they found a
beneficial side-effect…

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.140
The wolba-squitoes are a bad hosts for the
dengue virus!

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.460
For some reason, if a wolba-squito was also
infected with dengue -- the virus didn’t

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.560
replicate very well, scientists are still
trying to figure out why…

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.200
This means if scientists infect whole species
with wolbachia they can knock back dengue!

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.960
But then… the male wolba-squitoes can breed
with the female wolba-squitoes and we’re

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.620
back to square one with everything that’s
not dengue.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.450
Even still, all these solutions are being
explored to try and stop this stupid deadly

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.980
insect from killing people all over the world.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.680
Maybe someday they’ll all have wolbachia,
stopping dengue, but we’ll have another

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.079
way to make some of them sterile!

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.509
Mosquitoes suck.

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:27.890
Mosquitoes are such pests it’s tempting
to wipe all of them out, but what kind of

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.569
impact would that have on the environment.

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.129
Natalia Reagan and I talk about that right
here.

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:33.129
So how do you feel about this?

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:36.710
Would you be cool if a company decided to
release millions of mosquitos in your neighborhood?
