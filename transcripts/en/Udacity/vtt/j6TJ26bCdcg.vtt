The absolute value of -3 is 3.

00:00:03.953 --> 00:00:08.070
And the absolute value of -2 is 2.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.190
Remember, absolute value is
the distance away from zero, and

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.990
it can't be negative.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:21.130
So the sum of the absolute value of
-3 and the absolute value of -2 is 5.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.875
That's because this is
the same thing as saying 3+2.

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:30.249
