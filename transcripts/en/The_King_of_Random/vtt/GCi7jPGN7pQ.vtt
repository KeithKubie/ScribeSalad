00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.100
Are we doing this?

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.720
Yep.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.501
Today, we're taking one of the
most popular drinks in America,

00:00:06.501 --> 00:00:07.720
a Starbucks Latte,

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.100
and seeing what happens
if we dry it out completely.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:17.420
[Music]

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.000
Hey guys, I'm Nate.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.100
Calli.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.120
I'm Calli.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.140
We've got another fun
experiment for you today.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.920
We've dehydrated a
few things before,

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:31.368
and today, we are taking
on a very popular drink.

00:00:31.368 --> 00:00:33.520
So today, we've got
a Starbucks latte,

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.800
and we're going to see
what happens if we dry it out.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.840
It's a simple idea.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.320
We're going to pour the entire
contents of one Starbucks latte

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.497
into our dehydrator,

00:00:41.497 --> 00:00:43.775
let it dry out for as
many days as it takes,

00:00:43.775 --> 00:00:45.100
and then see what's left.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.680
We've got our
Dehydro-tron 5,000.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.940
We've got our latte.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.420
Let's learn what happens.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.340
Calli, stop drinking it.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.160
No!

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.740
Calli is going to be our expert
on what this tasted like,

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.360
and you'll probably get
to taste the dried-up bits too.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.960
[Music]

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.380
That would be coffee
with milk in it, right?

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.100
Yeah, steam pressed.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.340
Steam pressed coffee
with milk in it.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.340
[Music]

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.260
Here it goes.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.040
These videos are
no way sponsored

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.699
or endorsed by Starbucks.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.517
I'll plug everything in.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.500
There you go.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.220
It's alive.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.940
All right, we've got
this dehydrating.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.114
It's probably take a couple
of days to really dry out of the way.

00:01:32.114 --> 00:01:33.550
What do you think
is going to happen?

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:34.721
How dry is the question?

00:01:34.721 --> 00:01:35.662
So we've done soda,

00:01:35.662 --> 00:01:37.760
and that ended up
just being like a goo.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.549
Like he was like
a really thick syrup,

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:40.866
like molasses consistency.

00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:41.726
Then we did milk,

00:01:41.726 --> 00:01:43.550
and that like just
completely flaked.

00:01:43.512 --> 00:01:44.367
We were able to put

00:01:44.367 --> 00:01:46.428
that in a blender
and just turn it into dust.

00:01:46.428 --> 00:01:48.413
I'm hoping we get sort
of like a the same thing,

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.760
a powdery consistency?

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.820
Maybe something that's almost
something that we can break.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.160
But that's kind of what I'm
thinking this going to happen.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.560
So maybe we've got one

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.120
that will dry out completely
and be like flaky and dry,

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.132
but even just with
the chocolate milk that we did,

00:02:01.132 --> 00:02:03.637
that had just milk
and powdered chocolate,

00:02:03.637 --> 00:02:06.073
and that still ended up
being just a little bit

00:02:06.073 --> 00:02:08.350
more gummy and flexible
than the plain milk.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.375
So I'm not sure
how it's going to end up.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.220
We'll see.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.300
Let's give it a couple days.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.220
Guys, it's now been a few days,

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.380
and we have led this lot
a dry out, like dry.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.740
Now, it's time to see
what's happened to it.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:21.900
She's very disappointed.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.380
All right, pull that tray out.

00:02:25.392 --> 00:02:26.854
What even happened?

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:27.660
What?

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:31.700
That-- Okay.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.080
So I think we are both wrong.

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.650
You said it was going
to be like crumbly.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.684
I thought it
would be powderized,

00:02:37.684 --> 00:02:38.637
but I'm gonna--

00:02:38.637 --> 00:02:40.100
It's just like a sheet.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.920
What is this?

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.060
Wait...

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.880
I regret everything.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.952
It's not good.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.920
Hmm.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.320
Oh, and it certainly
smells very strongly.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.200
It actually weirdly
didn't smell that strong

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.250
while it was drying out.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.996
I thought it was.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.560
I thought I was going to like
make the whole house smell

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.560
strongly of coffee.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.960
It was pretty mild.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.280
I barely noticed it honestly.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.400
But now, as we're
like breaking it,

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.680
I'm smelling a lot more.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.240
See how much this
we can break out,

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.740
and fit into our mortar
and pestle here.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.240
Have yourself a
very crispy Christmas.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.200
All right.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.000
So especially compared
to the soda,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.900
this is just flaking right off.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.300
Like yes, there
were sugar in this,

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.260
but I think the difference is
probably what, corn syrup?

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.460
Okay, that's interesting.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.560
Around the sides
where it's a little bit thicker,

00:03:31.572 --> 00:03:33.649
it's still kind
of a weird gummy,

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:35.440
less crackly consistency.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.430
So that is pretty much

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.262
what we saw with the milk
and the chocolate milk,

00:03:39.262 --> 00:03:43.420
is that it was too thick,
it didn't dehydrate 100%,

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.800
and it didn't have quite
the same crumbliness.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:54.560
[Music]

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.440
Nope, still tastes awful.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:07.680
[Music]

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.400
All right, pretty well grinded?

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.220
Ground?

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.140
Groundeded.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.800
Pretty well groundeded.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.260
All right, so you're the expert,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.120
and you said this
does not taste good.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.820
It does not taste like a latte.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.280
It doesn't smell like a latte.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.960
It does not taste like a latte.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.800
So I don't drink coffee,

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.980
but I do usually like
the smell of coffee.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.600
This does not really
smell like coffee.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.760
It smells like the coffee
that you leave in the coffee pot

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.260
in the office for like
a day on accident.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:34.380
Gross.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.980
Yeah.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.400
We've got our same cup.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.640
We've got some hot water.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.550
We're going to see if we can turn
this powdered Starbucks back

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.120
into regular Starbucks.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:45.700
Hot water.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.600
This was a 16-ounce latte.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.840
I'm gonna fill up just
a little bit in here.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.440
Let's start with that.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:57.520
[Music]

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.560
It's back to
smelling like coffee.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.780
That looks pretty
much just the same.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.160
So there's a very distinct smell
to Starbucks Coffee.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.300
Anybody who has ever been
in two different coffee shops

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.360
would know it.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.680
How would you describe that?

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.680
To me, that smells like coffee,

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.580
and again, I'm not an expert
by any means,

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.350
but like it does actually
smell like coffee,

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:15.740
instead of like burnt hotdog?

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.140
I don't know what
it smells like before.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.050
It was not pleasant.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.540
Starbucks is known for having
more of a bitter flavor.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.000
Okay, so I didn't
drink that much,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.900
because they did have
my own latte that morning.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:25.900
So...

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.480
That's less water

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.900
than was probably in it when we
poured it into the dehydrator.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.120
I bet there's still unstirred
in stuff at the bottom.

00:05:35.128 --> 00:05:35.906
Yeah, so...

00:05:35.906 --> 00:05:36.656
Okay. Yeah.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.620
Some of it didn't dissolve all the way.
&gt;&gt; That's odd.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:39.400
All right.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.397
We're still going to see
what it tastes like.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.900
So it's probably good that we
don't have quite enough water.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.300
I refuse to drink
Starbucks coffee without the--

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.860
Sippy cup lid?

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.240
That's what makes it taste good.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:49.150
For science?

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.780
For science!

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:50.700
For science!

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.120
[Music]

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.160
That has almost
no flavor at all,

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.460
and I bet it's
because there's still

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.460
some pieces in here that haven't
completely dissolved yet.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.420
It tastes like salty milk.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.220
Salty milk.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.020
There you go.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.180
Dehydrated Starbucks latte,
and reconstitute it,

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.900
and you get salty milk.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.040
Can we blend that?

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.040
Let's see if we can make
this a little bit better.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:19.940
Oh!

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.080
That looks like mud.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.680
Look at that.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.940
I drinked that?

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.720
There's a lot
that has not mixed in it all.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.440
Gross!

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:46.240
[Music]

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.180
You're the one
who gets to drink it,

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.040
so you tell me when you
think it's mixed enough.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.840
More.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:51.440
More.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:52.060
More.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.220
It smells a little better now.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:58.780
Foam on it.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:06:59.880
No.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.320
No!

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.960
I don't know what that is,
but it's an abomination.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.820
All right, so at least
got the foam off.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.400
Let's do one more--

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.200
One more try.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.720
[Music]

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.000
Describe the terribleness.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.260
Take some milk,
warm it up slightly,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
add like a tablespoon of salt,

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.520
leave it out on the counter
for a few hours,

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.260
and then add like half
a shot of espresso.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.480
That's what I just drank.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.650
So you're saying
it's pretty bad.

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:30.980
I regret everything.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.160
Guys, don't dehydrate Starbucks.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:39.060
But if you do dehydrate Starbucks,
don't try and reconstitute the Starbucks.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:41.720
One of the most popular
projects we have ever had

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.540
on our channel to showing
how to build a laser blowgun,

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.380
and we have turned that
into a kit that you can order,

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:47.380
and if you act quickly,

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:48.860
you can still get it
in time for Christmas.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.400
That kit comes with everything
you could possibly need.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.720
We have got a glue gun,
PVC pipes, decals, a laser,

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.380
everything that you need for
your own backyard adventures.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.840
So my initial reaction,

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.600
the second that we open
those kits was just

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.340
how much we provided for you.

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.457
It's nearly everything
that you need,

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.180
and its amazing quality.

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.160
It's really fun.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.620
We didn't help plan this out.

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:09.786
So when we opened it,
it really was just

00:08:09.786 --> 00:08:11.920
like us getting the kit
for the first time.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:13.140
I was especially impressed

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.100
that it comes like with a glue
gun and glue sticks and stuff.

00:08:15.101 --> 00:08:16.149
I was not expecting that.

00:08:16.149 --> 00:08:18.880
Everything you need,
it takes probably, what?

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.960
15 to 30 minutes depending

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.480
how quickly were working to get
your blow gun up and ready,

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.840
and then maybe
a little bit longer

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.380
if you're trying
to fine-tune the laser,

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.820
which it even comes
with everything for that.

00:08:28.838 --> 00:08:30.450
Like to zero in that laser.

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:31.900
So it's perfectly accurate.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.740
It worked crazy well.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:34.740
I also really like the fact that

00:08:34.743 --> 00:08:36.172
although it comes
with the supplies

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:38.120
and equipment to make
the nail darts,

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.660
with like the paper cone
at the back,

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:40.800
it's like the perfect size

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.136
that you can use
miniature marshmallows,

00:08:42.136 --> 00:08:43.109
and so you can have

00:08:43.109 --> 00:08:46.850
like a laser assisted
marshmallow blow gun fight.

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:51.620
Or blowgun marshmallow wars
in your kitchen or studio.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.360
There might still be
marshmallows all over the place.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:08:59.860
Possible.

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:00.720
Just maybe.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.420
We've got a couple
hundred in stock,

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:04.120
but we do expect
them to go fast.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:04.980
So if you want for yourself,

00:09:04.988 --> 00:09:07.950
for a friend or family member,
now is the time to get it.

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:09.630
If you guys decide to go all out

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:11.620
and bedazzle one
of these things,

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:14.360
or just make it look really
really cool, we want to see.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:15.460
Send us pictures.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:16.920
There's lots of ways
you can decorate.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:17.640
You can use paint.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.360
You can use tape.

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:19.840
I guess, you could
use a bedazzler

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.600
if you really want gems,

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.720
and rhinestones.
&gt;&gt; What is a bedazzlers?

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.000
It puts like rhinestones on it.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.520
I don't know
if it works on PVC,

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.750
but someone should figure out
how to make that work.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:32.580
Anyway, lots of ways to make
this blowgun your own,

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:34.540
modifying what we
have in the kit,

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:35.460
very cool stuff.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.780
The link for one of these kits
is in the description.

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:38.560
Have fun.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:39.120
Be safe.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.300
Build something cool.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:41.820
Guys, that's not all,

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.240
