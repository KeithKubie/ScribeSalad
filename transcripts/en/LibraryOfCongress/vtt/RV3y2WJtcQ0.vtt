00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:18.070
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.530
&gt;&gt; Ryan Moore: Good
morning, everyone.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.050
We're going to begin today's event.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.480
Welcome to the Library of Congress.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.180
This event is sponsored by the
Philip Lee Phillips Map Society,

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.170
it's the friends group of the
geography and map division.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.030
My name's Ryan Moore.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.060
I am a specialist in the division

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.330
and I am also the Executive
Secretary of the Phillips Society.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.360
And today, we are happy to
present Islands in the Stream,

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.110
lecture by Julio Cesar
Perez Hernandez.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.240
And, also on the screen, I just
want you to take note of some

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.040
of the other activities that
the Society is involved with.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.840
Our latest publication is by Louis
De Vorsey, it's called The History

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.070
of the Gulf Stream's Missing
Chapter, a very interesting piece

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.180
that discusses who actually
discovered the Gulf Stream.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.870
Benjamin Franklin is assumed to
have discovered the Gulf Stream

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.570
and understood it scientifically.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.260
This author makes a
different argument about that.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.150
Very interesting piece,
it's available in the back

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.720
and it's also available online
where you see loc.gov/phillips.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.510
You can download the color
PDF and read it at home.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.180
Our forthcoming publication
is by Cheryl Fox.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.650
She's an archival specialist
here at the Library of Congress,

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.610
and she's looking into the history
of Philip Lee Phillips himself.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:55.130
He began some overseas
acquisitions trips in 1905

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.860
and this was the beginning
when the Library

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.340
of Congress actually was going
out into Europe and other places

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.530
to bring things back to make this
library a world-class library,

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.200
in competition with
France and England.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.850
This was is the time of Teddy
Roosevelt, this is the time

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.100 position:56%
when the United States was
extending itself into Latin America,

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.140
and the library saw itself as
part of that larger mission

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.160
to be a status symbol worldwide.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.100
It's a very interesting piece.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:34.310
So, the last piece I have to say
today is that this event is brought

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.840
to you by a group of donors
that was established in 1995,

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.700
by Chief Ralph Ehrenberg
who is here, somewhere.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:50.130
And these group of folks are very
interested in collecting maps,

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.450
history of maps, and discussing
maps, and not just maps alone,

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.380
but maps as a window
to discuss the world.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.420
Their donations make this possible.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.340
If you're not a member of the
Society, it has 400 people

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.580
and institutions together
contributing,

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.680
we ask you to consider joining.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.730
No contribution is too
small and I assure you,

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.100
no contribution is too large.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.180
We are very happy to work with
you if you are in that camp.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.740
So please see me or see the Chief.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.030
So, without further adieu,
I would like to bring

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.120
up a colleague of mine,
Anthony Mullan.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.410
He is an expert in Latin
American maps, the Caribbean,

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.990
and the Iberian Peninsula, and he's
going to kick things off today.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.510
So, without further adieu,
please welcome Mr. Mullan.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.510
[ Applause ]

00:03:45.510 --> 00:04:00.110
[ Silence ]

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.100
&gt;&gt; Anthony Paez Mullan:
Thank you, Ryan.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.040
It is a great pleasure for me

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.970
to introduce Julio Cesar Perez
Hernandez to this audience.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.600
Today, Mr. Perez Hernandez
will present us

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.520
with an historical overview
of Cuba, through the medium

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.830
of maps, plans, and engravings.

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.400
Mr. Perez Hernandez is an
international consultant

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.400
and world-class expert in Cuban
architecture and urbanism.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.470
He is a scholar and author
of several articles, books,

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.120
and forthcoming works
on architecture

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.630
and urban design in Cuba.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.200
He received his degree in
architecture from the School

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.330
of Architecture at the University
of Havana in 1982, where he served

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.860
as adjunct professor
from 1998 to 2006.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.190
He undertook advanced
study as a Fellow

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.310
at Harvard University Graduate
School of Design in 2002,

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.000
and in 2013 he returned to
Harvard as a visiting scholar.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.150
As a recognized architect,
urban planner, and consultant,

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.090
he has developed and worked
on designs and projects

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.390
in the US, Europe and Cuba.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.520
His works have not only included
commercial, new commercial,

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.470
cultural, and residential projects,
but also historic preservation.

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.550
Today, Mr. Perez Hernandez
will narrate a history

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.360
of Cuba using maps,
plans, and engravings.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.500
And he will conclude by
discussing his publication,

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.280 position:56%
Master Plan for 21st Century Havana,

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.030
that describes a comprehensive
urban project

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.090
for the future redevelopment
of Havana.

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.790
And before turning the program over
to our speaker, I would like --

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.670
I would briefly like to turn your
attention to our extensive holdings

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.590
of cartographic material for Latin
America, the Caribbean region,

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.770
and the Iberian Peninsula.

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.230
A few statistics will suffice
to demonstrate the breath

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.130
and depth of the collection.

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.140 position:56%
The geography and map division holds
more than 1000 manuscript plans,

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:04.760
1000 manuscript plans, maps,
and atlases alone related

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:11.100 position:56%
to Latin America, the Caribbean, and
the Iberian world from 1550 to 1900.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.850
Of these, that is of the manuscript
materials, 81 are manuscript maps

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:19.200
or plans of Cuban bays,
harbors, towns, or cities,

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:24.830
mostly from the 18th century,
but not, not, not entirely.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.660
In addition, the division possesses
more than 140 uncatalogued maps

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.420
of Cuba, covering the
period from 1896 to 1925.

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.590
For those of you don't know
much about Cuban history,

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.320
this was a very important period.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.490
During these 30 years, there
was the Spanish-American war,

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.730
there was also the
independence from Spain,

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.760
Cuba's independence from Spain.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:54.670
And from the same time period,
the geography map division holds,

00:06:54.670 --> 00:07:00.290
holds 42 catalog maps
and plans of Cuba.

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:05.010 position:56%
And the division continues to review
dealers' catalogs and offerings

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:08.390
for other cartographic material,
significant to the understanding

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:12.450
of Latin American and
Caribbean history and culture.

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:19.230
Our most recent acquisition to
date is a large manuscript map

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:25.340
that we acquired last fall,
which is a map from 1811,

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.920 position:56%
which shows Louisiana, Spanish
Texas and the Trans-Mississippi West

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.800
which was prepared by
Father Jose Antonio Pichardo

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.960
and that was prepared for the
Spanish viceroy of New Spain

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.240
to determine where the
boundary line should be drawn

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.040
between the United
States and Mexico.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:45.510 position:56%
And now, I'd like to turn the
program over to Mr. Perez Hernandez.

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:49.920
[ Applause ]

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.360
&gt;&gt; Julio Cesar Perez Hernandez:
Good afternoon, everybody.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:57.330
There's so many things that I can
say when I'm in Washington, DC,

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:01.960
a city that I love, not only
because it's the capital of the US,

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:06.930
but it's just that it's one of the
most beautiful cities in the world,

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:09.800
not only the US but
in the whole world.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.050
So, I am very pleased and
honored to be here and I would

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:16.840
like to thank you for
joining me in this adventure,

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.510
in this journey this afternoon.

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:25.300
I am particularly grateful
to the US Library of Congress

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.860 position:56%
and it's geography and map division.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:37.010
Mr. Ralph Ehrenberg, the Chief
of the division, also Ryan Moore,

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:44.500
Diane Schug-O'Neill, people have
been in touch with since last year.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:50.200
And the very origin of this
lecture is this building where I,

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:55.340
where I came to request
authorization

00:08:55.340 --> 00:09:01.190
for using a special map for the
book I'm currently working on.

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:04.080
I was particularly honored
and pleased to come here

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.610
with my dear friend, Leonard Hacker

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:09.600
and his lovely wife
Naomi [assumed spelling].

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:14.260
And we had a wonderful time thanks
to the kindness, extreme kindness

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:18.450
of Chief Ralph Ehrenberg,
who we just met.

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:23.160
Meeting people like Mr.
Ehrenberg in this sort

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:28.380
of institution confirms
how great this country is

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:32.150
and how well represented
it is by its institutions.

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:35.620
So thank you for being here.

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:37.440
I hope that you enjoy.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:44.950
I am also grateful to, very much
to again Diane Schug-O'Neill,

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:48.550
for her kindness in
sending me the, the maps.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:51.060
It treasure them, Diane.

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:52.360
Thank you.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:57.880
So, the lecture slide show is
also very much related to the US

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.900
and the US history
and the US literature.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:06.390
"Islands in the Stream" was the
title of Hemingway's last novel.

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:14.030
As you know, Hemingway lived in
Cuba for some time and several

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:17.380
of his writings happened there.

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:21.070
First, in 1928, when he
first arrived in Havana

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:24.810
at the Ambos Mundos Hotel
and then after the long time,

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:28.390
he spent I think a year in
the outskirts of Havana,

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:31.920
after his wife purchased
the property for him

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.150
to peacefully write there.

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:38.580
Hemingway used to fish also in
the waters of the Caribbean,

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:46.530
and at some point he was even
pursuing Nazi submarines there,

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:50.450
so it's another interesting
topic for any other lecture.

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:52.220
Hemingway and Cuba we could make.

00:10:52.220 --> 00:11:01.920
But then, the background of this
picture is this famous 1500 map

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.220
by Juan de la Cosa, the first map

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:08.380
that confirmed that
Cuba was an island.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:13.370
I'm here to talk about Cuba,
of course, but I'm here to talk

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:15.760
about the world and
the world of maps.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:20.090
The key to understand
the history of the,

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:24.610 position:56%
of the world is the history of maps.

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:29.580
So maps bring people together,
maps help understand the world,

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:33.080
and there was a time when
maps made the difference.

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:39.090
I'm talking about that time when
the Europeans mastered the oceans,

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:41.120
especially the Portuguese.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:49.070
And this is to show you that
this guy, Martin Waldseemuller,

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:52.360
whose map I'm showing you,
this is the one I was looking

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:56.610 position:56%
for when I came here last September,
reflected the island of Cuba

00:11:56.610 --> 00:12:03.050
in his 1507 map too,
just several years,

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:06.990
seven years after Juan
de la Cosa did.

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:13.870
And Waldseemuller also made a
mistake, and the mistake consisted

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:18.010
in naming America, America.

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:23.420
So, we're here today, this will
start a fight some years later

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:30.230
and I will let you know about it,
and he, he was aware of his mistake

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:33.080
because he tried to mend
it, he tried to fix that,

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:37.130
but at the time he was trying to do
that, it was impossible to do just

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:39.220
because of the increase of prints.

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:44.890
So, everybody would name
America this whole continent and,

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:52.500
and it took some time, as I said,
to clarify, and in fact, centuries.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:58.070
And, this is where Cuba is
shown, here's Carta Marina,

00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:02.810
it says Terra de Cuba
here, Land of Cuba.

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:09.770
And, but again, I would like to
refer to Columbus' background,

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:13.450
because if we are here today, we
are here today because of Columbus.

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:15.440
We are here today thanks
to Columbus.

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.730
We are here today thanks
to the Renaissance.

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:21.190
And Columbus, in a
way, was a Renaissance

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:25.820
and benefitted from
his contemporaries.

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:34.760
This is a chart from 1455, the
[inaudible] pareto, pareto chart.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:38.910
Where you see the how the
islands were represented,

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:41.810
not very accurately,
not very precisely.

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:47.540
We can see here this very
enigmatic name of Antille,

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:49.370
which means the anthills.

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:52.180
People also related
the Antille Island

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:58.510
with the disappeared mythical
island that, you know,

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:02.130
is the subject of so
many texts also.

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:08.920
And then, you know, Columbus had
all these cosmographic knowledge

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:13.070
that he accumulated throughout
the years, the years he, you know,

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:14.600
Columbus was from, you know,

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:18.370
Italy but he spent most
of his life in Portugal.

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:27.030
And there, he started to
put together his plan.

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:28.680
Columbus was a visionary.

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:32.080
It takes a visionary, otherwise,
there wouldn't be America,

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.520
we wouldn't be here again.

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:38.830
So, Columbus knew he was, he
made his living as a, as a sailor

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:41.820
but also, as a book trader.

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:45.100
So he knew about books,
among many other things,

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:49.990
so he knew about Imago
Mundi, this book.

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:54.180
He knew also about Toscanelli,
who was a Renaissance man

00:14:54.180 --> 00:15:00.140
who not only researched the
cosmos and taught geometry

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:05.270
to architect Filippo Brunelleschi,
but made this map of the Atlantic

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:09.760
that he sent to the
Portugese king announcing

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:15.780
that there would be a route to
India and China, other than the one

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:19.940
that they knew so far,
meaning that sailing westward,

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:21.450
you could get to the East.

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:25.230
And that's what Columbus
really was aware of.

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:32.130
And Columbus was also aware that
the globe, the earth was rounded,

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:37.910
especially after this
globe was made in 1492.

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:43.000
So, Columbus made several attempts
to convince kings in Portugal

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.230
and Spain for his trip, for his
so-called enterprise of the Indies.

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:50.750
Remember that Columbus
died believing

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:52.190
that he had arrived in India.

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:56.320
This is why he would say that
the aboriginals were Indians.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:01.230
So this is where all the terms
for years came, love the Indies,

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:05.380
and the West Indies, and
all those geographic terms.

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:08.720 position:56%
Yes, geography was key at this time.

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:13.290
So this beautiful stained-glass
is crowning one of the buildings

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:19.250
in Havana, showing and
displaying one of Columbus' trips.

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:22.310
As you know, he sailed
with special ships,

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:24.680
not any ship, but the Caravels.

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:28.410
The Caravels were particularly
good to face the winds.

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:33.160
And Columbus didn't know
about the seas and the winds.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:36.930
You need to know that if you want
to come back, you want to return

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:39.250
to the place you departed
from, otherwise,

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:42.200
you're lost in the
middle of nowhere.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:46.430
So here's what Columbus founded --

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:50.830
sorry, this is what Columbus
found when he arrived in Cuba.

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:56.240 position:56%
He found very peaceful
aboriginals, wearing almost nothing.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:01.760
Which confused him at
first because he contrasted

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:08.840
that with what he had read
from Marco Polo's voyages.

00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:13.390
And he was confused, but still
he couldn't figure it out.

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:19.060
So this is why he took some of
them back to Spain on his trip,

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:21.910
on his first trip back to Spain.

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:25.980
And then this is where
Columbus arrived.

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.660
This very old map.

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:33.610
This is Baracoa in the North East
part of Cuba, where he arrives

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:41.570
on October 12th -- on
October 28th, sorry, of 1492.

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:48.170
This map, the oldest map
depicting Cuba as an island, here,

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:49.840
was done by Juan de la Cosa.

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:54.940
Juan de la Cosa came with
Columbus in his second trip.

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:59.480
So this is from 1500,
it's a treasure.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:03.470
And shows for the first time
that Columbus was mistaken

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:06.840
because he only thought
that the land he had arrived

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:09.480
to was a continent
and not an island.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:15.250
So this was clarified for the
first time by this very old map.

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:19.430
This is also another chart
that, chronologically speaking,

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:26.440 position:56%
you could place after Juan de la
Cosa, and is the famous Cantino map.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:31.670
Here you find also the
island of Dominican Republic,

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:34.510
the current Dominican
Republic and Cuba.

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:39.830 position:56%
With this very picturesque
representation here of South America

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:42.330
and Brazil, that was the trend.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:46.710
Maps, as we know them,
they were pieces of art.

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:48.980
They were ornated,
they were beautiful

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:52.960
as we cannot find current
maps, unfortunately.

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:59.560
So for us, here together
maps are works of art.

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:03.490
And that's what elevates maps
to the special condition.

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:08.160
Well, after Columbus returned,
he brought, as you know,

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:13.020
Diego Velazquez, and conquest and
colonization of America started.

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:18.870
It was a very unprecedented
process of colonization,

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:22.380
only compared to that
of the Roman Empire

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:25.290
that we are going to refer to also.

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:28.060
These tell you about the conditions

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:32.090
and the very precarious
architecture that Columbus found.

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:37.610
And also as how the Spaniards
started to be interested

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:40.770
in extracting the riches
from America.

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:47.090 position:56%
Especially this picture is about the
processing of silver at some point.

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:53.350
In the beginning, especially after
Hernando Cortes went to Mexico,

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:58.790
and that was 1519,
Cuba was neglected

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:03.100
because the Spaniards were very
interested in bringing the riches

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:08.960
from Mexico and Peru, where they
found a very different condition

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.260
from the Caribbean islands.

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:14.890
There was no civilization
that you can recognize as such

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:17.790
in the Caribbean islands,
but there was a civilization

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:19.220
in Mexico and Peru.

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.960
In Peru, the ancient Tiwanaku.

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:24.910
And in Mexico, the
Aztecs and the Mayans.

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:30.450
They had canals, sophisticated and
civilized system of government.

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:33.120
They had temples.

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:39.250
They had a very organized
urban life, as you call.

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:46.240 position:56%
So this is a map showing Christopher
Columbus discoveries during his

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.890
first trip in 1492.

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:53.980
All these islands were Columbus
reward after his long quest

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:59.890
in the ocean and after his
adventurous trip to America.

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:07.680
In the same way, this also chose
how the Spanish settlements were

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.000
abundant in Cuba.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.800
And in fact, some clarification
is needed

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:20.710
because the original Cuban
settlements were settled,

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:25.850
and this is why I'm talking now
about not only the word maps

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:29.870
but also the Cuban cities,
and especially one of them,

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:32.700
which is the capital
of Cuba, Havana.

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:38.560
But for us to understand the
urban condition of Cuban cities,

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:47.550
we need to go back to this very
old map from the 4th, 5th century,

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:50.260
that shows the roads to Rome.

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:55.270
The Roman Empire, they
founded cities

00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:58.770
across the whole Europe
and also in Spain.

00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:02.300
And the very precedents of
Cuban cities are the Roman

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:04.730
camps [inaudible].

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:09.940
They were fortified towns
where there would be streets

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:12.510
in both directions,
meaning there was a grid.

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:17.930
And at some point where this
grid met, there was an open space

00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:22.870
that we can call let's say
the primitive plaza or square.

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:27.540
Then, of course, we find in
Cuba and we find in America,

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:31.530
this very origins of the cities
that date back from the Greek

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:35.380
from [inaudible] and
also from the Romans.

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:40.950
And this is the court, the
center, of these cities and towns

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:45.760
that were representing urban
life and public activities,

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:49.360
first in the Greek Agora
and then in the Roman Forum.

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:56.250
Where you can see certain
organization, spatial organization,

00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:59.030
other than the more
loose Greek type.

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:04.430
So when it comes to the first
Cuban settlements, as I said,

00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:06.670
Columbus arrived first
here in Baracoa,

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:11.210
and Diego Velazquez
founded Baracoa in 1511.

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:16.030
There are different opinions,
different scholarly statements

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:22.650 position:56%
about was it 1511, was it 1512, but
it's most accepted that it was 1511.

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:24.890
So Columbus arrived here.

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:27.750
And if you follow the
grid, you don't find

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:32.870
that this is a perfect grid,
but instead, a very loose one.

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:36.470
Why? Because in Cuba
we had both influences.

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:41.580 position:56%
We have the classical influence, and
we also have shared the influence

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:44.360 position:56%
from Southern Spain and the Seville.

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:47.920
So this is why you see
this is a very loose grid

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:53.020 position:56%
that basically followed the contours
of the geography of the place,

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:58.190
either the river or the sea.

00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:03.560
So some streets kind of try to
be parallel to the coastline,

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:08.550
and this is why it's
explained that Havana has

00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:12.830
in a way this similarity
with Seville.

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:17.870
So you see, Seville was, you
know, by the [inaudible] River.

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:24.210
And with presence of the Moors
for eight centuries, as we know,

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:28.740
and then Havana reflects
this influence other

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:37.180 position:56%
than adopting its silhouette to this
marine condition here, this curve,

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:39.850
and that explains certain
curves in the grid,

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:44.080
which is not definitely
regular, is not regular.

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:47.570
It does not conform to
the law of the Indies.

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:51.120
And why am I saying this this way?

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:54.120
Because I get a lot
of people confused

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:57.070
with this, even scholars, okay.

00:24:57.070 --> 00:25:02.570 position:56%
So I'm clarifying this for the sake
of it, because none of these cities,

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:08.360
as you can see, they follow the
statements of the law of the Indies

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:12.040
that only came -- were
issued in 1573.

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:16.880
So by the time they came, all these
cities existed, especially Havana.

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:21.390
So, when you talk about the Indies
in America, you can refer them

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:25.030
to the foundations of other
cities, but not to the cities

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:30.060
that were founded and
developed, laid out, before 1573,

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:32.720
like these ones I'm
showing you in Cuba.

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:36.340
So, by the time you leave this
room you will be convinced of this.

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:44.380
So, this is Havana, this is the,
this vibrant capital of Cuba,

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:49.010
and everything was
different here for a reason.

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:51.830
Havana makes a difference
when you compare it

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:53.700
with the other cities
in Latin America.

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:56.600
It's not that I'm chauvinist,
it's not that I'm Cuban,

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:59.630
it's just that I'm
going to show you why.

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:03.030
Number one, Havana is
a polycentric city.

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:05.990
When you go to visit,
when you go visit the rest

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:08.890
of Latin American cities,
you find a plaza mayor.

00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:12.250
In Mexico, in Lima, and Buenos
Aires, but not in Havana,

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:14.270
there's no plaza mayor in Havana.

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:17.020
Instead, there's a system
of pedestrian squares

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:21.040
that are interconnected, and
where you are not threatened

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.830
by cars, by the way.

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:28.720
And so, everything started
in Havana with its importance

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.620 position:56%
and its importance derived from the,

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:36.460
from its strategic geographic
location, hence maps are important.

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:42.930
So, as I told you, the Spaniards
were doing a fantastic job,

00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:48.140 position:56%
if you want to be cynical, getting
all the riches from Mexico and Peru,

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:51.130
but the ships would not
go to Spain directly,

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:54.210
they would stop at
the harbor of Havana.

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:56.240
And they would be there
for around six months.

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.290
There were two trips a year.

00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:02.620
So, in the meantime, these guys
were, I mean, the crews were

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:09.170 position:56%
like the inhabitants, not permanent,
but tourists or sort of in Havana.

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:11.710
They needed accommodation,
they needed food,

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:13.690
they needed entertainment.

00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:19.880
So, they would stay in Havana and
the other world powers, let's say,

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:24.300
the British, the Dutch, the French,
who were at that time the enemies

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:26.840
of Spain, they were aware

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:31.850
of this richness being stored
in the harbor of Havana.

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:35.850
So they would come to Havana
and they would harass Havana

00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:37.470
and that happened for years.

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:43.580
In 1538, the king of Spain
commissioned Hernando de Soto,

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:49.080
who is also a name familiar to
you Americans, to come to Havana

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:52.730
as the governor and also as
the [inaudible] of Florida.

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:57.880
He was briefly in Havana,
building a fort to defend the city,

00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.320
the city from the pirates attacks.

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:04.700
And he built a wooden fort that
was destroyed by other pirates.

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:10.030 position:56%
So, as Havana became more
important, the Spanish crown decided

00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:16.610
to provide Havana with
more permanent fortresses.

00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:21.610
This is why they commissioned
Spanish engineers, Sanchez

00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:27.100
and Colona, to build this, which is
considered the most ancient bastion

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:29.150
fortress preserved in America.

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:32.300
Renaissance style, made out
of coral stone just from the,

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:34.320
from the reef, just
from the shoreline.

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.660
Those were the natural
quarries then.

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:39.640
And a perfect squaring plan,
with a hole in the middle

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.960
which is the first Cuban courtyard.

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:47.090
And then, that determined
the character of the space.

00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:50.330
This is the military
parade ground now,

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:53.510
trying to face the
attacks from the pirates.

00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:59.060
Then, in 1555, Jacques de Sores,
the French pirate, had harassed

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:04.140
and burnt out Havana, so they say,
we need a whole defenses system.

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:06.200
But the Spaniards were lazy.

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:11.770
So, the Spanish crown brought
the Antonelli family here and,

00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:16.850
I'm talking about the time
these maps were also down in,

00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:21.840
in Italy by Gastaldi and
all these guys, Forlani,

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.450
that I'm going to show you.

00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:26.920
And then they sent the
whole Antonelli family,

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:31.460 position:56%
or the Spanish crown hired them
because they had met them in Naples.

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:37.300
At the time, Spain owned Naples
and all the south part of Italy,

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:42.480 position:56%
thanks to the new pope that had been
appointed in 1492, Rodrigo Borja.

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:49.240
So, Havana was heavily fortified
and the Spaniards started the most

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:55.210
and the largest defenses system in
America, building all these forts

00:29:55.210 --> 00:30:02.490
from 1589, the La Punta
and El Morro.

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:07.700
El Morro was finished by
1639 because of being bigger.

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:10.660
And there was -- this
old map shows you a lot.

00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:13.270
It shows you how precious
Havana was,

00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:15.160
and how they tried to defend it.

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:18.590
But you, at, I will show
you that it was not enough.

00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:22.540
So, look at this chain here,
from La Punta to El Morro,

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:26.330
preventing enemy ships to come
into the, into the harbor.

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:32.310
And then look at how this old space
was evolving, having the fortress

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:34.920
and the primitive church
that was there.

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:39.830
So, this is another
map from the lat 16,

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:46.320
16th century showing how the
coast of Cuba was depicted.

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:51.560
And then, as I told you,
the fortresses themselves,

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:54.350
the fortresses alone,
there were not enough.

00:30:54.350 --> 00:31:00.110
Cuba was so wanted, Cuba was
so pressured by these pirates,

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:03.650
but not Cuba, but the riches that
were stored there and the cities

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:06.680
that were just coming out from it.

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:12.610 position:56%
So, they commissioned Cristobal de
Roda, who was a nephew of Antonelli,

00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:18.430 position:56%
to do what's considered the first
master plan of Havana, back in 1603.

00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:23.460
That is documented at the
General Archives of Seville.

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:27.670
And then, this, this is only
the remains of the walls

00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:32.370
where they were mapped,
showing old Havana.

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:34.040
Isn't this wonderful?

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:39.760
So, this is also another map from
1691, and you notice that I have

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.850
to jump in time, because I'm trying

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:45.340
to summarize five centuries
of history.

00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:48.980
So, this map shows the
polycentric condition of Havana

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:52.600
and the many squares that, that
were having either churches

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:54.680
and convents and all that.

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:59.530
Then, this is Cuba Insula,
but one of the fathers

00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:04.000
of modern cartography,
Mercator, the Dutch mapmaker.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.760
So you see Cuba was in the map.

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:17.580
And then going back to Havana,
this is an illustration also of one

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:24.870 position:56%
of the most famous Squares, the
so-called Old Plaza, or Plaza Vieja.

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:26.780
And you say, why vieja?

00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:31.340
Why old? Because there was only,
always a new one in the making.

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:36.300
So this, at that time was
named Plaza Vieja, Old Plaza,

00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:41.820
and this engraving shows the
commercial character of this plaza.

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:48.530
So, every plaza will have a
very, very precise character.

00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:50.900
There would be the military
parade ground for the army.

00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:55.510
There would be the commercial
plazas of St. Francis of Assisi

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:59.210
and the Plaza Vieja and
there would be, of course,

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:02.580
the cathedral square
for religious activity.

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:07.300
This is this is one of the things
that makes Havana different, also,

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:11.850
the porches which are
Havana's trademark.

00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:13.800
Now, this is a Nolli Plan.

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:18.590
As you know, a Nolli Plan is
related to that famous plan

00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:21.310
of Rome to show public space.

00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:26.640
This is a technique that we
architects use to test public space

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:30.130
and this is a map of
this area from Havana

00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:33.050
that tells you more
about the territory.

00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:38.190
Here you find the oldest fortress,
and the square, and the palaces

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:41.550
that were built once this
territory was transformed,

00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:43.260
which I'll show you in a minute.

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:48.820
But then, look at the
maps from these times.

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:54.270
It's a very particularly couple
maps that are very dear and famous

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:57.060
in Cuba, which are, which
were done by Coronelli.

00:33:57.060 --> 00:34:01.710
Vincenzo Mario Antonelli, sorry,

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:08.610 position:56%
Coronelli was a very famous mapmaker
who, you know, got this image

00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:11.290
of Cuba which is more accurate

00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:14.000
than the former ones
that I've shown to you.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:21.190
So, a turning point in Cuban
history was, happened in 1762,

00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:24.790
was the seize of Havana
by the British navy.

00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:29.520
They had been studying Havana
carefully for centuries.

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:31.440
They wanted Havana.

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:34.440
And they wanted Havana
for one reason.

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:38.890
They were not thinking
about the riches, only.

00:34:38.890 --> 00:34:42.200
That was the reason for
the pirates and buccaneers,

00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:44.950
but not for the British Empire.

00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:47.040
They had a different vision.

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:50.750
And the reason was
focused on United States.

00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:57.750
So, 1762 they were here, and
they were trying to do something

00:34:57.750 --> 00:35:03.360
that would give them some more
power in America, in the US.

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:07.840
So they seized Havana and they
stayed in Havana for 11 months,

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:12.040
which are still considered
the most affluent period ever

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:17.830
in economic times in Havana,
just because of the free trade.

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:24.190
Before that, the Spanish crown
had a strong monopoly on commerce,

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:29.530
so the British finished that and
Cuba benefitted from, from it.

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:30.860
So the British were there.

00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:37.130
There was a resistance,
people fought them, but still,

00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:43.000 position:56%
they took over and it's just that
they had a very particular strategy.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.150
They knew that the port
was, was very well guarded.

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:48.800
So they could not enter that way.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.150
They came the other way.

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:54.010
They came from the east,
so they, they took over.

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:59.000
And after that, they
exchanged Havana,

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.110
because they were not interested
in the rest of the country,

00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:05.320 position:56%
this is why I also insist on Havana.

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:11.380
They exchanged Havana, according
to the Paris Treaty, for Florida

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:14.490
and the rest of the southern
territories that were owned

00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:17.510
by Spain, New Orleans included.

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:24.640
Why? Because the southernmost
part that they had was Virginia.

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:29.130
And so, they needed this
[inaudible] zone to be protected

00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:32.680
and had it more geopolitical
domain of the US,

00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:36.040
so that's the historical
explanation.

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:41.430
So, after the English left, Havana
had proven to be vulnerable,

00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:43.730
so they started a second
defenses system,

00:36:43.730 --> 00:36:46.630
according to the latest
in technology.

00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:51.790
For that, they commissioned French,
Silvestre Abarca and Agustin Crame,

00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:57.440
and they provided this plan
for fortifying Havana exactly

00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:01.040
at the place where the
English had come from.

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:05.740
So this is the biggest fortress
in America named La Cabana.

00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:11.560
And it was so big, that when the
king of Spain got the invoice,

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:15.630
he went to the window
and, you know, there's,

00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:17.820
there's no way you can you
can see the sea from Madrid.

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:19.580
Madrid is just in the middle.

00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:24.470
So, after five minutes starting
outside the window, people who were

00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:27.240
in the room asked, His Majesty,
what are you staring at?

00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:31.190
And he said, well, if this has cost
so much and you say it's so big,

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:33.750
it should be seen from here.

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:37.730
So they, they built these and
they build also other fortresses

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:41.690
like the Prince Castle,
an [inaudible] fortress.

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:44.270
But the most important
transformation

00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:47.820
of Havana was not a military
one, but a civic one,

00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:51.520
which proves how important
is to be civilized

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:55.380 position:56%
and how important it is being urban.

00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:59.560
So, the former military
parade ground now was turned

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:03.720
into this first civic
center, with the construction

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:08.050
of these wonderful palaces
that are shown here.

00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:13.440
They set the paradigm for the rest
of the public buildings to be built

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:16.180
around the main squares in Havana.

00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:17.480
Look at them.

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:19.250
Look at their wonderful
architecture,

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:21.740
their monumental scale,
it's still not overwhelming,

00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:24.790
it's still in the scale
of a Caribbean island.

00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:27.070
So, Havana was turning monumental

00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:32.630
and it would be also this wonderful
marine city that everybody admired,

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:35.530
that everybody wanted to
come to, wanted to travel

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:37.920
to just like it is today.

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:42.450
It's not because it's
the forbidden fruit.

00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:47.800
So this is a map that I brought
from our national library,

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:53.620
also showing not only Havana,
but also the whole Caribbean,

00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:59.600 position:56%
showing Florida here and showing all
the relationship that was happening

00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:02.930
at this very time in
the 18th century

00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:08.780
at the time something
bigger was going to happen

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:13.120
and that was Humboldt's
trip to Cuba.

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:21.700
You know, Humboldt visited America
in the 1800s, and he visited Cuba,

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:28.330
and he was the one who clarified
that America was South, Central,

00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:33.630
and North America, and that
it was not Amerigo Vespucci

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:37.110
who discovered America,
but Columbus.

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:38.530
And this is also important

00:39:38.530 --> 00:39:44.860
because this is the first modern
atlas showing biodiversity,

00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:48.330
which at that time was not
very well understood by people.

00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:52.790
Who would care about
biodiversity in the, in 1800.

00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:58.960
Okay. But it's so important, so the
next growth of Havana would happen

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:03.100
after the first plan of
expansion of any city

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:05.510
in the whole America regions.

00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:12.810
And it happened between 1817 and
1819, by Antonio Maria de la Torre.

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:16.950
This is also important for
Cuba because this is the way

00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:23.060
that the Spanish engineer,
on purpose or not,

00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:27.710
created this wonderful realm
of the porches in Havana.

00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:31.280
You only find this in Bologna
in Italy, I mean, you can,

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:37.150
you can walk underneath here
under, under the porches for miles.

00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:42.240 position:56%
Why? Because they became commercial
arteries, so they needed protection.

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:48.010
Can you imagine living in our
weather with such a harsh sun,

00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:51.990
sunlight, and the [inaudible]
rain, you need protection.

00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:55.660
Porches are perfect for that
and that was part of Havana

00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:57.980
and they became part
of the ordinances

00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:01.010
that were imposed by 1861.

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:05.140
But before that, we had
this governor in Havana

00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:09.130
who was responsible for
a very ambitious plan.

00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:12.430
And this is particularly
significant just

00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:16.810
because his brother was a
consul here in Washington, DC.

00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:19.180
So, he knew about Washington
just because of that.

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:22.770
He was a very illustrated
person, he was a despot of course,

00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:26.720
and he was a megalomaniac who would
name every building and everything

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:29.150
that he would do after
him, just after him.

00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:33.010
So he would build these
fantastic buildings, you know,

00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:38.140
are named the Tacon theatre,
that is still seen in Havana.

00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:42.980
You go to Havana tomorrow and you
will see this building from 1840.

00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:48.010
It was finished by 1840, it's
still within a wonderful theatre,

00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:49.890
the great theatre of Havana.

00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:53.550
But if you look at this
map, it shows the expansion

00:41:53.550 --> 00:42:00.210
of the wars happening all
around this neighborhood here,

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:03.010
before the walls were demolished.

00:42:03.010 --> 00:42:05.570
At this time, they
understood that the,

00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:08.470
that the walls were
completely obsolete.

00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:12.700
And that nobody else ever
attacked Havana again,

00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:16.540 position:56%
so it means that the Spaniards spent
a lot of money building something

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:19.750
that were at some point
considered useless.

00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:25.060
So, Tacon, and Tacon's ideas
are considered the birth

00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:29.790
of monumental Havana,
but he had the goal

00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:34.080
of bringing the troops eventually
through here from this part

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:39.320
of the city to the new, the
newly constructed Prince Castle.

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:44.830 position:56%
So, he, he also had this vision, if
we ever need to displace the troops,

00:42:44.830 --> 00:42:48.510
we can do it through my
avenue, Tacon's avenue.

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:54.420
Okay, so, the, the, the very
birth of modern planning happened

00:42:54.420 --> 00:43:01.360
in Havana, with laying out of these
beautiful neighborhoods, El Vedado,

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:05.060
based on a grid, and
The Walls District.

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:11.670
They are both considered the most
important urban initiatives ever

00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:19.010 position:56%
in Havana and these are the examples
that we can still learn from today.

00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:25.260
Just briefly, the grid of El
Vedado shows a lot of wisdom,

00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:30.700 position:56%
just because you can notice that it
was rotated 45 degrees to the north.

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:35.530
Why? That's the best way to catch
the breeze and avoid the sun.

00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:39.740
And then also, the way
green was introduced,

00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:43.360
you can take a look here,
this is garden setback here,

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:48.030 position:56%
defining also the border between the
public and the private land, very,

00:43:48.030 --> 00:43:50.330
very wise concepts at that time.

00:43:50.330 --> 00:43:54.290 position:56%
Then, jumping in time, this is 1897.

00:43:54.290 --> 00:44:01.610
This is the best detailed map of
Cuba I've ever seen and it was done

00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:07.320
by the US military and
it was done in 1897.

00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:12.020
And, as you know, in 1898,
the US troops were here

00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:15.990
in Santiago de Cuba
fighting the Spaniards.

00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:22.850
And, fortunately, ending a 30 years
war that Cuba held against Spain.

00:44:22.850 --> 00:44:25.920
This is the threshold
of the 20th century,

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:30.490
so I'm bringing a summary
here of the growth of Havana.

00:44:30.490 --> 00:44:35.930
Just for you to have an idea, this
is a wonderful map showing all the,

00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:39.160
the grids, the different
grids colliding and,

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:42.190
and the territories
that had not been built.

00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:47.360
So all this was built between --
the rest was built between 1902

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:52.660
and 1958, but also, at the
beginning of the 20th century,

00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:55.790
two US engineers were
responsible for laying

00:44:55.790 --> 00:45:01.180
out this wonderful seaside
promenade, the Malecon of Havana,

00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:08.170
very much according to this
diagram here, to this old postcard.

00:45:08.170 --> 00:45:11.500
Initially, it had trees
and lighting features,

00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:16.620 position:56%
but the American pragmatism took
them away and they were never there.

00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:20.040
Also, the US influence in Havana

00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:25.540
and in Cuba was particularly
great along the 20th century

00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:32.970
and the former order brought
by the grid was replaced by,

00:45:32.970 --> 00:45:38.340
by the influence of the so-called
City Beautiful Movement [inaudible]

00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:39.640
and all that.

00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:44.820
So the suburbs were born
in Havana, in contrast,

00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:47.900
with this more order
neighborhood which is Miramar,

00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:53.940 position:56%
laid out by Cuban Leonardo Morales
and William O' Malley, US architect.

00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:57.230
So, it's a combination of both.

00:45:57.230 --> 00:46:01.900
You can see a lot of
influence from Manhattan.

00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:05.220
Remember at El Vedado we had
a grid that was a square,

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:09.030
now we have a rectangular grid
here, which is very much related

00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:10.870
to Manhattan in New York.

00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:17.660
And then, the 1920's were
particularly important for,

00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:20.710
for Cuba and for Havana.

00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:26.170 position:56%
Cuba was affluent because Cuba
benefitted from the first world war,

00:46:26.170 --> 00:46:33.710
because of the peak of the, of
sugar in the international market

00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:37.920
and there was a very
ambitious public works plan

00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:41.140
that brought together the wisdom
of Carlos Miguel de Cespedes

00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:45.780
and the entrepreneurship of
both Americans and Cubans.

00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:48.880
This is a time when the
Capitolio was being built,

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:52.040
following the example
and the inspiration

00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:54.780
of the US Capitol here
in Washington.

00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:59.810
This is a time when Forestier,
the French landscape architect,

00:46:59.810 --> 00:47:07.390
was invited to Cuba to produce this
plan of embellishment of Havana

00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:11.690
with all these, sort of Parisian
boulevards that, fortunately,

00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:15.570
were not built, otherwise Havana
would have been sort of distorted

00:47:15.570 --> 00:47:18.960
and the Colonial grid, especially
would have been affected.

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:22.220
So, we had people from all over
the world working in Havana

00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:26.830
at this time when, when the city
was acquiring this very monumental

00:47:26.830 --> 00:47:29.570
appearance with this,
the construction

00:47:29.570 --> 00:47:35.050
of the presidential palace,
hotels, and open air cafes,

00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:41.210
especially The Paseo del Prado, one
of the most important urban spaces

00:47:41.210 --> 00:47:45.290
in Havana, but one of the, also
one of the best in the world.

00:47:45.290 --> 00:47:49.340
Designed by Forestier and
Cuban architect Raul Ortero,

00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:53.380 position:56%
based on the concept, on the Spanish
concept of the elevated plaza,

00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:56.620
separating the traffic,
the pedestrians

00:47:56.620 --> 00:47:59.470
from the vehicular traffic.

00:47:59.470 --> 00:48:06.130
This is an old postcard showing the
condition of The Paseo del Prado

00:48:06.130 --> 00:48:09.270
and the tallest building
that you can imagine was done

00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:11.980
by [inaudible] Americans.

00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:15.970
And then, the Havana
electric railways.

00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:21.730
Good news for you, the Hershey
train in Havana is still working.

00:48:21.730 --> 00:48:25.380
Yes, Hershey's chocolate,
American Havana.

00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:29.130
This tells you a lot about the
relationship of both countries.

00:48:29.130 --> 00:48:34.540
We had a wonderful tram system
that is unfortunately gone.

00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:36.000
It was killed by the cars.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.900
But our inspiration is to, at some
point in the future, take it back.

00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:46.760
So, this is also a tourist
map of Havana, 1951,

00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:50.090
showing how all the free areas

00:48:50.090 --> 00:48:54.000
that I showed you before,
now they are built.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.600
They were urbanized, so Havana
was booming, also benefitting

00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:00.770
from the second world war.

00:49:00.770 --> 00:49:03.440 position:56%
So there was a boom in construction,
there was a boom in architecture,

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:07.200
there was a boom in design, and
yes, the mobsters were there too,

00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:10.980
so there was a lot of
influx in, in Havana.

00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:14.330
There was a lot of
money poured in Havana.

00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:19.200
And then, 1956, the National Board

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:22.430
of Planning commissioned
Town Planning Associates

00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:29.020
for doing, pilot plan of Havana.

00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:30.710
Town Planning Associates was led

00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:35.890
by Catalonian architect Josep Lluis
Serp, then the dean at Harvard.

00:49:35.890 --> 00:49:42.520
Had this been built, this
financial district in Old Havana,

00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:47.990
Havana would have never been listed
as a UNESCO World Heritage site.

00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:50.270
So fortunately, it was not built.

00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:53.590
And it was not only the
financial district here,

00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:56.940
it was also this artificial
island for casinos

00:49:56.940 --> 00:50:00.200
and hotels, across [inaudible].

00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:02.450
Yes, it would have been Las
Vegas, instead of Havana.

00:50:02.450 --> 00:50:04.680
Fortunately, it never happened.

00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:10.820 position:56%
So, this is a summary of the second
half of the 20th century as several,

00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:13.940
now, plans for the city of Havana.

00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:18.740
Not a lot to say about them
except for there were a couple

00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:22.420
of new campuses built in Havana,
one for the schools of art,

00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:24.490
one for the technological careers,

00:50:24.490 --> 00:50:29.590
and then also another one showing
how Havana survived the collapse

00:50:29.590 --> 00:50:32.690
of the Soviet bloc in 1989.

00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:35.430
So, we're moving to the
future because we do believe

00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:37.850
that Havana is ready for a change.

00:50:37.850 --> 00:50:42.150 position:56%
But not any change, but a sensitive
one based on sustainable principles.

00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:48.050
And this is what led me to,
in a way, conceive of a plan

00:50:48.050 --> 00:50:52.410
for the future of Havana while I
was [inaudible] at Harvard 2001,

00:50:52.410 --> 00:50:57.750
2002 that I kept on
developing along the next years.

00:50:57.750 --> 00:51:02.570
This is a plan that
can remap Havana,

00:51:02.570 --> 00:51:08.320
meaning that can bring Havana
to the future, which I will go

00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:11.790
through briefly because
you must be hungry.

00:51:11.790 --> 00:51:15.700
So, this is the main
concepts and strategies

00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:17.660
that the plan is based upon.

00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:19.670
It's a very comprehensive plan.

00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:21.800
It's an independent plan.

00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:27.330 position:56%
This plan follows the city needs
and not the government's dictations.

00:51:27.330 --> 00:51:29.810
So, it was not commissioned
by the government.

00:51:29.810 --> 00:51:31.850
Nobody paid a penny for it.

00:51:31.850 --> 00:51:35.790
It's a work of love that I
did for the city of Havana.

00:51:35.790 --> 00:51:40.360
So, these are the concepts
that the plan is based upon.

00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:44.880 position:56%
The reinforcement of the polycentric
city that you heard me speaking of,

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:49.010 position:56%
the redevelopment of the waterfront,
but above all, for the first time,

00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:54.900
Havana enjoys a comprehensive
plan and not only a partial plan

00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:59.010
or one done by military,
or by government.

00:51:59.010 --> 00:52:03.150
It's been done by a team
of individuals that I led,

00:52:03.150 --> 00:52:09.500
I was honored to lead this group,
and it's exactly for the future.

00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:14.360
Some other lectures that I do,
I start saying that I'm here

00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:15.660
to speak about the future.

00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:20.450
But here today, I've been here
to speak about the past and also

00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:22.080
about the present and the future.

00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:25.060
And this is how the
future may look for Havana,

00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:27.250
especially at the harbor area,

00:52:27.250 --> 00:52:30.490
which was always the
economic engine for the city.

00:52:30.490 --> 00:52:34.620
For the first time in history, the
city has a plan for this harbor

00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:39.780
for it to become a contemporary
commercial sport harbor instead

00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:41.770
of an industrial harbor.

00:52:41.770 --> 00:52:46.110
So we want to leave the derelict
harbor behind and move on.

00:52:46.110 --> 00:52:50.120
So you see how much
opportunities are here

00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:53.140
for development, for
new development.

00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:57.670
But not, you know, not
high-rises but the scale of Havana.

00:52:57.670 --> 00:53:02.300
Let me clarify that this is an
existing high-rise from 1959.

00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:06.290
So our new proposals are
based on the scale of the city

00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:10.510
and we do believe that we don't
need to go to build high-rises

00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:15.020 position:56%
to achieve the right density and,
most important, the right intensity.

00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:18.860
Urban intensity is achieved
not through high rises

00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:22.300
but sensitive building
that establish a dialogue

00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:25.410
with the people and
with the streets.

00:53:25.410 --> 00:53:32.040
So, this is also another new map,
another new plan for the very core

00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:37.580 position:56%
of Havana, the most dilapidated part
in fact, which is central Havana,

00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:40.270
where there's very
little public space.

00:53:40.270 --> 00:53:43.740
And this is why you can
appreciate here the difference

00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:49.150
between the existing
condition and our proposal.

00:53:49.150 --> 00:53:54.710
This is also another sector
of Havana, we have a plan

00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:58.260
for the whole city and for
the, for all the neighborhoods

00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:00.690
for the first time in history.

00:54:00.690 --> 00:54:04.740
We, we've gone beyond that,
because we do believe in democracy.

00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:07.620
And for the first time in
history, there's a plan,

00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:10.910
this plan that has been
consulted with the people,

00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:14.860
and not only the people of Havana,
but people who've come to Havana

00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:18.620
from all over the world to share
their ideas and their concepts,

00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:23.620
and because they do believe in
the value of the master plan

00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:25.360
for the future of Havana.

00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:28.970
I'm proud to say that are
several of them in this room,

00:54:28.970 --> 00:54:31.530
for which I'm very
honored and happy.

00:54:31.530 --> 00:54:36.920
And I also hope that most of
you, all of you, visit Havana

00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:38.590
and be part of this effort.

00:54:38.590 --> 00:54:42.840 position:56%
We've tested the ideas of the master
plan through public charrettes,

00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:46.720
public workshops, week-long
charrettes,

00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:49.610
where we submit these
ideas to the people.

00:54:49.610 --> 00:54:54.020 position:56%
We consult with them, people
participate and they are part of it.

00:54:54.020 --> 00:55:00.550
I can't remember, I'm saying
that I am totally sure

00:55:00.550 --> 00:55:05.080
that this had never
been done in Cuba.

00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:09.600
So, there's a combination
here of things that I learned

00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:13.870
across the years through my
trips, especially to Scandinavia,

00:55:13.870 --> 00:55:17.250
because we do believe that
cities are for the people.

00:55:17.250 --> 00:55:21.150
Cities are the true repositories
of history, but this is the,

00:55:21.150 --> 00:55:27.880
probably the highest achievement of
our civilization, living in cities.

00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:32.130
And so, this is a map of Cuba.

00:55:32.130 --> 00:55:35.970
As you know, the magic has gone.

00:55:35.970 --> 00:55:39.560
It has a lot of information,
but there's no beauty.

00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:45.110 position:56%
There's no, this ancient beauty that
we found in ancient maps is gone.

00:55:45.110 --> 00:55:49.950
So I know that this
cannot be taken back just

00:55:49.950 --> 00:55:52.300
because of the digital age.

00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:56.600 position:56%
And I know that now instead of using
one of these maps that I still use,

00:55:56.600 --> 00:56:01.360 position:56%
whenever I come to a city I ask for
the map of the hotel I'm staying at,

00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:04.200
now we use, you know, in our
phones, either in our phones

00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:05.900
or our computer, we
use digital maps.

00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:09.490
We use Google Earth and all
that, which is very useful.

00:56:09.490 --> 00:56:13.150
I also use it for when I drive.

00:56:13.150 --> 00:56:16.700
But, the magic is gone, we
have to acknowledge that.

00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:19.790
And the art of the
ancient maps is gone.

00:56:19.790 --> 00:56:25.620
I want to say something to
finish the lecture that I wrote

00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:30.510
for the book I'm currently
working on and it goes like,

00:56:30.510 --> 00:56:33.790
There's cartography
of the world for sure,

00:56:33.790 --> 00:56:36.240
but will there ever
be a whole cartography

00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:39.140
of our ever-expanding universe?

00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:41.840
There's cartography of place
and there's cartography of time.

00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:46.110
Cartography of the human being
and cartography of the cosmos.

00:56:46.110 --> 00:56:49.690
When the mapping of time and
place converge, then the awareness

00:56:49.690 --> 00:56:54.170 position:56%
of arriving at a sense of
transcendental understanding of life

00:56:54.170 --> 00:56:56.760
and the world is achieved.

00:56:56.760 --> 00:57:01.000
A balance between the known and
the unknown, yet ultimately,

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:04.460
a self-contemplation
of mankind's soul.

00:57:04.460 --> 00:57:08.510
Ultimately, when all
cartographies merge into one,

00:57:08.510 --> 00:57:11.630
a great deal of the mystery
of life will be revealed.

00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:15.500
A single point and yet an all
encompassing spell stemming

00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:18.120
from the wonder of human
life on planet Earth.

00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:19.920
Thank you very much.

00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:28.040
[ Applause ]

00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:29.340
I would welcome any questions.

00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:30.640
Please Mark.

00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:31.940
&gt;&gt; Could you go back to your
first slide for a minute?

00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:33.240
&gt;&gt; Julio Cesar Perez
Hernandez: First slide?

00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:34.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the very first one.

00:57:34.540 --> 00:57:35.840
With the map of the world.

00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:37.140
&gt;&gt; Julio Cesar Perez
Hernandez: Oh, the Waldseemuller.

00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:38.440
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:39.740
&gt;&gt; Julio Cesar Perez Hernandez:
You want the Waldseemuller?

00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:43.560
Waldseemuller was, by the
way, this sort of crazy monk,

00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:48.370
living in France, and putting
together a group of scholars,

00:57:48.370 --> 00:57:53.940
and trying to figure out
what do we publish next?

00:57:53.940 --> 00:57:57.200
And this is how Vespucci's letters

00:57:57.200 --> 00:57:59.920
and statements were
published for the first time.

00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:06.240
And this is how America, the
name, was branded, in a way.

00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:07.540
Any questions, please?

00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:08.840
Naomi please.

00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:10.900
&gt;&gt; How will the plan that you

00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:15.460
and your other group have
developed be advanced in Cuba?

00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:17.320
&gt;&gt; Julio Cesar Perez Hernandez:
Well, good news, Naomi.

00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:22.490
When I was back in Cuba recently,
I saw that some of the ideas

00:58:22.490 --> 00:58:26.530
of the master plan are
already being implemented.

00:58:26.530 --> 00:58:29.410
So, it means that it
seems to be happening

00:58:29.410 --> 00:58:32.220 position:56%
in our lifetime, which is good news.

00:58:32.220 --> 00:58:36.340
Not many people are
so lucky and then,

00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:38.390
you can ask me why, how is that?

00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:42.210
Well, as I said, we do
a charrette every year.

00:58:42.210 --> 00:58:46.090
And we deliver a publication
of our charrette to the office

00:58:46.090 --> 00:58:47.850
of the historian of the city.

00:58:47.850 --> 00:58:51.640
And then some people who know these
are my ideas, they write an email

00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:53.770
to me and they say, oh, I saw this

00:58:53.770 --> 00:58:55.770
and I know they didn't
give you any credit.

00:58:55.770 --> 00:58:59.020
And I say, you know
what, I don't care,

00:58:59.020 --> 00:59:02.170
because while Havana is benefitting
from this, I wouldn't care

00:59:02.170 --> 00:59:03.630
that they give me credit.

00:59:03.630 --> 00:59:06.450
It's not about ego,
it's about the city.

00:59:06.450 --> 00:59:08.570
Please, this other lady over there.

00:59:08.570 --> 00:59:10.400
Please.

00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:12.820
&gt;&gt; You talked about urban density

00:59:12.820 --> 00:59:16.880
and that it's not composed
of high-rises.

00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:19.210
So we hear what it's
not composed of.

00:59:19.210 --> 00:59:23.380
Would you talk a little bit more
about what it is composed of?

00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:25.210
&gt;&gt; Julio Cesar Perez Hernandez:
That's another lecture, my dear.

00:59:25.210 --> 00:59:32.290
But anyway, I, I am not
saying I can't reply to that.

00:59:32.290 --> 00:59:35.730
There is an expanded mistake

00:59:35.730 --> 00:59:40.590
that urban density can only be
achieved by building high-rises.

00:59:40.590 --> 00:59:44.610
I'm fortunate to be
here in Washington, DC,

00:59:44.610 --> 00:59:48.380
a city that is a good
example of that.

00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:53.260
I can also mention Madrid,
London, Rome, Paris, you know,

00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:57.990
you've got seven, nine story, and
the urban density is incredible.

00:59:57.990 --> 01:00:00.180
But when you build
high-rises, the problem is

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:05.720
that you start losing the
quality of the adjacent spaces.

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:10.930
And then, yeah, you live on the
29th floor and there are two cities

01:00:10.930 --> 01:00:15.920 position:56%
in America, in the US sorry, that
are probably the exception for that.

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:19.420
I would say Chicago and
New York, cities I love.

01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:22.640
Their urban condition is different
and their synergy is different,

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:26.170
their energy is different,
and the idiosyncracies

01:00:26.170 --> 01:00:28.190
of both cities are different.

01:00:28.190 --> 01:00:30.680
And they are different
and unique, which,

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:34.230
which means that you
should not imitate them,

01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:37.490 position:56%
because if you imitate them, then
you've got Hong Kong and you've got,

01:00:37.490 --> 01:00:40.210
you know, these Chinese
crazy cities.

01:00:40.210 --> 01:00:41.590
You know, yeah, they're crazy

01:00:41.590 --> 01:00:43.700
and they are polluting
the world, we know.

01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:47.280
And we should not allow
that to happen.

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:50.490
So, in a good way you have to
blame the high-rises for this.

01:00:50.490 --> 01:00:54.760
You have to blame the skyscrapers,
which are not efficient buildings

01:00:54.760 --> 01:01:00.560
as we know, which are not a good
example of design in most cases.

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:02.550
Take a look at the
beauty of Washington, DC.

01:01:02.550 --> 01:01:05.620
Take a look at the beauty of
the neoclassical buildings.

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:08.320
Take a look at the other buildings
that have been built in Washington,

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:11.190
DC, especially in the mall area.

01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:13.060
They are fantastic.

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:14.960
You know, this is something
we admire.

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:17.300
Why is Washington so special?

01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:19.420
Why is it so appealing?

01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:23.530
Because of it's European
character, L'Enfant.

01:01:23.530 --> 01:01:24.830
Let's face it.

01:01:24.830 --> 01:01:28.930
The American cities are not
so nice, the rest of them,

01:01:28.930 --> 01:01:32.940 position:56%
I love Boston, I love San Francisco.

01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:34.820
I don't like Miami.

01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:39.590
I don't like it, because
it's anti-urban.

01:01:39.590 --> 01:01:43.390
Miami is the, is the
kingdom of suburbs.

01:01:43.390 --> 01:01:46.020
You cannot walk, you cannot
rub shoulders, you cannot talk

01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:52.450
to people, and it's a complete,
completely disconnected city.

01:01:52.450 --> 01:01:54.900 position:56%
[Inaudible Question] Well, and then,

01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:58.460
well you've got the
wonderful northeast cities

01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:00.950
which Washington is
the southernmost part.

01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:03.410
Recently, I had a conversation
with my oldest son,

01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:08.410
who is in delivering business,
he's a software developer,

01:02:08.410 --> 01:02:10.930
but he loves architecture
for a reason.

01:02:10.930 --> 01:02:15.980
And he said, you know what, I
think that the best city in the US,

01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:17.780
in the north, we talk
about the Northeast,

01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:22.500 position:56%
we talk about the Northwest, we talk
about the Midwest, which is lovely,

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:25.610
because it has not been
spoiled by skyscrapers,

01:02:25.610 --> 01:02:30.480
and we talked about Washington
and he was reflecting about that

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:34.290
and he said, you know father,
I think that Washington is the,

01:02:34.290 --> 01:02:38.460
the most beautiful
southern city in the US.

01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:42.570
And I said, well, but what
about Charleston and Savannah?

01:02:42.570 --> 01:02:44.820
And he said, stop there.

01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:48.390
Let's leave it for now
Washington, DC, okay.

01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:49.710
So, please.

01:02:49.710 --> 01:02:51.790
&gt;&gt; Did you allow for
pedestrian areas?

01:02:51.790 --> 01:02:55.520
You didn't point them
out, but I would assume

01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:58.040
that in Europe they're
very prominent.

01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:59.340
&gt;&gt; Julio Cesar Perez Hernandez:
You're right, you're right.

01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:00.660
We inherited that tradition.

01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:03.310
Havana, for example.

01:03:03.310 --> 01:03:06.770
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] that Cuba
will inherit from the rest

01:03:06.770 --> 01:03:11.190
of the Caribbean is
the cruise ships.

01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:14.130
&gt;&gt; Julio Cesar Perez Hernandez: My
darling, I have bad news for you.

01:03:14.130 --> 01:03:15.930
I have bad news for you.

01:03:15.930 --> 01:03:20.050
There are cruise ships in
Havana weekly, twice a week.

01:03:20.050 --> 01:03:27.340
And they are these humongous
city-like, like block size ships,

01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:29.470 position:56%
not the scale of the port of Havana.

01:03:29.470 --> 01:03:32.470
So we advocate for sailing ships.

01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:38.470
I don't know if you are familiar
with [inaudible] ship, are you?

01:03:38.470 --> 01:03:43.020
Good. Well, that's the size of
vessels we would welcome in Havana,

01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:47.220
if I were the mayor, which
is not going to happen.

01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:49.120
I don't want that.

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:51.470
So any other question please?

01:03:51.470 --> 01:03:54.480
No more questions?

01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:56.690
&gt;&gt; Actually, I do have one.

01:03:56.690 --> 01:03:57.990
&gt;&gt; Okay.

01:03:57.990 --> 01:04:02.250
&gt;&gt; How would you say currently
the Cuban architecture

01:04:02.250 --> 01:04:07.220
and the construction of Havana
influenced the later construction

01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:08.520
of the cities in South America?

01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:13.120
If you can find any
relationship at all.

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:16.010
&gt;&gt; Julio Cesar Perez Hernandez:
There is certainly a relationship,

01:04:16.010 --> 01:04:20.130
but still there are
many differences,

01:04:20.130 --> 01:04:23.480
in the same way there are
difference between the Cuban cities

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:25.830
and their European precedents.

01:04:25.830 --> 01:04:31.270
I mean, if you go to Seville, if
you go to Cadiz, you'll find a lot

01:04:31.270 --> 01:04:34.750
of similarities between
those cities and Havana.

01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:39.890
You immediately recognize, if
you go there you say, well,

01:04:39.890 --> 01:04:42.370
this is where I'm coming from.

01:04:42.370 --> 01:04:47.450
This is the very origins, but, but
still there are so many difference

01:04:47.450 --> 01:04:49.290
and there's a reason for that.

01:04:49.290 --> 01:04:55.600
You know, number one, the
labor that was taken to Havana,

01:04:55.600 --> 01:05:01.560
they had this DNA, so
this is what they knew.

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:03.420
They, they were very pragmatic.

01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:08.690
They had only their experience to
build towns and cities in Cuba.

01:05:08.690 --> 01:05:10.650
And they had to use
different materials.

01:05:10.650 --> 01:05:12.980
They had to use local materials.

01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:17.640
So, the carving you
find in cities in Spain

01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:21.660 position:56%
or certain sophistication is not the
one that you will find in Havana.

01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:24.230
When it comes to older
Latin American cities,

01:05:24.230 --> 01:05:28.980
let's say Cartegena Indies,
well, you find their buildings,

01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:31.940
courtyard buildings for
example, that could be one

01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:34.260
of the main similarities.

01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:37.310
At the urban level,
you'll find there's a grid.

01:05:37.310 --> 01:05:45.430
And the grids of those Latin
American cities are more perfected

01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:49.650
than the ones you find here,
except for the grid of the city

01:05:49.650 --> 01:05:52.990
of Cienfuegos in Cuba, which
is a neoclassical city,

01:05:52.990 --> 01:05:56.040
a 19th century, founded in 1819.

01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:59.000
It's a perfect grid, like
the ones you find in any

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.330
of the Latin American countries.

01:06:01.330 --> 01:06:05.980
Please. [Inaudible Question]
A little bit louder, please?

01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:16.340
&gt;&gt; So what can you say about the
challenges that Havana is going

01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:19.430
to face going forward with,
say as it starts experiencing.

01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:21.960
&gt;&gt; Julio Cesar Perez Hernandez: The
main challenge is the stubbornness

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:23.440
of the, of the governing
bureaucracy.

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:24.740
Yeah, I speak my mind.

01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:30.030
People who are in this
room, they know me.

01:06:30.030 --> 01:06:31.330
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] for tourists.

01:06:31.330 --> 01:06:32.630
&gt;&gt; Julio Cesar Perez
Hernandez: Yeah, infrastructure,

01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:35.040
upgrading infrastructure is
one of the concepts in my plan.

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:39.790
There was a time when
Havana was a world example

01:06:39.790 --> 01:06:44.170
of modern infrastructure,
very much thanks to the US.

01:06:44.170 --> 01:06:51.770 position:56%
The US built in Cuba the most
advanced sewage system in the world.

01:06:51.770 --> 01:06:54.530
They, they made an
experiment and it worked.

01:06:54.530 --> 01:06:57.680
And that is still the one that
Havana enjoys, but you know,

01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:59.570
it's a century old, my dear,

01:06:59.570 --> 01:07:03.040
so you need to renew it,
same for the streets.

01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:08.370
You know, one of the things that
the US intervention government did

01:07:08.370 --> 01:07:14.540
in between 1899 and
1902 was the repavement

01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:16.720
of the, of the stress of Havana.

01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:20.020
They used a very, then,
advanced system of macadam.

01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:22.330
Are you familiar with the system?

01:07:22.330 --> 01:07:24.050
It's very, very good.

01:07:24.050 --> 01:07:25.630
So, you'll find some
streets in Havana

01:07:25.630 --> 01:07:27.470
that still paved with
the macadam system.

01:07:27.470 --> 01:07:30.060
And then there were
other improvements that,

01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:35.670
that were introduced by the
US government in all fields.

01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:40.200
For example, in education
they brought teachers

01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:42.700
to study at Harvard and Cornell.

01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:48.830
And they introduced a lot
of urban improvements.

01:07:48.830 --> 01:07:50.750 position:56%
Yeah, probably last question, right?

01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:57.590
&gt;&gt; You mentioned the US government
and you had a slide up there where,

01:07:57.590 --> 01:08:08.970
I guess it was an army map,
of the late 19th century

01:08:08.970 --> 01:08:11.270
where it was covered up there.

01:08:11.270 --> 01:08:13.490
What, could you just
describe what was underneath?

01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:14.790
&gt;&gt; Julio Cesar Perez Hernandez:

01:08:14.790 --> 01:08:16.090
[Laughter] Underneath
was a map of Cuba.

01:08:16.090 --> 01:08:20.670
Underneath the concept,
you can guess.

01:08:20.670 --> 01:08:27.870
Remember that this was 1897 and
the US was there in the next year.

01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:30.270
Teddy Roosevelt Riders.

01:08:30.270 --> 01:08:31.570
Okay.

01:08:31.570 --> 01:08:33.000
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.760
&gt;&gt; Julio Cesar Perez
Hernandez: Thank you.

01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:37.220
[ Applause ]

01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:40.860

of the Library of Congress.
