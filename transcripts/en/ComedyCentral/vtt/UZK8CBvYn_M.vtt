00:00:10.976 --> 00:00:13.146 align:start position:0%
  Have we ever had such a
  healing tradition as this?

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.048 size:88% position:44%
  - So healthy and so smart!

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:16.149

00:00:17.783 --> 00:00:19.752
 Massaged kale!

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:20.887 size:88% position:44%
 We got some bluebs,

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.822
otherwise known as blueberries.

00:00:22.855 --> 00:00:24.057 size:88% position:44%

  And I'm going to tell you

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:35.234

00:00:35.267 --> 00:00:36.969 size:88% position:44%
  (blender whirring)

00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:38.638
My time matters,

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:40.273 size:84% position:42%
  eye shadow is very heavy.

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:41.541 size:88% position:44%
  (blender whirring)

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:43.476 align:start size:88% position:13%

  - It looks yummy.

00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:47.046
 I should get started on mine.

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:48.481 size:88% position:44%
 Starting with yams,

00:00:48.514 --> 00:00:49.682 size:88% position:44%
 gonna do some blackberries.

00:00:49.715 --> 00:00:51.717 align:start size:88% position:13%
 That makes the
 smoothie expensive.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:52.552 size:88% position:44%
 Bee pollen.

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:53.519

00:00:53.552 --> 00:00:55.288 size:84% position:42%
  - So that I live forever.

00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:56.456
 - Where ya goin',
 the farmer's market?

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.758
 - Blend it up with some ice.

00:00:58.791 --> 00:00:59.592 size:84% position:42%
  - Witchy.

00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:01.527

  - What's mah-cah?

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:09.235

(blender whirs)

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:12.205 align:start size:88% position:13%

(blender whirs)

00:01:16.308 --> 00:01:18.578 size:88% position:44%
 But you don't seem to hear.

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:19.512
That's a relief.

00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:20.880
 - You know, looking at mine,

00:01:20.913 --> 00:01:22.482 size:84% position:42%
  it looks a little chunky.

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:23.316
- You know what,

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:24.317
mines not chunky enough.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.886
- I think I need
to add some ice.

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:27.954 align:start size:88% position:13%
  (girls yelling
  over blender whir)

00:01:27.987 --> 00:01:29.155
You're not showering every day.

  (girls yelling
  over blender whir)

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:34.360
You feel uncomfortable.

00:01:34.393 --> 00:01:35.194

00:01:35.227 --> 00:01:36.028

 (upbeat music)

00:01:46.505 --> 00:01:48.307 size:88% position:44%

 this twice a year.
