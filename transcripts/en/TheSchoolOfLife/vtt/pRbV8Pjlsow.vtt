00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.500
Irrespective of whether you consider Jesus a popular itinerant preacher or the Son of God,

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.700
there’s a very odd thing about his views on love.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.400
He not only spoke a great deal about love:

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.900
he went on to advocate that we should love some highly surprising people.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:24.300
At one point, – described in chapter 7 of Luke’s Gospel – Jesus goes to a dinner party and a local prostitute turns up

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.420
much to the disgust of the hosts.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.240
But Jesus is friendly and sweet and defends her against everyone else’s criticism.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.800
In a way that shocks the other guests, he insists that, at heart, she is a very good person.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.480
There’s another story (in Matthew, chapter 8) where Jesus is approached by a man with leprosy.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.480
He’s in a disgusting state.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.620
But Jesus isn’t shocked, reaches out his hand and touches the man.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:57.160
Despite the horrendous appearance, here is someone (in Jesus’s eyes) entirely deserving of closeness and kindness.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.800
In a similar vein, at other times, Jesus conspicuously argues that tax collectors, thieves and adulterers

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.700
are never to be thought of as outside the circle of love.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.200
Many centuries after his death,

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.780
the foremost medieval thinker Thomas Aquinas defined what Jesus was getting at in this way of talking about love:

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.820
He wrote "the person who truly understands love could love anyone."

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.840
In other words: true love isn’t specific in its target;

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.400
it doesn’t fixate on particular qualities,

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.900
it's open to all of humanity,

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.300
even (and in a way especially) its less appealing examples.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.020
Today, this can sound like a deeply strange notion of what love is,

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.580
for our background ideas about love tend to be closely tied to a dramatic experience:

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.840
that of falling in love,

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:55.940
that is, finding one, very specific person immensely attractive, exciting and free of any failings or drawbacks.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.100
Love is, we feel, a response to an overt perfection of another person.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:10.180
Yet – via some admittedly extreme examples – a very important aspect of love is being pushed to the fore in Jesus’ vision.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:18.240
And we don’t have to be Christian (that is, we don’t have to believe there’s an afterlife or that Jesus was born to a virgin) to benefit from it.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:25.000
At the heart of this kind of love is an effort to see beyond the outwardly unappealing surface of another human

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.800
in search of the tender, interesting, scared and vulnerable person inside.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.600
What we know as the ‘work’ of love

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:40.060
is the emotional, imaginative labour that’s required to peer behind an off-putting facade.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.400
Our minds tend fiercely to resist such a move.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.460
They follow well worn grooves that feel familiar and justified.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.600
For instance, if someone hurt us we naturally see them as horrible.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.440
The thought they might themselves be hurting inside feels weird.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:04.400
If a person looks odd, we find it extremely difficult to recognise there might well be many touching things about them deep down.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.000
If unpleasant events happen in someone’s life

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.120
– if they keep losing their job or acquire a habit of drinking too much or even develop cancer –

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.860
we’re somehow tempted to hold them responsible for their misfortunes.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:22.400
It takes a deliberate, taxing effort of the mind to move ourselves off these deeply established responses.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:29.500
To do so might mean taking an unappealing-looking person and trying to imagine them as a young a child,

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.060
unselfconsciously playing on their bedroom floor.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.460
We might try to picture their mother, not long after their birth,

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.940
holding them in her arms, overcome by passionate love for this new little life.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.160
Or perhaps, drunk and passed out, ignoring their desperate cries.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.800
We might see a furious person in a restaurant

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.040
violently complaining that the tomato sauce is on the wrong place on their plate

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:00.800
but rather than condemn and feel superior, we might try to construct a story of how this individual had come to be so impossible,

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.940
and how powerless things feel in a world where something

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.300
(and obviously not what they're ostensibly complaining about)

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.400
has frustrated them to the core.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.520
The more energy we expend in thinking like this, the more we stand to discover a very surprising truth:

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.440
that we could potentially see the loveable sides of pretty much anyone.

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.200
That doesn’t mean we should give up all criteria when searching for a partner.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.920
It’s a way of saying that the nicest person will eventually require us to look at them with imagination

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.900
as we try to negotiate around some of their gravely dispiriting sides.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.100
And, of course, the traffic won’t ever be all just one way.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.060
We too are deeply challenging to be around

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.500
and therefore stand in need of a constantly imaginative,

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:55.700
tender gaze to rescue us from being dismissed as merely another everyday monster – or leper.
