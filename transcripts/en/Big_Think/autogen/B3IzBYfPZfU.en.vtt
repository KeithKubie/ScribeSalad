alright sometimes we don't have control

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:47.729
alright sometimes we don't have control
 

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:51.319
alright sometimes we don't have control
over that dial and the question is why

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329
over that dial and the question is why
 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.300
over that dial and the question is why
is the Higgs the dial on this for the

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310
is the Higgs the dial on this for the
 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.770
is the Higgs the dial on this for the
heck that dials the mass of the Higgs

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780

for us to have our mass so that's called
a fine tuning problem so even if we find

a fine tuning problem so even if we find
 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:05.809

that back to if we find the Higgs that
 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.980
that back to if we find the Higgs that
means

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990
means
 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.180

we'll have to deal with this fine tuning

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190
we'll have to deal with this fine tuning

Higgs then that's good for me because

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:48.199
Higgs then that's good for me because
 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:49.900

that means we have work to do and it

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910
that means we have work to do and it
 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.749
that means we have work to do and it
means that the standard model was a big

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:52.759
means that the standard model was a big
 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:55.180
means that the standard model was a big
part of it was just wrong and we and

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190
part of it was just wrong and we and
 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.700
part of it was just wrong and we and
also for me it means that the way we

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710
also for me it means that the way we
 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.249
also for me it means that the way we
think about mass when it comes to

experiment well the energy scales are

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500
experiment well the energy scales are
 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.339
experiment well the energy scales are
you know we're talking about you know

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:42.349
you know we're talking about you know
 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:45.820
you know we're talking about you know
I'm the order of a thousand Giga

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830
I'm the order of a thousand Giga
 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.219
I'm the order of a thousand Giga
electron volts remember about 10

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:48.229
electron volts remember about 10
 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:51.010
electron volts remember about 10
electron volts is what it takes a you

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020
electron volts is what it takes a you
 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.170
electron volts is what it takes a you
know if you if you liberate an electron

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180
know if you if you liberate an electron
 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:59.010
know if you if you liberate an electron
right from an atom from hydrogen um so

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020
right from an atom from hydrogen um so
 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.040
right from an atom from hydrogen um so
now a Giga electron volt right is on the

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050
now a Giga electron volt right is on the
 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.570
now a Giga electron volt right is on the
order of a billion electron volt so

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580
order of a billion electron volt so
 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.070
order of a billion electron volt so
we're talking about a thousand billion

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080
we're talking about a thousand billion
 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.930
we're talking about a thousand billion
electron volts that's the energy that

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.940
electron volts that's the energy that
 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.680
electron volts that's the energy that
will be taken matter too so we're going

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:11.690
will be taken matter too so we're going
 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.930
will be taken matter too so we're going
to access this amount of matter I mean

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940
to access this amount of matter I mean
 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.899
to access this amount of matter I mean
the amount of energy and we have to be

00:06:16.899 --> 00:06:16.909
the amount of energy and we have to be
 

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:18.129
the amount of energy and we have to be
able to contain that amount of energy

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:18.139
able to contain that amount of energy
 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:21.189
able to contain that amount of energy
because it influences magnetic fields

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:21.199
because it influences magnetic fields
 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:24.760
because it influences magnetic fields
and all sorts of things right if you're

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770
and all sorts of things right if you're
 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.740
and all sorts of things right if you're
coned bill will be really really high if

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750
coned bill will be really really high if
 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.689
coned bill will be really really high if
you're trying to you know use that

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:28.699
you're trying to you know use that
 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:34.029
you're trying to you know use that
amount of energy so the some theorists

00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:34.039
amount of energy so the some theorists
 

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:35.920
amount of energy so the some theorists
have tried to say well we can create

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:35.930
have tried to say well we can create
 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.469
have tried to say well we can create
black holes for example because the

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:38.479
black holes for example because the
 

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:40.240
black holes for example because the
energy scales you can actually you know

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:40.250
energy scales you can actually you know
 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:40.629
energy scales you can actually you know
when you

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639
when you
 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:42.700
when you
fine mint orders for example you can

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:42.710
fine mint orders for example you can
 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.800
fine mint orders for example you can
create if you give me enough energy I

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:44.810
create if you give me enough energy I
 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:47.409
create if you give me enough energy I
can convert that from empty space into

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:47.419
can convert that from empty space into
 

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:49.899
can convert that from empty space into
matter or matter could annihilate into

00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:49.909
matter or matter could annihilate into
 

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:53.800
matter or matter could annihilate into
emmajin so some people think well I

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:53.810
emmajin so some people think well I
 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:56.429
emmajin so some people think well I
therefore I should be able to create a

00:06:56.429 --> 00:06:56.439
therefore I should be able to create a
 

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:58.689
therefore I should be able to create a
quantum black holes i can create black

00:06:58.689 --> 00:06:58.699
quantum black holes i can create black
 

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:03.670
quantum black holes i can create black
holes in this lab and then of course you

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:03.680
holes in this lab and then of course you
 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.679
holes in this lab and then of course you
can then argue well if i create a black

00:07:05.679 --> 00:07:05.689
can then argue well if i create a black
 

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:09.189
can then argue well if i create a black
hole right here on earth won't i suck

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:09.199
hole right here on earth won't i suck
 

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:11.529
hole right here on earth won't i suck
everything into the black hole right so

00:07:11.529 --> 00:07:11.539
everything into the black hole right so
 

00:07:11.539 --> 00:07:15.010
everything into the black hole right so
and then if you go on as a furious is

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:15.020
and then if you go on as a furious is
 

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.920
and then if you go on as a furious is
that going to be catastrophic i mean i

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:17.930
that going to be catastrophic i mean i
 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.219
that going to be catastrophic i mean i
don't know i can't predict that so

00:07:21.219 --> 00:07:21.229
don't know i can't predict that so
 

00:07:21.229 --> 00:07:22.649
don't know i can't predict that so
that's kind of where things go but

00:07:22.649 --> 00:07:22.659
that's kind of where things go but
 

00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:26.200
that's kind of where things go but
there's a near 20 percent transit

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:26.210
there's a near 20 percent transit
 

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.420
there's a near 20 percent transit
anything what bad would happen but on

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:28.430
anything what bad would happen but on
 

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:31.119
anything what bad would happen but on
the flip side we've never actually seen

00:07:31.119 --> 00:07:31.129
the flip side we've never actually seen
 

00:07:31.129 --> 00:07:33.100
the flip side we've never actually seen
or experienced nature at that energy

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:33.110
or experienced nature at that energy
 

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:36.550
or experienced nature at that energy
scale so we just don't know what happens
