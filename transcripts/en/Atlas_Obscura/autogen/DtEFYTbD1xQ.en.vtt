basics of what makes a mechanical watch
 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.990
basics of what makes a mechanical watch
tick so now we're going to take a look

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000
tick so now we're going to take a look
 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.249
tick so now we're going to take a look
at the tools that you have in front of

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259
at the tools that you have in front of
 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.050
at the tools that you have in front of
you yeah so the correct way to use these

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060
you yeah so the correct way to use these
 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.640
you yeah so the correct way to use these
screwdrivers is to hold them like this

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650
screwdrivers is to hold them like this
 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.859
screwdrivers is to hold them like this
and put your pointer finger on the top

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869
and put your pointer finger on the top
 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.530
and put your pointer finger on the top
and so what this does is it stabilizes

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540
and so what this does is it stabilizes
 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.730
and so what this does is it stabilizes
the screw the screwdriver

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740
the screw the screwdriver
 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.740
the screw the screwdriver
yeah and the tweezers are pretty similar

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750
yeah and the tweezers are pretty similar
 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.450
yeah and the tweezers are pretty similar
to the ones as you probably have at home

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460
to the ones as you probably have at home
 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.609

hold something down push something in
 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.960
hold something down push something in
the movements instead of using your

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970
the movements instead of using your
 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.639
the movements instead of using your
finger we use the plastic points it's

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649
finger we use the plastic points it's
 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.800
finger we use the plastic points it's
good and of course the loop so the loop

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810
good and of course the loop so the loop
 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.780

is a magnifying glass you wear over one

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790
is a magnifying glass you wear over one
 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.630
is a magnifying glass you wear over one
of your eyes

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640
of your eyes
 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.050
of your eyes
okay so let's get into it

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060
okay so let's get into it
 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.840
okay so let's get into it
so the first step before taking a part

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850
so the first step before taking a part
 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.730
so the first step before taking a part
of the watch is letting the power down

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740
of the watch is letting the power down
 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.320
of the watch is letting the power down
it's kind of like a car if you're going

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330
it's kind of like a car if you're going
 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.330
it's kind of like a car if you're going
to work on the engine of the car you

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340
to work on the engine of the car you
 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.160
to work on the engine of the car you
would turn the engine off first right so

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170
would turn the engine off first right so
 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.719
would turn the engine off first right so
you're kind of gonna want to brace using

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729
you're kind of gonna want to brace using
 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.610
you're kind of gonna want to brace using
your pinky and then also get your

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620
your pinky and then also get your
 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.320
your pinky and then also get your
pointer in there yeah my fingers have

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330
pointer in there yeah my fingers have
 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.780
pointer in there yeah my fingers have
never felt so fat than they do right now

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790
never felt so fat than they do right now
 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.540
never felt so fat than they do right now
I knew basically how timekeeping works

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550
I knew basically how timekeeping works
 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.360
I knew basically how timekeeping works
but just to understand when you look at

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370
but just to understand when you look at
 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.040
but just to understand when you look at
the back of a watch or the inside of a

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050
the back of a watch or the inside of a
 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.900
the back of a watch or the inside of a
movement what all of these pieces are

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910
movement what all of these pieces are
 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.420
movement what all of these pieces are
and how they work in harmony that's

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430
and how they work in harmony that's
 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.380
and how they work in harmony that's
something I don't feel like you feel

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390
something I don't feel like you feel
 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.180
something I don't feel like you feel
until you actually take it apart and try

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190
until you actually take it apart and try
 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.960
until you actually take it apart and try
and put it back together

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970
and put it back together
 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.310
and put it back together
so I was trying to watch where you were

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320
so I was trying to watch where you were
 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.770
so I was trying to watch where you were
putting your fingers because holding the

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780
putting your fingers because holding the
 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.510
putting your fingers because holding the
thing is not necessarily the most

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520
thing is not necessarily the most
 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.850
thing is not necessarily the most
intuitive thing to hold multiple things

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860
intuitive thing to hold multiple things
 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.680
intuitive thing to hold multiple things
at once there are certain parts in watch

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690
at once there are certain parts in watch
 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.199
at once there are certain parts in watch
movements that require coordination like

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209
movements that require coordination like
 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.790
movements that require coordination like
putting a train wheel bridge back into

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800
putting a train wheel bridge back into
 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.570
putting a train wheel bridge back into
place

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580
place
 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.370
place
you need to line up three different

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380
you need to line up three different
 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.470
you need to line up three different
wheels at the same time each of those

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480
wheels at the same time each of those
 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.060
wheels at the same time each of those
wheels has a pivot that needs to be in

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070
wheels has a pivot that needs to be in
 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.620
wheels has a pivot that needs to be in
exactly the same place and so

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630
exactly the same place and so
 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.870
exactly the same place and so
watchmaking is not just putting things

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880
watchmaking is not just putting things
 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.270
watchmaking is not just putting things
together it's also practicing focusing

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280
together it's also practicing focusing
 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.860
together it's also practicing focusing
and kind of meditating and getting into

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870
and kind of meditating and getting into
 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.870
