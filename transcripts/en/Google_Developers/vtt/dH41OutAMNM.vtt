00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.090
Enterprise is a
huge opportunity.

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.000
When most developers
think about Android,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.200
they look at the general
end user numbers,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.980
but often they forget about
the massive opportunity

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.140
available for business devices.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.680
My name is Matt, and
with Android for Work,

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.740
you can take advantage
of this huge opportunity.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.280
Did you know that
as of 2014, there

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.290
were 250 million
Android devices in use

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.280
in businesses around the world?

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.580
And it continues to grow
strongly in two flavors.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.070
Bring Your Own
Device, or BYOD, is

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.240
where the employee
owns their device

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.680
but their company
also allows them

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.840
to use it for work, currently at
175 million devices and growing

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.010
at 15% per year.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.140
On the other hand,
corporate liable

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.170
is where the company
owns their device

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.380
and typically only allows it
to be used for work, currently

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.520
around 75 million devices
and growing at 8% per year.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.170
Compare that to the 1 billion
Android devices in use today,

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.910
and that's already 25%
being used in businesses.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.770
So how do you reach
this massive market?

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.870
Start with Google Play
for Work to get your apps

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.864
into the hands of businesses.

00:01:07.864 --> 00:01:10.030
Google Play for Work provides
a dedicated storefront

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.400
to businesses using
Android for Work.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.920
Google Play for
Work, when combined

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.240
with Android for Work devices,
allows a whole set of control

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.730
and install options
for IT admins.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.920
This is why it's been integrated
by these top Enterprise

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.360
Mobility Management
companies, or EMMs.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.590
This gives your app
exposure to a broad range

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.410
of business customers.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.070
IT admins are able to
install your application

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.490
across an entire workforce
at the click of a button.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.730
We are working with more
EMMs to get them on board

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.650
as quickly as possible.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.540
Using Google Play for Work as
a developer is straightforward.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.790
You're able to ship your apps
to both Google Play and Google

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.870
Play for Work within the
Pricing and Distribution

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.180
tab of the familiar
Play Developer Console.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.080
But what if you have
a paid application?

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.840
At I/O 2015, we made
it possible for IT

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.000
admins to purchase
paid apps in bulk

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.980
within Google Play for Work.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.930
It's now possible
for an IT admin

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.560
to buy multiple licenses of
your app in one transaction

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.360
and then distribute
them to employees

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.400
who are using Android for Work.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.600
This gives you the
opportunity to grow your user

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.660
base more quickly.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.790
The licenses are
owned by the company,

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.650
so if an employee
leaves, then the company

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.850
can transfer that
license to another user.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.310
That means it is
critical for you

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.210
to keep track of which users
have licenses assigned.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.920
We recommend that your app
uses the Google Play Licensing

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.150
API to periodically
check ownership.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.020
Now, it's important
to understand

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.930
that IT admins for
businesses typically

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.400
have stricter security
concerns than regular users.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.120
Here's a quick
checklist of items

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.080
to keep your eye on as
you're developing your app.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.970
Firstly, IT admins will
scrutinize your permissions

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.432
closely before making your app
available to their employees,

00:02:53.432 --> 00:02:55.390
so make sure you're only
requesting permissions

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.380
that you really need.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.130
Make sure user data is
secured and encrypted

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.610
in transit and while
on your servers.

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.675
Consider also describing
the security measures

00:03:04.675 --> 00:03:08.660
that you take in your
Google Play app description.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.810
Data leaks caused
either accidentally

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.660
or maliciously
from your employees

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.620
will really put
businesses off your app.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.140
Set authorization policies
within your business

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.120
to minimize the
number of employees

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.680
that can access user data.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.760
Finally, avoid
features that might

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.780
cause information
security issues,

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.750
like sharing with
social networks,

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.770
or allow these to
be disabled by IT

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.060
admins using managed
configuration

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.040
through the Android App
Restrictions framework.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.310
For more information
on app restrictions

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.120
and testing your enterprise app,
watch our previous video here.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.060
So does your app
have the potential

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.690
to make a difference
to an entire workforce?

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.490
Whether it be barcode
scanners for warehouse staff,

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.080
collaboration tools for
remote office workers,

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.470
or stock market
tickers for finance,

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.100
there are countless
opportunities

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.200
opening up with Android for
Work and Google Play for Work.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.040
Which one is knocking
on your door?

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.790
