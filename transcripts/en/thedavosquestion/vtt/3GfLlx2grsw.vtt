00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.899
&gt;&gt;The climate conference in Copenhagen has
been discussed here very

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:09.019
much in Davos and we are -- to me, it's very,
very important that we

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.410
don't give up.
Don't we don't feel it's over and over now.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.680
I think this year should be used to realize
that we did not obtain what

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.460
we wanted to get but then we should not forget
that we have to get it

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.839
still.
So this conference in Davos, I think the green

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:31.789
economy has to be
accepted a new way of having a economy of

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.190
the future.
The green economy will create jobs and will

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.680
have ability for upon the
climate.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.600
So my hope is off to Mexico next December,
that we will not forget.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.410
We still have to get results in the climate
conference journey.
