00:00:22.391 --> 00:00:25.510

a bunch of,

what do you call it?

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.870
Their promotion for F is for family that comes out next Tuesday at midnight on

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.220

So then we could do with season three.
Yeah,
yeah,

15
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.200
yeah,
yeah.
We'll see what happens.
I um,

16
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.340
I don't know.
It's been such a whirlwind of press.

17
00:01:00.341 --> 00:01:05.170
What the fuck did I do yesterday or two nights
ago I was at something.

18
00:01:05.171 --> 00:01:06.790
I wear a sport coat.
I do know

19
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.540
that I have absolutely no recollection where I was two nights ago.

20
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.280
Last night we went over to Netflix,
this new building,
the taking over the world,

21
00:01:16.281 --> 00:01:17.730
the new building and uh,

22
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.120
<v 2>oh,
I know what I did.
I don't want,
I did.</v>

23
00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.780
<v 1>There was for Emmy consideration,
they added,</v>

24
00:01:25.781 --> 00:01:30.781
they had the thing there and you sat there on a pen panel and it was a Judd

25
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.830
Apatow,
Chelsea handler.
Uh,

26
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.070
the woman who created friends.
I can tell you right now,

27
00:01:39.071 --> 00:01:41.920
if I created friends,
I would never come out of the house again.

28
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.300
I'd have so much goddamn money.

29
00:01:43.301 --> 00:01:47.710
I would just be sitting in there with the biggest drum kit ever.

30
00:01:47.711 --> 00:01:51.400
And I'd have a fucking helicopter.
I don't know where I'd be.
It,

31
00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.970
I'd be all fucking weird.
I'd be like growing my nail and cutting my nails,

32
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.890
you know,
I'd be coward.
Fucking huge.

33
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.103
<v 0>MMM.</v>

34
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.020
<v 1>And it was me and then the guy from,
uh,</v>

35
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.930
the Santa Clarita Diet and it was pretty cool.

36
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.670
You got to sit there and I'd be glad to tell us

37
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.430
<v 2>hello.
When you're creating your show,</v>

38
00:02:09.431 --> 00:02:12.130
what is it that you do when you're creating the show?

39
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.180
<v 1>MMM.</v>

40
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.480
<v 0>Okay.</v>

41
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.330
<v 2>This AI stuff and the show,
is it based on you?</v>

42
00:02:17.331 --> 00:02:20.930
Is it made up or is it something else that we don't know all together?

43
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.280
<v 1>And you answered all the questions
and I hope you get out of it unscathed,</v>

44
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.660
which I think I did.
Sorry.

45
00:02:30.661 --> 00:02:35.340
So what's funny was I actually wore a sport coat and then Mike Price,

46
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.800
uh,
cocreative f a family,

47
00:02:37.801 --> 00:02:40.740
the Great Mike Price from the Simpsons who I could not do f is for family

48
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.190
without him.
He was dressed casual.

49
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.370
So last night when we went to the,
the new Netflix building,

50
00:02:47.371 --> 00:02:48.480
they're taking over the world.

51
00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.883
<v 0>MMM.</v>

52
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.560
<v 1>I,
I said I am not going to,
I'd sit in the,
I go,
you know what,</v>

53
00:02:53.561 --> 00:02:55.270
I'm just going to wear a fucking button down,
blah,
blah.

54
00:02:55.271 --> 00:02:57.670
And as I pull in Mike Price as a jacket on,

55
00:02:57.671 --> 00:03:00.130
I got you one fucking jacket on the bum.

56
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.400
So we were laughing about that and everybody else had on a jacket.

57
00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:07.030
So I just look like the,
uh,
the fucking artists showing up.
Like,
hey man,

58
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:09.870
I just like roll out of bed,
man.
And Yeah.
You know,
whenever you're in feel.

59
00:03:09.871 --> 00:03:12.440
And I just put it on man.
Um,

60
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.450
but we sat through two episodes,
the first two episodes.

61
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.520
It was a friendly though,
you know,

62
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.990
everybody pretty much in the crowd was on the show and they were laughing,

63
00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.460
having a good time.
So I hope you guys enjoy it.
Um,

64
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.230
I was on rich Ising yesterday.

65
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.860
I don't know if he can go to some rich i's and.net and watch it.

66
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.640
I had a great time.
So thank you to him.
And uh,
then I did,

67
00:03:33.641 --> 00:03:37.150
Bill Simmons had a great time on that one.
Um,

68
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.590
and I got coming up next week.
I know I'm doing Craig Ferguson,

69
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.320
who is the greatest special I've ever seen.

70
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.470
I'm doing his and uh,
there's something else.

71
00:03:50.471 --> 00:03:53.260
Somebody look at my phone,
I should,
but I'm trying to promote these things.

72
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.040
<v 0>MMM [inaudible]</v>

73
00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.410
<v 1>before I,
uh,
doing that would probably be good.
Right.</v>

74
00:04:00.411 --> 00:04:03.770
Rather than telling you after I did them.
I mean,
that would make sense.
Bill.

75
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.160
The whole thing about promotions,
let people know something's coming.

76
00:04:07.161 --> 00:04:10.960
Not that it came and went.
Oh,
I know.
I actually,

77
00:04:10.961 --> 00:04:14.970
I have a Gig for the California Highway Patrol Booboo,
but at do

78
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.180
[inaudible].
Oh yeah,
I'm going to be on my best behavior.

79
00:04:22.181 --> 00:04:26.290
You cannot know enough cops.
There's some great life advice.

80
00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.280
You have no idea when you're going to snap,
you just walk into a bank,

81
00:04:30.281 --> 00:04:31.870
you're going to make a deposit.
You just say,
Hey,

82
00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:35.740
what if I just pulled my shirt up over my head and passed them a note?
You know,

83
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.070
you have no idea when for some stupid fucking reason you do that.

84
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.240
And then unfortunate,
hopefully when the cop shows up,
he's like,
get out of crap.

85
00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.580
Oh wait,
is that bill?
What are you doing?
Huh?
No.
All right,

86
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.270
well we'll take care of this.
Everything's fine.

87
00:04:49.271 --> 00:04:52.150
There was no gun already that takes you outside of what the fuck you gotta get

88
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.790
Outta here.
Get outta here.
His son of a bitch.
You like dead.

89
00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.850
And that right there is called white privilege.
I don't know who's not white.

90
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:01.740
You listened to that.
You know,

91
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.150
we times I've gone in and robbed the bank and it's,
you know,

92
00:05:04.151 --> 00:05:06.880
I've never been successful,
but I've never gone to jail for it.

93
00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.980
It's because I am a white male,
you know,
and I might get in trouble for this.

94
00:05:11.981 --> 00:05:14.710
I might lose some of my privileges if I let non.
Why do you smell that?

95
00:05:14.711 --> 00:05:19.060
I've actually on six,
maybe seven if you want to get technical.

96
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.650
First Time it was,
I made a joke,
but on say six and a half different occasions,

97
00:05:23.651 --> 00:05:27.580
I made an attempt to rob a bank I was caught but knew the cop when they will

98
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.150
come in in five out of six of those,
another time the guy was like,
oh,

99
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.760
you look just like me and you let me go.

100
00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.920
Those are all true stories.
Um,
and you can add those to the,

101
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.550
to the non fake news in your life.
Um,

102
00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:48.480
I flew a fucking helicopter this morning,
but getting back into it,

103
00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:53.240
I'm up over 120 hours a,
my auto rotations are looking okay.

104
00:05:53.241 --> 00:05:58.130
Last week they were fucking horrific.
Put the collective down,
knows,
followed it.

105
00:05:58.131 --> 00:06:01.730
And I didn't go aft cyclic and it was like,
oh my God,
am I going to die

106
00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.930
getting good on the radio again.
I got this great fucking APP.

107
00:06:07.931 --> 00:06:11.200
If you want to listen.
Uh,
anybody else there is into aviation or something.

108
00:06:11.201 --> 00:06:12.970
I just,
you know,

109
00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.970
cause you don't want to sound like a fucking moron when you're making your
calls,

110
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.770
which uh,
you know,
I do want a regular basis.
There's an app called live a t c.

111
00:06:20.771 --> 00:06:22.660
Dot net.
It's really cool.

112
00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.510
And you just click and you can listen to whatever airport you want.

113
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.870
I was listening,
you know,
when my flights taken off,
you know,

114
00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.100
I don't care about what does it,

115
00:06:30.101 --> 00:06:34.570
magnetic deviation or whatever the fuck it is from my cell phone.

116
00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:39.850
I wasn't magnetic something or there
retardation.
I can't,

117
00:06:39.851 --> 00:06:40.420
I don't remember.

118
00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.790
All I know is I'm going back and I'm going through all my ground school again,

119
00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.030
trying to remember all this shit.
I'm reading about fucking weather and a,

120
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.090
I'm having a great time,

121
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.670
get myself back to where my skill level was right before my lovely daughter was

122
00:06:51.671 --> 00:06:55.420
born.
And,
um,
I don't know.
I'm totally into it,

123
00:06:55.421 --> 00:06:59.470
but the only thing I don't like about those Robinson's is that the mass bumping

124
00:06:59.471 --> 00:07:02.660
in the low Gi pushovers and someone was telling me today that they add,

125
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.160
have a fully articulated rotor system.
We didn't have to fucking deal with that.

126
00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:07.900
And for those of you who don't fly,

127
00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.950
a mass bumping is basically when the blades attack the mast

128
00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:15.920
and break off the ELA copter.

129
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:21.050
If they don't get bent and then slam into the cockpit and cut your fucking legs

130
00:07:21.051 --> 00:07:25.010
off or you right in half,
you know,
that could happen.

131
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:29.720
So that happened on those bell helicopters I guess that they had in Vietnam.

132
00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.980
And uh,
you can't,
you know,
when they would fly low to the ground,

133
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:35.240
they'd go up the hill.
Um,
you know,

134
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.610
cause they were trying to stay at the tree line so they wouldn't get shot at

135
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.240
they way up in the air and they would just fly and they'd go up the hill and

136
00:07:41.241 --> 00:07:43.850
then when they would dive down the backside,
that's the thing.

137
00:07:43.851 --> 00:07:45.710
When you push forward with the stick like that,

138
00:07:45.711 --> 00:07:49.220
you're not supposed to do that in a semi articulated rotor system.

139
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.250
What happens to the,
see if I can remember.

140
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:56.030
Basically what happens is the main rotor is still spinning,

141
00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.690
but it's no longer producing lift with the helicopter,
right?

142
00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.300
They've sort of been this low g thing.

143
00:08:01.301 --> 00:08:06.210
So what happens is is if it goes counterclockwise,
you main rotor,
your,

144
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:11.060
your rear tail rotor is going to be on back behind you on the left.

145
00:08:11.061 --> 00:08:11.690
And so you're,

146
00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:15.590
it's still going to be compensating for the torque that the main rotor is no

147
00:08:15.591 --> 00:08:16.430
longer producing.

148
00:08:16.431 --> 00:08:19.280
So it's going to push you over and you're going to roll over to the,
right.

149
00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:22.790
Now what's fucked up is as you roll over to the right,

150
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.360
the way to get out of it is counterintuitive.

151
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:29.810
You would think that you would move the stick left.
You don't,

152
00:08:29.811 --> 00:08:34.811
you smooth it slightly back after you go after to reload the main rotor to get

153
00:08:35.271 --> 00:08:36.081
back underneath it.

154
00:08:36.081 --> 00:08:38.510
So when she's fucking watching the ground coming up on the right,

155
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:42.560
like I don't want to go there.
You,
you move the stick.

156
00:08:42.561 --> 00:08:45.200
Like you want to do a backward somersault rather than roll back up.

157
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.330
It's completely fucked up.
You've got one chance to do it.

158
00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:50.480
If you pull back too fast,
I think he chopped your tail off.

159
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.950
So there's that,
which is why I don't fly.
If there's any sort of wind,

160
00:08:54.951 --> 00:08:57.960
I don't fly.
But you know,

161
00:08:57.961 --> 00:09:00.870
there's a danger with anything that you do if you're not risking,

162
00:09:00.871 --> 00:09:03.130
are you really living?
Um,

163
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:07.440
I have to get on Instagram and I have to become some sort of motivational

164
00:09:07.441 --> 00:09:11.220
comedian.
That's what I want to do.
I want to start giving you guys nauseated.

165
00:09:11.221 --> 00:09:14.520
Fucking life lessons,
you know,

166
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:17.700
is I'm believing a gym or a fucking juice bar.

167
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.800
What is with all these fucking cops on the,

168
00:09:19.801 --> 00:09:24.270
on Instagram acting like they're trying to inspire you.
It's,
you're not,

169
00:09:24.271 --> 00:09:26.730
you're trying to show me what great shape you're it

170
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:32.370
Hashtag doing this one for you guys.
The fuck out of here.

171
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:37.890
Um,
Instagram whores,
male and female.
All right,

172
00:09:37.891 --> 00:09:41.970
so the Celtics,
they want to game.
Holy Shit.
Holy Shit.

173
00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:44.340
So we have game five tonight,

174
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:49.400
which every Celtic fan knows that we are basically eight quarters away.

175
00:09:49.591 --> 00:09:51.720
If we can survive the next eight quarters,

176
00:09:51.721 --> 00:09:53.760
we are eight now actually not eight quarters.

177
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:58.820
The next 11 quarters we are 11 quarters away from Kelly Olynyk taking over this

178
00:10:01.051 --> 00:10:03.810
fucking series and getting us to the finals.

179
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:06.300
I know I say a Thomas' out.

180
00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:11.460
I know they got fucking look Rod
Kevin Love.

181
00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:15.570
They've got all these motherfuckers.
I understand.
Okay.

182
00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.890
Do you know what Boston has?

183
00:10:16.891 --> 00:10:21.690
We got hot so we always have never have explosive speed.

184
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:23.160
We have a strick,

185
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:27.330
no explosive newness with all our draft players.

186
00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:31.320
If he's got a quick first step and can dunk where like now pass that guy on.

187
00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:36.420
Where can this guy do look like he's going to trip over his own feet and he's

188
00:10:36.421 --> 00:10:40.150
white.
Gimme that guy you always have.

189
00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:43.770
And then we got the to like the,
the bruise and black dudes,

190
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.170
but we just never had those above the rim guys.

191
00:10:46.171 --> 00:10:48.690
We just don't have explosive guys.
You know Isaiah is,
but you know,

192
00:10:48.691 --> 00:10:53.040
he's like five foot eight.
So all I'm saying,
okay,
but you know,

193
00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:56.460
Crowder,
he's going to get a say,
you know something.
The younger kids though,

194
00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.420
Brown Bradley,
those guys,
I love how Bradley keeps trying to dunk on the brunt.

195
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:03.690
He keeps missing the fucking rim though.
That one.
I liked that guy.

196
00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.200
So anyways,
I don't know what I'm talking about.

197
00:11:07.201 --> 00:11:10.110
All I know is the remaining Celtics,

198
00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:15.570
just all you gotta do is get us to the fourth quarter end game seven.

199
00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.690
All right?
And then the garden's gonna come alive.

200
00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:23.340
Galli Galli Galli and he's going to hit a fucking zone.

201
00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:27.990
And I don't know what's going to happen.
He's going to be so in the zone.

202
00:11:27.991 --> 00:11:30.060
He's not even gonna need a headband anymore to keep his,

203
00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:32.470
his locks out of his face.
And he's just going to,

204
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:35.430
I don't know if he's going to start draining threes and that's going to be all

205
00:11:35.431 --> 00:11:39.630
she wrote for the land.
Okay.
Anybody want to put money on it?

206
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:42.720
I'll put money on it right now if we can somehow survive.

207
00:11:42.721 --> 00:11:45.540
The next 11 court is Kelly.
That was not a Flook.

208
00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.390
Everybody thinks it's a fluke.

209
00:11:48.391 --> 00:11:51.930
I'm telling you that man has ice water in his veins.

210
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:58.200
Arctic fucking polar bear swimming around in his fucking veins,

211
00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:03.010
microscopic walks.
I'm telling you the thing is he's just bored.

212
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:09.030
He doesn't give a fuck about game five one through four or even games six or

213
00:12:09.371 --> 00:12:12.580
even the first fucking half.
Actually no,
he had a good game game seven.

214
00:12:12.581 --> 00:12:17.581
We just have to get to game seven and the man that I've always been confused as

215
00:12:18.851 --> 00:12:20.350
to why he was on the team.

216
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.280
I once again got hit with a cold bucket of reality of bill.

217
00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:28.630
You're just a stand up comic.
You don't know shit about sports led Danny.

218
00:12:28.631 --> 00:12:32.380
Ange make the calls and if Danny Ainge says,

219
00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:37.410
Kelly Olynyk is the fucking man that I am standing down.

220
00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:41.470
You wait Cleveland.
I know you're fucking nervous.
You are.

221
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:46.300
You are so scared that we're somehow going to win game five in game six without

222
00:12:46.301 --> 00:12:50.320
Isaiah Thomas or Kelly Olynyk gets dunked on and people go right around up.

223
00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.840
You fucking wait man.
We get to game seven.
It's over.

224
00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:56.080
That man shows up to play.

225
00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.720
All right.
I'm an idiot.
Anyways.

226
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:06.650
Carely carely um,
let's uh,
let's move on to the,
uh,

227
00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:11.560
the predators.
Holy Shit.
Hey,
anybody in Montreal,
the Montreal Canadian fans,

228
00:13:11.561 --> 00:13:14.710
did you notice that the guy that you traded for,
cause he was too flashy.

229
00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.980
You know,
you didn't like his personality.
PK Sue Bonn.

230
00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.500
It was really your front office on this one,

231
00:13:20.501 --> 00:13:25.450
but I'm going to play blame the fan base yet another form of Canadian leading a

232
00:13:25.451 --> 00:13:29.890
team to the finals,
leading a team to the final level is my front door.

233
00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.540
By the way,
if you want to what that beep was,

234
00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:33.010
I didn't leave the refrigerator open.

235
00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:38.110
I'm so hoping that the predators win the Cup because,
um,
the Bruins,

236
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:40.630
we'll never catch the Montreal community Canadians and the amount of Stanley

237
00:13:40.631 --> 00:13:41.201
cups they have.

238
00:13:41.201 --> 00:13:45.790
So all I can do is tease them about the guys that they got rid of that then went

239
00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:50.290
onto win cups elsewhere.
Um,
is it petty?
Oh,
I think it's,

240
00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.620
I think it's very petty.
Who Do you like tonight?
Games.
Seven Games.

241
00:13:53.621 --> 00:13:57.970
Seven penguins.
Penguins.
Where's the fucking Ottawa senators?

242
00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:01.780
Where is that game?
It was in an Ottawa.
If you're in Pittsburgh,

243
00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:02.591
you want to go to the game,

244
00:14:02.591 --> 00:14:05.000
you can probably just walk up to the gate and buy a ticket.
Cognos is,

245
00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:09.280
it's a transient city.
You know,
it's a capital.
People don't give a shit.

246
00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:11.980
They're from other places.
They're Calgary fans that live there.

247
00:14:11.981 --> 00:14:15.400
Edmonton blue jackets.
They don't give a fuck.

248
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:19.660
They're not going to the Goddamn game.
Uh,
what do you guys think?
I actually,

249
00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:22.330
for some fucked up reason,
I th I think,

250
00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.770
I think auto was going to win only because,
um,

251
00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.870
I dunno if the penguins have had a little bit of goaltender issue there.

252
00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:33.140
That's the only reason.

253
00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.700
That's what I'm guessing the 10 seconds that I've paid attention.

254
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:38.410
Why do I talk about sports right now?

255
00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:41.650
I'm too fucking busy running around doing podcast.
Um,
you know what?

256
00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:45.860
I was so busy last week.
I forgot to read the,
uh,
the question.

257
00:14:45.861 --> 00:14:50.740
So let me read this.
Here's another person giving me shit about bills.
Fake News,

258
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:53.870
Delta Rant,
Billy fake fucking news.

259
00:14:53.871 --> 00:14:57.470
I was listening to your podcast from last Monday as I was sitting on a Delta

260
00:14:57.471 --> 00:14:59.930
flight heading to Los Angeles from Austin,

261
00:14:59.931 --> 00:15:04.140
Texas was that partner to the fucking story and one of your readers brought up

262
00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:07.370
the Delta Airlines incident where a dad was threatened to get kicked off and

263
00:15:07.371 --> 00:15:11.750
jailed if he didn't stop complaining and fall in line as I was listening to your

264
00:15:11.751 --> 00:15:14.000
useless fucking rent.
Still a huge fan.

265
00:15:14.001 --> 00:15:17.510
I noticed how uninformed both you and your reader,
we're on the situation.

266
00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:19.700
All right.
Tell him out here.
First of all,

267
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:24.370
if you guys are going to come at me with uninformed and fake news,
I,

268
00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:28.550
you new to the podcast.
I don't really,

269
00:15:28.551 --> 00:15:32.180
I just commented on for fucking series.
I've probably watched three minutes in.

270
00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.990
My job is to make you laugh.
It's not to get facts.

271
00:15:35.991 --> 00:15:38.240
What the fuck he think he listened into here,
sir?

272
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:42.860
I could have easily Google that and figured out what I was talking about.

273
00:15:42.861 --> 00:15:47.861
Don't come at me like you some sort of road scholar like I'm impressed that

274
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:51.110
you're going from Los Angeles to Austin,
Texas.

275
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:55.430
Are you going to keep it weird when you get to Austin,
Texas?
Austin,

276
00:15:55.431 --> 00:16:00.431
Texas is one of the most overrated overpopulated fucking cities in this goddamn

277
00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:05.090
country.
You know why cause La concert like you keep moving there.

278
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:11.200
Who actually if he teach you research you'd realize it or not from La nor am I

279
00:16:11.631 --> 00:16:14.180
from us and you.
Let me tell you somebody,
I don't give a fuck where you from.

280
00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:19.820
The mere fact that you're dumb enough to try to get fucking accurate information

281
00:16:19.821 --> 00:16:22.100
from this podcast and you think that I'm uninformed.

282
00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:24.380
I used to do a radio show called uninformed,

283
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:29.270
which with better call Saul's star,

284
00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:32.450
breakout star Joe de Rosa,

285
00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:37.480
the teen idols sensation sensation from the now defunct opie and Anthony

286
00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:44.210
Program.
That's what really broke up ob,

287
00:16:44.211 --> 00:16:45.230
Anthony and Jimmy.

288
00:16:45.231 --> 00:16:50.231
It was the sheer star power of Joe to Rosa coming in once every 16 weeks.

289
00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:56.480
They just all had to go their separate ways because when they came back into the

290
00:16:56.481 --> 00:16:57.980
studio,
when they looked at one another,

291
00:16:57.981 --> 00:17:02.981
all they can be reminded of was was the the force of Joe to Rosa's talent.

292
00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:07.280
All right,
do you want to look that one up there?
Go on one.

293
00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:11.550
Your flight from La to Austin and he said as I was listening and blah,
blah,

294
00:17:11.551 --> 00:17:15.710
blah blah.
Um,
okay.

295
00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:18.860
I know.
Okay.
First the seat that,
that,

296
00:17:18.861 --> 00:17:23.000
that the dad was bitching about being sold to another passenger was actually his

297
00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:26.810
18 year old son seat.
All right,
now where did you get this?

298
00:17:26.811 --> 00:17:30.320
At delta.com cause they're not as,
I don't trust these guys either.

299
00:17:30.321 --> 00:17:33.410
I don't trust you either.
How do I know you're not fucking Eddie Delta,

300
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:37.970
son of a Ulysses Delta who fucking started the airline,
um,

301
00:17:37.971 --> 00:17:41.870
who we put on an earlier flight by buying a separate ticket instead of notifying

302
00:17:41.871 --> 00:17:45.530
delta that he was changing his son flight to an earlier flight doing this.

303
00:17:45.531 --> 00:17:50.040
He thought he could magically have an open seat to him for his toddler who is

304
00:17:50.041 --> 00:17:54.960
under two.
But that wasn't the case.
Jesus.
This guy's spread in the semen out,
Huh?

305
00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:00.630
He's kind of an 18 year old and a toddler.
You go buddy,
keep banging away.

306
00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:04.410
Uh,
you see,
when you decide to put your son,
don't fucking go.

307
00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:08.280
You see like you're fucking talking down to me.
You dumb cunt.

308
00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:12.960
All you did was researching my job,
sir,
is to make people laugh.

309
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:15.570
That's it.
I,
my job is not the fucking,

310
00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:20.700
I don't have fucking time to figure shit out.
What am I still in school?

311
00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.390
I got in this business to not have a job.

312
00:18:24.391 --> 00:18:26.670
How am I going to sit here and researcher guys fucking emails.

313
00:18:26.671 --> 00:18:30.330
I don't care what you write to me,
unless it sounds totally ridiculous.

314
00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:32.400
I'm going to treat him as long.

315
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:36.030
I've also flown a lot and I've noticed that they don't give a fuck about you.

316
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.570
I remember one time I was on a flight and they had the intercom on,

317
00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:44.760
so God damn loud,
you needed like earplugs and I said to the stores,
I go,

318
00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:48.480
is there any way you can turn that down a little bit?
And she just goes,
no,

319
00:18:48.481 --> 00:18:50.580
I'm sorry sir.
There's nothing we can do about it.

320
00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:55.920
It's like you're telling me that they installed an intercom system without a

321
00:18:55.921 --> 00:19:00.750
volume knob and it was at full blast.
That's what you're telling me.
It's there.

322
00:19:00.751 --> 00:19:04.530
Why are you being difficult?
I'm not being difficult.

323
00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.730
All right with you fucking crooked toes.
All right.

324
00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.890
You see when you decided to put your son on an earlier flight by buying another

325
00:19:10.891 --> 00:19:13.210
ticket while not telling Delta,
they assume that the,

326
00:19:13.211 --> 00:19:17.190
the 18 year old son did not make it on his original flight because he didn't

327
00:19:17.191 --> 00:19:20.730
check in and they weren't notified that the dad bought a completely separate

328
00:19:20.731 --> 00:19:24.990
ticket.
So they gave the seat away to a standby passenger per standard protocol.

329
00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:29.220
Also Faa regulation disallows a child under two to sit in a standard seat

330
00:19:29.221 --> 00:19:31.080
without the proper child seat in harness.

331
00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:32.970
So there's another thing that dad got wrong.

332
00:19:32.971 --> 00:19:34.770
You can't have a child with a different names.

333
00:19:34.771 --> 00:19:38.220
Sit in a seat that he sold to your 18 year old son.
All right,
fair enough.

334
00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:42.050
Imagine all the issues this would cause.
Cause if we,

335
00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:45.150
what if we allowed for anyone to use his,

336
00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:48.210
any ticket that was issued in someone else's name,

337
00:19:48.211 --> 00:19:52.560
his mistake was that he didn't check in and notified Delta and should have paid

338
00:19:52.561 --> 00:19:56.490
the change fee to send his son on an earlier flight with the same ticket and

339
00:19:56.491 --> 00:20:00.030
then buy another ticket for his toddler if he had the proper safety harness for

340
00:20:00.031 --> 00:20:03.240
the toddler.
Uh,
tickets are not transferable to another passenger.

341
00:20:03.241 --> 00:20:06.030
I'm not defending the flight attendant who I thought said some things that were

342
00:20:06.031 --> 00:20:08.010
inappropriate by threatening jail,
et cetera.

343
00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.920
That's really what I was commenting on,
buddy.
All right.

344
00:20:10.921 --> 00:20:14.280
That they're sitting there acting like you did something in the Pentagon.
Um,

345
00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:14.701
however,

346
00:20:14.701 --> 00:20:18.330
the dad was completely wrong to think he can somehow put his oldest son on an

347
00:20:18.331 --> 00:20:22.080
earlier flight home and then use original ticket.
What this guy,

348
00:20:22.081 --> 00:20:23.640
he's got an 18 year old and a two year.

349
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.700
He's too busy fucking without a condom to research all of this.

350
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:29.400
How about having a little empathy for him,
sir,

351
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.410
on your Los Angeles to Austin flight fucking jackass.

352
00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:39.570
What is the oldest sons?
Um,
which is okay.
Put his.
Okay.
However,

353
00:20:39.571 --> 00:20:43.260
the dad was completely wrong to think he can somehow put his oldest son on an

354
00:20:43.261 --> 00:20:45.690
earlier flight home and then use his original ticket,

355
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.620
which is in his oldest son's name.

356
00:20:47.621 --> 00:20:50.920
How many times are you going to say the same thing on the two year old toddler?

357
00:20:50.921 --> 00:20:54.820
So he and she can,
he or she can sit in that seat of Delta into the World War.

358
00:20:56.170 --> 00:21:00.460
Just wanted to clear up your fake news rent.
You misinformed continental.
Good.

359
00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:03.250
Everything's fake news is,
it wasn't fake news,
sir.

360
00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:06.670
It was just me trying to make you fucking laugh.
Okay.
That's all it was.
Okay.

361
00:21:06.671 --> 00:21:09.160
I'm glad you researched and cleared all of that up.

362
00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:11.160
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

363
00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:14.820
<v 1>At the end of the day,
at the end of the day,</v>

364
00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:19.920
I'm just here to make you laugh.
Okay,
so please people for the love of God.

365
00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:24.240
All right,
and stop acting like you know I can't do what you just did.

366
00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:29.250
Okay,
girl stabs boyfriend and avoid jail time because it was damaged her career.

367
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:31.050
Now what am I supposed to do here,
sir?

368
00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:34.860
Am I really supposed to fucking sit here and research this as if someone's going

369
00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:38.940
to go to jail with the jokes that I do or should I just take it at last so I can

370
00:21:38.941 --> 00:21:40.740
get on with my fucking life?

371
00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:46.950
Here's the deal.
Why don't you got,
why don't you be the fucking the fact police.

372
00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:49.500
All right,
I'll do the rent the next week.
You can correct me.

373
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:52.950
That was my uninformed showed that would Joe to Rosa.
We just pick a topic.

374
00:21:52.951 --> 00:21:56.040
We'd go off on it,
we'd be completely wrong,
and then we'd bring an expert in.

375
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:57.210
That was literally the shell.

376
00:21:57.211 --> 00:22:00.540
People would learn things and there was laughs to be had.

377
00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:04.390
All right girl stabs boyfriend and avoided jail time because it would damage

378
00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:06.780
your career.
Hey there,
Billy beats.

379
00:22:06.781 --> 00:22:10.020
I'm sure a million people tweeted an email you this article.
Actually,
no,

380
00:22:10.021 --> 00:22:13.110
they didn't.
Well,
maybe they did.
I don't know.
This girl stabbed her boyfriend,

381
00:22:13.111 --> 00:22:16.680
but the judge agreed that any sentencing would damage her future career in

382
00:22:16.681 --> 00:22:20.640
medicine.
Jesus Christ.
Go Fuck yourself around.
Let me,
let me read this here.

383
00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:26.200
Go to the page.
Oh,
here we go.
Click here.
Oh,
this.

384
00:22:26.201 --> 00:22:30.150
This is UK news.
God knows this probably happened in America.

385
00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:34.920
I find the UK people love to fucking did you see this?

386
00:22:34.921 --> 00:22:39.780
That happened in your country.
You guys are all fat and stupid.
All right,

387
00:22:39.781 --> 00:22:42.900
here we go.
Wow.
Jeez.
Ah,
wow.
I see what happens.

388
00:22:42.901 --> 00:22:45.000
She's got this little angel smirk on her face.

389
00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:49.310
Aspiring surgeon Levina Woodward admits attack,

390
00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:54.180
but judge the first sentencing because of her extraordinary talent.
What?

391
00:22:54.181 --> 00:22:56.700
He blew her back in his fucking chambers

392
00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.510
and Oxford University.

393
00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:04.890
Studient who's wider than my fucking legs.

394
00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:09.150
Stabbed her boyfriend with a bread knife.
Okay.
It's a bread knife.

395
00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:13.830
May Not go to jail because it could damage your prospects of a medical career.

396
00:23:13.831 --> 00:23:17.610
Accord has heard well what sort of training and maybe she could've stabbed them

397
00:23:17.611 --> 00:23:21.300
and sewed him up real quick.
Aspiring hat surgeon,

398
00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:28.490
Levenia would-would 24 punched and stabbed her boyfriend during an alcohol drug

399
00:23:28.891 --> 00:23:32.190
fueled row at Christ church college.

400
00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:36.640
This is on the guardian.com is this credible?

401
00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:41.320
She so she's on drugs and she's drunk and she punched and stabbed her boyfriend.

402
00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:43.750
She admitted unlawfully wounding,

403
00:23:43.751 --> 00:23:48.350
the Cambridge University student who she met on the dating app.

404
00:23:48.351 --> 00:23:52.460
Tinder.
All right,
well not to blame the victim,
but what did he do?

405
00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:56.270
You can do that with men.
What did he do?
Judge Ian,

406
00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:59.360
they're always named Ian over there.
Ian Pringle.

407
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.780
Nigel or Ian QC.

408
00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:09.110
I'm sitting at Oxford Crown Court.
Oh,
this is like the school court.

409
00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:10.363
Is that what it is?

410
00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:14.450
That she'd go to trial at the fucking school that's taking her money?

411
00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:15.381
I don't know.

412
00:24:15.381 --> 00:24:19.850
Said he would take an exceptional course and defer sentence for four months

413
00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:23.090
hinting that Woodward would not be jailed because of her talent.

414
00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:26.330
It seems to me that this was a one off.

415
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:33.320
This was a one off drunk,
drugged up stabbing.

416
00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:38.090
Is that what goes on in England?
If you go to Oxford,
they give you one free pass.

417
00:24:38.091 --> 00:24:40.400
As long as it's a bread knife and not a steak knife.

418
00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:45.230
A complete one off to prevent this extraordinary,

419
00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:47.270
extraordinary able young talent,

420
00:24:47.271 --> 00:24:52.250
young lady lady from not following her long held desire to enter the profession

421
00:24:52.251 --> 00:24:56.250
she wishes to would be a sentence.
Uh,
would be,
uh,

422
00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:59.240
which would be a sentence which would be too severe.

423
00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:03.680
There's some fucking judge speak to enter the profession she wishes to would be

424
00:25:03.681 --> 00:25:07.700
a sentence which would be too severe.
He said,
that's sounding fake.

425
00:25:07.701 --> 00:25:11.450
That sounds like somebody's trying to sound like a judge.
What you did.

426
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:15.350
We'll never,
I know leave you,
but it was pretty awful.
Pretty awful.

427
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:20.060
That's an understatement.
And normally it would attract a custodial sentence.

428
00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:24.170
She's going to be a janitor,
whether it's immediate or suspended.

429
00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:27.260
He said Woodward who lives in Milan,

430
00:25:27.261 --> 00:25:31.640
Italy with the mother stabbed her then boyfriend and the leg after punching him

431
00:25:31.641 --> 00:25:35.150
in the face,
it was below the waist.
So that's a misdemeanor,
right?

432
00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:40.300
She then hurled a laptop glass and jam jarred him during the attack on the 30th

433
00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:42.681
of September last year,

434
00:25:42.681 --> 00:25:46.040
the quarter she was in court to hear the judge's comments.

435
00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:51.200
The court was told that Christ's church would allow her to return in October

436
00:25:51.201 --> 00:25:56.201
because she is that bright and has had articles published in medical journals.

437
00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:00.650
Do.
Do you realize that if this is true,
how fucked up this is

438
00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:03.100
that then they have the,

439
00:26:03.101 --> 00:26:07.310
the trap car that they drive down to impoverished areas and they leave it on

440
00:26:07.311 --> 00:26:09.230
with the keys in it and the door open.

441
00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:11.900
Why don't you fucking help somebody out down there?

442
00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:16.610
You gotta be white as a ghost going to fucking Oxford and they know they're

443
00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:19.670
going to make a bunch of money off your given a prescription drug someday.

444
00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:25.490
Wow.
All right.
Anyways,
Woodward will be sentenced on the

445
00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:27.410
25th of September.

446
00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:31.730
She was given a restraining order and told to stay drug free and not to Raya

447
00:26:31.731 --> 00:26:33.320
friend.
Hey,
if you don't mind,

448
00:26:33.321 --> 00:26:38.180
could you stay away from the person you stabbed and lay off the fucking pills or

449
00:26:38.181 --> 00:26:41.150
whatever the hell he said she had taken a spoken for.
Christchurch said,

450
00:26:41.151 --> 00:26:45.750
I'm afraid that Christ's church does not comment on the circumstances of

451
00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:49.590
individual students.
I'm a little confused if that was a,
uh,

452
00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:52.140
I would think that that would make it to real court.
Not just,

453
00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:53.680
<v 3>okay,</v>

454
00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:58.210
<v 1>she's a little thing to fucking Luna ticket,
but she's an animal in the rack.
Huh.</v>

455
00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:01.390
Um,
yeah,
I mean that's par for the course.
I mean,

456
00:27:01.391 --> 00:27:04.120
women do not pay the same fucking price.
You know,

457
00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:07.810
white guys get away with shit that black guys did.
It's all fucking,

458
00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:11.020
there's all different.
Before you do the crime,

459
00:27:11.021 --> 00:27:14.590
you really should just do the math and be like,
what am I?

460
00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:17.980
Oh,
what's up sweetheart?

461
00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:23.710
She's coming in here and he,
I can't,
I can't,
I can't be funny without cursing.

462
00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:28.360
You can't bring my lovely daughter,
my daughter in there,
Mike.

463
00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:33.700
Um,
am I watching here now?
Is that what's going on?
No,

464
00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:36.100
<v 3>I coming out.</v>

465
00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:41.020
<v 1>Oh,
you're coming to hang out.
Oh,
you want to be on the podcast?
Me?
Hey,</v>

466
00:27:41.021 --> 00:27:43.510
listen to this shit.
Some woman punched,

467
00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:48.540
stabbed in through a laptop through a window and a drug and alcohol fueled rage.

468
00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:53.470
And they gave her a suspended sentence because of her extraordinary talent in

469
00:27:53.471 --> 00:27:57.130
the medical,
or pretend it could damage your career in the future.

470
00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:01.600
She's stabbed the laptop.
No,
she stabbed her boyfriend and the leg.
Oh,

471
00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:05.080
get over here with a bread knife.
It was a bread knife.
You know what the fuck?

472
00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:08.770
You can't go around stabbing people even as a bread knife.

473
00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:12.400
Nia Renee Hill.
You know you want to make a bumper sticker.
You know what?

474
00:28:12.401 --> 00:28:15.190
That's good.
You can't go around stabbing people.
That's right.

475
00:28:15.191 --> 00:28:18.280
You can't go around stabbing people even if it's with a butter knife.

476
00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:22.030
So what is it?
They let her off?
Why?
I'll show you what it is.

477
00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:27.400
That's what it is near because she is white.
Yeah.
It goes to Oxford.
Yeah.

478
00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:31.750
Okay.
We could damage your career.
Oh,
go fuck yourself.

479
00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:38.380
Whether a little other little,
uh,
little blondie white girl and a moto jacket.

480
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:40.590
<v 3>Mm hmm.</v>

481
00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:44.410
<v 1>That says in is sitting in this world.
Yeah,
exactly.
Okay.</v>

482
00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:46.090
And when she actually killed somebody,

483
00:28:46.091 --> 00:28:49.600
next time we'll see you can't kill some of the butter knife show use.

484
00:28:49.601 --> 00:28:52.420
I show you this fucking steak knife next.
She's crazy.

485
00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:55.570
Is a butter knife for gateway to a steak knife?
I believe so.

486
00:28:55.571 --> 00:28:57.330
I believe if you're willing to pick up a butter knife,

487
00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:58.840
you're willing to pick up just about anything.

488
00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:04.570
You conclude your case.
Yeah.
Can I,

489
00:29:04.571 --> 00:29:06.970
can I hear your closing arguments for this white lady?

490
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.850
If you were talking to the jury.
All right,
you were in England.

491
00:29:09.851 --> 00:29:12.850
See wearing a powdered wig so it's even more creepily white for you.
Go ahead.

492
00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:13.300
I have,

493
00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:16.300
I have to wear the part I think everybody has to wear when over there they're

494
00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:20.650
begging to dress up over there.
I'm a king.
I'm a queen.
Who won the Dutches.

495
00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:27.760
Okay,
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I know that.
What's her name?

496
00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:31.210
Uh,
Levenia.

497
00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:35.950
I know Luvenia Luvenia Woodward looks innocent,

498
00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:40.810
but you're staring into the eyes of a psychopathic would be,

499
00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:47.600
that's all I got,
man.
I thought you were going to trash her mice wispy way.

500
00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:50.260
Few little white bitch.
Yeah,
he break.

501
00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:55.860
If I tried to hand her a nail file from an airline mechanic to complete with,

502
00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:58.960
uh,
to compete with cheapo airlines like southwest or jet blue,

503
00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:01.330
the majors need to oversell seats.

504
00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:05.080
In the case of passenger misses their flight.

505
00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:09.790
When passengers Miss Flights,
they essentially buy two seats for one,

506
00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:13.240
the one they missed and the one the airline rebook them on.

507
00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:15.910
They do this to maximize revenue per flight.

508
00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:19.450
I'm against what United did because they could have paid someone 1 million for

509
00:30:19.451 --> 00:30:23.230
this seat and still not lost as much as they did.
Unfortunately,

510
00:30:23.231 --> 00:30:27.830
entitled people want to pay for an Uber and sit first class.

511
00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:33.340
Uh,
it's hard to balance enough profit to operate in eight three 21 cross country

512
00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:38.400
keep prices low and still try to run the airline like it did in the 70s.

513
00:30:38.501 --> 00:30:43.300
Flying isn't as prestigious as it used to be and everyone is looking for a way

514
00:30:43.301 --> 00:30:45.610
to save a buck.
Love the show.
Go Fuck Yourself.
All right,

515
00:30:45.611 --> 00:30:50.410
so evidently passengers are also,
um,
to blame.
Well,

516
00:30:50.411 --> 00:30:55.360
let me ask,
well,
what was going on in the 70s that isn't going on now?

517
00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:58.840
Is there a way more people flying?
Did you guys go after bottom feeders?

518
00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:01.780
So you have more airplanes so you have more overhead?

519
00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:06.490
I don't understand why it was so proceeds prestigious back in the Ron Burgundy

520
00:31:06.491 --> 00:31:11.491
days and they treated your way better and now they just jam everybody,

521
00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:12.393
you know,

522
00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:16.300
in the back of the plane and try to put the seats close together so they can get

523
00:31:16.301 --> 00:31:19.060
more.
Rose.
Did you say Ron?
Burgundy.
Yeah.

524
00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:24.580
That's not a real person.
No,
but that the era was like in the 70s.

525
00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:29.230
Okay.
The Ron Burgundy Seventies.
What's the matter with that?

526
00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:33.910
That's the matter with that man.
Um,
I would say,
uh,
I want it.
Why is that?
I,

527
00:31:33.911 --> 00:31:36.400
this is really interesting to hear from people who actually work in the field.

528
00:31:36.401 --> 00:31:38.830
Like what happened?
Um,

529
00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:43.750
what happened to the price of fueled go up so high.
I don't get it.

530
00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:45.520
Why won't they just raise ticket prices?

531
00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:48.250
Because on the average person couldn't afford it.
Well,
good.

532
00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:52.790
Then get on the f out of there,
right?
Like,
well,

533
00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:58.090
sorry,
I,
I don't know why I came in here.
I'm really kind of checked out.

534
00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:01.040
All right.
Yeah.
Well you've got,
we've got,

535
00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:03.490
you've been dealing with the kid all day.
Hoof puked on me.

536
00:32:03.491 --> 00:32:05.530
Right before I did this,
she didn't puke.

537
00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:08.500
It was spin up and it was just a little bit,

538
00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:11.230
you act like you're witnessing someone getting executed in front of you.

539
00:32:11.231 --> 00:32:14.740
Every time she spits up,
you're like,
Jesus Christ.
Oh my God.
Like,

540
00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:15.670
oh that humanity.

541
00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:21.340
I was sitting there and she was smiling and out of nowhere she went and just

542
00:32:21.341 --> 00:32:23.140
fucking all came out and it's all warm.

543
00:32:23.141 --> 00:32:27.760
It's like somebody poured clam chowder on me and I was laying down.

544
00:32:27.761 --> 00:32:32.050
So one on my shirt,
my belt,
my pants,
and it's just like,
yeah,

545
00:32:32.051 --> 00:32:34.330
I have to guide the normal reaction to somebody puking on you,

546
00:32:34.331 --> 00:32:36.310
no matter how cute they are.

547
00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:42.860
How cute you all right.
Let me,
let me wait.
Wait,
what did you do?
What'd you do?

548
00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:45.800
Christ.
What did you

549
00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:04.640
all right.
I hope that wasn't a bunch of silence here.
Maybe it was,

550
00:33:04.641 --> 00:33:06.500
maybe it wasn't.
I don't know.
Um,

551
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:11.690
I see someone wrote you something about an article that I read.
Oh,

552
00:33:11.691 --> 00:33:15.170
my family's slaves article.
Yeah.
Yeah.

553
00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:18.350
That was an intense article.
I want to,
what does this person say?

554
00:33:18.351 --> 00:33:21.470
Can you read the question?
Yeah,
that's what I was going to do.

555
00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:25.970
Can you not sit on the recorder again?
All right.
My family slaves article.
Hey,

556
00:33:25.971 --> 00:33:30.640
Bilbo Baggins,
longtime listener.
First Time emailer.

557
00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:36.350
Um,
I read an article written by Alex [inaudible].
He's dead now.
Okay.

558
00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:37.701
That shocked me,

559
00:33:37.701 --> 00:33:41.000
but didn't really necessarily surprise me and I love your cultural,

560
00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:45.560
your cultural perspective on it.
Oh my God,
this is so fucking long.

561
00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:53.000
And this article,
this guy talks about his family owned a slave for 50 years.

562
00:33:53.001 --> 00:33:55.010
Even after immigrating to America,

563
00:33:55.011 --> 00:33:58.070
they smuggled her with them and all that.

564
00:33:58.071 --> 00:34:00.050
They treated her like shit and never paying her,

565
00:34:00.051 --> 00:34:02.330
forcing her to sleep on top of laundry.

566
00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:05.930
I imagine it's the dirty laundry.

567
00:34:05.931 --> 00:34:10.400
Why would you want to have somebody in constantly beating her for the tiniest of

568
00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:11.300
errors?

569
00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:16.210
Only when the writer grew up with an American identity that he realized what

570
00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:18.170
they were doing to the poor woman wasn't right.

571
00:34:18.171 --> 00:34:21.920
Did he and his sibling confront their parents over this,
hey mom,

572
00:34:21.921 --> 00:34:25.550
you know you've been paying this ladies sleeps on our clothes.

573
00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:28.520
Gordy,
my teacher,
that's not right.

574
00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:32.840
As a guy of Chinese descent raised in the Americas race in America,

575
00:34:32.841 --> 00:34:36.620
I've witnessed poor people like this firsthand.
Growing up,

576
00:34:36.621 --> 00:34:39.590
visiting family back in Hong Kong,
I'd see my cousin,

577
00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:43.670
they're millennials by the way,
being tended to by a young Filipino girl,

578
00:34:43.671 --> 00:34:47.780
no older than her twenties I never thought much of this back then.
Looking back,

579
00:34:47.781 --> 00:34:49.400
it seems pretty fucked up.

580
00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:52.940
I asked my mother about these kinds of people and she simply said,

581
00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:56.360
that's just the way things are.
These girls are poor.

582
00:34:56.361 --> 00:34:59.270
They need to support their family and that's the only kind of shitty employment

583
00:34:59.271 --> 00:35:00.104
that they can get.

584
00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:05.150
Once my grandfather took me past city hall in Hong Kong on a Sunday and I saw

585
00:35:05.151 --> 00:35:08.450
hundreds of young Filipino girls just sitting on the ground doing absolutely

586
00:35:08.451 --> 00:35:10.910
nothing.
I asked him,
what was that all about?

587
00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:14.330
He said that Sunday was the day off and they had nothing better to do than

588
00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:18.020
loiter.
They sent all their money back home to their families,

589
00:35:18.021 --> 00:35:21.200
so it's not like they could shop or go to a restaurant or anything.

590
00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:23.480
They ate and slept with their employers.

591
00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:28.300
I never seen my grandfather turned his nose up at a group of people like that

592
00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:29.660
ever before.

593
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:33.230
My grandfather whose parents were murdered by the Japanese during World War II.

594
00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:37.320
Oh Wow.
Yeah.
I've read about that shit.
The rape and Nan King,
every that shit,

595
00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:43.020
they fucking Japanese went off and had to walk to the orphanage after finding

596
00:35:43.021 --> 00:35:46.380
out Jesus Christ.
I've had an easy life.
One of the kindest,

597
00:35:46.381 --> 00:35:50.940
most empathetic old farts I know.
Loved randomly hugging white people.

598
00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:54.510
He called them hellos because that's what they'd say to him.

599
00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:58.530
One of these people out.
Uh,
here's the article.

600
00:35:58.531 --> 00:36:03.300
I'm just curious what someone like you raised with purely Western centric

601
00:36:03.301 --> 00:36:06.690
ideologies would say about something like this at,
well,
I mean,

602
00:36:06.691 --> 00:36:10.160
this country was kind of built on that.
Yeah.
So,
um,

603
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:13.170
I think it was built on flavor.
Yeah.
I can't really step away to,
well,

604
00:36:13.171 --> 00:36:17.400
we don't do it anymore.
Um,
but uh,
yeah,

605
00:36:17.401 --> 00:36:19.040
obviously I think it's,
it's all right.

606
00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:23.200
<v 4>I mean,
not now,
but you should read the article.
It's,
it's pretty powerful,</v>

607
00:36:23.350 --> 00:36:28.350
that whole thing because this woman was given to his mother by her father and

608
00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:31.600
they're Filipino and that's just,
yeah,
they were just like,
here,

609
00:36:31.601 --> 00:36:33.100
this person is going to take care of you.

610
00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:38.310
So she kept this woman throughout her life and it became her children's care

611
00:36:39.761 --> 00:36:42.040
keeper.
Yeah.
Cause she didn't want to do any fucking work.

612
00:36:42.041 --> 00:36:43.750
And then she moved to America and be like,
Oh my God,

613
00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:47.230
I've got to take these kids out for a Sunday.
No,
no.
That's again,

614
00:36:47.231 --> 00:36:48.190
that's just like the culture,

615
00:36:48.191 --> 00:36:51.760
like this person is your nanny and now like you inherit them or something like

616
00:36:51.761 --> 00:36:55.450
that.
So it wasn't even as if she had,
it's this part of their tradition.

617
00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:56.740
I have to be not like all of that.

618
00:36:56.741 --> 00:37:00.430
This guy grew up and then he realized that this woman wasn't getting paid and

619
00:37:00.431 --> 00:37:03.070
all this other stuff and he didn't realize it until it dawned on him.

620
00:37:03.071 --> 00:37:04.360
Like she is a sleigh.

621
00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:08.110
And so he tried to make things better for her in her later life after his

622
00:37:08.111 --> 00:37:13.090
parents died and all this kind of stuff.
But backrub yeah,
no,

623
00:37:13.091 --> 00:37:18.040
but by that time she,
you know,
didn't know any other life,
so she didn't really,

624
00:37:18.041 --> 00:37:19.060
she wasn't like,
yeah,

625
00:37:19.061 --> 00:37:22.060
I've been waiting to go shopping at the mall like this whole time.
Right.

626
00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:25.820
<v 1>This is so fucking sad.
That's like when it gets very,
like Dubai,
Dubai,</v>

627
00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:29.130
they tell all those people in east of there that,
hey man,

628
00:37:29.370 --> 00:37:31.440
c'mon here and help us build all these beautiful buildings.

629
00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:33.060
You make all this money,
you'll get out of poverty.

630
00:37:33.061 --> 00:37:36.420
Then they get them there and then they'd take confiscate their passports and

631
00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:41.370
that's just slave labor that builds those fucking places.
And then they,
uh,

632
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:44.460
like the number one,
the only way to get out of it is they like commit suicide.

633
00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:48.750
Right.
It's fucking brutal.
Then you watch your shows in the big balloon,

634
00:37:48.751 --> 00:37:52.920
tinted whores go over there to buy a fucking bag.
Not a fan.

635
00:37:52.921 --> 00:37:55.560
Not a fan of Dubai.
Not a fan of Dubai.

636
00:37:55.770 --> 00:38:00.000
Why can't they be sinless like the United States of America?

637
00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:03.070
Uh,
no.
That's all horribly depressing.
And,
uh,

638
00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:05.490
I don't know what to tell you about that as far as like,

639
00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:09.890
I don't know how you do that to somebody.
There you go in there,

640
00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:13.160
goes to comedy right out the window.
Um,

641
00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:17.150
<v 4>I wonder why he,
I'm just curious of why this person asks.
Like,</v>

642
00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:20.360
I'm curious what someone like you raised with a purely Western centric

643
00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:23.060
ideologies would say about something like this.
Again,
it's like,

644
00:38:23.061 --> 00:38:25.740
are you forgetting that this is America?
Those built,

645
00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:27.110
<v 1>yeah,
but I didn't grow up with that.</v>

646
00:38:27.111 --> 00:38:29.120
So what he wants to do is get an outside perspective.

647
00:38:29.121 --> 00:38:33.020
It's actually an intelligent thing that you've been like,
Hey,
I'm not from here.

648
00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:36.160
I grew up here,
but you know,
I also have connections,
you know,
back there.

649
00:38:36.161 --> 00:38:40.390
So what do you think about this?
Blah,
blah,
blah.
You know what I think,
uh,

650
00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:45.190
I think it's a terrible,
I'm going to go on and say that.
That's fucking terrible.

651
00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:48.590
I have so much more shit to Renia.

652
00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:51.430
You have to get out of here cause you're just gonna.
You're gonna prolong it.
Oh,

653
00:38:51.431 --> 00:38:55.550
I thought you were only doing half an hour.
All right.
Hold on over here.
Sorry.

654
00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:58.330
All right.
Real quick.
Let's let me,
let me read this.
Cool cars.
Hey,

655
00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:01.450
Billy Bruin balls.
I'm a huge fan all you are 18 and under.

656
00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:05.770
Excited that you've become an f one in Moto GP Fan.
I follow both of your,

657
00:39:05.771 --> 00:39:07.480
these incredible sports since the mid eighties.

658
00:39:07.481 --> 00:39:10.510
If you haven't already seen the documentary,
uh,
center or

659
00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:14.020
Siena Johns Santa isn't.
I saw that.
I actually did watch,

660
00:39:14.021 --> 00:39:15.400
I don't know to pronounce his name.
Don't you should.

661
00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:19.000
It does a fantastic job of explaining the myth around the great formula one

662
00:39:19.001 --> 00:39:23.890
driver and his intense rivalry with Mclaren teammate Alan Prost.
Uh,

663
00:39:23.891 --> 00:39:25.390
I know you're always looking for cool website.

664
00:39:25.391 --> 00:39:29.830
Here's a link to a really cool auto auction website and it's a bring a

665
00:39:29.831 --> 00:39:33.490
trailer.com.
I'll check that out.
All right,
here we go.

666
00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:38.580
Here's some fucking advertisement before we play a little music and then play a

667
00:39:39.131 --> 00:39:42.040
greatest hits thing.
All right.
Five,

668
00:39:42.041 --> 00:39:46.750
four mentioned the importance of feeling good in your clothes.

669
00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:51.280
All my God,
when I walk around in jeans,
I want my fucking legs to feel great.

670
00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:52.391
Looking good.

671
00:39:52.391 --> 00:39:57.010
Doesn't need to cost a fortune five four club is revolutionizing the way men

672
00:39:57.650 --> 00:40:01.960
shop,
not the ladies.
The way the men do it at five four club,

673
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:06.760
they found a way to make men under five foot four looks stylish to tall women.

674
00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:08.800
No.
At five four club,

675
00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:12.370
they found a way to make great looking clothes affordable for everyone else.

676
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:13.060
Oh Jesus.

677
00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:16.210
This is person servant going to make them sleeping on top of the clothes before

678
00:40:16.211 --> 00:40:18.550
they sewn together.
Five four club.

679
00:40:18.551 --> 00:40:21.490
Also understand that your time is extremely valuable.

680
00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:26.260
Why wasted at the mall or wandering around in the stores?
Dude,
I swear to God,

681
00:40:26.261 --> 00:40:28.420
strip malls and malls.
Do you think in the future,
in near,

682
00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:30.300
do you think they're going to exist anymore?

683
00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:33.460
If more and more companies like this,
there's going to be no post office.

684
00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:37.510
You won't go to the fucking mall.
Everything's going to be a luxury high rise,

685
00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:42.430
right?
With indentured servants milling around out front during the Sunday,

686
00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:43.240
I dunno,

687
00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:47.320
each month they send you a curated box of two to three items that are handpicked

688
00:40:47.321 --> 00:40:49.930
to match the current season in your style.

692
00:41:02.141 --> 00:41:02.980
men every month.

693
00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:08.160
Chris Paul and Mark Walberg use five four club in five.

694
00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:12.890

vice and instyle among other publications.
Nia,

695
00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:17.750
a little look over there.
He didn't believe them.
Absolutely.
Well,

696
00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:19.410
I'm on the way that my Oscars,
you know,

697
00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:22.900
someday I'm going to call the five four club.
They know what they're doing,

698
00:41:22.901 --> 00:41:24.340
so if you don't,
that's okay.

699
00:41:24.341 --> 00:41:28.090
Five four club will help you build your wardrobe one month at a time.

700
00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:32.650
Oh,
Bato Popo,

Me.

701
00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:38.440
Everyone needs a slave Badu due to on me undies work until they in the grave.

702
00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:44.300
Your balls field nice and soft because they polished in with the underwear they

703
00:41:44.301 --> 00:41:47.480
made and that's fucking evil.
Bottom white.

704
00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:51.630
It's part of my id and a,
I'm really sorry.
All right,
me on.

705
00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:55.040
Hey Bill,

706
00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:59.780
what do you think about lifelong slavery and somebody's dreams being crushed and

I'll see you on Monday.
Let's read some of the,
uh,

823
00:49:27.651 --> 00:49:31.160
the questions here for this week.
Oh,
we got an update.

824
00:49:31.161 --> 00:49:33.800
I love when there's an update.
I remember last week,
the,
uh,

825
00:49:33.801 --> 00:49:38.540
the granny fucking war.
Remember that story?

826
00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:42.370
All right.
Here we got an update.
Hey,
they're all Billy fucking water.

827
00:49:43.250 --> 00:49:48.230
I got an update for you on this one.
Uh,
the story has good news and bad news.

828
00:49:48.231 --> 00:49:50.750
All right,
so last,
last week,
for those of you who didn't listen,

829
00:49:50.751 --> 00:49:54.920
I'll give you a little recap.
There was some kid,
uh,
you know,
he was,

830
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:58.580
he's basically,
he's engaged.
He's getting married in six weeks,

831
00:49:58.581 --> 00:50:02.720
so he's over his fiance's house as his future in laws house,

832
00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:06.050
her fucking parents.
That's all I'm trying to say.
Right.

833
00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:10.760
So they're playing some card game and evidently they're down to the final hand

834
00:50:10.761 --> 00:50:15.380
and he has,
uh,
the cards called granny water.

835
00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:17.900
I don't know what the game is or whatever.

836
00:50:17.901 --> 00:50:20.450
Some people send me pictures of the car at the game does exist,

837
00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:24.950
but it's a really high point card or whatever.
And he was laying down,

838
00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:28.970
ah,
fuck,
I'm Yon.
And sorry was laying down his card last.

839
00:50:30.170 --> 00:50:33.500
I basically,
when he laid it down,
he was going to do the old fucking right there.

840
00:50:33.501 --> 00:50:35.720
Fred.
I won the game and uh,

841
00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:38.480
he had the granny water card and I guess in the end of the game is probably,

842
00:50:38.590 --> 00:50:41.210
you get it,
you hold onto it and you played at a crucial point.

843
00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:44.090
So everybody's sitting there as everybody's laying the cards down,

844
00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:46.280
waiting to see who's going to fucking lay it down.

845
00:50:46.281 --> 00:50:51.020
So this kid fucking his finally his turn,
he lays it down to be like,
you know,

846
00:50:51.021 --> 00:50:53.090
like hitting the last second three.
I just won.

847
00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:56.030
And because he listens to the podcast and set of saying,

848
00:50:56.031 --> 00:51:00.020
I got the granny water card.
He goes,
he goes,
look,
he goes,

849
00:51:00.021 --> 00:51:03.830
it's all fucking grant now.
He goes,
it's granny fucking war.

850
00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:09.020
And just screamed it
to his in laws.

851
00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:14.090
Okay,
who never heard this guy curse before and do not listen to this podcast.

852
00:51:14.091 --> 00:51:18.560
So they just stared at him like,
what?
What was that?

853
00:51:18.561 --> 00:51:20.090
What is my daughter marrying?

854
00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:22.880
Like he just completely screwed the whole fucking thing up.

855
00:51:22.881 --> 00:51:26.360
So he's asking me for advice.
Should he bring it up?
Shitting up,
bring it up.

856
00:51:26.361 --> 00:51:28.040
All right,
now you guys are caught up.
Here you go.

857
00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:30.860
He says the story has good news and bad news.

858
00:51:32.090 --> 00:51:36.770
The good news is my fiance's parents were super cool about the whole thing.

859
00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:39.180
Um,

860
00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:44.180
I bit the bullet and waited until we went over for game night again last night.

861
00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:49.610
I apologized of course,
and they said,
they initially just thought,

862
00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:52.880
why are y'all really like this?
Fuck?

863
00:51:53.090 --> 00:51:56.150
They initially thought it was really odd for me to yell like that without

864
00:51:56.151 --> 00:52:00.860
knowing,
without them knowing the context.
The,
once it was explained,

865
00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:06.020
my fiance texted them about it.
It was no big deal.
It was a huge relief.

866
00:52:06.021 --> 00:52:10.850
We played the game again and every time someone played that card,

867
00:52:10.851 --> 00:52:14.990
they did the whole granny water thing minus the fucking in the middle.

868
00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:20.630
Okay,
cool.
He goes to,
my embarrassment will be immortalized.
Uh,

869
00:52:20.631 --> 00:52:24.530
the bad news is that I mentioned that you read the letter on the podcast.

870
00:52:24.590 --> 00:52:26.300
Oh No.

871
00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:27.810
<v 5>Okay.</v>

872
00:52:27.810 --> 00:52:29.310
<v 1>You know what?
You're one of those guys.</v>

873
00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:33.000
Do you just like you just like stepping in shit.
He goes naturally.

874
00:52:33.001 --> 00:52:34.320
They wanted to listen to it.

875
00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:38.730
I thought it wasn't a big deal because they lived through the story and your

876
00:52:38.731 --> 00:52:40.530
commentary was hilarious.

877
00:52:40.770 --> 00:52:44.910
I warn them about the explicit nature of your podcasts and that there were

878
00:52:44.911 --> 00:52:46.440
plenty of fucks throughout.

879
00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:51.390
The fact that he did the grantee water thing before it was even brought up,

880
00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:55.770
uh,
was perfect.
Everyone thought the story was hilarious.

881
00:52:55.800 --> 00:53:00.780
That is until the p s
uh,

882
00:53:00.781 --> 00:53:05.400
if you recall,
I may or may have not called Hillary Clinton a comment.

883
00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:11.550
Uh,
Jesus.
That's right.
You did.
He goes,
yeah,
I know.
I'm a dumb ass bill.

884
00:53:11.551 --> 00:53:16.290
My fiance just turned to me and said,
did you write that?
Uh,

885
00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:19.500
he said,
my fiance turned to me and said,

886
00:53:19.501 --> 00:53:24.480
did you write that with that look on her face?
I knew I was fucked,

887
00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:28.890
so I did the only thing I could,
I said,
oh,

888
00:53:28.891 --> 00:53:33.210
sorry about that.
I didn't write it.
Bill's email screener guy did.

889
00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:38.760
Andrew did.
He picks the emails each week.
Then writes the little opening line,

890
00:53:39.450 --> 00:53:43.740
pun and then sometimes throws in a ps to make them more entertaining.

891
00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:47.280
When or why would you write this?
Cause if they listen to this,
you're fucked.

892
00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:50.160
Do you know what dude,
I have no sympathy for us.
Here we go.
He goes,

893
00:53:50.161 --> 00:53:50.790
they bought it.

894
00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:54.210
So he just listened to the rest and we're laughing again by the end.

895
00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:56.940
So I through Andrew onto the bus on that one.

896
00:53:57.180 --> 00:54:01.530
I'm going to repeat my only good move from the last story and just shut the fuck

897
00:54:01.531 --> 00:54:04.650
up about it forever in the end.
All is well.

898
00:54:04.651 --> 00:54:08.310
Thanks for reading it on the podcast.
It seemed to help smooth it over.

899
00:54:08.311 --> 00:54:11.580
No worries.
Just tell him not to listen to this one.
He goes,
by the way,

900
00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:14.453
um,

901
00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:17.910
I just bought tickets to your show and I'm not going to say where the show is in

902
00:54:17.911 --> 00:54:19.860
case anybody's figuring out who the fuck this is.

903
00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:25.340
It's the week after my wedding and my fiance slash wife by that point is coming

904
00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:30.100
too.
I'd love to meet you in person.
Thanks.
And Go fuck yourself.
Uh,

905
00:54:30.310 --> 00:54:31.440
all right.
Well yeah,

906
00:54:32.370 --> 00:54:35.430
I'll be hanging out after Iowa.

907
00:54:36.450 --> 00:54:41.040
Just scream out.
Oh,
I just said where it was.
Oh,
well you're fucked.

908
00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:45.530
Granny water screaming out and fucking say Allodia.
All right,

909
00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:46.920
now everybody's going to do that there.

910
00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:50.580
<v 6>Hey,
what's up?
This is bill bar for some reason,
uh,</v>

911
00:54:50.581 --> 00:54:55.500
the podcasts that I did on Memorial Day,
uh,

912
00:54:55.530 --> 00:54:57.570
I dunno,
it hasn't been able to upload.

913
00:54:57.571 --> 00:55:01.200
So now what I've done is I've turned it into two parts because I think it's
been,

914
00:55:01.470 --> 00:55:02.520
I think it was too long.

915
00:55:02.521 --> 00:55:07.521
So here is part one of the 54 minute Memorial Day,

916
00:55:07.621 --> 00:55:12.570
Monday morning podcast at the end of this one.
You'll listen to part two,

917
00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:14.430
Huh?
Yeah.

918
00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:17.830
<v 7>Hey,
what's going on?</v>

919
00:55:17.831 --> 00:55:21.370
It's built bar and it is the Monday morning podcast for Monday.

920
00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:24.190
May 25th,

921
00:55:24.190 --> 00:55:28.670
2009 Happy Memorial Day to one and all.
Ah,
you like liked that.

922
00:55:28.671 --> 00:55:32.320
Is that one of the most happiest Kris kringle ways I've ever started a fucking

923
00:55:32.321 --> 00:55:36.880
podcast.
Yeah.
Happy Memorial Day at thank you to all the,
uh,

924
00:55:36.910 --> 00:55:41.770
all the troops out there who are serving,
who have ever served.
Add A,

925
00:55:41.771 --> 00:55:45.460
yeah.
Get yourself a burger today or whatever the fuck you supposed to do on this

926
00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:47.320
holiday.
What are you supposed to do?
Are we supposed to go to a parade?

927
00:55:47.970 --> 00:55:52.070
Isn't that what you're supposed to do?
You know,
I'm not going to a parade.

928
00:55:53.260 --> 00:55:57.950
I uh,
I'm not big on parades.
I don't like them.

929
00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:03.830
I find them boring once I've seen the first band,
I get it.

930
00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:07.380
All right.
You're all basically playing the same song.

931
00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:09.150
It all sounds like the same song.

932
00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:13.620
And I hate when a big fucking college band starts playing top 40 hits.

933
00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:18.050
Like it's going to sound good.
You know,
like,
oh,

934
00:56:18.051 --> 00:56:20.270
that's the way Beyonce should have done that song.

935
00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:25.330
She should've had 58 guys on a Tuba and 26 guys on trumpets.

936
00:56:27.090 --> 00:56:30.320
I'll play in that fucking,
uh,
if you like it there,

937
00:56:30.450 --> 00:56:35.200
you Barry Blair to vague on it with the fucking trauma,
you know,

938
00:56:35.310 --> 00:56:40.310
28 fucking guys doing that shit and then you're all fucking walking with the

939
00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:44.940
same feet.
Hey,
we're all taking a left at the same time.
Ah,

940
00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:49.550
go fuck yourselves.
You know,
I just liked the drum line.
That's all I like.

941
00:56:49.551 --> 00:56:54.310
Other than that,
you know,
parade music sucks.

942
00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:59.820
There's a couple of them.
Bam,
Bam,
ba Ba bum ba Ba ba bump ba bump

943
00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:01.920
<v 8>bet.
Eh,
Eh,
it,
they're happy</v>

944
00:57:02.910 --> 00:57:03.990
<v 7>fit bit,
but that's great.</v>

945
00:57:04.150 --> 00:57:07.260
Watch everybody prance around and their red jackets with the gold buttons.

946
00:57:07.261 --> 00:57:11.270
That's fine.
I'm all over that,
but that's it.
Once it's done.
All right,

947
00:57:11.271 --> 00:57:14.090
let's drink now let's fucking fire up the grill.

948
00:57:14.210 --> 00:57:16.130
I don't need to see another one of those.

949
00:57:17.050 --> 00:57:18.970
<v 8>Where?
Pap Pap pap pap</v>

950
00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:22.960
pap pap pap pap pap about Jesus Christ.

951
00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:27.240
<v 7>How many more
coming on Derek's ladies and gentlemen,</v>

952
00:57:27.241 --> 00:57:31.200
please welcome the girls choir with their little twiddle sticks.

953
00:57:31.770 --> 00:57:33.270
Whatever the fuck you Bhutan's.

954
00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:40.000
<v 8>Yeah.
[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

955
00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:43.690
<v 7>Ooh,
ha ha.
You know,
just standing there.</v>

956
00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:48.930
My big forehead just burdened in the fucking Sun.
In what?

957
00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:51.930
In what comes in the end.
It's either Santa Claus or a fire engine.

958
00:57:52.770 --> 00:57:54.250
That's the end of the fucking party.

959
00:57:57.860 --> 00:58:02.640
Oh,
those firemen sitting on the truck fresh after banging a hooker,

960
00:58:02.700 --> 00:58:03.360
you know,

961
00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:07.920
are stealing the cash out to somebody buttoned down in a closet when there was a

962
00:58:07.921 --> 00:58:09.920
fire in the basement.
You know,

963
00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:13.970
I love talking shit about firemen now cause I don't respect him.

964
00:58:13.971 --> 00:58:18.470
I just love how they just have this fucking Dudley do,
right?
People love firemen.

965
00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:23.330
They hate cops.
They love firemen.
You know your house is on fire.
They show up,

966
00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:24.753
right?

967
00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:29.150
Your cat gets stuck in a tree who comes running down the street and a raincoat

968
00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:33.350
with a fucking ladder.
The goddamn firemen,
they get a call,

969
00:58:33.740 --> 00:58:37.290
you know,
did not like cops polishing off a donut.

970
00:58:37.610 --> 00:58:42.440
They stay fucking slide down that stripper pole and they get it on the big red

971
00:58:42.590 --> 00:58:44.690
for who the fuck doesn't like a fire engine.
You know,

972
00:58:44.691 --> 00:58:47.270
I saw a fire engine fucking yesterday.

973
00:58:47.270 --> 00:58:50.330
I was coming under the dog park with my dog and there was like three of them

974
00:58:50.331 --> 00:58:53.910
lined up and I guess they were doing some CPR core.

975
00:58:53.911 --> 00:58:56.010
I don't know what the fuck they would do when they had one of the firemen,

976
00:58:56.370 --> 00:59:00.060
you know he was,
he was strapped down to a Gurney.
This isn't some gay shit.

977
00:59:00.090 --> 00:59:03.720
They were like fun.
They will,
they will,
they will learn it.

978
00:59:03.721 --> 00:59:04.830
Some sort of procedure,

979
00:59:05.220 --> 00:59:08.580
probably how to move someone who has got a spinal cord injury or whatever,

980
00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:12.210
but they all the fire engines lined up and I got to admit there's something,

981
00:59:12.211 --> 00:59:16.240
there's a little kid and everybody you get near a fire engine is fucking great.

982
00:59:16.830 --> 00:59:21.070
Big Red fire engine with all that fucking chrome,
you know?
I mean,

983
00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:25.820
who as a kid didn't want to be that guy at the back of the fire engine driving

984
00:59:25.821 --> 00:59:28.070
the thing down the fucking street.
You know what I mean?

985
00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:31.670
That's what I'm going to do someday when I get super famous.

986
00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:35.090
That's the perk that I'm calling in is I'm going to be,

987
00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:39.650
I want to fucking drive that thing down the street.
You know,

988
00:59:39.651 --> 00:59:43.190
they take you on a straight away.
You realize how much those fucking trucks cost.

989
00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:48.020
Yeah.
Well,
I don't either.
I have no fucking idea how much they cost.

990
00:59:48.021 --> 00:59:52.280
They got to cost a lot.
Right?
You know,
dude,

991
00:59:52.281 --> 00:59:56.870
you got to figure a fucking Winnebago.
If you get a nice one,
cost you 150 grand.

992
00:59:56.871 --> 01:00:00.740
Now what have you had a Winnebago that could actually put out fires,
you know,

993
01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:04.070
or save someone with a spinal cord injury?
You know what I'm saying?
Like that,

994
01:00:04.071 --> 01:00:07.940
that would be,
uh,
that'd be at least 200 grand.
Right?
You know,

995
01:00:07.941 --> 01:00:09.740
I wonder if I can fucking Google that right now.

996
01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:14.450
You don't realize today if you click on f four,
you get an a on your computer.

997
01:00:15.390 --> 01:00:17.600
Uh,
at least on the Mac book,
you get the calculator,

998
01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:19.460
you get the weather for the week,

999
01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:24.230
you get a calendar and you get a clock.
You know,

1000
01:00:24.590 --> 01:00:27.710
I know that's basic computer shit.
That's not what I do here on the podcast.

1001
01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:30.920
You know what?
I'm not googling that shit out.
It's got to be a fireman.

1002
01:00:30.921 --> 01:00:34.850
A two who fucking,
uh,
listen to this podcast,
right.

1003
01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:37.880
And I'm on trash and cops,
by the way,
either I'm not,
I'm just saying no,

1004
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:41.630
everybody doesn't like cops.
Cause when cops show up,
you know,

1005
01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:46.400
he the just got beat down by your husband or you're getting a fucking speeding

1006
01:00:46.401 --> 01:00:49.940
ticket.
You know,
that's when cops show up.
You know,

1007
01:00:49.941 --> 01:00:53.000
firemen show up like a,
you know,
they,
they stick a ladder.

1008
01:00:53.690 --> 01:00:54.830
It's like very romantic.

1009
01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:58.820
They put a ladder up to your bedroom and they just take you away from it all.

1010
01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:06.800
You know what,
maybe I'll start that.
Let's,
let's start a,

1011
01:01:06.801 --> 01:01:10.100
a new segment on this podcast where you actually,

1012
01:01:10.670 --> 01:01:15.470
you gotta tell a bad story about a group of people that only gets good press,

1013
01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:19.910
like either fireman.
What about the troops?
You know,

1014
01:01:19.911 --> 01:01:24.170
straight at Greeno on Memorial Day,
straight across the board,
support the troops.

1015
01:01:24.171 --> 01:01:27.650
Do you support the troops,
support the troops?
You know,

1016
01:01:28.550 --> 01:01:32.090
because I'm such a Cunt,
I've actually broken down supporting the troops.

1017
01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:33.350
You know,
too.

1018
01:01:33.770 --> 01:01:36.650
I actually have so much free time that I actually sat there and I was like,

1019
01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:40.010
really?
I just have to straight across the board,
support the troops.

1020
01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:43.010
Every single one of them.
You know,
every single one,

1021
01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:48.100
like there's not one asshole in the navy that even his fellow fucking people in

1022
01:01:48.111 --> 01:01:50.300
the navy can't fucking stand.
You know,

1023
01:01:50.301 --> 01:01:54.530
there's some current right now on a fucking aircraft carrier who's just not

1024
01:01:54.531 --> 01:01:57.510
pulling his weight.
He's always fucking off any.

1025
01:01:57.910 --> 01:02:02.090
Nobody knows exactly when to fucking pop to attention.
When,
when some,

1026
01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:03.860
when some officer comes by,

1027
01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:08.090
you know there's not one douche bag in the navy that is other navy buddies

1028
01:02:08.091 --> 01:02:11.570
aren't thinking of just pushing overboard.
Give me a fucking break.
Okay,

1029
01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:17.140
so that I support the troops but not the Douche bags.

1030
01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:18.433
How about that?

1031
01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:22.200
I'm actually gonna make that into a bumper sticker and I'll just have a

1032
01:02:22.201 --> 01:02:26.070
camouflage background so no one will question it.
Well wait a little Millard,

1033
01:02:26.071 --> 01:02:29.010
break it down here.
Where are you guys saying he supports the truth?

1034
01:02:29.011 --> 01:02:30.450
We're not the Douche bags.

1035
01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:34.200
All guys are douchebags must believe the people who don't support the troops.

1036
01:02:34.290 --> 01:02:35.123
Now Dude,

1037
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:39.870
the Douche bags are the guys who are troops but happen to be douche bags.
Okay.

1038
01:02:40.110 --> 01:02:41.670
Let's not speak in absolutes here.

1039
01:02:43.110 --> 01:02:46.080
Why the fuck would I say shit like that on the Goddamn Memorial Day?

1040
01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:48.330
You know what,
I support all the troops,
even at Douche bags today,

1041
01:02:48.331 --> 01:02:51.720
but on any other day,
I don't.
I don't.
I,
you know,
I live in,

1042
01:02:51.721 --> 01:02:55.200
I live in the real world.
Here am or not.
I don't live in a real world.
Look at me.

1043
01:02:55.201 --> 01:02:58.770
I'm fucking sitting here with an orange microphone talking shit to fucking

1044
01:02:58.830 --> 01:03:03.600
myself.
I'm a realist.
Okay.

1045
01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:08.790
You know what I mean?
Look at and look at all,
what's his face there,

1046
01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:14.070
George Bush.
You know what I mean?
I bet people didn't think he was a Douche bag.

1047
01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:18.900
I bet he was a hot shit when he was in the fucking national guard.
You know,

1048
01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:22.860
taking weekends off when he's supposed to be there and probably took you out on

1049
01:03:22.861 --> 01:03:25.890
his boat.
Now,
I didn't have a boat.
He lived in Texas.

1050
01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:30.480
Probably had a horse or some shit.
Isn't it amazing how that,
that guy just,

1051
01:03:30.481 --> 01:03:34.290
he just fucking disappeared.
You know,
I didn't,

1052
01:03:34.291 --> 01:03:36.180
I didn't agree with George Bush's policies,

1053
01:03:36.181 --> 01:03:39.270
but there was just something about that guy that I just really fucking related

1054
01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:40.890
to.
You know what I mean?

1055
01:03:42.030 --> 01:03:45.060
Like if I s w if I stopped being president,

1056
01:03:45.061 --> 01:03:49.290
the amount of stress that has to be involved with that fucking job,

1057
01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:54.000
I gotta tell you something,
Dude,
today that job was over.
I,

1058
01:03:54.001 --> 01:03:56.760
that's that.
Yeah,
I'd be like him.
You'd never see me again,

1059
01:03:57.510 --> 01:04:02.190
or the very least I would take like a
God,
I,

1060
01:04:02.430 --> 01:04:07.200
you'd have to,
you'd have to take at least five fucking years off.
I know.

1061
01:04:07.250 --> 01:04:09.990
If they told stories about how much that job ages you,

1062
01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:14.160
and if you don't believe it,
look at like younger pictures of George Bush.

1063
01:04:14.161 --> 01:04:18.750
Like how quickly you go.
Gray.
Same thing happen to,
uh,
to Bill Clinton.

1064
01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:22.990
You know?
Or maybe they just stop using Grecian formula because they,

1065
01:04:22.991 --> 01:04:24.270
they got elected and I'm like,
well,

1066
01:04:24.271 --> 01:04:27.240
I don't have to do this fucking beauty parlors shit.
Anyways,

1067
01:04:27.241 --> 01:04:30.360
I got the fucking job.
You know,

1068
01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:33.990
I'm taking my dick out,
bringing in an intern.

1069
01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:39.240
One of the easiest impressions ever.
Build a little Bill Clinton for you.

1070
01:04:39.370 --> 01:04:43.300
You like that.
And then in the end of this,
I'll do a Vinnie Barbarino.
Actually,

1071
01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:45.120
no,
let's,
one of the things that I wish I knew how to do,

1072
01:04:45.121 --> 01:04:48.990
I wish I knew how to do a impressions.
I wish,
I wish I could do it.

1073
01:04:48.991 --> 01:04:52.260
I can more sort of imitate people who I hang out with,

1074
01:04:52.261 --> 01:04:55.710
but I can't imitate famous people.

1075
01:04:55.970 --> 01:04:58.920
And unless somebody famous already does the impression,

1076
01:04:59.070 --> 01:05:03.720
then I can do an impression of their impression.
That's basically it.
You know,

1077
01:05:03.721 --> 01:05:08.430
that's,
that's I'm sort of a hacky impression guy.
And a,

1078
01:05:08.431 --> 01:05:10.590
and then if you do something really obscure,

1079
01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:13.620
which I think I've talked to before in this podcast,

1080
01:05:13.621 --> 01:05:17.380
like a j Moore's Collin Quinn,
if you guys seen that,

1081
01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:20.560
I'm going to cross promote right now,
not only j more,

1082
01:05:20.561 --> 01:05:25.561
but the opion Anthony show go on youtube and a searched Jay Mohr,

1083
01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:30.160
opie and Anthony and uh,
he calls in,

1084
01:05:30.161 --> 01:05:33.160
he does a series of unbelievable fucking impressions.

1085
01:05:33.610 --> 01:05:38.500
And the most amazing one is he does Colin Quinn.
And if you know,

1086
01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:40.780
who the fuck does that guy?

1087
01:05:42.490 --> 01:05:47.470
Like I've known Collin Forever and I've never noticed any like ticking the way

1088
01:05:47.471 --> 01:05:49.930
he talks and this guy,
you know what I mean as this,

1089
01:05:49.931 --> 01:05:52.000
like one time I saw somebody do a,

1090
01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:57.240
the first person I saw do Tom cruise the fuck show was I watching?

1091
01:05:57.910 --> 01:06:01.210
I was watching.
It wasn't 30 rock.
Excuse me.

1092
01:06:01.310 --> 01:06:02.830
How to clear my throat wasn't 30 rock.

1093
01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:07.780
What was that other show that that dude from friends was on that was like 30

1094
01:06:07.781 --> 01:06:10.120
rock except they were taking it seriously.

1095
01:06:11.470 --> 01:06:15.280
What the fuck was that one called?
Like 60 degrees.

1096
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.680
I can never remember these.
I die.
It wasn't there a number in it,
you know,

1097
01:06:21.130 --> 01:06:24.940
to find Jesus Christ.
We have to do a sketch show.
Is that what it's called?

1098
01:06:24.941 --> 01:06:26.380
I know it was a drama but whatever.

1099
01:06:26.590 --> 01:06:30.640
But there was some kid in there who did impressions accuse fucking unreal.

1100
01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:34.210
He did a Ben Stiller and a uh,

1101
01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:37.000
and a Tom cruise that we're dead on.
And I,

1102
01:06:37.010 --> 01:06:40.420
I've scoured the internet trying to find scoured.
Is that,

1103
01:06:40.421 --> 01:06:42.490
is that really a fucking,
does that the right word?

1104
01:06:42.790 --> 01:06:47.200
Does that mean you got burned now?
Scalded is burned.

1105
01:06:47.770 --> 01:06:50.380
Scoured,
that's not a fucking word.
Whatever.

1106
01:06:50.381 --> 01:06:53.740
I searched high and low near and far all over the Internet.

1107
01:06:53.741 --> 01:06:57.160
I can't fucking find it,
but it's definitely worth a,

1108
01:06:57.580 --> 01:07:01.210
it's definitely worth checking out and a,
and there you go.

1109
01:07:01.270 --> 01:07:04.360
I've talked myself into a corner.
I don't know what the fuck to say now.

1110
01:07:04.361 --> 01:07:07.630
I just realized that usually I just,
you know,
I get a head of steam going,

1111
01:07:07.631 --> 01:07:08.740
this is how I do these podcasts.

1112
01:07:08.741 --> 01:07:12.580
I get a fucking head of steam going and I just start running until I'm out of

1113
01:07:12.581 --> 01:07:14.880
breath.
And then I go back to the screen and,
and,

1114
01:07:14.881 --> 01:07:17.530
and I read like questions or whatever.
But you know what?

1115
01:07:17.531 --> 01:07:21.580
I'm not going to read a question this week.
I'm going to start off with the,

1116
01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:25.420
a couple of stories about dogs.
All right?

1117
01:07:25.690 --> 01:07:30.550
One funny one in one feel good.
One for the Memorial Day holiday.
All right,

1118
01:07:30.551 --> 01:07:34.360
here we go.
Ah,
this comes from some fucking,
dude.

1119
01:07:34.361 --> 01:07:38.530
I don't name names on this.
All right.
I'm old school.
All right.
Uh,
hey bill,

1120
01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:40.130
I have a dog story for you.
Uh,

1121
01:07:40.150 --> 01:07:42.850
whenever I visit my parents who live at the Jersey shore,

1122
01:07:43.090 --> 01:07:47.680
I always take my dog who lives with them to the beach.
Uh,

1123
01:07:47.710 --> 01:07:50.410
personally,
I love that sentence.
Listen to this.

1124
01:07:50.411 --> 01:07:53.230
Whenever I visit my parents who live in the Jersey shore,

1125
01:07:53.530 --> 01:07:58.340
I always take my dog who lives with them to the beach.
Dude,

1126
01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:02.920
if your dog lives with your parents,
that's not your dog.
All right?

1127
01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.780
That's like,
you know,
that's like you banged,

1128
01:08:07.810 --> 01:08:12.430
you'd fucking knocked up your 16 year old girlfriend and you left the baby with

1129
01:08:12.431 --> 01:08:15.010
your parents and they raised it.
You know,
you a run to one.

1130
01:08:15.050 --> 01:08:16.250
Those douchebags in a bar.

1131
01:08:16.790 --> 01:08:19.640
If fucking two in the morning on a Wednesday starts saying how he's got a kid.

1132
01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:24.860
Yeah,
we see my kid
[inaudible] he takes out a picture of it,

1133
01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:28.610
you know,
and it's like,
dude,
it's fucking 2:00 AM on a Wednesday.

1134
01:08:28.611 --> 01:08:32.780
Shouldn't you be home with your kid?
Ah,
yeah,
I don't have it right now.

1135
01:08:32.781 --> 01:08:36.710
She's with my parents.
Well then it's not your fucking kid.
All right.

1136
01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:38.120
Yet you're like a,

1137
01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:43.490
you're like his brother sold a brother who's out,
like,
like chuck on happy days.

1138
01:08:43.491 --> 01:08:44.390
Anybody remember that?

1139
01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:48.470
How many people out there realize that Richie Cunningham actually had an older

1140
01:08:48.471 --> 01:08:51.530
brother during the first season named chuck and he didn't know what the fuck to

1141
01:08:51.531 --> 01:08:52.364
do with them.

1142
01:08:52.850 --> 01:08:57.050
So they just had them go off to college and then they just never used them
again.

1143
01:08:57.051 --> 01:09:00.980
And then after while they literally started just saying that they got two kids

1144
01:09:00.981 --> 01:09:04.760
and they never address that kid anymore,
you know,
ever again.

1145
01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:09.320
That's what your fucking dogs life sir.
It's like chuck on happy days.

1146
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:10.423
But anyways,

1147
01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:13.500
let's read the rest of the story because this is actually a funny story.
Uh,

1148
01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:18.140
my dog is 110 pound golden retriever who basically looks like a furry keg with

1149
01:09:18.141 --> 01:09:21.070
legs.
Goddamn.
And I can't fucking read it.
So anyways,

1150
01:09:21.071 --> 01:09:24.740
so I had my dog at the beach and his favorite thing to do with the beaches to go

1151
01:09:24.741 --> 01:09:27.620
in the water and swim after tennis balls.
Uh,

1152
01:09:27.621 --> 01:09:31.400
so one day I'm at the beach and this is school trip of what seems to be a fourth

1153
01:09:31.401 --> 01:09:36.350
graders or fifth graders.
And they're looking at see life in a jetty.
Sir.

1154
01:09:36.351 --> 01:09:39.320
I like how you wrote jetty.
Like everybody knows what the fuck a jetty is.

1155
01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:40.250
What does a jetty,

1156
01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:45.580
is that a little pool of water that gathers during high tide and then remains

1157
01:09:45.621 --> 01:09:49.400
during low tide?
Is that what a jetty is?
I don't know.

1158
01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:53.420
I know it's not a lagoon cause I watched Gilligan's island.
All right.
Uh,

1159
01:09:53.421 --> 01:09:57.320
so a few of the kids came up to me and asked me if it was okay if they could

1160
01:09:57.321 --> 01:09:59.180
play with my dog.
So I told him no problem.

1161
01:09:59.570 --> 01:10:02.460
And the kids are getting a kick out of watch my dog run to the water and fetch

1162
01:10:02.461 --> 01:10:03.294
the tennis ball.

1163
01:10:03.410 --> 01:10:07.040
So one of the kids yells over to his friend who's busy looking in the jetty.

1164
01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:08.000
He's like,
hey dude,

1165
01:10:08.090 --> 01:10:10.340
you've gotta come over here and check out how cool this dog it.

1166
01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:13.280
At which point the kid in the looking in the jetty says,

1167
01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:18.170
no way you guys are missing out.
There's a whole bunch of crustaceans over here.

1168
01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:23.180
So the kid who's standing next to me just sort of turns and looks at me and
goes,

1169
01:10:23.690 --> 01:10:24.710
what a faggot.

1170
01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:29.570
And I just burst out laughing because I was thinking the exact same thing

1171
01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:35.690
adds a fucking hilarious story right there.
People,

1172
01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:39.530
I don't know if it went by you,
but that was a funny God damn story.

1173
01:10:39.710 --> 01:10:43.730
That's the funny thing about being an adult if you're younger.
Yeah.

1174
01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:45.140
I guess you think that,

1175
01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:48.620
you know you're going to get mature and you're not gonna think that shit that

1176
01:10:48.621 --> 01:10:50.060
you would have thought in fourth grade.

1177
01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:55.400
And that's not what being an adult is being adult is,
I guess,

1178
01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:58.850
still thinking the same shit that a fourth grader thinks.

1179
01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:01.970
But you gotta act like you're not thinking.
You know,
like,

1180
01:11:01.971 --> 01:11:05.720
I'd like to think if I was there,
I would have said,
uh,
you know,

1181
01:11:06.710 --> 01:11:09.800
you shouldn't use that word.
It's very offensive,
uh,

1182
01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:12.440
Bababa and gone down that politically correct route.

1183
01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:16.530
But I probably would have left too.
You know what I mean?

1184
01:11:16.780 --> 01:11:21.360
And that was just funny on a lot of levels where the kid was being a little

1185
01:11:21.361 --> 01:11:21.960
pussy.

1186
01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:26.310
And the fact that a fourth grader would say that and the fact that it's coming

1187
01:11:26.311 --> 01:11:28.530
out of a fourth graders mouth,
you know what I mean?
I,

1188
01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:34.920
I would challenge one of those politically correct people.
You know,

1189
01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:36.570
I don't,
I don't,
I,
you know what,

1190
01:11:36.571 --> 01:11:39.300
I just talked myself into a fucking corner again,
I don't know what to say.

1191
01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:42.300
This is one of these deals,
you know,
it is really people,
I had a big argument,

1192
01:11:42.301 --> 01:11:43.134
my girlfriend,

1193
01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:46.710
and she's walking the dog right now and I know she's coming back in a half hour

1194
01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:51.510
and she's worked,
she's going to come in and she's not going to argue with me.

1195
01:11:51.630 --> 01:11:52.080
Okay.

1196
01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:54.810
For you douchebags that think you're going to get a little behind the scenes

1197
01:11:54.811 --> 01:11:55.830
here,
my relationship.

1198
01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:59.430
But she's definitely got to give me the silent treatment and as much as I'm

1199
01:11:59.431 --> 01:12:01.940
going to try to block her out,
it's a,

1200
01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:05.040
I'm not going to be able to do it because her silence is just going to be

1201
01:12:05.041 --> 01:12:09.750
fucking washing over me,
you know?
So whatever.

1202
01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:13.710
Um,
I had one of those arguments you have,
you have to have in a relationship.

1203
01:12:13.711 --> 01:12:17.590
Every once in awhile he got to blow the air out of the pipes and,
uh,

1204
01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:19.740
that's what I did and I'm going to be paying for it today.

1205
01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:24.150
So I hope your guys Memorial Day is working out a little better than mine.

1206
01:12:24.210 --> 01:12:25.710
What do you think about that?
Okay.

1207
01:12:25.770 --> 01:12:28.650
And how about a little pat on the back for me on a nice fucking holiday,

1208
01:12:28.651 --> 01:12:33.060
actually doing this God damn podcast has 17 fucking free minutes so far.

1209
01:12:33.330 --> 01:12:36.000
I gotta tell you I'm not doing 50 minutes.
I know.
I always say that,

1210
01:12:36.001 --> 01:12:39.810
but I'm not doing it this week.
Okay?
I got shit to do.
I've got laundry going.

1211
01:12:40.250 --> 01:12:40.940
All right,

1212
01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:44.570
I've got a whole bunch of shit I got to do before I can then go to a goddamn

1213
01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:49.640
barbecue show off my pasty white legs and have a burger because that's what the

1214
01:12:49.801 --> 01:12:53.190
fuck I'm doing.
Um,
so anyways,
you know,

1215
01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:56.100
before I get too far down the road,
that is a new,

1216
01:12:56.310 --> 01:13:01.200
that is a new segment here where you have to tell a bad story about a group of

1217
01:13:01.201 --> 01:13:05.730
people that just consistently always gets good press and don't fucking make one

1218
01:13:05.731 --> 01:13:09.450
up either.
Okay.
If you have one,
send one in.
If you don't,

1219
01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:12.510
please don't waste my time.
People always try and do that.

1220
01:13:12.511 --> 01:13:16.080
Like I don't read a lot of the shit that people send me cause it's just,

1221
01:13:16.081 --> 01:13:17.460
you know,
some of the revenge stories,

1222
01:13:17.490 --> 01:13:20.820
that's why I kind of stopped doing it because they really got like ridiculous,

1223
01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:21.840
you know,

1224
01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:26.250
they started getting like James Bond ask and I might do the overhead of this

1225
01:13:26.251 --> 01:13:30.180
revenge is six figures.
Okay.
This didn't happen.

1226
01:13:30.930 --> 01:13:33.030
So anyways,
yeah.
If he,
if you knew,
you know,

1227
01:13:33.031 --> 01:13:37.980
a nun who was being a little cunty one day,
uh,

1228
01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:42.330
who else gets good press?
Kids get great press.
You know,

1229
01:13:42.420 --> 01:13:44.430
like they can do no wrong like they have,

1230
01:13:44.580 --> 01:13:47.430
they're not aware that they're doing wrong.
You know,

1231
01:13:48.750 --> 01:13:51.870
I don't know if you don't hate kids on some level,

1232
01:13:51.990 --> 01:13:56.550
you just not being honest with yourself.
All right.
Um,

1233
01:13:56.580 --> 01:13:59.490
what have we got here?
Let's go with the,
uh,
the questions for the week.
All right.

1234
01:13:59.491 --> 01:14:02.760
Question number one,
Bill.
Uh,

1235
01:14:02.761 --> 01:14:07.440
if you had the choice to resurrect either resurrect,
either bond Scott,

1236
01:14:08.970 --> 01:14:11.070
Jimi Hendrix or John Bonam for one night,

1237
01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:16.150
who would you want to see in concert?
Uh,

1238
01:14:16.151 --> 01:14:21.070
you son of a bitch.
That's a hard one.
Um,

1239
01:14:21.071 --> 01:14:26.071
huge ACDC fan and I've always hated the fact that I never got to see bond Scott,

1240
01:14:28.930 --> 01:14:33.270
but Jimi Hendrix,
that would be like being able to see fucking,
uh,

1241
01:14:34.930 --> 01:14:37.630
I can't even say Jordan cause I got to see him play.

1242
01:14:38.770 --> 01:14:41.350
I would tell you that story when I saw,
uh,
Michael Jordan play,

1243
01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:44.620
I saw him in North Carolina and that when he played with the tar heels,

1244
01:14:44.770 --> 01:14:49.210
this is a story for people who live in North Carolina because I in this,

1245
01:14:49.390 --> 01:14:53.080
in the place was not packed.
I might've told this story before.

1246
01:14:53.081 --> 01:14:55.750
I can't even fucking remember.
I talk on my cell phone so much.

1247
01:14:55.751 --> 01:15:00.370
My brain's mush basically.
I was living in North Carolina in 87,

1248
01:15:00.371 --> 01:15:02.650
88.
And uh,

1249
01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:07.330
it was a year before the Charlotte Hornets,

1250
01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:09.070
we're going to start in the NBA.

1251
01:15:09.430 --> 01:15:14.380
So to get people excited about a NBA hoop,
you know,

1252
01:15:14.381 --> 01:15:18.160
cause obviously down there they got to a backhoe road and all that fucking shit.

1253
01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:21.160
They're really big into college ball to get people excited.

1254
01:15:21.370 --> 01:15:25.600
What they did was they had to scrimmages at the Dean Dome at the University of

1255
01:15:25.601 --> 01:15:28.780
North Carolina.
And um,

1256
01:15:29.230 --> 01:15:34.230
what they did was they had a basically two games of professional hoop,

1257
01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:39.160
like scrimmage hoop and each team had a former tar heel on it.

1258
01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:42.850
And one of the Games was a,

1259
01:15:42.890 --> 01:15:45.430
the Chicago Bulls verse.

1260
01:15:45.431 --> 01:15:48.430
I want to say the Cleveland Cavaliers.

1261
01:15:48.431 --> 01:15:50.530
So you had Michael Jordan,

1262
01:15:51.010 --> 01:15:55.060
former tar heel and then you had Brad Doherty on the Cavaliers.

1263
01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:57.160
And uh,
so I've,

1264
01:15:57.161 --> 01:16:01.540
I've got to see Michael Jordan back when he was skinny and he had hair and he,

1265
01:16:01.541 --> 01:16:04.390
and he only had one dunk,
but it was cool.
It was so early.

1266
01:16:04.391 --> 01:16:08.230
I told this story before,
I remember that I told this story before.

1267
01:16:08.310 --> 01:16:11.980
It didn't I or did I tell it in a bar?
I can't fucking remember.

1268
01:16:12.130 --> 01:16:14.440
But I remember it was so early in Jordan's career,

1269
01:16:14.620 --> 01:16:17.920
I was nudging my mom going this,
watch that guy.
That guy's good.

1270
01:16:18.610 --> 01:16:21.670
You know that guy's good.
Can you fucking believe that?

1271
01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:25.870
And then the other game was the Los Angeles Lakers cause they had James worthy

1272
01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:26.980
former tar heel.

1273
01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:32.220
And I want to say they played the Seattle Supersonics and it was a Sam Perkins,

1274
01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:34.540
but I can't fuck I remember.

1275
01:16:34.541 --> 01:16:38.980
So if anybody from North Carolina or if you can Google it and somehow it was in

1276
01:16:38.981 --> 01:16:43.780
the dean dome.
I remember that.
I do remember that.
And it wasn't nearly,
it was,

1277
01:16:43.781 --> 01:16:47.920
it was probably three quarters full,
not even maybe 60% fucking full.

1278
01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:53.440
Um,
Jesus Christ.
Can I get back to the fucking questionnaire?
All right.
Bonds,

1279
01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:56.710
Scott,
Jimi Hendrix man or John Bonam.

1280
01:16:58.990 --> 01:17:03.160
Ah,
fuck.
You know,
I can't,
I can't,
I can't fucking answer that.

1281
01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:11.450
John Bonam Moba Deck
Jimi Hendrix.
Well,
I'll tell you yes,
if I was going to see,

1282
01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:14.000
you know what?
I would have to flip a coin,

1283
01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:19.130
which doesn't even work out mathematically because his three fucking people,

1284
01:17:19.670 --> 01:17:24.530
I'd have to throw a dart.
All right.
I got to MIT.
Bon Scott is out.

1285
01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:27.560
God dammit.
I never thought I'd say that.
Okay.

1286
01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:32.060
But the thing about Jimmy Hendrickson,
John Bonam is they,
they changed

1287
01:17:34.010 --> 01:17:37.010
Jimi Hendrix changed fucking what you thought was what you could do on the

1288
01:17:37.011 --> 01:17:40.070
guitar and John Barnum,
you know,

1289
01:17:40.071 --> 01:17:44.150
basically he brought rock drumming into the modern era.

1290
01:17:44.151 --> 01:17:48.500
So fucking can't,
what a question.
All right,

1291
01:17:48.501 --> 01:17:51.140
now this is all I can tell you.
I would throw a dart between Jimmy Hendrickson,

1292
01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:55.370
John Bonam,
and when I would see Jimi Hendrix,
it would be with band of Gypsies,

1293
01:17:55.730 --> 01:18:00.200
not with the experience.
All right?
Cause that,
uh,
that live album,

1294
01:18:00.201 --> 01:18:04.100
he has [inaudible] we plays machine gun and all that shit.

1295
01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:07.760
[inaudible] Ba da Ba da Ba da Ba du bad.
That one with Bob.

1296
01:18:07.790 --> 01:18:11.030
I was at buddy miles on drums in a Billy Cox,

1297
01:18:11.031 --> 01:18:15.580
whatever his fucking name is on base that I would,
I'd want,
that's what I wanted.

1298
01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:19.070
I would want to see him on at that,
wherever they take that.

1299
01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:23.960
Was it in San Francisco at the Fillmore,
remember that shit.

1300
01:18:24.260 --> 01:18:29.260
And I would see John Bonam at a Royal Albert Hall and I would be backstage and I

1301
01:18:29.631 --> 01:18:32.750
would be able to see his fucking based from fourth to figure out what the fuck

1302
01:18:32.751 --> 01:18:33.584
he was doing.

1303
01:18:33.980 --> 01:18:38.000
Do you guys ever listen to old live albums or you ever watch old concert footage

1304
01:18:38.001 --> 01:18:43.001
of how polite rock shows where like the promoter would literally come out and

1305
01:18:43.490 --> 01:18:47.080
they,
they would like announced the band like on that Jimi Hendrix one,

1306
01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:48.591
it's really cool.

1307
01:18:48.591 --> 01:18:52.100
Like this promoter comes out and people have this little polite apar applause

1308
01:18:52.910 --> 01:18:55.670
and a,
the here this for murder going out,
you know,

1309
01:18:55.671 --> 01:18:58.430
welcome to the Fillmore west tonight.

1310
01:18:58.431 --> 01:19:02.730
We have a wonderful new band.
Ah,
Babababa Blah,

1311
01:19:02.790 --> 01:19:06.860
all this type of shit.
And in the background,
Jimmy's already playing.
He says

1312
01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:11.480
[inaudible] and the fucking promoter is talking over it.

1313
01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:16.070
It gives me chill the second he's done,
then they just fucking go into the song.

1314
01:19:17.150 --> 01:19:18.620
You know?
Maybe because I'm old now,

1315
01:19:18.621 --> 01:19:22.550
I would love to go see a great band and be able to sit down and just fucking

1316
01:19:22.551 --> 01:19:27.380
enjoy them as musicians.
I hate the fact that I have to fucking stand up,

1317
01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:30.980
you know,
and look around that Douche bag,

1318
01:19:31.010 --> 01:19:33.710
who puts his fucking girlfriend on his shoulders?

1319
01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:37.550
You want to talk about a fucking pussy whipped individual.

1320
01:19:38.570 --> 01:19:41.510
It's already bad enough that you probably had to buy the fucking tickets.

1321
01:19:41.690 --> 01:19:44.780
You had to pay for parking.
You're already fucking whatever,
two,

1322
01:19:44.781 --> 01:19:48.140
300 bucks in the hall,
you know?
And then on top of that,

1323
01:19:48.250 --> 01:19:52.430
you've got to put your fucking chick on your shoulders,
right?
See,

1324
01:19:52.540 --> 01:19:52.881
you're literally,

1325
01:19:52.881 --> 01:19:56.930
your spinal cord is crunching down so she can get up there and make eyes over

1326
01:19:56.931 --> 01:20:00.980
there with the fucking lead singer and possibly even flash your tits that she'll

1327
01:20:00.981 --> 01:20:04.340
then fucking blame on whatever the weed was fucking laced with.

1328
01:20:04.970 --> 01:20:09.480
You're actually helping her to maybe bang another guy at that point.

1329
01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:11.950
You know,
because it's the lead singer likes her.

1330
01:20:12.010 --> 01:20:15.580
He just gives the nod to the fucking,
the,
uh,

1331
01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:17.750
his go gather some pussy guy.

1332
01:20:18.140 --> 01:20:20.800
And then when he comes down there and he taps your girlfriend on the shoulder,

1333
01:20:20.801 --> 01:20:23.510
says he wants to meet him,
you know,
you sitting there going like,

1334
01:20:23.690 --> 01:20:25.640
you want to say no,
you can't do that.
But you know,

1335
01:20:25.641 --> 01:20:29.770
you're never going to hear the end of it because that was a dream to go see a

1336
01:20:31.370 --> 01:20:35.830
fucking I Eddie fucking Douche bag,
whatever his fucking name is Eddie vetter.

1337
01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:38.680
Right.
I,
you know,

1338
01:20:38.681 --> 01:20:42.250
I totally lost control of that story because my washing machine just started

1339
01:20:42.580 --> 01:20:45.700
beeping to let me know that the a load of clothes has done.

1340
01:20:45.701 --> 01:20:47.290
This is what I'm doing with my fucking,

1341
01:20:49.150 --> 01:20:52.580
my memorial day all listen to the sirens.
You know,

1342
01:20:52.581 --> 01:20:55.240
be funny if I could actually do this,
this podcast live.

1343
01:20:55.630 --> 01:20:59.450
And that was a bunch of firemen coming over here to kick my ass,
you know,

1344
01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:03.220
and just to be traditional,
they didn't break down the door with an ax.

1345
01:21:03.221 --> 01:21:05.860
They actually put the ladder up just to confuse me.

1346
01:21:06.970 --> 01:21:09.520
Jesus Christ is my house on fire.
Here it comes.

1347
01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:11.950
<v 6>It would have that moment</v>

1348
01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:15.560
<v 7>and there it goes.</v>

1349
01:21:16.970 --> 01:21:17.803
<v 6>Ah,
right.</v>

1350
01:21:21.850 --> 01:21:24.880
<v 7>He's winded down.
Okay,
keep going.</v>

1351
01:21:24.910 --> 01:21:28.420
Jesus Christ thought my place was on fire there for a second.

1352
01:21:30.070 --> 01:21:31.900
Um,
anyways,
so that's what I would do.

1353
01:21:31.901 --> 01:21:36.040
I would pick between Jimmy Hendrickson Bon Scott and I would throw a dart and

1354
01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:41.500
uh,
I have to admit,
I think I would see Jimi Hendrix in the end of it there,

1355
01:21:41.501 --> 01:21:45.300
I made my decision.
I would see Jimi Hendrix.
Dude,

1356
01:21:45.301 --> 01:21:49.060
that was a great fucking question.
That really was a great question.

1357
01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:53.820
Here comes another goddamn truck.
You know what?

1358
01:21:53.821 --> 01:21:57.780
This is some douchebag on memorial day already burned down their fucking

1359
01:21:57.781 --> 01:22:02.070
backyard with their,
with their Hibachi Jesus Christ.

1360
01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:03.840
There's the one where you got to steer in the back.

1361
01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:09.670
Holy Shit,
this,
stop it on my street.

1362
01:22:11.110 --> 01:22:13.450
What would you do with the middle of this fucking podcast?

1363
01:22:13.451 --> 01:22:16.090
All of a sudden somebody came on while we're like a megaphone,

1364
01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:21.880
Marie Tangerine bind everybody on the street,
eighth to evacuate.

1365
01:22:23.290 --> 01:22:24.780
Do you know that happened to me when I was a kid?

1366
01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:30.210
Jesus Christ is for fucking fire trucks right outside my window.

1367
01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:33.990
I feel like one of those guys,
I feel like Jimmy Olsen,

1368
01:22:33.991 --> 01:22:36.450
like I'm getting the scoop right now.
You know what?

1369
01:22:36.451 --> 01:22:39.210
Now I have to go over and I have to investigate.

1370
01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:44.400
Let me bring my little fucking podcast station over here.
You know,

1371
01:22:44.401 --> 01:22:47.670
it'd be great if there was one right below the window and I could actually stick

1372
01:22:47.671 --> 01:22:49.260
my head out with,

1373
01:22:49.261 --> 01:22:53.610
I actually wear headphones and I got this microphone with the orange screen on
it

1374
01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:59.010
and I just started talking like it was the 1920s scares me.
Sad.

1375
01:22:59.020 --> 01:23:02.130
What's going on down there?
Trying to get the scope.

1376
01:23:03.990 --> 01:23:05.620
Why can't I open my fucking windows?

1377
01:23:07.830 --> 01:23:08.663
<v 1>You know what's funny?</v>

1378
01:23:09.550 --> 01:23:13.180
Do you ever notice like whenever like some fucking old lady twists are goddamn

1379
01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:17.070
ankle,
like 17 firetrucks show up.
It's like,
is it really necessary?

1380
01:23:18.350 --> 01:23:22.580
Why don't you put all the the old lady broker fucking hip shit on one truck,

1381
01:23:24.020 --> 01:23:27.110
dude,
there's no smoke.
There's nothing.

1382
01:23:27.111 --> 01:23:29.330
There's four fucking fire trucks

1383
01:23:32.030 --> 01:23:36.700
for fire trucks.
Oh my God.
Is that a,
Oh that is a woman.

1384
01:23:36.701 --> 01:23:39.520
I thought that was a guy.
Jesus Christ.
Somebody just came walking by

1385
01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:42.860
looking like they were in one of those,
you know,

1386
01:23:42.861 --> 01:23:47.480
those eighties bands that just uh,
they all just had like,
you know,

1387
01:23:47.481 --> 01:23:48.950
the one hit wonders,
but there was,
there was,

1388
01:23:48.951 --> 01:23:52.040
there was that whole scene like they weren't like Duran Duran.

1389
01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:55.820
They actually thought like,
they were like artistic.
What the,

1390
01:23:55.821 --> 01:23:58.970
what the fuck kind of bands were those.
They weren't,
it wasn't like heavy metal.

1391
01:23:59.150 --> 01:24:03.900
It wasn't rock,
um,
new wave.

1392
01:24:04.110 --> 01:24:04.943
That's right.

1393
01:24:06.610 --> 01:24:09.700
I thought it was some guy dressed like he was front a new wave band and ended up

1394
01:24:09.701 --> 01:24:12.130
just being,
I didn't,
you know,
you know when girls like put their,
their,

1395
01:24:12.131 --> 01:24:14.290
their ponytail,
you know,

1396
01:24:14.291 --> 01:24:18.930
and they wrap it around the front and you can't fucking see it.
Dude,

1397
01:24:18.931 --> 01:24:22.050
there's no sense of urgency.
Now they're backing the fire truck up.

1398
01:24:22.990 --> 01:24:23.930
I want this is,

1399
01:24:23.931 --> 01:24:27.600
this is one of these times when I just wish I was old so I could go out there

1400
01:24:27.601 --> 01:24:31.680
and just start yelling at him.
You know,
about taxpayers money and Shit,

1401
01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:36.120
dude have fucked up is that I was making fun of firemen,

1402
01:24:38.170 --> 01:24:41.470
you know,
at the beginning of this podcast.

1403
01:24:41.770 --> 01:24:45.400
And for fucking fire show up.
You know what?
This is the thing.

1404
01:24:45.430 --> 01:24:49.840
I have to close the window because my voice really carries and I say fuck a lot.

1405
01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:52.900
Not to mention the word cunt,
so I'm going to have to,

1406
01:24:52.901 --> 01:24:56.560
you know when they always leave the fire engines running,
you know?

1407
01:24:56.590 --> 01:25:01.420
Who Do you think pays for that gas?
Huh?
We do
say this is great.

1408
01:25:01.421 --> 01:25:03.520
This is the new segment right here.

1409
01:25:03.521 --> 01:25:07.900
I can trash fireman if there's a fire man.
Listen right now,

1410
01:25:08.380 --> 01:25:10.990
is that a fire man or a fireman?
You know,

1411
01:25:11.030 --> 01:25:14.020
if one of you motherfuckers is listening right now,
can you answer that?
Why?

1412
01:25:14.021 --> 01:25:19.000
When there's no smoke,
there's no fire.
Why do 18 trucks show up?

1413
01:25:19.730 --> 01:25:22.650
You guys all just bored or you're trying to get away from that.
Get that,

1414
01:25:22.890 --> 01:25:27.140
that the fat fuck down the firehouse.
Who's making the Chili?
You know,
isn't that,

1415
01:25:27.770 --> 01:25:30.380
isn't there like always there was always a cook down there,
isn't there?

1416
01:25:31.110 --> 01:25:32.670
He's got one of those big mustaches.

1417
01:25:34.370 --> 01:25:37.900
<v 7>Hey,
what do you make it today?
They have Freddy.
Oh,
Megan.
Megan.</v>

1418
01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:40.160
Some fucking Chile.
Really?

1419
01:25:40.700 --> 01:25:44.300
You're going to make some give famous fucking red hot chili and then I'm going

1420
01:25:44.301 --> 01:25:47.450
to have had that in my mouth and I'm,
I going to go fight a fucking fire.

1421
01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:48.313
You asshole.

1422
01:25:50.460 --> 01:25:53.640
<v 1>I bought some Koolaid.
Now I'm fascinated.</v>

1423
01:25:53.641 --> 01:25:57.750
Can you hear the rumble of those engines?
You know a lot of checks like firemen,

1424
01:25:58.530 --> 01:26:02.640
they do to some about him.
You know,
they rescue people,
you know,

1425
01:26:03.060 --> 01:26:04.060
they that raincoat

1426
01:26:05.290 --> 01:26:09.290
<v 7>sort of perverted.
It's like,
you know,
they naked under there.
Is he going to show?</v>

1427
01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:12.440
Is it going to show me his hose?
There's a,

1428
01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:15.200
there's a bunch of them walking around and they have fucking rain coats.

1429
01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:21.420
Jesus Christ.
You know something I gotta admit.

1430
01:26:22.740 --> 01:26:25.050
You know what?
I wouldn't,
I would walk out on my balcony.

1431
01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:28.420
I actually have a little fucking balcony I could be standing on right now.

1432
01:26:28.421 --> 01:26:29.920
I could figure out what the fuck's going on.
I,

1433
01:26:29.921 --> 01:26:32.430
I can't even do the rest of this podcast.
This is ridiculous.

1434
01:26:34.250 --> 01:26:37.100
Was that really me talking?
I just wants to some accent there.
I usually say,

1435
01:26:37.101 --> 01:26:40.520
this is ridiculous.
This is ridiculous.
Um,
all right,

1436
01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:43.620
I'm going to try to fucking answer the rest of these questions is for fire

1437
01:26:43.630 --> 01:26:47.030
trucks.
Sit outside and people walk around.
Is it a chemical spill?

1438
01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:49.700
<v 6>All right.
That concludes part one.</v>

1439
01:26:49.701 --> 01:26:53.900
And I have no idea why there's such a huge echo on this.
I'm using the,
uh,

1440
01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:58.610
the recorder from my,
my fucking laptop,
so that ends part one.

1441
01:26:58.611 --> 01:27:03.020
Now just go listen to part two just in case you're a complete moron and you

1442
01:27:03.021 --> 01:27:06.140
didn't know that that's what you were supposed to do.
Okay.

1443
01:27:10.780 --> 01:27:11.411
Hey,
what's up?

1444
01:27:11.411 --> 01:27:16.411
This is bill burr and this is part two of the Monday morning podcasts from May

1445
01:27:17.350 --> 01:27:19.060
25th,
2009.
And for the life of me,

1446
01:27:19.061 --> 01:27:21.550
I don't know what that fucking echo was all about.

1447
01:27:23.450 --> 01:27:25.920
<v 7>Um,
oh yeah,
started to tell the story yet,
when I was a kid,
uh,</v>

1448
01:27:25.921 --> 01:27:29.640
this fucking guy's barn burned down and evidently he ran this big business and

1449
01:27:29.641 --> 01:27:33.870
he had toxics toxic waste and these big oil drums.

1450
01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:37.470
So evidently they went around to every house in the neighborhood,

1451
01:27:37.471 --> 01:27:40.860
knocking on the door,
telling everybody to get the fuck out of their house.

1452
01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:45.390
And I don't know if they forgot to go to our house or what,

1453
01:27:45.391 --> 01:27:49.120
but we didn't know.
We didn't know.

1454
01:27:49.150 --> 01:27:52.840
So me and my brother went out to do our paper routes in the morning.

1455
01:27:53.350 --> 01:27:56.320
That's how white my childhood was.
You know,

1456
01:27:56.410 --> 01:27:59.680
right after I had a piece of toast with that little square piece of butter on
it.

1457
01:27:59.681 --> 01:28:00.514
I went out

1458
01:28:02.140 --> 01:28:04.990
part of this complete breakfast after I had my complete breakfast,

1459
01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:09.610
I went out to do my paper route and there was all this smoke in the air and

1460
01:28:09.611 --> 01:28:10.241
there was nobody.

1461
01:28:10.241 --> 01:28:12.940
We lived on a busy street and there were no cars and there was just this

1462
01:28:12.941 --> 01:28:15.910
firehose going all the way up right down the middle of the street.

1463
01:28:17.290 --> 01:28:20.950
So we will let a wheel like,
oh wow,
that's cool.
Right?
We didn't give a fuck.

1464
01:28:21.910 --> 01:28:26.410
So,
uh,
I ride my bike down the street to do my first customer,

1465
01:28:26.411 --> 01:28:28.870
which is in the direction of the fire.

1466
01:28:29.860 --> 01:28:34.720
So I drove down there on my bicycle and there's a fireman standing there and

1467
01:28:34.721 --> 01:28:37.390
he's got,
you know,
the,
the fucking oxygen mask on.

1468
01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:42.220
And he literally looks at me and he did literally the cartoon doubletake like

1469
01:28:42.250 --> 01:28:44.440
Yeti,
yet it,
it,
you know,
like what the fleet,

1470
01:28:44.470 --> 01:28:47.890
like he couldn't believe what he was saying.
There's all his smoker here.

1471
01:28:50.050 --> 01:28:50.831
Here I come up,

1472
01:28:50.831 --> 01:28:55.831
my little howdy doody face comes up to street riding on my little bicycle and he

1473
01:28:55.871 --> 01:28:59.500
comes and he starts screaming at me through that mass going like your grandma

1474
01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:03.913
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

1475
01:29:04.370 --> 01:29:07.970
<v 7>just dropping the f bomb and I'll be like,
I have a paper route.</v>

1476
01:29:08.010 --> 01:29:09.650
I had no idea.

1477
01:29:14.350 --> 01:29:16.450
So we ended up,
uh,
you know,

1478
01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:21.790
maybe that's why my memory sucks cause I sat there breathing in,
breathe in,

1479
01:29:21.791 --> 01:29:24.910
all that shit.
Allegedly the guy who's who,
uh,

1480
01:29:25.390 --> 01:29:29.860
whose barn it was started radio shack.
That was,
that was the,
uh,

1481
01:29:30.580 --> 01:29:35.200
that was the rumor.
So anyways,
here we go.
Ah,
question number two.

1482
01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:39.400
Hey Bill,
I want to know what you think of old people going,
going to the gym.

1483
01:29:39.940 --> 01:29:42.970
Every time I see this 60 year old guy doing sit ups at the gym,

1484
01:29:42.971 --> 01:29:43.960
I feel sorry for him.

1485
01:29:44.380 --> 01:29:48.040
I work out so I can stay healthy and live to see old age.

1486
01:29:48.430 --> 01:29:52.720
Once I see old age,
it's mission accomplished,
right?

1487
01:29:53.470 --> 01:29:55.690
I think one,
uh,
when I see these old people,

1488
01:29:55.691 --> 01:29:59.230
I think one or two things is going on.
Either he doesn't know he's old,

1489
01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:03.760
which is pathetic or he wants to grow older,
which is even more pathetic.

1490
01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:05.860
I mean,
how selfish can you be?

1491
01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:09.190
Do you want your family to be wiping your ass at 90?

1492
01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:15.640
The big question is,
at what age will you stop working out?

1493
01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:19.990
I'm done at 50.
I got 18 more years to go.
Uh,

1494
01:30:20.020 --> 01:30:24.640
thanks for the podcast.
Uh,
they help my three hour daily commute.

1495
01:30:24.641 --> 01:30:28.030
Make it much easier.
Well,
thank you,
sir.
I'm glad you like them.
Um,

1496
01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:31.900
don't you hate when somebody calls you serve by the way,
our,
ma'am,

1497
01:30:32.530 --> 01:30:35.050
isn't that the worst?
The first day that that fucking happens?

1498
01:30:36.220 --> 01:30:40.900
You just like Jesus,
I really am old.
Okay.
When am I going to stop working out?
Uh,

1499
01:30:40.901 --> 01:30:43.120
I got to met,
dude.
I'm never going to stop working out,

1500
01:30:43.121 --> 01:30:47.890
but I won't be going to the gym.
Maybe I will be.
You know what,
I,
I've just,

1501
01:30:47.891 --> 01:30:52.330
I just sort of,
I've adjusted my workouts to,
uh,

1502
01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:56.680
to with my age.
Like I used to,
I used to,
you know,

1503
01:30:56.681 --> 01:31:01.540
I used to throw the weights around over there.
Oh right.
And,

1504
01:31:02.020 --> 01:31:05.590
uh,
you know,
used to play full court hoop running up and down,

1505
01:31:05.591 --> 01:31:08.620
but my body just can't take that.
I can still lift weights and shit.

1506
01:31:08.621 --> 01:31:12.820
I just get bored doing that.
But,
uh,
as I grow older,
I,
I,
I,

1507
01:31:12.821 --> 01:31:17.821
I've told myself that I'm gradually gonna Morph into yoga and pilates.

1508
01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:21.470
I just paused there way

1509
01:31:21.530 --> 01:31:22.340
<v 9>February fool.</v>

1510
01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:27.170
You yogo you fucking gays solve to where you stretching yourself out as you can

1511
01:31:27.171 --> 01:31:30.230
give welcome bang in the air.
You are gonna do.

1512
01:31:30.750 --> 01:31:33.690
<v 7>Guys are so fucking dumb,
you know?</v>

1513
01:31:33.691 --> 01:31:36.780
And it's just something about anytime you do something smart,

1514
01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:42.270
immediately it's considered feminine.
You know,
if you do something dumb,

1515
01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:42.961
you're a man.

1516
01:31:42.961 --> 01:31:47.280
If you don't work out and he keeps drinking red bear shovin half a fucking cow's

1517
01:31:47.281 --> 01:31:51.240
head into your colon,
then Dan,
Dan,
you're a guy.
But yeah,

1518
01:31:51.241 --> 01:31:55.350
that's what I'm going to do it.
And No,
I'm not gonna.
No,
I'm never stuck.

1519
01:31:55.351 --> 01:31:56.400
I'm going to stop working out.

1520
01:31:56.550 --> 01:32:00.070
I'm never going to stop trying new things and trying to learn shit because when

1521
01:32:00.071 --> 01:32:03.130
you do that shit,
dude,
you die.
You Die.

1522
01:32:03.131 --> 01:32:07.660
And it's very easily to be 32 I've done the math.
You're 32 years old.

1523
01:32:07.661 --> 01:32:08.830
It's very easy to say that.

1524
01:32:08.831 --> 01:32:11.860
You know you're going to say fuck it at 50 you're not dude,

1525
01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:14.920
because the 32 if you're still working out,
that means you still look good,

1526
01:32:14.921 --> 01:32:18.010
which means women are still kind of check in.
You are.
But I'm telling you,
dude,

1527
01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:21.760
it starts dropping off and when it starts fucking dropping off,
you know,

1528
01:32:21.761 --> 01:32:25.290
you're like,
Jesus Christ,
I don't even fucking look at me anymore.
And it's,

1529
01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:29.710
it's going to motivate you or you'll just go into a depression and you,

1530
01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:33.880
we'll spoon with that depression and you'll eat yourself into an early grave

1531
01:32:33.881 --> 01:32:37.060
before you're 50 so those are your options.
All right,

1532
01:32:38.740 --> 01:32:42.640
hang in that dual,
keep working out.
You know,
you want to come that,

1533
01:32:42.670 --> 01:32:46.150
do you want to come that to that fat?
Fuck.
You know what I'm saying?

1534
01:32:46.151 --> 01:32:48.760
We got that big bulge of fat right above your deck.

1535
01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:54.070
You don't want to be that guy.
You know,
he just,
you know,

1536
01:32:54.460 --> 01:32:58.210
you get that old person,
I'm going to die soon.
Smell that's just bad.
You don't,

1537
01:32:58.240 --> 01:33:01.870
you don't want to be that guy.
All right.
Uh,
you know,
just out of curiosity,

1538
01:33:02.350 --> 01:33:05.740
I wonder who the oldest person is who actually listens to this fucking podcast.

1539
01:33:06.700 --> 01:33:07.511
You know,
that's another thing.

1540
01:33:07.511 --> 01:33:10.270
I always want to stay up on music and that type of shit.

1541
01:33:10.630 --> 01:33:14.050
I think that's easy to do when you don't have children,
but,
uh,

1542
01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:18.220
I don't fucking know.
Fail.
Just shut up and move on with the questions.

1543
01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:22.210
I'll right.
Question number three,
Bill.
I'm from Cleveland.
Uh,

1544
01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:26.020
and I've wrote was really s and I'm really psyched about the,
uh,

1545
01:33:27.370 --> 01:33:30.900
Cavalier Orlando's Wednesday game.
It was amazing.

1546
01:33:30.970 --> 01:33:32.890
He had a bit dis pressing at the same time.

1547
01:33:33.490 --> 01:33:38.350
Fortunately the Cavs lost one oh seven one oh six dip protect the day or the

1548
01:33:38.351 --> 01:33:40.480
whole way through.
Uh,

1549
01:33:40.510 --> 01:33:44.350
do you think Lebron will lead the Cavaliers to victory against the magic?

1550
01:33:44.620 --> 01:33:48.400
And who do you anticipate to win the championship?

1551
01:33:50.110 --> 01:33:54.220
Um,
I have to admit,
I don't know shit about basketball.

1552
01:33:54.221 --> 01:33:58.750
And I've started to watch now that the Bruins and the Celtics are knocked out.

1553
01:33:58.780 --> 01:34:02.800
You know,
I wasn't really even watching the Celtics.
I'm just not in the hoop.

1554
01:34:03.700 --> 01:34:07.270
And,
uh,
I got to met,
you know,
Cleveland,
Orlando,

1555
01:34:07.271 --> 01:34:11.140
I don't think you could ask for a better series all but Lakers,
Denver,

1556
01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:13.510
that series has sucked.

1557
01:34:14.890 --> 01:34:17.200
It's like neither team has won a game yet.

1558
01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:21.790
Denver blew the first game,
the Lakers blue,
the second game,

1559
01:34:21.791 --> 01:34:25.450
and Denver blew the third game.
And,
um,

1560
01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:31.560
what's killing me is that I don't see a dominant fucking team in the four

1561
01:34:32.921 --> 01:34:36.370
remaining team.
So I think this is kind of,
it's kind of a weak year.

1562
01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:41.530
I think Lebron is the shit.
And I think that fucking superhero do there.

1563
01:34:41.531 --> 01:34:46.120
What Howard for Orlando is ridiculous and Kobe's ridiculous.

1564
01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:49.600
And what's his face?
Carmelo Anthony is ridiculous.

1565
01:34:49.601 --> 01:34:51.640
And everyone else is regular.

1566
01:34:52.710 --> 01:34:56.710
That just regular standing around watching those guys doing shit,

1567
01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:02.480
you know?
Hey,
we go.
That'll get me a lot of fucking emails.

1568
01:35:02.900 --> 01:35:07.730
All these fucking who?
Peds,
dude.
Oh fuck.
Can you say that?
Stood fucking

1569
01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:14.210
chummy,
whatever,
fucking whatever some black guy name is fucking regular.
He had,

1570
01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:17.600
he had 22 week loan,
70 seats.
I don't give a fuck.

1571
01:35:19.370 --> 01:35:21.410
Pro Hoop is fucking boring.

1572
01:35:21.860 --> 01:35:26.660
The referees control the tempo or the game and the final three minutes takes an

1573
01:35:26.660 --> 01:35:30.760
hour.
Fuck that game.
Okay,
what does that,

1574
01:35:31.030 --> 01:35:32.930
what does that thing that that the commercial that they have,

1575
01:35:32.931 --> 01:35:34.970
when's the next time great will happen?

1576
01:35:35.150 --> 01:35:39.050
I'll tell you when the ref stops blowing his fucking whistle.
Every five seconds.

1577
01:35:40.070 --> 01:35:44.570
Do the second one team goes into the penalty.
Just kiss the rest of your day.

1578
01:35:44.571 --> 01:35:45.170
Goodbye.

1579
01:35:45.170 --> 01:35:49.010
It is the most boring fucking hundred points you're ever going to see in your

1580
01:35:49.011 --> 01:35:53.510
life.
Colby Ryan shooting the front end of a one on one.

1581
01:35:54.650 --> 01:35:58.640
He's 38 or 39 from the line tonight.

1582
01:35:59.810 --> 01:36:03.770
39 38 39 let's fucking divide that by two.

1583
01:36:03.950 --> 01:36:08.660
That's fucking what?
1819 there'll be night.
They'd be his 20th fucking time.

1584
01:36:08.661 --> 01:36:13.420
He's gone to the line 20 fucking times at that point.
And Miss,
oh no.
18 wait,

1585
01:36:13.421 --> 01:36:16.780
can you be 38 39 yeah,
cause you could,
you could go for three point play.

1586
01:36:16.781 --> 01:36:18.440
So whatever.
The guy's gone on line,

1587
01:36:18.441 --> 01:36:21.680
like fucking anywhere from 16 to 20 fucking times,

1588
01:36:22.490 --> 01:36:25.880
20 fucking times.
They blown the whistle with one fucking guy.

1589
01:36:27.620 --> 01:36:31.370
All right.
I know 38 is a high number.
Okay.
But there's nights where he's,

1590
01:36:31.371 --> 01:36:33.590
you know,
20 or 22 from the line.

1591
01:36:36.230 --> 01:36:39.770
It's one guy,
one guy is stopped the game 10 fucking times.
It's,
it's,
it's,

1592
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:44.240
it's the worst.
And I got to Mit,
I think pro football really gets boring.

1593
01:36:45.290 --> 01:36:45.591
You know,

1594
01:36:45.591 --> 01:36:48.710
there's nothing worse than a pro football game against two teams that are

1595
01:36:48.711 --> 01:36:50.660
mediocre.
It's just terrible.

1596
01:36:51.050 --> 01:36:53.060
And it's one of the written other reasons why I love hockey,

1597
01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:57.230
because at the very least,
have two teams suck.
Maybe there'll be a fight,

1598
01:36:58.070 --> 01:37:00.560
you know,
any other sport,

1599
01:37:00.561 --> 01:37:04.850
if there's a fight that is the lead fucking story on sports center.

1600
01:37:04.851 --> 01:37:05.960
Holy Shit,

1601
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:10.220
the benches emptied or this guy charged them out of fucking whatever.

1602
01:37:10.221 --> 01:37:15.221
And hockey is whatever that can happen in any game to Goddamn great sport.

1603
01:37:16.610 --> 01:37:20.150
If you like the movie Mad Max and you don't like hockey and you're very

1604
01:37:20.151 --> 01:37:23.650
inconsistent human being.
All right,
let's get on with computer tips.
Uh,

1605
01:37:23.651 --> 01:37:25.880
we've been doing very basic computer tips,

1606
01:37:26.060 --> 01:37:30.370
helping people like myself are limp along.
And,
uh,

1607
01:37:30.380 --> 01:37:32.480
just to get shit moving here,
I have to admit,

1608
01:37:32.481 --> 01:37:36.020
this person brought in some computer tips this week.
One,
two,
three,
four,

1609
01:37:36.021 --> 01:37:39.800
five of them in the first four.
I knew.
So a few guys,
you know,

1610
01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:43.020
all you guys who are really into computer,
if you guys can,

1611
01:37:43.050 --> 01:37:47.150
can go to the next level here where we can talk about preferences,

1612
01:37:47.780 --> 01:37:51.350
you know,
where you know,
they click on the apple and then Click on preferences,

1613
01:37:51.620 --> 01:37:56.520
go into the applications and if you can break down that shit,
um,

1614
01:37:56.550 --> 01:37:59.400
that would really help me out because I'm really getting good at computers right

1615
01:37:59.401 --> 01:38:03.060
now or much better than I was because you guys,
so I appreciate it.

1616
01:38:03.061 --> 01:38:07.090
So here's the A,
okay.
My girlfriend's back.
Now it's going to get awkward.

1617
01:38:07.091 --> 01:38:10.500
It's going to get awkward.
Um,
all right,
here are some of the uh,

1618
01:38:10.501 --> 01:38:14.190
the questions here.
Uh,
question number,
uh,
or some of the computer tips.

1619
01:38:14.730 --> 01:38:17.160
Computer tip number one.
Uh,

1620
01:38:18.630 --> 01:38:22.050
hold the apple command and the letter x to cut.

1621
01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:24.270
I mean people know this shit.

1622
01:38:24.330 --> 01:38:29.330
Apple Command and the letter C to copy Apple Command and the letter V to paste.

1623
01:38:31.470 --> 01:38:33.090
And this is the one I didn't know.

1624
01:38:33.180 --> 01:38:36.840
Apple Command and the letter Z to undo.

1625
01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:39.510
I didn't know that one.
And that one.

1626
01:38:39.511 --> 01:38:44.310
Basically this guy so eloquently puts when you just fucked up any document,

1627
01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:47.820
email or typing that you just did,

1628
01:38:47.821 --> 01:38:50.790
if you delete something by accident and then hit the,

1629
01:38:50.820 --> 01:38:54.450
just hit apple z and you get it back.
Um,

1630
01:38:55.500 --> 01:38:56.281
and he goes,
God,

1631
01:38:56.281 --> 01:39:01.020
I know you have to know the f three button to separate the screens by now,

1632
01:39:01.021 --> 01:39:05.070
but I just want to make sure since that shit is on the Mac,
you know what dude,

1633
01:39:05.071 --> 01:39:09.750
I didn't know that one f three.
You hit that and that separates all your windows,

1634
01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:12.150
which at which point I said,
what is that for?
Do?

1635
01:39:12.420 --> 01:39:15.120
And that's when I found the calculator,
the date,

1636
01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:19.770
my forecast for the week and the time.
So that's pretty fucking cool.

1637
01:39:20.250 --> 01:39:23.730
I'll actually have to start the podcast with that.
So I won't know the dates but,

1638
01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:28.050
and for anyone,
you know,
I'm kind of be an arrogant ass here cause I am a moron.

1639
01:39:28.210 --> 01:39:32.280
So if you don't know shit like that,
that apple command and the letter x,

1640
01:39:33.870 --> 01:39:37.350
uh,
is basically when you just highlight whatever you just did,

1641
01:39:37.380 --> 01:39:42.380
if you hit the command button and let her ex that will just delete the sentence,

1642
01:39:43.770 --> 01:39:47.460
you know,
apple,
see that will copy it.

1643
01:39:47.461 --> 01:39:50.880
And then Apple v you paste it to somewhere else.
It's very easy to figure out.

1644
01:39:50.881 --> 01:39:53.670
But um,
I think at this point everybody's caught up.

1645
01:39:53.670 --> 01:39:56.970
So if you guys do computer tips,
if you want to take them to the next level,

1646
01:39:57.360 --> 01:40:00.810
that would be greatly appreciated and all you fucking Douche bags out there who

1647
01:40:00.811 --> 01:40:05.760
are good at computer,
just so fucking basic,
this shit that you suck at,
right?

1648
01:40:07.260 --> 01:40:09.240
Okay.
Look at me getting all defensive.
All right.

1649
01:40:09.241 --> 01:40:13.440
You want to hear a heart warming dog story and I'll end the podcast here and

1650
01:40:13.441 --> 01:40:13.891
actually I want,

1651
01:40:13.891 --> 01:40:17.070
I'm going to blow through some underrated overrated because a lot of people sent

1652
01:40:17.071 --> 01:40:21.740
some shit in.
Okay.
Heartwarming dog story.
Uh,
oh.
And also I,

1653
01:40:21.741 --> 01:40:24.150
I gotta have Douche bag of the week.
I forgot about that one.

1654
01:40:25.100 --> 01:40:29.670
Heartwarming dog story.
Uh,
all right,
Bill,
you've probably gotten a lot of emails.

1655
01:40:29.730 --> 01:40:33.420
We're going,
Doug,
I have a dog that we found five years ago.

1656
01:40:33.870 --> 01:40:37.530
I was driving home after work and I saw a yellow lab mix in the middle of the

1657
01:40:37.531 --> 01:40:38.070
road.

1658
01:40:38.070 --> 01:40:42.300
She was running across a busy street with an e color on one of those things.

1659
01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:45.390
The vet's put on a dog and uh,

1660
01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:50.040
I dunno,
fucking dog has been [inaudible].
This is a really long stories.

1661
01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:53.100
So she's running across the street and nobody was stopping.

1662
01:40:53.110 --> 01:40:55.720
She was really scared and confused,
running all over the street.

1663
01:40:55.721 --> 01:40:59.200
Everyone was honking their horns and she was just running back and forth.

1664
01:40:59.201 --> 01:41:03.130
Not sure where to go.
Basically,
she was freaking out.
So I saw in the middle,

1665
01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:06.190
in the midsection of the street waiting to turn.
When I saw her,

1666
01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:08.320
I call her to come over,
which he did,

1667
01:41:08.500 --> 01:41:11.440
and I opened my car door and yanked her in the car.

1668
01:41:15.190 --> 01:41:18.850
Dude,
you got more balls than me.
I would definitely feel bad for the dog,

1669
01:41:18.851 --> 01:41:22.690
but I saw old yeller at the wrong age and I've never just like jaws.

1670
01:41:22.900 --> 01:41:26.620
I saw jaws when I was young and I will not go into the ocean and if there's a

1671
01:41:26.621 --> 01:41:28.420
fucking stray dog freaking out,

1672
01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:33.280
I'm not going to Yank it in my car for fear of getting rabies.
Um,

1673
01:41:33.281 --> 01:41:36.370
I quickly noticed she had a surgical scar on her stomach.

1674
01:41:37.540 --> 01:41:40.840
This dog was scared and she had the most desperate looking arise.

1675
01:41:40.841 --> 01:41:41.561
It really shook me.

1676
01:41:41.561 --> 01:41:45.370
So I brought her home and I put her in the yard while I got our dogs put in

1677
01:41:45.371 --> 01:41:47.080
place where they wouldn't see each other.

1678
01:41:47.590 --> 01:41:49.540
Since I didn't know how this dog would behave.
See,

1679
01:41:49.541 --> 01:41:51.040
this guy really knows about dogs here.

1680
01:41:51.310 --> 01:41:54.460
I quickly found that she was terrified and we're not leave my site.

1681
01:41:54.790 --> 01:41:58.660
She would come over to me and sit on my feet and follow me everywhere I went.

1682
01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:02.800
So we put her in a different room away from our other dog and my wife and I got

1683
01:42:02.801 --> 01:42:07.690
a plan together to find her owner.
Uh,
she was so sweet and terrified.
Uh,

1684
01:42:08.170 --> 01:42:10.870
she must need to get back to her house with her owners.
Right.

1685
01:42:11.170 --> 01:42:14.860
So we put up signs and went around to neighbor's house.
How's the house?

1686
01:42:14.861 --> 01:42:16.870
Door to door to see if we can find the owner.
No luck.

1687
01:42:16.871 --> 01:42:20.500
The next day my wife went to the nearest vet office because we figured that's

1688
01:42:20.501 --> 01:42:25.110
where she had a surgery done.
Well,
they had never seen her before,
but said a,

1689
01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:29.290
the vet,
the vet said he wanted to scan her for uh,
a microchip.

1690
01:42:29.770 --> 01:42:34.060
Turns out she had one and she was from a no kill shelter.

1691
01:42:34.090 --> 01:42:35.890
So we called the shelter.
She was from,

1692
01:42:35.891 --> 01:42:39.640
turns out they kept her at a veterinarian's house down the street,

1693
01:42:39.641 --> 01:42:43.030
but Baba Baba Baba and uh,

1694
01:42:43.031 --> 01:42:44.710
they said that they would come over and pick her up,

1695
01:42:44.711 --> 01:42:46.360
but by this time I was having second thoughts.

1696
01:42:46.361 --> 01:42:50.980
After only two days or other dog had taken tours as well as well.
Um,

1697
01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:52.150
there's,

1698
01:42:52.150 --> 01:42:55.480
Doug loved me after only two days and I can't explain it because my other dog

1699
01:42:55.481 --> 01:42:59.770
could care less about me.
Um,
it's my wife's dog and I,
um,

1700
01:42:59.830 --> 01:43:02.560
and don't get me wrong,
I love him,
but this was different.

1701
01:43:02.561 --> 01:43:06.490
This dog somehow got into my heart.
See,
this is what happened with Cleo.

1702
01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:11.110
I got the dog and after two days I fucking loved the dog.
Um,
so anyways,

1703
01:43:11.111 --> 01:43:13.030
the vet told us,
uh,
her story,

1704
01:43:13.031 --> 01:43:18.031
which was verified later on by the shelter rep who came to approve us,

1705
01:43:19.810 --> 01:43:24.100
uh,
to adopt her for a home.
It turns out she was given up.

1706
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:26.290
I'm really fucking flake in here.

1707
01:43:26.340 --> 01:43:29.710
It turns out she was given up by everyone in the families that adopted her.

1708
01:43:29.711 --> 01:43:34.650
She was adopted five times.
Do that's not a red light flashing.

1709
01:43:34.730 --> 01:43:38.410
She was adopted five times and they keep getting rid of her.
Anyways,

1710
01:43:38.411 --> 01:43:41.740
over the years she's developed some minor behavioral issues such as digging and

1711
01:43:41.741 --> 01:43:46.150
getting out of the yard.
She was placed in when left alone.
Um,

1712
01:43:46.180 --> 01:43:49.960
but whatever her name is Bella,
and while she was a pain in the ass at the time,

1713
01:43:49.961 --> 01:43:53.630
she is,
as you said,
what I come home to.
And uh,

1714
01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:56.480
basically the dude actually loves the dog and rest of the dog and says,

1715
01:43:56.481 --> 01:44:00.920
congrats on Cleo.
What?
Thank you.
I appreciate that.
You know,
I don't know.

1716
01:44:00.950 --> 01:44:03.260
There is something really cool I guess about rescuing a dog,

1717
01:44:03.470 --> 01:44:08.020
but there are a lot of,
if you're a realist,
there's a lot of red flags there.

1718
01:44:09.020 --> 01:44:13.520
Dog had been adopted five fucking times.
Uh,
you know,

1719
01:44:16.730 --> 01:44:19.820
I dunno.
It's a great thing.
God bless you if he adopted dark.
All right,

1720
01:44:19.821 --> 01:44:22.610
let's get onto douche bag of the week.
All right.
His douche bag of the week.

1721
01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:28.040
Some reason this person sends me this email right in the middle of my day.

1722
01:44:28.190 --> 01:44:31.040
Hey Bill,
nice move.
Assuming I'm a female,

1723
01:44:32.450 --> 01:44:35.030
I guess I read one of this dispersant uh,

1724
01:44:35.150 --> 01:44:39.440
questions and I assumed that they were a female so they got all upset going.

1725
01:44:39.441 --> 01:44:43.760
Nice move.
Assuming I'm a female,
since I never sign my name.

1726
01:44:44.030 --> 01:44:49.030
And when you read my comments on your podcast and always refer to me as a male,

1727
01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:54.770
it's just interesting how people will determine if a person is male or female

1728
01:44:54.890 --> 01:44:58.430
without ever meeting them and just reading what they write.

1729
01:44:58.730 --> 01:45:02.980
Why can't a woman writes something about baseball or hockey?
Uh,

1730
01:45:03.020 --> 01:45:04.940
say saying something true,

1731
01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:09.890
saying some true overrated shit without being assumed.
A male.

1732
01:45:11.540 --> 01:45:15.050
And uh,
this is after she,

1733
01:45:15.051 --> 01:45:19.160
the first email she wrote,
she wrote,
Bill,
fuck you.

1734
01:45:20.210 --> 01:45:24.860
And then I wrote,
Hey Sweetie,
happy Monday to you.
Okay.

1735
01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:28.010
So then she sends me this other email,
you know,
eh,

1736
01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:30.020
it's just really interesting how,

1737
01:45:30.140 --> 01:45:32.560
and people then emails without ever meeting them.

1738
01:45:32.570 --> 01:45:37.130
They ask them whether they're male or female.
So I just wrote back really,

1739
01:45:38.210 --> 01:45:42.410
you know,
that's it.
That's all that deserved really.
You know what I mean?

1740
01:45:42.470 --> 01:45:47.210
First of all,
sweetheart,
I don't know if you realize it,
but in the subject area,

1741
01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:51.950
up top it has your full name,
which is a female name.

1742
01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:54.320
And I don't know if you realize this,

1743
01:45:54.620 --> 01:45:58.760
but I get a ton of fucking emails and I don't say people's names,

1744
01:45:58.761 --> 01:46:02.510
so I delete the names and I just read them.
Okay.

1745
01:46:03.260 --> 01:46:06.740
And at that point,
I don't know whether it's male or female,

1746
01:46:06.741 --> 01:46:10.700
it's not a fucking sexist thing.
You fucking psychopath.

1747
01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:15.200
I keep referring to my dog as a male because I fucking always had male dogs.

1748
01:46:15.201 --> 01:46:18.290
My girlfriend keeps giving me shit.
I go,
I got to take them out.

1749
01:46:18.291 --> 01:46:23.000
And she's like her,
you know?
But it's not like,
you know,

1750
01:46:23.001 --> 01:46:27.980
I wouldn't hire you if you had the right.
What a fucking,
you're a Douche bag.

1751
01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:30.410
All right.
You're a big fucking Douche.
But you know,

1752
01:46:30.411 --> 01:46:35.150
you're such a big douchebag that literally 12 other Douche bags could climb in

1753
01:46:35.151 --> 01:46:39.200
your douche bag.
That's how big a fucking Douche bag you were.
Okay.
And that,

1754
01:46:39.201 --> 01:46:41.900
assuming anything,
I get a ton of fucking emails.

1755
01:46:42.620 --> 01:46:45.200
And if somebody writes about hockey,
yeah,

1756
01:46:45.260 --> 01:46:48.800
I do assume that they're fucking mail the same way.

1757
01:46:48.801 --> 01:46:51.930
If somebody wrote about crocheting a fucking Afghan,

1758
01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:53.790
I would assume that there are female,

1759
01:46:54.420 --> 01:46:59.420
I wouldn't be trying to insult the Rosey Greer fucking guy who's into knitting.

1760
01:46:59.580 --> 01:47:03.080
Just generally speaking.
That's a fucking a,

1761
01:47:04.170 --> 01:47:07.320
that's a female thing to do.
All right.

1762
01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:11.310
Doesn't mean I don't respect you and your vagina and your knowledge about
hockey.

1763
01:47:11.970 --> 01:47:16.200
You know,
you know what,
from now on,
I'm just gonna.
I'm gonna fucking a,

1764
01:47:16.370 --> 01:47:19.590
I'm going to say the gender of everybody.
All right.

1765
01:47:19.860 --> 01:47:23.250
Like here's an email from someone who has a Dick.
Uh,

1766
01:47:23.251 --> 01:47:26.820
just a quick notes in regards to the caveman killer.
Remember last week,

1767
01:47:26.821 --> 01:47:28.650
the serial killer thing,
uh,

1768
01:47:28.651 --> 01:47:32.490
using a sharpened stick as a weapon and then burning it is a,

1769
01:47:32.491 --> 01:47:35.820
so there would be no evidence.
Uh,
there's a bit of a problem here,

1770
01:47:36.030 --> 01:47:39.960
although it's genius and inventive and inventive way to do it.

1771
01:47:39.961 --> 01:47:43.410
He would get caught.
Um,
when the autopsy was performed,

1772
01:47:43.411 --> 01:47:47.550
they would come across the fibers,
dirt and residue left behind by said stick.

1773
01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:51.080
They would then do an analysis on the residue to find out what,

1774
01:47:51.130 --> 01:47:55.230
what it was composed of and what type of tree was used to make Swiss cheese of

1775
01:47:55.231 --> 01:47:57.690
the victim.
Now having that information,

1776
01:47:57.691 --> 01:48:01.140
the authorities would then plot out a map of every single area within the state

1777
01:48:01.350 --> 01:48:06.120
or a vicinity of the victim to narrow down where the stick could have come from.

1778
01:48:06.420 --> 01:48:08.850
They would then Jesus crisis as long.

1779
01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:13.880
They would then narrowed down that further based on the composition of the dirt

1780
01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:17.340
in any traces of nutrients and figure out exactly where the,

1781
01:48:17.700 --> 01:48:19.170
what area of the stick came from.

1782
01:48:19.470 --> 01:48:23.760
A mass search would then take place and set area and more likely they would be

1783
01:48:23.761 --> 01:48:27.570
able to pinpoint the spot where the earth was disturbed or the branch that was

1784
01:48:27.571 --> 01:48:32.430
broken within a 24 to 48 hour window concluding that this is the spot where the

1785
01:48:32.431 --> 01:48:33.480
weapon was obtained.

1786
01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:37.650
They were then probably find fibers from the clothing of the perpetrator so they

1787
01:48:37.651 --> 01:48:41.340
would match that.
Later after putting out a new story with the evidence,

1788
01:48:41.341 --> 01:48:45.390
they had someone to come forward saying they saw a car or a person in the area

1789
01:48:45.540 --> 01:48:47.010
that seemed to be out of place.

1790
01:48:47.540 --> 01:48:50.160
Sketchy sketch drawing would be done and released.

1791
01:48:50.550 --> 01:48:54.810
The and the caveman killer would be located and arrested putting a nice tight

1792
01:48:54.811 --> 01:48:59.580
bow on the case would be their ability to match the dirt from the spot where the

1793
01:48:59.581 --> 01:49:01.830
weapon was found in the,
to the dirt,

1794
01:49:01.831 --> 01:49:06.831
found on the bottom of the shoes that were in the garage of said caveman killer.

1795
01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:11.820
Further investigation in the vehicle would find more traces of that dirt on the

1796
01:49:11.821 --> 01:49:16.570
floor mats from the shoes and on the seat where the weapon was placed on the way

1797
01:49:16.571 --> 01:49:20.070
to the op,
the offing,
sorry to say Mr Cave.

1798
01:49:20.100 --> 01:49:23.610
Sorry to say Mister Caveman.
Game over.
Have Fun playing.

1799
01:49:23.611 --> 01:49:27.750
Hide the stick in prison over the next 50 years to life.

1800
01:49:28.410 --> 01:49:30.930
Jesus Christ.
You've got to give it up to that guy for breaking it down.

1801
01:49:30.931 --> 01:49:33.690
I know he's kind of a,
he was only semi-serious there.

1802
01:49:34.170 --> 01:49:36.570
He's talking about like those fucking a and e murder things.

1803
01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:38.310
Cause that's literally how people get caught.

1804
01:49:38.820 --> 01:49:41.430
Like Sasol one with this guy suffocated,
somebody with a,

1805
01:49:41.540 --> 01:49:46.200
with a trash bag and somehow they figured it out that that's how they did it.

1806
01:49:46.201 --> 01:49:50.080
And they were able to,
the impression of the woman's face in the bag.

1807
01:49:50.590 --> 01:49:54.520
It was one of the creepiest things ever.
And uh,
but I gotta tell you something,

1808
01:49:54.550 --> 01:49:56.470
you know,
I know you just half joking around,

1809
01:49:56.471 --> 01:49:58.780
but most of that shit's just circumstantial evidence.

1810
01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:02.470
And if you don't have the weapon,

1811
01:50:03.310 --> 01:50:07.390
all you have is all that guys to say what I like to go hiking in that area.

1812
01:50:09.130 --> 01:50:13.570
Yes,
I hiked in that area.
Yes,
my fibers worthy.
You know,

1813
01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:15.700
it's still all circumstantial at that point.

1814
01:50:15.701 --> 01:50:17.920
If you have no priors or anything like that,

1815
01:50:18.970 --> 01:50:21.600
that's a whole bunch of circumstantial evidence.
And I don't,
you know,

1816
01:50:21.601 --> 01:50:26.440
if you get a good lawyer,
you're going to get off,
you're going to get off.
Um,

1817
01:50:26.860 --> 01:50:29.410
and I think that's it for the Monday morning podcast this week.

1818
01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:33.250
Look at up to 54 minutes,
it happened again.
And I didn't,
you know,
why?

1819
01:50:33.490 --> 01:50:36.610
Cause the Goddamn fire trucks and I didn't even get a chance to get to the

1820
01:50:36.611 --> 01:50:40.810
underrated overrated yet.
Uh,
but you know,
these things are really building up,

1821
01:50:40.811 --> 01:50:44.920
so I got to blow through these,
uh,
okay.
Overrated.

1822
01:50:44.921 --> 01:50:46.120
Driving fast.

1823
01:50:46.930 --> 01:50:51.170
Not many things make me angrier on the road than when I'm driving 75 miles per

1824
01:50:51.171 --> 01:50:52.004
hour,
per hour.

1825
01:50:52.180 --> 01:50:56.740
And I'm getting tailgated really is 75 not fucking fast enough.

1826
01:50:56.741 --> 01:50:59.830
Few people,
you know,
something.
I,
you know,
I,

1827
01:50:59.831 --> 01:51:01.540
that really annoys the shit out of me too.

1828
01:51:01.690 --> 01:51:04.900
Sometimes I'll bump it up to 80 and people are still riding my ass.

1829
01:51:04.900 --> 01:51:05.740
What the fuck?

1830
01:51:06.340 --> 01:51:08.740
I can understand it and appreciate the need to get somewhere quickly,

1831
01:51:08.741 --> 01:51:09.201
but does that,

1832
01:51:09.201 --> 01:51:14.080
that doesn't mean that wherever you need to go is more important than my need to

1833
01:51:14.081 --> 01:51:17.080
arrive at my destination at one fucking piece.
Well,
that is true,

1834
01:51:17.200 --> 01:51:17.951
but you know something,

1835
01:51:17.951 --> 01:51:20.710
I got to argue for the other guy here that if somebody is riding your ass,

1836
01:51:20.711 --> 01:51:24.670
you really should get out of the way,
you know.
Um,

1837
01:51:24.970 --> 01:51:28.810
but I know that said whole guy thing,
then he feel like a bitch,
you know.

1838
01:51:28.811 --> 01:51:29.550
So what are you got to do?

1839
01:51:29.550 --> 01:51:34.360
You've got to stomp on the breaks and be a fucking asshole.
Um,
Bob,

1840
01:51:34.361 --> 01:51:37.360
really,
I got to admit though,
if you are doing 75 80 in the left lane,

1841
01:51:37.361 --> 01:51:40.870
somebody still riding your ass.
Uh,
I dunno.

1842
01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:43.700
When you get a little older and more relaxed,
you don't give a fuck.
You Do,

1843
01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:48.460
you do go over to the right like I do now and I'll say one out of 40 times you

1844
01:51:48.461 --> 01:51:48.881
do that,

1845
01:51:48.881 --> 01:51:51.670
you actually get to see the guy get a speeding ticket a little further down the

1846
01:51:51.671 --> 01:51:54.790
road.
But the other 39 times,

1847
01:51:54.820 --> 01:51:59.320
the other 39 times you feel like a bitch.
I gotta admit underrated,
quiet time.

1848
01:52:00.140 --> 01:52:02.350
I remember when we used to have quiet time in grade school.

1849
01:52:02.530 --> 01:52:03.850
I wish that was still around.

1850
01:52:04.060 --> 01:52:06.790
I work at a TV station and I liked the guys I work with,

1851
01:52:06.791 --> 01:52:10.330
but sometimes I just need everyone to shut the fuck up.

1852
01:52:10.900 --> 01:52:15.010
Do we have to be running our miles every goddamn second for the next eight
hours?

1853
01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:19.750
Just sit there and do your work for a bit.
We'll talk later.
Jesus.

1854
01:52:20.080 --> 01:52:22.630
You know what dude?
I totally fucking relate to.
Exactly.

1855
01:52:23.050 --> 01:52:26.140
Some people just don't like fucking silence.
You know,

1856
01:52:26.410 --> 01:52:30.910
they find it awkward and they got to keep running the mouse kind of like me for

1857
01:52:30.911 --> 01:52:32.760
the last fucking hour.
Jesus Christ.
All right.

1858
01:52:32.920 --> 01:52:36.700
Under rated TV show the deadliest warrior on Spike TV.

1859
01:52:37.210 --> 01:52:38.500
Just look this shit up.

1860
01:52:39.130 --> 01:52:43.600
It pits two different warriors together from different time eras and they see

1861
01:52:43.601 --> 01:52:48.080
who would win.
Dude,
that really sounds like some nerdy fucking shit.

1862
01:52:48.410 --> 01:52:51.800
Isn't that like,
what do you think would win an alligator or a shark?

1863
01:52:52.670 --> 01:52:56.540
I don't know who they would when Shabaka or spark.

1864
01:52:57.140 --> 01:52:59.450
I don't get into that shit,
but you know what?
God bless you sir.

1865
01:52:59.451 --> 01:53:03.740
There's people out there went to it.
So I guess,
you know,
go check it out.
Uh,

1866
01:53:03.741 --> 01:53:08.060
real quick.
Uh,
overrated women's intuition.
I've always heard educated,

1867
01:53:08.750 --> 01:53:12.950
intelligent women say that women's intuition is always correct.

1868
01:53:13.100 --> 01:53:15.890
Sorry you're wrong.
If that were true,

1869
01:53:15.891 --> 01:53:19.220
why do women repeatedly date abusive twisted guys?

1870
01:53:19.780 --> 01:53:21.830
Wouldn't their intuition tell them that the guy,

1871
01:53:22.700 --> 01:53:27.200
what the guy is like yet another reason of women patting themselves on the back

1872
01:53:27.201 --> 01:53:30.410
for no reason.
All right,
sir.
You know what?

1873
01:53:32.450 --> 01:53:37.400
Fuck that chick.
Okay.
Whoever dumped you just fuck her man.

1874
01:53:37.430 --> 01:53:39.470
You know there's going to be another good girl coming around.

1875
01:53:39.471 --> 01:53:42.990
Don't give into the bitterness.
Don't give into the paternal [inaudible]

1876
01:53:45.530 --> 01:53:47.870
or maybe that's just from dating for a while because there's a lot of,

1877
01:53:47.930 --> 01:53:50.780
there's a major part in me to really like that email yet.

1878
01:53:50.781 --> 01:53:54.080
Another example of women patting themselves on the back for no reason.

1879
01:53:54.470 --> 01:53:57.950
Jesus Christ.
If that sentence doesn't describe the Oprah Winfrey show,

1880
01:53:57.951 --> 01:54:02.900
I don't know what does.
Um,
great.
Great one.
All right,
here we go.
Uh,
in women,

1881
01:54:02.901 --> 01:54:04.520
if you're sitting there getting mad,
you can,

1882
01:54:04.850 --> 01:54:07.940
you can always fucking trash guys cause I'll read them.

1883
01:54:08.180 --> 01:54:11.510
I'll definitely read them and I know we deserve it.
All right,
number two,

1884
01:54:11.540 --> 01:54:16.040
Disney movies.
Okay,
I'm 35 years old now,
but uh,

1885
01:54:16.130 --> 01:54:17.180
even as a kid,

1886
01:54:17.450 --> 01:54:21.470
I thought those a sugary shit movies suck bloody balls.

1887
01:54:22.420 --> 01:54:26.660
All right dude.
If I can wait and let me know how you feel.
Overrated.

1888
01:54:26.661 --> 01:54:29.740
Interlocking lives.
Interlocking lives.

1889
01:54:29.750 --> 01:54:33.770
Movies like crash and fast food nation.
Get it.

1890
01:54:34.250 --> 01:54:36.860
We're all connected.
This shit is getting old.

1891
01:54:37.100 --> 01:54:41.350
That movie crash was so fucking overrated.
So fucking,

1892
01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:43.340
and that's one of those movies just cause it was about race.

1893
01:54:43.341 --> 01:54:47.480
People thought that it was saying something.
A question number four,

1894
01:54:47.481 --> 01:54:51.830
the movie stir crazy.
I love Richard Pryor.
He was one of the best ever.

1895
01:54:51.831 --> 01:54:54.920
But this movie is average.

1896
01:54:55.130 --> 01:54:58.700
His talent is pretty much wasted on this film.
Yeah,

1897
01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:03.200
I would have to say that.
Is that the one where they walk into the,
into the jail,

1898
01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:07.100
you know that's right.
Ah,
we bad.
We bet.

1899
01:55:07.130 --> 01:55:10.490
That's like the funniest part of the movie and I don't know.

1900
01:55:11.330 --> 01:55:13.070
I have would have to agree with you.
That's it though guys.

1901
01:55:13.071 --> 01:55:17.000
I'm actually coming up on a fucking hour here.
59 minutes,
25 seconds.
Listen,

1902
01:55:17.210 --> 01:55:18.080
that's the podcast.

1903
01:55:18.081 --> 01:55:21.440
You guys all have a great memorial day and I really should have made this one

1904
01:55:21.441 --> 01:55:24.080
short so you could actually enjoy your memorial day,
but you know what?

1905
01:55:24.180 --> 01:55:27.710
You got the whole week to listen to it.
And if you listen to this on Tuesday,

1906
01:55:27.711 --> 01:55:29.780
that means you're back at that fucking job you hate,

1907
01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:34.220
and I just killed an hour for you.
So God bless.
All right,
have a great week.
