00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
Now, before we go deeper into the algorithm,

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.710
let's just make sure that you understand the problem that Alice has to work on.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.210
So let's take this very simple communications network here,

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.680
and what I would like you to do is to figure out the minimum number of devices

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.250
that would need to be installed in this network in order to monitor the whole network.

00:00:19.250 --> 99:59:59.000
And please enter your answer as a number in here.
