Video cameras were new

00:00:02.234 --> 00:00:04.904 align:start position:0%
and we were v-very excited
about the technology.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.172 align:start size:91% position:9%
You don't have to explain
yourself to nobody.

00:00:07.239 --> 00:00:08.575 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Thank you.
- Alright, here it is.

(Big Mike on TV)
Alright, on me.

00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:14.214
I love you, Brenda.
One, two, three!

00:00:15.848 --> 00:00:17.449
[bleep]

00:00:17.516 --> 00:00:18.785
Aah!

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:19.786

[gunfire]

00:00:22.622 --> 00:00:23.890
Oh, my God! Aah!

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:28.161
Aah! Aah! Oh, my God!

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:31.331
Aah! Aah! Aah!

00:00:37.703 --> 00:00:39.539
Wow.

00:00:48.647 --> 00:00:50.083
[chuckles]

'Never came to work again.'

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:52.985
- Never came to work again.
- Never came to work again.

00:00:53.052 --> 00:00:54.220
That was it.

00:00:55.421 --> 00:00:56.956
What do you think, Jonesy?

00:00:57.022 --> 00:00:59.592 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Not a bad look, huh?
- 'Kind of good.'

00:00:59.658 --> 00:01:01.694
Kind of good, in fact.

00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:04.129
'I don't remember this.'

00:01:04.196 --> 00:01:05.865
Where's Trudy?

00:01:05.932 --> 00:01:08.768 align:start size:78% position:22%
- Oh, no!
- Oh, my God, no!

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:10.469
Oh, god, no!

00:01:10.536 --> 00:01:11.971
'Oh, my god, no!'

(Williams)
'Itching gas!'

00:01:13.706 --> 00:01:14.707 align:start size:78% position:22%
Come on! Come on!
Get her out!

00:01:14.774 --> 00:01:18.377
Oh, God, no! No!

00:01:18.444 --> 00:01:19.679
No!

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:21.414
Goddamn it!

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:22.782
You live, woman.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.553 align:start size:88% position:13%
Goddamn it.
You live, Trudy Wiegel!

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:30.055 align:start position:0%
Oh. Okay. Wait.

00:01:30.122 --> 00:01:32.058 align:start position:0%
Okay. Okay. Okay.

00:01:32.124 --> 00:01:33.860
You're fine.
You're okay.

00:01:33.926 --> 00:01:35.995
She's alive.
She's alive.

00:01:36.062 --> 00:01:37.330 align:start size:72% position:28%
- Mmm.
- She's alive.

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:41.234 align:start size:56% position:44%
Is this a surprise
party for me?

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:44.970
She was dead for 14 minutes.

00:01:45.037 --> 00:01:47.306 align:start size:75% position:25%
Oh, that'll kill a brain
right there, yeah.

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:49.008
Shouldn't have revived her.

00:01:49.075 --> 00:01:50.509
Nope. That's what
the doctor said.

00:01:50.576 --> 00:01:52.278 align:start size:88% position:13%
The doctor said
should have let her go.

00:01:52.344 --> 00:01:54.680 align:start size:94% position:6%
It's like if Marilyn Monroe
had woken up from those

00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:57.917 align:start size:97% position:3%
sleeping pills and become
a dribbling, farting [bleep].

00:01:57.984 --> 00:02:00.253
Why are they showing
this on TV right now?
