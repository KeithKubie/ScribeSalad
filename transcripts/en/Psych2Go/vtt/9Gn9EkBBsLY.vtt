00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.270
Accepting that things can simply turn out good for you can be a difficult task,

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.350
especially if you have a lot of cultural and psychological baggage in the way.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.869
Some seemingly simple and small things could interfere in our path to guilt-free happiness.

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:32.529
Nowadays, the pressure of being happy or getting away with a good opportunity is enormous. To better understand

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.229
what happens in our brain during a happy event and how we sabotage ourselves during the acceptance of a fortunate event,

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.479
we talked with PhD Christine Ba Cho and got a few answers for these unsettling questions:

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.960
According to one of your articles people tend to associate guilt with certain pleasant events,

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.349
but they can develop certain habits to maintain a positive mindset.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.559
You said being happy for the sake of others rather than for ourselves can break a cycle of anxiety and unhappiness.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.080
Could the feeling of empathy be associated with guilt-free happiness and create awareness within a community?

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:15.279
People may associate guilt with certain pleasant event because they feel is unfair or inappropriate for them to be happy when others are suffering;

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.470
when a loved one is battling a critical illness or has died in a tragic way

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.179
we may think being happy would be a sign of disloyalty. In a loving relationship

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:30.339
it's important to share your feelings and experiences so we yearn to experience what they're

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.348
experiencing in an effort to keep them beside us even if it means sacrificing our own happiness.

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:38.319
However, in a healthy relationship,

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:44.409
each person wants the other to be content, so letting ourselves be happy is what a loved one would wish for. You

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.539
may desire to suffer in their place

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.458
but of course, that's not possible. So, our role is to help them cope and bring happiness to them.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.910
By being happy for others and understanding the real value of joy, you can break the cycle of negative emotions.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:07.000
Happiness is more than a solitary experience, it's contagious. And feeling empathy for others allows us to help them move beyond the difficulties.

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:18.548
Why do people tend to abandon logic when undergoing changes in life? Are emotions generally a bigger decision-maker for us?

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:29.319
Emotions are regulated by different dynamics and different brain mechanisms, biological thinking follow rules and lead to productive conclusions.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.769
Emotion can influence our decisions for better or for worse.

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:40.359
Even when we believe that choices are based on logic, oftentimes those choices are also affected by emotional bias

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.530
because the emotional attachment govern preference and perceived importance.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:53.260
Also, many people believe that life choices shouldn't be decided purely on logic, take for example, marriage. Most would prefer to

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.129
choose their partners using their emotions rather than using utilitarian logic.

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.798
How can optimistic and joyful people directly influence those suffering from depression or anxiety?

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.479
Being optimistic allows the person to see a wider variety of options and

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:21.220
recognizes more opportunities for growth, success, and increasing the chances of feeling happy. Being open to new experiences

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.349
can help overcome the sense of helplessness the stems from depression and anxiety.

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:29.349
While it takes time and practice,

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:32.709
following an optimistic attitude can ultimately help

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.660
someone experience small successes that lead to greater personal growth and life satisfication.

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:43.149
Joy is contagious and changes the way others interact with us.

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:49.539
Others are likely to spend more time with, and respond more positively to us, when they share our happiness;

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.349
having a positive attitude and healthier social

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.469
interaction can break the cycle of depression and replace it with a cycle of more positive emotions.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.730
Why do superstitions like Karma guide our fear of feeling happy?

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:17.369
Karma is one example of a belief that's understood differently in various cultures, in a society that doesn't fault the

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:25.050
fundamental philosophy behind it, the idea is often applied simply to convey a deeper universal human need for order.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.989
Notions of randomness, luck and chance are threatened to our psychological well-being,

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.189
because they suggest that we will never be in full control of our lives.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.189
Consequently, we seek to impose orders, especially during chaotic or stressful times.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.350
Misunderstanding situations that are governed by chance such as gambling,

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.759
reinforced by variable awards, can lead to unhealthy behaviors.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.950
Young people nowadays are more connected than any previous generation.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:07.020
How can this asset be useful in transforming the world around us, especially with the growing number of anxiety disorders in that age group?

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.679
Being socially connected is the essential to psychological well-being.

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:21.540
Many Millennials are more connected to their families than prior generations as they take a longer to buy their own homes. They

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:27.779
have also benefited from social media and smartphones which has mixed impact on them; on one hand,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.940
there's a possibility of being able to reach out for emotional and practical support anytime.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.970
But, on the other, being constantly connected can impose stress and lead to anxiety disorders.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:47.100
People's behavior on social media tend to be more extreme than in real life, leading to events such as cyber bullying and invasion of privacy.

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:55.109
Generally, for many young people, constant connection means always being on-call with no alone time for themselves.

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:00.989
But they are learning to use technology in constructive ways whether it's befriending people from diverse

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.780
backgrounds or keeping in touch with distant friends.

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:09.749
Additionally, they are able to use the internet to expand the impact of pro-social effort from

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.010
fundraising for worthy causes to raising awareness for important issues.

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:23.250
