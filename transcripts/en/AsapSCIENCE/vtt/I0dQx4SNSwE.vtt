00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:05.210
*YAWN* Almost all animals with a spine yawn.
Penguins do it as a mating ritual, snakes

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.760
do it to realign their jaws after a meal and
guinea pigs do it to display anger. So, why

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.410
exactly do humans yawn? And is yawning actually
contagious?

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.030
If you haven't already checked out our YAWN-O-METER video, click here, or use the link in the

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.980
description, to see how long you can last
before yawning. If you're anything like us,

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.550
you may have even yawned at the title of this
video.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.650
The truth is, the first time you yawned was
likely as a fetus. Babies begin to yawn during

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.449
the second trimester, and though the reason
why is still unknown, it may have to do with

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:36.460
proper brain development. In adults, yawns
were commonly thought to draw more oxygen

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.600
into the lungs making you feel less tired,
but new research states this may not be the

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.190
case.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.649
Scientist now believe that yawning has developed
as a way of physiologically cooling your brain.

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.260
Much like a computer, your brain works best
at a certain temperature, and tries to avoid

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.489
"overheating". And it turns out yawning increases
your heart rate, blood flow and the use of

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.579
muscles in your face which are all essential
to cooling the brain. On top of that, deeply

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.149
inhaling cold air can alter the temperature
of the blood in our head.

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:05.110
But why is your brain hot in the first place?
Well, both exhaustion and sleep deprivation

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.859
are known to increase overall brain temperature,
which explains why yawning occurs more in

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:13.999
these states. Researches have even found participants
who place warm packs on their head yawn 41%

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:18.709
of the time while watching others yawn, as
opposed to 9% of the time with a cold pack on their head.

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:23.450
So if your head is already cold, you'll yawn
less. But what about contagious or social

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.909
yawning?

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.029
Humans, primates and even dogs find yawning
contagious, and it's most likely linked to

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:32.740
empathy. Contagious yawning begins in children
around the age of 4-5, and this is when empathetic

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.240
behaviour, along with the ability to identify
emotions, begins to develop. In fact, children

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.590
with empathy-related disorders, such as autism,
yawn less in response to videos of people

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.329
yawning compared to other children. Research
also suggests that you are more likely to

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.590
copy the yawn of someone socially or genetically
close to you. Even dogs are more likely to

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.840
copy the yawns of their owner as opposed to
the yawn of a stranger.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.959
Finally, mirror neurons also play a role.
In our brain, mirror neurons fire when we

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:01.130
perform specific actions, view someone else
doing the action or even just hear someone

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.520
talk about the action. They are important
brain cells that are used for learning, self-awareness

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.080
and relating to others. When we view someone
else yawn, the mirror neurons in our brain

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.250
become activated in a similar way, and as
a result we copy the yawn.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.170
So although yawning may occur in people who
are literally "hot headed", contagious yawning

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.430
allows us to be cool with the people around
us.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.200
