00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.240
SPEAKER: So Mr. O'Glove
is a Wall Street veteran

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.410
known for pioneering red
flag deviation analyses,

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.490
and he's the author of
"Quality of Earnings--

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.160
The Investor's Guide to Figure
Out How Much Money a Company

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.050
Is Really Making."

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.880
His work is amongst
the must-reads

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.730
by industry icons including
Tom Gardner of the Motley Fool

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.410
and on Cuppy's book list as one
of the top financial accounting

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.870
books of all time.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.690
I could go on and
on about the book,

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.310
but this talk is about him.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.070
Over to you, sir.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.130
Thank you so much.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.000
THORNTON L. O'GLOVE:
Boy, [? Surum, ?] I

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.640
really thank you
for your patience.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.720
So much time putting
this together.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.140
All of you taking time out
from lunch to come here.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.985
My family, and when I look at
some of the personages that

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:56.390
have been here-- Barack Obama,
Hillary Clinton, Nassim Taleb,

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.270
"The Black Swan,"
it goes on and on.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.770
I sort of feel like a
pygmy in their company.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.440
And as I tell you later when
I get to Berkshire Hathaway,

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.040
if Houdini can come
back to life and wave

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.220
a magic wand as a
financial magician,

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.120
it would be great for Warren
Buffett to come out here

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.080
and for me to debate
Warren Buffet on what

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.710
he's not going to do.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.920
We're talking about
disassembling all the company.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.760
All 90 operating companies
will be spun off tax-free

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.340
to shareholders.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.770
The $360 billion market
cap here, again, it's

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.170
like waving a magic wand.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.350
It'll go up to a
trillion dollars,

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.710
but I'll go more into this
and the mind of Warren Buffett

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.860
and why he chooses this path
of acquiring and continuing

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.970
to conglomerate, rather
than deconglomerate.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.780
And a little bit more
about my background,

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.420
I was born and raised
in San Francisco,

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.260
got a BA from San
Francisco State, an MBA

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.690
from the University of
California-Berkeley.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.260
I was a stockbroker
for a number of years.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.980
When I was a stockbroker, I
used to read these prospectuses.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.160
My specialty was selling
new offerings by prospectus,

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.970
and the prospectus had about
120 pages of dense content.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.510
I was the only one in
the office that bothered

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.170
to read the prospectus.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.850
So that gave me the idea to
become a security analyst,

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.440
and I left the
brokerage business

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.210
to go two years University
of California-Berkeley,

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.220
and that really helped me
get more of a base and so on.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.350
And then I went
on to Wall Street.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.130
I worked for a
couple of firms and I

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.210
got the idea--
I'll tell you where

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.450
I got the idea of this
"Quality of Earnings" report.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.060
This book really changed
my life in the future.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.590
The "Quality of Earnings" report
was an institutional report

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.362
for professional investors,
banks, mutual funds,

00:02:58.362 --> 00:02:59.195
investment advisers.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.260
Now we'll go on to what
this presentation is about.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.950
Part one, financial
deviation analysis,

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.630
the "Quality of Earnings" book.

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.850
What I like about the book is
knowing financial analysis,

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.880
but it can help your mind
look for financial deviations

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.120
and other deviations.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.150
One of my hobbies is I
can't pick up a paper

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.240
without seeing either a
positive or negative deviation

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.110
from the norm.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.870
In part two, investing
50 years in the market,

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.530
I wish I could have
some of the years

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.820
back what I know now about the
stock market with hindsight.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.840
And this is why when I see
my eye doctor, he says,

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.530
you have perfect
20-20 rear vision,

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.970
but not so much foresight.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.510
And talk about the best pathway,
and I kind of prove this out.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.280
It's very simple.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.570
You know, I know all
these investors come here,

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.520
mutual funds, Howard
Marks was here.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.160
They all have their own ideas
how to invest and so on.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.170
And then part three
is the bonanza.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.360
Only after Warren Buffett
leaves the scene will

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.459
the corporation
change dramatically.

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.390
Even though he's got it all
figured out in his mind,

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.000
he doesn't want it changing.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.990
But I'll explain why
this is going to happen.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.190
So going on to part one
now, I came across a book

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.950
all the way back in the 1950s,
"How to Lie With Statistics."

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.660
Everyone should read this.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.460
It was written by Darrell Huff.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.760
It's sold over two million
copies since the mid-'50s.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.200
It's still in print.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.260
And here's what he says.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.610
Basically, you can
take this to the bank.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.760
"Rarely you live through a
day without having statistics

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.340
forced on you by radio,
television, billboard,

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.540
or newspaper.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.250
This book will keep
you from being fooled.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.480
Read it and discover which
statistic is the phony."

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.800
And by the way, you almost
cannot pick up a newspaper,

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.910
and you will not see some
example of rigged statistics.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.500
It may involve
school grades, maybe

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.920
even involve how many ships
are in the US military,

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:23.100
how many Special Forces
are really in Iraq,

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.743
because they don't
count the number who

00:05:24.743 --> 00:05:27.740
are going to go on rotation,
so they leave out 1,000.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.750
That's another way of
rigging statistics.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.000
And I love this
quote by Disraeli,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.990
the Victorian prime
minister of England.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.470
He said, "There are three kinds
of lies-- lies, damn lies,

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:40.740
and statistics."

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.590
And then the famous H.G. Wells
said, "Statistical thinking

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.064
one day will be as necessary
for efficient citizenship

00:05:47.064 --> 00:05:48.480
as the ability to
read and write."

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.300
Well, that's never
happened, never will happen.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.540
Always remember, whenever you
look at statistics, a contract,

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.080
whatever's handed you in
the form of statistics,

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.250
the presenter has
the upper hand.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.230
Everyone has a bias.

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.160
So the Department of Labor
has a bias in keeping down

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.580
the inflation rate.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.510
The inflation rate,
they claim, is 2%.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.100
It's nowhere near 2%.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.150
I wish Janet Yellen
could come here

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.590
for 30 seconds, the head of
the Federal Reserve, and I say,

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.370
I don't think you eat food.

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:23.495
I don't think you pay rent.

00:06:23.495 --> 00:06:25.700
You don't have any
medical expense.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.730
You don't have any
tuition expense,

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:30.740
because you say the
tuition's only 2%.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.860
The real rate of inflation
runs 5% or 6% right now.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.600
That's the real rate.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:41.590
The deficit, you'll read
a $500 billion deficit.

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.360
The deficit's not $500 billion.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.150
The current deficit in the
last 12 months is $1 trillion.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.530
It's very simple to know
what the deficit is.

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:53.520
It's the increase in government
debt over a period of time.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.730
But the way the government
keeps the statistics,

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.560
their definition
of today's deficit

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.900
is one half of the true deficit.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.790
Just to give you a few
more examples of this,

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:09.010
now Nate Silver has
come here to talk.

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:12.270
This is a book that
I think everyone

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:16.880
should read, from the president
of the United States on down.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.050
People in command,
the head of the FBI,

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.850
you name it, the higher up
you are in a corporation

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.150
or whatever you're doing,
you should read this book,

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.580
because so many
signals are missed.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.220
And Nate Silver
is a genius, first

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.510
of all as an amateur pollster.

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:38.170
In 2012 he's the only
one that predicted

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:42.159
every state that would
vote for Obama and Romney.

00:07:42.159 --> 00:07:42.700
The only one.

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:44.550
He was an amateur.

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.390
I'm just going to read
this part here briefly.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:48.760
You see on the board.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.850
"'The Signal and the Noise,'
he examines the world

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:51.597
of prediction."

00:07:51.597 --> 00:07:53.680
By the way, talking about
the world of prediction,

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.920
if you heard Nassim Taleb come
here, he mocks predictors.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.440
He says they're all
wearing empty suits.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:04.140
They don't tell you what
their real track record is.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:09.430
And also Warren Buffett,
he makes few predictions

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:11.380
but the few he make come true.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:16.340
But at the annual meeting, he'll
say everyone loves predictions.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.480
They like to make predictions.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.380
And the kings of old
hired soothsayers

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:24.060
to tell their fortune.

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:26.990
Now he says, "Many predictions
fail, often at great cost

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:30.500
to society, because we
have a poor understanding

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.220
of probability and uncertainty."

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:35.299
That's also what
Nassim Taleb goes into.

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:38.260
"We are wired to
detect a signal and we

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.360
mistake more
confident predictions

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.310
for more accurate ones."

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:49.620
The noise-- there's never
been more noise ever

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:52.270
in trying to make predictions,
and the reason there

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:56.160
are so many mixed signals--
you see, the internet is great.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.630
The internet-- however, the
negative on the internet

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:02.259
is there's way too much noise.

00:09:02.259 --> 00:09:04.050
And I was just reading
the "New York Post."

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:05.300
I can't believe the statistic.

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.160
They said the average
worker in tech

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:12.720
and so on spends six hours
a day retrieving emails.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:17.990
And my son here-- who's
assistant DA at the district

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:20.930
attorney's office, he's head
of the criminal division--

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:22.940
my guess is he spends
three hours a day

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:26.070
just on collecting emails.

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:31.000
So what happens is you
get all these emails, all

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.030
this overloading information.

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:36.440
You're searching for all
this different information.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.630
There's so much texting.

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:42.660
This is why somebody who can
train themselves a la Nate

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:48.120
Silver to look for the signals
that count will be ahead

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.120
of their competitors.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.830
Now what are three
great missed signals

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:54.680
among the many recently?

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:59.550
Bernard Madoff, the
greatest Ponzi scheme ever.

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:03.030
He claimed he was managing
billions of dollars,

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:05.920
and he'd give you a
10% steady return,

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.860
and people would
beg him to invest.

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:12.810
And he said, I have a-- They
would say, what is your method?

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:15.780
He would say, I have
a proprietary method.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.310
If you already had
money with him,

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:19.650
he said, I'll send
you a check tomorrow

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.130
if you don't want me
to manage your money.

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:25.730
And if you don't like
the way I can't tell you

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:28.960
exactly how I manage all
these billions of dollars

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.280
to give you a 10% return
no matter what the bond

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.510
market does, no matter what
the stock market's doing,

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:34.910
you're getting a 10%.

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:39.050
And that's how he got so
many, you might say suckers,

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:40.610
to invest with him.

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:43.515
But nobody, including the
SEC, and the missed signal

00:10:43.515 --> 00:10:45.800
was, who were his accountants?

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.520
You've got to realize Bernard
Madoff was very well known

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.800
on Wall Street.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.955
He was president of the
National Association

00:10:51.955 --> 00:10:54.210
of Security Dealers.

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:56.910
He was under
oversight of the SEC.

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:59.570
They would come in,
inspect his office.

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:02.910
Some investors invested over
a billion dollars with him,

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:05.560
but none of them
interviewed his accountant.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.120
And who were the accountants?

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.990
Nobody in the world
ever heard of these

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:13.430
two accountants up in a
strip mall, upstate New York.

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:15.000
Nobody ever heard of them.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.850
If they investigate
the accountants,

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:19.790
then what they would
have done is how on earth

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:23.460
can this man of his stature
and managing so much money

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:25.090
have accountants
nobody ever heard of?

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:27.980
You'd almost have to have one
of the big four accountants

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:32.040
that handle most of
the corporation audits.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:37.500
So this-- that was
the real signal

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:41.560
where he could have been
apprehended years before.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.130
Now we come to Enron Corp.
This is one of the biggest

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:45.220
accounting scandals ever.

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:46.920
You remember Enron Corp?

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.680
The lights went
out in California

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.900
and they were gaming the system.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:54.880
Enron, if you wanted to
invest in an energy company,

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.430
that was the way of going.

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:57.690
The company's stock skyrocket.

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:04.050
The last year they reported
earnings, they only earned $1.

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:06.000
They were selling at
100 times earnings,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.270
which is a very high multiple.

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:09.964
There were so many red flags.

00:12:09.964 --> 00:12:11.630
Looking through the
annual report alone,

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:14.570
there were dozens of red flags.

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:18.560
And one red flag was
off-balance-sheet entities.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:23.850
These are entities that are
not part of the annual report

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:26.830
that you can look
at, and all the SEC

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:31.150
had to do when they used to
look at their financials,

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:33.410
just ask for a separate
income statement balance

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:36.440
sheet of these
entities, and they

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:40.340
would have saw they
were hiding the losses.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:44.450
They had three sets of books--
one for the shareholder,

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:49.140
the other for the IRS,
and the third set of books

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:51.500
was these off-balance-sheet
entities that

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:54.100
became more and more
notorious, and that's

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:55.440
where the real losses.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:00.490
The losses in these
offshore-balance-sheet entities

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:04.630
hid the fraudulent gains.

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:09.970
Another one, interesting.

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:11.360
Derivatives.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.880
Nobody listened
to Warren Buffett.

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.030
This is a case of
Warren Buffett making

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:16.460
one of his famous predictions.

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:19.750
In 2003, in the annual
report, he said,

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:22.520
derivatives will become
weapons of mass destruction,

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.400
financial mass destruction.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.530
I heard him on the
Charlie Rose program.

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:29.400
Charlie Rose said, well,
how do you know so sure?

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:34.360
Remember this is four years
before the derivatives busted

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:38.250
corporate America-- I mean
busted the banks and so on.

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:42.110
And they all had to be
saved by the government.

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:45.800
He said, I bought general
reinsurance not too long ago.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.800
They were loaded with
toxic derivatives.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.900
It took me a couple years to
get rid of the derivatives.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:53.680
He writes the most famous
shareholder letter.

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.590
It's about 20 pages.

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:57.840
There's never ever been a
shareholder's letter written

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.990
before and never will
be one afterwards.

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:01.210
It's so informative.

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:03.590
It goes into a lot more than
just Berkshire Hathaway.

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:05.423
In this case he's talking
about derivatives.

00:14:05.423 --> 00:14:07.030
Well, who wasn't listening?

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:10.410
Alan Greenspan, the
Federal Reserve.

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:14.710
Rubin, secretary of state.

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:17.260
Bill Clinton, if
you Google him up

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.190
you'll see where he says
he made a mistake by not

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:23.750
having derivatives regulated.

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:25.770
However, he didn't know
anything about them.

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:31.000
In the case of Rubin,
after destruction

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.830
with the derivatives he
said it took him eight hours

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:38.030
to talk to accountants
to even begin to unwind.

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:42.510
They purposely were obtuse
and hard to explain.

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:44.570
So that's another thing in life.

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:46.230
They give you a
contract or whatever

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:48.450
they give you, and
hand in front of you,

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:52.610
or a new way of
computing, and this

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:54.730
is supposed to really help you.

00:14:54.730 --> 00:15:00.402
The more dense and obtuse
it is, just be on guard.

00:15:00.402 --> 00:15:02.110
Now we're on to the
"Quality of Earnings"

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:06.800
book, came out all
the way back in 1987.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:11.470
And if I hadn't read about
the "Lying With Statistics,"

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:14.250
because that's what
accounting's all about-- lying

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:16.840
with accounting legally.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:22.090
Once in a while my partner Bob
[? Osteen ?] and I used to say,

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:24.760
you know, there isn't
that much fraud.

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:27.990
They start with marijuana and
then they'll go on to heroin.

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:29.880
When they go on to
heroin, accounting-wise,

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:35.320
that's when everything breaks
up, like Enron, WorldCom,

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.760
you know, these big
accounting scandals.

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:42.260
But what you can do with the
generally-accepted accounting--

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.355
and don't forget you
pay the accountant.

00:15:44.355 --> 00:15:46.400
The accountant is paid by you.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:50.095
He will work as close
as he can to you.

00:15:50.095 --> 00:15:52.380
You may know him socially.

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:56.850
In the case of Enron's
auditor, this big auditor,

00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:59.520
Arthur Andersen, one of
the most famous auditors,

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.210
was a runaway audit.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:05.016
They went far beyond the
bounds they should have.

00:16:05.016 --> 00:16:09.220
They should have given
Enron a classified

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:11.610
opinion, a qualified opinion.

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:15.580
It was so bad, and
Arthur Andersen

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:19.670
had been warned a few
years about another audits,

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:21.630
so the government went
after them in civil.

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:23.950
They actually closed them down.

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:26.140
The company had 50,000,
60,000 employees.

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:27.979
They-- and what's
interesting is you

00:16:27.979 --> 00:16:30.020
would have made a lot of
money on Arthur Anderson

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:39.380
through a center, because they
had what they call a advice.

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:41.460
They give advice
to corporations,

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:45.260
and the center went public,
and stock's up about 12 to 1

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:46.280
since it went public.

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:48.250
That was a great
buy, because all you

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:50.550
were buying-- you weren't
buying accounting now,

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:56.920
you're just buying advice
like McKinsley gives.

00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:00.820
Here we go again on the
points of the analysts.

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:01.990
The analysts are trapped.

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:03.540
They've got to be bullish.

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:06.079
If they're negative,
they may lose their job.

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:09.949
The corporation may shut
them out of seminars.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.990
Most of them are involved
with underwriting.

00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:19.707
That's why they-- the company
will call up the research firm

00:17:19.707 --> 00:17:21.290
and they'll say, no
more underwriting,

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:23.206
so if you don't either
get rid of the analysts

00:17:23.206 --> 00:17:24.540
or silence them.

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:28.590
Trump personally fired
an analyst years ago.

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:33.290
Don Trump, the Taj Mahal
Casino, they issued

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:37.290
bonds that were very risky.

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:40.270
And this analyst-- I
still remember his name.

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:42.520
No, I remember where he
was from-- Roth Securities

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.800
in Philadelphia,
entertainment firm.

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.360
And he said, the bonds
are fraught with risk.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.690
Within one week he was gone.

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:56.420
Trump called his-- the
head of the firm and said,

00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:58.340
I'm liable to sue you.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:02.419
By the way, he has been
involved in 2,000 suits, one way

00:18:02.419 --> 00:18:02.960
or the other.

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:05.030
He holds the world
record with suits.

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:07.680
Either he's been sued
or he's suing you.

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.540
And he threatened, of
course, to sue the firm,

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:14.460
and the firm had a weak backbone
and they fired the analyst.

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:17.590
The auditor's reports
may not be reliable,

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:21.280
as the financial
operations are very complex

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.470
and there's a lot of leeway.

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:24.905
You've got thousands
of pages of regulation.

00:18:24.905 --> 00:18:29.950
You've got the SEC-- remember
the more thousands of pages

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:33.080
there are, and also dictum, the
more you can game the system.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.205
So the bottom line
is a corporation

00:18:35.205 --> 00:18:36.580
can tell the
accountant to either

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:40.630
be aggressive, not fraudulent,
middle of the road,

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:42.500
or conservative.

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.950
Somewhat similar is
the IRS tax code.

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:49.040
It only has 85,000
pages now since 1913.

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:52.450
It came from a couple pages,
now it's 85,000 pages.

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:54.190
So you read about
these corporations,

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:56.635
and they're dodging tax,
they're doing this or that.

00:18:56.635 --> 00:18:57.760
Well, you can't blame them.

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.050
They've got 85,000
pages to work with.

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:01.920
A lot of it's a gray area.

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:05.700
And here again, they're
paying the accountant

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:11.330
to eliminate as many
taxes as they can.

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:15.940
The chief executive's annual
letters, very interesting.

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:19.690
If you own a stock and you read
the annual report each year,

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:22.340
the president's letter
might constantly

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:25.560
make predictions that go astray.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.650
So there is a stock you
wouldn't want to own.

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:30.109
Or they'll be very
bullish as usual,

00:19:30.109 --> 00:19:31.650
but in the back of
the annual report,

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:33.860
you look at the
financials and so on

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:36.710
and you'll see the company,
the quality of earnings

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:38.680
is deteriorating.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:42.140
The future doesn't look good,
using the own financials

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:42.710
in the back.

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:45.250
In other words, a positive
picture in the front, weak

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:47.220
financials in the back.

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:52.020
You have income that may be
recurring or non-recurring, one

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:52.520
time.

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:56.646
The emphasis is to
emphasize income.

00:19:56.646 --> 00:19:58.020
If you need to
pad your earnings,

00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:01.530
emphasize the
non-recurring income.

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:04.380
The recurring income
comes automatically.

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:09.080
And by the way, Trump-- there
was an article on Trump years

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:13.790
ago on one of his companies,
where he was flagged down

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:21.330
by the SEC for overemphasizing
non-recurring event

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:25.220
in his presentation,
a presentation

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:27.270
of preliminary earnings.

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:28.700
Now here's a good one.

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:31.330
They have-- don't forget, the
corporation has the shareholder

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:33.070
books, they have the tax books.

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:36.320
The tax books are a
lot more conservative.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:37.940
They're conservative.

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:41.000
They take higher
depreciation expense

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.430
than they do for
shareholder expense.

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:50.770
They may be writing off expenses
immediately for shareholder

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:53.010
reporting-- no,
for tax reporting,

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:54.670
but not for
shareholder reporting.

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:58.310
The bigger the gap between
the shareholder earnings

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:03.310
and the tax earnings, the
lower the quality of earnings.

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:06.420
This footnote is
deliberately obtuse.

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:08.180
It's hard to read.

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:11.160
You may need an accountant
to explain it to you.

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.970
And this is self-evident.

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:16.880
The higher the accounts
receivable-- one red flag that

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:19.860
comes up very quick, when the
receivables or inventories

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:24.064
really start advancing
quickly in relation to sales,

00:21:24.064 --> 00:21:26.480
that's almost a dead giveaway
that company sales are going

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:29.230
to slow down ahead of time.

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:32.130
They may change the way
they report earnings.

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:35.636
They may start accelerating
revenue faster than they were.

00:21:35.636 --> 00:21:41.380
They may start capitalizing
expenses like software.

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:44.320
Enron, the last year they were
in business is interesting.

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.990
They earned $1, up from $0.90.

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:48.820
The whole dime
increase in earnings

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:51.190
came from capitalized
software, the first time they

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:52.650
were capitalizing software.

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:56.120
A large corporation like
that's not able to do it,

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.980
but you seldom do it.

00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:00.450
But they needed that
dime desperately,

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:03.060
so the whole
increase in earnings

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:05.760
came from capitalized software,
which the investors, of course,

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:06.590
ignored.

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:09.290
Now the big bath-- this
can be very bullish,

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:11.904
and Hewlett Packard
is a poster child.

00:22:11.904 --> 00:22:13.320
Hewlett Packard,
by the way, never

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.790
stops laying off employees.

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:19.390
Carly Fiorina came-- Carly
Fiorina laid off thousands--

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:21.630
tens of thousands of employees.

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:25.920
Whitman took over, laying
off thousands of employees.

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:29.000
I pity the people working
for Hewlett Packard.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.310
What they do is they'll
take a big bath.

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:41.210
They'll write off inventory,
accounts receivable, reserves.

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:43.650
In the case of the
$9 billion company

00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:48.130
they got stuck with, that
they bought in England--

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:49.490
and it's interesting.

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:52.240
They bought a $9
billion company,

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.550
and their own accountants
look at the books--

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:58.300
this shows you how difficult
it is to see accounting fraud--

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:01.550
and they also hired English
forensic accountants to go over

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:03.000
the books.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.670
They bought the company.

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:07.340
Shortly later a
whistleblower comes, not

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:09.430
from the accountants,
a whistleblower

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:13.650
tells Hewlett Packard,
you made a bad decision.

00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:17.600
You bought a company that's
partially engaging in fraud.

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.922
So now Hewlett Packard
goes to the head

00:23:19.922 --> 00:23:22.380
of the company, the founder of
the company, starts laughing

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:23.230
at him.

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:24.310
He says, wait a minute.

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:27.310
You sent your accountants
in, the forensic accountants

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:30.660
came in, we have our
own big accountants.

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:33.920
I claim we're using
generally-accepted accounting.

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:36.770
One year later Hewlett
Packard writes off

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:39.165
every dime of that $9 billion.

00:23:39.165 --> 00:23:40.790
And when they write
off the $9 billion,

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:43.660
they wrote off as much of
everything else as they can.

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:47.090
This is very bullish,
because now you're

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:49.100
going to have less
expenses going forward.

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:50.724
Your earnings are
going to look better.

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:56.210
Here is Amazon's review.

00:23:56.210 --> 00:24:00.530
Amazon still reviews this
book, and I like this footnote

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:04.940
here about, "The most valuable
lesson I learned from the book

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:08.370
is to analyze the differences
in income reporting to the IRS

00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:10.340
versus to the shareholders.

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:14.170
Companies keep two types of
books-- one for the IRS, one

00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:16.260
for the shareholders."

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:18.550
There also can be a
third set of books,

00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:19.880
what I call the rigged books.

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:22.100
When a corporation
engages in fraud,

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:26.460
you've got shareholder books,
and you have the IRS books,

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:31.320
but then you have a third set of
books that they keep internally

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:34.867
where they see the difference
between the regular earnings

00:24:34.867 --> 00:24:36.200
and what the earnings should be.

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.750
Of course that's not public.

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:40.010
That's not shown to the SEC.

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:45.170
Now you have a picture of
Houdini, the famous magician,

00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:49.040
and here's what you
can do with earnings.

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:51.050
Remember Cisco Systems,
the great company--

00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:55.980
it's still a great company--
went public in the 1990s?

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:58.310
It split nine times in a row.

00:24:58.310 --> 00:25:01.955
It might be a record
for a technology company

00:25:01.955 --> 00:25:05.050
to split nine times
a row in 10 years.

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:10.080
What are the odds
that I, the company,

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:14.560
will report for nine years,
36 consecutive quarters,

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:18.680
I'm going to report one penny
above Wall Street consensus?

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.290
The odds are a million to one.

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:24.200
But they did this
for nine years.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:28.310
Every quarter was
$0.01 above consensus.

00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:32.070
During the dot com boom the
company got up to about 80.

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:34.450
It was selling about
100 times earnings.

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:38.670
I'm going to talk about the
price-earning ratio later.

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:40.750
The price-earning
ratio collapsed,

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:42.960
like most of the others
during the dot com boom.

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.418
By the way, most
of those companies

00:25:44.418 --> 00:25:46.830
didn't even have
earnings anyway.

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:50.600
And Cisco no longer needed to
show $0.01 above consensus.

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:53.350
It was now down to
12 times earnings,

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:56.780
and after going
down to 10 or 12,

00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:59.350
for years remained
down at 10 or 12.

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:02.760
They still had decent earnings,
but the price-earning ratio

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:04.400
boom was over.

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:05.800
Materiality.

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:11.010
I would include my book on
when a company will tell you

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:12.780
we have an item
that's immaterial.

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:14.420
When they say something
is immaterial,

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:16.229
the odds are it's material.

00:26:16.229 --> 00:26:18.770
But they don't want to clutter
up the balance sheet or income

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:21.190
statement with materiality.

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:25.320
The doctrine of materiality
is about 5% of the base.

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:29.030
If something is 5%
of the base or lower,

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:31.820
you don't necessarily have
to disclose an item that's

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:34.300
poor quality of earnings.

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:42.860
However, let's say that item is
100% of the gain year to year.

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:44.060
That's incremental.

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:46.120
But the accountants
and management

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:48.480
do not look at it incrementally.

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:51.730
So there's where the
magic Houdini comes in.

00:26:55.970 --> 00:27:01.000
Now I'm going to go to the best
pathway for individual success.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.570
I know Howard Marks was
here a couple of months ago.

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:07.770
They all-- everybody has
their own formula for,

00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:11.070
quote, "beating the market."

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:12.920
I can tell you one thing.

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:15.720
Anybody who thinks
the market's efficient

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:17.260
should see a psychologist.

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:18.580
They really should.

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:22.830
The market cannot be efficient,
because what is the formula

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:23.920
for the market?

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:27.220
Corporate earnings times
the price-earning ratio.

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:29.710
What will a dollar of
earnings bring you?

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:31.420
You sell for eight
times earnings.

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:33.280
Sell for 80 times earnings.

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:38.340
The price-earning ratios are
very volatile, up and down.

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:41.190
Also it's influenced
by inflation.

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:43.770
If it's lower, you'll get a
higher price-earning ratio.

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:46.920
If it's higher, you get a
lower price-earning ratio,

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:50.840
What is some more about
this long-term investing?

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.940
Ideally you should
buy as many stocks

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:54.610
as you can as young as you can.

00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:55.880
Buy as many stocks as you can.

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:58.480
Even if you only buy a couple
hundred stocks, by the time

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:00.340
you retire you
should try to have

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:03.070
50 or 100 individual stocks.

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:05.250
Almost never sell.

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:08.740
Concentrate on branded
names if you can.

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:11.770
Warren Buffett, if you
get to $120 billion

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:15.220
stock portfolio in Berkshire
Hathaway, $120 billion,

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:19.880
this is individual stocks--
American Express, Washington

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:25.630
Post, Bank of America,
Goldman Sachs, so it goes.

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:28.400
General Electric.

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.750
He buys branded names.

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:34.430
He's got $120 billion portfolio.

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:36.872
He's got 90 operating companies.

00:28:36.872 --> 00:28:38.330
Many of the operating
companies are

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:40.350
all branded names--
Geico Insurance,

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:47.300
See's Candy, Kraft,
Heinz, Horton Foods,

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:52.080
Burger King,
Berkshire real estate.

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:53.630
It goes on and on.

00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:55.820
Branded names.

00:28:55.820 --> 00:29:00.320
And the best way to find
branded names at the inception

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:04.590
is reading a prospectus.

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:08.850
If the market goes down or
you have a very poor market,

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:11.760
that's the best time
to buy new offerings.

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:20.540
Costco, Microsoft, Nike, Home
Depot, Starbucks, they all

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:22.600
started as new offerings.

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:25.442
Starbucks-- and by the way,
you don't know how much

00:29:25.442 --> 00:29:26.400
they're going to go up.

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:29.590
Starbucks, I believe,
is up 13,000 to one

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:32.350
since it went public in 2000.

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:34.320
No, in 1993 it went public.

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.670
I think it's up 13,000 to one.

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:41.260
Microsoft at the height
was up 800 to one.

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:43.020
Many of these stocks
are up 1,000 to one.

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:44.080
It's incredible.

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:47.270
You want to read a
good book on branding,

00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:50.149
it's called "Branding Relevance"
by Professor David Aaker.

00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:52.190
He's a professor at the
University of California.

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:54.430
He's also in the Hall
of Fame in marketing.

00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:57.580
In his book he talks
about branded companies

00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:58.550
and branded products.

00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:01.180
He doesn't really
discuss the stock market.

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:04.500
But what I told him-- I
talked to him briefly.

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:08.050
I said, you should take this
book, and all these companies

00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:12.610
you name, you should research
when they first went public

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:15.430
and what the price is
now, and this would be

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:18.300
a best-selling investment book.

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:20.500
Also it's a great
book to read if you're

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:24.170
going-- if you work
for a branded company,

00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:26.010
obviously you have an edge.

00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:29.040
A branded company has a
better chance of staying ahead

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.520
of the competition.

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:33.840
He tells those who work
for branded companies

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:36.190
how best to stay ahead
of the competition.

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:39.290
Some people go into
business for themselves.

00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:41.180
Try-- easier said than done.

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:44.260
Try to acquire for
yourself a branded name.

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:46.329
You understand about
the price-earning ratio

00:30:46.329 --> 00:30:47.870
and how it can go
up and down, so let

00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:50.760
me just tell you a little
bit about the stock market.

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:55.015
Now what is--
investors, you've got

00:30:55.015 --> 00:30:56.940
to be careful with the
price-earning ratio,

00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:59.310
because investors
like Howard Marks,

00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:02.680
they're not buying this
last 12 months' earnings

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:04.650
and they're not buying
this year's earnings.

00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:07.200
They're buying
tomorrow's earnings.

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:09.770
Right or wrong, they're all
buying tomorrow's earnings.

00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:13.240
The market is a
discounting process.

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:16.860
How does it do so well
predicting only with hindsight?

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:21.840
The depression, when the stock
market went from 380 to 40,

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.740
380 to 40.

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:27.260
The low in the
depression was 1932.

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:29.890
Industrial production
reached the low.

00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:32.520
The market never went
any lower after '32.

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:34.420
In fact, the market
had the biggest rally

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:39.400
in its history, percentage-wise,
went from 40 to 200

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:43.860
before the next recession came.

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:48.970
1942, June '42, the
war had just begun.

00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:50.180
The Battle of Midway.

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:52.510
The United States won
a tremendous victory

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:53.710
in the Battle of Midway.

00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:57.700
They sunk four of the Japanese
top eight aircraft carriers.

00:31:57.700 --> 00:31:59.839
Naval-wise, the Japanese
never recovered.

00:31:59.839 --> 00:32:01.380
The war went on for
three more years,

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:05.900
yet the American market
never went any lower.

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:09.860
World War II, the
evacuation from Dunkirk.

00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:12.250
They evacuated 300,000
troops that were

00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:14.700
trapped in Dunkirk, France.

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:17.180
That helped save England.

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:18.690
The war had just started.

00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:20.910
The market never went any lower.

00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:23.600
In fact, these
markets kept going up

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:27.850
while the war was being fought.

00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:30.619
What about the
history in America?

00:32:30.619 --> 00:32:32.910
And you can see why it's so
hard to predict the market.

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:36.190
When Eisenhower was
president in the '50s,

00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:38.980
the market was 10
times earnings.

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:41.550
When he left, it was
20 times earnings.

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:43.522
And corporate-- also
corporate earnings.

00:32:43.522 --> 00:32:45.480
The market is a function
of corporate earnings.

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:47.146
What are corporate
earnings going to be?

00:32:47.146 --> 00:32:49.450
Corporate earnings doubled
during his eight years,

00:32:49.450 --> 00:32:52.150
so now you had a
triple in the market.

00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:56.890
When Clinton was president,
you had a new post-war high

00:32:56.890 --> 00:32:57.390
in the Dow.

00:32:57.390 --> 00:32:59.700
I'm using the Dow because
it's the best, I think,

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:01.280
best indicator.

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:04.820
You went from 15 times earnings
to about 23 times earnings

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:07.670
under Clinton for a time.

00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:11.580
So not only had the corporate
earnings had been going way up,

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:13.830
but look what the
price-earning ratio did.

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:17.340
By going from 15 to
22 times earnings,

00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:21.040
you got a 50% increase
in price right there.

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.320
What about Jimmy Carter?

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:23.380
The opposite happened.

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:26.590
You had an almost
runaway inflation.

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:30.580
The Dow Jones went down
to six times earnings.

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:34.690
The stocks busted because
the price-earning ratios

00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:36.120
went way down.

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:39.660
The book value was only
one times earnings.

00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:40.790
[? Bowker ?] came along.

00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:45.240
He saved the economy from what
would have been hyperinflation,

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:47.740
and the market
recovered enormously.

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:51.227
Now when Howard Marks was here,
he talked about the nifty 50.

00:33:51.227 --> 00:33:53.060
What happens with the
market, and the reason

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:56.530
it's so hard to predict,
is you get these bubbles,

00:33:56.530 --> 00:33:58.180
or you get these fads.

00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:02.230
So in the '70s, almost
every serious investor

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:03.470
bought the nifty 50.

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:05.890
The nifty 50 were
blue chip stocks--

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:08.530
Merck, Procter and Gamble.

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:13.770
The problem was they were
selling at 50 times earnings.

00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:15.830
That bubble burst.

00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:17.889
The earnings did not go down.

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:19.540
The stocks remained
viable, but look

00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:20.790
what happened to these people.

00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:22.456
They bought at 40 and
50 times earnings,

00:34:22.456 --> 00:34:25.650
it went down 15 times
earnings and stayed down there

00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:26.530
for many years.

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:29.290
Some of them to this
day, good companies,

00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:31.489
have not gone above
15 times earnings.

00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:38.550
Now how can I prove out
very simply my thesis,

00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:40.650
the more stocks you buy?

00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:44.110
My wife, sitting here,
belongs to an investment club.

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:50.730
They own 35 stocks, and
over a period of years,

00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:54.110
they have outperformed
the market.

00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:55.190
They've tripled.

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:58.830
The value of the investment
portfolio has tripled.

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:02.240
I run into people and they say,
could you look at my portfolio?

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:04.210
And I say, I don't
want to-- I don't

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:07.340
need to look at your portfolio,
and don't tell me how

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:08.780
many dollars in the portfolio.

00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:10.696
All I want to know is
how many stocks you own.

00:35:10.696 --> 00:35:12.060
Just give me the names.

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:15.230
I've never failed to run
into an individual that

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:16.820
has a large amount
of stocks that

00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:18.640
hasn't outperformed the market.

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:20.990
My next door neighbor,
he's got 40 stocks.

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:22.470
He's 88 now.

00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:24.040
He's never sold
any of his stocks.

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:26.320
I recognize all the names.

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:28.940
I have another neighbor,
he's an energy consultant.

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:30.750
He has 100 stocks.

00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:32.960
Well, he's in pretty good shape.

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:35.010
And he's never sold a stock.

00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:38.180
And then we have a woman
acquaintance of ours.

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:41.540
A couple years ago, I asked
her how many stocks she owns.

00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:42.150
300!

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:43.990
Owns 300 stocks.

00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:45.740
And then a couple
years later, I saw her.

00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:46.948
I said, do you still own 300?

00:35:46.948 --> 00:35:48.500
She said no, I own 200.

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:50.420
I got in the hands of
an investment adviser--

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:52.910
which is the worst thing she
could ever do, and by the way,

00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:53.980
you cannot do this.

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:56.910
If you have an investment
adviser or stockbroker,

00:35:56.910 --> 00:36:00.780
they're going to turn you
over, the number of stocks.

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:02.350
You're going to have a turnover.

00:36:02.350 --> 00:36:06.450
And when you look at mutual
funds, the higher the turnover,

00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:09.730
they'll have less success
than some other mutual fund

00:36:09.730 --> 00:36:13.280
only turning over 20%.

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:16.490
And I said, are
you sorry now you

00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:17.900
sold any of these 100 stocks?

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:19.520
And she said yes.

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:22.720
And the other thing I asked
these individuals, when they do

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.976
sell stocks-- and
by the way, look.

00:36:24.976 --> 00:36:26.850
I'm not saying you
shouldn't sell any stocks.

00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:30.300
If the handwriting is on the
wall, by the time you know it,

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:32.870
the stock will
already be down 50%.

00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:33.974
I guarantee you that.

00:36:33.974 --> 00:36:35.890
But in some ways it's
better to sell the stock

00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:40.050
50% down before it goes to
oblivion, like Polaroid.

00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:45.650
And Avon is way down, and
Eastman Kodak long ago

00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:51.820
is no longer a blue chip.

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:54.600
If I was younger, I'd
have a booking agent

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:57.854
and I'd go on tour to lecture
about Warren Buffett, the mind

00:36:57.854 --> 00:36:58.520
and the company.

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:02.270
I think I know his mind,
company, as well as anybody.

00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:06.610
He has the most
multi-dimensional mind

00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:09.710
of any chief executive officer
in the history of America.

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:13.440
He's the greatest acquirer of
corporate corporations ever.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:16.370
If you invested with him
in '65 when he started,

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:20.480
$10,000 became $15 million.

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:23.290
He's also a world-class
investor in individual stocks.

00:37:23.290 --> 00:37:26.480
Like I said, they've got a
portfolio of $120 billion.

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:31.740
He's an organizational
genius, 340,000 employees.

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:36.140
He's got 26 preside
over the company.

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:37.800
26 at headquarters.

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:42.460
General Electric, a much smaller
conglomerate, has thousands.

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:45.640
The market cap is $360 billion.

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.460
He's got the company
in a lock box

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:51.470
because he owns an
incredible 25% voting control

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:52.770
as an individual himself.

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:55.990
The other inside, he's
got 40% voting control.

00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:58.720
He owns 20% economic
interest in this company.

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:02.040
That's $70 billion.

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:05.160
He's only paid one cash
dividend in all these years.

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:07.776
He only had one spin-off.

00:38:07.776 --> 00:38:09.150
Every time at the
annual meeting,

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:12.810
they ask him, how about
cash dividends or spin-offs?

00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:16.170
The two words are always
the same-- absolutely not.

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:19.030
But when you read the
shareholder's letter,

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:21.840
and fantasy would
be to have him here,

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:27.610
debate him for half an hour on
why he should deconglomerate

00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:31.410
instead of continuing to-- what
he calls a sprawling company.

00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:32.385
Those are his words.

00:38:32.385 --> 00:38:35.420
And he says he and his
sidekick, Charlie Munger,

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:37.520
are going to continue
to buy companies.

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:39.710
Buffett's 85, Munger's 92.

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:42.590
That's their hobby
now, buying companies.

00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:46.320
But if he spun off all
these 90 companies,

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:48.580
the stock would
double overnight,

00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:52.590
and then what would
happen is these spin-offs

00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:54.040
would have spin-offs
of spin-offs.

00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:56.750
So you have Kraft, Heinz.

00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:58.480
There are so many
companies he has where

00:38:58.480 --> 00:38:59.729
you could have many spin-offs.

00:38:59.729 --> 00:39:02.900
You'd have over 200
publicly traded companies

00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:06.907
on a tax-free spin-off basis
all paying cash dividend.

00:39:06.907 --> 00:39:08.490
What does he say in
the annual report?

00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:10.350
He contradicts himself.

00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:13.290
He says, I leave these
managements alone

00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:14.740
to the point of abdication.

00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:16.260
That's his word, abdication.

00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:18.020
But then in the next
sentence he says,

00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:20.280
I don't trust some of
the excess cash flow.

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:22.850
So the tens of billions of
dollars of excess cash flow

00:39:22.850 --> 00:39:26.890
go up to headquarters
so he can continue

00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:28.190
to make these acquisitions.

00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:31.340
But the fact remains every
one of these companies

00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:33.920
was successful before
he bought them.

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:35.390
He's never bought a turnaround.

00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:38.420
In the annual report he says,
if you have any tips for me

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:41.590
to buy a company, I
do not want a company

00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:43.260
with any problems or
anything like that.

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:46.210
We don't have the
staff to handle it.

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:48.990
And also he said the
managements are so good,

00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:50.860
and their successors,
that when I'm

00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:54.350
gone, even a fool would
be hard-pressed to run it

00:39:54.350 --> 00:39:55.690
into the ground.

00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:57.760
And finally, another
case he makes

00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:01.640
for dissolving this corporation
in favor of the shareholders

00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:05.790
is Henry Singleton, he says
is the greatest presider

00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:07.940
over conglomerates I ever met.

00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:09.900
He was famous for Teledyne.

00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:14.000
Henry Singleton shrunk
80% of his shares.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.980
By the time he was finished
managing the corporation,

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:19.880
80% of the shares were shrunk.

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:22.760
He was one of the pioneers
in rebuying shares,

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:26.120
and also he said there's
a time to deconglomerate.

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:29.950
So when he reached retirement
age-- in his case, in his 70s--

00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:34.530
he spun off the important
divisions to shareholders.

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:39.420
So Warren Buffett does not
follow what he preaches.

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:40.600
So what do we have here?

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:45.260
We have an index company
that would-- it's an index.

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:49.640
It's the only index fund, like
it has all the [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:52.370
of an index fund, but
has equity kickers.

00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:54.940
And here's my
prediction, which may

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:57.450
be the only one of its kind.

00:40:57.450 --> 00:41:00.970
Why does Warren Buffett-- why
is he so confident there will

00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:02.940
be no change after he's gone?

00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:05.360
Because he's got Bill Gates.

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:09.060
The lock box now goes to
Bill Gates Foundation.

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:12.280
The foundation already
has $45 billion.

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:14.610
Right now, with
this $70 billion,

00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:20.030
two thirds of what Buffett has,
his net worth is Berkshire,

00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:22.390
is going to go to the
Bill Gates Foundation.

00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:25.260
Why would you leave
two thirds to already

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:27.720
which is the largest
foundation, private foundation,

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:28.440
in the world?

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:31.380
The reason is you want
Bill Gates Foundation

00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:33.590
to have the voting control.

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:35.990
Bill Gates, who is
his bridge playing

00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:39.470
partner, personal friend,
sits on the board,

00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:41.650
they have agreed
we will continue

00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:44.670
to do what we're doing
under different managers.

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:45.300
That's all.

00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:48.130
We're not going to get
engaged in spin-offs

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:52.640
or being paid cash dividends.

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:55.250
I really thank you
for your attendance.

00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:57.700
Are we about on target now?

00:41:57.700 --> 00:41:58.420
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:00.240
THORNTON L. O'GLOVE:
OK, so any questions

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:04.582
you have on any subject
and so on, just feel free.

00:42:04.582 --> 00:42:06.540
AUDIENCE: Yeah, thank
you so much for the talk.

00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:09.440
So we've had a couple guests in
the past couple of weeks talk

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:13.930
about sort of the value
of long-term investing.

00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:17.920
Do you think it's
viable at all to think

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:20.630
about short-term investing
in the long term?

00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:25.440
So not exactly day trading,
but things of that nature,

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:28.170
where your period of
holding is on average, like,

00:42:28.170 --> 00:42:29.990
a week or a month.

00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:32.190
Do you think that's
a viable strategy

00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:35.092
at all for years to come?

00:42:35.092 --> 00:42:36.550
THORNTON L. O'GLOVE:
I myself, I've

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:40.990
never been able to succeed very
well with short-term investing.

00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:47.170
There are some that-- a
few individuals that do

00:42:47.170 --> 00:42:48.775
very well short-term investing.

00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:57.270
Bogle, the high priest
of the index funds,

00:42:57.270 --> 00:43:01.160
he swears that over
time you do better

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:03.670
as a long-term
investor in index fund.

00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:07.170
Most mutual firms
investment advisers

00:43:07.170 --> 00:43:09.360
do not beat the market.

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:12.030
And one reason they don't
beat the market is the fees

00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:13.760
also weigh against you.

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:19.650
And you'd be surprised with 2%,
if you own a fund for 20 years,

00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:25.220
and how much 2% can wind up
decreasing your performance

00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:26.200
by-- about one third.

00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:28.570
And there's another
hidden factor out there.

00:43:28.570 --> 00:43:30.540
There's the spread
in buying stocks.

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:32.660
There is a spread
in buying stocks.

00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:35.320
Sometimes there might
be a dime spread.

00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:38.760
So there's a cost, the more
you turn over that fund,

00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:40.510
the higher your costs
are going to be.

00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:43.620
And I forgot to say something
about long-term investing

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:45.110
and owning a lot of stocks.

00:43:45.110 --> 00:43:48.890
Psychologically, you're going
to be better off the more

00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:52.380
stocks you own, because when
you have these market crashes--

00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:56.720
a market crash is 40% or
50%, and the market crashes

00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:09.190
I can remember is in the '70s,
'87, early '90s, early 2000,

00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:13.390
and then we had
another one 2008.

00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:16.390
Although your stocks will
go down-- I own 100 stocks,

00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:17.830
you own 10.

00:44:17.830 --> 00:44:19.820
Well, your 10 stocks are
going to go way down.

00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:21.190
So are mine.

00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:22.570
But psychologically,
you're going

00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:24.680
to feel much better off
with those 100 stocks.

00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:26.640
You'll be less inclined to sell.

00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:32.860
You'd be surprised how these
crashes really weigh on people,

00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:36.390
and the trigger-- all they
need to trigger an investment

00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:39.350
adviser or their
wife or whatever

00:44:39.350 --> 00:44:44.085
to say you own too many stocks.

00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:52.580
Sell them, you
know, what you can.

00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:56.920
SPEAKER: How a technology
company can capitalize software

00:44:56.920 --> 00:45:01.250
expense and the earnings
can look really good

00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:03.980
for a one-time change?

00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:07.770
THORNTON L. O'GLOVE: Yeah,
here again a great example.

00:45:07.770 --> 00:45:13.360
First of all, a small company
is more likely to capitalize

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:15.917
software for IRS purposes.

00:45:15.917 --> 00:45:17.500
You don't have to
capitalize software.

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:20.860
Software is an
immediate expense.

00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:24.650
Most large companies
don't capitalize software,

00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:32.320
but if you really need a
jolt in earnings, you defer,

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:35.090
you'll amortize the software.

00:45:35.090 --> 00:45:40.750
And Enron is a great example,
selling at 100 times earnings.

00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:43.424
If they didn't capitalize
that dime of software,

00:45:43.424 --> 00:45:45.840
the entire gain-- you've got
to remember, 100% of the gain

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:47.990
came from capitalizing
software, that one item.

00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:50.550
$0.90 up to $1.

00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:56.280
Well, the earnings,
the stock, if they

00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:59.290
earned $0.95 instead
of $1, the stock

00:45:59.290 --> 00:46:01.700
would have gone down 50 points.

00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:04.550
SPEAKER: So the way he
defines owner earnings,

00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:10.430
he says it's net income plus
depreciation plus amortization

00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:11.819
minus capital expenditures.

00:46:11.819 --> 00:46:13.610
THORNTON L. O'GLOVE:
You know what that is?

00:46:13.610 --> 00:46:14.880
Cash flow.

00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:18.880
What that is, that's the
best definition of cash flow.

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:23.140
Warren Buffett makes
fun out of non-GAAP

00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:28.280
and all these other
numbers they come up with.

00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:30.434
Here again, lying
with statistic.

00:46:30.434 --> 00:46:32.100
You'll read in "The
Wall Street Journal"

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:35.440
day after day now bigger
and bigger gap between GAAP

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:38.580
and adjusted earnings,
which may not include

00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:41.300
the compensation on workers.

00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:46.220
They may leave out
what is recurring.

00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:49.700
I mean, what is recurring,
they'll emphasize.

00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:52.880
What's non-recurring,
they'll de-emphasize.

00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:55.230
That won't be part
of adjusted earnings.

00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:58.520
And Warren Buffett
is real full of this.

00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:02.460
He says you should-
GAAP is tough enough,

00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:05.080
and you shouldn't
have these other types

00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:08.660
of supplementary earnings.

00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:13.230
I would buy some ETFs, although
they haven't been around

00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:14.200
long enough.

00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:16.970
I don't know how they're
going to do in the next crash.

00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:19.660
Some people are
leery of these ETFs.

00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:23.790
They become so large you may
not be able get out of them.

00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:27.310
I'd be so much leerier of
them, maybe have a few ETFs.

00:47:27.310 --> 00:47:30.980
I'd be very careful,
especially ones with leverage.

00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:34.080
I stay away with
leverage, and I would just

00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:37.722
try to buy individual
stocks maybe.

00:47:41.790 --> 00:47:42.840
Oh, I forgot.

00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:45.380
Or a masseuse my wife
has a masseuse that

00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:47.490
has come in for 20 years now.

00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:49.150
He's got 100 stocks.

00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:51.690
He reads "Value
Line." "Value Line"

00:47:51.690 --> 00:47:53.410
is the best
publication to give you

00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:57.180
a quick overview
of all the stats

00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:59.850
and what they think
about a stock.

00:47:59.850 --> 00:48:01.470
It's just one page.

00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:04.600
It's full of more information
than any other source

00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:06.760
It'll give you
predictions on earnings,

00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:08.600
what the cash flow has been.

00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:10.730
It's remarkable what
"Value Line" does.

00:48:10.730 --> 00:48:13.120
They've been in
business for 50 years.

00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:14.180
He looks at "Value Line."

00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:16.580
He spends a lot of time
looking at "Value Line,"

00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:20.570
or he went in Ross Stores.

00:48:20.570 --> 00:48:21.740
One mistake I made.

00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:24.720
I went in Ross Stores
with my wife years ago,

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:28.530
and they had-- it's a great
discounter store selling

00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:30.840
all kinds of merchandise.

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:32.380
They have a branded name.

00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:34.200
They have few competitors.

00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:36.770
Ross Stores is practically
up 1,000 to one.

00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:38.632
You wouldn't believe
it over the years.

00:48:38.632 --> 00:48:40.090
And another thing
that happens when

00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:43.780
you get hold of one of these
home runs, most of them

00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:45.680
don't pay dividends
at the start.

00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:47.510
Starbucks didn't pay a dividend.

00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:49.720
Microsoft never paid a dividend.

00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:52.892
But what happened is the
longer you own them--

00:48:52.892 --> 00:48:54.350
and the price-earning
ratio will go

00:48:54.350 --> 00:48:58.240
higher earlier, but as the
price-earning ratio levels off,

00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:01.250
which it has to do, that's when
they start paying dividends,

00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:03.960
and the dividends
themselves can be a bonanza.

00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:07.530
Now, the stock market,
when you look at how much

00:49:07.530 --> 00:49:10.890
the stock market's
gone up, the Dow Jones,

00:49:10.890 --> 00:49:14.470
one third is a
function of dividends.

00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:17.420
One third, function
of dividends.

00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:20.720
No, I don't think the
stock market is overvalued.

00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:26.400
Going ahead back to the '50s,
it went from 10 times earnings

00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:28.947
to 22 times earnings when
Eisenhower left office,

00:49:28.947 --> 00:49:30.280
and you know what's interesting?

00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:35.270
This shows you why anybody
pretends to predict the market

00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:37.520
except on a long-term basis.

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:41.360
Incredibly, Eisenhower
left office in '62.

00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:44.090
Do you know the price-earning
ratio of the Dow

00:49:44.090 --> 00:49:48.530
steadily went down from
22 times earnings-- not

00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:52.620
all at once-- to a
low of six times years

00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:55.120
later when Carter
became president?

00:49:55.120 --> 00:50:00.840
And then it went back up
and reached a new high

00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:02.390
during the past 50 years.

00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:07.050
It hit about 23 times
earnings under Clinton.

00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:10.210
And earnings are
defined by "Value Line"

00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:11.450
as operating earnings.

00:50:11.450 --> 00:50:18.500
Operating earnings, you leave
out non-recurring earnings.

00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:21.180
They usually leave
out or write off,

00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:25.639
so they have their own what I
call the best way of analyzing

00:50:25.639 --> 00:50:26.430
operating earnings.

00:50:26.430 --> 00:50:29.220
So I'll be talking about
operating earnings now.

00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:32.777
SPEAKER: How do you know what's
a good brand ahead of time?

00:50:32.777 --> 00:50:33.860
THORNTON L. O'GLOVE: Yeah.

00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:38.820
The question is there are so
many offerings that go public.

00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:42.450
Obviously if you read David
Aaker's book, at least

00:50:42.450 --> 00:50:44.560
all these companies
are successful.

00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:47.590
He doesn't name the thousands
that have gone public

00:50:47.590 --> 00:50:48.990
over the years.

00:50:48.990 --> 00:50:51.280
Especially during
the dot com boom,

00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:56.120
there was really-- you want
to talk about psychology,

00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:58.400
most of these companies
went public and some of them

00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:01.470
went up from $10 to
hundreds and hundreds.

00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:03.900
They had no earnings
even to support them.

00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:07.450
And today there's a lot of
these price-earning ratio--

00:51:07.450 --> 00:51:10.270
these new offerings around
have very little in earnings

00:51:10.270 --> 00:51:11.245
to support them.

00:51:11.245 --> 00:51:14.100
So that's a great question.

00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:16.910
One thing I've also looked
at is the competition.

00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:18.820
The first thing I look
at is competition.

00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:21.530
How much competition
do they have?

00:51:21.530 --> 00:51:24.090
The little the
competition they have,

00:51:24.090 --> 00:51:27.760
the more the branded name,
or what they call the moat,

00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:32.300
M-O-A-T, the moat around them,
and the more difficult it is

00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:36.620
to do what they do, then the
better off you're going to be.

00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:39.710
Some of the great examples
of all time, McDonald's.

00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:41.380
Never been a franchise.

00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:44.330
McDonald's only started
with a few franchises.

00:51:44.330 --> 00:51:46.630
And the same thing
on Burger King,

00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:51.340
and on Starbucks, Microsoft.

00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:54.610
But if you read, Microsoft,
when it first went public,

00:51:54.610 --> 00:51:58.580
it was in the forefront
of the internet.

00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:00.632
And one of the biggest
mistakes IBM made was they

00:52:00.632 --> 00:52:01.590
could have bought them.

00:52:01.590 --> 00:52:02.500
They didn't buy them.

00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:04.070
And when you read
a prospectus, he

00:52:04.070 --> 00:52:07.890
was a young guy-- sometimes
you can see genius.

00:52:07.890 --> 00:52:10.230
When you read about-- one
thing about prospectus,

00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:11.690
if you want to
read the 80 pages,

00:52:11.690 --> 00:52:14.370
it will give you
so much information

00:52:14.370 --> 00:52:19.310
that is not stilted, because
they come under SEC regulation

00:52:19.310 --> 00:52:23.380
and they can't hide the
warts and things like that.

00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:26.469
So if they have
heavy competition,

00:52:26.469 --> 00:52:28.010
or they have a
particular competitor,

00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:30.040
that has to be revealed
in the prospectus.

00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:32.081
Also you have to look at
the price-earning ratio.

00:52:32.081 --> 00:52:34.580
Remember now, in a
bull market, they're

00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:38.910
going to come out with these new
offerings that inflated values.

00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:41.340
The best time to buy a new
offering is when the market is

00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:48.053
either sideways or you
have recovered from a-- you

00:52:48.053 --> 00:52:50.260
don't have to have
a crash, but a 20--

00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:52.070
for example, a 20% decline.

00:52:52.070 --> 00:52:56.590
A bear market is loosely
declined as 20% down.

00:52:56.590 --> 00:52:59.037
A crash, 40%.

00:52:59.037 --> 00:53:00.870
SPEAKER: We thank you
so much, and thank you

00:53:00.870 --> 00:53:01.750
all for coming here.

00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:02.350
Thanks.

00:53:02.350 --> 00:53:05.100
[APPLAUSE]
