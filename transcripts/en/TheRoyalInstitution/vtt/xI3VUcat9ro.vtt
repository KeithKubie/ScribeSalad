00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:14.110
Aoife, we are going to try and use your voice
to break this glass here, all right? So over

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:21.210
here, we have a microphone, OK? And to help
you with that note, we've got the same note

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:28.090
playing in these ear phones. So that should
be about the right note so that that note

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.110
corresponds with the natural frequency of
this glass. So it goes into resonance.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:39.520
So you want to get the molecules of the glass
vibrating like sound energy in the voice of

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.930
Ifa here to show you just how destructive
sound can be. Now, Ifa, this is really hard

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.610
to do. I'll tell you now, I had to go. But
I'm a rubbish singer. So I'm expecting greatness

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:59.920
from you. OK. So, ready, steady, go.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.579
Ah.

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:12.440
Oh, close. Cause, Aoife, good try. Good try.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.310
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:23.780
Aoife, there is someone who can do this. And
that is the amazing Lucy Haken who

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.970
is my producer, who tells me she can, which
is why we're here. So ladies and gentleman,

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.010
Lucy Haken.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.720
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.979
I would protect your ears, here, not because
Lucy is terrible at singing, but because it's

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:40.500
just very, very loud. OK, let's have a go.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.530
Hoo. Hoo.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.549
Oh!

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:40.560
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:40.560 --> 00:02:02.400
Aoife, she broke the glass. But you're a much
better singer. Thank you so much.
