Narrator:
IN THE WORLD OF DIAMOND MINING,
EVERYTHING STARTS WITH A BANG.

00:00:15.381 --> 00:00:16.682
AT THE DIAVIK MINE,

00:00:16.682 --> 00:00:20.419
THEY BLAST OUT THOUSANDS
OF TONS OF ROCK PER DAY,

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:21.654
SEARCHING FOR DIAMONDS

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:25.492
WHICH ORIGINALLY FORMED
93 MILES BELOW GROUND.

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:30.630 line:0%
THE DEEPEST HOLE
WE'VE EVER DUG

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.932 line:0%
ISN'T EVEN A TENTH AS DEEP.

00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:35.434 line:0%
SO HOW DID THEY GET
TO THE SURFACE?

00:00:35.434 --> 00:00:37.837
VOLCANIC ACTIVITY
CARRIED THEM UP

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:40.806
THROUGH THE PLANET'S CRUST.

00:00:40.806 --> 00:00:44.143
Narrator: THEY'RE EXCAVATING
2.5 BILLION YEAR OLD ROCK

00:00:44.143 --> 00:00:47.647
TO REACH THE VOLCANIC DEPOSITS
CALLED KIMBERLITE PIPES

00:00:47.647 --> 00:00:49.081
WHERE THE DIAMONDS LIE.

00:00:49.081 --> 00:00:51.817
Man: KIMBERLITE PIPE IS JUST
A ROUND PIPE OF LAVA FLOW

00:00:51.817 --> 00:00:55.922
THAT COMES UP MILLIONS
AND MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO THAT

00:00:55.922 --> 00:01:00.192
WE'RE ACTUALLY DRILLING
IN AN OLD VOLCANO.

00:01:00.192 --> 00:01:05.598
Narrator: VOLCANIC ORE IS LOADED
ONTO GIANT 240-TON TRUCKS

00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:07.366
THAT CREEP UP THE SPIRALING RIM

00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:10.836
OF THE CRATER
TO THE PROCESSING PLANT.

00:01:10.836 --> 00:01:12.438
IT MAY LOOK
LIKE THEY'RE CARRYING

00:01:12.438 --> 00:01:15.541
JUST A HEAP OF BOULDERS,
BUT HIDDEN IN EACH LOAD,

00:01:15.541 --> 00:01:20.479
THERE COULD BE 700 CARATS
OF ROUGH DIAMONDS.

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.816 line:0%
THESE ROCKS ARE VALUABLE,
BUT ONCE THEY'RE PROCESSED,

00:01:23.816 --> 00:01:27.553 line:0%
THEY'LL BE WORTH
FIVE TIMES AS MUCH.

00:01:27.553 --> 00:01:29.155
Narrator:
WHEN THE ORE REACHES THE PLANT,

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:32.158
THE NEXT CHALLENGE IS TO BREAK
IT DOWN TO SMALL PIECES

00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:34.860
ABOUT ONE INCH WIDE.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.097
TO ACHIEVE THAT, THE BOULDERS
PASS THROUGH A SERIES

00:01:38.097 --> 00:01:41.433
OF MASSIVE CRUSHING MACHINES,
WHICH REDUCE THEIR SIZE

00:01:41.433 --> 00:01:46.138
WITHOUT DESTROYING
THE PRECIOUS GEMS INSIDE.

00:01:46.138 --> 00:01:48.908
AT THE END OF THE GAUNTLET
OF CRUSHERS, WHAT'S LEFT

00:01:48.908 --> 00:01:54.513
IS A MIX OF PRICELESS GEMS
AND WORTHLESS STONES.

00:01:54.513 --> 00:01:58.317
THE WHOLE LOT IS SENT
186 MILES SOUTH TO ONE OF

00:01:58.317 --> 00:02:02.755
THE MOST HEAVILY FORTIFIED
COMPLEXES IN NORTH AMERICA.

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:05.058
DIAMONDS ARE PERFECT TO STEAL.

00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:08.027
THEY'RE SMALL, LIGHT,
AND WORTH A FORTUNE.

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:09.195
IN ONE RECENT HEIST,

00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:12.665
A THIEF GOT AWAY WITH
$136 MILLION WORTH.

00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:17.536
THAT'S EQUIVALENT IN VALUE
TO 3 1/2 TONS OF GOLD.

00:02:17.536 --> 00:02:21.907
Narrator:
THE NEXT CHALLENGE IS TO REMOVE
THE FINAL TRACES OF ROCK.

00:02:21.907 --> 00:02:25.144
TO DO THAT, A ROBOT PLUNGES
THE BATCH OF ROUGH DIAMONDS

00:02:25.144 --> 00:02:27.180
INTO A HOT CHEMICAL BATH.

00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:33.920
WHEN THAT'S OVER,
THE ROCKS ARE GONE,

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.256
AND ALL THAT'S LEFT
IS ROUGH DIAMONDS.
