00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.210
Another big piece of the user
experience are notifications.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.183
Notifications allow you to
communicate with the user,

00:00:08.183 --> 00:00:12.917
and they can take many different forms,
text messages, emails,

00:00:12.917 --> 00:00:18.260
push notifications, icons,
vibrations, banners, and alerts.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.060
You'll need to think carefully about
how often you notify users and

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.150
what forms those notifications take,

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.630
since they contribute to
the overall user experience.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.780
A graph or matrix like this one can help
you think through the importance and

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.180
urgency of your notifications.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.940
As I walk through the upcoming examples,
you should think about

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.780
where notifications might
fall on this diagram.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.180
In general, you want to avoid sending
many messages that have low importance

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.760
and low urgency.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.970
If you're sending a lot of
these types of messages,

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.200
it can make your product feel spammy.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.480
Keep in mind that the frequency for a
given notification may change over time,

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.990
and this graph might look different for
different personas using the product.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.130
You should think about
different notifications for

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.069
different personas as you
work on your product.

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:07.800
Some might have preferences for
one notification over others.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.560
In general, there's some key
qualities of notifications

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.930
that you should keep in mind for
your users.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.300
The first one is control.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.940
And it's the most important thing
that you want to give users.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.910
Little Big Details is a website
that showcases a lot of

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.010
awesome user experience.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.370
When it comes to control,

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.940
Foursquare in Apple gives users lots
of control through menus like these.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.730
The second is feedback.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.510
Other types of notifications
involve informing the user

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.680
about tasks that they are performing.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.120
This is really just about good
design in user experience.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.220
The feedback provided is
dependent on the product.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.740
And by providing great feedback,
you can make users

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.610
feel like you're looking out for them
while making the product more usable.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.390
For example, Twitter will try and

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.580
provide feedback if you
send the same tweet twice.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.210
Slack, a messaging app also
provides great feedback to users.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.750
It provides a confirmation
when sending a message

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.480
to a channel that has people
in different time zones.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.660
And Amazon provides feedback about
whether someone may have bought you

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.280
an item on your Wish List.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.160
All of these notifications
are related to feedback loops for

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.170
users to successfully complete tasks.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.280
The third is customization.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.940
It's a more subtle aspect of
notifications for your users.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.790
You might do this based on time,
task, location or

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.630
some other attribute
that's tied to the user.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.420
Facebook for example, shows a different
part of the world to users,

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.840
depending on the user's location.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.870
Finally, you can develop notifications
that lead users to form a habit of using

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.440
your product depending on the frequency
and any rewards you might give them.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.391
You can tap into what Nir Eyal
describes as variable rewards.

00:02:44.391 --> 00:02:48.799
GitHub provides variable rewards to its
users by showing a different Octocat

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.150
each time the user has
no new notifications.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.030
Tumblr sends emails with playful
texts when a user follows someone or

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.310
when someone else follows that user.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.450
And, Coffee Meets Bagel,
which is a dating application,

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.060
uses digital currency to reward users
for tapping into the dating app.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.420
Each of these qualities contributes
to the user experience and

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.880
their perception of your product.
