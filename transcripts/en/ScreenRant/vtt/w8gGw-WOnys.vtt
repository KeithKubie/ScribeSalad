00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.219
Just when it seemed like animated movies were
done surprising audiences, Disney's Zootopia

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.200
arrived to blow the doors off of Disney's
opening weekend numbers, proving how hard

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:22.440
it is to judge an animated book by its cover.
But most audiences will never know about the

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.559
work that goes into these films months, or
even years ahead of time. To help solve that

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:30.450
problem, we're back with another rapid-fire
dose of movie trivia, giving a peek behind

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.770
the scenes of some of Hollywood's biggest
animated hits in the latest installment of

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.940
Know Your Movies: 20 Awesome Facts About Animated
Movies.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:39.940
Zootopia

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.370
The movie begins when Emmet Otterton is reported
missing, but most viewers are too young to

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.730
realize that the writers are quietly concluding
the story of the star of "Emmet Otter's Jug

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.079
Band Christmas," a children's book published
in 1977, and adapted into a TV special with

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.270
help from Jim Henson.
As a young police officer out to prove her

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.060
skills, Officer Judy Hopps does her namesake
proud. The inspiration is obviously Officer

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.869
Judy&nbsp;Hoffs, Holly Robinson's character on
21 Jump Street, the late-80s TV show following

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:08.710
an entire cast of fresh-faced young cops.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.780
Frozen star Kristen Bell only appears for
a single scene, but her cameo as a sloth working

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.289
Zootopia's DMV is probably one of her favorite
roles to date, since the actress' crippling

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:24.280
love of the slow-moving mammals is well-documented
- she even owns one.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.950
Big Hero 6
The robot hero of the movie, Baymax, manages

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.539
to emote even with an expressionless face.
But his look actually comes from the Japanese

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.359
bell known as suzu - the same bell that the
Pokemon Ching Ching is inspired by.

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:41.039
Most fans won't realize that Big Hero isn't
just set in a futuristic city, but an alternate

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.760
future dreamed up by the writers. In the movie's
version of history, the 1906 earthquake that

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.729
destroyed 80% of San Francisco was rebuilt
by Japanese immigrants, explaining the architecture,

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.689
and the new name: San Fransokyo.

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.501
Tangled
The first CG fairy tale from Disney was a

00:01:56.501 --> 00:02:00.979
massive hit, but it actually began as a sort-of
sequel to Enchanted, a movie about a cartoon

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.819
Disney princess thrown into the real world.
Rapunzel would have been turned into a squirrel

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:08.311
just like Enchanted's Pip, with a girl from
the real world being thrown into her place

00:02:08.311 --> 00:02:11.770
in the animated one. Thankfully, some changes
were made.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.282
The Little Mermaid
The movie, and the studio, owed most of its

00:02:15.282 --> 00:02:19.700
success to one of its most lovable leading
ladies: Ariel. But most fans don't know that

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.629
her quirks, ticks, or endearing personality
came from copying actual scenes performed

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:28.680
by Sherri Lynn Stoner, whose natural improvisations
wound up being etched in Disney stone.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.519
Frozen
The production team headed for Norway to do

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.700
all their research before creating Frozen's
kingdom of Arendelle - including some stranger

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.489
local stories. You might just ignore the two
subjects arguing over the right way to stack

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.540
firewood, but it's a nod to a real controversy
that struck Norway in 2013, when a TV live

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.189
feed of a fireplace received dozens of complaints
that the wood was placed incorrectly - completely

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:52.930
split between bark up, or down. Talk about
an inside joke.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.439
The Lion King
The name of the movie seems pretty straightforward,

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:59.770
but its original title was actually "King
of the Jungle." Marketing materials and merchandise

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.620
had even been made before the studio realized...
lions don't live in the jungle. Since the

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.000
movie was pitched to the screenwriter as "Bambi
in Africa Meets Hamlet," there as another

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.810
working title, too: "Bamlet," for short.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.650
Wreck-it Ralph
For all the video game companies that gave

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.650
rights to Disney for this retro adventure,
the makers of the Mortal Kombat series weren't

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.950
as willing. From the red eye, robot arm and
tribal tattoos, fans may think they spot the

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.710
classic character Kano in the Bad-Anon meeting,
but he's actually credited as "Cyborg" for

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.760
legal reasons. Even though he still executes
the fighter's signature finisher.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.840
There are almost too many video game easter
eggs to count in the movie, but one stands

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.939
apart. Pay close attention to the Fix-It Felix
arcade cabinet, and you'll notice the high

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:47.120
score of 120501 - or December 5th, 1901 - the
birthday of Walt Disney himself. Who knew?

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.430
How to Train Your Dragon
Audiences didn't know what to make of Toothless,

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.680
the movie's titular dragon, since he doesn't
fit the usual design of the flying fire-breathers.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.040
He was originally going to look more like
a wolf, and closer to a traditional dragon

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.319
- but when a team member's screensaver of
a black leopard popped up, the design was

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:03.719
changed immediately.

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:07.549
It's no surprise that Toothless looks more
than a little like the alien star of Disney's

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:11.999
Lilo and Stitch. But for all the movie's fans,
Pixar boss John Lasseter wasn't among them.

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:16.120
When he took the reins for Disney Animation,
he let the directors go. DreamWorks swooped

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.490
in, landing the duo, and one of their most
successful properties to date.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:23.560
Despicable Me
Against all odds, the reformed super villain

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.920
Gru wound up becoming a household name for
young fans of the movie. But the movie actually

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.390
reveals, thanks to his adoption paperwork,
that Gru is his last name - his first name

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.510
is "Felonius." Considering how famous the
character really is, and what a catchy name

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.130
it is in total, Felonius Monk should look
out.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.380
The language of the Minions might sound like
gibberish, but the production team really

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.841
did write out all the dialogue, translating
each and every word into Minion-ese. Since

00:04:46.841 --> 00:04:51.160
the crew spanned the United States, France,
Spain, and beyond, the blend of languages

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.270
that seem to be spoken by the yellow goons
makes perfect sense.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.440
Kung Fu Panda
It's fair to say that this martial arts movie

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.390
turned out far better than most expected,
and that's mainly due to the years of research

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.450
the team put into learning martial arts filmmaking,
and Chinese history in general. The result

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.470
was so respectful and accurate, the movie
actually urged heads of Chinese cultural and

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.000
government groups to try to find out why they
hadn't made something close to it themselves.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.230
The LEGO Movie
Nobody predicted that this toy-turned movie

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.820
would be as good as it was, but the people
actually making it didn't cut any corners.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.010
When it came time to record music for the
movie's Old West Land, composer Mark Mothersbaugh

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.200
didn't settle for just an homage to legendary
director Ennio Morricone, but tracked down&nbsp;Alessandro

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.840
Alessandroni, the man who delivered the famous
whistling notes to record some for the movie.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.790
There were a ton of jokes that only adults
could appreciate, but one actually had to

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.490
be cut. Lord Business runs a tight operation,
but one scene showed that a team of Scuba

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.300
Cops was spending their time getting romantic
with mermaids instead of doing their job.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.230
It was one of the only things test audiences
thought was a little&nbsp;too&nbsp;adult for kids,

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.460
and was cut (along with... not much else).

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.780
Happy Feet
Everyone knows the story of Mumble, the penguin

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.541
who couldn't sing, but could dance like a
regular Fred Astaire - literally. Plenty of

00:06:02.541 --> 00:06:06.060
Fred Astaire's footwork was drawn upon for
the motion capture dancing, but even Mumble's

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.910
design was tweaked to resemble the famous
dancing actor. There's the suggestion of a

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.040
bowtie on mumble's neck, and even three black
spots on his ankle to subconsciously pay homage

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.650
to spats worn in old Hollywood musicals.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.290
The Iron Giant
It became a criminally underrated sci-fi story,

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.160
but The Iron Giant was almost a musical from
The Who's lead guitarist, Pete Townshend.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.110
Townshend had been working for years on an
adaptation of the same novel, "The Iron Man,"

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.870
planning a concept album alongside it. His
producing partner thought animation might

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:36.240
be better, and successfully pitched the story
to Warner Bros., with Townsend staying on

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.940
to executive produce.&nbsp;

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.440
Those are the bits of trivia, easter eggs
and behind-the-scenes secrets we found for
