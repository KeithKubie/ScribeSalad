Hi, I'm Michael Littman.

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:06.150
You may remember me from such courses as
Machine Learning, Intro to Algorithms,

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.090
and well, this course.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.340
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Chris Pryby.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.190
I'm a course developer with Udacity,
and I worked with Charles and

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.440
Michael to build this course.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.030
&gt;&gt; Where is Charles anyway?

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.270
&gt;&gt; You know what,
let's just add him in post.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.080
&gt;&gt; The main goal of this course
is that you become prepared to

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.700
engage with the reinforcement
learning community.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.830
One aspect of being engaged with
the community is becoming familiar with

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.590
software built specifically for
solving reinforcement learning problems.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.430
To help you with this goal,
you will use a java framework called

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.990
the Brown UMBC Reinforcement Learning
and Planning library, or BURLAP.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.970
&gt;&gt; In this tutorial lesson I
will introduce you to BURLAP and

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.520
help you write your first
programs using the library.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.560
We'll talk about how to set up and
solve a basic MDP using BURLAP.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.830
&gt;&gt; As you work through the course,

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.580
we encourage you to think
about the planning and

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.310
learning algorithms presented, and
try to implement them using BURLAP.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.030
A great resource to consult
is the BURLAP documentation,

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.950
available at the URL listed
in the instructor notes.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.600
&gt;&gt; All right, Michael,
ready to get started?

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.250
&gt;&gt; I'm ready.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.310
&gt;&gt; Awesome, yeah!
