00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.480
 In this video I want to 

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.210
 he explains 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.150
 potassium-sodium pump. 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:06.860
 As the name suggests, it pumps 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.800
 sodium and potassium, but 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.450
 in different directions. 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.570
 This is a pump scheme, 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.835
 this is my drawing, my version of 

00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:16.170
 potassium-sodium pump. 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.620
 It is transmembrane 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.035
 protein complex. 

00:00:21.035 --> 00:00:22.790
 In an inactive state 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.550
 it is open to the inside of the cage 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.450
 and has affinity for sodium ions. 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:30.830
 Here you see 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.350
 three sodium ions, 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:33.400
 depicted in blue. 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.600
 They will connect to the pump. 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.530
 Once they do 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.820
 the pump will want to be 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.960
 phosphorylated by ATP. 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.820
 We see this here. 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:44.950
 This is the ATP, 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.630
 adenosine triphosphate. 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.260
 When the pump is phosphorylated, 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.781
 energy is released, 

00:00:50.781 --> 00:00:52.330
 which allows change in conformation (structure) 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.530
 of the protein that builds the pump. 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.020
 The new conformation of the protein 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.420
 will be open from above, 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.120
 to the outside and closed to the interior of the cell. 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.700
 She will not be there anymore 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.260
 affinity for sodium ions, 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.350
 but to potassium ions. 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.450
 This is very interesting. 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.730
 The release of energy, the change in conformation, 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.120
 that these proteins 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.500
 are molecular machines, 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.560
 remarkable molecular machines. 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.900
 Once this happens, 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.422
 once the conformation of the protein has changed, 

00:01:18.422 --> 00:01:19.360
 sodium ions will be 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.460
 separated outside the cage. 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.050
 Then we will have potassium ions, 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.190
 which will be connected to the outside of the pump. 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.806
 When this happened, 

00:01:26.806 --> 00:01:28.060
 there will be a conformational change. 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.690
 The pump will be 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.900
 dephosphorylated 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.050
 and will return to 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.660
 its initial conformation. 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.689
 This initial conformation. 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:37.390
 When the pump stops affinity to 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.060
 potassium ions, 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.435
 they will be released 

00:01:40.435 --> 00:01:41.000
 and we will return 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.076
 to the initial phase. 

00:01:43.076 --> 00:01:44.150
 This is remarkable! 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.450
 To carry out this transport is 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.020
 uses ATP, uses energy, hence it is active transport. 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.384
 It takes energy to get it done. 

00:01:49.384 --> 00:01:51.020
 I will write it. 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.750
 This is active, 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.690
 this is an active transport. 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.420
 We talk about it 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.520
 here. 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.820
 Pumping ions, 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.237
 using ATP. We can pump 

00:02:01.237 --> 00:02:03.700
 three sodium ions out, 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.330
 three sodium ions out, 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.620
 I'll write it down. 

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:09.692
 Three sodium ions out. 

00:02:09.692 --> 00:02:11.530
 In this process, we pump and 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.520
 two potassium ions inside. 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.760
 Pumping two potassium 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.420
 ion inside the cell. 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.360
 Now you can say, 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.020
 "Well, both sodium and potassium ions have a positive charge, 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.590
 but pumping three sodium ions out 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.150
 and two potassium inwards. 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.500
 This should make the outside 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.850
 more positive than the inside of the cell. " 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.361
 Actually it is. 

00:02:32.361 --> 00:02:34.620
 But not just the potassium-sodium pump is responsible for this fact. 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.000
 It plays only a partial role 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.370
 for the electrical potential difference 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.920
 between the inner 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.496
 and the outside of the membrane. 

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:45.290
 What is very important for the potential 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.432
 are the protein channels, 

00:02:47.432 --> 00:02:49.220
 which allow potassium ions 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.300
 to move in the direction of 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.730
 their concentration gradient. 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.130
 Think about what's going on 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.300
 before we talk 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.300
 for these protein channels. 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.250
 What is the concentration gradient of sodium 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.790
 due to the work of a potassium-sodium pump? 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.412
 The concentration of sodium from the outside 

00:03:04.412 --> 00:03:05.760
 is higher, 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.970
 and its concentration in the cell 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.260
 is smaller. 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.566
 This is the concentration gradient of sodium. 

00:03:13.566 --> 00:03:16.160
 What is the concentration gradient of potassium? 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.930
 Potassium is pumped from the outside into the interior 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.200
 of the cage. 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.290
 So potassium has a reverse concentration gradient. 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.060
 He has a high concentration inside 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.660
 and low concentration outside the cell. 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.880
 If we let the potassium pass through the membrane, 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.503
 are we talking about that in other videos, 

00:03:36.503 --> 00:03:38.670
 the ions can not simply pass 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.266
 through the membrane, 

00:03:40.266 --> 00:03:42.256
 if their transport is not relieved in any way. 

00:03:42.256 --> 00:03:45.156
 The membrane is not permeable to things like ions, 

00:03:45.156 --> 00:03:46.600
 such as sodium and potassium ions. 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.259
 But if we have protein channels here, 

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:51.386
 who run potassium 

00:03:51.386 --> 00:03:53.326
 to come out, what will happen? 

00:03:53.326 --> 00:03:55.266
 You can give one of the two answers. 

00:03:55.266 --> 00:03:55.966
 1. Can you say - 

00:03:55.966 --> 00:03:58.426
 things are transported by diffusion in the direction 

00:03:58.426 --> 00:03:59.836
 of their concentration gradient, 

00:03:59.836 --> 00:04:00.956
 because we have more 

00:04:00.956 --> 00:04:03.196
 potassium ions down here, 

00:04:03.196 --> 00:04:04.526
 there is a larger one 

00:04:04.526 --> 00:04:06.426
 probability 

00:04:06.426 --> 00:04:07.926
 to move from that to that country, 

00:04:07.926 --> 00:04:10.266
 than to this one. 

00:04:10.266 --> 00:04:14.056
 We will have a net leakage of potassium from the cell. 

00:04:14.056 --> 00:04:15.466
 2. But you can say that 

00:04:15.466 --> 00:04:16.896
 the first answer is valid if we are interested 

00:04:16.896 --> 00:04:19.075
 only by the concentration gradient. 

00:04:19.075 --> 00:04:21.086
 What will happen if we look at the charge? 

00:04:21.086 --> 00:04:23.730
 We say the inside of the cage 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.766
 will be less positive, 

00:04:27.956 --> 00:04:28.896
 and on the outside of the membrane medium 

00:04:28.896 --> 00:04:30.376
 will be more positive, 

00:04:30.376 --> 00:04:31.119
 because 

00:04:31.119 --> 00:04:33.156
 has a larger total ion charge, 

00:04:33.156 --> 00:04:37.556
 the appearance will be more positive. 

00:04:37.556 --> 00:04:39.786
 The same charges are required 

00:04:39.786 --> 00:04:41.616
 to move away from one another. 

00:04:41.616 --> 00:04:42.826
 Positive ions 

00:04:42.826 --> 00:04:44.856
 want to move on 

00:04:44.856 --> 00:04:46.526
 more negative places. 

00:04:46.526 --> 00:04:48.666
 These potassium ions 

00:04:48.666 --> 00:04:50.086
 are positively charged, 

00:04:50.086 --> 00:04:51.216
 why would they want to go from 

00:04:51.216 --> 00:04:54.886
 less positive in a more positive place? 

00:04:54.886 --> 00:04:57.026
 If you guessed any of these two things, 

00:04:57.026 --> 00:04:58.576
 the explanation with the concentration gradient 

00:04:58.576 --> 00:05:00.986
 or the difference in electrical potential, 

00:05:00.986 --> 00:05:03.946
 you are right in both cases. 

00:05:03.946 --> 00:05:06.086
 These two forces are balanced. 

00:05:06.086 --> 00:05:07.226
 Concentration gradient 

00:05:07.226 --> 00:05:08.286
 will allow some of the 

00:05:08.286 --> 00:05:10.826
 potassium ions leave the cell, 

00:05:10.826 --> 00:05:14.579
 but there is no potassium concentration 

00:05:14.579 --> 00:05:16.442
 to align on both sides of the membrane 

00:05:16.442 --> 00:05:19.688
 because of the difference in electric potential. 

00:05:19.688 --> 00:05:22.136
 The exterior is more positive, 

00:05:22.136 --> 00:05:23.323
 the interior is less positive. 

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:23.986
 When the potassium ions leave the cell, 

00:05:23.986 --> 00:05:25.236
 they move in the opposite direction 

00:05:25.236 --> 00:05:26.566
 to the one who wants their charge. 

00:05:26.566 --> 00:05:28.416
 They move in the direction of the concentration gradient, 

00:05:28.416 --> 00:05:31.666
 but at some point this will be balanced. 

00:05:31.666 --> 00:05:33.396
 Pumping 

00:05:33.396 --> 00:05:36.576
 sodium ions out 

00:05:36.576 --> 00:05:37.796
 in a higher ratio 

00:05:37.796 --> 00:05:39.616
 in comparison to that of the potassium ions pumped into the cell, 

00:05:39.616 --> 00:05:40.716
 is released 

00:05:40.716 --> 00:05:42.766
 yet positive charge outside the cage. 

00:05:42.766 --> 00:05:44.146
 The so-called 

00:05:44.146 --> 00:05:46.786
 membrane potential of rest. 

00:05:46.786 --> 00:05:48.486
 It is extremely important for all cells, 

00:05:48.486 --> 00:05:49.986
 but especially for nerve cells 

00:05:49.986 --> 00:05:51.856
 or neurons. 

00:05:51.856 --> 00:05:53.446
 They use it 

00:05:53.446 --> 00:05:54.790
 2/3 of its energy, 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:56.866
 to establish and preserve 

00:05:56.866 --> 00:05:58.436
 membrane potential of rest. 

00:05:58.436 --> 00:05:59.986
 As we will see in the neuron video, 

00:05:59.986 --> 00:06:02.086
 this is because they constantly use this potential, 

00:06:02.086 --> 00:06:04.696
 to transmit signals along the neuron. 

00:06:04.696 --> 00:06:06.346
 But the membrane potential of rest 

00:06:06.346 --> 00:06:08.116
 is less positive here and more positive here. 

00:06:08.116 --> 00:06:11.436
 If you measure that 

00:06:12.826 --> 00:06:15.286
 in comparison, 

00:06:15.286 --> 00:06:19.026
 this difference (depending on 

00:06:19.026 --> 00:06:20.236
 of the measurement) 

00:06:20.236 --> 00:06:24.386
 will be about -70 mV (millivolt). 

00:06:24.386 --> 00:06:26.996
 I've also seen measurements that indicate -60 or -80 mV. 

00:06:26.996 --> 00:06:30.266
 -70 mV. 

00:06:30.266 --> 00:06:32.003
 This potential is key to neurons 

00:06:32.003 --> 00:06:34.273
 and for all other cells. 

00:06:34.273 --> 00:06:35.593
 But the function of the potassium-sodium pump 

00:06:35.593 --> 00:06:37.853
 is not the only establishment of 

00:06:37.853 --> 00:06:39.823
 membrane potential of rest. 

00:06:39.823 --> 00:06:41.953
 Higher sodium concentration 

00:06:41.953 --> 00:06:44.793
 outside the cage can be used 

00:06:44.793 --> 00:06:47.223
 and in various forms of active transport. 

00:06:47.223 --> 00:06:49.113
 When sodium ions move in the direction of their concentration gradient, 

00:06:49.113 --> 00:06:50.223
 is possible 

00:06:50.223 --> 00:06:52.443
 to ship things like glucose molecules. 

00:06:52.443 --> 00:06:54.453
 In fact, these biological systems 

00:06:54.453 --> 00:06:55.733
 are much more complex, 

00:06:55.733 --> 00:06:58.563
 than we often portray them in our videos. 

00:06:58.563 --> 00:07:00.433
 But I want you to appreciate that 

00:07:00.433 --> 00:07:01.993
 and know how important it is 

00:07:01.993 --> 00:07:03.493
 potassium-sodium pump. 

00:07:03.493 --> 00:07:05.193
 It was known in the 1950s,
