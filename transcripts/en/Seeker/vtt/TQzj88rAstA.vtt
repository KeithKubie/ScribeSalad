00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.960
A long time ago a great disturbance was felt
in the force as millions of voices cried out

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.690
in terror, and were suddenly silenced. But
c'mon, could the Death Star really blow up

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:10.690
a planet?!

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:16.330
It’s Star Wars day, you guys (screams)

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.880
Hey jedis and siths, Trace Windu here for
DNews -- get it?

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.880
Like…

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:22.880
Mace?

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.880
Okay…

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.109
A key plot point in the original Star Wars
story was the destruction of the planet Alderaan

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.380
by the Death Star as a show of force to the
Rebel scum. Then, after the destruction, an

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.820
asteroid field formed around Alderaan's star,
but c'mon... would all this really happen?!

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.579
Yes, the movie is science fiction, but when
have we nerds ever let that stop us from sciencing

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:41.129
the sh*t out of something?

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.039
Okay, first we need to know how much energy
it takes to blow up a planet, then we can

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:50.280
work out if the Death Star can blow up something
so much bigger than itself. Alderaan is an

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.520
M-Class planet, right?

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.079
It's earth-like and similarly sized. Three
nerdy researchers at the University of Leicester

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.829
calculated how much power the Empire would
have to impart into the planet to get it to

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.659
overcome its own gravity and fly in all directions.
It's a really big number: 2 octillion joules.

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.490
The World Energy Consumption is only 56 billion
joules!

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.090
So these numbers are pretty difficult to fathom.
Let's put it in perspectives we can comprehend,

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.090
sort of…

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:23.990
The power of our whole sun is 380 septillion
joules, astronomers call this ONE solar luminosity.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.360
Ahh, small numbers.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:32.049
So, the energy required to blow up a planet,
according to these researchers would be 5.2

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.450
solar luminosities, or the amount of energy
of our Sun releases in a week. Which is pretty

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.750
insane. Phil Plait, Bad Astronomer and internet-winner
extraordinaire, says depending on the planet's

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.960
size though, it could be more like 582,000
solar luminosities!

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.140
That would take 57 quadrillion megaton nuclear
bombs to blow up!

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.290
I love me some Plait, but for the sake of
simplicity let's go with the students… we

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.409
want it the answer to be in reach, after all.

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.939
To generate all that energy, we need to understand
how the Death Star is powered. According to

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:09.440
authors in the Extended Universe, I know,
its hypermatter reactor is as powerful as

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.410
"several main-sequence stars." As we're basing
these numbers on our own Sun's power of one

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.989
solar luminosity, the Death Star may throw
power around equivalent to say seven of our

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.480
sun -- or seven solar luminosities!

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.629
THATS WAY MORE THAN the 5.2 needed to blow
up a planet!

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:32.200
Note: our sun is a relatively small main-sequence
star, so this is a pretty conservative estimate.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.370
But, it could be even easier than all that.
Shooting a big laser at a planet would just

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.860
heat it up -- and you'd have to get through
all that mass to reach the core and vaporize

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.470
it… very unlikely. Popular Mechanics got
a bunch of SciFi authors together and brainstormed

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.590
the problem. My favorite hypothesis is that
the superlaser fired by the Death Star is

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.090
positronic; a positron is a positively charged
antimatter twin of an electron!

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:03.390
If they fired a pure antimatter beam at Alderaan
it would cause massive matter-antimatter explosions!

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:09.450
When matter and antimatter meet, they annihilate
each other in a huge release of energy. Because

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.330
these antimatter-matter reactions are so powerful,
according to author Ethan Siegel, you'd only

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:22.159
need the amount of antimatter equivalent to
0.00000002 percent of the mass of the planet

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:23.159
being destroyed!

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:26.299
Even Phil Plait agrees that might do it!

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:27.299
But then what?

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.099
In 1977, George Lucas described Alderaan as
a planet in a system, it not exactly canon,

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:37.310
but other planets definitely exist. When the
Death Star's superlaser destroys it what happens

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.310
to those six other planets?

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.870
Not too much. Asteroids accelerated by the
release of heat and pressure from inside the

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.290
planet would shoot toward the outer reaches
of their solar system, but overall the Alderaan

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.879
system would be about the same… the mass
of the planet would distribute around a new

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:53.790
asteroid belt; and the system would move on…

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.439
Think of it like Mars' moon Phobos, it's set
to be torn asunder in the next 50 million

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:02.980
years, but it won't disrupt the orbit, the
mass is going to be pretty much the same.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.140
A quick wobble, then back to business as usual.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.730
Look, this is science fiction, it's a fanciful
story. But the best part about science is

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.810
it can make these stories feel more real.
Arthur C. Clarke's Third Law of Scientific

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.049
Prediction is, "Any sufficiently advanced
technology is indistinguishable from magic."

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.800
If the Empire can wield many times the power
of our whole sun in a single spacecraft -- it

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.250
would be like magic to us. But of course,
no matter how powerful the Death Star was,

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.729
it is insignificant, next to the power of
the Force. I'd like to thank Dr. Natalie Hinkel

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.550
for helping me with all this stellar math,
btw!

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:35.360
She's awesome.
