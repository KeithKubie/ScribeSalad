00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.520
So, the Parker Solar Probe is about to launch
and have its first solar flyby in November.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.980
We have plenty of fuel to do
another three, four, five years of mission.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.760
But, after that time the thrusters will burn out and ultimately it will become a sungrazing comet

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.660
And end its life melting in the solar corona.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.960
Whenever you look at something far away 
you're really seeing the light

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.460
which is summed up over all the path of 
everything that comes to you.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.160
Even observing the solar corona from afar you might ask, "why do we have to go with a solar probe?"

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.020
We can see the corona during eclipses. 
We know how to build coronagraphs.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.860
Well, the problem is that we can't really 
measure the magnetic field there.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.340
And the observations that we make are really a sum of the whole gas that exists between us and infinity.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.759
It's not a local measurement.  That's why we need to go.

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.349
The energy deposition occurs in bursts-- it's
not a continuous flow.

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:54.740
These bursts are equivalent to millions of hydrogen
bombs exploding per hour in the solar corona.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.400
That's what we're trying to understand.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.399
Even the defense departments of various nations in the world are beginning to deploy spacecraft whose

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.200
role is to monitor this, what we call space weather.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.500
Parker Solar Probe has a different goal. It wants
to go in to understand the basis.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.760
What does space weather depend on.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.460
So, Parker Solar Probe is going to start sending 
data back in bursts

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.740
because we can only send data back from the probe

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.060
when it's closer to Earth. When this data
comes down, we have already set up a

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.630
series of working groups for people
trying to study specific problems

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.500
specific data sets. And, of course, the
students that we have here at UCLA will

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.870
be involved in all aspects of this.
