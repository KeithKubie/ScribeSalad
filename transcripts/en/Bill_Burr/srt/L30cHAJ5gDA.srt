1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:04,890
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04,891 --> 00:00:07,540
Just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast and

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:15,630
just checking in on you. I'm just checking
in on you. This isn't even a podcast.

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,650
This is just me poking my head into
your cubicle or your office door.

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,860
You're fucking cardboard box wherever
you live in, wherever you work,

6
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,760
whatever you're doing.
Are you making American great again?

7
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,910
We go make it great again.

8
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,950
Remember what it was great
bad's going to happen again.

9
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:44,020
Making America great again.
Um,

10
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,560
what's going on? How are you?
I'm in a good mood. My, my,

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,250
my lovely daughter is entered a
new phase of just nonstop crying.

12
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,253
Ed.
Um,

13
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,430
I think she's going to be a ric flair
fan because the only thing I could do to

14
00:00:59,431 --> 00:01:04,320
get her to stop was,
you know those exercise balls that uh,

15
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,150
the ladies use them.
You know,

16
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,030
cause they're always trying to work their
glutes and their fucking thighs cause

17
00:01:09,031 --> 00:01:11,250
that's where they put the weight on.
You know,

18
00:01:11,251 --> 00:01:15,960
guys are always over there doing sit ups a
gate. Yeah. Yeah. Doing that shit. Right.

19
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,690
Do it shit from rocky hanging upside down.

20
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,800
Well maybe if I hang upside down
and fucking do a setup, you know,

21
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:25,950
that'll offset the fucking nine slices
of pizza I'm going to have tonight.

22
00:01:25,951 --> 00:01:29,610
The pizza wins. Okay. You
don't need to hang upside down.

23
00:01:29,611 --> 00:01:32,070
You don't even need to do fuck.
You don't really even need to do setups,

24
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,990
which you need to do is you need
to get some salads and you're like,

25
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,220
you got to start looking at bad food.

26
00:01:39,221 --> 00:01:43,140
Like it's some fucking check that you
know is great in the rack. Right. But it,

27
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,880
she's just, you can't bring it home to
your parents. She's a fucking lunatic.

28
00:01:45,881 --> 00:01:47,230
That's,
that's what bad food is.

29
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:51,690
And the food version of great in the rack
is salt, sugar high. That's all this,

30
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,210
right? Just send you shit through
the roof. You like, yeah. You know,

31
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,020
and you just keep grabbing one fucking
handful after another is something in the

32
00:01:59,021 --> 00:02:01,600
back of your head in the Becky
head is just screaming. No.

33
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,190
Like when you're dating a psycho,

34
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:09,550
why am I going to go out to a farmer's
market with this fucking lunatic?

35
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,240
Why am I pretending that
there's a relationship here?

36
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,170
Do you have a bag of chicken?

37
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:20,080
She's got a window right behind her bed
and halfway through bang, or you like,

38
00:02:20,081 --> 00:02:22,120
what am I just opened this
and we'll fucking crawl down?

39
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,880
Yeah, I'm sure women have thought
that. You know what I mean?

40
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:32,690
Blade on that backs getting fucking railed
by some sweaty fucking, I don't know,

41
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,970
Banker Assistant. And then
he's got a skylight. Go.

42
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:39,440
What if I was like Spiderman right now?
I could just some fucking webs.

43
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:42,800
It just go right up and out of here.
Leave them all confused.

44
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:48,170
Half excited on the bed. That's what they
need to have with the future. Everybody.

45
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:52,610
They're trying to have better cameras
on your cell. Phone's better recorders.

46
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,010
Fucking, I don't know. Something
else. Whatever the fuck are.

47
00:02:56,011 --> 00:02:59,030
They always have to be three examples.
So you fill in your last one.

48
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,380
This podcast will be interactive.
What did they come up with?

49
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:04,540
Something that when you're with
somebody, right, you could just,

50
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:07,390
you just hit a fucking eject button.
Look,

51
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:09,700
every house has like a fucking,

52
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,540
like even if you're on the bottom floor
and you just got to stand in the right

53
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:16,910
place and you remember those
old school offices would,

54
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,530
they would like send messages around
through that little fucking vacuum thing.

55
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:22,700
You know, you put the thing
in the tube, just do it.

56
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,660
Just disappear and go into
somebody else's office.

57
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:30,400
Sort of the original fucking emails.
They should have that for people you know

58
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,560
and yeah.
I'm telling you,

59
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:35,460
I didn't like the way you talked to my
sister and just remember we have that

60
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,720
data satellite Saturday and
you just, yeah, you just

61
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:43,740
go over to the fucking
portal and you just gone, hi.

62
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,290
Hi honey. Stop it. You're scaring me.

63
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,200
Hello. You still there? She walks
over and need just fucking gone.

64
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:59,700
Then it'd be the new thing instead
of getting dumped. You got port hold.

65
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:05,910
What's wrong with Maggie Paul?
She got porn hold right in the middle.

66
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,180
I think she was nagging him. You
know how Maggie is? She's very,

67
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:14,040
very particular and she, she, I
know. I love her too. I love her too,

68
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:18,690
but she can be hot. She can
be. She's a lot. She, she is.

69
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,730
And then that's when the other
girlfriends go. She gets a lot.

70
00:04:20,731 --> 00:04:22,040
She's definitely a lot,
you know,

71
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,710
and then they fucking clink their little
fucking glass at Rosie, whatever it is.

72
00:04:25,711 --> 00:04:29,700
Women doing the afternoon, ladies,
what do you do in the afternoon?

73
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,640
What does that little wind break you take?
You know,

74
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:38,530
like you fucking Ernest Hemingway, you
know, that's what I want to say. Uh,

75
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,390
I got it. I'm going to say something like
that at that writer's thing on Sunday.

76
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,290
Just talking about how much I booze now,
because I fucking sit in a writer's room

77
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,670
anyway,
so going through that keeps my,

78
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,540
my daughter quiet during this
phase that she's going through,

79
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:56,180
which is fucking awesome.
Even though she's crying her
brains out now. She's like,

80
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,770
she's like looking at Shit, you know,
she's like taking it in and everything.

81
00:05:00,771 --> 00:05:04,430
It's an amazing thing, right?
So we got this exercise ball.

82
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,220
The thing that the ladies have right now,

83
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,060
maybe someone like Bill Clinton who
puts on weight like a bitch, right? Um,

84
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,140
lemme just big milky
fucking thighs. The, uh,

85
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,760
is during his first semester,

86
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,460
whatever the fuck they call it is
first trimester of being president.

87
00:05:19,461 --> 00:05:23,430
Remember that Shit when he'd go
jogging in those fucking short shorts,

88
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:27,320
um, all I do anyways, uh,

89
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,490
you sit on that exercise ball okay.
And you bounce up and down.

90
00:05:31,491 --> 00:05:34,160
And the only thing that keeps it
quiet as if I just, if I don't want,

91
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,660
I'm bouncing up and down.
If I just keep going,

92
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,190
whoo,
whoo.

93
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,600
You know?
And as much as it was driving me nuts,

94
00:05:43,601 --> 00:05:47,590
as much as I was feeling my old spine
compacting, every time we went down,

95
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,010
um,
I held out this,

96
00:05:51,011 --> 00:05:55,000
this glimmer of hope that maybe she's
going to be Rick Flair Fan, ric flair fan.

97
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:59,120
It's not easy to say. So anyways,
um, how was your Thursday?

98
00:05:59,121 --> 00:06:00,870
You're almost there to get,

99
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,640
they give you a paycheck yet that was
always the best. You get your paycheck,

100
00:06:04,641 --> 00:06:08,400
then you go out for lunch. Right. Do,
do you want to get a beer? Which I want,

101
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,300
but just have one. We'll
just have one. You know,

102
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:16,580
that whole fucking thing. What the
fuck is it? You know what it is?

103
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,910
Is Quality of life I would say.
What is it about life that you just can't,

104
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,420
you can 90% of the time you're not
doing what you want to be doing.

105
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,123
You know?

106
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:32,060
If there was no, I guess if there was
no infrastructure or assist society,

107
00:06:32,061 --> 00:06:35,180
man, we probably only
live for fucking 30 years,

108
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:38,540
but just imagine but 30 years you could
do whatever the fuck you want but then

109
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:41,060
no one would have done anything and no
one want to taking the time to make a

110
00:06:41,061 --> 00:06:44,480
beer factory so then you wouldn't
have a bar and then what would you do?

111
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,550
You'd just be sitting around trying
not to get eaten by animals. All right,

112
00:06:49,551 --> 00:06:50,360
so are,
there we go.

113
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,630
We just figured out why you have to go
to work every week but isn't Thursday

114
00:06:53,631 --> 00:06:55,970
exciting? I think that's the
point I'm trying to make here.

115
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,870
Thursday's are exciting because they
give you that piece of paper with the

116
00:06:59,871 --> 00:07:04,010
numbers on it and then you write your
name on the back of it and then you go

117
00:07:04,011 --> 00:07:06,170
down to those fucking crooked banker cons.

118
00:07:06,171 --> 00:07:09,710
You give them that piece of paper with
the numbers on it and then they give you

119
00:07:09,711 --> 00:07:13,520
a piece of paper back that added
more numbers to the numbers that were

120
00:07:13,521 --> 00:07:17,150
previously on that piece of paper.
And then you walk around buying shit.

121
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,583
Isn't that what you do?

122
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,370
Okay.

123
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,450
I have no fucking idea.

124
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,910
That was another thing I liked about that
old guy who smoked 12 cigars a day and

125
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:29,940
he lived east 109 he's still going like
one of the oldest World War II veterans

126
00:07:29,941 --> 00:07:34,350
out there. Um, what I liked about
him was he paid cash for everything,

127
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,210
paid cash for everything,
you know, just completely,

128
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:40,620
you know,

129
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,920
I wonder if you just slip through the
cracks after awhile you came into this

130
00:07:44,921 --> 00:07:49,060
world and you just paid
cash for everything and you
never went on the Internet.

131
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:50,643
You know,

132
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,430
somebody is still take a fucking selfie
with you. And then that would be it.

133
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,080
Everybody,
like,

134
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,200
who is this guy who is this mysterious
guy that's never been on the Internet and

135
00:07:59,201 --> 00:08:01,960
pays cash for everything?
You know,

136
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,930
all the advertising world
would be all obsessed.

137
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,220
We don't know what kind of toothpaste
to use as we can't have that

138
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:13,990
start to fucking spying on him
was like a drone and shit. Um,

139
00:08:13,991 --> 00:08:16,090
I don't know what's going on here.
I just had a bowl of cereal.

140
00:08:16,091 --> 00:08:18,190
Maybe that's what it is.
I thought it was a healthy bowl.

141
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,700
Do you guys like the checks? Family of
cereals? I'm big on the checks families.

142
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:26,080
Speaking of which so many cereals
have just fucking disappeared.

143
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:30,130
When my wife was pregnant, when
she was pregnant. Oh my God.

144
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:36,450
Um, when she was pregnant, um,

145
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,910
she was requesting all these fucking
cereals, you know, from back in the day.

146
00:08:41,911 --> 00:08:44,800
For some reason I'm thinking they'd be
the ending of Star Trek right now. Right.

147
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:45,923
Wow.

148
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,390
She wanted alphabets. They don't
fucking make those anymore. Some,

149
00:08:51,391 --> 00:08:55,800
some how you can go to target,
you know, that involves,

150
00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:00,090
that involves like, you know, going into
a mall. It's one of those anchor stores,

151
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,990
you know, which is the goal of
anybody with the small business.

152
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,080
Someday I'm going to be an
anchor store and a fucking mall,

153
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,930
then then I'll be happy.
Right.

154
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:14,670
And you got to fucking deal with the
parking garage and then you like following

155
00:09:14,671 --> 00:09:18,210
somebody like a serial killer, is it
trying to get back to their fucking car?

156
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,780
And then they get in there and they start
checked in the text messages and the

157
00:09:21,781 --> 00:09:26,160
person behind you starts beeping and
it just becomes like, you know what?

158
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:29,280
It just becomes one of those things where
you just had to be like, you know what?

159
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:34,890
Fuck this cereal. Fuck
alphabets. Fuck booberry count.

160
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:40,890
Chocula Frankenberry sugar corn smacks,
honeycomb. Fuck all of these cereals.

161
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,710
I don't know where they are anymore.
You know what they're like,

162
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:48,180
they're like old music acts that
play casinos. You know what I mean?

163
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,210
Like loverboy.

164
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,100
Yeah,

165
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,640
there's somewhere right now, this
weekend, and they're going to sing.

166
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:00,500
Everybody's working for the weekend right
there somewhere. Do, do, do, do, do,

167
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,553
do, do, do

168
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,400
you want a piece of my heart?

169
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:11,980
Tell me that lead singer didn't kind of
look like Dan Marino back in the day. Um,

170
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:17,020
anyways, that's why I like old cereal is
like, they're, they're on the casino tour.

171
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:21,820
Did Not grow up my grocery stores as
far as serial goes. Food in general.

172
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:23,440
When you're in all the grocery stores,

173
00:10:23,441 --> 00:10:26,770
that's you're at the height of your
career, right? You're Bruno Mars,

174
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,730
you doing the fucking prince
thing at the grammys, right?

175
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,640
And then somewhere, you
know, but you're on the deer,

176
00:10:33,641 --> 00:10:36,440
right at the fucking mid level
shelf to your headline, headlining,

177
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,400
maybe even the top shelf,
but right at fucking eyeball level,

178
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:43,030
whatever average hiatus,
you're right fucking there.

179
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:47,080
Sandwiched between the CEC cereals of uh,

180
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:51,310
check family of cereals. And then you've
got the corn flakes on the other side.

181
00:10:51,311 --> 00:10:53,470
You're right there.
You're big stupid fucking face.

182
00:10:53,471 --> 00:10:57,010
And whenever sugary Horse Shit,
you're selling to the public, right?

183
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,880
And then somewhere along the line he,
it just, you know, you run out of hits,

184
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,640
you collaborate with the wrong people,

185
00:11:03,641 --> 00:11:08,380
people's palettes change and then
you get, you get, you get pushed out,

186
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,323
you know?

187
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:11,340
Yeah.

188
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,990
You start going to those places where,
you know,

189
00:11:12,991 --> 00:11:16,740
you can only get them in certain cities.
You are only in target like Michelob.

190
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,313
MMM.

191
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,400
Michelob light,
Michelob light.

192
00:11:21,401 --> 00:11:24,820
The only place I've been able to buy
that was in the city of New Orleans.

193
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:29,440
Once Michelob ultra came along, it just
completely fucked over Michelob light.

194
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:33,010
I don't know where it went.
So first beer I ever got drunk on.

195
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:34,930
I love that beer.

196
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,760
I love me some make a low black and um,

197
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,360
I dunno. I don't know what
the fuck I'm talking about.

198
00:11:43,361 --> 00:11:46,270
I was just asking the guys you'd
like to check cereals. You know,

199
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:50,200
I didn't want to do a whole eighties
fucking comedy routine on cereal. Did I?

200
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,510
You know, I'll fuck it. Let's keep going.

201
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:57,310
Then he got Wheaties is like the Frank
Sinatra, you know, like the rat pack.

202
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:01,120
Like they're never going away. They're
timeless. Fucking classics, you know,

203
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:03,340
fly me to the moon.

204
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,570
It is fucking shit.
That's really not good for you.

205
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:12,090
Fucking Bruce Jenner didn't eat this.
That's not why he won the gold medal.

206
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:18,870
In other words, he's a whore. Um, anyways,

207
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:23,050
he got Wheaties. What are the classics?
Grape nuts. They're hanging in there.

208
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:26,440
They're on the bottom shelf. Grape
nuts. His bottom shelf. You know,

209
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,540
they're still there. They're still
playing the fucking, you know,

210
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:32,050
the play in the big rooms,
but not the Abrams, you know,

211
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,980
was another one that's hung around for
a long fucking time. Brighten up flakes.

212
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,880
So the Billy Carter of the fucking
grape nut family. All right.

213
00:12:39,881 --> 00:12:41,500
I'm done with this fucking
shit. Anyways, let's,

214
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,380
let's talk about what's really
important out there. Nick Depaulo,

215
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:51,200
one of the fucking greatest comics I've
ever seen is new special is on right now

216
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:56,140
on Seeso T. I actually at 8:00 PM tonight,
you got to fucking watch this thing.

217
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:58,840
You don't have to,
but I would really appreciate if you did,

218
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,470
it's called inflammatory.
It's debuting today,

219
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,430
February 16th at 8:00 PM on Seeso TV,

220
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:11,460
s e s o a TV to subscribe
to his pod podcast.

221
00:13:13,211 --> 00:13:14,230
Just go to connect

222
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:22,210
pal.com/nick all lowercase connect pals,
c o n n e c t p a

223
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,780
l.com/nick. Um, that's what I'm
doing. I don't know what you're doing,

224
00:13:28,781 --> 00:13:30,820
but that's what the fuck I'm doing.
Um,

225
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,750
oh Joey roses also has a
special on comedy central,

226
00:13:34,751 --> 00:13:37,990
but comedy central is weird cause
they don't stream. They're not weird.

227
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,930
They're old school. You know
what I mean? You know what?

228
00:13:40,931 --> 00:13:44,770
They're not streaming anymore.
So that channel there at target right now

229
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:50,500
and Netflix,
Netflix elbowed him out.

230
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:54,310
See sews elbow there that
they're the new, the new, uh,

231
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,840
though they like the millennials
of fucking TV networks
and they just cut in all

232
00:13:58,841 --> 00:14:03,370
these cons out, you know, and these other
guy, right? A kid you had to buy cable,

233
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:07,390
Eh, yard to watch
commercials. Um, all right,

234
00:14:07,391 --> 00:14:10,990
there's the elephant in the room and I
have to address and I know every fucking

235
00:14:10,991 --> 00:14:15,490
French content from Montreal
with your silly socks. Oh,
you're clapping right now,

236
00:14:15,491 --> 00:14:19,460
aren't ya? Huh. All right.

237
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:24,280
So as I, you know, not
everybody saw it coming.

238
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:28,540
You knew a Clo Julian was going to take
the fall for some of the moves that

239
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:32,830
we've made and uh, you know, it,

240
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:37,810
and I was saying the entire fucking time
that this guy wanted us our first cup

241
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:41,650
and 40 years, you know, um,

242
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:47,140
why are we blaming this fucking guy? Yada,
Yada, Yada. Please don't fucking fire.

243
00:14:47,141 --> 00:14:49,300
And what do they do? They
fire him. So I tweeted out,

244
00:14:49,301 --> 00:14:54,110
congratulations to any NHL team out there
that's looking for a great coach that

245
00:14:54,111 --> 00:14:58,730
knows how to win a cup. All
right. Now having said that,

246
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,050
I had no fucking idea.

247
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:05,200
I ain't no fucking idea
that the Montreal Canadians,

248
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,930
we're going to fire
their coach was a Tarion.

249
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:12,310
They fired him all right.
And fucking picked him up.

250
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,200
And um, as much as I hate to say this
is a Bruins fan, we fucking deserve it.

251
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,770
You know, I dunno. You know what
happens is everybody does it. They,

252
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:24,260
they were doing well with Pat Burns at
Pat Burns. Got fucking sick of them.

253
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,740
I always thought pat one a copy then
86 and 93 with him. I guess he didn't,

254
00:15:27,741 --> 00:15:31,850
he existed in the middle
like don Mattingly. Um,

255
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:33,330
yeah.

256
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:37,140
And um, I dunno, I have no idea, but
I think I'm going to say right now,

257
00:15:37,141 --> 00:15:42,110
the Canadians are going to win a cup with
Cloe. Julian, if before you get excited,

258
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,130
you want for your fans.
If they will want a cup,

259
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:48,030
if they're dumb ass fans in the media,
don't run them out of town first.

260
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,830
God knows they love doing that.

261
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,880
Fucking dopes have you concept there.
You know what I mean?

262
00:15:53,881 --> 00:15:56,580
Why don't you get out there and skate
around for the little fucking pocket

263
00:15:56,581 --> 00:16:00,390
square fucking bitch
moaning and complaining.

264
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:04,890
The most arrogant fans on the
face of the fucking earth.

265
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,070
Without a fucking doubt.
Montreal Canadien fans.

266
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:12,510
New York fans are pretty bad, but there's
just something about him did dumb.

267
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,440
You just hear it.

268
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:16,440
They fucking breathe through their
mouths to eat big sandwiches.

269
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,990
They walk around in sweatpants that get,
you know,

270
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,820
a guy like Paul Versey you consider
considers dressing up, Eh, uh,

271
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:27,030
putting on a new pair of jeans and
some Air Jordans and a sweater.

272
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,710
I swear to God, if Paul put
that outfit on, he'd be like,

273
00:16:31,711 --> 00:16:34,890
I'm ready to meet the president.
Okay, that's your average New Yorker.

274
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:39,510
But they've written so many songs blowing
that city that people think they're a

275
00:16:39,511 --> 00:16:43,680
cut above just cause they, you know,
their parents had unprotected sex there.

276
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:47,010
You know all those songs.
Yeah. Phi can make it.

277
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,440
Dad Do, will you? Will
you make it anywhere?

278
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,290
Most New Yorkers can't even
live outside of New York.

279
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:59,160
They have a fucking panic attack. The
second they get out of the two, one, two,

280
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,880
seven, one eight fucking
area code, they're horrific.

281
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,330
They hold onto it like they move out
here to La and they keep wearing this

282
00:17:06,331 --> 00:17:09,660
stupid fucking New York badge.
You know,

283
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,770
like some washed up athletes still
wearing his highschool fucking jacket.

284
00:17:13,771 --> 00:17:17,040
They just keep, they come out to La and
all they do is shit all over. It's like,

285
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:21,360
go back. You're dumb cunt. You know,
you're going to go back. You're out here.

286
00:17:21,361 --> 00:17:25,850
Why don't you enjoy it? The learn how
to surf. Go have a fucking Burrito.

287
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:30,590
Go on a hike. I'll write already
with the fucking New York Shit. Oh,

288
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:33,220
the Adh fucking plays where
you get the fucking linguine.

289
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:38,150
You're the fucking 78
can fucking if today. Um,

290
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:41,300
I don't know. Look, I'm fucking,

291
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:44,530
I'm not going to take responsibility for
anything that I say in this podcast. Um,

292
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,980
first of all because, uh, I'm not an
adult and second of all, because, uh,

293
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,930
the lack of sleep I've
had recently, um, yeah,

294
00:17:52,931 --> 00:17:56,250
so the New York fence, this, there's still
an element of the, of just, you know,

295
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,400
they're morons. They're like
Boston fence, Philly fans.

296
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,690
We're all mouth breathing fucking
morons now. The Canadian fans, okay.

297
00:18:03,691 --> 00:18:06,510
The Canadian fans, because they
don't live in the United States,

298
00:18:06,511 --> 00:18:07,410
they live in Canada.

299
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:10,620
They actually have to take the time
to learn about other countries.

300
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,770
You know what I mean? Which makes
them appear to be more intelligent.

301
00:18:13,771 --> 00:18:14,550
But I'll tell you,

302
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:17,400
there's some of the most racist
fucking people I ever met in my life.

303
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:21,240
They lose a playoff series. They burned
down their fucking city. They ran,

304
00:18:21,241 --> 00:18:25,350
Patrick was out of town. Okay? The
fucking Hornets nest that closed.

305
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,610
Julian just stepped into,

306
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,810
if they can somehow keep those people
at bay and this stupid ass media,

307
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,270
the fucking media,
those Fed Fox,

308
00:18:33,271 --> 00:18:36,330
like they're gonna go out there and start
skating if they don't run him out of

309
00:18:36,331 --> 00:18:37,470
town.
I'm telling you right now,

310
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:42,390
if all of you fucking
Montreal counts can give,

311
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:46,200
just keep you fucking Yap shut.
Okay,

312
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,830
go buy yourself another pair of
loafers and some silly fucking socks.

313
00:18:49,831 --> 00:18:53,160
If he can just shut your fucking
mouth and stop acting like,

314
00:18:53,161 --> 00:18:57,870
you know how to run a team, this guy could
bring your cup. I'd say you got a 50,

315
00:18:57,871 --> 00:18:59,940
50 chance cause they're not
gonna be able to, they, you know,

316
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,850
they can't sit on their hands.
They can't,

317
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,690
they speak French. You know, there's
something about speaking French.

318
00:19:06,691 --> 00:19:10,020
All of a sudden you think you know stuff.
Unless you're in France,

319
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,510
I want to go to France. So those
people are cool. You got to Montreal.

320
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,780
I don't know what the deal is.
Um,

321
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,620
so much of that was just
absolute misinformation and
I really enjoyed all of it.

322
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,420
Um, you know what?
Congratulations to quote Julian.

323
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,420
I'm really happy we went to another
original 16. I hate the fucking Canadians,

324
00:19:27,421 --> 00:19:30,940
but I'm adult enough to not,
uh, to not sit there. I mean,

325
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,840
I hope he wins another fucking cup.
I don't want the Canadians to do it,

326
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:37,110
but I liked him too much to,
to have to fucking root against them.

327
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,890
I will only root against him when it's
hard because he's with the Canadians.

328
00:19:40,891 --> 00:19:43,530
But like, obviously if the
Bruins are playing, I'm going
to root against them. But,

329
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,350
uh, he's just a fucking
class act, you know,

330
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,880
he said he's going to
keep the rivalry going on,

331
00:19:47,881 --> 00:19:51,840
but he said something nice
about the players and all
of that. And uh, we'll see.

332
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:56,040
We'll see. The only thing that
can screw this up is the moron,

333
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:01,140
Canadian fans and their media. You know,
if you can run Patrick out of town,

334
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:06,510
maybe this ends the curse, the curse of
Patrick Walk, who knows? We shall see.

335
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,900
But uh, I just became a,
when he went to Montreal,

336
00:20:09,901 --> 00:20:13,680
I just became a huge penguins
and Washington capitol Fan.

337
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:20,580
I will be rooting hard, not against cloud.
I just don't want to see the fucking,

338
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,470
I love that they haven't won one in 20,
24 fucking years.

339
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:29,100
They're going on a quarter of a century
for any other franchise that's totally

340
00:20:29,101 --> 00:20:30,840
acceptable,
but not for them.

341
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:35,730
They have to win a cup.
That's all they have.

342
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,440
This is what one thing have sympathy.
I will say actually I, you know,

343
00:20:40,441 --> 00:20:43,710
I love the city Montreal. I'm fucking
around with you guys. Beautiful women.

344
00:20:43,711 --> 00:20:48,711
And you guys got fucked in 1994 and that
would have been so for baseball if the

345
00:20:49,271 --> 00:20:52,210
Montreal expos even made it to a
world series, forget about winning.

346
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,960
I'm winning the whole damn thing. And they
had a young Pedro Young Randy Johnson.

347
00:20:55,961 --> 00:20:59,530
I mean they were fucking stacked.
And um,

348
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,890
I love nationally baseball.
My whole time growing up,

349
00:21:02,891 --> 00:21:06,760
whenever I used to watch this week in
baseball, it was always a faster game.

350
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,220
It was hit and run.
They had all the astro turf,

351
00:21:09,221 --> 00:21:13,720
which I thought was cool when I was a
kid. And uh, you know, I will, you know,

352
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,270
I watch the Red Sox,
we were all American league.

353
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:22,270
We QC just keep signing one fucking
home run, hit her after another,

354
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:25,720
another lefty. I'll tell you if
this guy please in Fenway park,

355
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:29,500
he's going to hit 80 home runs. And all
he did was just ground into double place.

356
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,830
Like the pitcher doesn't know
why he was brought to town.

357
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:38,610
They just fucking low and inside high
and inside those kinds always loved those

358
00:21:38,611 --> 00:21:41,040
pitches. Low. The low
ball, they'd fucking,

359
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:43,830
whatever the fuck they would do at
sync around my a big baseball guy,

360
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:47,940
they'd always would ground out and then
they just work them right up the ladder

361
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:50,760
in that fucking high heat on the inside.
They could never lay off.

362
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,670
It's g three into the attic.

363
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:57,910
Red sox leaving another six rudders
stranded. It's not possible,

364
00:21:57,911 --> 00:22:01,720
but that's what it felt like two runners.
Right. All right. All right. Whatever.

365
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,320
I was never good at math. All right, let's

428
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:55,150
alright. Indochino Indochina, uh,

429
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:59,660
talk about how a man made to measure
suit fits compared to a generic off the

430
00:25:59,661 --> 00:26:03,800
rack suit. Well, isn't that
self explanatory? You know,

431
00:26:03,801 --> 00:26:05,720
unless you're a mannequin measurements,

432
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,133
right?

433
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,710
Which you're really weird now.
You know what I mean?

434
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,860
They got like the shredded ones.

435
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:15,650
They finally don't just
have all white mannequins.

436
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:19,970
They blood other races of people you know,
that aren't allowed,

437
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,270
that aren't alive to be allowed
to fucking model clothes. Um,

438
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,750
I don't need to talk about
what the, obviously, hey,

439
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,330
if he just grabbed a random fucking suit,
that sort of fits.

440
00:26:29,331 --> 00:26:33,950
Is that not as good as having one?
That's fucking Taylormade. It don't,

441
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:38,270
shadow is one of the largest
made to measure men's wear.
Brands get high quality.

442
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:42,000
Get a high quality suit made to your
exact measurements for a perfect fit yet

443
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:44,070
then you've got to stop eating well,
not stop it.

444
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:47,370
And you've got to keep your calorie
intake the exact fucking same way you can

445

Shut those fuckers out.
Four to, nothing for to zip.

519
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:39,970
I didn't realize Tuukka Rask. It was
like, oh nine in three at the TD bank.

520
00:31:39,971 --> 00:31:43,330
North Garden lifetime against
the Canadians. I had no idea.

521
00:31:43,331 --> 00:31:45,400
He had never won at home.
That's fucking weird to me.

522
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,750
My baby was the other guy. Can't
remember his name was that goaltender.

523
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:51,720
We won the fucking cop.

524
00:31:51,721 --> 00:31:54,570
The guy would go to the White House and
then took a year off to go find himself.

525
00:31:54,571 --> 00:31:58,170
And then I never heard from him again.
I think you went to the panthers.

526
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:03,750
Anyways, let's fucking plow ahead
here. Shall We? Um, oh Billy,

527
00:32:03,751 --> 00:32:06,510
no booze.
No cigars is still fucking cruising along.

528
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:11,130
I took my life insurance test
and a fucking guy took blood.

529
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,840
Jesus Creek, he was, I
couldn't find the vein.

530
00:32:12,841 --> 00:32:17,250
He fucking hacked up my arm big time.
That's going to bruise a little bit.

531
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:21,840
And you know what he was
right. But anyways, I kind
of liken not smoking cigars.

532
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:26,190
I haven't smoked since last
year. I like saying that. So, um,

533
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:30,870
I think I'm gonna go on, go on a little
run, you know, no booze, no cigar.

534
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,460
I'll tell you a kid.
We'll keep your fucking sober,

535
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:34,363
you know,

536
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:38,750
instead of looking fondly for that
fucking glass of Scotch at night.

537
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:41,450
Now are you thinking about is oh my God,
when this kid goes to sleep,

538
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,370
when this go kid goes to sleep,

539
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,490
I'm going to sleep and I am going to
have to log on to treat all fucking not

540
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:47,603
away.
That's all I,

541
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:51,320
that's all I care about right now is just
getting a little bit of sleep. But uh,

542
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,790
but it's been fucking awesome man.

543
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:56,900
I'm already watched and change in
watching now. When she looks at stuff,

544
00:32:56,901 --> 00:32:59,360
she could really like kind of take it in.

545
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:03,500
And I was still waiting for
the first smile. I still
think it's, she just has gas.

546
00:33:03,501 --> 00:33:05,780
If she's going to the bathroom.
Um,

547
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,710
he started smiling and he think
they're smiling at you and you're like,

548
00:33:09,711 --> 00:33:11,900
oh my God, you smelling
me? And then you know,

549
00:33:11,901 --> 00:33:14,750
you kind of drift out of their line of
vision to see if they're still looking at

550
00:33:14,751 --> 00:33:18,540
you and then they just continue looking
where your head was. It's just like, oh,

551
00:33:18,541 --> 00:33:22,070
all right, I guess you're
not. Um, so anyways,

552
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:26,870
so if I'd done my contractually obligation
obligated 33 minutes, 30 minutes,

553
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:31,220
whatever the fuck I'm supposed to do on
this. Um, by the way, still loving my car.

554
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:36,950
I'm loving it more than ever. I
had to put my truck in storage. Uh,

555
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:40,520
so what I do is on the weekends I
just drive my car over to the storage.

556
00:33:40,521 --> 00:33:45,040
I switched them out and um,
eventually, eventually my next, uh,

557
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:48,140
my next house,
cause the layout of my house.

558
00:33:48,141 --> 00:33:51,410
I don't know if this is going to work
with one kid or if we decide to have

559
00:33:51,411 --> 00:33:54,350
another one. I don't know if it's
gonna work out because it's either,

560
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,270
we're upstairs in the kids downstairs,

561
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:59,120
we're downstairs and the kids upstairs
and it just doesn't fucking work out.

562
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:02,540
So I don't know. Maybe I'll have to move.
I have no idea. But I will tell you this,

563
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:06,980
the next fucking place that I move,
I don't give a fuck about a view I'll,

564
00:34:06,981 --> 00:34:11,981
I give a shit about is a fucking driveway
that you know is act that isn't built

565
00:34:14,691 --> 00:34:18,140
for a model t fucking fort that
is built from modern day cars.

566
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:22,370
I would love to have the
fucking circle driveway.

567
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:24,710
You know those people like on Dallas

568
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:31,220
[inaudible] mandate a big fucking ranch,
you know,

569
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:35,480
they have their own fucking street just
driving all the way down there and I'm

570
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:39,620
just have anything, a little carport
someplace in my truck that, that is,

571
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:41,960
that's all I don't give. I mean,
when I pictured my dream house,

572
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:46,760
I don't even think about the house.
All I think about is to driveway,

573
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,950
the garage,
the garage.

574
00:34:48,951 --> 00:34:52,970
I got a gym and I got a
fucking a little drum room,

575
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,063
you know,

576
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:58,940
and I got a place in my truck and my
car and when I come out I don't have to

577
00:34:58,941 --> 00:35:02,120
move like 20 fucking cars
to get my fucking car on.

578
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,230
I don't have to move 20 guys have
to move my car, my wife's car.

579
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:08,780
But I feel like a valet, you know,
that's all I give a shit about.

580
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:09,441
I don't give a,

581
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:12,290
I don't give a fuck about the rest of
the house that the rest of the house is

582
00:35:12,291 --> 00:35:16,160
for your wife. They liked
that shit. This social. Okay.

583
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:21,050
Men need to get away from shit. If I can
have in this fucking garage. All right.

584
00:35:21,051 --> 00:35:24,860
If I can just have a little place where
I can work out and I got a place where I

585
00:35:24,861 --> 00:35:28,450
can play drums and I got my old
truck and I got my car. I mean,

586
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:32,240
what the fuck else do I need?
You know, right there. I'm good.

587
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:38,230
Like I actually think my dream house
is just a garage with a room above it,

588
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:43,050
you know? And the garage has
enough room for two cars.

589
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:47,490
A modern in a classic. The back
is the gym and then the drum room.

590
00:35:47,491 --> 00:35:51,870
And then upstairs is a little fucking
kitchen. Flatscreen TV, right.

591
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:58,170
Little fucking humidor and whatever the
fuck else you need do. Maybe that's,

592
00:35:58,171 --> 00:36:00,930
you know, something. All this
whole downsizing in life.

593
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:05,390
That's a fucking great idea.
Oh Shit.

594
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:09,290
That fucking divorce guy's house.

595
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,810
That's all it is. And you just
make an entire fucking street,

596
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:18,680
you know, so they can still
make the child support payments.

597
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,990
They can still pay their
alimony and all they,

598
00:36:20,991 --> 00:36:23,930
all these fucking women out there
whining about how they know, hey,

599
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:28,520
I don't make as much money. Yeah, you
do. You get your check and his check.

600
00:36:28,521 --> 00:36:32,620
So many of you do and you're still going
to those fucking rallies standing out

601
00:36:32,621 --> 00:36:37,520
in the rain, listening
to Alicia keys. Yeah.

602
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:42,160
The fuck out of here. Um, what Nia,

603
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,010
everything that I've said,
you're going to stare at me for that.

604
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:48,190
They need to listen to this
idea. Come here. Come here.

605
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,493
Yeah.

606
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:56,410
Oh, come on. Don't be like that.
Can we? I have a great idea.

607
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:02,140
She goes, don't be like what
an asshole like you. Ooh,
what are we at the bus stop?

608
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,333
Come here.

609
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:07,630
I'm saying that that insult was on the
level of somebody standing at a bus stop.

610
00:37:07,631 --> 00:37:12,120
I'll look at the blue QT cakes. What
do you say to I love on softer feeding.

611
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:15,970
Huh? You have a daughter now. So what
does that mean? You know what that means?

612
00:37:15,971 --> 00:37:19,060
Yeah, it means I have to be extra funny
cause now I got two of you ladies.

613
00:37:19,061 --> 00:37:22,210
I'm paying for her. You funny is
this, is this what you consider funny?

614
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:26,260
Move out of the way. I want
to put it down. Don't kiss
me and try to make it cute.

615
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,660
Oh, shut up. Listen to me and sit down.

616
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:32,950
I get an idea to force
the divorce guys house.

617
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,153
Okay.

618
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:35,450
All right.

619
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:40,450
So all it is is it's a two car garage
in the back there's a little gym.

620
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:45,680
If you play drums like me,
there's a little drum room
and above it is just this,

621
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:49,970
just like almost like a loft and that's
your kitchen, your flat screen TV,

622
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:52,160
your bed.
Just the only thing that you need.

623
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,650
Because when I think of our dream house,
I don't even think of the house. That's,

624
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,150
that's all I want.
Is that,

625
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,610
do you think that would work if I had
a whole street of fucking divorce,

626
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:03,650
divorce guys, they're all paying
alimony. All play child support.

627
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:07,990
All you strong women go into court. You
go to a woman, I can't afford to do,

628
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:12,200
what am I going to do in the real world
and they have to give no idea when

629
00:38:12,201 --> 00:38:16,180
anybody goes through and divorce and
having to get alimony or any of that kind

630
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:19,480
of stuff. So yes I do. Cause I've
divorced, man. I've talked to divorcement.

631
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:20,080
You talked,

632
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,140
have you talked to any divorce women
about it or are you just on one side? Yes,

633
00:38:23,141 --> 00:38:26,290
I did. Oh, I talked to a
lot of them on Rodeo drive,

634
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,150
man. The money, the money,

635
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:36,010
I get my check and I get his fucking
check to town. Curse in front of the baby.

636
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:40,480
Okay. A man, the money, I'm in the money,

637
00:38:40,481 --> 00:38:45,040
I get my check and I get his
freaking too. That's better. Huh?

638
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:49,150
You like that? That was take two. You guys
just got the extra the outtake. Alright.

639
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:53,180
Um, oh, look it up. Look up
cute cheese. All right. Um,

640
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,690
I gotta I gotta close this up here.
Um, thank you guys for, for listening.

641
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:00,540
I can't say this word for my daughter.
You know what I say?

642
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:05,100
You so and so's have a great weekend.
I'll talk to you guys.

643
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:11,640
Go F yourself. Go F yourself.
Don't take any s from anybody. Um,

644
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:15,720
I'll talk to you guys on Monday and,
uh, congratulations to Clode. Julian,

645
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,780
forgetting the respect you deserved.
You were unemployed for what?

646
00:39:18,781 --> 00:39:23,220
Two or three days? Uh, best of luck to
you even though you with the Canadians,

647
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,350
unless you play in my thoughts.
All right, I'll see you

648
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,820
foil the Chet cats

649
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,020
walking
it.

650
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,860
Don't vote a drip. The Suva, Chris,

651
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:51,040
we'll start out through the
[inaudible].

652
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:06,403
[inaudible].

653
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,080
Hey, what's going on? It is

654
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:12,290
edit is the Monday morning
podcast for Monday,

655
00:40:12,291 --> 00:40:16,370
February 16th,

656
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:20,090
2009 in the year of the fucking,
what is it?

657
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:23,870
What is it the year of
in China?

658
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:27,010
What animal is it?
Do you ever,

659
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:30,110
that's one of those dumb conversations
you have in a bar when they'll have like

660
00:40:30,111 --> 00:40:34,100
a poster of land on the wall.
Like what year were you born in?

661
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:39,140
You were born the year of the monkey.
I can see that. I can see that.

662
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:43,670
No, totally. I can see that.
Shut up. You're dumb cunt.

663
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:49,040
Okay. You don't have anything to say.
It's okay to just not say anything.

664
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,030
You don't have to just start looking at
shit on the walls and trying to force a

665
00:40:53,031 --> 00:40:53,864
conversation.

666
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:58,220
Why don't you just stare straight ahead
and think about how you ended up here.

667
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:03,730
You know how you can change things
in the future so you won't have this

668
00:41:03,981 --> 00:41:08,981
screaming sound of fucking regret in
your head all the time to the point that

669
00:41:09,441 --> 00:41:13,790
you're going to need to try to drown it
out with some stupid fucking shit about

670
00:41:13,791 --> 00:41:18,290
a poster on the wall in this shithole bar.
Oh God.

671
00:41:18,291 --> 00:41:21,950
That felt good. Um, it's raining
out here right now in California.

672
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:27,520
Rainy days and Mondays always get me out.

673
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:32,300
I fucking hated that song. Who Sang
that song? That was the carpenters.

674
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:38,060
You know there's a woman to let shit
get to her, Huh? Oh, it's raining out.

675
00:41:38,061 --> 00:41:42,410
I think I'll go throw up my breakfast.
That's your fucking, that was,

676
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:46,540
that was really, really fucking
mean. That was really mean.

677
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:49,460
I apologize to the Karen
carpenters state for that one.

678
00:41:49,461 --> 00:41:54,290
I'm gonna make a donation to a,
the bulemia fund. You know what?

679
00:41:54,291 --> 00:41:56,510
Someone's going to take that joke really
seriously and I'm going to get some

680
00:41:56,511 --> 00:41:59,150
more fucking hate mail,
which I get on these things quite a bit,

681
00:41:59,151 --> 00:42:00,590
sometimes quite a bit.

682
00:42:00,591 --> 00:42:04,250
Sometimes you like that I say quite a
bit and I'm thinking in my head, no,

683
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:08,000
I really don't quite a bit. It's actually
sometimes, so I try to fix the lie,

684
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:12,560
but anyway, someone's going to fucking,
uh, not even a lie. It was just like,

685
00:42:12,561 --> 00:42:16,220
I was just exaggerating cause you know,
it's just what you do.

686
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,010
You know what I mean?
Like he just exaggerate.

687
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:21,140
You just get used to exaggerating
whatever the fuck it is you do.

688
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:23,330
You know what I'm doing right
now and doing the exact thing.

689
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:28,540
I just was given that hypothetical woman
who was talking about the poster in the

690
00:42:28,551 --> 00:42:31,550
bar. I was giving her shit about doing
it and then I turned around and I did it,

691
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:34,310
you know,
so now someone else has to have a podcast,

692
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:39,590
trash and me and that's how it starts.
Did that make sense? I didn't think so.

693
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:44,300
Um, yeah. So if you guys, if you've
never been out here to California,

694
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,420
at least the southern part of
it, uh, people always, you know,

695
00:42:47,421 --> 00:42:52,160
they talk about the weather out here, how
it's like groundhog day, how you know,

696
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:56,740
every day is the exact same. Only
good if he did 70 and beautiful loads,

697
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:59,630
you get sick of it.
And I used to be that person,

698
00:42:59,631 --> 00:43:03,200
but I kind of am starting to understand
the weather out here and it's pretty

699
00:43:03,201 --> 00:43:04,310
fucking fascinating.

700
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:08,270
Basically what happens is at
the beginning of the year,

701
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:11,870
usually I guess this time of
year, around January, February,

702
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:15,440
it rains almost every day for a month.

703
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,770
Almost every fucking day it rains.

704
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:24,200
And what it does is obviously
it builds up. Oh Jesus.

705
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:25,820
I've really talked myself
into a corner here.

706
00:43:25,821 --> 00:43:27,470
I really don't know what
the fuck I'm talking about,

707
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:29,600
but it's not going to stop me from
plowing through this. I was like,

708
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,990
it builds up the shrubs and green things.

709
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:35,120
Like I didn't even know what
fucking word to use there.

710
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:37,680
Just basically a Hollywood hills, you
know, they usually like, you know,

711
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:42,290
Brown and that type of shit because
we live in a desert. But, uh,

712
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:43,460
after a month of this stuff,

713
00:43:43,461 --> 00:43:48,461
everything becomes really green
and really beautiful and uh,

714
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:49,341
you know,

715
00:43:49,341 --> 00:43:52,850
then it stops raining and then it's 70
degrees out and everything's green and

716
00:43:52,851 --> 00:43:56,660
it's fucking gorgeous out here.
But what happens is over the,

717
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:01,550
over the course of the year,
because we live in a desert, uh,

718
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:05,210
all that Green Shit starts to turn
Brown and it starts drying out.

719
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:08,690
And then when the Santa
Ana winds come across,

720
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:11,690
it drives the shit out of it.
And then that's around fall.

721
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:15,830
And that's when we have fires out here.
And the funny thing is,

722
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:20,660
is the fires are completely natural.
People out of here for some reason,

723
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:24,790
they act like they're fucked
up. Like, oh my God, the fire.

724
00:44:24,791 --> 00:44:29,450
I just jumped over the flow of Holy Shit,
let's get to have,

725
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:33,300
and we sit there and we try to put the
fire out, which we shouldn't be doing.

726
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:37,080
Nature is taken it's fucking course.

727
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,650
It's burning out all that green shit.
And what the firemen dude is,

728
00:44:40,651 --> 00:44:44,850
they put the fucking fires out and
they leave a bunch of brown shit.

729
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:48,510
You know,
that should have burned up but now isn't.

730
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:50,850
And then next year the fire's
going to be even worse than,

731
00:44:50,851 --> 00:44:52,260
it's just the typical shit.

732
00:44:52,261 --> 00:44:56,730
Like we think it's a tragedy because
nature is doing what it naturally does.

733
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:59,280
And it's not nature's fault.

734
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:04,310
Some fucking idiot built a house in the
middle of Shit that turns brown every

735
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:10,530
year and catches on fire. You
know what I mean? Would you know,

736
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:14,160
would you sit in a fireplace? Would
you build a house in a giant fireplace?

737
00:45:14,161 --> 00:45:14,994
I wouldn't do that.

738
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:20,400
So what I'm trying to say is the fucking
living in the hills is overrated.

739
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:25,190
Do you want to live down here in the
flat lands while the apartment buildings

740
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:27,030
and well,
one palm tree catches on fire.

741
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:31,380
I mean the amount of people jogging by
with water bottles can put that shit up

742
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:35,880
with those fucking people who
live up in the hills. The crazy,

743
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:41,250
not to mention all the fucking desal
dries out because there's so little water,

744
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,010
right?
Because we live in a desert,

745
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:49,820
the soil dries out to like literally
like the top six inches is like fucking

746
00:45:50,041 --> 00:45:52,530
bone dry.
So then when it rains like this,

747
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:56,880
that's what causes your mud slide
because evidently it can't absorb it.

748
00:45:56,970 --> 00:46:01,970
It's like Dandruff and it just washes
down and it goes into the side of the

749
00:46:02,581 --> 00:46:07,200
guy's house. And I watch it
on the news and I laugh. Um,

750
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:10,670
what the fuck? What the fuck am I talking
about? Why do I read some stories?

751
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:11,970
I've got, you know, some,
I gotta tell you something.

752
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:15,030
I got some great questions this week.

753
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:18,510
I got some great stories and
some great underrated overrated.

754
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:23,280
I really feel like my 14 listeners,
which I think is actually up to 22.

755
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:24,210
I don't know what the fuck it is.

756
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:29,520
I just like say in 14 you guys are
really upping your game here. And um,

757
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,170
Oh,
before we get into the stories,

758
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:35,820
everyone who submitted me who made
the finals for that DVD competition,

759
00:46:35,821 --> 00:46:39,150
could you please resend me your addresses?
Half of you haven't.

760
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:42,840
Two of you sent me your addresses and
I lost the emails because I'm a fucking

761
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:45,240
moron. But um, I don't want to get,

762
00:46:45,241 --> 00:46:46,840
I don't want to get charged
with some sort of a,

763
00:46:46,841 --> 00:46:49,020
I don't want to be on like the news,
you know,

764
00:46:49,021 --> 00:46:52,440
those investigative reporting things.
You had a podcast.

765
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:56,790
It was only doing okay,
so they decided to give away some DVDs,

766
00:46:56,791 --> 00:47:00,720
but the DVDs never came.
Um,

767
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:04,500
I wanna I want to send them out. So
for the love of God. All right, Bill,

768
00:47:04,501 --> 00:47:06,330
why don't you shut the fuck
up and read the story? Okay.

769
00:47:06,331 --> 00:47:10,920
Here's a great story for
you. Um, you know, I do my
whole little rants about the,

770
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:15,720
uh, the automated checkout
lines in, uh, in grocery stores.

771
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:18,090
And how [inaudible] they're bullshit.

772
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:21,100
I don't think it's technological
advancement. It's technical,

773
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:26,490
technological advancement will be if I
just walked up and somehow I just stood

774
00:47:26,491 --> 00:47:31,491
there and magically this machine knew
what fuck I owed and then I paid and then

775
00:47:31,931 --> 00:47:34,420
I left.
That would be an advancement.

776
00:47:34,421 --> 00:47:38,140
But to come up with an automated
machine where now I go up,

777
00:47:38,141 --> 00:47:42,580
there is no cashier and then I become
the cashier to me is not technological

778
00:47:42,581 --> 00:47:45,490
advancements. That's me working
at the grocery store for free.

779
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:50,320
So one of my disciples who actually
believed in this said, hey bill,

780
00:47:50,321 --> 00:47:52,930
here's something that happened to you
yesterday. You might appreciate. He said,

781
00:47:52,931 --> 00:47:54,940
I was in a stop and shop yesterday.

782
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:59,620
So I'm guessing that's east coast right
though. Let's go to the stop and shop,

783
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:03,250
get a fucking 30 pack.
This throws dude,

784
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:07,510
I was in stop and shop yesterday and
just grabbing a couple of things.

785
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:12,280
There was one lane open and the four
empty self check, uh, registers.

786
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:17,170
So basically one lane's open with the
cashier and then there's four of those

787
00:48:17,171 --> 00:48:19,600
automated things that
are wide open. And, uh,

788
00:48:19,601 --> 00:48:23,740
so he says [inaudible] remembering the
point you made in the podcast a few weeks

789
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:28,330
ago about the whole self check concept.
I got back into the open line,

790
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:32,800
um, behind five or six people,
I guess that's the cashier line.

791
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:37,320
The girl who stays by the self check
lanes came over and said she noticed that

792
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:42,070
only had a few things and that I could
you just use the self checker and be out

793
00:48:42,071 --> 00:48:45,280
of there quicker. I just
said, no, that's okay.

794
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:47,590
I'm not going to do your
people's job for you.

795
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:54,250
After she heard that, she was like,
excuse me. So it was like nothing.

796
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:57,940
I have no problem waiting.
I'm just not doing your job for you.

797
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:03,610
So she walks away and about a minute or
two later a manager comes over to me and

798
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:04,780
ask if there's a problem.

799
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,100
So I keep my composure at this point
and tell him there's no problem.

800
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:13,480
Then I just rather wait online
than ring up my own stuff.

801
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:18,100
He then goes on to tell me
that his employee told him
that I was being rude and

802
00:49:18,101 --> 00:49:22,840
disrespectful and that he was going to
ask me to leave the store. I said to him,

803
00:49:22,841 --> 00:49:24,580
are you serious?
I didn't even raise my voice.

804
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:28,450
I just told her I'd rather wait in
line and that the other people online

805
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:30,640
standing next to me can vouch for me.

806
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:34,090
Of course when he asked the
other people what happened,

807
00:49:34,091 --> 00:49:38,350
nobody said a Goddamn word to defend me
because I was apparently in aligned with

808
00:49:38,351 --> 00:49:42,160
a group of Helen Keller's typical
spineless fucking pussies. Right.

809
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:44,980
So this is his final point.
He says,

810
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:48,430
I understand that the girl was just trying
to help me out by suggesting that I,

811
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:51,070
I use that line to get
out of the store quicker.

812
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:53,920
But when I calmly told
her that I was fine,

813
00:49:53,921 --> 00:49:57,040
she didn't have to make up some
bullshit story to spite me.

814
00:49:58,030 --> 00:49:58,960
When the day comes,

815
00:49:58,961 --> 00:50:03,961
when cashiers are phased out and all
there is is self check registers and that

816
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:07,930
content is out of a job,
I will have a nice chuckle to myself.

817
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:11,650
You know something Mike,
I can't get mad a on that one.

818
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:13,540
I actually got annoyed

819
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:18,940
by that girl and if she lost a
job, but you know, I don't know.

820
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:24,790
I think you're right on that one.
Although I got to admit, you know, you,

821
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:30,420
you know to use the narrows
line in Goodfellas, you a yeah,

822
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:33,680
you insulted a little bit, a little
bit. He kind of insulted her.

823
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:37,700
You've got to go nicer next time and
just say, listen. You know what I mean?

824
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:40,760
I don't want you to lose your job.
Those two of those machines,

825
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:43,670
I'd taken your job and I don't
want to be a part of that.

826
00:50:43,671 --> 00:50:47,510
So I'd rather stand in line here so you
guys can keep making a paycheck if you

827
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:50,000
set it that way.
But you kind of went a little bit,

828
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,970
a little bit when a little
hostile and you will like, yeah,

829
00:50:52,971 --> 00:50:57,290
I'm not doing your job for you. You
know? I mean, I don't know. Did you have,

830
00:50:57,291 --> 00:51:00,950
you know, so go fuck yourself tone. I
have no idea. But you know something.

831
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:04,730
I totally back you when you think that,
you know.

832
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:09,380
Well I would, I would have
been living in that situation.

833
00:51:09,381 --> 00:51:13,010
I wouldn't have been able to control
myself when that manager came over,

834
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:17,330
I would've been like, I
didn't say anything and I
would swim in like, you know,

835
00:51:17,331 --> 00:51:20,030
these machines are bullshit. At that
point I would occur. So they'd be like,

836
00:51:20,031 --> 00:51:23,930
I'm sorry, so you need to, you
need to leave the store. So, um,

837
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:28,460
I don't know that make any sense. It's
like, I agree with you and I scolded you.

838
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:31,640
I agree with you. When she doesn't
have a job, I'll be fucking happy too.

839
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:34,820
And you know,
I dunno.

840
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:39,650
I don't know what the, well that's,
that's, that's a, that's a rough one.

841
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:42,650
That is rough one.
I'm just fucking out of it today.

842
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:46,370
I had a real fucking bad time
last night of comedy clubs. I,

843
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:50,660
two different people coming up to
me saying shit like, uh, you know,

844
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,190
I'm not even going to fucking say it.

845
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:55,790
It's just one of those things where
another comic comes up to you and as they

846
00:51:55,791 --> 00:51:59,000
compliment you on a joke, you know that
they're going to steal it. You know,

847
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:02,590
they do that shit, you know, you know,

848
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:06,550
I really liked that joke you did about
the blah blah blah blah blah. You know,

849
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,270
it's just amazing.
You know when I watch comics,

850
00:52:08,271 --> 00:52:10,700
all the different takes
people have on things.

851
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:17,090
Now let me guess. Your take is the same
as my take, except you switched to words.

852
00:52:17,091 --> 00:52:22,090
You fucking Cock sucker. I'm all
right. Next story. Hey Bow. Uh,

853
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,200
thanks for driving that faggy hybrid.

854
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,500
He says always nice to read
on a fucking Monday. Hey Bill,

855
00:52:27,501 --> 00:52:32,501
thanks for driving that faggy hybrid
every bit you guys save ensures that that

856
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:38,420
ensures just that much more
for me to use in my muscle car.

857
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:42,680
Was wondering if you've got something
that looks like a car or did you get the

858
00:52:42,681 --> 00:52:46,760
one shaped like a butt plug?
All kidding aside.

859
00:52:46,761 --> 00:52:51,410
I dig you stand up podcast, all
that shit. Awesome. Um, no hybrid.

860
00:52:51,411 --> 00:52:55,220
Looks like a buck plug. I [inaudible] I
didn't know what a buck plug looks like.

861
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:57,650
I imagined it looks like something
that you stick in the sink.

862
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:00,350
And then when a butt plug looks like,

863
00:53:04,310 --> 00:53:07,310
I'm like, oh, he's calling me a fag. But
he knows what a butt plug looks like.

864
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:11,390
You know something? I'm going to chime
in early on. The underrated overrated.

865
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:13,430
You know what's overrated?
Muscle cars.

866
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:17,510
Muscle cars are so fucking overrated.
It's ridiculous.

867
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,400
If you've seen those things,
those auctions,

868
00:53:19,401 --> 00:53:24,401
they have these fucking baby boomer Geek
fucking rich douche bags are spending

869
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:29,130
like 150 grand to get a 68 Mustang.

870
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:31,110
The fuck is wrong with you.

871
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:35,130
Fucking idiots probably
can't even change the oil.

872
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,540
They want to go in there and get the,
you know,

873
00:53:36,541 --> 00:53:41,541
the body off restoration playing 150
fucking thousand dollars for a Mustang,

874
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:46,530
the Mustang. You know what
I mean? If fucking idiot,

875
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:51,210
you could literally go buy a
piece of Shit Mustang, you know,

876
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:51,931
not piece of shit,

877
00:53:51,931 --> 00:53:54,450
but it's got a decent body and just
throw new fucking engine in it.

878
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,030
Why would you spend 150 grand?
What is that?

879
00:53:57,090 --> 00:54:01,770
It's got the original well roll
the window down handles. You know,

880
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:06,750
in 1968 these were actually shut up.
It's not worth 150 grand.

881
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:11,160
Those cars are so fucking grossly
overpriced. Those are overpriced.

882
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:14,250
Those vintage guitars. I
don't, there's any musicians,

883
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:19,910
those fucking beat up fucking fenders and
Les Pauls from 40 50 years ago that I,

884
00:54:20,911 --> 00:54:25,340
you know, can't play. You can't
fucking play. There's no reason.

885
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:28,440
There's no guitar that's worth
50 fucking thousand dollars.

886
00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:31,620
And they got the shit kicked out of them.
They're all worn out.

887
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:36,120
They look like shit. I don't understand
it. So we bought the point the other day.

888
00:54:36,121 --> 00:54:38,750
Well let's Stevie Ray Vaughn,
he used to play an old guitar.

889
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:40,140
He got an a pawn shop.

890
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:43,890
He probably paid fucking 30
bucks for it can tell you right.

891
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:45,150
Not that thing was 50 grand.

892
00:54:45,151 --> 00:54:49,230
He would've been playing a Ukulele
on the Texas flood album. Um,

893
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:53,910
but anyways, I, why did people think they
are so manly? If they have a muscle car,

894
00:54:53,911 --> 00:54:57,540
I don't fucking understand it.
It's like you can get one for 15 grand.

895
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:03,540
Sounded like I couldn't afford to buy one.
I just fucking idiot.

896
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:06,660
And it just automatically makes you gay.
I gotta admit it's a little tires,

897
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:10,170
this little tires or make it faggy
and you know what? The guys, right?

898
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:13,650
They are faggy they all saggy. Look, I
don't know if they look like blood plugs,

899
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:16,770
you know? Sorry. You know what?

900
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:23,150
At the risk of having the FBI come to
my door to find out what I'm doing,

901
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:26,520
I'm actually going to go on the Internet
right now and I'm going to fucking

902
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:29,520
Google images but plugs,

903
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:34,020
you know what I picture I picture like I
literally picture like a little plug in

904
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:36,720
and it has like the threads.
Like you'd literally screw it in

905
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:42,420
and then it's got that little metal ring.
He just,

906
00:55:42,490 --> 00:55:45,870
because he does sort of pull it out.
All right is,

907
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,480
but with two butt plug,

908
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:53,430
I'm going to have to fucking burn this
fucking iPod after I do this images.

909
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:59,160
All right bud. Plug search images
for a buck plug. Here we go.

910
00:55:59,161 --> 00:56:02,100
Jesus Christ.
That looks like a fucking grenade.

911
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:08,490
Customed buck.
There's a Paris Hilton but plug and it's,

912
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:12,660
it's shaped like a hand.
Oh my God.

913
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:15,210
He's a horrific Fox tail buck plug.

914
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:21,810
Cause a family circus with a butler.
Wow.

915
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:25,150
These are creepy sex toys.
A creepy.

916
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:29,860
Okay. These are gross.
Um, in to save you guys.

917
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:36,280
Well, I can't explain what they
look like. I guess they look like

918
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:44,320
they look like Christmas
trees with the stand.

919
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:49,480
That's the only way I can describe
it. It's the same shape. That's grubs.

920
00:56:50,590 --> 00:56:52,630
That's fucking gross seed.
See what to see the level.

921
00:56:52,631 --> 00:56:57,580
You just fucking brought this podcast
down too. That was really disgusting. Um,

922
00:56:57,910 --> 00:57:01,090
anyways, we know something. The audio
of this will save me if the FBI comes.

923
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:06,730
I'm like p towns and I was
just the one research. Um,
all right, next one. Hey Bill,

924
00:57:06,731 --> 00:57:07,570
I saw you on,
uh,

925
00:57:07,571 --> 00:57:10,960
on comedy central and December and
I'd been listening to you ever since.

926
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:14,470
I know how strongly you feel about people.

927
00:57:14,471 --> 00:57:18,100
What the fuck is this
using the self checkout,

928
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:22,210
which I agree with and I was wondering
how you feel about people paying bills

929
00:57:22,211 --> 00:57:25,360
online. This is a great
question. How do you,

930
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:30,370
what do you feel about people paying bills
online? Um, I'll tell you what I feel.

931
00:57:30,371 --> 00:57:35,290
I think you're out of your fucking
mind. If you pay your bills online. Um,

932
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:39,610
I know it's easier and it's
more convenient, but uh,

933
00:57:40,970 --> 00:57:43,660
you know that bullshit where they
sit there and they try to say like,

934
00:57:43,661 --> 00:57:47,320
this is a completely secure site.
You don't have to worry,

935
00:57:47,321 --> 00:57:51,610
but that this fucking nerds out there
breaking into the fucking computer at the

936
00:57:51,611 --> 00:57:54,760
Pentagon, you sh he should
never pay your bills online.

937
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:58,240
He shouldn't buy anything online.
You shouldn't do any of that.

938
00:57:58,241 --> 00:58:02,620
You're rolling the dice. Cause I'm not
gonna lie to you. I do it. I do it.

939
00:58:02,621 --> 00:58:06,160
But every time it's fucking stupid.
I, I, I won't pay my bills online.

940
00:58:06,161 --> 00:58:10,180
I certainly won't do that. Online
banking, you're going to put your fucking,

941
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:14,170
your be a balance. You fucking, uh,

942
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:17,680
account number,
all of that shit.

943
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:20,680
You're going to put that online yet
you're outta your writing, your mind,

944
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:24,700
you out of your mind. But this
guy is basically saying, ah,

945
00:58:24,701 --> 00:58:27,940
I'm probably beating a dead horse, but
the less mail that needs to be delivered,

946
00:58:27,941 --> 00:58:29,470
the less carriers they need.

947
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:33,850
My brother is a mail carrier
and it fucking pisses me
off that people don't want

948
00:58:33,851 --> 00:58:37,750
to pay 42 cents to mail a letter. I
mean, come on, I'm a tight ass myself,

949
00:58:37,751 --> 00:58:42,610
but you can't, you can't buy shit
with 42 cents. What do you think? Um,

950
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:47,260
I dunno man, email, email
people back and forth. I mean,

951
00:58:47,261 --> 00:58:51,370
there is an element of technology to
it, but I will tell you this, like,

952
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:55,930
I will forever pay bills by you using,
uh,

953
00:58:56,530 --> 00:59:00,130
the male. I'm a male man. I just,
I dunno. It just seems, I mean,

954
00:59:00,131 --> 00:59:04,210
not saying that people can't
fuck with you mail, but I dunno.

955
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:07,030
I think you're out of your
fucking mind if at the very least,

956
00:59:07,031 --> 00:59:09,610
if you do your banking online,
you're out of your fucking mind.

957
00:59:10,030 --> 00:59:12,670
Unless you don't have shit anyways, so you
don't have any money. Who gives a fuck?

958
00:59:12,671 --> 00:59:16,300
Right. That's one of the great
things about being broke. You know,

959
00:59:16,330 --> 00:59:18,160
when you want to punch
someone in the face, she can,

960
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,500
you don't have to worry
about getting sued by,

961
00:59:20,501 --> 00:59:23,030
I guess you've gotta worry going to
jail and you can't afford a good lawyer.

962
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:26,480
I don't know what the fuck I'm
talking about. Um, anyways,

963
00:59:26,481 --> 00:59:28,550
let's talk about shit I have coming up.
Um,

964
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:34,220
I'm going to be at a wiseguy comedy club,
uh,

965
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:38,720
this weekend in Ogden,
Utah. And this is my, uh,

966
00:59:39,090 --> 00:59:41,390
the first time I've ever been out.
I did a college,

967
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:44,240
there are a number of years ago.
Uh,

968
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:47,540
but I can't remember the last time I
was out when the fuck was I on Utah.

969
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:52,370
I don't remember. But anyways, it's,
the show was on a February 20th.

970
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:57,920
And the website is
www.wiseguyscomedy.com.

971
00:59:58,070 --> 01:00:00,800
If you're on my website,
you can click on the link.

972
01:00:01,370 --> 01:00:06,320
It's right to the left hand side of
the page and clicked on Ogden. Uh,

973
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:09,980
I'm going to be there for one
night, one night, only two shows.

974
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:14,720
And uh, and that's it. Wait a second.

975
01:00:14,721 --> 01:00:17,000
What the fuck are they saying here on
the website? Oh, they got it right.

976
01:00:17,001 --> 01:00:18,860
They got it right.
So there you go.

977
01:00:18,861 --> 01:00:23,270
So if you saw many comedy central wrote
a whole new fucking hour and a, yeah.

978
01:00:23,330 --> 01:00:26,030
So while you Mormons,
whatever the hell you guys are out there,

979
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:31,670
you Byu fans, come on out to the
show and I'll make you fucking laugh.

980
01:00:31,671 --> 01:00:35,450
And then I'll go back to my hotel room
and stare out the window wondering what

981
01:00:35,451 --> 01:00:40,040
happened. It's actually a scary place
to land, if I remember correctly.

982
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:43,850
Salt Lake City is surrounded by mountains,
so they kind of have to fly over them.

983
01:00:43,851 --> 01:00:47,000
And then at the last second
do like a military landing,

984
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:51,290
just dropped like 10,000 feet,
I believe.

985
01:00:52,610 --> 01:00:55,490
Um, Alrighty. Here we go. Let's get into
the podcast. Questions for the week,

986
01:00:55,491 --> 01:00:59,990
for the week. All Right, Bill, question
number one. Uh, every now and then,

987
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:05,180
every now and again on shows like access
Hollywood entertainment tonight or x or

988
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:06,073
extra,

989
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:11,770
they let the everyday working class
person know how much television and movie

990
01:01:12,411 --> 01:01:16,190
stars make.
Every time I hear the ungodly amounts,

991
01:01:16,191 --> 01:01:20,120
I'm disgusted as well.
I should be. Alrighty.

992
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:24,260
Fully understanding the gluttony
involving the government and the banks.

993
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:29,360
Uh, what about these repulsive
repulsively overpaid stars?

994
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:31,341
Um,
I don't,

995
01:01:31,341 --> 01:01:36,341
why are you comparing celebrities to a
banks that stole from everybody's 401k?

996
01:01:38,790 --> 01:01:42,050
You know, what's the worst to star
can do? Put out a movie high bid.

997
01:01:42,050 --> 01:01:46,450
Say It's good and you're out 10 bucks.
You know what I mean? And they usually,

998
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:51,320
most of them fall off after
three years. And, um, I dunno,

999
01:01:51,590 --> 01:01:53,150
I don't think they're grossly overpaid.

1000
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:56,360
I think they are overpaid because the
actors underneath them don't make as much

1001
01:01:56,361 --> 01:02:00,410
as they used to. And the main
person, I guess gets most
of the money. But, you know,

1002
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:05,990
look, you fucking make a movie
and you have me star in it,

1003
01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:09,170
or you have Tom Cruise star in it.
You know what I mean? You can't say,

1004
01:02:09,171 --> 01:02:13,430
Tom Cruise isn't worth the fucking money.
You put Tom Cruise in it.

1005
01:02:13,431 --> 01:02:17,610
It's guaranteed the fucking things
going to make $100 million. Basically.

1006
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:22,230
He's been doing that for 25 years. I don't
think that that guy's overpaid. So, uh,

1007
01:02:22,330 --> 01:02:25,260
and I, I don't, I don't agree with that.
I don't think that you could, you know,

1008
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:29,940
government stealing money
and bank stealing money. You
can say that. Celebrities,

1009
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:33,840
uh, I dunno. I don't think
that's the same thing.

1010
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:38,700
Not to mention celebrities have no
privacy. What's so fucking ever and uh,

1011
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:42,930
I think they get paid right about what
they deserve because when you get to that

1012
01:02:42,931 --> 01:02:45,810
level of fame, you need a huge
house with a wall around it.

1013
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:47,700
You need your own movie theater,

1014
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:51,540
you need your own tennis courts cause
you can't fucking go anywhere. You know,

1015
01:02:51,541 --> 01:02:55,110
because eventually you're going to have
to pick your nose and it's going to be

1016
01:02:55,111 --> 01:02:58,050
on the cover of a magazine.
So you need, you know,

1017
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:02,910
200 foot shrubs so you can comfortably
get the underwear out of your ass and do

1018
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:07,740
what fucking human beings do.
Does that make any sense?

1019
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:10,830
All right bill.
I watched a lot of standup comedy.

1020
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:15,840
I critique it to death. I analyzed
the joke delivery, wording,

1021
01:03:15,841 --> 01:03:17,310
timing,
everything does the size.

1022
01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:19,860
What could've been done differently
to make it funnier when I watched you

1023
01:03:19,861 --> 01:03:22,260
perform a,

1024
01:03:22,261 --> 01:03:26,160
everything you do and say seems to be
spot on and it went perfectly planned.

1025
01:03:26,161 --> 01:03:28,050
I was wondering,
when you watch your own specials,

1026
01:03:28,051 --> 01:03:32,130
do you find parts that you are unhappy
with or feel you could have done much

1027
01:03:32,131 --> 01:03:35,960
better or differently? Yeah, the
whole fucking thing. I won't when I,

1028
01:03:35,970 --> 01:03:36,870
when I go to edit it,

1029
01:03:36,871 --> 01:03:41,850
I watch it one time I watched it
one time with one eye closed and,

1030
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:46,740
uh, and then I never watch it again.
I'm going to be one of those people,

1031
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:51,270
like if I ever get my own TV show,
I will never watch one episode of it.

1032
01:03:55,170 --> 01:03:56,003
Yeah.

1033
01:03:56,130 --> 01:04:00,930
It's not a fucking natural thing to see
the back of your head or see what the

1034
01:04:00,931 --> 01:04:05,100
side of your face looks like or to
hear what your voice sounds like. Oh.

1035
01:04:05,101 --> 01:04:06,600
To watch you hold in a glass.

1036
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:11,550
It's not natural to be outside of yourself
watching yourself. It's just fucking,

1037
01:04:11,551 --> 01:04:15,720
you know, you're having, it's like
this outer body experience. It's just,

1038
01:04:15,721 --> 01:04:20,680
it's fucking weird. And uh, I dunno if
you're comfortable doing it. I don't,

1039
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:24,900
I think that's, I don't know more power
to you, but I can't fucking do it.

1040
01:04:25,290 --> 01:04:30,180
So yeah, I always think of, I think
about stuff all the time. Well, my, uh,

1041
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:34,310
you know, certain times
my Hbo Special Man, I, I,

1042
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:38,850
that one was a number one wasn't too hard
to watch because that one went great.

1043
01:04:38,851 --> 01:04:42,180
Why do I do this? Wasn't too
hard to watch, but those, I
only watched him one time,

1044
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:47,750
but like a, a bunch of shit
earlier on earlier on in my career.

1045
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:50,640
You know what it is, it's when it's
on TV, that's when it freaks me out.

1046
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:53,930
Like if I fill my sense self last night,
you know,

1047
01:04:54,030 --> 01:04:55,470
at the comedy store or whatever,

1048
01:04:55,650 --> 01:04:58,590
I could go home and I could watch it and
I wouldn't have a problem watching it

1049
01:04:58,591 --> 01:04:59,760
and I could actually enjoy it.

1050
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:05,300
But the second I know it's going to be
on TV and a as a fucking cell phone,

1051
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:11,010
my girlfriend's cellphone,
California dreaming Hump Gaze us fly.

1052
01:05:12,070 --> 01:05:16,680
Hey, it's your phone. Um, anyway,

1053
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:22,150
um, what was I gonna say? Yeah, so, but
the second I know it's going to be on TV,

1054
01:05:22,151 --> 01:05:24,640
that's when it freaks me out. And
then I'm like, oh my God, you know,

1055
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:30,600
anywhere from fucking a thousand
people to fucking whatever.

1056
01:05:31,930 --> 01:05:34,600
How many people fucking watch comedy
central, however many of that is,

1057
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:38,350
are going to see this shit.
And then everything I do,

1058
01:05:38,530 --> 01:05:42,160
any little screw up that I do becomes,
you know,

1059
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:47,020
900 feet tall and I freaked the fuck
out and probably comes down to the fact

1060
01:05:47,021 --> 01:05:51,430
that I don't like myself. Aw, that's
sad though. Why don't you like yourself?

1061
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:55,480
Um, I don't know. Working
on it. All right, Bill,

1062
01:05:56,740 --> 01:05:57,690
what would you attempt it?

1063
01:05:57,691 --> 01:05:59,950
This is the person that asked me
a bunch of new agey questions.

1064
01:05:59,951 --> 01:06:04,840
What would you attempt to do if
you knew you would not fail? Uh,

1065
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:09,850
jump off a tall building. You know, I
guess I would've failed by jumping up,

1066
01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:13,510
jumping off a building and living,
you know,

1067
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:15,900
I just want to feel that that
adrenaline adrenaline rush feels like,

1068
01:06:16,030 --> 01:06:20,110
cause you're like, ah, kids, you're
going down. I do something like that.

1069
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:24,220
Um, I know that person wanted something
a lot deeper than that. Let me see here.

1070
01:06:24,221 --> 01:06:27,100
What would you, what would you attempt
to do if you knew you wouldn't fail?

1071
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:31,300
Uh, what would I do? Ah,

1072
01:06:33,970 --> 01:06:37,510
Jesus Christ. I'd probably try
to do some Gandy Shit, you know,

1073
01:06:38,350 --> 01:06:42,670
if I wouldn't get assassinated,
I wish I had that kind of charisma.

1074
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:48,300
If I could lead a Gandy revolt against
these fucking automated cashier machines,

1075
01:06:49,151 --> 01:06:54,040
you know, I shoot small, you know
what I mean? Gandhi. You know,

1076
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:58,090
what did he get? He got England to fucking
leave India. What things does he get?

1077
01:06:58,091 --> 01:07:01,150
He gets shot in the back of the fucking
head. Or at least Ben Kingsley did.

1078
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:04,510
I never, I don't know much
about the real Gundy. Actually.

1079
01:07:04,511 --> 01:07:08,860
You know what's funny when
I pictured Gandhi, a picture
Ben Kingsley as Gandy. Um,

1080
01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:12,550
number two, Bill, you had two
identities. If you had two identities,

1081
01:07:12,551 --> 01:07:16,660
one is yourself and one is an animal. What
kind of animal would you be? You know,

1082
01:07:16,661 --> 01:07:20,470
something. I feel like I'm in a
really bad date right now. Uh,

1083
01:07:20,650 --> 01:07:21,880
what kind of animal would I be?

1084
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:26,290
Something that could run the fuck away
really fast from these questions? Um,

1085
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:30,340
if I could be one animal,
I think it'd be a bird.

1086
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:31,860
Cause I've always thought how to fly.

1087
01:07:36,310 --> 01:07:38,410
What kind of animal would I be?
Uh,

1088
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:43,570
something poisonous so I can fucking
bite you on your ankle. No, that's mean,

1089
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:49,000
I don't know. What's my favorite
animal? I like bears. So stupid.

1090
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:50,380
Question number three,
Bill,

1091
01:07:50,381 --> 01:07:55,381
what is one of the most valuable lessons
you have learned so far to proofread

1092
01:07:56,201 --> 01:07:59,830
the questions? Know what does the
mall, I'm really trashing this person.

1093
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:03,490
He's a good question. You know
what? Don't don't. Don't be if you,

1094
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:05,710
if you're the person who wrote this,
you listen to me right now.

1095
01:08:05,890 --> 01:08:08,740
Don't feel bad that you wrote these.
Okay, this has nothing to do with you.

1096
01:08:08,890 --> 01:08:10,120
This has to do with me,

1097
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:13,840
and all of a sudden you're tapping into
an emotional level in me that I'm not

1098
01:08:13,841 --> 01:08:16,520
comfortable exposing.
All right?

1099
01:08:16,521 --> 01:08:19,940
This is feeling like I have to relax
and open up and it's just really fucking

1100
01:08:19,941 --> 01:08:21,770
creeping me out.
All right,

1101
01:08:21,771 --> 01:08:24,470
let me fucking white knock on my
way through this last one. Bill,

1102
01:08:24,471 --> 01:08:27,860
what is one of the most valuable
lessons you have learned so far?

1103
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:29,181
Whether you learned it,

1104
01:08:29,181 --> 01:08:33,980
watching someone else go through the
situation or you expected at yourself,

1105
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:39,200
experienced it yourself. Uh Oh, uh, yeah.

1106
01:08:39,201 --> 01:08:41,480
I would say that life
doesn't have to be hard,

1107
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:46,910
that you don't have to be miserable and
that you don't have to be surrounded by

1108
01:08:46,911 --> 01:08:51,530
a bunch of cons and that a,
if that's how you grew up,

1109
01:08:52,790 --> 01:08:54,770
you know,
without even realizing it,

1110
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:59,510
you go out into the world and you
surround yourself with those same kinds of

1111
01:08:59,511 --> 01:09:03,890
people just because you're used to it.
And then maybe one day you get to,

1112
01:09:03,891 --> 01:09:06,470
what I figured out about a year
ago, it was like, hey, you know,

1113
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:10,370
I really don't have to hang out
with a bunch of assholes. You know?

1114
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:13,340
I think that's why so many
marriages don't work out.

1115
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:17,450
It's because you just want to get away
from your family and then you go out and

1116
01:09:17,451 --> 01:09:22,070
you end up marrying
the exact same kind of,

1117
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:26,000
uh, fuck. I was just having
this conversation last night
over a couple of bears.

1118
01:09:27,410 --> 01:09:31,400
You know, whatever misery you grew
up with, if you're not careful,

1119
01:09:31,401 --> 01:09:36,320
you go out and you marry it. You
know, expecting change. Don't, don't,

1120
01:09:36,490 --> 01:09:40,550
uh, I guess that's what I, I've, I've,
uh, I can't even say I learned it.

1121
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:44,180
I noticed it. I noticed that. I was
like, Hey, look at that shit over there.

1122
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:48,080
All right, good. That's, you
guys really want to freak me out.

1123
01:09:48,081 --> 01:09:51,790
Ask me some new agey questions and
that'll be a new section of the podcast.

1124
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:55,970
We get to watch me squirm and be fucking
uncomfortable. Probably up to right now.

1125
01:09:55,971 --> 01:09:59,120
29 minutes. All right. I'm gonna try to
keep these a little bit shorter here.

1126
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:02,840
All right. Hey, bill, have you
ever gotten revenge on a person,

1127
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:07,850
on an object or an object,
like a printer in office space?

1128
01:10:07,851 --> 01:10:11,900
That movie? Um, I gotta admit
I'm not a big revenge person.

1129
01:10:14,030 --> 01:10:18,470
Uh, I don't feel comfortable with it. I
always like that goes to a really dark,

1130
01:10:20,150 --> 01:10:23,330
dark place that's like a, you holding
the hand of the devil when you,

1131
01:10:23,331 --> 01:10:26,000
when you do some shit like that.
Like I walk away,

1132
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:30,980
if someone really fucks me over,
I just let them learn.

1133
01:10:30,981 --> 01:10:35,450
I walk away like, I've never,
uh, you know, you know,

1134
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:39,680
if I ever dated a girl and she fucked
me over something, I just always,

1135
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:44,210
I just said, fuck it. I walked away. It's
just not worth it. It's not worth it.

1136
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:48,410
I'm not doing it.
And I know me is not only,

1137
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:49,910
you know,

1138
01:10:49,910 --> 01:10:53,840
have I just gotten fucked over and now
I'm going to seek revenge and his odds

1139
01:10:53,841 --> 01:10:56,090
are that I'm going to get
caught seeking revenge.

1140
01:10:56,870 --> 01:11:00,640
And that's the worst because that's
like one time I had like I want to,

1141
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:02,330
first time I lived out here in La,

1142
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:07,470
I came back from being on the road for
two weeks and there was a, there was, uh,

1143
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:10,470
a note on my door saying that,

1144
01:11:10,580 --> 01:11:14,280
that they needed to check my
smoke alarms and that they will,

1145
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:16,380
they needed to check them
by this certain date.

1146
01:11:17,130 --> 01:11:21,030
And by the time I got off the road, the
date was literally like a week earlier,

1147
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:21,953
right?

1148
01:11:22,650 --> 01:11:27,630
So evidently they had the legal right
to go into my apartment because if there

1149
01:11:27,631 --> 01:11:30,590
was a, if my smoke detectors,
you know, our faulty, a fire,

1150
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:34,380
my apartment affects the other units.
That was their reasoning.

1151
01:11:34,650 --> 01:11:39,030
So I walked in there and I could just
immediately tell that someone who had been

1152
01:11:39,031 --> 01:11:42,450
in my apartment. And, uh,

1153
01:11:42,630 --> 01:11:45,270
there's one of these deals back in the
day when I really did the road for a long

1154
01:11:45,271 --> 01:11:49,020
time. Like when I came back, you know,
from the, I've been on the road so long,

1155
01:11:49,021 --> 01:11:52,140
like all the water and basically
evaporated out of my toilet,

1156
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:54,000
you know what I mean?
Those was like half an inch of water,

1157
01:11:54,001 --> 01:11:55,200
like that type of shit.
Right.

1158
01:11:56,460 --> 01:12:01,020
And I was sitting there and I sat
down, I was like, fucking eat.

1159
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:03,510
I don't know what it was.
Some sort of a say ESP,

1160
01:12:03,511 --> 01:12:07,680
I don't want the fucking proper term is,
but I could just feel it.

1161
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:11,250
I was like,
something's not right.

1162
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:16,230
And I got up and I looked through my
apartment and I was mentioned missing a

1163
01:12:16,231 --> 01:12:17,064
camera.

1164
01:12:17,310 --> 01:12:22,310
I was missing a watch and the person
had picked through my CD collections.

1165
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:27,690
Evidently they will a rap fan, cause
that's all they took. And uh, you know,

1166
01:12:27,691 --> 01:12:31,650
nickel and dime shit. So I went downstairs
to the management and I was like,

1167
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:34,920
you know,
I come back from being on the road.

1168
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:37,200
You say you're going to check my
smoke detectors and I walk in there,

1169
01:12:37,201 --> 01:12:39,870
I'm just gonna Watch Mrs CD's.
I missed some cameras.

1170
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:42,360
The place is still locked from the inside.

1171
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:45,390
And the guy immediately just
snapped on me, says, look,

1172
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:49,170
I don't appreciate you calling the were
accused and Booboo, booboo, booboo.

1173
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:52,350
And I'm like, I didn't accuse
anybody. I didn't accuse anybody.

1174
01:12:52,351 --> 01:12:57,240
I don't appreciate you standing here
getting upset with me. Like on this guy.

1175
01:12:57,241 --> 01:12:57,481
Just,

1176
01:12:57,481 --> 01:13:02,010
he totally tried to grill his way through
the shit and at one point he's just

1177
01:13:02,011 --> 01:13:04,440
like, whatever. He's like, I
have the power, I have the power.

1178
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:07,380
He literally said that and I wanted to
reach across and just rip this guy's

1179
01:13:07,381 --> 01:13:08,214
fucking throat out.

1180
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:14,230
So my girlfriend at the time goes, you
know who the guy is? I'm like, yeah.

1181
01:13:14,231 --> 01:13:16,470
She goes, you know where
his car is? Yeah. She goes,

1182
01:13:16,471 --> 01:13:20,040
you should go down and fuck up his car.
And I really thought about doing it,

1183
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:24,450
but I was like, all right, you
just went down to the guy's office.

1184
01:13:24,630 --> 01:13:28,800
You just had a really heated
argument with that fucking guy.

1185
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,280
There was people there witnessed it.
You know what I mean?

1186
01:13:32,281 --> 01:13:34,140
There's camera's in the garage.
If I do it,

1187
01:13:34,170 --> 01:13:38,760
I know I'm going to get fucking caught.
So, uh, actually I did get revenge.

1188
01:13:38,761 --> 01:13:39,571
What am I talking about?

1189
01:13:39,571 --> 01:13:44,571
I know what I did instead I
stood outside the office and uh,

1190
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:52,050
what did I do that's no, no, no. I think
it was still part of the arguments.

1191
01:13:52,051 --> 01:13:55,830
Someone came walking in and they were
getting ready to rent a apartment in the

1192
01:13:55,831 --> 01:13:58,230
building and I told him the story.

1193
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:02,190
I go and I came back off the road and
there's stuff missing and I'm talking to

1194
01:14:02,191 --> 01:14:06,030
this guy and this guy is yelling at me.
I'm telling you the elevators to slow.

1195
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:08,610
And the two people like thanks a lot.
And they walked out.

1196
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:10,740
And then I looked at the guy and I said,
let me tell you something.

1197
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:12,520
I'm a comedian.
I don't work days.

1198
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:16,270
I will sit out here every single day in
a lawn here and I'll tell every person

1199
01:14:16,271 --> 01:14:19,630
who comes walking in there and I saw
the guy getting nervous and I knew I was

1200
01:14:19,631 --> 01:14:23,410
completely full of shit because I had
to go on and on the road again the next

1201
01:14:23,410 --> 01:14:27,520
day. And uh, so yeah,

1202
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:31,270
I never seek revenge and it still bugs
me and I tried to lie to myself going,

1203
01:14:31,271 --> 01:14:34,210
you know what? He'll get
his, that guy will get his,

1204
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:38,530
and you know what I've realized,
uh, those guys don't get this.

1205
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:41,430
They continue to rob and steal, but
I don't know, maybe they miserable.

1206
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:44,490
Do you guys believe in that shit?
Do you think that they, you know,

1207
01:14:44,530 --> 01:14:49,510
rent vengeances mindset of the Lord,
you believe in that shit?

1208
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:53,200
I kind of believe in it and then I'll
let them sometimes I think, well,

1209
01:14:53,201 --> 01:14:55,300
it didn't just some rich
people, right? The Bible.

1210
01:14:56,380 --> 01:15:00,310
So I would feel comfortable being
poor. Yeah. And we fuck you over.

1211
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:04,840
Don't take vengeance on us. Don't worry.
This invisible guy after we'll dead,

1212
01:15:04,870 --> 01:15:06,490
we're dead.
He'll take care of us.

1213
01:15:07,510 --> 01:15:09,190
That's the one thing why I
don't believe in the Bible,

1214
01:15:09,370 --> 01:15:11,320
cause everyone who preaches
it is living this, this,

1215
01:15:11,321 --> 01:15:15,580
this lifestyle that they would
not get into heaven. You know,

1216
01:15:16,210 --> 01:15:18,430
like look at George Bush.
George Bush is a Jesus Freak.

1217
01:15:18,431 --> 01:15:23,110
The guy's out of his fucking mind. You
know, he's out of his fucking mind.

1218
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:27,340
Would Jesus, you know,
somehow take us to war.

1219
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:28,970
I'm not trying to get political here,
let's say,

1220
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:31,570
and the guy did the right thing or
the wrong thing. I don't fucking know.

1221
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:34,660
But I'm just saying, you know,
if I was truly a Jesus Freak,

1222
01:15:34,810 --> 01:15:36,400
I would not advocate going to war.

1223
01:15:36,730 --> 01:15:40,360
And one of the things that scares me
about fucking people get into religion is

1224
01:15:40,361 --> 01:15:44,440
the more religious they get, the more
violent and unaccepting they get up.

1225
01:15:44,441 --> 01:15:45,274
Other people.

1226
01:15:45,790 --> 01:15:48,180
That is one of the most hackiest things
I've ever said because other people have

1227
01:15:48,181 --> 01:15:51,310
made that point. But it's
fucking true. It's true.

1228
01:15:51,311 --> 01:15:53,020
Like I don't give a shit about gay guys,
you know,

1229
01:15:53,021 --> 01:15:55,690
they can fucking blow each other all
day long. What the fuck do I care?

1230
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:59,110
Then I'd heard anybody, you
know, I don't want to see it,

1231
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:01,960
but we have laws against that.

1232
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:04,750
Don't blow your boyfriend out
in the fucking street, you know,

1233
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:09,730
but I think you ought to be able to do it
on a Futon, you know, behind some walls.

1234
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:14,410
I don't think you're going to hell.
I mean,

1235
01:16:14,411 --> 01:16:17,370
for me it would be a hellacious
experience, but you know, all right.

1236
01:16:17,710 --> 01:16:20,950
Just continue on a bill. You made your
point and now you're going to ruin it.

1237
01:16:21,060 --> 01:16:23,620
All right, plow ahead. All
right. Hey Bill. On TV,

1238
01:16:23,621 --> 01:16:28,621
they sometimes talk about how it costs
$11 trillion to have Chris rock come to

1239
01:16:29,141 --> 01:16:31,630
your house and do 15 minutes of stand up.

1240
01:16:32,710 --> 01:16:36,520
How much will it cost to have bill Burke
come over to a fan's house and perform,

1241
01:16:36,950 --> 01:16:41,830
stand up for 50 minutes? When
a great fucking question, um,

1242
01:16:42,310 --> 01:16:45,430
it would cost you, I do it
for, I do it for 12 bucks,

1243
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:52,440
but I would have some riders attached to
it that would up the performance price.

1244
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:56,470
Okay. First off, um, there
has to be some sort of stage.

1245
01:16:57,580 --> 01:16:58,120
Okay.

1246
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:03,040
And it literally could be that brick
part that comes out from your fireplace.

1247
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:05,980
I'll stand on that. I may
be an Ottoman. You know

1248
01:17:08,110 --> 01:17:08,861
what's an automation?

1249
01:17:08,861 --> 01:17:11,660
Is the thing you put your clothes in or
is that the thing you put your feet on?

1250
01:17:11,810 --> 01:17:15,500
I'm talking about the thing you put
your feet on on one of those things.

1251
01:17:15,501 --> 01:17:17,510
And also I have to be helicoptered in.

1252
01:17:18,030 --> 01:17:20,630
Do you have to have a
backyard as big enough?

1253
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:25,040
It's big enough for me to land in.
Okay.

1254
01:17:26,150 --> 01:17:29,540
And then I'm going to get
off the helicopter and I'm
going to be wearing a scarf.

1255
01:17:29,660 --> 01:17:34,160
Silk scarf that you pay for that I will
never address during my performance.

1256
01:17:35,210 --> 01:17:38,210
No one at the party is allowed
to make eye contact with me.

1257
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:43,100
Everyone will sit around the fucking
Automato that thing you put your feet on

1258
01:17:43,130 --> 01:17:47,780
Indian style and I will do my jokes and
I will not look at any of you. I will.

1259
01:17:47,780 --> 01:17:50,240
I will fucking be staring
at the toaster the entire,

1260
01:17:50,310 --> 01:17:53,480
I want to toast her in the back of
the room. I'll do this to 12 bucks.

1261
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:58,610
You pay me $12 you helicopter me in,
you by the scarf.

1262
01:17:58,611 --> 01:18:00,830
I will stand on a fucking
ornament and I will do,

1263
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:04,910
I'll do 25 minutes for 12 bucks.
All right,

1264
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:08,630
you got the fucking 12 bucks and the money
to book the helicopter. I will do it.

1265
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:13,370
I'm really talking to myself and
do a fucking youtube moment and um,

1266
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:17,510
that's it.
But no one can make eye contact with me.

1267
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:20,510
Just like pope of Greenwich
Greenwich Village.

1268
01:18:22,490 --> 01:18:26,600
And you don't say good night to nobody
that when she got to stare at the fucking

1269
01:18:26,601 --> 01:18:31,160
floor when she walks out,
um,

1270
01:18:31,161 --> 01:18:34,130
you know something that's, that's the
tandem. I'm waiting to get back together.

1271
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:37,100
Everybody talks about Walter Matthau
and Jack Lemmon back in the day.

1272
01:18:37,101 --> 01:18:40,010
What about Mickey Work and Eric Roberts?
Can they get together again?

1273
01:18:40,730 --> 01:18:41,451
Nikki work is back.

1274
01:18:41,451 --> 01:18:44,990
I think it's time for those guys to do
another fucking movie before the two

1275
01:18:45,470 --> 01:18:48,980
Goddamn old. So there you go. There's
your, there's your answer. 12 bucks,

1276
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:54,380
the helicopter ride. No eye contact,
a scarf and a fucking Ottoman.

1277
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:57,710
And you've got yourself a comedian,
but not for 50 minutes. All right.

1278
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:01,520
Give me 24 bucks.
I'll do the 50 minutes.

1279
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:09,350
Alright, here we go. Um, overrated.

1280
01:19:09,380 --> 01:19:13,850
Underrated. Okay. Uh,
underrated. Um, how awesome.

1281
01:19:13,851 --> 01:19:17,690
Whoever the first guy was to
coin the phrase mustache ride.

1282
01:19:18,740 --> 01:19:20,870
I have to admit, I've never
heard of this, this phrase,

1283
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:25,310
how much confidence and creepiness
does one have to ooze in order to say

1284
01:19:25,311 --> 01:19:28,760
something like that to an actual living,
breathing woman?

1285
01:19:29,150 --> 01:19:32,000
Probably happen sometime during this,
the 70s,

1286
01:19:32,390 --> 01:19:37,310
when everyone was sporting a
mustache and a leisure suit. Oh,

1287
01:19:37,311 --> 01:19:39,800
is that what you did back in the day?
Actually,

1288
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:44,060
I didn't like stick a mustache
ride. Eh, I don't know.

1289
01:19:44,061 --> 01:19:47,660
I've never heard of that one. Um, oh,
here's a good one. Uh, underrated.

1290
01:19:47,661 --> 01:19:52,130
What red wine will do to your
erection? True Story. A while back,

1291
01:19:52,131 --> 01:19:54,980
I had a girl over for dinner at my place.

1292
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:58,640
I drank about three glasses of wine
I was expecting to make out with her.

1293
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:02,780
It was kind of a first date, so I wasn't
expecting the opportunity to get laid.

1294
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:04,970
So evidently this guy kept drinking.

1295
01:20:04,971 --> 01:20:08,310
So while the opportunity arose
to get laid and I didn't,

1296
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:13,110
I was sitting on the edge
of my bed pulling my dick
like I was trying to get an

1297
01:20:13,111 --> 01:20:16,150
old lawn mower to start and nothing,
you know,

1298
01:20:16,151 --> 01:20:19,790
embarrassing this to be jerking off in
front of a girl while apologize. I think

1299
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:26,820
I've been there. Um, I can never
look that girl in the eye again.

1300
01:20:27,090 --> 01:20:31,770
I've heard the term whiskey Dick Button.
Never heard a mention of red wine.

1301
01:20:32,190 --> 01:20:36,120
How come? No one ever told me
that that could happen. Um,

1302
01:20:36,150 --> 01:20:41,010
I think whiskey Dick just sort of was
supposed to be all encompassing of alcohol

1303
01:20:41,011 --> 01:20:44,220
in general. I think whiskey Dick,
I guess has a decent ring to it.

1304
01:20:45,030 --> 01:20:48,000
Beer Dick doesn't sound good wine.
Dick.

1305
01:20:49,830 --> 01:20:52,440
Actually whiskey Dick doesn't sound good
either. I've never liked that either.

1306
01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:57,300
I don't like that. Expression can be
some sort of alliteration going on there

1307
01:20:58,860 --> 01:21:03,480
for beer cock. That's
not good. Wine. Willie,

1308
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:06,960
Willie, Willie. Why? No, I don't
know what it is, but no whiskey.

1309
01:21:06,961 --> 01:21:11,070
Dick Means all alcohol. But no one
ever explained that because I you,

1310
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:13,530
you took it literally like,
Oh, don't drink whiskey.

1311
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:15,180
I won't be able to get an erection,

1312
01:21:15,210 --> 01:21:19,740
but evidently I can drink fucking red wine
all night. Like some fucking divorced,

1313
01:21:19,741 --> 01:21:22,320
48 year old woman with two kids.

1314
01:21:22,321 --> 01:21:24,960
What's wrong with you as a man that
you sit there drinking red wine?

1315
01:21:26,730 --> 01:21:31,560
Was that her idea?
Were you wearing a scarf?

1316
01:21:31,561 --> 01:21:34,860
I bet you where you should
have been helicoptered in
that the have bottle of red

1317
01:21:34,861 --> 01:21:37,560
wine. All right. Overrated.

1318
01:21:37,590 --> 01:21:41,610
How excited people get over
getting their tax refund.

1319
01:21:42,210 --> 01:21:44,490
You know something that's one
of the best overrated ever.

1320
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:48,450
That's a fucking great
one. Uh, someone's like,

1321
01:21:48,460 --> 01:21:50,580
I'm getting 3000 back from the government,

1322
01:21:50,970 --> 01:21:53,640
2000 back from the 16,000 they,

1323
01:21:53,730 --> 01:21:56,070
they took from me throughout the year.

1324
01:21:56,610 --> 01:21:59,790
And the kicker is that while I was
sitting in my accountant's office,

1325
01:22:00,060 --> 01:22:03,570
I don't really use government. I realized
I don't really use government services.

1326
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:06,180
I don't have any kids in school.
I live in New York City,

1327
01:22:06,181 --> 01:22:07,770
so I don't drive on state roads.

1328
01:22:08,070 --> 01:22:11,880
I'm 27 and I've never needed a
cop throughout my whole life.

1329
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:15,120
I never called the fire department.
I'd never been on welfare.

1330
01:22:15,121 --> 01:22:18,720
The only thing that governor has done
for me in the past year is pick up my

1331
01:22:18,721 --> 01:22:21,870
garbage and make sure
I get more HD channels.

1332
01:22:22,170 --> 01:22:25,650
I realize I have to pay taxes and
ultimately I don't mind doing it,

1333
01:22:25,950 --> 01:22:27,030
but in hindsight,

1334
01:22:27,031 --> 01:22:31,770
13,000 is way too much to pay to
have someone take away your garbage.

1335
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:33,750
That's more than a thousand bucks a month.

1336
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:38,490
I could drive a top of the line
Lexus for that type of money. Yeah,

1337
01:22:38,491 --> 01:22:41,520
and put your garbage in the trunk and
take it over to the dump. Exactly.

1338
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:45,030
Well know what the funny thing is about
people getting their tax refund back.

1339
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:46,730
They're all excited and they don't read.

1340
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:50,700
They never stopped to think that you gave
the government an interest free loan.

1341
01:22:51,570 --> 01:22:54,990
Like you could have had that three
grand plus the money that you owed the

1342
01:22:54,991 --> 01:22:57,960
government shitting in your
bank account or whatever,

1343
01:22:59,190 --> 01:23:02,370
earning interest and then the end of the
year you could just give him the money

1344
01:23:02,371 --> 01:23:06,490
that you owed him. He should. What does
that he claimed zero. Is that what it is?

1345
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:08,560
That's what you should do.
And then you

1346
01:23:10,450 --> 01:23:15,160
get some sort of psycho accountant to
whittle the fucking charges down and then

1347
01:23:15,161 --> 01:23:18,550
you pay him. That's how you
do it in order is most people,

1348
01:23:18,551 --> 01:23:21,820
they don't want to deal, you know, and
they just kind of look at that dude,

1349
01:23:21,821 --> 01:23:25,420
it's money in the bank. No, it isn't. It
isn't money in the bank. It's money lost.

1350
01:23:25,450 --> 01:23:26,230
That's what it is.

1351
01:23:26,230 --> 01:23:28,990
And then what do they do when they get
their fucking money back? What do they do?

1352
01:23:29,290 --> 01:23:34,290
They go out and they take it and they go
out and buy a shiny liability that went

1353
01:23:34,451 --> 01:23:38,230
on. I brought a fucking flat screen dead.
That's what I did. And that's great.

1354
01:23:38,770 --> 01:23:41,800
That's great. He realized the
second you hung it on your wall.

1355
01:23:41,801 --> 01:23:46,060
It's worth 600 bucks
now. You dumb fuck. Um,

1356
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:48,880
underrated mom and pop hardware stores,

1357
01:23:48,970 --> 01:23:53,970
emailing classic Bruce Lee
Kung Fu movies and good girls.

1358
01:23:55,540 --> 01:23:58,780
Oh, good girls is so
underrated. So underrated.

1359
01:23:58,810 --> 01:24:03,670
Why do we always pick the
horse fellows? Huh? Why?

1360
01:24:04,090 --> 01:24:07,000
You know why?
Because you dick your Dick.

1361
01:24:08,170 --> 01:24:12,070
It's gift fucking Dick. I
don't even explain it. I
don't even need to explain it.

1362
01:24:12,790 --> 01:24:17,140
It just goes back to that dump discovery
channel thing. The same way the lions,

1363
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:20,620
you know the lionesses is sitting
there and when they look at the herd,

1364
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:22,960
do they go after the best gazelle?

1365
01:24:23,220 --> 01:24:26,230
Now they go after the weakest
one cause it's the easiest kill.

1366
01:24:28,090 --> 01:24:32,520
That's what it is. It's fucking
wanted is all right. A overrated, um,

1367
01:24:32,710 --> 01:24:34,660
giant corporate stores.

1368
01:24:34,730 --> 01:24:38,950
I phones Jackie Chan
movies and Valentine's Day,

1369
01:24:39,430 --> 01:24:42,100
really one day out of the
year where the price of roses,

1370
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:46,240
teddy bears and chocolates skyrockets
because some naked baby wants to fly

1371
01:24:46,241 --> 01:24:48,130
around,
shoot narrows and people's asses.

1372
01:24:48,910 --> 01:24:52,750
Just surprise your girl on
a random day with that shit.

1373
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:57,250
She won't expect it and will appreciate
a hundred times more than if you did it

1374
01:24:57,251 --> 01:25:00,880
on Valentine's state. Could not agree
with you more. I got to say something.

1375
01:25:00,881 --> 01:25:05,320
You guys are really up in your fucking
game here. You know, great questions,

1376
01:25:05,321 --> 01:25:08,380
great underrated,
overrated, great stories.

1377
01:25:09,610 --> 01:25:11,200
I mean I didn't have to do shit this week.

1378
01:25:11,201 --> 01:25:15,880
I just sat here and fucking read
it like a fucking local newscaster,

1379
01:25:17,650 --> 01:25:21,510
which is kind of good cause I think I was
kind of off my game today sitting here,

1380
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:25,030
my freezing fucking cold apartment.
I got this awful heater.

1381
01:25:26,170 --> 01:25:28,540
You know what I mean?
It's the only place where I live in.

1382
01:25:28,541 --> 01:25:30,970
It's a really cool building,
but it's old as fuck.

1383
01:25:31,420 --> 01:25:34,450
It's like one of those old time Hollywood,
you know,

1384
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:38,170
back when it said Hollywood land,
that's when this thing was built.

1385
01:25:38,171 --> 01:25:42,190
It was made in the uh,
late 1930s.

1386
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:45,520
I like living in an old places like
that, but you know, sucks the heat them.

1387
01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:49,480
And I always like think about the
conversations, you know what I mean?

1388
01:25:51,330 --> 01:25:52,810
Like shit that happened. Like, you know,

1389
01:25:52,811 --> 01:25:56,260
I bet Charlie chaplain came over here
and bank some want to be starlet in my

1390
01:25:56,261 --> 01:25:57,094
shower.

1391
01:25:58,060 --> 01:26:01,690
Is Little Hitler mustache getting
all fucking wet. You know,

1392
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:09,620
I'm just picturing Charlie Chaplin
still wearing that fucking that hat and

1393
01:26:09,621 --> 01:26:11,630
making that I'm fucking
you real good face.

1394
01:26:11,631 --> 01:26:13,130
You know when you bite your lower lip.

1395
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:21,590
Oh he was probably all nervous too
because what happened to fatty Arbuckle?

1396
01:26:21,620 --> 01:26:25,340
But he still had to do it. You know, cause
he didn't pick a good girl. He doesn't,

1397
01:26:25,490 --> 01:26:28,910
he went over here and fucked the whore.
You know?

1398
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:31,310
That's what I always want.
You ever wonder about?

1399
01:26:31,370 --> 01:26:33,680
You want to get it all apartments?
You just wonder what the fuck happened.

1400
01:26:35,090 --> 01:26:37,130
You know like this,
this place was around

1401
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:41,210
like right before World War II.

1402
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:44,810
All the conversations that have
taken place, all that stuff,

1403
01:26:45,470 --> 01:26:48,740
the amount of people from different
generations bitching about how this heater

1404
01:26:48,741 --> 01:26:53,420
doesn't work. I don't know. The red scare,

1405
01:26:54,230 --> 01:26:58,610
Kennedy getting whacked
the white flight in Detroit.

1406
01:26:58,611 --> 01:27:00,140
I don't know why I just brought that up.
You know why?

1407
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:03,770
Cause the guy fucking shaves my head from
Detroit and he lived through all that

1408
01:27:03,771 --> 01:27:06,050
shit.
Detroit is such a sad fucking city.

1409
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:09,860
This guy was telling me how back in the
day some of the richest people in the

1410
01:27:09,861 --> 01:27:13,970
world lived in Detroit back when the
big three was the big three in the Ford

1411
01:27:13,971 --> 01:27:16,580
family. They all live there and
because they had all this cash,

1412
01:27:16,850 --> 01:27:20,810
all these great department stores,
all these museums in Detroit,

1413
01:27:21,890 --> 01:27:26,540
look at it. Years later.
Eight Mile Eminem, kid rock

1414

1416
01:27:35,870 --> 01:27:38,980
Well that's the name of the fucking
waste management in Massachusetts.

1417
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:44,690
A garbage dumpster
dumpster. Right. All right.

1418
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:49,190
I guess that's it. That's, you know I
had rainy Monday energy on this one,

1419
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,590
but um,
what are you gonna do?

1420
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,530
You can't have a bitch about these fucking
things cause they're free. All right?

1421
01:27:54,531 --> 01:27:59,150
And if you are, go fuck yourself
it cheap. Fuck. You know,

1422
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:01,460
I've actually had, you know,
people criticize my podcast.

1423
01:28:01,930 --> 01:28:05,570
Dylan wasn't as good as lists. Weeks.
Rarely do you feel cheated out of money.

1424
01:28:05,571 --> 01:28:09,800
You fucking cunt. You know, and
Howard, it is the Babel by yourself.

Show. It's a show to help benefit,

1454
01:30:04,590 --> 01:30:08,280
uh, hungry people. People
don't have any food, you know,

1455
01:30:08,610 --> 01:30:11,130
and it's not starving people
either. It's just, you know,

1456
01:30:11,131 --> 01:30:14,130
like you have a busy been driving
around time like I fuck, I'm starving.

1457
01:30:14,250 --> 01:30:19,140
Those kinds of people, people who
actually knew like have eaten that day,

1458
01:30:19,141 --> 01:30:22,080
but they haven't eaten in six hours
so they feel like they're starving.

1459
01:30:22,110 --> 01:30:24,120
We're actually going to help him out.
You know,

1460
01:30:24,121 --> 01:30:26,340
cause everybody's helping out
those starving kids in Africa.

1461
01:30:26,341 --> 01:30:27,450
Anybody can do that shit.

1462
01:30:27,630 --> 01:30:30,690
Who actually helps out start from
people who technically aren't starving.

1463
01:30:31,350 --> 01:30:34,410
They just haven't eaten in awhile and
their bodies are now breaking down the

1464
01:30:34,411 --> 01:30:37,050
muscle that they built up at the gym.
All right.

1465
