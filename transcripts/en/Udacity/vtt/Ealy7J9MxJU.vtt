00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well, the line could certainly stretch--that would throw off your measurement.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It actually was hard to accurately measure time.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
They often use things like hourglasses and some mechanisms

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
but it is still difficult to be accurate and currents is the big one.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
If all this water is also moving to the right with some speed,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
well I would expect this log to more or less follow behind your boat--

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
that doesn't mean your boat isn't moving--it just means that it is not moving relative to the water.

00:00:24.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Clearly we knew the better method, what can we use.
