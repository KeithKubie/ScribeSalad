00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.810
Congestion control has two main goals. The first

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.460
is to use network resources efficiently. Going back to

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.250
our sink analogy, we'd like to feel the

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.570
sink as quickly as possible. Fairness, on the other

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.850
hand, ensures that all the senders essentially get

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.424
their fair share of resources. A final goal, of

00:00:19.424 --> 00:00:22.800
course, is to avoid congestion collapse. Congestion collapse isn't

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.224
just a theory. It's actually been frequently observed in,

00:00:25.224 --> 00:00:26.420
in many different networks.
