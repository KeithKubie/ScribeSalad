00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.550
We're on problem 84.

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:09.100
On a company-sponsored cruise,
2/3 of the passengers were

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.010
company employees, and the
remaining passengers were

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.120
their guests.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:20.510
So we could say, employees is
equal to 2/3 of passengers.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.910
And I guess we could also say
that guests are equal to 1/3

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.420
of passengers.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.020
The remainder are guests.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.130
If 3/4 of the company employee
passengers were managers, what

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.330
was the number of company
employee passengers who were

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.380
not managers?

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.760
OK.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.190
So the second statement, in at
least the problem statement,

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:54.000
it says if 3/4 of the company
employee passengers were

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:04.540
managers-- so 3/4 of E were
managers, if I read that

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:11.140
statement-- what was the number
of company employee

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.790
passengers who were
not managers?

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:22.130
So essentially, they want to
know what 1/4 of E is, right?

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.410
This is what they're asking.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.940
Because they want to know,
what were the number of

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.920
company employee passengers
that were not managers?

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.260
And 3/4 were managers, 1/4
were not managers.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.930
So if we could figure out P, we
would be able to figure out

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.640
E, and we'd be able to
figure out 1/4 E.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.990
If we were able to figure out
guests, we could then use that

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.570
to figure out P, which we could
use to figure out E,

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.020
which we could then
figure out 1/4 E.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.220
So that's how we should be
thinking about it, not that we

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.150
should be spending that
much time on it.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.480
Problem number one.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.720
There were 690 passengers.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.560
690 is equal to P.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.660
Well, we'd be done, right?

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.720
Because E is equal to 2/3
P, and then we want to

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.580
know what 1/4 E is.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:10.259
So the non-manager employees
would be 1/4 times E, which is

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.580
just 2/3 times P.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.460
Times 690.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.480
And that would be our answer.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.870
So one alone is sufficient.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.480
And then statement number two.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.350
There were 230 passengers
who were guests

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.160
of the company employees.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:31.040
So they're essentially saying
that guests are equal to 230.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.850
And then we could use this
information, that guests are

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.570
just 1/3 of P.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.970
And then, of course, from
there you could solve.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.890
You could multiply 3 times both
sides of the equation to

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.610
figure out that P
is equal to 690.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.950
Which is the same information
that they gave in one, which

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.040
was enough to solve
the problem.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.840
So two alone is also
sufficient.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.310
So they are each independently
sufficient

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.380
to solve the problem.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.380
That problem is confusing,
just with the language.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.700
Company, employee, manager,
passenger,

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.390
guest. It was very confusing.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.190
85.

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.040
In the x-y plane, does
the point 4 comma

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.460
12 lie on line k?

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.810
OK, this is interesting.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.560
So let me draw a line k, and
I'll worry about the point 4

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.320
comma 12 later.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.120
So let's see.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.650
Let me look at the points that
they do say lie on k.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.850
So if this is the x-axis,
that's the y-axis.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.160
Statement one tells us that
the point 1, 7 lies on k.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.960
So the point 1 comma
7 lies on k.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.040
And then they also tell us that
the point--- that alone

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.020
isn't going let me know if the
point 4 comma 12 lies on it.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.652
So 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:03:52.652 --> 00:03:54.280
4 comma 12.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.400
It might be up here.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.480
This is the point that
we care about.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.240
If you can see that.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.770
Let me scroll down.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.140
4 comma 12.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.750
So if the line looks like that,
maybe it goes through,

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:06.790
but the line could
be like that.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.830
So statement number one
alone isn't enough.

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.430
Statement number two says the
point minus 2 comma 2.

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.900
x is minus 2, y is positive 2.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.490
So they're saying
that lies on it.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.260
Eyeballing this line, k, it
seems like 4 comma 12 could

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.060
very well lie on it.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.240
But we have to do a little bit
of math to figure it out.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.120
So first of all, just statement
two by itself

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.530
doesn't help us, because this
line could go anywhere.

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.090
You need two points to just
know what the line is.

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.200
And so how do we figure out
if the point 4 comma

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.630
12 is on this line?

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.390
Well, the easiest way to do it
is to figure out the slope--

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:53.620
well, I don't know if it's the
easiest way, but it's the way

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.280
I would think about doing it--
is to figure out the slope of

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.100
the line, and then extend that
slope here and see if the

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.440
point 4 comma 12 lies on it.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.260
So let's see, what's the
slope of this line?

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.870
So when we went up 7 minus 2.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.270
So the rise is 5.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.130
When you go up 5, we
went over how much?

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.310
1 minus minus 2.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.450
We went over 3, right?

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.730
So for every 3 that you move
over, you go up 5.

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.910
That's the easiest way
to think about it.

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.220
So we're going from x is equal
to 1 to x is equal to 4, so

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.700
we're going to the right by 3.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.810
And so we should
be going up 5.

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.740
So 5 plus 7, sure enough,
is equal to 12.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.250
So if you just extend the
slope, it does hit the

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.540
point 4 comma 12.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.660
Well, actually you know what?

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.300
I just wasted a lot of your
time, because we just have to

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.110
know whether the data
is sufficient

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.280
to answer the question.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.670
We don't have to prove that
the question is true.

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.210
I've just proven to you
that 4 common 12

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:59.580
does lie on the line.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.460
But you could have just said,
oh, well, you know what?

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.670
Statement number one gives
me a point on the line.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.850
That alone isn't enough
to solve the problem.

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:12.860
Statement number two gives
me another point.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.750
And then at this point, if
you're really taking the GMAT

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.900
and time matters, you just
say, hey, I got two

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.140
points for this line.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.150
Two points is everything I need
to know about a line.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.700
Once I know two points on a
line, I can figure out if any

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.000
other point is on that line.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.810
I'm done.

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.190
Both statements combined
are sufficient.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.190
You wouldn't have to do all of
this stuff that I did, which

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.290
would waste your time.

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.010
But just to prove to
you that you could

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.310
figure it, I did that.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:34.790
But anyway.

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.750
I have to admit I did waste
your time a little bit.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:37.810
You should just immediately
say, oh, I got

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:38.620
two points on a line.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.870
Once I have two points, I can
completely figure out if any

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.550
other point lies on that line.

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.220
86.

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:53.480
The length of the edging that
surrounds circular garden K--

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.720
OK, so we have two gardens,
it looks like.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.090
So we have circular garden K,
and then we have circular

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.630
garden-- let's see,
what does it say?

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.050
It is 1/2 the length of the
edge that surrounds

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.110
circular garden G.

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:11.320
So this is circular garden G.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.400
This is K.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.810
This is G.

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:15.770
So they're saying the length of
the edging that surrounds

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:20.700
circular garden K is 1/2 the
length of the edging that

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.070
surrounds circular garden G.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.590
So we could say circumference
of K-- right, that's the

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:29.210
edging that surrounds it--
is equal to 1/2 the

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:32.230
circumference of G.

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:33.200
Fair enough.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.970
What is the area of garden K?

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:41.420
Assume that the edging
has negligible width.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.450
Well, a couple of things.

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:45.860
If we know the circumference,
we know the area, right?

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.640
Because the circumference is 2
pi r, and once we know r, area

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:50.840
is pi r squared.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.170
So if we can figure out the
circumference of K, then we

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:55.520
know its area.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.210
And likewise, if we know
anything about the radius, or

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:02.300
the diameter, or the area of
G, we can figure out its

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:02.750
circumference.

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:03.600
We know its area.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:10.140
We can use the formula, area
equals pi r squared to figure

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:11.020
out what r is.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.720
And then once you figure out
what r is, you could just

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.210
figure out that circumference
is equal to 2 pi r.

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:17.980
So if you have any of this
information, you're able to

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:19.970
figure out any of
the rest of it.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:24.555
So statement number one says,
the area of G is equal to 25

00:08:24.555 --> 00:08:26.580
pi square meters.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:27.870
So let me write it.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:34.169
So immediately you should say,
hey, if I know the area of G,

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:36.020
I can figure out the
radius of G.

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.460
And if I know the radius of
G, I can figure out the

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:39.750
circumference of G.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:41.799
If I know the circumference
of G, I can figure out the

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:43.159
circumference of K.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:45.770
If I know the circumference of
K I can figure out the radius

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:49.780
of K, and if I know the radius
of K, I know the area of K.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:51.370
You shouldn't have to calculate
any of that.

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:52.270
So this is enough.

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:54.240
This is sufficient.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.080
Statement two.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.960
And maybe I'll do that for you,
just to show you that it

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:58.570
can be done.

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:00.950
But hopefully it's making
some sense.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:04.590
The edging around G is
10 pi meters long.

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:08.060
So they're actually telling us
that the circumference of G is

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.500
equal to 10 pi.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.550
So this is even easier.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:11.750
They're giving us this.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:15.780
That means the circumference of
K is 5 pi, which means that

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.850
we can figure out the radius
of K and we could

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:19.920
figure out the area.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:23.750
So this is also sufficient
to solve the problem.

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:25.640
And just so you don't take my
word for it, let me just show

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.640
you how quickly you could
figure it out.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:33.150
If the area of G is 25 pi, that
means that pi times the

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:36.960
radius squared of G
is equal to 25 pi.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.960
That means that the radius
is equal to 5, right?

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.390
Cancel out the pi
on both sides. r

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:42.590
squared is equal to 5.

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:43.900
That means the radius is 5.

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.850
That means the circumference
is 2 pi times this.

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:51.170
So that means that the
circumference of G is equal to

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:55.060
2 pi times 5, which is 10 pi,
which is exactly what

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.430
statement two told us.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.100
And then from there, we could
figure out the circumference

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.670
of K, which is 1/2 of that.

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:03.700
So circumference of K
is equal to 5 pi.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.500
And then we know that 2 pi
times the radius of K

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.470
is equal to 5 pi.

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:09.670
Divide both sides by pi.

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:12.260
We know that the radius
is equal to 5/2.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.740
And then the area of K would
be pi times this squared.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:19.960
So it would be pi times 25/4,
and we'd be done.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.470
But all of this was
a waste of time.

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:25.120
I just wanted to show you that
once you have the radius or

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.480
the circumference, or the area
of either of these, you're

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.900
able to figure out
everything else.

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.240
And I'm out of time.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.050
See you in the next video.
