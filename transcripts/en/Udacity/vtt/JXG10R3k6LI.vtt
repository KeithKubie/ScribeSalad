00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.390
Ladies and gentleman, I am Agent B.of MIB with an important announcement.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.910
Thousands of alien bugs have been invading our code.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.766
The invasion threatens our flight navigation systems.

00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:17.347
Our financial infrastructure and our ability to play Candy Crush.

00:00:17.347 --> 00:00:27.347
[MUSIC]

00:00:30.267 --> 00:00:34.180
To fight back, MIB has invented a secret weapon.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.483
The code review and

00:00:35.483 --> 00:00:41.034
assembled a crack team of reviewers gather in our headquarters in New York City.

00:00:41.034 --> 00:00:46.368
[NOISE] Gentlemen, would you now introduce

00:00:46.368 --> 00:00:52.302
yourself to the public, first our moderator.

00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:56.390
&gt;&gt; Hello, I am Moderator, sometimes also called the controller.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.898
My name is 3.8.

00:00:57.898 --> 00:00:59.744
I'm a professor in computer science, and

00:00:59.744 --> 00:01:02.786
they call me 3.8 because it took me 3.8 billion years to evolve.

00:01:02.786 --> 00:01:06.712
&gt;&gt; Next, our Reader.

00:01:06.712 --> 00:01:09.490
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm the Reader, Dr. Bug.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.700
They call me Dr. Bug because I smash bugs.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.920
&gt;&gt; Here's our recorder.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.610
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Crazy Bob.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.130
They call me Crazy Bob because I'm crazy about Ada.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.700
I'm the tech lead on our avionics project.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.970
We delivered 1.4 million lines of safety-critical Ada code.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.310
&gt;&gt; Next we have Inspector Fra Elbertus.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.280
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Fra Elbertus.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.490
I'm the friar of doom.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.880
I was the originator of the sticky net virus when I consulted for

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.920
one of those three letter government agencies.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.380
You haven't heard of sticky net because it was so

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.880
evil, they had to redo it and call it Stuxnet.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.390
&gt;&gt; And our other inspector, Byte.Me.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.960
&gt;&gt; Hi everyone my name's Byte.Me.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.640
I used to have a back story, but I pseudo RN'd it years ago.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.200
I like coffee, code and Reddit.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.540
That's about it.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.980
&gt;&gt; Finally, I will also be an inspector.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.319
Now ladies and gentlemen, let me show you the first invasion site.

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:08.169
A key piece of software infrastructure called BlankCount.java.

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:18.170
