00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080
Hello, everybody. Doug Walker here,

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.700
and welcome to The Last Airbender V-Logs.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.700
As you can tell this was actually shot right after I did the intro,

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.180
so I have seen the very first episode:

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.140
uh, "The Boy in the Iceberg".

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.280
And, uh,

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.300
First impressions, I guess.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.220
'cuz, it's interesting a lot of people say

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.460
"Once you watch it you're really gonna be, like, sucked in

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.400
and you wanna see more and more and more."

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.900
I don't know if this started off as like a movie, where they run some of the episodes together.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.100
And the first episode is very good, and it's very creative.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.800
I will admit, it didn't-

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.720
It didn't suck me in like something like Lost or Game of Thrones did,

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.160
but, then again,

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.800
It is a Nickolodeon show.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.400
Which everyone says like,

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.500
"Oh, no this totally changes, you know, like the way Nickolodeon shows look."

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.720
And I believe it,

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.380
'cuz it is a very impressive looking show.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.300
What did sort of, uh, throw me-

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.880
I don't wanna say "throw me for a loop", and it's not totally fair to say this, but,

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.940
And maybe it's a good thing and bad thing is that

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.400
watching the first episode I had to sort of remind myself:

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.700
"Oh, yeah, this is for kids."

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.240
I think there's something about the design and even kinda the pacing and the layout,

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.480
Where it sort of fools you into almost thinking, like:

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.820
"Oh, yeah this is a movie."

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.240
You know there's this scene where they're looking inside this uh, looks like a submarine,

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.920
and it's very quiet.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.560
And they've got these great angles,

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.600
and there's no talking and no music you just hear the echoes of the ship,

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.720
and,

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.860
it'll be interesting, from here on to see

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.020
if this is, like,

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.640
see if the rest of the show goes like this.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.440
And of course, a lot of you probably already know,

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.360
but as someone just coming in,

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.360
I was impressed by it,

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.560
and I think somebody also going in

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.720
with a lot of hype behind it,

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.380
is probably not the best way to go in, I realize,

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.260
because, automatically you're going to be like:

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.440
"Well, that first episode didn't totally pull me in."

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.920
and stuff like that, but again,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.100
It's a series and it's an intro.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.860
Uhh...

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.880
And, you know, for an intro, it was very interesting, and...

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.980
Literally as it begins, it says like, you know,

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:13.500
"The four nations, the Fire Nations, the Earth Nations, the... Heart Nations -"

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.460
I'm sure everybody's made that joke.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.460
Um, but...

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.100
They're given this back story, and at first I'm thinking:

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.140
"Oh my god, are kids going to be able to follow this?

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.460
This is, like, a lot to take in."

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.280
And then immediately goes to,

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.460
uh, you know, the brother and sister who are making jokes,

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.820
and, you know, they sort of sound-

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.300
the brother especially is a bit of a wise cracker, and stuff,

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.560
and I start going, "Oh yeah. That's right. Kid's show."

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.660
But,

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.960
Again, that's the balance.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.980
That's what you gotta put up with, I realize.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.160
And, I like the fact that, um,

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.440
They sound like kids, the brother not quite so much,

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.600
maybe he's a teenager, but-

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.040
but these sound like real kids.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.800
And I don't know if they're played by adults or not,

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.640
but they do a good job.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.980
and I think what grabbed me the most,

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.380
or what I found the most interesting.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.240
Outside the designs and the backgrounds, those are looking wonderful,

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.620
uh, is the animation itself. And the animation is very much,

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.220
obviously anime influenced, to a point where people could probably confuse it for anime,

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.820
but you can definitely tell it's American.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.220
And there is something about American motion and Japanese motion that is very different,

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.500
'cuz Japanese motion seems to be,

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.900
they put all their animation into the action, I mean, like, ALL OF IT.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.780
And then the rest of it is like,

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.140
you know, there's a lot of close ups like this, of someone talking and looking at something,

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.620
you don't see the mouth moving,

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.420
because all the animation went into the action.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.860
But what's so clever about it is that they hide it very well

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.920
by getting very stylized shots and stylized angles.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.620
American animation is much more about the motion.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.040
So here you have them constantly...

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.160
Constantly in motion,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.120
though, it's interesting 'cuz you could probably see where some arguments came up,

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.880
particularly in the humour,

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.740
because, like when somebody is shocked by something,

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.420
usual American animation will do, like, three frames of a person, "huh?"

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.860
Like that. Where a Japanese animation would just have a person here, and then the next frame he's here.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.940
So...

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.400
And you see that happen here a few times,

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.180
Like when eyes open up, it's not like, you know, a frame or two of them opening up.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.320
It's just open.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.140
Uh...

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.720
And that's a stylistic choice,

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.260
I know that's just part of Japanese animation.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.000
So, it's an interesting balance.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.780
This is probably, so far, uh...

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.880
One of the more interesting balances between, sorta the Japanese style and the American style,

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.480
that I've seen, not that I've seen much... Nickelodeon/anime imitation shows.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:41.340
Uh...

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.980
Okay, for example, I did see a little bit of that show Teen Titans,

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.960
And...

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.120
Not the newer one, whatever the...

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.460
whatever the one that came out like, what, five, six years ago. Something like that, maybe even older.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.940
Uh, came out, and that was obviously trying to, you know, mimic anime.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.300
Uh, with all the big, over-the-top stuff,

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.980
and the big sweat drop and stuff like that.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.240
I can't stand that.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.240
And I know that's a style. If you like it, great.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.740
It drives me insane.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.080
This is a lot- This is a nice medium.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.140
I like the medium that they have here.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.520
Sometimes, the comedy's a little awkward,

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.920
Uh, again, maybe 'cuz I'm just not used to...

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.380
That really quick animation, maybe I'll warm up to it.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:23.360
Um...

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.820
But so far it's an interesting intro,

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.260
and it has a lot of mystery behind it.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.520
It gives you the backstory but at the same time,

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.400
You know, what exactly is the story behind this prince guy?

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.820
And why are the Fire... Why is the Fire Nation a bunch of A-holes?

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.020
and why are they looking to take over?

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.020
and, you know, how is the war going?

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.280
I like stories where something really big is going on...

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.380
Out there, some sort of big battle,

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.840
and yet, the, you know,

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.800
identifiable characters, the young people,

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.680
are off somewhere, and they want to help, and they can't,

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.940
you know, until something comes along to...

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.720
throw them in there, but it's not...

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.780
It's not quite hammered in as much as,

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.780
You know, a lot of other shows and movies like to do it.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.540
Um...

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.380
And the fact that is a show allows so much more time,

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.280
you know, like...

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.040
I don't know are they gonna- are they gonna go to the North Pole?

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.560
Is that the next episode?

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.520
I mean, I like- I like not knowing anything about this show going in.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.600
Uh...

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.100
So with that said, I don't know how many of the comments I'm going to read,

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.400
'cuz I know some people may give it away.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.360
And I want you guys to feel free to, you know, comment and talk about it.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:27.120
Um

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.080
But, uh, the last thing I'll say before I sign off here is the, uh,

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.060
Uh, about the first episode is the...

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.660
You know, I was talking about the designs. I love the animals in this.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.640
I've only seen, I think, two now.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.880
One is a giant flying bison.

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.700
Which, just, props for creativity, man

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.140
that is fucking weird.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.640
And the other is,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.320
which I find this so strange, they're penguins.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.240
They just say they're penguins, but they're...

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.220
Clearly not regular "panguin"-

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:56.720
Penguins.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.980
They look like a mix between penguins and otters,

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.700
and they sled on them, and I like that.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.460
I like that they sort of create a world that's similar to ours,

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:07.540
but it's also one that they can kind of interact in, in their own way.

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:11.460
Even the, uh, Avatar boy, he seems very...

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.700
Instead of getting up using his legs or, you know, or whatever, standing up,

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.940
he can just use his power, the wind power just to sort of...

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.260
have the wind push him up.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.020
I love little touches like that.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.700
Or there's this scene where the girl gets really angry,

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.480
and she accidentally bends the water, uh, behind her and cracks it,

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.060
and isn't even aware she does it.

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.300
Little things like that, those are great touches.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.280
And I think it makes a world much more believable and livable.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.200
And maybe that's one of the big attractions about the show, I dunno, I'll have to see.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.360
But, uh,

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.720
It was a good first episode- and of course,

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.860
Finally get to see Mako ("may-ko"), I know it's "mah-ko", but everyone's called him "may-ko",

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:50.040
so I'm just gonna stick to that, 'cuz that's the joke now, I guess.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:50.700
Um.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.320
Finally see him as the prince's, uh- is that his uncle?

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.320
I dunno, I'm sure a lot of you are gonna chew me up for it.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:57.820
Um...

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:58.900
But,

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.140
And yeah, boy, something about...

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.160
'Cuz this is the show everyone, when I first made the Mako joke,

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.160
everybody said, "That's the guy from Avatar, come on, come on."

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.040
And it is interesting, 'cuz he sounds so different,

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:15.300
from, something like when he did Splinter in the Ninja Turtles Movie.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:20.180
Uh, something about that, sounded a little bit more slurred, and sort of like half awake.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.400
And in this one he sounds very...

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.500
He sounds very dignified.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.120
And, you know, like a warrior who's been through a lot, but...

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.620
Still has a good sorta sense of humour, too, so I'm...

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:35.880
Even just seeing a few bits of that character, I see what people sort of admired about his performance,

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:37.740
'cuz I can already hear it, I'm like,

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:40.640
"This guy's... Like is probably the most interesting character so far."

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.040
I just want to know what his story is,

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.580
and you already feel, sorta that conflict of, you know,

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:49.100
should he help this prince, should he, sort of,

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.860
you know, make a compromise with his teachings, or should he...

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:56.820
You know, really stick to what he knows is right,

00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:00.220
but,  you know, time is of the essence and lives are at stake, and..

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:01.660
It's good stuff.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:02.340
So...

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.300
I know it's a lot to say just for the first episode, but uh...

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.960
It's interesting. Um...

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.380
If I didn't...

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:13.260
I will make- If I didn't have the hype around it, I don't know if I'd be like,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.420
"I HAVE to see the next episode!"

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:16.120
Uh...

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.060
But I do want to see the next episode, out of curiosity.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:20.280
I want to know where it goes.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.440
I like this kid, I like the sister.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.700
He's a little weird.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:24.360
Um...

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.560
I'll just have to see if he gets better.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:27.640
But, um,

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.320
Yeah, so I'll look forward to see where it goes.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.700
Uh, that's episode one. I'll see you for episode two!
