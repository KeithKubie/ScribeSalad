00:00:01.484 --> 00:00:04.995
(dramatic music)

00:00:04.995 --> 00:00:06.128
- [Announcer] From the University

00:00:06.128 --> 00:00:08.943
of California at Berkeley.

00:00:10.461 --> 00:00:13.711
(upbeat fanfare music)

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.860
- Welcome to A Conversation
With History, I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.350
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.827
Our guest is the distinguished

00:00:45.827 --> 00:00:49.220
Japanese writer Kenzaburo Oe.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.790
His prolific body of
novels, short stories,

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.619
and critical and political essays

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:58.350
has won almost every
major international honor.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.440
Oe's achievements as a writer,
committed to both literary

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.660
and humanitarian causes
were recognized in 1994

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.700
when he was awarded the
Nobel Prize for Literature.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.851
In works such as A Personal
Matter, The Silent Cry,

00:01:13.851 --> 00:01:18.031
A Quiet Life, Hiroshima
Notes, and A Healing Family,

00:01:18.031 --> 00:01:21.840
Oe's art moves from the
personal to the political,

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.698
exploring how the individual
in confronting life's tragedies

00:01:25.698 --> 00:01:29.290
overcomes humiliation and shame to,

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.400
in his words, get on with
life, and in so doing,

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.293
finds personal dignity and a renewed sense

00:01:36.293 --> 00:01:39.663
of his responsibility to his fellow man.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.893
Mr Oe, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:42.893 --> 00:01:43.820
- Thank you Harry Kreisler.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.457
- Welcome back to Berkeley, I should say.

00:01:46.457 --> 00:01:51.030
Tell us about where you
were born and grew up.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.990
- I was born in 1935

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.957
in a small island

00:01:55.957 --> 00:01:58.263
of the Japanese archipelago.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.423
Especially, I must emphasize the war

00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:06.870
between USA and Japan

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.700
began when I was six years old.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.700
And then at ten years old,
I saw the war finished.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.097
So my childhood was during the wartime.

00:02:23.097 --> 00:02:24.923
That is a very important thing.

00:02:26.174 --> 00:02:28.324
- Were you the first
writer in your family?

00:02:29.158 --> 00:02:31.293
- This is a very delicate problem.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.730
My family continued to live on,

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.940
almost after two hundred
years or more than that.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.520
There are plenty of
journalists of my ancestors.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.520
So if they wanted to publish,

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.340
I think they could have
been the first writers.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.780
But unfortunately, or fortunately,
they didn't publish it,

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.650
so I am the first man who
published what I write,

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.597
but my mother was always saying that

00:03:16.597 --> 00:03:21.350
you men of our family are

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.820
always writing the same thing.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.820
- (laughs) You have said in an interview,

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.940
The act of trying to remember
and the act of creating

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.255
began to overlap, and that is the reason

00:03:38.255 --> 00:03:41.040
why I began to write novels.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.373
- Yes, and if I add something,

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.760
I begin my writing

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.570
by the method of imagination,

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.570
on the ground of imagination,
and toward the imagination.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:03.530
- What books did you read

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.663
as a young person that you remember?

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.950
- I don't read many books

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.480
before nine years old.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.193
I was fascinated by the

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.170
talking of tales of my grandmother.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.780
She was talking almost
everything about in my family

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.290
or in my district, so

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.253
it was enough for me to,

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.760
I didn't need any books on that time.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.220
But one day, there was some discussion

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.063
between my grandmother and my mother,

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.439
and my mother got up very
early in the morning,

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:55.439
and she packed one kilogram of rice,

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.680
we eat rice,

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.172
and she went to the small city

00:05:05.172 --> 00:05:09.330
of our island over the forest.

00:05:11.301 --> 00:05:16.301
Very late at night she
returned to my village.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.270
She gave a small doll to my sister,

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.830
and some cakes for my younger brother,

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.830
and then she take out two pocket books.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.220
Tome one, tome two.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.723
And I found out Mark
Twain's Huckleberry Finn.

00:05:36.615 --> 00:05:37.640
(Harry laughs)

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.860
I didn't know the name of Mark Twain or

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.070
the name of Tom Sawyer
or Huckleberry Finn,

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.875
but my mother said , and
this was the first talk

00:05:47.875 --> 00:05:51.781
between my mother and I about literature,

00:05:51.781 --> 00:05:54.610
and almost the last talk between us.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:59.497
She said, "This is the
best novel for a child

00:05:59.497 --> 00:06:03.837
"or for an adult, thus your father said."

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.610
The year before my father had passed away.

00:06:11.197 --> 00:06:14.170
"I brought this book for you,"

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:18.167
but the woman who made

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:24.203
the barter with the rice between us said,

00:06:25.807 --> 00:06:29.953
"Be careful, the author is American.

00:06:29.953 --> 00:06:34.733
"Now the war is going on
between USA and Japan.

00:06:35.867 --> 00:06:40.867
"The teacher at school will
take it off from your son.

00:06:41.187 --> 00:06:45.257
"Then if your teacher asks you

00:06:45.257 --> 00:06:48.127
"who is the author,

00:06:48.127 --> 00:06:51.977
"then you must answer Mark Twain

00:06:51.977 --> 00:06:55.105
"is the pseudonym of a German writer."

00:06:55.105 --> 00:06:57.860
(Harry laughing)

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.270
- You also read, according
to your Nobel Prize speech,

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:06.673
a book called The World Adventure of Nils.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:12.400
- Yes, that is a Swedish Author

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:16.153
very famous feminine author,

00:07:17.079 --> 00:07:20.760
Lagerlof, wrote that book,

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.740
but it's a book for the children

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:29.130
of Sweden to study the

00:07:30.693 --> 00:07:34.120
atlas of their country.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.410
So Nils, a kind of trickster

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:43.530
is going through all of the country

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:47.990
on the back of a small geese, goose.

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:50.770
That is also very, very fascinating.

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:55.037
So in my childhood only two books are dear

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:02.050
and also I continued to
read them again and again.

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:06.310
So I always remember all the,

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:09.430
all write of the lines of
the words of those two books.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:12.210
- And one line in particular stood out,

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:16.461
which is this young,
person who rides the geese

00:08:16.461 --> 00:08:18.640
to tour the landscape.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.270
When he comes back he says,

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:21.857
I am a human being again.

00:08:21.857 --> 00:08:25.150
- Yes, yes, he has become

00:08:26.081 --> 00:08:29.080
a very small boy

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:34.080
by some fairy magic

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.900
so he couldn't believe

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.800
in the possibility he becomes an

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:45.843
ordinary sized human being.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.353
He returned to his house,

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:56.963
secretly he comes in the kitchen.

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:00.403
His father finds him.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:08.720
Then some very kind, humane
passion occurs in him,

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:17.460
Then very naturally he grows
to the ordinary man's size.

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:23.603
Then he shouts, oh Mother,
again I am a human being.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.450
That is very important
for me to add, to me.

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:34.450
- You have called yourself
a writer of the periphery.

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:38.940
And in part, you are
referring to your origins

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.200
but you also mean more than that.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.700
Explain what you mean when you say,

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:45.820
I'm a writer from the periphery.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:50.790
- Yes, I believe I am,

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:54.037
I was born in a small island, I said that

00:09:54.037 --> 00:09:58.290
and we are Japan,

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:02.770
Japanese, and our Japan is
on the periphery in Asia.

00:10:05.213 --> 00:10:07.373
That is very important thing.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:09.163
Our very

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.328
eminent colleagues of Japan

00:10:19.328 --> 00:10:22.340
believe in Japan is the center of Asia.

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:26.640
And even they think secretly

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.173
Japan is the center of the world.

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:34.310
So I always say that I am

00:10:35.201 --> 00:10:37.330
the writer of the periphery,

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:41.220
periphery district,
periphery Japan of Asia,

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.850
and periphery country of this planet.

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:47.210
This is I'm, with proud I say it.

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:51.740
Literature must be
written from the periphery

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:55.800
toward the center, and we
can criticize the center.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.560
And also, our credo, or our

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:04.557
theme, or our imagination is that

00:11:05.834 --> 00:11:08.917
of periphery, peripheral human being.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.180
So the man who is in the center

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:18.470
who has not, have nothing
to write, anything.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:20.123
So and from the periphery,

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:26.220
we can write the story of the human being

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:33.300
and this story can express
the humanity of the center.

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:36.967
So I think that,

00:11:39.854 --> 00:11:41.653
when I say the word periphery,

00:11:41.653 --> 00:11:44.993
this is most important creed of mine.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:52.400
- In The Healing Family,
you quote Flannery O'Connor

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:57.661
when she speaks of the novelist's habit,

00:11:57.661 --> 00:11:58.494
- Yes.

00:11:58.494 --> 00:12:01.112
- The accumulated practice.

00:12:01.112 --> 00:12:02.138
- Yes.

00:12:02.138 --> 00:12:03.450
- What is that?

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:06.410
How would you explain to students

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:09.210
what the habits of a writer are?

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:12.640
- Yes, at first, the word habit

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:16.420
is not a good word for artist,

00:12:17.759 --> 00:12:18.663
who are young men.

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:25.253
So I must use the word habit precisely

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:30.303
by the meaning of Flannery O'Connor.

00:12:30.303 --> 00:12:33.080
Flannery O'Connor got that word habit

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:38.080
from her tutor, Jacques
Maritain, I believe.

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:43.350
Jacques Maritain was in
Princeton at that time.

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:48.350
I think Flannery O'Connor
was born, I believe, in 1935,

00:12:50.068 --> 00:12:54.420
and shortly after the
war Flannery O'Connor

00:12:55.739 --> 00:12:57.656
was doing conversations

00:13:00.313 --> 00:13:04.730
through the letters with
her tutor, Jacques Maritain.

00:13:06.403 --> 00:13:07.910
It was Jacques Maritain was writing,

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:12.493
or talking about the
notion of neo-Thomist,

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:17.060
Thomas Aquinas, was a
most important figure

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.632
for Jacques Maritain.

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:24.480
In the notion of Thomas Aquinas,

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.910
via Jacques Maritain, found the word out.

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:33.303
The habit is this,

00:13:33.303 --> 00:13:38.070
when as a writer I
continue to write every day

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:40.500
for 20 years or 30 years

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:45.500
then gradually the habit of
a writer is molded in myself.

00:13:46.587 --> 00:13:48.370
I cannot be conscious about it,

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:51.170
or I cannot be unconscious.

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:56.170
But anyway, I have a habit
to reborn as a writer.

00:13:56.730 --> 00:14:00.513
So if I find out the

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:06.350
crisis that I have never experienced

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:10.640
but on this first crisis,

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:14.030
I can be born, or I can write something,

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:18.390
by the quality, by the power of the habit.

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:21.260
Even some soldier

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:25.910
or a farmer or a fisherman

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:29.920
can reborn by the power of the habit

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:36.030
when he meet the greatest
crisis of his life.

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:41.340
And we human beings is
being born and reborn

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:45.120
and we create our habits as human beings,

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:49.100
then I think we can face their deaths

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:55.080
even though we cannot experienced
it before that, before.

00:14:55.343 --> 00:14:58.850
That must be the notion
of Flannery O'Connor,

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:01.873
and I am a student of Flannery O'Connor.

00:15:03.738 --> 00:15:07.790
- For you it was, the birth of your son

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:13.790
was a turning point in the finding

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:16.326
of your voice as a writer.

00:15:16.326 --> 00:15:17.220
- Yes.

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:21.250
- And in fact, you've written,
twenty-five years ago,

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:23.570
my first son was born with brain damage.

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:25.540
This was a blow, to say the least.

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:28.920
And yet as a writer, I
must acknowledge the fact

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:31.490
that the central theme
of my work throughout

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:34.330
much of my career has
been the way my family

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.723
has managed to live with
this handicapped child.

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:41.843
- Yes precisely, I wrote it.

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:44.323
Yes.

00:15:45.415 --> 00:15:50.093
When I was twenty-eight
years old, I believe

00:15:50.093 --> 00:15:51.426
my son was born.

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:57.440
When I was twenty-eight
years old I am a writer,

00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:01.000
a rather famous writer
on the Japanese scene

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.763
and I was a student, I was a
student of French literature.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.996
And I was talking in the voice

00:16:07.996 --> 00:16:12.760
of Jean-Paul Sartre or Merleau-Ponty.

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:17.760
Then, I was always speaking
about everything of this work.

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:23.940
But when my son was born with
very big damage in his brain,

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:30.200
I found out one night, I
wanted to encourage me,

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:35.800
so I wanted to read my book.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:39.000
That was the first time I read my book,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.187
or the book that was
written on to that date,

00:16:43.187 --> 00:16:47.700
and I found out two days later

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:51.960
I cannot encourage myself through my book.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:55.510
Then anyone can't be
encouraged by my work.

00:16:55.510 --> 00:17:00.510
So I thought, I am nothing
and my book is nothing.

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:04.553
So I am depressed very strongly.

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:08.470
Then I went to,

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:13.470
I was asked by a journalist who is editing

00:17:13.830 --> 00:17:16.970
a political magazine in Japan

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:19.440
and I went to Hiroshima,

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:22.383
the place the atomic bomb was uh.

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:29.020
Then there, on that year,

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:32.810
the peace movement, the anti-atomic bomb

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:39.200
in those assemblies there was big fight

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:44.200
between a Chinese group
and Russian groups.

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:48.180
And I was the only one
independent journalist there,

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:51.720
so I criticized both of them.

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:54.680
And I found out the hospital

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:56.477
of Hiroshima survivors

00:17:59.607 --> 00:18:03.760
and there in the survivors a very great

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.310
Dr. Shigeto I found out.

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:09.910
And with a conversation between Shigeto

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:12.880
and the people who is in the hospital,

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:16.517
gradually I found out there's something

00:18:16.517 --> 00:18:20.970
that encouraged me, so I wanted to follow

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:25.050
this sense that there is something.

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:30.050
So I returned to Tokyo
and I went to the hospital

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:35.220
of my son, and I talked to
his doctors to rescue my son.

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:40.460
Then I began to write about Hiroshima,

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:44.145
then that is a turning point of my life.

00:18:44.145 --> 00:18:47.870
A that was kind of rebirth for myself.

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:52.870
- And so there was an
interplay between what you saw

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:57.310
in the victims of Hiroshima
and also very importantly

00:18:57.310 --> 00:19:00.134
the doctors who were treating the victims,

00:19:00.134 --> 00:19:05.134
that somehow moved you to another level,

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:09.070
or another plane in dealing
with your own personal tragedy?

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:10.130
- Yes.

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:13.960
Yes, and Shigeto said to me,

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.550
we cannot do anything

00:19:18.818 --> 00:19:20.318
for the survivors.

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:27.520
Even today we don't know
anything about the nature

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.713
of the illness of survivors.

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:35.613
And even today, so
shortly after the bombing,

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:43.300
we don't know anything,
but we did what we can do.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:48.280
Every day a thousand people dead.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:52.503
But amidst the dead bodies, I continued.

00:19:53.692 --> 00:19:58.692
So, Kenzaburo, what can I do except that,

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:02.443
when they need our aid?

00:20:02.443 --> 00:20:06.450
Then, now your son needs you.

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:11.090
And you must find out

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:16.090
anyone on this planet doesn't
need you except your son.

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:19.590
Then I understood it.

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:23.250
So I returned to Tokyo and I

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:27.280
began to do something for my son,

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:30.332
and for myself, and for my wife.

00:20:30.332 --> 00:20:34.310
- We should say that your novel about

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:39.401
which involves a protagonist called Bird

00:20:39.401 --> 00:20:43.680
confronting the birth of a child

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.520
is called A Personal Matter,

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:48.210
and your essays on Hiroshima

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:51.414
are collected in a collection
called Hiroshima Notes.

00:20:51.414 --> 00:20:52.290
- Yes.

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:54.170
- Now, I want to read you something

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:58.473
that you say about Dr. Shigeto,

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:04.220
and his colleagues who
were treating the patients.

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:06.120
When the Hiroshima doctors

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:11.120
pursue the A-bomb calamity
in their imaginations,

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:14.903
they are trying to see more
deeply and more clearly

00:21:14.903 --> 00:21:19.710
the depth of the hell into
which they too are caught.

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:24.710
There is a pathos in this dual
concern for self and others,

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.792
yet it only adds to the sincerity

00:21:28.792 --> 00:21:32.380
and the authenticity that we sense.

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:37.380
So that in a way, you
are seeing this duality

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:40.350
in the doctor, you're
saying helped you see

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:44.310
the complexity of the dilemma of Bird,

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:46.003
the protagonist in your novel.

00:21:46.003 --> 00:21:49.720
- Yes, yes.

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:54.080
I think until then my little theme

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:58.450
was a duality or ambiguity of human being

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:00.823
that came from the
existentialism in France.

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:06.070
But I think I found out the true duality

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:11.010
and how I can be so-called
authentic, authentic

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:16.010
but the word authenticity must
not be so liquid in my case,

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:20.670
but I used the word from Jean-Paul Sartre.

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:23.023
Any way, I wanted to be an,

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:26.723
if I say,

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:35.433
today in the other word, that very simple.

00:22:36.845 --> 00:22:40.663
I wanted to say, I wanted to be straight.

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:48.813
I wanted to strictly stand up man.

00:22:50.445 --> 00:22:53.291
Now I cannot remember which are

00:22:53.291 --> 00:22:54.874
the important word.

00:22:58.751 --> 00:22:59.668
Irish poet,

00:23:03.422 --> 00:23:05.197
most important poet.

00:23:05.197 --> 00:23:06.030
- [Harry] Yates

00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:08.197
- Yes, Yeats said straight

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:10.853
in his poem,

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:15.450
he says about the young man

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:19.713
who stands straight,

00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:23.283
straightforwardness.

00:23:24.748 --> 00:23:29.748
This kind of erect quality

00:23:30.752 --> 00:23:33.221
this kind of person,

00:23:33.221 --> 00:23:37.080
this kind of young man

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:39.130
I wanted to be,

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:42.983
but then I used that word authentic.

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:48.070
- Lionel Trilling the critic,

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:51.016
wrote that confessing
to one's true feelings

00:23:51.016 --> 00:23:53.390
was one of the most courageous

00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:56.780
and valuable things a writer could do.

00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:59.620
And that's what you did
in A Personal Matter.

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:00.953
- Yes, I wanted to do so.

00:24:00.953 --> 00:24:04.050
But at the time I don't think about

00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:06.430
the value of a stand up point.

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:12.000
But anyway, I must write about myself.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:12.833
Why not?

00:24:13.741 --> 00:24:16.439
I cannot be reborn

00:24:16.439 --> 00:24:20.610
and my son also can't be reborn, I felt.

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:25.610
So when I was by the sea,

00:24:26.424 --> 00:24:31.424
I must rescue myself and
I must rescue my son.

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:35.643
So I wrote that book, I think.

00:24:35.643 --> 00:24:40.370
- And your son went on
to become a composer.

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:43.560
And tell us a little bit about that,

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:47.249
in other words, your family,

00:24:47.249 --> 00:24:50.440
in caring for him,

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:54.920
your wife, your self, your children,

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:59.210
over time identified an ability

00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:02.120
that he had to communicate.

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:03.557
Tell us how that came out.

00:25:07.239 --> 00:25:11.190
- Until my son is four
years or five years old,

00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:15.953
he doesn't do anything
to communicate with us.

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:21.920
And we thought that he cannot
have any sense of the family.

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:31.163
So he was very, very isolate,

00:25:32.586 --> 00:25:34.602
he looked like very isolated boy,

00:25:34.602 --> 00:25:37.343
like a pebble in the grass.

00:25:39.861 --> 00:25:42.361
But one day, he was interested

00:25:43.313 --> 00:25:46.480
in the voice of a bird from the radio.

00:25:47.832 --> 00:25:51.582
So I bought disks of
the wild birds in Japan.

00:25:53.822 --> 00:25:55.239
And I made a tape

00:25:58.861 --> 00:26:01.194
of 50 specimens of the bird.

00:26:02.133 --> 00:26:03.116
- Bird calls.

00:26:03.116 --> 00:26:03.949
- Bird calls.
- Yeah

00:26:03.949 --> 00:26:08.053
- And there are the bird
calls and a very flat voice,

00:26:09.393 --> 00:26:13.083
a woman announcer, says
the name of the bird.

00:26:13.083 --> 00:26:15.710
Tada-dada, then, nightingale.

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:17.473
Tada-dada, sparrow.

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.870
This is sparrow, this is nightingale.

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:26.870
Then we continued to listen to
that for almost three years.

00:26:29.428 --> 00:26:34.428
And during those three
years, when we played

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:38.300
the bird songs, my son become very quiet.

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:41.740
So it was needed to make him quiet.

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:46.400
My wife must do her work,
and I must do my work.

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:51.400
So with the bird voices we three lived on.

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:55.863
But in the summer when
he was six years old,

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:03.790
I went to our mountain house,

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:08.310
and while my wife was
cleaning our small house,

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.000
I was in the small forest
with my son on my shoulder.

00:27:16.127 --> 00:27:20.213
And nearby there is a small lake.

00:27:23.475 --> 00:27:27.901
A bird sang, a couple of bird,

00:27:27.901 --> 00:27:32.293
bird sang from the couples.

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:37.668
Suddenly a clear, flat voice
said, "It's a water rail."

00:27:37.668 --> 00:27:40.150
(Harry laughs)

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:45.150
Then I shook, utter silence in the forest.

00:27:46.208 --> 00:27:49.230
And so, in five minutes
or so, we are silent

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:55.430
and I prayed for something,
there on my head.

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:03.017
I prayed, that please, the
next voice of that bird

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:07.690
and please next the remarks of my son,

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:10.233
if that was not my phantom or dream.

00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:15.900
Then after five minutes,
the wife of that bird sang.

00:28:17.443 --> 00:28:19.836
Then my son said "It's a water rail."

00:28:19.836 --> 00:28:22.529
(Harry laughs)

00:28:22.529 --> 00:28:24.880
Then I returned to my house

00:28:25.935 --> 00:28:30.720
running with my son and
I talked to my wife.

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:35.410
And for a long time, we
waited for another voice,

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:39.300
but there was not any
voice during the night.

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:42.013
And in the very early morning, we kept,

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:45.600
we didn't sleep.

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:49.760
But a very small sparrow

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:54.700
came on a small tree

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:57.220
in front of our window.

00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:01.490
And he made a small sound,

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:04.249
and my son said, "It's a sparrow."

00:29:04.249 --> 00:29:05.760
(Harry laughs)

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:10.430
Then everything began, and we found out

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:15.210
we played the sound of
a bird, my son answers.

00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:20.490
And we bought many recordings of birds,

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:24.060
even the bird of the USA or Europe.

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:29.060
And my son answered very
quietly and very quickly

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:34.380
if he listened two or
three times the name.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:38.140
Then we

00:29:40.028 --> 00:29:43.633
began to communicate by the word.

00:29:43.633 --> 00:29:48.590
My son is called Pooh-chan,
Pooh from Winnie the Pooh

00:29:50.907 --> 00:29:54.123
Pooh-chan what is the bird?

00:29:54.123 --> 00:29:56.930
And he answers, the sparrow.

00:29:56.930 --> 00:30:00.980
Pooh-chan, what do you want
to listen to the birds?

00:30:02.428 --> 00:30:06.690
Then he thinks, water
rail, or nightingale.

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:08.470
And then we play it.

00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:11.920
Then, we began to communicate,

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:15.410
and my son was accepted

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:19.840
from the school of the mentally retarded.

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:21.200
The boy was retarded.

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.830
And then the teachers,

00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:28.310
very few teachers in the school

00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:31.480
saw they could not take care of my son.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:36.480
So then, they are always
playing FM broadcasts

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:40.270
So they are playing Bach and Handel,

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:45.010
then my son began to listen to the music.

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:50.010
And after he is concerned with the music,

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:55.993
he suddenly he forgot almost
all the voice of the bird,

00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:59.603
voices of it, name of the bird.

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:06.010
Then they began to study the piano,

00:31:06.587 --> 00:31:11.587
and then he continued to listen,

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:15.430
but when he son was sixteen years old

00:31:17.289 --> 00:31:21.767
he had a very strong fit and
he lost the sight of both eyes.

00:31:24.359 --> 00:31:26.776
One of the both eyes can see,

00:31:28.341 --> 00:31:31.424
but through both eyes, he cannot see.

00:31:32.622 --> 00:31:34.740
So he cannot look at the
piano and the musical score.

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:42.410
So he make a missed note,

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:47.000
that is very uncomfortable for him.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.139
So he gave up the piano

00:31:50.139 --> 00:31:55.139
but his mother taught him
how to write the music.

00:31:55.360 --> 00:32:00.360
Then, almost in five weeks,

00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:02.833
he began to write Bach,

00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:08.387
Johann Sebastian Bach, by pencil.

00:32:11.106 --> 00:32:14.943
At first that is very simple music,

00:32:17.812 --> 00:32:22.812
but in a year he began to compose

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:25.643
his music by himself.

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:31.250
- And now he has two CD
discs, which you just said

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:35.410
that you were able to buy on
Telegraph here in Berkeley.

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:40.363
- Yes, eighteen years ago, I was in the

00:32:40.363 --> 00:32:42.576
Women's Faculty Club of Berkeley,

00:32:42.576 --> 00:32:46.450
University of Berkeley,
California, Berkeley.

00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:50.240
There I was very deeply melancholic,

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.824
and I was thinking about my son,

00:32:52.824 --> 00:32:56.993
but now two days ago,

00:32:58.395 --> 00:33:01.470
I was thinking about my
lecture of next Monday.

00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:06.420
I was melancholic, and
I escaped from my room,

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:10.430
I went to the Tower Records
on the Durant Street,

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:15.030
and I bought some discs, CDs,

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.750
by Kiru Sora, or something.

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:22.620
Then I wanted to check.

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:25.650
I don't believe that my son discs,

00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:28.110
but I wanted to check the,

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:32.280
old corner of the
composers, and I found out

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:35.190
two discs of my son, and I bought it,

00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:37.273
and that morning I played it.

00:33:38.602 --> 00:33:41.420
- So your son in a way has

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:44.293
fulfilled the dream of Nils,

00:33:45.578 --> 00:33:50.578
riding on the wings of birds
or, in this case, their sounds

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:53.773
- Yes, yes, so besides the bird,

00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:59.000
besides the big bird, my son can say it.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.170
Yes, I am a human being, I'm a man.

00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:08.170
And besides the discs of my son,

00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:10.460
I thought that I'm man.

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:14.920
- You have written In A Healing
Family that your son's music

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:19.090
has shown you that in the very
act of expressing himself,

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:21.830
that in that act there is a healing power,

00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:24.770
a power to mend the heart.

00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:26.970
And you go on to say, for in the music

00:34:26.970 --> 00:34:30.700
or literature we create,
though we come to know despair,

00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:34.140
that dark night of the soul
through which we have to pass,

00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:37.240
we find that by actually
giving it expression

00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:40.250
we can be healed and know
the joy of recovering.

00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:43.150
And as these linked experiences
of pain and recovery

00:34:43.150 --> 00:34:45.680
are added one to another,
layer upon layer,

00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:47.800
not only is the artist's work enriched,

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.810
but its benefits are shared by others.

00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:55.810
- Yes, if would I add
something to my comment there.

00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:01.980
After writing that essay, I
experienced many questions

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:08.459
to me, and many critic criticized me,

00:35:08.459 --> 00:35:12.346
that Oe has become very conservative now,

00:35:12.346 --> 00:35:14.127
and he is a very quiet man,

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:21.130
and he says, his music healed him

00:35:21.130 --> 00:35:26.130
and he can be healed by the CD of himself.

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:32.420
But that is very negative and
very conservative, they said.

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:35.470
But, I must answer that.

00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:38.470
I don't say to be healed in Japanese.

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:42.420
I think the verb heal

00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:45.214
must be used actively.

00:35:45.214 --> 00:35:50.214
You know, I heal myself, or something.

00:35:50.304 --> 00:35:52.900
A human being is healed by something.

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:57.170
That is a very positive
deed of human beings.

00:35:57.170 --> 00:36:01.410
So when I listen to the music of my son,

00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:05.250
I don't experience any passive deed.

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:12.233
I feel I am doing something
positive with my son.

00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:16.700
We are looking at the same direction.

00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:21.700
So if someone feels he is
healed by the music of my son,

00:36:22.617 --> 00:36:27.617
even then I believe someone, unknown man,

00:36:27.644 --> 00:36:31.950
is looking at the same
direction with my son.

00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:36.683
So he is positively healing
himself with my son.

00:36:36.683 --> 00:36:39.930
- So that your son is, in his own way,

00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:42.920
getting on with his life, as you say.

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:47.440
and the example can inspire others,

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:50.720
help them get on with their lives,

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:52.580
and heal themselves in the process.

00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:57.310
- Yes, precisely, so I
want to do the same thing.

00:36:57.310 --> 00:37:00.700
My son's music is a
model of my literature.

00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:02.133
I want to do the same thing.

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:10.030
- Do you believe that a
writer chooses his themes

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.270
or do they come upon him?

00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:16.880
- Oh, yes, I think,

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:20.540
Nadine Gordimer once has written

00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:23.800
that we don't choose a theme

00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:29.860
or a situation or story or everything,

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:35.963
that a theme, it choose us.

00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:41.460
That is the goal of the
writer, in some time,

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:47.760
The time, the days choose us as a writer.

00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:51.293
So we must respond to our time.

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:58.840
So I think, from my experience I can say

00:37:59.518 --> 00:38:03.090
the same thing with Nadine Gordimer.

00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:07.887
I didn't choose the story
of a handicapped son,

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:13.423
or we didn't choose the theme
of a handicapped boy's family.

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:18.020
I wanted to escape from
that if it were possible,

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:22.360
but something choosed
me to write about it.

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:24.710
Or my son choosed me.

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:29.710
That is only one definite
reason I continue to write.

00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:38.070
- You go on to say in another
essay, the fundamental style

00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:42.360
of my writing has been to
start from my personal matters

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:47.360
and then link it up with
society, the state and the world.

00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:52.907
- Yes, I think I am doing

00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:59.810
my works to combine, to
link myself, or my family,

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:07.120
with the society, with the
cosmos, the whole world.

00:39:07.809 --> 00:39:12.629
So link me with me, with my family,

00:39:12.629 --> 00:39:15.123
link my family to the cosmos,

00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:21.460
that is easy, because
all of the literature

00:39:22.451 --> 00:39:25.390
has some mystic tendency.

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:28.231
So when we write about our family,

00:39:28.231 --> 00:39:32.880
we can link ourselves to
the cosmos, our cosmos.

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:37.880
But I wanted to link myself
and my family with society.

00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:44.970
So when we link ourselves to the society

00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:50.660
then we don't write very personal matter

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:54.173
but we are writing the independent novel.

00:39:55.125 --> 00:40:00.125
- You say in The Healing
Family that the lessons

00:40:00.970 --> 00:40:05.970
that you learned in
making a handicapped child

00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:09.590
an active part of your family

00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:15.810
was an example, in a way,
that teaches the individual

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:20.940
how society at large should
treat the handicapped,

00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:24.940
and that society, in
essence, one can create

00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:29.410
a healing society through
having a healing family.

00:40:29.410 --> 00:40:34.300
- Yes, I hope so, but I don't

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:37.610
want to emphasize the role of the family

00:40:37.610 --> 00:40:39.880
of the handicapped boy.

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:43.403
I don't want to emphasize individuality.

00:40:45.107 --> 00:40:50.107
Always, when we linked with society,

00:40:50.229 --> 00:40:52.062
our individual family,

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:58.310
has the value, social value.

00:40:58.310 --> 00:41:03.310
So, if not, I think, we can only write

00:41:04.575 --> 00:41:08.242
very personal matter
through our experience.

00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:15.070
When I named my first novel about my son

00:41:16.466 --> 00:41:20.049
A Personal Matter, that I believe

00:41:20.049 --> 00:41:25.023
I knew the the most important thing.

00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:28.350
There is not any personal matter.

00:41:28.350 --> 00:41:33.350
We must find out a strong
pipe between ourselves,

00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:36.730
and to the society.

00:41:36.730 --> 00:41:40.470
- SO what role should the writer play

00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:42.760
in the politics of his time?

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:47.340
- Yes, to combine our
service to the society,

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:50.163
that is politics, that is my opinion.

00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:56.190
I don't need any role as a policymaker.

00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:01.140
There are some friends of mine

00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:02.760
who have become the policymaker.

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:06.113
- You don't want to be
Henry Kissinger. (laughs)

00:42:07.170 --> 00:42:10.520
- I was in a seminar with Mr. Kissinger.

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:15.520
But Mr. Kissinger said
in the bye bye party,

00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:19.437
with a very famous,

00:42:24.748 --> 00:42:25.581
what is it?

00:42:25.581 --> 00:42:28.930
Malicious smile, or something

00:42:30.727 --> 00:42:35.230
The very wicked rabbit makes a smile

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:40.337
in the cartoons, like
this, wicked smile, yes.

00:42:40.337 --> 00:42:43.103
"Mr. Oe's wicked smile,"
Mr. Kissinger said.

00:42:44.832 --> 00:42:49.832
But I am not a wicked person, but

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.050
against the policymaker,

00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:56.340
sometimes I make a wicked smile.

00:42:56.340 --> 00:43:01.160
But I am not a man with a
policy, or doing the politics.

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:04.380
But from the real life of human being,

00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:08.430
I want to do something for the politics.

00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:13.430
So I must do something through
my literature or my essays.

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:16.843
- And what is that?

00:43:18.618 --> 00:43:22.140
- Right now I'm actually, I personally

00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:25.950
I believe I can say in my very small voice

00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:27.277
now I am doing that.

00:43:27.277 --> 00:43:29.944
(both laughing)

00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:36.360
- What does a Japanese writer need to add

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:40.420
to the discourse in Japan,
given what has appeared

00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:45.420
to be an emphasis on materialism,
and a lack of values,

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:48.700
which you have discussed
in some of your essays.

00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:52.720
- Yes, I continually criticize

00:43:56.819 --> 00:43:58.290
Japanese people's attitude in Asia,

00:43:58.290 --> 00:44:01.009
and throughout the whole of the world.

00:44:01.009 --> 00:44:02.759
Before the economical

00:44:07.192 --> 00:44:08.859
supply or economical

00:44:14.410 --> 00:44:16.540
great situation in Japan.

00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:20.608
Before, even when we are poor

00:44:20.608 --> 00:44:24.820
I began to criticize our attitude to Asia,

00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:27.206
or to the all of the world.

00:44:27.206 --> 00:44:29.289
And during the very, very

00:44:34.606 --> 00:44:38.844
prosperity of economics
of Japan, I continued.

00:44:38.844 --> 00:44:43.844
After that, now our crisis, we
are in a crisis of economics,

00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:47.740
and I must continue that.

00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:50.283
I think, in Japan,

00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:55.323
we wanted to create a truly new

00:45:00.930 --> 00:45:05.037
national attitude after
our defeat of the war.

00:45:07.033 --> 00:45:09.177
For years, we wanted to do that

00:45:09.177 --> 00:45:14.177
and we wanted to create
a democratic country,

00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:18.083
democracy, democratic man,

00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:22.113
but I think we gave it up.

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:25.430
Fifty years passed now.

00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:30.430
There is an atmosphere of
anti-democracy in Japan.

00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:36.370
So they don't say that, today, not yet

00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:41.863
they say ultranationalism must be,

00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:48.263
must come back to Japan, but
I feel it very ambiguous.

00:45:54.188 --> 00:45:59.188
Give the dangerous
atmosphere of nationalism

00:46:02.010 --> 00:46:04.750
is coming in our society.

00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:09.750
So now I want to criticize
about this tendency,

00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:15.230
and I want to do everything
to prevent the development

00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:19.870
of fascism in Japanese society.

00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:24.870
- Do you think that your
novels and the humane themes

00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:31.790
that you focus on contribute

00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:36.070
to the climate of ideas

00:46:36.070 --> 00:46:39.513
so that fascism becomes
less of a possibility?

00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:45.630
- Well, I think when I was
in Hiroshima, doctor said,

00:46:48.237 --> 00:46:53.010
"When you cannot do anything,
you must do something."

00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:57.423
So I think if I can

00:46:59.730 --> 00:47:02.883
have some power to influence

00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:07.383
the young intellectuals,

00:47:07.383 --> 00:47:11.440
I think we can organize
some, a different power.

00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:16.440
Because today's crisis
is unconscious feeling

00:47:16.643 --> 00:47:21.328
of some ultranationalism in Japan.

00:47:21.328 --> 00:47:26.328
A very big feeling, atmosphere.

00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:31.720
So we must, if we write
about it precisely,

00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:32.733
and if we attack it, then I think

00:47:32.733 --> 00:47:37.733
Japanese young intellectuals

00:47:39.830 --> 00:47:43.220
can become conscious about this feeling.

00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:48.220
It is very important in the
beginning, so I want to do it.

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:51.590
- So in a way, these intellectuals

00:47:51.590 --> 00:47:56.410
might confront these issues and help shape

00:47:56.410 --> 00:47:58.640
the public debate in the way that,

00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:02.490
in A Personal Matter, Bird confronts

00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:04.650
the reality that he has to confront.

00:48:04.650 --> 00:48:09.650
- Yes, so I want to
ask young men of Japan,

00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:14.843
or young intellectuals, please
confront to your reality.

00:48:17.429 --> 00:48:20.490
- A theme that I've noticed in several

00:48:20.490 --> 00:48:24.350
of your books was a focus on youth.

00:48:24.350 --> 00:48:28.310
Nip the Buds talks about a youth gang

00:48:28.310 --> 00:48:29.910
where there are no values

00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:32.660
and the town has evacuated, and so on.

00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:35.600
What special role do young people

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:38.550
have to play not just intellectuals,

00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:43.050
in shaping our ideas about the world?

00:48:43.050 --> 00:48:44.987
- Well yes, now that

00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:51.193
I finished my novel,

00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:57.160
and in the end of my
novel, my hero is creating

00:48:57.420 --> 00:49:02.170
a new charity, that is not
Christian, not Buddhist,

00:49:02.170 --> 00:49:04.710
but only they are doing something

00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:08.423
for the soul of him, of
the assembled young men.

00:49:10.854 --> 00:49:15.500
The leader, one day read a Bible

00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:18.600
in front of the people, Ephesians,

00:49:20.070 --> 00:49:22.100
the letter of Ephesians.

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:25.923
And in Ephesians there
are two words, new man.

00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:31.800
Jesus Christ has become
a new man on the cross.

00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:36.320
We must take off the
old coat of the old man.

00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:37.240
We must wear a new one.

00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:42.240
So only the new man can do something,

00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:46.932
so you must become a new man.

00:49:46.932 --> 00:49:51.932
My hero hasn't any real
program about the future,

00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:58.690
but he believes that we must
create a human, a new man.

00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:02.530
And the young man must become new man.

00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:04.170
Old man must mediate

00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:08.060
to create new man.

00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:10.420
So, that is my creed.

00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:15.420
So, I'm always thinking
about youth's role in Japan.

00:50:16.490 --> 00:50:19.630
- How would you recommend that students

00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:23.020
who might see this interview,
prepare for the future?

00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:25.100
First, how to prepare to be a writer?

00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:29.490
And secondly to have the
kind of positive influence

00:50:29.490 --> 00:50:32.093
in defining a new man
that you just mentioned?

00:50:32.970 --> 00:50:34.403
- Yes, I want,

00:50:37.610 --> 00:50:40.880
at first, I hope the young man is

00:50:44.178 --> 00:50:47.320
uprighted, yes, and independent.

00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:48.200
- Like Bird?

00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:53.200
- Yes, and also, and secondly
I hope they have imagination.

00:50:54.550 --> 00:50:59.550
The imagination is not the power
to accept the other's image

00:51:01.357 --> 00:51:04.183
but to create our own image,

00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:08.070
and also more precisely

00:51:08.070 --> 00:51:13.020
to reform the imagination
which was given to us.

00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:18.020
So to be upright and
to have an imagination,

00:51:20.770 --> 00:51:25.770
it's enough to be a very good young man.

00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:29.840
- You have a quote, if I can find it

00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:34.840
when you speak of Dr. Shigeto,

00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:40.080
and if can leave you to comment on this.

00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:43.012
You say of Dr. Shigeto, you write,

00:51:43.012 --> 00:51:47.610
without too much hope or too much despair,

00:51:47.610 --> 00:51:52.370
he had simply dealt with the
suffering as best he could,

00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:56.090
and then you go on to say, he
was truly an authentic man.

00:51:56.090 --> 00:51:59.340
- Yes yes, so my professor

00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:02.553
was a specialist of French Humanism,

00:52:02.553 --> 00:52:06.413
and he always said to
me "What is Humanism?

00:52:06.413 --> 00:52:10.547
"It is to be without too much hope

00:52:12.657 --> 00:52:15.420
"and also too much (speaking
foreign language)",

00:52:18.408 --> 00:52:19.560
what is the English word?

00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:21.410
- Despair, despair.
- Despair, yes.

00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:24.520
Not too much despair, not too much hope.

00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:29.520
That is the model type
of a humanist today.

00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:34.600
That was my teacher's
comment, and I said that

00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:37.427
to Mr. Shigeto, and Shigeto said,

00:52:37.427 --> 00:52:40.057
"Yes, I know that through my life."

00:52:41.010 --> 00:52:44.780
- Thank you very much Mr.
Oe for joining us today

00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:47.670
and sharing reflections on your work,

00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:50.610
and welcome back to Berkeley,
and we hope you come again.

00:52:50.610 --> 00:52:54.810
- Thank you very much, you
are authentic with questions.

00:52:54.810 --> 00:52:55.643
- Thank you.

00:52:55.643 --> 00:52:57.277
And thank you very much for joining us

00:52:57.277 --> 00:53:00.313
for this Conversation with History.

00:53:04.551 --> 00:53:07.801
(upbeat fanfare music)
