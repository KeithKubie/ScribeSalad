00:00:02.221 --> 00:00:05.700
 LinkedIn is the social network most commonly used by professionals 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.166
 We're always among the best apps on Google Play 

00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:10.740
 I am Bradypta Dash 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.230
 I am the Director of Engineering at LinkedIn 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.030
 And its leading applications 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.030
 We got over a million comments 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.760
 We always get 4 stars or higher 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.690
 Our users appreciate the stability of the application 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.833
 And its role in highlighting the strengths of their professional portfolio 

00:00:26.916 --> 00:00:28.610
 I'm Drew Hani 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.720
 I work on LinkedIn's core Android architecture team 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.920
 My team is responsible for Android app performance 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.970
 We are responsible for the app versions on Google Play 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.820
 And on testing the application or building designs 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.240
 One of the tools that excited my team 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.730
 Is an APK parser tool 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.950
 Because we spend most of the time monitoring the size of the app 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.410
 Some experience was required 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.110
 To see what determines the size of the application 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.360
 But with the APK parser tool available 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.160
 We were able to increase the knowledge of the team as a whole 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.330
 Linkdein was one of the pioneers in the adoption of Gradle 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.600
 The Gradle adoption in Android was very convenient for us 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.960
 Because we share a lot of plug-ins that we've released 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.580
 We can get consistent versions across software development machines and version service 

00:01:15.615 --> 00:01:18.170
 We especially benefited from the Lint system 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.380
 Which contains a lot of integrated tests for common problems 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.830
 We really appreciate our ability 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.640
 To write and customize Lint tests 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.780
 For LinkedIn specific internal libraries 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.060
 Many developers are checking code base 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.990
 One of the things that facilitates the admission of a new person 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.070
 The pattern of symbols is constant across each code base 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.680
 Android Studio lets us select a custom icon style 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.440
 Each software developer can add it 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.995
 And automatically get code format with LinkedIn style 

00:01:44.235 --> 00:01:45.530
 And one of the things we also benefit from 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.203
 Is that this Statute is open 

00:01:47.203 --> 00:01:50.400
 Where comments can not be accepted only 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.170
 Which was given to the developer forum 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.120
 But can also be acted upon 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.750
 My team became over the past two years 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.230
 Much faster, and more flexible 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.040
 Making it easier and faster to encode in Android Studio.
