thinking it's to step back and look at

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320
thinking it's to step back and look at

this look at the problem not the

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670
this look at the problem not the
 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.490
this look at the problem not the
solution and then you'll realize that

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500
solution and then you'll realize that
 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.290
solution and then you'll realize that
you had some hidden assumption or some

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300
you had some hidden assumption or some
 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.730
you had some hidden assumption or some
assumption that you could relax that you

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740
assumption that you could relax that you
 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.800
assumption that you could relax that you
didn't realize and that will change

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810
didn't realize and that will change

everything for example here's a riddle

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680
everything for example here's a riddle
 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.790
everything for example here's a riddle
Marjorie and Margie were born of the

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800
Marjorie and Margie were born of the
 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.100
Marjorie and Margie were born of the
same mother and father on the same day

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.110
same mother and father on the same day
 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.880
same mother and father on the same day
of the same month at the same hour and

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890
of the same month at the same hour and
 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.400
of the same month at the same hour and
yet they are not twins how is that

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410
yet they are not twins how is that
 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.840
yet they are not twins how is that
possible so these two girls were born at

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850
possible so these two girls were born at
 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.250
possible so these two girls were born at
the same time the same parents but

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260
the same time the same parents but
 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.619
the same time the same parents but
they're not twins well the answer is

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629
they're not twins well the answer is
 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:46.959
they're not twins well the answer is
they're triplets

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969
they're triplets
 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.729
they're triplets
now you could you could start reasoning

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739
now you could you could start reasoning
 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.110
now you could you could start reasoning
you're not going to get there because

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120
you're not going to get there because
 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.329
you're not going to get there because
you have an assumption implicit

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:53.339
you have an assumption implicit
 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:54.470
you have an assumption implicit
assumption that you're making of a

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480
assumption that you're making of a
 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.790
assumption that you're making of a
picture in your mind that's why the

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800
picture in your mind that's why the
 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.279
picture in your mind that's why the
riddle is tough I say Marge Marjorie and

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289
riddle is tough I say Marge Marjorie and
 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.889
riddle is tough I say Marge Marjorie and
Margie you picturing two girls or two

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899
Margie you picturing two girls or two
 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.930
Margie you picturing two girls or two
women once you have that picture in your

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940
women once you have that picture in your
 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.329
women once you have that picture in your
mind you're excluding the answer which

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339
mind you're excluding the answer which
 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.490
mind you're excluding the answer which
is triplets or quadruplets or something

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500
is triplets or quadruplets or something
 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.100
is triplets or quadruplets or something
else like that and that's that happens

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110
else like that and that's that happens
 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.770
else like that and that's that happens
in life too that sometimes the answer is

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780
in life too that sometimes the answer is
 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.630
in life too that sometimes the answer is
easy once you question your assumptions

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640
easy once you question your assumptions
 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.590
easy once you question your assumptions
