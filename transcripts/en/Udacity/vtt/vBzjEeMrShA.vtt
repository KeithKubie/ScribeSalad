00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:00.910
Hey Charles.

00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:02.029
&gt;&gt; Hey Michael, how's it going?

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:03.150
&gt;&gt; Not too bad.

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.800
I'm very excited because today we
get to talk about TD with Control.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.190
&gt;&gt; Okay,
is that what that yellow thing is?

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:10.630
&gt;&gt; That's intended to
be a lightning bolt.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.500
I don't know, somehow it just
convergence, TD with Control,

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.230
it sounded like a superhero movie to me.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:16.030
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.360
That makes perfect sense.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.450
Why are you excited about this?

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.017
&gt;&gt; Well so, what we are going to talk
about is how to not just learn values

00:00:22.017 --> 00:00:25.461
learning update rules like TD, but
to actually learn the values of

00:00:25.461 --> 00:00:29.780
different actions we might take as a way
of figuring out the right way to behave.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:30.528
&gt;&gt; Okay.
I like that.

00:00:30.528 --> 00:00:31.137
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
And

00:00:31.137 --> 00:00:35.647
we'll even get really close to
proving that these methods converge.

00:00:35.647 --> 00:00:38.578
That is to say that,
given enough data over enough time,

00:00:38.578 --> 00:00:40.570
they actually do the right thing.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:41.150
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.560
By the way, did you know
that Convergence is the name

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.390
of the 2015 company-wide
event in DC Comics?

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.950
&gt;&gt; Whoa!

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.570
Okay, so it is a superhero thing.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:51.740
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well done.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.450
&gt;&gt; Does that mean we get paid for
using their stuff, or

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.930
does that mean that we have to pay for
using their stuff?

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.310
&gt;&gt; I think it means that
we have to pay them so-

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.320
&gt;&gt; Oh, whoops.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.080
&gt;&gt; Time to raise tuition.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:04.780
&gt;&gt; Can I do that?

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.570
&gt;&gt; There you go,
now everything's taken care of.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.070
&gt;&gt; Tada!
