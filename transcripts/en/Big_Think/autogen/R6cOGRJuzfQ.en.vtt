I would give him is to put more folks
 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.160

like architects in charge of some major
problems that are out there I think that

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390
problems that are out there I think that
 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.030
problems that are out there I think that
we can actually reify them visually show

what those solutions might be in many
different camps I certainly wouldn't put

different camps I certainly wouldn't put
 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.920
different camps I certainly wouldn't put
us in charge of the military but I think

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930
us in charge of the military but I think
 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.370
us in charge of the military but I think
we can help retool Detroit a lot better

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380
we can help retool Detroit a lot better
 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.190
we can help retool Detroit a lot better
than the folks there and I think that

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200
than the folks there and I think that
 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.500
than the folks there and I think that
we're were fitted to accept that there

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510
we're were fitted to accept that there
 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.380
we're were fitted to accept that there
was a talk before the you know before

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390
was a talk before the you know before
 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.650
was a talk before the you know before
this happened between the McCain camp

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660
this happened between the McCain camp
 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.020
this happened between the McCain camp
and the obama camp about what they

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030
and the obama camp about what they
 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.510
and the obama camp about what they
should be promoting in their in their

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520
should be promoting in their in their
 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.900
should be promoting in their in their
elections and there I guess the big

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910
elections and there I guess the big
 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.290
elections and there I guess the big
issue was Detroit and thinking about

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300
issue was Detroit and thinking about
 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.830
issue was Detroit and thinking about
what we can do to save Detroit and I had

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840
what we can do to save Detroit and I had
 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.690
what we can do to save Detroit and I had
two separate answers for that I think

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700
two separate answers for that I think
 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:09.950
two separate answers for that I think
for the McCain camp it would be the

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960
for the McCain camp it would be the
 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.990

military can save Detroit and there's

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000
military can save Detroit and there's
 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.090
military can save Detroit and there's
some serious reasons why and for the

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100
some serious reasons why and for the
 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.710
some serious reasons why and for the
obama camp there's going to be you know

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720
obama camp there's going to be you know
 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.110
obama camp there's going to be you know
science and innovation maybe and put

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120
science and innovation maybe and put
 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.210
science and innovation maybe and put
some big thinkers in architecture

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220
some big thinkers in architecture
 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.090
some big thinkers in architecture
involved in retooling Detroit but for

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100
involved in retooling Detroit but for
 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.680
involved in retooling Detroit but for
the McCain camp if you think about it

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690
the McCain camp if you think about it
 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.360

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370
getting to an all electric
 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.780
getting to an all electric
infrastructure an all-electric mobile

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790
infrastructure an all-electric mobile
 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.000
infrastructure an all-electric mobile
infrastructure would take something like

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010
infrastructure would take something like
 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.220
infrastructure would take something like
the military to do it because DARPA and

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230
the military to do it because DARPA and
 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.190

those folks in the military could make a
 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.170
those folks in the military could make a
decision like that and that decision

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180
decision like that and that decision
 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.840
decision like that and that decision
would be let's make tanks run on

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850
would be let's make tanks run on
 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.150
would be let's make tanks run on
electric drives let's make jeeps run

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160
electric drives let's make jeeps run
 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.560
electric drives let's make jeeps run
electric drives and let's do that

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570
electric drives and let's do that
 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.440
electric drives and let's do that
because those engines have almost no

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450
because those engines have almost no
 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.620
because those engines have almost no
moving parts so they're very easy to fix

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630
moving parts so they're very easy to fix
 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.540

very easily come out of the Jeep and put
it into a helicopter and they're hard to

section of the battery power all the

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970
section of the battery power all the
 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.969
section of the battery power all the
power isn't destroyed it's distributed

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979
power isn't destroyed it's distributed
 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.440
power isn't destroyed it's distributed
throughout the vehicle so it actually

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450
throughout the vehicle so it actually
 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.150
throughout the vehicle so it actually
makes a more robust
