00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.880
about five years ago grant showed you a
cool design how to build a frame for a

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.840
MEGA Solar Scorcher
now this frame worked really well

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.340
especially on a budget. I'm pretty sure
the whole thing cost about $10 to

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:13.240
assemble so that was pretty good. But
over the years this thing has taken a

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:20.200
lot of wear and tear to the point where
now it can't even hold itself up anymore.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.699
That's why it's leaning up against the
workbench right now. Combining that with

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.230
the fact that our lens is covered with
marks and scratches and debris and a

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.920
bunch of smoke from so many things that
it's burned; it's time to build a new one

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.309
and upgrade the design a little bit.
We've got a new lens and we've got

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.430
materials for a frame and this design is
going to be based a little bit on our

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.930
Desktop Solar Scorcher which I think
will provide a little bit more sturdy of

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.110
a structure once it's complete. The first
step is going to be isolating the

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.100
Fresnel lens itself so we don't have the
obnoxious frame or any other layers of

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.550
plastic that may be attached to it

00:00:52.550 --> 00:01:02.250
there's the part we want. We now have
the frame and just this spare piece of

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.740
plastic that was in front of the Fresnel
lens protecting it maybe we'll use that

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.790
for something. At this point I think we
can discard this frame unless we want to

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.720
just use it for posing. After isolating
the Fresnel lens the first step is going

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.909
to be to build a frame just around the
lens portion of it previously, Grant used

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.270
2x4s ripped in half to build
the frame around the lens I'm going to

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.990
base my design on that and I will use a
2x4 ripped in half for the top and

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.650
bottom of the lens but for the size I'm
going to use 2x4s with their

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.250
complete width because I think that will
add some more strength to the hinge

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.930
mechanism this lens is 41 inches wide by
31 inches tall let's build our frame to

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.850
match that

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.730
I'll leave three quarters of an inch
space on the long sides of our Fresnel

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.690
lens because that's where the wider part
of the frame is going to attach so for

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.399
the top and bottom we'll cut off two
pieces of the half 2x4 and then cut a

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:15.420
groove down that so it fits nicely on
the lens. Now these two pieces that we've

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.920
cut and added a groove to should
perfectly house the ends of our Fresnel

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.650
ends our. 2x4 is about the width that I
want but I want it to have a nice square

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.330
edge so I've got the table saw set to
just barely wide enough to cut off that

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.750
curved edge and then it should meet up
nicely without losing too much of the

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.400
width. Now that we have our two-by-four
with the square rift edge we can measure

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.990
exactly how long we want it to be to
line up just perfectly with the ends

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.470
that we've already cut.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.370
Excellent, now just like we did it with
the top and bottom of the frame we need

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.510
to add a groove that cuts three-quarters
of an inch down into the middle of our

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.760
2x4s. We've now got all four
sides of our frame cut let's see how

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:11.780
well they fit together. The hinge on this
frame is going to have a long bolt that

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.520
runs through most of the side frame and
then through the to supporting pieces

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.590
that hold the frame up we'll need to
drill two holes into our 2x4 one that's

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.010
wide enough that the head of the bolt
can fit and one that's slightly narrower

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.760
but wide enough for this piece of tubing
we're going to have some spacers between the

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.980
frame and each of the legs but even with
that we should be able to fit a fair

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.170
amount of the bolt inside our 2x4 this
is the depth that we want the wider hole

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:46.150
cut and then our narrower hole will go
all the way through the 2x4 from there

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:57.830
do that same thing on our other
2x4

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.330
the larger first hole we drilled should
accommodate the head of our bolt we now

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.830
need to drill the smaller hole that will
accommodate the copper pipe that our

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.880
bolt will run through

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:15.810
we did most of our drilling with our
drill press but it doesn't have quite a

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.350
deep enough plunge to get all the way
through this 2x4 so to finish it off

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.380
we've put the bit into the hand drill
and we'll just be finishing the drill

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.120
hole with that we've measured off the
length that we need to perfectly fill

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.630
this hole let's cut that off with a
hacksaw and then push it down into the

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:36.300
wood dropping this bolt down through I'm
hoping that this will let it pivot

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.590
nicely without the bolt wearing down on
the wood do the same thing for the other

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:48.870
side excellent as a last step before I
assemble the four pieces of the frame

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.800
around the Fresnel lens I want to add a
router edge just to make it a little bit

00:04:52.800 --> 00:05:00.310
nicer and cleaner looking

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.990
the screws I'm going to be using aren't
long enough to reach all the way through

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.979
a 2x4 into the other piece of wood so
I'll drill a larger hole to about here

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:20.569
one inch in and then I'll pre-drill the
rest of the 2x4 as well as the side

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:24.669
piece of wood before attaching the screw

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.360
the frame that holds the Fresnel lens is
now assembled so it's time to add the

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.550
four legs on to our MEGA Solar Scorcher
I've got these 1x3 planks of

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.410
wood I'm going to use four of them as
the feet there will be two on each side

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:48.020
instead of them being next to each other
like they were before they'll actually

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.069
be overlapping each other with the hinge
running through the middle let's measure

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:55.340
the lengths we want these legs to be cut
them off of that length and then drill

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.580
the holes where we want our hinge to go
now that's where we're going to have the

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.240
hinge go let's add another inch and a
half on top of that just to make sure

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:08.640
it's a nice sturdy connection fifty nine
and a half inches will be where we'll

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.140
cut our boards

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.630
each of these four boards now needs its
own small section of pipe to act as a

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:24.930
hinge

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:36.000
all four of our legs have been cut to
length drilled and had their own section

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.540
of hinge pipe added so we should be able
to thread these on to the bolts and have

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.110
some feet we don't want just the wood
flush up against the wood there will be

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.950
too much friction as we try and open and
close it or swing our frame so let's add

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:57.510
some nylon washers to make our hinge
turn a little bit more easily to add a

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:01.560
bit more strength and so that we have a
spot where we can lay down a board to

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.190
focus our solar scorcher on whatever
we're trying to burn let's add two

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:09.990
supports on each of these legs going
down the sides I've got some 1x2

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:14.340
board and that's what we use for our
side supports unlike on the last solar

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:18.750
scorcher these supports won't go in
between the two legs one set of supports

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:22.440
will go on top of one pair of legs and
the other set of sports will go on the

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.190
other side of the other pair of legs
that way it should still be able to

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:36.100
collapse down all the way flat the way
it's laying right now

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.820
our side supports are trimmed to the
right length and we've smoothed down all

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.820
the edges using the router now we'll use
a couple of screws on each side to

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:49.810
really attach them in place our frame
holds itself up it has two supports on

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:53.800
the bottom and by tightening or
loosening these wing nuts on the side we

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:58.090
can actually hold the frame in place to
help make it easier to carry this mega

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:01.690
solar scorcher I've got a couple of gate
handles I'm gonna attach those to the

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:12.610
outside legs on both sides with our
handles attached there's one more

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:15.190
addition I want to make and that's
something that we have on the mini solar

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:19.960
scorcher and that's the Sun pointing
screws we'll add a screw on to the top

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:24.250
and bottom of our lens that should be
perfectly perpendicular to the direction

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:28.240
that the lens is facing which means we
can use the shadow of the screw to know

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.700
when the lens is perfectly lined up with
the Sun

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:55.310
fantastic, I love this drill press,
everything about it

00:08:55.310 --> 00:09:00.529
Based on the design of the mini solar
scorcher here is the mega scorcher 2.0

00:09:00.529 --> 00:09:05.660
we're using the same style of giant fern
L lens but a sturdier design for the

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:10.279
frame itself so it should be a lot
easier to position to carry around and

00:09:10.279 --> 00:09:16.339
to just have it stay working well for a
long time the hinge works very nicely

00:09:16.339 --> 00:09:20.870
and very smoothly and as you can see
it's really well balanced anywhere that

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:25.220
I put it it just stops right there and
then if I want to make it a little bit

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:29.059
more sturdy so it really can't turn I
can tighten the wing nuts on the side

00:09:29.059 --> 00:09:32.240
and that adds a lot more resistance to
twisting it

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.660
our pointers at the top and bottom
should work really well for aiming our

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:39.559
screen directly at the Sun which should
help us get just the right amount to

00:09:39.559 --> 00:09:43.519
focus when we're trying to burn
something hey guys there's still more to

00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:46.879
see that little box up at the top will
transport you directly to our last video

00:09:46.879 --> 00:09:50.029
click the little box down there it'll
take you to what YouTube thinks you

00:09:50.029 --> 00:09:53.180
should be watching next and if you hit
the bomb here in the middle you'll be

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:56.209
subscribed to the channel so you'll
never miss another video don't forget to

00:09:56.209 --> 00:10:02.440
ring the bell and we'll see you in the
next one talk to you then.
