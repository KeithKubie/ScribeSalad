in the alley in the back,

00:00:05.705 --> 00:00:07.907
and they were standing there
like, "Cut his ear off!

00:00:07.907 --> 00:00:09.876
Cut his ear off,
Dashonthany!"

00:00:09.876 --> 00:00:11.911

- I relate to Ari because
he was gonna be a rabbi,

00:01:18.477 --> 00:01:21.314
and I was a--
I actually was a minister.

00:01:21.314 --> 00:01:23.015
I was a Jehovah's Witness.

00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:24.650
And, uh, I was born into it.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.652
Is anybody raised
religious in here?

00:01:26.652 --> 00:01:28.855
This is two different
stories, by the way,

00:01:28.855 --> 00:01:30.322
that connect
in a very weird way.

00:01:30.322 --> 00:01:31.524

of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.366
Oh, they don't like us.

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:42.101
You know why?
I used to live down south.

00:01:42.101 --> 00:01:44.303
They didn't like me because
I didn't believe in hell.

00:01:44.303 --> 00:01:46.773
Like, why would you get
mad at me for that?

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:48.374
Well, people hear it
and they're like,

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:49.676
"Oh, you can't
do your birthdays?"

00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:51.444

I don't know, Prince?

Those are the two things...

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.615
It's not well-known.

00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:57.316
It's just a regular
doomsday cult.

00:01:57.316 --> 00:01:59.652
It's no bid deal.
Um...

00:01:59.652 --> 00:02:02.488
But I'm not bitter against it,
and I, you know--

00:02:02.488 --> 00:02:04.690
I kind of
appreciate it, you know,

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.660
because it really taught
me how to lie, you know?

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.194
Like...

00:02:09.194 --> 00:02:11.830
If you're raised religious,
that's what it really gives you:

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.502
the life skill of, like,
who to lie to and when and why.

00:02:16.502 --> 00:02:18.738
Like, you...
you can't get that

00:02:18.738 --> 00:02:19.972
from a secular education.

00:02:19.972 --> 00:02:24.377
You need, like,
higher stakes, you know?

00:02:24.377 --> 00:02:28.714
To really act like your life
depends on it, you know?

00:02:28.714 --> 00:02:32.217
'Cause your immortality
fucking depends on it, so...

00:02:32.217 --> 00:02:34.720
that's when you really learn.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.888
Right?

00:02:35.888 --> 00:02:37.256
It's a valuable
skill to have.

00:02:37.256 --> 00:02:38.690
I'm sure you got it
in spades, right?

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.593
You were like--
were you one of them, like,

00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:41.660
[babbling] those guys?

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.028
Yeah.

00:02:43.028 --> 00:02:44.897
So that's the--
you see how you learn?

00:02:44.897 --> 00:02:48.434
At first you tell yourself that
this is "God's language."

00:02:48.434 --> 00:02:49.835
[laughter]

00:02:49.835 --> 00:02:53.238
That--you tell yourself that,
and that's reality.

00:02:53.238 --> 00:02:54.941
So other lies come
easy once you know

00:02:54.941 --> 00:02:57.010
how to do that
magic, right?

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.577
And you get, like,
a secret life.

00:02:58.577 --> 00:03:00.713
And, you know, when
religious people go bad,

00:03:00.713 --> 00:03:02.848
everyone jumps on them,
'cause you think you're not

00:03:02.848 --> 00:03:04.917
supposed to sin, but they're
really just doing shit

00:03:04.917 --> 00:03:07.286
everybody does, it's just
they built it up so much,

00:03:07.286 --> 00:03:08.688
that they're not
that kind of person.

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:10.557
So that's why it's so
devastating.

00:03:10.557 --> 00:03:12.424
You're in your head,
you're like, "I'm not a guy

00:03:12.424 --> 00:03:13.726
that does things like this."

00:03:13.726 --> 00:03:14.894
Right?

00:03:14.894 --> 00:03:16.695
So when I grew up out
of the church I was in,

00:03:16.695 --> 00:03:19.698
I realized everybody was
doing, like, soap opera, epic...

00:03:19.698 --> 00:03:21.934
just fucking--
all kinds of crazy shit

00:03:21.934 --> 00:03:23.535
that I had no
idea as a kid--

00:03:23.535 --> 00:03:26.972
like, I'm the sucker that
followed it, I felt like.

00:03:26.972 --> 00:03:28.307
'Cause I really did, you know?

00:03:28.307 --> 00:03:29.776
Like, I was raised--

00:03:29.776 --> 00:03:32.211
I was told never to
masturbate, ever.

00:03:32.211 --> 00:03:33.646
Like,<i>that</i>religious.

00:03:33.646 --> 00:03:37.049
Like, an adult said,
"You should never...never--

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:41.454
if all goes perfectly, you
will have never masturbated."

00:03:41.454 --> 00:03:43.623
An adult with a straight
face said that to me.

00:03:43.623 --> 00:03:46.259
And, uh--yeah, you know what
happened, by the way,

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:47.593
to a grown man?

00:03:47.593 --> 00:03:52.064
Just medically,
if he never masturbated?

00:03:52.064 --> 00:03:53.299
No.
Nobody knows.

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:54.767
It's never been
attempted by anyone,

00:03:54.767 --> 00:03:58.904
but I'm supposed to be
the first man in history

00:03:58.904 --> 00:04:02.608
to not jerk my dick off.

00:04:02.608 --> 00:04:05.811
Like, "Kurt, we think you
could be the chosen one, so...

00:04:05.811 --> 00:04:09.849
We've all--
we've all failed."

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.351
You know?

00:04:12.351 --> 00:04:15.021
Yeah, but it's that
kind of stuff, right?

00:04:15.021 --> 00:04:17.022
And, uh, so,
but ours was a espe--

00:04:17.022 --> 00:04:19.458
like, what's especially
hard about Jehovah's Witnesses

00:04:19.458 --> 00:04:21.861
was, uh--or why people might
think it's cult-y is,

00:04:21.861 --> 00:04:23.663
you have to do it, okay?

00:04:23.663 --> 00:04:26.499
That's what made the hardest
part about the religion.

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:28.333
It's not like--
like, Catholics, I always envy.

00:04:28.333 --> 00:04:30.035
'Cause that's, like, so great.

00:04:30.035 --> 00:04:32.004
You just get to be Catholic.
You don't have to do nothing.

00:04:32.004 --> 00:04:34.340
Right?
What're you gonna do?

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.541
You watch, like,
mafia movies.

00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:37.309
You never see them
take the guy...

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:39.645
"Hey, uh, Mr. Soprano, don't
come to this church no more

00:04:39.645 --> 00:04:41.347
because you're a murderer."

00:04:41.347 --> 00:04:43.015
You don't--they don't say that.
It's cool.

00:04:43.015 --> 00:04:45.885
We had to do ours, or you get
disfellowshipped, right?

00:04:45.885 --> 00:04:47.553
Which is, like, cast out.

00:04:47.553 --> 00:04:48.887
And all your friends are
in the congregation.

00:04:48.887 --> 00:04:50.656
They set it--
It's set up that way.

00:04:50.656 --> 00:04:52.858
Your real friends are in your--
are Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:04:52.858 --> 00:04:54.393
The rest of you are
nice, like we could

00:04:54.393 --> 00:04:55.861
be acquaintances, but...

00:04:55.861 --> 00:04:57.496
you know, God's
gonna exterminate you

00:04:57.496 --> 00:04:59.165
off this earth, so...

00:04:59.165 --> 00:05:00.900
Don't get too attached.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.635
[laughs]

00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:05.905
You seem like nice
people, but you know.

00:05:05.905 --> 00:05:07.239
We didn't have hell, though.

00:05:07.239 --> 00:05:08.974
But it was still all--
everything on you.

00:05:08.974 --> 00:05:10.843
So people would have
secret lives, right?

00:05:10.843 --> 00:05:14.046
So this is the first--this is
about a sex crime, this story.

00:05:14.046 --> 00:05:15.214
And, uh...

00:05:15.214 --> 00:05:17.149
Yeah.
Yeah.

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:21.854
When I was eight, my brother was
born and my mom's best friend

00:05:21.854 --> 00:05:24.723
in the church,
her son babysat me.

00:05:24.723 --> 00:05:27.393
He was 13, okay?
We'll call him "Josh."

00:05:27.393 --> 00:05:29.996
And, uh, he was like--
he was like an adult to me,

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:31.831
'cause I was eight, you know?
This 13-year-old.

00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:33.332
When I think back on that,
it's funny,

00:05:33.332 --> 00:05:35.101
'cause he was
like really skinny.

00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:37.403
It's the '80s, so he's got
like a Luke Skywalker

00:05:37.403 --> 00:05:39.105
butt cut kind of hair.
Right?

00:05:39.105 --> 00:05:42.575
And he's--Jeffrey Dahmer glasses
that everybody had.

00:05:42.575 --> 00:05:46.212
And, uh, real skinny, but like
really high shorts, okay?

00:05:46.212 --> 00:05:48.881
And, uh, so he--I was just
alone with him the whole day.

00:05:48.881 --> 00:05:51.416
And, uh, he didn't molest me or
something, we just had to watch

00:05:51.416 --> 00:05:53.218
"The Honeymooners,"
which I didn't care for.

00:05:53.218 --> 00:05:56.389
'Cause I was eight.
That's not the sex crime.

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:58.791
That--it went fine.
We just spent the day together.

00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:00.092
[laughter]

00:06:00.092 --> 00:06:02.194
He was a nice church boy.
It wasn't anything.

00:06:02.194 --> 00:06:05.731
Um...so, but a few years later,
when he got to high school,

00:06:05.731 --> 00:06:08.434
he started working
out a lot, this guy.

00:06:08.434 --> 00:06:09.702
And, uh, but just his top.

00:06:09.702 --> 00:06:11.270
He was one of those
dudes, right?

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.940
And it was before people really
started calling you on that,

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.474
so he really...

00:06:15.474 --> 00:06:17.409
Yeah, I mean, he did ster--
I don't know if he just

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:19.612
shot the steroids on the
top part like that.

00:06:19.612 --> 00:06:21.113
I don't know what he did.

00:06:21.113 --> 00:06:23.115
But he...just gigantic--

00:06:23.115 --> 00:06:26.919
but the same legs I remember
from 13 and the same hair,

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:29.722
but it was just smaller
on his big steroid head now.

00:06:29.722 --> 00:06:31.256
[laughter]

00:06:31.256 --> 00:06:33.892
But he was a hulking man now.

00:06:33.892 --> 00:06:34.894
He was, like, 17.

00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:36.462
And, uh...yeah,
everybody was like,

00:06:36.462 --> 00:06:37.796
"Jesus, Josh is huge."

00:06:37.796 --> 00:06:39.665
Like, real--
it was very impressive, right?

00:06:39.665 --> 00:06:42.067
And, uh, then,
even more impressive,

00:06:42.067 --> 00:06:46.138
he ended up banging
his geometry teacher.

00:06:46.138 --> 00:06:47.306
[laughter]

00:06:47.306 --> 00:06:48.941
Yeah.

00:06:48.941 --> 00:06:52.645
His geometry teacher, uh...
I guess statutory raped him.

00:06:52.645 --> 00:06:54.146
[laughs]

00:06:54.146 --> 00:06:56.148
And they didn't really
charge you back then.

00:06:56.148 --> 00:06:57.783
You know?

00:06:57.783 --> 00:06:59.285
They just handled
it at the school.

00:06:59.285 --> 00:07:01.320
She got fired, and uh...

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.156
She got divorced, and then,
uh, it was a big scandal.

00:07:04.156 --> 00:07:07.793
'Cause I heard about it through
the Jehovah Witness grapevine.

00:07:07.793 --> 00:07:10.329
Right?
That was the--the gossip.

00:07:10.329 --> 00:07:13.032
And, uh--so the developments
were amazing when they come in.

00:07:13.032 --> 00:07:15.467
But then the most amazing
development was

00:07:15.467 --> 00:07:17.203
she decided she wanted
to study the Bible

00:07:17.203 --> 00:07:18.971
with Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:07:18.971 --> 00:07:21.474
So, they have to let you.

00:07:21.474 --> 00:07:23.042
So guess what?

00:07:23.042 --> 00:07:25.177
She started coming
to the church, and uh--

00:07:25.177 --> 00:07:27.146
you know, Josh's mom
wasn't too thrilled,

00:07:27.146 --> 00:07:28.381
but what's she gonna do?

00:07:28.381 --> 00:07:29.615
She can't say
nothing about it.

00:07:29.615 --> 00:07:32.451
And, uh,
then they got married.

00:07:32.451 --> 00:07:34.120
She studied--this was
over a four year period.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.855
She became a Jehovah's Witness
and they married

00:07:36.855 --> 00:07:39.024
and became a nice
Christian couple.

00:07:39.024 --> 00:07:40.626
She was real hot, too.

00:07:40.626 --> 00:07:43.329
She was like a real--before even
the word "MILF" was a thing,

00:07:43.329 --> 00:07:45.898
like she was that
and she was, like...

00:07:45.898 --> 00:07:48.234
Like, it was the sisters
of the congregation that were,

00:07:48.234 --> 00:07:49.701
like, giving her
the side-eye.

00:07:49.701 --> 00:07:51.237
The brothers, like,
"That kid's awesome."

00:07:51.237 --> 00:07:54.874
Like, first of all,
he's got a great upper body.

00:07:54.874 --> 00:07:57.542
Start with that.

00:07:57.542 --> 00:08:01.079
Had the same haircut
for over eight years.

00:08:01.079 --> 00:08:03.049
You know, it wasn't
as much of a thing for--

00:08:03.049 --> 00:08:04.516
I remember my dad, like...

00:08:04.516 --> 00:08:07.219
And, uh, yeah.
So that's the end of that.

00:08:07.219 --> 00:08:11.089
That sex crime just ended with
a nice church couple, basically.

00:08:11.089 --> 00:08:14.260
A little May-December romance.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.563
Uh, and then--so then,
this is the second story,

00:08:17.563 --> 00:08:19.898
which, for some reason
that I don't understand,

00:08:19.898 --> 00:08:23.035
relates to that story
and it shouldn't.

00:08:23.035 --> 00:08:25.604
But, uh, when I got--I was,
like, 19, and I got out

00:08:25.604 --> 00:08:27.740
of high school and I wanted to--
I didn't go to college,

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.841
I wanted to, like, have
a job for some reason first.

00:08:29.841 --> 00:08:32.878
And, uh, I worked at the this
place called Funcoland.

00:08:32.878 --> 00:08:34.447
Which is a...
they sell videogames.

00:08:34.447 --> 00:08:36.181
It's called GameSpot now.

00:08:36.181 --> 00:08:38.751
I don't know why I looked at
you like you would know, dude.

00:08:38.751 --> 00:08:40.119
[laughs]

00:08:40.119 --> 00:08:43.456
This backyard wrestler
understands what I'm saying.

00:08:43.456 --> 00:08:46.925
It's a video game store.
[laughter]

00:08:46.925 --> 00:08:48.227
Okay.

00:08:48.227 --> 00:08:52.631
And, uh, I got hired as
assistant manager right away

00:08:52.631 --> 00:08:54.967
by this guy, uh, Ricardo,
let's call him.

00:08:54.967 --> 00:08:57.937
He was this Puerto Rican guy
who was 30 when I was 19.

00:08:57.937 --> 00:08:59.872
And he was, uh--
he was also a Jehovah's Witness

00:08:59.872 --> 00:09:02.274
from the Spanish
congregation, okay?

00:09:02.274 --> 00:09:04.876
And, uh, but he just, like--
we just got along.

00:09:04.876 --> 00:09:06.945
So he hired me as
assistant manager.

00:09:06.945 --> 00:09:08.948
And I was kind of
a jerk off, you know?

00:09:08.948 --> 00:09:11.450
But uh, he had a violent temper,
and would yell at me

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:13.552
until I did the job good.

00:09:13.552 --> 00:09:14.887
And, uh--

00:09:14.887 --> 00:09:16.589
and he was, like,
really light-skinned,

00:09:16.589 --> 00:09:18.657
blue-eyed Puerto Rican guy
from the islands,

00:09:18.657 --> 00:09:20.626
so he looked down
on anybody from here.

00:09:20.626 --> 00:09:22.261
I don't know if you know
the politics of that.

00:09:22.261 --> 00:09:25.398
Of, like, Puerto Ricans
versus other Puerto Rican

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:27.166
kind of people,
but it's intense.

00:09:27.166 --> 00:09:28.734
And, uh...

00:09:28.734 --> 00:09:30.503
but he would, like, call me
"white boy" a lot,

00:09:30.503 --> 00:09:32.471
but he was like very white,
you know?

00:09:32.471 --> 00:09:33.906
And, uh--

00:09:33.906 --> 00:09:35.608
and we would play fighting
games and he would

00:09:35.608 --> 00:09:38.644
break his controllers 'cause he
thought I was being too cheap.

00:09:38.644 --> 00:09:40.679
He goes,
"You cheap me out, man!

00:09:40.679 --> 00:09:42.013
Why don't you be a man?"

00:09:42.013 --> 00:09:44.650
And he'd break his controller.
[laughs]

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.119
He broke, like, three
controllers.

00:09:47.119 --> 00:09:51.457
Talking like Mandy Patinkin from
"The Princess Bride" to me.

00:09:51.457 --> 00:09:53.358
"You killed my father!"

00:09:53.358 --> 00:09:54.827
So...

00:09:54.827 --> 00:09:56.995
But he did really man me up.
I got to give it to him.

00:09:56.995 --> 00:09:59.498
And I--he ended up getting
fired for something,

00:09:59.498 --> 00:10:01.434
but I became the manager
and he had trained me.

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:06.038
So now, I'm like 20, and I'm
the manager of Funcoland.

00:10:06.038 --> 00:10:10.175
And, uh, I live at my parent's
and I make $24,000 a year,

00:10:10.175 --> 00:10:12.144
so that's pretty awesome,
you know?

00:10:12.144 --> 00:10:15.514
And, uh, I had to hire an
assistant manager.

00:10:15.514 --> 00:10:17.883
And, uh, the guy
that I hired--

00:10:17.883 --> 00:10:19.852
uh, I interviewed a
whole bunch of people,

00:10:19.852 --> 00:10:21.653
and, you know, retail--
with a job like that,

00:10:21.653 --> 00:10:23.188
you just want to find
someone you can

00:10:23.188 --> 00:10:24.523
hang out with, right?

00:10:24.523 --> 00:10:26.158
That's really your main--

00:10:26.158 --> 00:10:29.528
They won't steal
too much and--you know?

00:10:29.528 --> 00:10:32.164
That's all you're looking for,
'cause it's a nightmare.

00:10:32.164 --> 00:10:33.566
You know how retail is?

00:10:33.566 --> 00:10:36.869
Like, that just--that, you know,
you have that store greeting.

00:10:36.869 --> 00:10:39.905
"Great day at Funcoland!"
You have to say that.

00:10:39.905 --> 00:10:43.042
Like, they think
people want that.

00:10:43.042 --> 00:10:46.044
And then they have snitches
that call to make sure

00:10:46.044 --> 00:10:47.813
you're telling people
you're having

00:10:47.813 --> 00:10:49.648
a great fucking
day at Funco.

00:10:49.648 --> 00:10:52.551
"I'm having a great day!"

00:10:52.551 --> 00:10:54.920
"Yes, great leader!"

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.322
So, but because I was
religious, I was good at

00:10:57.322 --> 00:10:59.158
that kind of sh--
that stuff, you know?

00:10:59.158 --> 00:11:02.762
Little stupid rules for no
reason that you have to follow.

00:11:02.762 --> 00:11:05.264
And I had training
from the Bible.

00:11:05.264 --> 00:11:07.666
[laughter]

00:11:07.666 --> 00:11:10.369
So I hired this guy,
he was from Philly.

00:11:10.369 --> 00:11:11.904
This black guy from Philly.

00:11:11.904 --> 00:11:13.372
And, uh, he was
older than me, too,

00:11:13.372 --> 00:11:15.074
and he was like--
he was just the first guy

00:11:15.074 --> 00:11:18.077
that I just, like, got along
with really well, okay?

00:11:18.077 --> 00:11:19.945
And he was, like,
pretty 'hood.

00:11:19.945 --> 00:11:21.681
From like--

00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:23.615
and, you know, now I live
in a straight-up ghetto,

00:11:23.615 --> 00:11:26.452
so it's not new to me now,
but if you're from the suburbs,

00:11:26.452 --> 00:11:28.720
and have no--you know,
you have maybe black friends

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.756
if you're white,
but they're not, like,

00:11:30.756 --> 00:11:32.791
what you imagine from TV,
right?

00:11:32.791 --> 00:11:37.362
This is, like--this is the
TV coming to work for me.

00:11:37.362 --> 00:11:40.599
You know? It's not all, like,
guys with the sideways gun,

00:11:40.599 --> 00:11:42.101
there's levels of it.

00:11:42.101 --> 00:11:43.735
There's, like--
there's hustler guys and like...

00:11:43.735 --> 00:11:46.104
there's white-collar
of that shit.

00:11:46.104 --> 00:11:48.474
So he was that.
He was a smarter dude.

00:11:48.474 --> 00:11:50.042
So, uh...

00:11:50.042 --> 00:11:52.711
yeah, he had been a--
like, an enforcer

00:11:52.711 --> 00:11:54.480
for this crack
dealer in Philly.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.114
[laughter]

00:11:56.114 --> 00:11:57.749
Like, he had to go--
he told me he had to,

00:11:57.749 --> 00:11:58.918
like, get people.

00:11:58.918 --> 00:12:00.619
And, uh...
[laughs]

00:12:00.619 --> 00:12:02.988
Yeah, and I think it's this
chick that I saw on "Gangland."

00:12:02.988 --> 00:12:04.723
I just put it
together recently.

00:12:04.723 --> 00:12:07.125
Called the "Queen Pin," 'cause
I'm like, it's a female,

00:12:07.125 --> 00:12:09.628
it's--the timeline works.
I think that's who it was.

00:12:09.628 --> 00:12:12.130
Now looking back.
Um...

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:14.666
Yeah, so like, if you owed
like a small amount of money,

00:12:14.666 --> 00:12:17.470
he would come just mess you up.
and, uh--'cause you have to.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.805
That's how that economy--
you can't let that go.

00:12:19.805 --> 00:12:21.740
You know?
You'll be dead.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.776
You have to send this--

00:12:23.776 --> 00:12:25.577
send, uh,
let's call him Dashonthany.

00:12:25.577 --> 00:12:27.646
You have to send Dashonthany.

00:12:27.646 --> 00:12:31.984
Let's just mix all the names
together: Dashonthany.

00:12:31.984 --> 00:12:33.251
Um...

00:12:33.251 --> 00:12:37.289
But he had been a
violin prodigy, okay?

00:12:37.289 --> 00:12:39.091
And I swear to God,
this is the story.

00:12:39.091 --> 00:12:41.927
He was a violin prodigy that
tested out of dum-dum school

00:12:41.927 --> 00:12:44.095
that he was in, and they put
him in a arts high school,

00:12:44.095 --> 00:12:46.999
'cause he was like some
kind of mega IQ guy

00:12:46.999 --> 00:12:49.001
and he just hung out
with bad people

00:12:49.001 --> 00:12:50.969
and just dropped
out of that school

00:12:50.969 --> 00:12:53.305
and became a
crack enforcer.

00:12:53.305 --> 00:12:56.509
And, uh, he told me he had--
the reason he moved was

00:12:56.509 --> 00:12:59.011
he was going after this
one guy who was real big,

00:12:59.011 --> 00:13:01.279
and he got kind of close to the
guy, and the guy just hit him

00:13:01.279 --> 00:13:04.116
without warning, and, like,
cracked his rib or something.

00:13:04.116 --> 00:13:06.018
And he said, like,
he felt like crying.

00:13:06.018 --> 00:13:08.821
He's like, "Yeah actually, fuck
it. I cried a little bit."

00:13:08.821 --> 00:13:11.957
And then, uh--and then he
ran up and like kicked

00:13:11.957 --> 00:13:15.027
this dude in the chest
and the guy didn't get up.

00:13:15.027 --> 00:13:18.564
So he moved to my town
to work for me at Funcoland.

00:13:18.564 --> 00:13:21.700
[laughter]

00:13:22.834 --> 00:13:24.302
Yeah, that--
all of this I learned

00:13:24.302 --> 00:13:26.238
in the interview,
by the way.

00:13:26.238 --> 00:13:27.473
Did I mention that?

00:13:27.473 --> 00:13:30.876
This was all told during
the interview process.

00:13:30.876 --> 00:13:32.478
I mean, it was riveting.

00:13:32.478 --> 00:13:34.046
You know,
he's like a Netflix series.

00:13:34.046 --> 00:13:35.647
I was like,
"You're hired right now."

00:13:35.647 --> 00:13:37.082
[laughter]

00:13:37.082 --> 00:13:40.052
So it was, like, awesome
to hang out with this dude.

00:13:40.052 --> 00:13:42.888
And, uh, he's into like
martial arts and stuff,

00:13:42.888 --> 00:13:44.890
so he would, like--
we would go to like flea markets

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:46.558
and buy, like...

00:13:46.558 --> 00:13:47.893
It's like hanging out with
Wesley Snipes or something.

00:13:47.893 --> 00:13:50.195
We would buy karate weapons.

00:13:50.195 --> 00:13:53.532
Impractical karate weapons
that you would never use.

00:13:53.532 --> 00:13:55.334
And he would show me how
to play with them and,

00:13:55.334 --> 00:13:58.370
like, all kinds of stuff
that--I'm not supposed to do

00:13:58.370 --> 00:13:59.938
none of this stuff,
'cause I'm a Jehovah's Witness.

00:13:59.938 --> 00:14:02.074
I can't play with violent...

00:14:02.074 --> 00:14:04.109
I couldn't even have
guns on my "Star Wars" men.

00:14:04.109 --> 00:14:07.512
My mom took the guns
off my "Star Wars" men.

00:14:07.512 --> 00:14:10.249
So I just had men.

00:14:10.249 --> 00:14:12.518
Thanks for the men!

00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:14.853
[laughter]

00:14:14.853 --> 00:14:18.757
So finally someone's
giving me some man time!

00:14:18.757 --> 00:14:20.459
So...uh, yeah.

00:14:20.459 --> 00:14:23.294
So he, uh--some, partway--
he was a great employee.

00:14:23.294 --> 00:14:25.797
He was like sell all
the commissionable stuff

00:14:25.797 --> 00:14:27.966
really fast
and the customers loved him

00:14:27.966 --> 00:14:29.868
'cause he was a charming dude.
He was great.

00:14:29.868 --> 00:14:31.370
And, uh, he was
very, like, supportive.

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:33.472
Like, he was always
building up my self-esteem.

00:14:33.472 --> 00:14:35.207
[laughter]

00:14:35.207 --> 00:14:36.742
[laughs]

00:14:36.742 --> 00:14:39.778
And, uh, later I worked in
Jersey City and these guys--

00:14:39.778 --> 00:14:42.114
I ended up getting in a fight
with some people and I thought

00:14:42.114 --> 00:14:43.948
they were gonna kill me
'cause that's a bad area

00:14:43.948 --> 00:14:46.985
and he drove up
with a gun to just watch me.

00:14:46.985 --> 00:14:50.388
Like, he was down.
He was a down dude.

00:14:50.388 --> 00:14:53.124
So, he started
selling crack on the side

00:14:53.124 --> 00:14:56.161
to supplement
his Funcoland income, okay?

00:14:56.161 --> 00:14:57.996
It was Bricktown, New Jersey,
so he was, like,

00:14:57.996 --> 00:14:59.631
the only game in town.

00:14:59.631 --> 00:15:03.769
And, uh, now he had an enforcer
who was called "Zumo," okay?

00:15:03.769 --> 00:15:06.137
I hadn't--
I'd never met him.

00:15:06.137 --> 00:15:08.774
But just imagine hearing
that name, Zumo.

00:15:08.774 --> 00:15:12.144
And he would
complain about Zumo.

00:15:12.144 --> 00:15:14.279
[laughs]

00:15:14.279 --> 00:15:16.181
He was like,
"Zumo smokes too much products

00:15:16.181 --> 00:15:18.984
and he's too violent."
Okay?

00:15:18.984 --> 00:15:20.686
He almost beat
this guy to death.

00:15:20.686 --> 00:15:22.687
Like, 'cause he wasn't
like a gangster in his head.

00:15:22.687 --> 00:15:25.123
He was like, "I'm in Bricktown,
it's just a little side...

00:15:25.123 --> 00:15:27.159
I just sell crack
to friends, man."

00:15:27.159 --> 00:15:28.460
[laughs]

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:31.196
He wasn't, like, you know,
starting an empire.

00:15:31.196 --> 00:15:33.799
And meanwhile,
Zumo is like some maniac,

00:15:33.799 --> 00:15:35.334
but you always have
a new, terrible--

00:15:35.334 --> 00:15:39.137
and this guy, Dashonthany,
had done some shit himself.

00:15:39.137 --> 00:15:42.507
Like, he told me he cut
a guy's ear off once.

00:15:42.507 --> 00:15:44.142
Somebody had robbed him.

00:15:44.142 --> 00:15:45.611
Like, he got mugged and didn't
know he was connected to

00:15:45.611 --> 00:15:49.148
this lady, so his boys
found the guy at a club

00:15:49.148 --> 00:15:51.049
and called them over there
and he was on his knees

00:15:51.049 --> 00:15:52.684
in the alley in the back
and they're standing around

00:15:52.684 --> 00:15:54.053
like, "Cut his ear off!"

00:15:54.053 --> 00:15:55.687
"Cut his ear off,
Dashonthany!"

00:15:55.687 --> 00:15:57.122
[laughter]

00:15:57.122 --> 00:15:59.458
And, uh, and he--
we were putting games away

00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:01.660
while he was telling me,
and he goes--and he goes,

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:03.695
"Yeah, man, I didn't want
to do it, but, you know,

00:16:03.695 --> 00:16:06.465
"they were all yelling, so...

00:16:06.465 --> 00:16:09.068
I was just like, 'fuck it man,'
I cut his ear off."

00:16:09.068 --> 00:16:13.338
Right? I was putting away
"Bubsy 2" for Sega Genesis.

00:16:13.338 --> 00:16:16.741
On the wall--
As I remember the happy char--

00:16:16.741 --> 00:16:19.878
[mumbles indistinctly]

00:16:19.878 --> 00:16:22.147
But it was just fascinating
and I, you know,

00:16:22.147 --> 00:16:24.049
I'm a church kid,
so that's amazing to me,

00:16:24.049 --> 00:16:25.550
just anything like that.

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:28.253
So l loved hanging out with him,
but I was always, like,

00:16:28.253 --> 00:16:31.556
"What if, you know...
Moses were alive and saw--"

00:16:31.556 --> 00:16:34.392
Like, just some weird Bible-y
shit they put in your head.

00:16:34.392 --> 00:16:36.862
They told us to imagine Bible
characters are watching you.

00:16:36.862 --> 00:16:38.730
So I'm like,
"What if Moses saw?"

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:41.400
[laughter]

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:42.934
But I'm not supposed
to be hanging out

00:16:42.934 --> 00:16:44.169
with this person, okay?

00:16:44.169 --> 00:16:46.204
At all.
Like, a friend like that, okay?

00:16:46.204 --> 00:16:48.073
He's not one of us
and he sells crack

00:16:48.073 --> 00:16:49.775
and he has a Zumo
working for him.

00:16:49.775 --> 00:16:51.343
[laughter]

00:16:51.343 --> 00:16:54.245
I could get disfellowshipped
if somebody found out.

00:16:54.245 --> 00:16:56.849
That's where you're,
like, out of the thing.

00:16:56.849 --> 00:16:59.618
That's like a disconnecting
or whatever, right?

00:16:59.618 --> 00:17:02.387
And, uh, so I'm at his house,
we're playing with

00:17:02.387 --> 00:17:05.089
butterfly knives
that we bought

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:06.591
and he's showing me
how to do all the cool--

00:17:06.591 --> 00:17:08.594
I know how to do all them--
I could do all of them

00:17:08.594 --> 00:17:11.230
'cause he, this guy showed me
and, uh, while I'm doing that,

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:12.964
I hear:
bang bang bang bang bang!

00:17:12.964 --> 00:17:14.366
On his door.
Like a violent--

00:17:14.366 --> 00:17:16.301
I felt like someone
was coming to get me

00:17:16.301 --> 00:17:18.303
in trouble
for not playing.

00:17:18.303 --> 00:17:21.206
Like, it was a such
a nerve-racking sound.

00:17:21.206 --> 00:17:25.210
And, uh, he goes,
"Ah, man, Zumo's here."

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:27.278
I'm like, "Oh, shit."

00:17:27.278 --> 00:17:30.415
Now I'm in too deep 'cause--

00:17:30.415 --> 00:17:33.919
I'd like to just hang out with
him without ever--you know?

00:17:33.919 --> 00:17:36.755
And, uh, so door
opens up and, uh...

00:17:36.755 --> 00:17:39.791
It's fucking Josh,
the guy that babysat me

00:17:39.791 --> 00:17:40.959
and fucked his teacher.

00:17:40.959 --> 00:17:43.328
[laughter]

00:17:43.328 --> 00:17:47.299
Uh...in addition to
already an impressive resume--

00:17:47.299 --> 00:17:48.433
[laughter]

00:17:48.433 --> 00:17:51.469
[laughs]

00:17:51.469 --> 00:17:54.506
By nights he controls
the streets as Zumo.

00:17:54.506 --> 00:17:56.441
[cheers and applause]

00:17:56.441 --> 00:17:58.910
Yeah.

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:00.479
I, uh, couldn't
believe it.

00:18:00.479 --> 00:18:02.814
We were both like,
"Man, what're you doing here?"

00:18:02.814 --> 00:18:05.284
[laughs]

00:18:05.284 --> 00:18:07.653
Yeah, and then,
uh, him and that--

00:18:07.653 --> 00:18:09.521
that teacher
ended up getting divorced,

00:18:09.521 --> 00:18:10.989
'cause he's a crackhead. 
That's the end of it.

00:18:10.989 --> 00:18:13.091
All right, that's my story.
Thanks.

00:18:13.091 --> 00:18:14.126
[cheers and applause]
