00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.710
Derrick what do you think about this?

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:04.190
&gt;&gt; So what we talked about before was

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.700
that the bottom layer
is the hardware layer.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.340
I'm not completely sure what
the hardware of Watson looks like but

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.610
I assume there has to be a physical
computer there somewhere.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.455
At the next layer, the algorithm layer,
Watson has some general searching and

00:00:17.455 --> 00:00:21.830
decision-making ability that allows him
to search over his knowledge base and

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:22.950
come to decisions.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.750
These are general abilities that
are separated from whatever

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.880
individual thing he's trying
to think about right now.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.390
And then at the top layer we
can think about exactly that,

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.900
what he's trying to
think about right now.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.510
So the task here might be
answering the inputted clue.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.010
This would involve searching on
the individual information in the clue,

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.830
processing his knowledge
specifically about that data,

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.300
and then coming to an answer
specifically for that clue.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.489
&gt;&gt; That was a good answer David.

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:54.450
So the again the three layers and
note that in the task layer here,

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.670
answering the inputted clue,
knowledge is also a part of it.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.720
Knowledge that Watson must
have in order to be able to

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.379
answer that particular question,
how that knowledge is implemented,

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.280
what kind of presentations it
uses goes in the second layer.
