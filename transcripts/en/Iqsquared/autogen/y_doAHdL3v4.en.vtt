00:30:32.159 --> 00:30:32.169
unintended consequences and in fact you
 

00:30:32.169 --> 00:30:34.379
unintended consequences and in fact you
know you say when the Telegraph first

unintended consequences and I think
that's going to be true even in the case

so we need a new approach and

01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:02.170
so we need a new approach and
 

01:05:02.170 --> 01:05:03.840
so we need a new approach and
interestingly enough quantum mechanics

01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:03.850
interestingly enough quantum mechanics
 

01:05:03.850 --> 01:05:06.240
interestingly enough quantum mechanics
does give us at least a theory and we

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:06.250
does give us at least a theory and we
 

01:05:06.250 --> 01:05:08.490
does give us at least a theory and we
are well on way a well on our way to

01:05:08.490 --> 01:05:08.500
are well on way a well on our way to
 

01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:12.030
are well on way a well on our way to
bring the math the physics and the

01:05:12.030 --> 01:05:12.040
bring the math the physics and the
 

01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:13.620
bring the math the physics and the
computer science because all the

computer science because all the
 

01:05:13.630 --> 01:05:15.810
computer science because all the
computer science at least I learned is

01:05:15.810 --> 01:05:15.820
computer science at least I learned is
 

01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:18.410
computer science at least I learned is
just redundant for a quantum computer

01:05:18.410 --> 01:05:18.420
just redundant for a quantum computer
 

01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:21.060
just redundant for a quantum computer
and so we've got to put a complete new

01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:21.070
and so we've got to put a complete new
 

01:05:21.070 --> 01:05:22.500
and so we've got to put a complete new
system together so these are all

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:22.510
system together so these are all
 

01:05:22.510 --> 01:05:25.380
system together so these are all

to rebuild trust in the financial sector
but really through working out how we

01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:52.720
but really through working out how we
 

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:56.040
but really through working out how we
can work with technology and education

01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:56.050
can work with technology and education
 

01:05:56.050 --> 01:05:58.410
can work with technology and education
to bring financial security to the

to bring financial security to the
 

01:05:58.420 --> 01:06:00.780
to bring financial security to the
masses and I think there are so many

01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:00.790
masses and I think there are so many
 

01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:02.310
masses and I think there are so many
parallels I draw from the things we've

01:06:02.310 --> 01:06:02.320
parallels I draw from the things we've
 

01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:03.990
parallels I draw from the things we've
talked about but I don't see technology

01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:04.000
talked about but I don't see technology
 

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.780

challenge working with us in financial

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:08.650
challenge working with us in financial

financial education and security I'd

01:06:16.739 --> 01:06:16.749
financial education and security I'd
 

01:06:16.749 --> 01:06:18.420
financial education and security I'd
love your thoughts on that I mean I

01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:18.430
love your thoughts on that I mean I
 

01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:20.609
love your thoughts on that I mean I
think the first thing that you talked

01:06:20.609 --> 01:06:20.619
think the first thing that you talked
 

01:06:20.619 --> 01:06:24.900
think the first thing that you talked
about it's an issue that in fact I write

01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:24.910
about it's an issue that in fact I write
 

01:06:24.910 --> 01:06:30.180
about it's an issue that in fact I write
a bit about which is trust and how are

01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:30.190
a bit about which is trust and how are
 

01:06:30.190 --> 01:06:33.029
a bit about which is trust and how are
we as a technology company going to earn

01:06:33.029 --> 01:06:33.039
we as a technology company going to earn
 

01:06:33.039 --> 01:06:36.690
we as a technology company going to earn
the trust of users of digital technology

01:06:36.690 --> 01:06:36.700
the trust of users of digital technology
 

01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:38.670
the trust of users of digital technology
and that's a very multi constituent

01:06:38.670 --> 01:06:38.680
and that's a very multi constituent
 

01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:40.739
and that's a very multi constituent
piece and that's where I think we have

01:06:40.739 --> 01:06:40.749
piece and that's where I think we have
 

01:06:40.749 --> 01:06:42.720
piece and that's where I think we have
to do some of the best work ourselves as

01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:42.730
to do some of the best work ourselves as
 

01:06:42.730 --> 01:06:46.079
to do some of the best work ourselves as
technology providers but also we need a

01:06:46.079 --> 01:06:46.089
technology providers but also we need a
 

01:06:46.089 --> 01:06:48.059
technology providers but also we need a
policy framework that allows us to do

01:06:48.059 --> 01:06:48.069
policy framework that allows us to do
 

01:06:48.069 --> 01:06:49.620
policy framework that allows us to do
that but do your very specific question

01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:49.630
that but do your very specific question
 

01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:52.650
that but do your very specific question
this is the place where at least in our

01:06:52.650 --> 01:06:52.660
this is the place where at least in our
 

01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:55.650
this is the place where at least in our
context at Microsoft our entire business

01:06:55.650 --> 01:06:55.660
context at Microsoft our entire business
 

01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:59.670

model and our entire focus is how can we

01:06:59.670 --> 01:06:59.680
model and our entire focus is how can we
 

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:02.279

other sector of the economy so that they

01:07:08.039 --> 01:07:08.049
other sector of the economy so that they
 

01:07:08.049 --> 01:07:10.589
other sector of the economy so that they
can drive the dividends to all of their

01:07:10.589 --> 01:07:10.599
can drive the dividends to all of their
 

01:07:10.599 --> 01:07:12.630
can drive the dividends to all of their
constituents right that to me I mean

01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:12.640
constituents right that to me I mean
 

01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:14.249
constituents right that to me I mean
when I think about the cloud and what it

01:07:14.249 --> 01:07:14.259
when I think about the cloud and what it
 

01:07:14.259 --> 01:07:18.839
when I think about the cloud and what it
can mean it's an ingredient you know for

01:07:18.839 --> 01:07:18.849
can mean it's an ingredient you know for
 

01:07:18.849 --> 01:07:19.890
can mean it's an ingredient you know for
you to be able to reduce your

01:07:19.890 --> 01:07:19.900
you to be able to reduce your
 

01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:22.049
you to be able to reduce your
transactional costs and then I look at

01:07:22.049 --> 01:07:22.059
transactional costs and then I look at
 

01:07:22.059 --> 01:07:24.690
transactional costs and then I look at
even all of the blockchain applications

01:07:24.690 --> 01:07:24.700
even all of the blockchain applications
 

01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:27.059
even all of the blockchain applications
that are being written it's all

01:07:27.059 --> 01:07:27.069
that are being written it's all
 

01:07:27.069 --> 01:07:28.739
that are being written it's all
fundamentally so that the transactional

01:07:28.739 --> 01:07:28.749
fundamentally so that the transactional
 

01:07:28.749 --> 01:07:30.749
fundamentally so that the transactional
cost can come down and they can be more

01:07:30.749 --> 01:07:30.759
cost can come down and they can be more
 

01:07:30.759 --> 01:07:33.479
cost can come down and they can be more
trust and then whatever surplus gets

01:07:33.479 --> 01:07:33.489
trust and then whatever surplus gets
 

01:07:33.489 --> 01:07:36.900
trust and then whatever surplus gets
created gets actually split and you know

01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:36.910
created gets actually split and you know
 

01:07:36.910 --> 01:07:39.690
created gets actually split and you know
across all the constituents so my job at

01:07:39.690 --> 01:07:39.700
across all the constituents so my job at
 

01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:41.339
across all the constituents so my job at
least as I think of it is to really

01:07:41.339 --> 01:07:41.349
least as I think of it is to really
 

01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:44.370
least as I think of it is to really
bring that force of commoditization to

01:07:44.370 --> 01:07:44.380
bring that force of commoditization to
 

01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:46.140
bring that force of commoditization to
industry after industry

01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:46.150
industry after industry
 

01:07:46.150 --> 01:07:48.059
industry after industry
and we would definitely love to partner

01:07:48.059 --> 01:07:48.069
and we would definitely love to partner
 

01:07:48.069 --> 01:07:50.339
and we would definitely love to partner
up and we are in fact even right here in

01:07:50.339 --> 01:07:50.349
up and we are in fact even right here in
 

01:07:50.349 --> 01:07:52.349
up and we are in fact even right here in
the UK whether it's in financial

01:07:52.349 --> 01:07:52.359
the UK whether it's in financial
 

01:07:52.359 --> 01:07:54.539
the UK whether it's in financial
services or others and we do that not

01:07:54.539 --> 01:07:54.549
services or others and we do that not
 

01:07:54.549 --> 01:07:56.370
services or others and we do that not
only through technology but we have a

01:07:56.370 --> 01:07:56.380
only through technology but we have a
 

01:07:56.380 --> 01:08:00.150
only through technology but we have a
massive you know social responsibility

01:08:00.150 --> 01:08:00.160
massive you know social responsibility
 

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:01.769
massive you know social responsibility
and philanthropies piece to it too as

01:08:01.769 --> 01:08:01.779
and philanthropies piece to it too as
 

01:08:01.779 --> 01:08:04.410
and philanthropies piece to it too as
well and working with the government's

01:08:04.410 --> 01:08:04.420
well and working with the government's
 

01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:06.150
well and working with the government's
in partnership so it will be something

01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:06.160
in partnership so it will be something
 

01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:08.460
in partnership so it will be something
we should follow up in stock cards as a

01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:08.470
we should follow up in stock cards as a
 

01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:10.200
we should follow up in stock cards as a

01:20:20.170 --> 01:20:22.799
I just have had a new baby and I've
returned back to work so you obviously

01:20:22.799 --> 01:20:22.809
returned back to work so you obviously
 

01:20:22.809 --> 01:20:25.589
returned back to work so you obviously
have commitments at home and have

01:20:25.589 --> 01:20:25.599
have commitments at home and have
 

01:20:25.599 --> 01:20:28.529
have commitments at home and have
commitments to Microsoft and I wondered

01:20:28.529 --> 01:20:28.539
commitments to Microsoft and I wondered
 

01:20:28.539 --> 01:20:31.080
commitments to Microsoft and I wondered
if you had any tips on balancing in and

01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:31.090
if you had any tips on balancing in and
 

01:20:31.090 --> 01:20:36.810
if you had any tips on balancing in and
how you manage both I don't know if I

01:20:36.810 --> 01:20:36.820
how you manage both I don't know if I
 

01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:43.589
how you manage both I don't know if I
have any sort of tips except for what I

01:20:43.589 --> 01:20:43.599
have any sort of tips except for what I
 

01:20:43.599 --> 01:20:46.350
have any sort of tips except for what I
would need tried to do because it's such

01:20:46.350 --> 01:20:46.360
would need tried to do because it's such
 

01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:47.970
would need tried to do because it's such
a hard thing I mean this work-life

01:20:47.970 --> 01:20:47.980
a hard thing I mean this work-life
 

01:20:47.980 --> 01:20:50.779
a hard thing I mean this work-life
balance as some folks would describe it

01:20:50.779 --> 01:20:50.789
balance as some folks would describe it
 

01:20:50.789 --> 01:20:53.549
balance as some folks would describe it
it's just a real challenge and I've

01:20:53.549 --> 01:20:53.559
it's just a real challenge and I've
 

01:20:53.559 --> 01:20:57.839
it's just a real challenge and I've
struggled with it both my wife and I in

01:20:57.839 --> 01:20:57.849
struggled with it both my wife and I in
 

01:20:57.849 --> 01:20:59.819
struggled with it both my wife and I in
fact in some sense it was because of our

01:20:59.819 --> 01:20:59.829
fact in some sense it was because of our
 

01:20:59.829 --> 01:21:01.620
fact in some sense it was because of our
son's condition my wife had to even make

01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:01.630
son's condition my wife had to even make
 

01:21:01.630 --> 01:21:03.299
son's condition my wife had to even make
the hard trade-off of not going back

01:21:03.299 --> 01:21:03.309
the hard trade-off of not going back
 

01:21:03.309 --> 01:21:04.939
the hard trade-off of not going back
into the workforce

01:21:04.939 --> 01:21:04.949
into the workforce
 

01:21:04.949 --> 01:21:07.890
into the workforce
the one thing that oh I I think of now

01:21:07.890 --> 01:21:07.900
the one thing that oh I I think of now
 

01:21:07.900 --> 01:21:10.739
the one thing that oh I I think of now
is more the harmony versus the balance

01:21:10.739 --> 01:21:10.749
is more the harmony versus the balance
 

01:21:10.749 --> 01:21:12.720
is more the harmony versus the balance
because it's impossible for me to say

01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:12.730
because it's impossible for me to say
 

01:21:12.730 --> 01:21:14.549
because it's impossible for me to say
this is an equation that somehow has to

01:21:14.549 --> 01:21:14.559
this is an equation that somehow has to
 

01:21:14.559 --> 01:21:18.959
this is an equation that somehow has to
be balanced in all time so I'm at least

01:21:18.959 --> 01:21:18.969
be balanced in all time so I'm at least
 

01:21:18.969 --> 01:21:21.540
be balanced in all time so I'm at least
trying to develop in me more discipline

01:21:21.540 --> 01:21:21.550
trying to develop in me more discipline
 

01:21:21.550 --> 01:21:24.209
trying to develop in me more discipline
on in the moments I'm there

01:21:24.209 --> 01:21:24.219
on in the moments I'm there
 

01:21:24.219 --> 01:21:26.430
on in the moments I'm there
am I really there and this again is a

01:21:26.430 --> 01:21:26.440
am I really there and this again is a
 

01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:28.229
am I really there and this again is a
bit of a screen time type of question

01:21:28.229 --> 01:21:28.239
bit of a screen time type of question
 

01:21:28.239 --> 01:21:30.180
bit of a screen time type of question
there's lots of times I'm there and yet

01:21:30.180 --> 01:21:30.190
there's lots of times I'm there and yet
 

01:21:30.190 --> 01:21:33.290
there's lots of times I'm there and yet
I'm on my phone or I'm on my computer

01:21:33.290 --> 01:21:33.300
I'm on my phone or I'm on my computer
 

01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:35.879
I'm on my phone or I'm on my computer
and that's you know you're physically

01:21:35.879 --> 01:21:35.889
and that's you know you're physically
 

01:21:35.889 --> 01:21:37.459
and that's you know you're physically
there but you're really not

01:21:37.459 --> 01:21:37.469
there but you're really not
 

01:21:37.469 --> 01:21:40.469
there but you're really not
and so to me being disciplined about

01:21:40.469 --> 01:21:40.479
and so to me being disciplined about
 

01:21:40.479 --> 01:21:43.100
and so to me being disciplined about
doing those few things with your

01:21:43.100 --> 01:21:43.110
doing those few things with your
 

01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:47.780
doing those few things with your
children or with with my wife that are

01:21:47.780 --> 01:21:47.790
children or with with my wife that are
 

01:21:47.790 --> 01:21:49.760
children or with with my wife that are
more meditative in the sense that you're

01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:49.770
more meditative in the sense that you're
 

01:21:49.770 --> 01:21:51.080
more meditative in the sense that you're
in the moment I think are super

01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:51.090
in the moment I think are super
 

01:21:51.090 --> 01:21:52.820
in the moment I think are super
important and it requires a lot of

01:21:52.820 --> 01:21:52.830
important and it requires a lot of
 

01:21:52.830 --> 01:21:55.340
important and it requires a lot of
discipline and it's very hard at least

01:21:55.340 --> 01:21:55.350
discipline and it's very hard at least
 

01:21:55.350 --> 01:21:56.870
discipline and it's very hard at least
but that's at least what I'm pushing

01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:56.880
but that's at least what I'm pushing
 

01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:59.180
but that's at least what I'm pushing
myself to do I carry just about up to

01:21:59.180 --> 01:21:59.190
myself to do I carry just about up to
 

01:21:59.190 --> 01:22:00.770
myself to do I carry just about up to
time so the last two questions will take

01:22:00.770 --> 01:22:00.780
time so the last two questions will take
 

01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:03.170
time so the last two questions will take
together there's a gentleman or a woman

01:22:03.170 --> 01:22:03.180
together there's a gentleman or a woman
 

01:22:03.180 --> 01:22:04.460
together there's a gentleman or a woman
out there it was a woman actually but

01:22:04.460 --> 01:22:04.470
out there it was a woman actually but
 

01:22:04.470 --> 01:22:06.050
out there it was a woman actually but
you can even a Nichkhun are you okay as

01:22:06.050 --> 01:22:06.060
you can even a Nichkhun are you okay as
 

01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:08.630
you can even a Nichkhun are you okay as
good work-life balance there okay fine

01:22:08.630 --> 01:22:08.640
good work-life balance there okay fine
 

01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:10.760
good work-life balance there okay fine
yeah hopefully it's better yeah you

01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:10.770
yeah hopefully it's better yeah you
 

01:22:10.770 --> 01:22:12.650
yeah hopefully it's better yeah you
speaking for your the person next to you

01:22:12.650 --> 01:22:12.660
speaking for your the person next to you
 

01:22:12.660 --> 01:22:18.500
speaking for your the person next to you
yeah good so thank you the question is

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:18.510
yeah good so thank you the question is
 

01:22:18.510 --> 01:22:21.110
yeah good so thank you the question is
coming back to AI and you've mentioned

01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:21.120
coming back to AI and you've mentioned
 

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:24.560
coming back to AI and you've mentioned
about cyber security as well you know

01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:24.570
about cyber security as well you know
 

01:22:24.570 --> 01:22:26.660
about cyber security as well you know
talking about the control problem where

01:22:26.660 --> 01:22:26.670
talking about the control problem where
 

01:22:26.670 --> 01:22:30.500
talking about the control problem where
we have super intelligent AI that might

01:22:30.500 --> 01:22:30.510
we have super intelligent AI that might
 

01:22:30.510 --> 01:22:34.310
we have super intelligent AI that might
be released how confident I you in in

01:22:34.310 --> 01:22:34.320
be released how confident I you in in
 

01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:36.050
be released how confident I you in in
terms of cyber security when you know

01:22:36.050 --> 01:22:36.060
terms of cyber security when you know
 

01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:38.240
terms of cyber security when you know
cyber security nowadays as you know

01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:38.250
cyber security nowadays as you know
 

01:22:38.250 --> 01:22:41.960
cyber security nowadays as you know
99.9% is a good metric of screening for

01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:41.970
99.9% is a good metric of screening for
 

01:22:41.970 --> 01:22:45.980
99.9% is a good metric of screening for
for threats so how how how confident are

01:22:45.980 --> 01:22:45.990
for threats so how how how confident are
 

01:22:45.990 --> 01:22:48.380
for threats so how how how confident are
you in developing that when in the

01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:48.390
you in developing that when in the
 

01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:50.750
you in developing that when in the
future you know 99 percent might not be

01:22:50.750 --> 01:22:50.760
future you know 99 percent might not be
 

01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:53.030
future you know 99 percent might not be
good enough one last question here

01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:53.040
good enough one last question here
 

01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:54.820
good enough one last question here
that'll be it yeah one last question

01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:54.830
that'll be it yeah one last question
 

01:22:54.830 --> 01:22:56.030
that'll be it yeah one last question
yeah

01:22:56.030 --> 01:22:56.040
yeah

sorry
yeah so how do you think about China and

01:23:05.590 --> 01:23:05.600
yeah so how do you think about China and
 

01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:07.910
yeah so how do you think about China and
what's happening there because obviously

01:23:07.910 --> 01:23:07.920
what's happening there because obviously
 

01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:10.430
what's happening there because obviously
the focus has been the Silicon Valley

01:23:10.430 --> 01:23:10.440
the focus has been the Silicon Valley
 

01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:12.890
the focus has been the Silicon Valley
but a lot of work is going on in China

01:23:12.890 --> 01:23:12.900
but a lot of work is going on in China
 

01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:15.380
but a lot of work is going on in China
for in terms of technology and

01:23:15.380 --> 01:23:15.390
for in terms of technology and
 

01:23:15.390 --> 01:23:17.810
for in terms of technology and
development and do you have any thoughts

01:23:17.810 --> 01:23:17.820
development and do you have any thoughts
 

01:23:17.820 --> 01:23:20.060
development and do you have any thoughts
is it is it a threat it's an opportunity

01:23:20.060 --> 01:23:20.070
is it is it a threat it's an opportunity
 

01:23:20.070 --> 01:23:21.890
is it is it a threat it's an opportunity
and how do you deal with China that's a

01:23:21.890 --> 01:23:21.900
and how do you deal with China that's a
 

01:23:21.900 --> 01:23:24.470
and how do you deal with China that's a
great question so let me just take the

01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:24.480
great question so let me just take the
 

01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:25.220
great question so let me just take the
things quickly

01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:25.230
things quickly
 

01:23:25.230 --> 01:23:28.610
things quickly
um the control problem clearly is a one

01:23:28.610 --> 01:23:28.620
um the control problem clearly is a one
 

01:23:28.620 --> 01:23:33.530
um the control problem clearly is a one
of the big challenges as AGI happens and

01:23:33.530 --> 01:23:33.540
of the big challenges as AGI happens and
 

01:23:33.540 --> 01:23:38.200
of the big challenges as AGI happens and
my only point is let us not abdicate our

01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:38.210
my only point is let us not abdicate our
 

01:23:38.210 --> 01:23:40.850
my only point is let us not abdicate our
ability to control the control problem

01:23:40.850 --> 01:23:40.860
ability to control the control problem
 

01:23:40.860 --> 01:23:42.790
ability to control the control problem
if that makes any sense in other words

01:23:42.790 --> 01:23:42.800
if that makes any sense in other words
 

01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:46.250
if that makes any sense in other words
there is a lot of research that needs to

01:23:46.250 --> 01:23:46.260
there is a lot of research that needs to
 

01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:48.530
there is a lot of research that needs to
be done today on the control problem

01:23:48.530 --> 01:23:48.540
be done today on the control problem
 

01:23:48.540 --> 01:23:50.570
be done today on the control problem
what are four examples these are runaway

01:23:50.570 --> 01:23:50.580
what are four examples these are runaway
 

01:23:50.580 --> 01:23:52.820
what are four examples these are runaway
optimization challenges that's why I

01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:52.830
optimization challenges that's why I
 

01:23:52.830 --> 01:23:54.590
optimization challenges that's why I
kind of talk about what how do you make

01:23:54.590 --> 01:23:54.600
kind of talk about what how do you make
 

01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:55.600
kind of talk about what how do you make
compute

01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:55.610
compute
 

01:23:55.610 --> 01:23:59.260
compute
or these algorithms intelligible and

01:23:59.260 --> 01:23:59.270
or these algorithms intelligible and
 

01:23:59.270 --> 01:24:02.680
or these algorithms intelligible and
test them what is the test harness for

01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:02.690
test them what is the test harness for
 

01:24:02.690 --> 01:24:05.410
test them what is the test harness for
an agent that is independent you know

01:24:05.410 --> 01:24:05.420
an agent that is independent you know
 

01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:07.450
an agent that is independent you know
can you use some mechanism like these

01:24:07.450 --> 01:24:07.460
can you use some mechanism like these
 

01:24:07.460 --> 01:24:10.660
can you use some mechanism like these
adversarial networks to in fact test

01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:10.670
adversarial networks to in fact test
 

01:24:10.670 --> 01:24:14.410
adversarial networks to in fact test
even the the agent so I think that

01:24:14.410 --> 01:24:14.420
even the the agent so I think that
 

01:24:14.420 --> 01:24:16.510
even the the agent so I think that
there's a lot of research that a lot of

01:24:16.510 --> 01:24:16.520
there's a lot of research that a lot of
 

01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:18.310
