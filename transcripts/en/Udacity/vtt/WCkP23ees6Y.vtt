00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.021
In general, when we want to compute the slope of a line, we look at two points.

00:00:04.021 --> 00:00:08.524
We can label these points P1 and P2. We use a subscript to indicate which point

00:00:08.524 --> 00:00:12.264
it is. Now, these points could have any coordinates. So it'd be really

00:00:12.264 --> 00:00:16.294
unspecific or general in mathematical speak. We're just going to say that this

00:00:16.294 --> 00:00:20.657
point has some x coordinate and some y coordinate. We'll label the point x sub 1

00:00:20.657 --> 00:00:25.023
and y sub 1. The 1 is a subscript and it tells us which point we're on.

00:00:25.023 --> 00:00:29.643
Likewise, I could label this point x sub 2, y sub 2. We know slope is the ratio

00:00:29.643 --> 00:00:33.898
of the rise divided by the run. So this distance would just be the rise. If I

00:00:33.898 --> 00:00:38.486
wanted to find the rise between these two points, I would want to look at the y

00:00:38.486 --> 00:00:43.684
values. I would want to know how these y values changed. For example, if this y

00:00:43.684 --> 00:00:48.787
value was 5 and this y value was 3, I would just subtract them to figure out the

00:00:48.787 --> 00:00:53.832
rise. It'd be 2. We can see that the vertical distance or the rise is just the

00:00:53.832 --> 00:00:59.011
difference between the two y values, y2 minus y1. Knowing this information about

00:00:59.011 --> 00:01:03.423
the rise, which of the following do you think could represent the run? Is it the

00:01:03.423 --> 00:01:07.911
sum of the x coordinates, the difference of the x coordinates or the difference

00:01:07.911 --> 00:01:09.152
of the y coordinates?
