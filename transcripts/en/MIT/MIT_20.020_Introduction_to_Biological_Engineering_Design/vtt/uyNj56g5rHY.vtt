00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:10.326
&gt;&gt; Sally: What are you working on?

00:00:10.326 --> 00:00:11.616
&gt;&gt; Dude: I've got a great new idea.

00:00:11.616 --> 00:00:15.206
I'm going to make cocoa beans
that reproduce as fast as viruses.

00:00:15.316 --> 00:00:19.006
That way, we'll have enough cocoa beans
to make as much chocolate as we want!

00:00:19.256 --> 00:00:20.716
&gt;&gt; Sally: You know how much I like chocolate!

00:00:20.716 --> 00:00:22.826
Explain your project a little more.

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:25.126
How are you going to engineer this yummy idea?

00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:28.856
&gt;&gt; Dude: Well viruses reproduce really
fast so I thought I could take that part

00:00:28.856 --> 00:00:30.836
from a virus and put it into a cocoa plant.

00:00:31.206 --> 00:00:34.666
&gt;&gt; Sally: Plants are pretty safe to
work with but viruses can be dangerous.

00:00:34.756 --> 00:00:36.706
Which virus were you thinking about using?

00:00:36.896 --> 00:00:39.366
&gt;&gt; Dude: Well I read that Ebola
virus has a short sequence that...

00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:39.936
&gt;&gt; Sally: ...EBOLA!?!

00:00:40.226 --> 00:00:43.186
Ebola is a bio-safety level FOUR agent.

00:00:43.186 --> 00:00:46.176
&gt;&gt; Dude: Well the worst are level
five, so I thought it was safe enough.

00:00:46.386 --> 00:00:47.336
&gt;&gt; Sally: Level five?

00:00:47.386 --> 00:00:49.496
There is no bio-safety level five.

00:00:49.606 --> 00:00:54.186
You'd need lots and lots of training to
work in any level three or four facility...

00:00:54.296 --> 00:00:57.586
...and you'd have to wait a few years
since they don't let minors in those labs.

00:00:57.656 --> 00:01:00.136
&gt;&gt; Dude: DD: But there was
this show I saw on TV where...

00:01:00.136 --> 00:01:03.196
&gt;&gt; Sally: What you see on TV and
in movies can be very deceiving.

00:01:03.306 --> 00:01:05.626
But let's talk about all the bio-safety levels.

00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:09.236
If we're going to make your viral cocoa
beans, we need to come up with a way

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:12.516
that keeps everyone safe,
inside the lab and outside too.

00:01:12.856 --> 00:01:13.516
&gt;&gt; Dude: OK.

00:01:13.676 --> 00:01:18.086
I do know that biosafety is a combination
of safe lab practices and techniques,

00:01:18.176 --> 00:01:22.146
wearing the right safety equipment, and working
in a lab designed to contain the experiment.

00:01:22.216 --> 00:01:24.956
But with biosafety level
1 that just means a room

00:01:24.956 --> 00:01:26.936
with screened windows and a door that closes.

00:01:26.986 --> 00:01:28.396
That doesn't sound like much.

00:01:28.486 --> 00:01:32.566
&gt;&gt; Sally: That's because BL1 experiments
use only well-characterized microbes

00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:34.376
that don't make a healthy person sick.

00:01:34.526 --> 00:01:37.176
But remember, there's no
eating or drinking in the lab

00:01:37.176 --> 00:01:39.836
since you wouldn't want to eat your experiments.

00:01:40.036 --> 00:01:42.306
&gt;&gt; Dude: When do I get to
wear a lab coat like yours?

00:01:42.456 --> 00:01:46.485
&gt;&gt; Sally: If you're working at biosafety level
2, you'll have to wear it, and gloves, too,

00:01:46.485 --> 00:01:48.765
since some BL2 agents can be infectious.

00:01:48.906 --> 00:01:54.146
BL2 labs have impervious benches and most of
the work is done in biological safety cabinets.

00:01:54.246 --> 00:01:58.816
Lots of BL2 workers also get immunizations
if they'll be working with certain agents.

00:01:58.976 --> 00:02:00.956
&gt;&gt; Dude: I hate getting shots.

00:02:01.046 --> 00:02:04.126
&gt;&gt; Sally: Well, not all level
2 agents require immunizations.

00:02:04.216 --> 00:02:07.396
Really, the rules for BL1
and BL2 are pretty basic

00:02:07.466 --> 00:02:10.226
because the agents have minimal
risk associated with them.

00:02:10.496 --> 00:02:13.476
But let's think for a minute
about what biosafety you'd need

00:02:13.476 --> 00:02:15.696
for your mash-up of a virus with a cocoa plant.

00:02:16.036 --> 00:02:20.096
&gt;&gt; Dude: Well maybe more protective clothes,
like the workers in bio-safety level 3 labs.

00:02:20.276 --> 00:02:23.246
They wear full suits and
maybe masks or something.

00:02:23.336 --> 00:02:24.766
It's nothing I can't handle.

00:02:25.006 --> 00:02:27.506
Imagine me in a space suit!

00:02:27.776 --> 00:02:29.286
Very cool!

00:02:29.446 --> 00:02:31.626
And think about how much chocolate we'll have!

00:02:31.626 --> 00:02:32.996
&gt;&gt; Sally: Earth to Dude!

00:02:32.996 --> 00:02:38.646
Level three agents are very serious, potentially
lethal, and level four agents, like Ebola virus,

00:02:38.646 --> 00:02:41.305
have such a high lethal risk
that there are only a few places

00:02:41.305 --> 00:02:42.836
in the world where they are studied.

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:45.966
Restrictions for working with
these agents are very tight.

00:02:46.126 --> 00:02:50.516
Everything entering or leaving BL3
and BL4 labs has to be decontaminated.

00:02:50.706 --> 00:02:54.055
Sometimes the lab has to be in its
own building to control foot traffic.

00:02:54.136 --> 00:02:57.526
I know I don't want to work where there
are double door entries and airlock rooms.

00:02:57.676 --> 00:02:58.916
&gt;&gt; Dude: I think that sounds like fun...

00:02:59.136 --> 00:03:01.416
&gt;&gt; Sally: ...If you are so excited
about the protective clothing,

00:03:01.416 --> 00:03:04.906
we can always be overly cautious
in a level 1 or 2 facility.

00:03:04.906 --> 00:03:07.586
But can't we find another
way to make more cocoa beans?

00:03:07.816 --> 00:03:08.826
&gt;&gt; Dude: OK.

00:03:09.036 --> 00:03:11.706
&gt;&gt; Sally: Maybe we can find another
virus that's not so dangerous

00:03:11.706 --> 00:03:13.606
and we can keep working on your chocolate idea.

00:03:13.926 --> 00:03:15.286
Let's start looking in here.
