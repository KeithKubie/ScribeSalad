 We have an amazing
 show for you tonight.

00:00:23.122 --> 00:00:24.590 size:88% position:44%
  But first, did you
  hear about this?

00:00:24.623 --> 00:00:25.558
Very, very interesting.

00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:27.693
Now, apparently Disney
is coming out with a new

00:00:27.726 --> 00:00:30.063 align:start size:88% position:13%
musical, yes, it
involves a lot of white

00:00:30.096 --> 00:00:31.564 size:84% position:42%
  people on skates.

00:00:31.597 --> 00:00:33.299
Apparently they're calling it...

00:00:33.332 --> 00:00:34.667
hockey.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.302 size:88% position:44%
  (laughing)

00:00:36.335 --> 00:00:37.503
 Ohhhh!

00:00:37.536 --> 00:00:40.774 align:start size:88% position:13%
Joke, joke, joke,
joke, joke, joke, joke!

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:43.676
Hey, am I right, please?

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:46.612
Now it's time for one of
our favorite segments.

00:00:46.645 --> 00:00:49.415 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Singing on motorcycles
 in traffic.

00:00:49.448 --> 00:00:51.250 align:start size:88% position:13%
Now today's guest is
none other than two time

00:00:51.283 --> 00:00:54.087 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Academy Award winner,
 Daniel Day Lewis.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.688
 Let's see how he did!

00:00:55.721 --> 00:00:56.722 size:88% position:44%
 (audience cheering)

00:00:56.755 --> 00:00:59.125 size:84% position:42%

 (audience cheering)

00:01:03.662 --> 00:01:05.331
Oh my goodness, so good.

00:01:05.364 --> 00:01:07.867 size:88% position:44%
 I would even say shareable.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.868 size:88% position:44%
 I mean, am I right?

00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:09.869
(laughs)

00:01:09.902 --> 00:01:12.238
 Seriously, share it, please.

00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:13.439 size:84% position:42%
  Share it.

00:01:13.472 --> 00:01:14.774 size:84% position:42% line:0%
  Share it.

00:01:14.807 --> 00:01:17.143 size:88% position:44% line:0%
 Share it right now.

00:01:20.646 --> 00:01:22.348
(ominous music)

00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:23.182 size:84% position:42%
  Oh, okay!

00:01:23.215 --> 00:01:24.417 size:88% position:44%
 (audience laughter)

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.651
It's time to introduce
our very special friend.

00:01:25.684 --> 00:01:28.121 size:88% position:44%
 You know him, it is
 Kevin the IT guy!

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:29.388
 - Hi, hello.

00:01:29.421 --> 00:01:32.391
 - That accent, I mean,
 who can understand it?

00:01:32.424 --> 00:01:35.661
Now, Kevin, tell us,
tell the folks at home,

00:01:35.694 --> 00:01:36.863
 what did you do this weekend?

00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:38.764 size:88% position:44%
 - Oh, I made my own dinner.

00:01:38.797 --> 00:01:40.833
 - Oooh, interesting,
 what did you have?

00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:42.702
 - Craisins, asparagus,

00:01:44.703 --> 00:01:46.539 size:88% position:44%
  and I make my own seltzer.

00:01:46.572 --> 00:01:48.741 size:88% position:44%
 (audience laughter)

00:01:48.774 --> 00:01:51.310
- I get it, I get it, I get it.

00:01:51.343 --> 00:01:52.378 size:88% position:44%
  You are different from me,

00:01:52.411 --> 00:01:53.546
and that is funny to us.

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.481 size:88% position:44%
  (laughing)

00:01:55.514 --> 00:01:56.616 align:start position:0%
  Now after all that
  dinner, I think that Kevin

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.818 size:88% position:44%
  could lose a few calories.

00:01:58.851 --> 00:02:02.755
So it's time for Kevin
Learns How To Do Things!

00:02:05.791 --> 00:02:07.426
Oh my goodness.

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:08.794 align:start position:0%
 Now with the help of our
 lovely and talented Sophia,

00:02:08.827 --> 00:02:10.463
(kisses)

00:02:10.496 --> 00:02:12.398 align:start position:0%
  today we are going to
  teach Kevin how to dance.

00:02:12.431 --> 00:02:13.866 size:88% position:44%
 Come on out, Kevin.

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:16.669 size:88% position:44%
 (audience applause)

00:02:16.702 --> 00:02:17.770 size:88% position:44%
 - Is this outfit necessary?

00:02:17.803 --> 00:02:20.840 size:84% position:42%
  - Hey, putting you down
  makes me look better, eh!

00:02:20.873 --> 00:02:21.841 size:88% position:44%
 (audience laughter)

00:02:21.874 --> 00:02:22.742
 Take it away, Sophia.

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:24.243
 - We are going to do
 the Bachata today.

00:02:24.276 --> 00:02:25.645
Here we go, we go to the right,

00:02:25.678 --> 00:02:26.846
- Right.

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:27.847 size:88% position:44%
 - And left.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.916 size:88% position:44%
  (mumbling)

00:02:31.517 --> 00:02:35.288 size:84% position:42%
  - Ah, it looks like Kevin
  was really feeling it.

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:38.591
Let's take a look at the replay.

00:02:38.624 --> 00:02:41.628 size:88% position:44% line:0%
 (audience laughter)

00:02:43.562 --> 00:02:44.597
 - You look so stupid!

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.265 size:88% position:44%
 - But how great was Sophia?

00:02:46.298 --> 00:02:47.200 size:88% position:44%
 Am I right?

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:48.601
 Give her a round of applause.

00:02:48.634 --> 00:02:50.469 size:88% position:44%
 (audience cheering)

00:02:50.502 --> 00:02:51.604
Now as many of you know,

00:02:51.637 --> 00:02:53.506
next week I will be on vacation.

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:54.874 size:88% position:44%
 - Have a good trip!

00:02:54.907 --> 00:02:55.975
 - Thank you.

00:02:56.008 --> 00:02:56.976 size:88% position:44%
 Don't tell my wife.

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.977 size:88% position:44%
  (laughing)

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.978
- No, she knows.

00:02:59.011 --> 00:03:00.413 size:88% position:44%
  She knows.

00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:01.981
But I'm very excited
to announce who's gonna

00:03:02.014 --> 00:03:03.783
be filling in for me next week.

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:06.219 align:start position:0%
  Now one of the most
  talented comedians I know,

00:03:06.252 --> 00:03:07.853 size:84% position:42%
  so funny.

00:03:07.886 --> 00:03:08.888
She's one of the most--

00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:10.456
 - No!

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:11.490
(audience jeers)

00:03:11.523 --> 00:03:12.458
- No, I don't want that!

00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:13.793 size:88% position:44%
  - Or, it can be...

00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:16.796
any guy.

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.331 size:88% position:44%
 (audience cheering)

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:19.799 size:88% position:44%
  - Any guy!

00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:21.334
Any guy!

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:22.635
Any guy!

00:03:22.668 --> 00:03:23.669 size:84% position:42%
  - Oh man, that was close.

00:03:23.702 --> 00:03:24.670
Got you.

00:03:24.703 --> 00:03:25.905
 That was a lot of fun.

00:03:25.938 --> 00:03:27.873
Almost as fun as
our band leader,

00:03:27.906 --> 00:03:28.908
 BJ Lawrence.

00:03:30.743 --> 00:03:33.846 size:88% position:44%
 (electronic air horn blows)

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:34.880
 (upbeat techno music)

00:03:34.913 --> 00:03:35.881
 - I already told you,

00:03:35.914 --> 00:03:36.682
 I'm not in the (bleep) band!

00:03:36.715 --> 00:03:38.985 align:start size:88% position:13%
  I'm Steve, the
  Script Supervisor.

00:03:39.018 --> 00:03:40.419
 You think I'm the DJ

00:03:40.452 --> 00:03:41.621 align:start size:88% position:13%
  cause I'm the only
  black guy here!

00:03:41.654 --> 00:03:42.888
(laughs)

00:03:42.921 --> 00:03:45.891
 - Well, we're not done
 with the fun just yet.

00:03:45.924 --> 00:03:47.560 align:start position:0%
  Now throughout the
  night, we've been telling

00:03:47.593 --> 00:03:49.395 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Kevin that he's going
 to a cooking show,

00:03:49.428 --> 00:03:51.797
 when in reality, we're
 sending him to meet

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.267
 notorious drug lord, El Tuco!

00:03:54.967 --> 00:03:55.935 size:88% position:44%
 (audience cheering)

00:03:55.968 --> 00:03:58.438 size:88% position:44%
  (chanting)

00:03:59.838 --> 00:04:00.673
I lied!

00:04:02.608 --> 00:04:04.277
 - Have a great trip!

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.579 size:88% position:44%
 (audience cheering)

00:04:06.612 --> 00:04:08.914 size:88% position:44%
 - You're going to love him!

00:04:08.947 --> 00:04:10.850
 Now, tune in next week
 when a famous actress

00:04:10.883 --> 00:04:12.518
 pretends to find me charming

00:04:12.551 --> 00:04:14.320 size:88% position:44%
 in order to plug her movie.

00:04:14.353 --> 00:04:18.258
And until then, Buenas,
Buenas, Buenas, Noches!

00:04:19.458 --> 00:04:22.061
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:04:22.094 --> 00:04:23.362
 Alright, get me outta
 this fucking place.

00:04:23.395 --> 00:04:24.897 size:88% position:44%
  Thank you.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.667
(acoustic guitar strums)
