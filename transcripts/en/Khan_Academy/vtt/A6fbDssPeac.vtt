00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.930
Let s sub k for k is equal
to 1, to all the way to 100,

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.890
denote the sum of the infinite
geometric series whose

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.510
first term is k minus
1 over k factorial.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.200
And the common
ratio is 1 over k.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.200
Then the value of 100 squared
over 100 factorial plus the sum

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.180
from k equals 1 to 100
of the absolute value

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.180
of this thing over here, k
squared minus 3k plus 1 times

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.170
s sub k is.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.840
So this looks like a
pretty daunting thing.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.380
But I guess a good
place to start

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:39.490
would just to be find a
simple way to express s sub k.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.380
So if we were to
write s sub k is

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:49.140
equal to the first term is
k minus 1 over k factorial.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.040
And then the common
ratio is 1 over k.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.230
So it's going to be 1 over k
to the 0 plus 1 over k to the 1

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.800
plus 1 over k squared.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.730
It's just going to
keep going on forever.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.569
It is an infinite
geometric series.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:06.990
Now there is a very
well-known formula

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.790
for the sum of an
infinite geometric series.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.200
I enjoy the proof of
it so much that we're

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.230
going to do it again.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.630
And I've done it
multiple times already,

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.505
but it's such a simple
proof that it's always

00:01:17.505 --> 00:01:19.005
good to start from
basic principles.

00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:20.713
If you're doing this
under time pressure,

00:01:20.713 --> 00:01:22.150
you could just use the formula.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.280
But if we say, let's
just say some other sum.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.446
Let's call this thing just s.

00:01:29.446 --> 00:01:35.570
s is equal to 1 over k to
the 0 plus 1 over k to the 1

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.830
plus 1 over k squared all
the way, keep going on

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:39.940
into infinity.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.430
Now let's multiply
1 over k times s.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.220
1 over k times s is just going
to be 1 over k times each

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.860
of these terms.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.060
When I multiply 1 over
k times this term,

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.700
I'm going to get 1 over
k to the first power.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.740
When I multiply 1 over
k times this term,

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.800
I'm going to get 1 over
k to the second power all

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.050
the way on to infinity.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.940
So if I were to
subtract this from that.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.560
So if I were to subtract that--
so this coefficient is 1.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.790
So it's 1.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.550
So we have 1 minus
1 over k times

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.150
s-- I'm just
subtracting that-- would

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.426
be equal to all of this stuff
minus all of this stuff.

00:02:12.426 --> 00:02:13.800
That's going to
cancel with that.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.710
That's going to
cancel with that.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.168
We're just going
to keep canceling.

00:02:16.168 --> 00:02:18.340
And we're just going to
have this first term here

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.650
which is to the 0-th power.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.330
Or 1 over k to the 0 power
is going to be equal to 1.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.700
Or that this whole sum is going
to be equal to 1 over 1 minus 1

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.070
over k.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.710
And so we can rewrite s sub k.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.445
So we could rewrite s sub k.

00:02:35.445 --> 00:02:45.039
s sub k is equal to k minus
1 over k factorial times,

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:47.580
before I write it up here, let's
see if we can simplify this.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.288
If I want to simplify
this I can multiply

00:02:49.288 --> 00:02:50.980
the numerator and
the denominator by k.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.470
If I do that, I have
k on the numerator

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.930
and then the denominator
becomes k minus 1.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:04.970
So this right here
is k over k minus 1.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.040
And these will cancel out.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.422
And so this will
be equal to-- we

00:03:08.422 --> 00:03:10.130
have to be careful
when we cancel it out.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.075
Because this kind
of precluded-- well,

00:03:12.075 --> 00:03:13.450
I'll talk about
that in a second.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.615
So this will be equal
to k over k factorial.

00:03:17.615 --> 00:03:19.730
And what's k over k factorial?

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.640
Remember, this is equal
to k over-- k factorial

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:30.050
is k times k minus 1 times k
minus 2 all the way down to 1.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.150
So these k's are
going to cancel out.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.420
So it's going to be equal to
1 over k minus 1 times k minus

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.700
2 times k minus 3,
all the way down to 1.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:46.380
Which is the same thing
as k minus 1 factorial.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.340
Now we want to make sure that we
get the right value for s sub 1

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.620
and s sub 2.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.030
So let's just get this.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.260
So s sub 1, what's that
going to be equal to?

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.995
And 0 factorial is
always a bit of a debate

00:03:58.995 --> 00:03:59.870
that people can have.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:00.840
But it becomes a
little bit simpler

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.940
when you look at the
original expression here.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.170
If you put k is equal to 1
here, this just becomes a 0.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.900
We lose that because
it cancels later on,

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.120
and that's why I was kind
of warning to be careful.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.780
But we have 1 minus
1 that's clearly

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.460
going to be 0 regardless
of whether you

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.890
consider 0 factorial be 1 or 0.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.450
It's clearly, clearly
going to be 0 over here.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.510
So s sub 1 is going to be 0
times a bunch of other stuff.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.910
So s sub 1 is going to be 0.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.850
What's s sub 2 going to be?

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.230
s sub 2 is going to be--
Now we can just use this.

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:39.500
It's 1 over 2 factorial which
is just going to be equal to 1.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.200
So with that out of
the way, let's think

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.220
about this sum over here.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.490
Let's think about this sum.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.570
We have the sum.

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.440
Actually, before I write it,
it's from k equals 1 to 100.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.150
But let's just actually
figure out so when k equals 1,

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.570
s sub 1 is 0.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.830
So this doesn't even
contribute to it.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.600
When k is equal to
2, we have a 2 here.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.000
Well, let me just
solve it this way

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.442
since we already
got the 2 there.

00:05:08.442 --> 00:05:09.650
And then we can start from 3.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:16.100
When k is equal to 2,
s sub 2 is equal to 1.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.440
And then we have 2 squared.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.710
So that's 4 minus 6 plus 1.

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.800
So that's negative 1 times
1 which is negative 1.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.070
But then we take the
absolute value of it.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:32.057
So the value when-- for
the second term here,

00:05:32.057 --> 00:05:33.390
the first term is going to be 0.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.490
The second term here is
just going to be positive 1.

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.520
So this sum over here is
going to be equal to 0.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.600
This is when k is
equal to 1 plus 1.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.170
This is when k is
equal to 2 plus,

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.920
and now we can worry
about the sum from k

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.960
is equal to 3 to 100.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.840
Notice, it was k
equals 1 to 100.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.420
But I did the first two terms.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:00.410
They were a 0 and a 1.

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.530
So now we have to just
worry about 3 to 100.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.470
And let's rewrite
this expression

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.480
inside the absolute value sign.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.440
So inside the
absolute value sign,

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.050
we have this thing
over here times

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.980
s sub k. s sub k
is this over here.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.410
It's k minus 1 factorial.

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.910
So you have that whole thing
being divided essentially

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.475
by k minus 1 factorial.

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:27.390
This is the s sub k.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.310
It's 1 over k minus 1 factorial.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:30.970
I'm just putting
in the denominator.

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:32.650
And you have this thing.

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.500
You have that thing
in the numerator.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.305
Now my first gut instinct
to see if I could factor

00:06:38.305 --> 00:06:41.030
this, no easy way
to factor this.

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.520
But my second gut
instinct, hopefully,

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.530
is to see is if there's any
way that I could express this

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:51.140
in terms of k minus 1's
or k minus k's or anything

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.960
like that, that somehow
will make an easy pattern.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.043
Because what tends to be the
case with these type of-- you

00:06:58.043 --> 00:06:59.550
know you have this crazy sum.

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.039
Clearly you're not going to
be able to do it by hand.

00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:03.330
Things are going to cancel out.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.380
Normally, you have things
like maybe they oscillate,

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:12.160
maybe you have stuff like 1
plus 2 minus 2 plus 3 minus 3.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.030
And so all of the
middle terms cancel out,

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:15.780
and you just have the first
term and the last term.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.340
That tends to be the case for
things like this when there's

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.320
not some easy
simplification over here

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:26.090
or some easy formula like
an infinite geometric sum.

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:27.460
So let's see if we can do that.

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:28.950
One way we could express this.

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:30.700
So let me write this
over here separately.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.450
k squared minus 3k plus 1.

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:39.940
We could write this as k
squared minus 2k plus 1 minus k.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:42.860
Obviously minus 2k
minus k is negative 3k.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:46.090
And the reason why I do that is
this becomes a perfect square.

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:49.330
This is k minus 1 squared.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.165
k minus 1 squared minus k.

00:07:52.165 --> 00:07:54.540
And this looks interesting
because it's now expressing it

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.552
in terms of simple
terms, especially when

00:07:56.552 --> 00:07:58.010
you're dealing with
factorials, you

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:00.310
like dealing with k minus
1's and k's and maybe

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:01.910
it'll simplify a little bit.

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:04.080
So I'll write this
expression here

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:08.200
as k minus 1 squared minus k.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.890
And let's try to simplify it.

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:11.640
Let's try to simplify
it even more.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.502
So this whole thing is
going to become, or at least

00:08:14.502 --> 00:08:16.460
we're just dealing with
the sum part right now,

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:18.709
we're not really dealing
with the 100 squared over 100

00:08:18.709 --> 00:08:20.650
factorial just yet.

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:24.990
But this sum is going to
be 1 plus the sum from k

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:31.580
is equal to 3 to 100 of
the absolute value of-- we

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:35.784
have k minus 1 squared
over k minus 1 factorial.

00:08:35.784 --> 00:08:37.159
Let me just do it
separately here

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:39.299
so I don't have to rewrite this
sigma notation over and over.

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:41.919
This expression right over
here is the exact same thing

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:50.570
as k minus 1 squared over
k minus 1 factorial minus k

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:53.240
over k minus 1 factorial.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.950
It's the exact same
thing, but what's

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:58.000
interesting about this term,
remember, k minus 1 factorial,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.420
that's k minus 1
times k minus-- sorry,

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:04.530
k minus-- let me
write it this way.

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:11.080
k minus 1 factorial is k
minus 1 times k minus 2

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.650
all the way down to 1.

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:14.359
That's what this term
is right over here.

00:09:14.359 --> 00:09:15.983
So we have a k minus
1 squared up here.

00:09:15.983 --> 00:09:17.690
We have a k minus 1
in the denominator.

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:23.130
This will cancel out with one
of the k minus 1's out here.

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.100
This first term over here
simplifies to k minus 1

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:30.011
in the numerator over-- we
don't have k minus 1 factorial

00:09:30.011 --> 00:09:30.510
anymore.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:33.050
We now have k minus 2 times
k minus 3 all the way down.

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:37.840
So now this is k
minus 2 factorial.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:43.510
And this is still minus k
over k minus 1 factorial.

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:45.980
And this looks interesting now.

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.340
This looks pretty interesting.

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:50.730
It looks like a
pattern might emerge.

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:52.720
If whatever the k's,
you go in the numerator

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.080
down one, on the
numerator and down two

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.730
on the denominator
for the factorial,

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.086
and then you subtract it.

00:09:58.086 --> 00:09:59.460
But then for the
next k, it looks

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.070
like you'll have some cancel.

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:03.100
Let's try it out
with some numbers.

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.840
So this is going to be equal to.

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:09.720
When k is equal to
3, this expression

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.285
is going to be the absolute
value of 2 over 1 factorial.

00:10:13.285 --> 00:10:19.610
2 over 1 factorial minus
3 over 2 factorial.

00:10:24.639 --> 00:10:25.930
So that's when k is equal to 3.

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:29.550
And to that we're going to
add when k is equal to 4.

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:32.850
When k is equal to 4, we're
going to have 4 minus 1

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:34.990
is 3 over 2 factorial.

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:39.265
3 over 2 factorial minus
4 over 3 factorial.

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:43.510
I could keep going.

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:46.450
Let's do it when
k is equal to 5.

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:55.290
When k is equal to 5, I have 4
over 3 factorial minus 5 over 4

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:55.790
factorial.

00:10:58.090 --> 00:10:59.340
And I think you see a pattern.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:02.060
We're going to keep
doing this all the way

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:04.420
to what's the
absolute last term?

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:08.370
The absolute last term
is k is equal to 100.

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:12.830
So we go all the way
to k is equal to 100.

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:17.640
At 100, you're going to have
the absolute value of 99

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:27.806
over 98 factorial minus
100 over 99 factorial.

00:11:27.806 --> 00:11:29.680
Now the pattern you
might-- and of course, we

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.930
have this 1 out front.

00:11:33.629 --> 00:11:35.170
Now what's this
going to simplify to?

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:36.253
You might see the pattern.

00:11:36.253 --> 00:11:37.914
We're subtracting a
3 over 2 factorial,

00:11:37.914 --> 00:11:39.330
we're adding a 3
over 2 factorial,

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:42.120
we're subtracting a
4 over 3 factorial,

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.087
then we're adding it.

00:11:43.087 --> 00:11:45.420
And you might say, well, what
about the absolute values?

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:49.400
But when you look over
here, this the second term

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:53.790
of these absolute
value signs is always

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:59.240
going to be a smaller
value than the first term.

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:03.850
And that's because we have
a larger value over here.

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:05.415
We only have k
minus 1 factorial.

00:12:05.415 --> 00:12:07.599
And factorials
increase quite quickly.

00:12:07.599 --> 00:12:09.390
We only have k minus
1 factorial over here.

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:12.080
We only have k minus
2 factorial over here.

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.650
So this is always going
to be less than this.

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:16.770
This right here is 3/2.

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:18.190
This right here is 2.

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:20.640
This right here is, what is it?

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.240
4 over 6.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.380
So this is only 2/3.

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:25.130
This is 1 and 1/2.

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:27.790
So the second term is always
less than the first term.

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:29.700
So this is going
to just evaluate

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.950
to be the same thing without
the absolute value signs.

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:35.470
This is always going
to be a positive value.

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:38.055
So you actually could ignore
the absolute value signs.

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:45.400
And now it becomes I think
pretty pretty pretty clear how

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.890
the cancellation
is going to happen.

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:50.950
You can ignore the
absolute value signs.

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:53.030
And now we have
a situation where

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:56.240
the second term from this one
for k is equal to 3 cancels

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.820
with the first term
from k equals 4.

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.010
Those cancel.

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:00.454
Then these two cancel.

00:13:00.454 --> 00:13:02.870
Then this is going to cancel
with the one from k equals 6.

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:04.140
Going to keep happening.

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:07.670
This is going to cancel with the
second term from k equals 99.

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:11.790
And we're just left
with the one out front.

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:16.770
1 plus this 2 over 1
factorial which is just 2.

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:20.405
And then we have minus
100 over 99 factorial.

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:26.817
And remember, we also
had this whole time

00:13:26.817 --> 00:13:29.400
I didn't pay attention to this
100 squared over 100 factorial.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.550
But I can do it now.

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:32.460
But what is 100 squared?

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:35.300
100 squared is 100 times
100 over 100 factorial.

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:39.980
So that's 100 times 99 times
98 all the way down to 1.

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:41.010
These cancel out.

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:45.039
This is the same thing
as 100 over 99 factorial,

00:13:45.039 --> 00:13:46.330
which we're going to add to it.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:49.900
So this is 100 over 99
factorial right over here.

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:51.180
So let's add that.

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:54.610
We have 100 over 99 factorial.

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:58.460
Lucky for us, that first term
and this last term cancel out.

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:03.550
And we are just left with
1 plus 2 is equal to 3.

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:06.500
So that fairly daunting
thing, the main trick

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:09.120
was trying to see how to
simplify this in a way

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.750
that maybe a pattern
would emerge.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:13.240
And that's really the
hard part of this problem.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:17.790
But we get this entire
sum is equal to 3.
