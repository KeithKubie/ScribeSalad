COLT MCANLIS: Hey everybody.

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:03.590
My name is Colt McAnlis.

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:05.900
And I'm here to take a
quick look behind the scenes

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.770
at some of Google's
data centers.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.390
You see, on March 25,
the Google Cloud Platform

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.630
has an exciting event
planned that you're not

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.570
going to want to miss.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.028
But before then,
I figured it would

00:00:15.028 --> 00:00:18.202
be good to take a look at how
Google works under the hood.

00:00:18.202 --> 00:00:19.660
Because when you
talk about Google,

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.920
what you're really
talking about is scale.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.220
You see, we serve over 6
billion hours of YouTube video

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.120
every single month.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.440
And at the same time,
service 100 billion

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.690
searches from Google.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.340
And my personal favorite,
activate 1,000 Android devices

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.890
every single minute.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.170
Working at that scale
is no easy task.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.120
We've had to build a
global infrastructure

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.030
to handle the load.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.790
Everything from laying fiber
across the Pacific Ocean

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.360
to building data
centers that blur

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.920
the line between
science, art, and utility

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.700
to create something great.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.440
For example, take a look at
this data center in Oregon.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.350
All of these colored pipes
here are not just for show.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.900
Each color details
important information

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.040
about the water temperature and
flow direction, which trust me,

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.060
is important when you're
trying to track down

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.307
a leak in miles of tubing.

00:01:04.307 --> 00:01:06.390
And take a look at this
row of servers in Georgia.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.450
These energy-efficient
high-powered LEDs

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.990
let us know that everything
is running smoothly

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.400
in the server rack.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.130
And this data center
in South Carolina

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.950
hosts a three-story
warehouse of machines.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.780
When one of these
bad boys break down,

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.510
that automated robot over there,
actually grabs the tape drive

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.976
and removes it for you.

00:01:24.976 --> 00:01:26.600
The best part about
all this technology

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.860
is that we're not
keeping it to ourselves.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.690
Through the power of the
Google Cloud Platform,

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.910
you've got access to the
same network, compute,

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.230
and storage that runs all
of Google's infrastructure.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.690
And it's offered in a way
that allows you to mix, match,

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.570
and combine APIs and services
to fit your application needs.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.160
Which is exactly what the
Snapchat developers did.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.320
You see, they're small
four-person team was

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.520
able to leverage the scalable
power of Google App Engine

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.880
to make Snapchat one of the
hottest downloads of 2013,

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.470
serving over 350
million photos a day.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.930
And consider the Song Pop folks,
who in a few short months,

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.010
went from obscurity to serving
2.5 million daily active users,

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.690
while only assigning a
single engineer to worry

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.440
about performance and uptime.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.350
Which is exactly
what you'd expect

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.130
when you're running on the same
exact hardware and software

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.182
that powers all of
Google services.

00:02:18.182 --> 00:02:19.890
When we're talking
about Cloud offerings,

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.973
it's really easy to get
bogged down in the minutia

00:02:21.973 --> 00:02:25.270
of key words like site
isolation, or virtual machines,

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.610
or load balancing.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.170
And sometimes we forget
the small stuff, the nuts,

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.520
the bolts, the solder wires,
the joints, the cooling fans,

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.290
the water towers, and yes,
even the colored pipes

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.250
that make it all work.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.000
You see, for 15 years we at
Google have been building

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.960
beautiful powerful data centers.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.950
And all that power is
now at your command.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.650
Make sure you join the Google
Cloud Platform community

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:47.350
on Google+.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.517
And don't forget to come back
here on March 25 for an event

00:02:50.517 --> 00:02:52.100
that you're not going
to want to miss.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.710
My name is Colt McAnlis.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.260
Now, go build something great.
