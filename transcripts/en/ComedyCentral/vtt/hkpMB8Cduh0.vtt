00:00:03.736 --> 00:00:05.371
- Welcome back.

00:00:05.404 --> 00:00:06.773
So throughout the season

00:00:06.806 --> 00:00:08.875 align:start size:91% position:9%
I shared a lot of
personal stories of my own

00:00:08.908 --> 00:00:10.176
and so I'm very thrilled

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:11.411 align:start size:84% position:16%
to have my own friend
Todd here tonight

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:13.713
because he wants to
share one of his.

00:00:13.746 --> 00:00:16.382
Todd, can you tell us your
experience about coming out?

00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:17.917
- No.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.552
First off all, let me
say out of paranoia

00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:21.621
that I don't want it
to be like my identity

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:23.423 align:start position:0%
but you know this show you talk
a lot about sexuality a lot

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:24.690
so I guess it comes up.

00:00:24.723 --> 00:00:25.925
- Yeah.

00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:29.062 align:start size:81% position:19%
- But the person
I'm with now is very

00:00:30.396 --> 00:00:32.265 align:start size:81% position:19%
he is like how I was
fifteen years ago

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:34.801
so I don't mention his name or
anything but he's really cool

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:36.469
and he's got a cool
beard and he's great.

00:00:37.803 --> 00:00:39.506
(audience laughter)

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.209
- You can tell them.

00:00:43.242 --> 00:00:45.311
Tell, okay say it to me.

00:00:45.344 --> 00:00:48.882
- But, that was locked and
loaded for about an hour.

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:52.552
You know, long story very short

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:53.586
I had a small group
of friends that knew,

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:55.455
all my comedian friends knew,

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:58.191
but then not to get too serious

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:00.726 align:start size:97% position:3%
but there were, there was like
a, it was always happening

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:02.228
but in the news a
lot because there

00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:04.664
were a lot of younger kids
you know killing themselves.

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:06.165
- Yeah.

00:01:06.198 --> 00:01:08.167 align:start size:91% position:9%
And I thought that if I
don't be honest about this

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.304
then it gives validity to
something worth hiding.

00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:12.805
- Right.

00:01:12.838 --> 00:01:14.740 align:start size:97% position:3%
- So I was like, just about
two years ago, you know let me

00:01:14.773 --> 00:01:17.243 align:start size:81% position:19%
just be honest about
it and just come

00:01:17.276 --> 00:01:18.945
and life is just
so much better now

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:21.247
life was good before but
its so much better now

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.149 align:start size:78% position:22%
its so much better
now. You know?

00:01:23.182 --> 00:01:23.816
- Yeah.

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:26.953
(applause)

00:01:26.986 --> 00:01:28.688
- Do you feel like people
treat you differently now

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:32.091 align:start size:84% position:16%
that they know you are
an opening gay man?

00:01:32.124 --> 00:01:33.526
- Watch your mouth.

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:37.063
You know, the only
one thing is that

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:38.464 align:start size:78% position:22%
people will be
like, look at Todd

00:01:38.497 --> 00:01:39.799 align:start size:94% position:6%
he's good at having
parties, he's good at design

00:01:39.832 --> 00:01:42.702
and once they found out,
that I came out, I do,

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:45.138 align:start position:0%
I feel like they're like, I
don't get credit for it anymore.

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:48.541
They're like "well of course,
because he's you know gay."

00:01:48.574 --> 00:01:49.509
I said it.

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:52.211
That, that's just a given.

00:01:52.244 --> 00:01:53.479
- Yes.

00:01:53.512 --> 00:01:55.882
- That everybody gay is
just great at parties,

00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:58.317 align:start size:84% position:16%
has an eye for design
when it not true.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.852
- Yeah

00:01:59.885 --> 00:02:02.288
- Like Nick is straight but
if he, just for the fun of it

00:02:02.321 --> 00:02:04.457 align:start size:84% position:16%
said he was gay,
everybody the next day

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.595 align:start size:91% position:9%
in the comedy world would
go "I had a feeling."

00:02:09.628 --> 00:02:12.064
- Honestly, I had a feeling.

00:02:12.097 --> 00:02:14.367
(applause)

00:02:15.367 --> 00:02:19.172
- Well, there are just still
a lot of preconceived notions

00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:21.174 align:start size:84% position:16%
out there about gay
men so before the show

00:02:21.207 --> 00:02:23.776
we asked our audience to
write down some of theirs.

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:25.011 align:start size:78% position:22%
So we are going
to go through them

00:02:25.044 --> 00:02:25.945 align:start size:81% position:19%
and Todd, I would
love it if you would

00:02:25.978 --> 00:02:27.713
shed some light on these.

00:02:27.746 --> 00:02:30.116 align:start size:91% position:9%
- Yeah and watch me sweat
profusely as I do it.

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:32.685
- I love how fired up
you are about these.

00:02:32.718 --> 00:02:33.886
Okay, So Todd help us Debunk

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:34.554 align:start size:75% position:25%
the junk.
- Bring them on!

00:02:34.587 --> 00:02:36.088
(applause)

00:02:36.121 --> 00:02:37.257
- Here we go.

00:02:40.125 --> 00:02:41.794
Okay Todd.

00:02:43.896 --> 00:02:44.830
Are you ready?

00:02:44.863 --> 00:02:45.765
- Yeah.

00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:47.133
- Gay men are always ready.

00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:47.800
Okay.

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:49.635
- Sorry

00:02:49.668 --> 00:02:50.903
- Just kidding.

00:02:50.936 --> 00:02:52.772
Okay, gay men go
to the gym a lot.

00:02:52.805 --> 00:02:54.040
- Okay, here we go.

00:02:54.073 --> 00:02:56.209
First of all, its
going to change

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:59.512
because gay people didn't
traditionally have children

00:02:59.545 --> 00:03:02.348
when they hit 40 years old
where most people are 30

00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:04.483
would not be going to the
gym because they have kids

00:03:04.516 --> 00:03:06.352 align:start size:97% position:3%
they were at the gym more
because they didn't have kids

00:03:06.385 --> 00:03:09.789 align:start size:78% position:22%
its not in your
DNA, so fuck that.

00:03:09.822 --> 00:03:11.657
- Love that.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.125
That's smart.

00:03:13.158 --> 00:03:16.662
- And as you see, people that
are gay now that have kids

00:03:16.695 --> 00:03:18.764
you're going to see, maybe
a little less at the gym.

00:03:18.797 --> 00:03:21.100
- Gay men all like musicals.

00:03:21.133 --> 00:03:24.103
- Well thats a great one and I
called my friend Daniel today

00:03:24.136 --> 00:03:25.338
and he's not gay, and I go

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:26.639
"Daniel what is there any t-."

00:03:26.672 --> 00:03:28.674
He goes, "Well I
got a gay friend

00:03:28.707 --> 00:03:29.875 align:start size:97% position:3%
"and he doesn't like musicals,
you don't like musicals.

00:03:29.908 --> 00:03:32.411 align:start size:88% position:13%
"I don't like musicals.
So there you go."

00:03:32.444 --> 00:03:33.346
- There we go.

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:34.280
- What about Chicago though?

00:03:34.313 --> 00:03:35.215
They all like Chicago, right?

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:38.351
I mean is it true though

00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:41.887 align:start size:94% position:6%
that gay guys do like
getting their dicks sucked?

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.257
(laughter)

00:03:46.625 --> 00:03:49.128
Because that I don't want to
stereotype but I feel like

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:51.564
- Come on bring them
on, bring them on.

00:03:51.597 --> 00:03:52.531
- Barbra Streisand.

00:03:52.564 --> 00:03:54.033
- What the fuck!

00:03:54.066 --> 00:03:56.335 align:start size:91% position:9%
And just two seconds ago,
one of your producers

00:03:56.368 --> 00:03:58.371 align:start size:91% position:9%
said fuck is the only word
they have to edit out.

00:03:58.404 --> 00:03:59.438
I don't know what else to say.

00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:00.439
- Yeah.

00:04:00.472 --> 00:04:01.641
- I don't like Barbra Streisand

00:04:01.674 --> 00:04:02.575 align:start size:78% position:22%
I'm not saying
she's not talented

00:04:02.608 --> 00:04:04.043
although to tell you the truth

00:04:04.076 --> 00:04:05.645 align:start size:78% position:22%
every ten years
she comes on TV go

00:04:05.678 --> 00:04:07.913 align:start size:84% position:16%
"I'm so afraid to
sing, I'm so afraid."

00:04:07.946 --> 00:04:09.282
I go, you know what, don't!

00:04:10.482 --> 00:04:11.551
Don't, I don't give a shit!

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.622
Oh, oh, no one knows I-

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.257
Go on give me, give me one.

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.493 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Gay men have a
lot of bathroom sex.

00:04:20.526 --> 00:04:23.596
- Okay that is not, that is
the biggest misconception

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:25.865
is gay men versus men.

00:04:25.898 --> 00:04:29.702
Its not gay men, its men, If
women would fuck in bathrooms

00:04:29.735 --> 00:04:31.638
straight men would
fuck it bathrooms.

00:04:33.272 --> 00:04:36.442
Its not the straight men
that are not doing that

00:04:36.475 --> 00:04:37.710
its because they can't.

00:04:37.743 --> 00:04:39.378
- Okay, they are
constantly trying

00:04:39.411 --> 00:04:41.781
to turn straight guys gay.

00:04:41.814 --> 00:04:44.016
- First of all that's men again.

00:04:44.049 --> 00:04:45.284
That's men again.

00:04:45.317 --> 00:04:46.919
Men don't respect sometimes

00:04:46.952 --> 00:04:48.621
because they have
to be the aggressor

00:04:48.654 --> 00:04:50.456
don't respect boundaries.

00:04:50.489 --> 00:04:52.692
So its the same thing
that a straight guy

00:04:52.725 --> 00:04:56.595 align:start size:97% position:3%
would hit on a woman even
though she is giving no signs

00:04:56.628 --> 00:05:00.333 align:start size:84% position:16%
that she likes him,
that's what its about.

00:05:00.366 --> 00:05:01.267 align:start size:78% position:22%
- It's a little
bit like The Sting

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.768
where you are Robert Redford

00:05:02.801 --> 00:05:06.005
and your trying to con
them into fucking you.

00:05:06.038 --> 00:05:06.539
- Exactly.

00:05:06.572 --> 00:05:07.206
- Yes.

00:05:07.239 --> 00:05:08.541
- He gets it.

00:05:08.574 --> 00:05:10.543
- No no, I meant to
go a different way.

00:05:10.576 --> 00:05:12.078
I meant to go a different way.

00:05:12.578 --> 00:05:15.581 align:start size:91% position:9%
- Okay this is a-, they
know about a secret tailor

00:05:15.614 --> 00:05:17.683
that makes their
suits look better?

00:05:17.716 --> 00:05:19.552
- That's, that is true.

00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:20.519
- Okay. That is true.

00:05:20.552 --> 00:05:21.687
- You are right, that is true.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.855
- Alright thank you Todd

00:05:22.888 --> 00:05:25.057 align:start size:84% position:16%
thank you for clearing
some stuff up.

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.593 align:start size:94% position:6%
That's all the time we have
for Debunking the Junk.

00:05:27.626 --> 00:05:29.095
I'd like to thank my friends

00:05:29.128 --> 00:05:31.297
