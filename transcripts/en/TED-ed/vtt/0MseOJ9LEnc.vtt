00:00:01.595 --> 00:00:02.891
TED-Ed team here.

00:00:02.891 --> 00:00:03.999
As you know, we usually post

00:00:03.999 --> 00:00:05.693
animated educator lessons,

00:00:05.693 --> 00:00:07.788
but today we wanted to try something a little different,

00:00:07.788 --> 00:00:10.315
and we need your help to figure out next steps.

00:00:10.315 --> 00:00:12.059
We've recently learned that a large number

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.286
of students that use TED-Ed

00:00:13.286 --> 00:00:15.480
want to know more about career options,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.311
and that they and the teachers and guidance counselors

00:00:17.311 --> 00:00:18.652
that work with them need better tools

00:00:18.652 --> 00:00:20.042
to make that happen.

00:00:20.042 --> 00:00:21.279
We've been busy trying to design

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.691
an interactive series to meet those needs,

00:00:23.691 --> 00:00:25.085
and today we want to share three videos

00:00:25.085 --> 00:00:27.707
that demo how the series could work.

00:00:27.707 --> 00:00:29.473
Each video features four people

00:00:29.473 --> 00:00:30.730
with four different careers

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.501
reading questions submitted by students.

00:00:33.501 --> 00:00:34.828
The answers to those questions

00:00:34.828 --> 00:00:36.943
and follow-up questions can be explored

00:00:36.943 --> 00:00:40.336
choose-your-own-adventure style through annotations.

00:00:40.336 --> 00:00:41.707
For the purposes of the demo,

00:00:41.707 --> 00:00:43.646
we sourced a few questions from students

00:00:43.646 --> 00:00:45.039
and recruited a few TED speakers

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:47.240
and other professionals to answer the questions,

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.125
but those two things were done independently

00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:50.050
of one another.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.311
The idea for the actual series

00:00:51.311 --> 00:00:52.783
is that the next set of videos

00:00:52.783 --> 00:00:54.979
would only feature questions and people

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:57.645
suggested and voted up by you, the viewers.

00:00:57.645 --> 00:00:58.927
So, if you tell us that the next video

00:00:58.927 --> 00:01:01.145
should undoubtedly feature an arachnologist,

00:01:01.145 --> 00:01:02.478
an album art creator,

00:01:02.478 --> 00:01:03.657
a particle physicist,

00:01:03.657 --> 00:01:04.481
and an engineer,

00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:07.590
all giving away their trade secrets for your benefit,

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.525
we'll try our best to make that happen.

00:01:09.525 --> 00:01:11.332
We think this could be a pretty fun series,

00:01:11.332 --> 00:01:13.505
and we look forward to your feedback.

00:01:13.505 --> 00:01:14.864
Enjoy the demo!

00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:19.479
Now for the story of you,

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:20.694
the TED-Ed community,

00:01:20.694 --> 00:01:22.554
your questions about potential careers,

00:01:22.554 --> 00:01:24.838
and the TED speakers and working professionals

00:01:24.838 --> 00:01:27.553
that you nominate to answer those questions.

00:01:27.553 --> 00:01:29.398
It's an interactive show.

00:01:29.398 --> 00:01:32.327
Welcome to "Click Your Fortune."

00:01:36.635 --> 00:01:37.896
"I'm Nate Mook.

00:01:37.896 --> 00:01:40.027
I started, my background is in technology,

00:01:40.027 --> 00:01:44.580
so I used to work in software and the Internet primarily.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.351
Most recently I've been working

00:01:47.351 --> 00:01:49.136
on short documentary films."

00:01:49.136 --> 00:01:50.846
"My name is Jennifer Healey.

00:01:50.846 --> 00:01:54.970
I am a research scientist at Intel Corporation."

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.515
"Gillian Martin Mahers.

00:01:56.515 --> 00:01:58.344
I'm a learning practitioner.

00:01:58.344 --> 00:02:00.254
I work with environment and development

00:02:00.254 --> 00:02:02.140
and sustainable development organizations

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.223
and individuals who are trying to introduce

00:02:04.223 --> 00:02:07.214
more learning into their processes."

00:02:07.214 --> 00:02:08.969
"Tokunbo Ajasa-Oluwa.

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:12.819
I run GoThinkBig, and it's a digital hub

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.827
where we help young people

00:02:14.827 --> 00:02:17.994
get their first foot on the career ladder, basically."

00:02:17.994 --> 00:02:20.650
Each professional will now draw one of your questions

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.599
from the fortune cookie jar.

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.910

Let's see what fortunes await

00:02:36.775 --> 00:02:38.578
this batch of volunteers.

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.362
"What book are you reading right now?"

00:02:42.993 --> 00:02:45.811
"What ideas are you passionate about?"

00:02:46.503 --> 00:02:48.439
"If you were to give a TED Talk,

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:49.908
or you already have,

00:02:49.908 --> 00:02:52.775
what ideas would you present?"

00:02:53.312 --> 00:02:55.041
"Who do you look up to?"

00:02:55.963 --> 00:02:57.699
You may now click any fortune

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:58.826

00:02:58.826 --> 00:03:00.567
and a handful of follow-up questions

00:03:00.567 --> 00:03:02.837
