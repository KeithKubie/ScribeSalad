[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.030
JACK: Very, very special
guest today with us here

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.060
on Main Campus in
building 43 at Google.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.290
This individual who's going
to speak with us today

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.480
is somebody who has
revolutionized medicine

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.440
and health care, both
here in the US and abroad,

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.255
with a 35-year career.

00:00:26.255 --> 00:00:28.577
And we'll hear very soon
about the early part

00:00:28.577 --> 00:00:30.160
of his career, where
he really started

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.009
on a very different track--

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.970
a track that took him
to a lot of new ideas

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.730
that have brought us
to a lot of revolutions

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.930
across cardiac care,
diabetes, and now Alzheimer's

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.870
and other diseases as well.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.600
Our guest today has six
books, all best sellers

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.820
on "The New York Times"
Best Sellers list.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.790
Our guest today graduated from
the Baylor College of Medicine

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.660
and then did his fellowship
at Harvard and Mass General.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.180
Please help me welcome
Dr. Dean Ornish.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.166
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:03.124
DEAN ORNISH: Thank you.

00:01:03.124 --> 00:01:04.700
JACK: Dean, it
really is a pleasure

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.730
to have you here today.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.220
Here at Google, we're
very, very concerned

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.250
about looking at health care
from many different points

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.894
of view.

00:01:13.894 --> 00:01:16.310
You actually chaired-- you
were one of the former chairs--

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.000
of the Google Health Initiative
back in 2007 to 2009,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.080
so you've had--

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.540
DEAN ORNISH: With Adam
Bosworth and Marissa Mayer.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.665
JACK: Yeah, so you've had
a lot of good involvement

00:01:24.665 --> 00:01:26.600
with Google over the years.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.320
Let's actually start
at the beginning.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.376
You're in medical school.

00:01:31.376 --> 00:01:33.500
You're in the first, second
year of medical school,

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.680
and right off the bat,
something is strange about you.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.250
What is strange about you, and
what realization did you have,

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.230
and what study did you conduct--

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.900
even just as a medical student,
right then and there-- that

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.370
led you down this new pathway?

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:47.870
DEAN ORNISH: I have
to say, no one's

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.150
ever asked me a question about
how strange I was early on.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.270
[LAUGHTER] I guess that
would make me Dr. Strange.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.902
JACK: Yes, exactly.

00:01:54.902 --> 00:01:57.360
DEAN ORNISH: The beginning,
actually, was even before that.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.410
It was when I was in college
at Rice University in Houston,

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.880
and I became
suicidally depressed.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.410
And it's a long story,
but I met a swami named

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.040
Swami Satchidananda
who, when I was

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.080
really ready to do myself in--

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.990
because first I felt like I was
an imposter, like I was stupid

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.150
and then somehow managed to fool
people into thinking otherwise.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.691
And now that I was with a bunch
of really smart people-- kind

00:02:16.691 --> 00:02:19.070
of like maybe some people
feel when they come to Google,

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.360
I felt like it was
just a matter of time

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.470
before they figured
out that they had made

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.270
a big mistake in letting me in.

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.954
But I also had a
spiritual vision

00:02:25.954 --> 00:02:27.620
that was really more
than I could handle

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.480
at the time, which
was that nothing

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.940
can bring lasting happiness.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.960
Nothing external can
bring lasting happiness.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.000
And so the
combination of feeling

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.980
like I was never going to amount
to anything, but even if I did,

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.438
it wouldn't matter,
was like, well,

00:02:38.438 --> 00:02:39.710
why don't I just kill myself?

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:40.790
Because people who are
dead look like they're

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:41.990
happy and peaceful.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.050
And I was all set to do
that, but I got so sick--

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.930
I'd run myself down so much
with infectious mononucleosis--

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.204
that my parents
realized I was a mess.

00:02:50.204 --> 00:02:51.120
I went home to Dallas.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.200
And as crazy as this sounds,
as strange as this sounds,

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.560
I wanted to get well enough and
strong enough to kill myself.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.674
But in the meantime,
my older sister,

00:02:59.674 --> 00:03:01.340
who had been a child
of the '60s and who

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.165
had studied with this ecumenical
swami had really helped her.

00:03:04.165 --> 00:03:05.540
And so my parents
decided to have

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.530
a cocktail party for the swami.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.250
Now, in Dallas in 1972,
this was pretty strange,

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.390
as you would say.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.319
And he started off by
saying a little lecture

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.110
in our living room.

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.568
Nothing can bring you lasting
happiness-- which I'd already

00:03:17.568 --> 00:03:19.590
figured out, except I was
ready to do myself in,

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.450
and he was glowing.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.280
I was like, what
am I missing here?

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.314
And he went on to say
what probably sounds

00:03:24.314 --> 00:03:26.480
like a new-age cliche, but
it turned my life around,

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.510
which is that nothing can bring
you lasting peace and happiness

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.430
and health, but it's our nature
to be happy and peaceful.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.430
And our whole culture
teaches us that if we just

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.160
get more stuff-- more money,
more power, more beauty, more

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.710
accomplishment--
then we'll be happy.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.170
And he would say, once
you set up that dynamic--

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.170
that view of the world--

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.753
however it turns
out, you're generally

00:03:44.753 --> 00:03:47.300
going to be miserable, because
until you get it you feel bad.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.680
If someone else gets it
and you don't, then you

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.420
feel really bad.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.130
And it confirms that we
have this very hostile,

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.050
zero-sum game, dog-eat-dog
view of the world.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.140
But even if you get it,
it's great for the moment.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.040
It's very seductive.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.670
I got it.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:59.660
I'm happy.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.390
But invariably, it's
soon followed by--

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:03.290
well, now what?

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.630
It's never enough.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:05.380
Or so what?

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.910
Big deal.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.830
It doesn't really provide
that lasting sense of meaning.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.121
So then we say, well, this
didn't, but maybe that will.

00:04:10.121 --> 00:04:12.365
And one patient years
ago told me-- he said,

00:04:12.365 --> 00:04:14.240
the letdown that comes
from getting something

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.980
that I thought would make
me happy was so great,

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.063
I always make sure I've
got a dozen projects going

00:04:18.063 --> 00:04:20.450
at the same time so I can
immediately shift my attention.

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:21.019
So--

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.660
JACK: So you had
this epiphany moment

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:23.930
just in the college years--

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:24.320
DEAN ORNISH: Yes.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.840
JACK: What led you to decide,
then, to go to medical school?

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.310
DEAN ORNISH: Well, I always
wanted to go to medical school.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.159
Actually, I was going
to be a photographer,

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:32.450
and there was a photographer
named Philippe Halsman who

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.360
did over 100 "LIFE" magazine
covers in the heyday of life.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.725
And I said, I want to be
a photographer like you.

00:04:36.725 --> 00:04:37.880
He said, oh, no, don't
be a photographer.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.754
It's a terrible life.

00:04:38.754 --> 00:04:39.639
Be a doctor.

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:41.180
So then you can take
all the pictures

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.320
you want and you don't have
to worry about pleasing

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.729
an editor and so on.

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:45.770
But I actually always
wanted to be a doctor, too.

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.471
And so I went from not being
able to read the headline

00:04:48.471 --> 00:04:49.970
on a newspaper when
I was in college

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.469
and tell you five minutes later
what it said to doing really

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:54.110
well and graduating
first in my class

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.985
and giving the baccalaureate
and all of that.

00:04:55.985 --> 00:04:59.390
And I say that just to say
how powerful these beliefs are

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.766
for better and for worse
and affecting our lives.

00:05:01.766 --> 00:05:03.140
So when I went to
medical school,

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.420
I was learning how to do bypass
surgery with Michael DeBakey

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.795
the heart surgeon, who was
one of the inventors of bypass

00:05:07.795 --> 00:05:08.570
surgery.

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:09.560
And we cut people open.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.970
We bypass their
clogged arteries.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.440
You tell them they were cured.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.760
And more often than
not, they would go home

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.120
and do all the things that
had caused the problem

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.980
in the first place--

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.320
eat junk food, smoke cigarettes,
not manage stress, not

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.490
exercise.

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.710
And their new bypasses
would clog up,

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.530
and we'd cut them open again,
sometimes multiple times.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.200
So that, for me, became the
metaphor-- the paradigm,

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.020
or the guiding principle that
all of my work for the next 40

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.464
years, which is that--

00:05:31.464 --> 00:05:33.380
instead of literally or
figuratively bypassing

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.252
the problem, let's
treat the cause.

00:05:35.252 --> 00:05:36.710
Sometimes when I
lecture, I'll show

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.050
a cartoon of doctors mopping up
the floor around a sink that's

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.330
overflowing, and no one's
turning off the faucet.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.070
And the idea is that
what we're finding

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.950
is the more diseases
we study, the more

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.872
underlying biological
mechanisms we do research on,

00:05:48.872 --> 00:05:50.330
the more reasons
we have to explain

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.670
why these simple
changes are so powerful

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:54.560
and how quickly
people can get better

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.300
to the degree they
make them at any age.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.630
It's an incredibly powerful
and motivating and empowering

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:00.180
message.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.620
So we were able to
show for the first time

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.370
that heart disease
was reversible,

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.757
that diabetes and high blood
pressure and high cholesterol.

00:06:07.757 --> 00:06:09.340
People get put on
these drugs and they

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:10.610
say, doctor, how long
do I have to take these?

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:11.984
What does the
doctor usually say?

00:06:11.984 --> 00:06:12.610
Forever, right?

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.030
How long do I have
to mop up the floor?

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.654
Well, why don't we
turn off the faucet?

00:06:15.654 --> 00:06:17.500
So we can routinely
reduce or get

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.910
people off of these medications.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.220
We can reverse heart
disease, diabetes.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.380
It turns out, now,
that getting your blood

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.300
sugar down-- half
the population today

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:26.694
is diabetic or pre-diabetic.

00:06:26.694 --> 00:06:28.360
Getting your blood
sugar down with drugs

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.760
doesn't really prevent all
the horrible complications--

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.320
blindness and amputations
and heart attacks

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.642
and impotence and so on.

00:06:34.642 --> 00:06:36.100
Getting it down
with lifestyle, you

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.720
can prevent virtually
all of them.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.120
And the same is true
for prostate cancer.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.495
JACK: But back
then, in the '70s,

00:06:40.495 --> 00:06:42.670
when you first had some
of these realizations,

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:45.940
it was really almost heresy
to say that you could stop,

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.500
let alone reverse,
heart disease.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:47.750
DEAN ORNISH: Oh, yeah.

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.208
JACK: I mean, in
a sense, would you

00:06:49.208 --> 00:06:53.860
say it was a naivete of somebody
just fresh in medical school

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.980
who maybe didn't know better
that gave you that impetus

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.469
to say, hey, I'm going to
try this and see if it works?

00:06:59.469 --> 00:07:01.760
DEAN ORNISH: Yes, that was
definitely a big part of it.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.218
And the other part was-- having
decided not to kill myself,

00:07:04.218 --> 00:07:06.220
I figured, OK, if I'm
going to choose to live,

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.971
I'm going to lead a
really messy life.

00:07:08.971 --> 00:07:10.720
I need to know what's
real and what's not.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.460
I need to find out for myself,
because I didn't really

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.060
trust anyone at that point.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.710
And that means I was going
to make a lot of mistakes.

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:17.080
And I said, I can live
with making mistakes.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.904
In fact, later when
I became a doctor,

00:07:18.904 --> 00:07:21.320
most people on their deathbeds
don't regret what they did.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.940
They generally regret
what they didn't do.

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.350
Because if you do
something and it fails,

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:25.780
then you learn something
really powerful.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.010
And there's a lot
of wisdom that comes

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.110
from making mistakes-- as you
know-- and learning from them.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:30.565
But if you don't try,
then you just don't know.

00:07:30.565 --> 00:07:32.090
So I figure, what's the
worst that could happen?

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:34.480
So I took a year off between
my second and third years

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.270
of medical school, much
to my parents' dismay,

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:38.280
and began this study.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.090
And fools rush in.

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:41.630
I didn't know what
I didn't know.

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:43.520
And so I said, let's try it,
and whatever it turns out,

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.280
we'll learn something.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.990
JACK: But one of your professors
was supportive of it, right?

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:46.270
DEAN ORNISH: Oh, yeah.

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:47.100
They were very supportive.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:48.010
And that was the nice
things about going

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:49.593
to medical school
in Texas, where they

00:07:49.593 --> 00:07:50.860
have this pioneering ethos.

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:52.092
It's a crazy idea.

00:07:52.092 --> 00:07:54.050
It's going to fail, but
you'll learn something.

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:54.640
Go for it.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.605
We'll support it.

00:07:55.605 --> 00:07:57.730
When I went to Harvard,
it's so hierarchical there.

00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:59.470
You have to wait till
you're 40 and work

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:00.910
in someone else's
lab for 10 years

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:02.870
before you even get a chance
to do anything like that.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:04.090
And I remember, by the way--

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:05.530
I mean, things have
changed so much since then.

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:07.113
The idea, even, that
the mind affected

00:08:07.113 --> 00:08:09.070
the body was a crazy idea then.

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:10.922
JACK: So take us through
the four pillars--

00:08:10.922 --> 00:08:12.380
let's start with
the heart program.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:13.840
And it's very similar
for the other programs,

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.590
but let's just start
with the four pillars

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:16.620
that you have now shown.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.640
And I want to talk about
the data in a minute,

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.056
because here at
Google, obviously,

00:08:20.056 --> 00:08:21.730
we're very data-focused.

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:24.100
And what's, I think, very
interesting about your program

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.350
is it's not just, oh,
people are feeling better.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:28.450
Clinically, as you
measure their blood,

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:31.130
as you measure their
biomarkers, through a course

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:34.260
of a 12-week program
doing these four pillars,

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.330
you're actually seeing
the biomarker data

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:38.440
change over time.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.870
So take us through the
four different parts

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:43.659
of how someone can go from
having heart disease, worsening

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:46.570
heart disease, and now
stop it and then begin

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:47.880
to reverse that clinically.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.360
DEAN ORNISH: Yeah, they
not only feel better,

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.193
they are better in every
way we can measure.

00:08:51.193 --> 00:08:53.709
And we're using these
very high-tech, expensive,

00:08:53.709 --> 00:08:56.000
state-of-the-art scientific
measures to prove the power

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.333
of these very simple and
low-tech and low-cost and often

00:08:58.333 --> 00:08:59.516
ancient interventions.

00:08:59.516 --> 00:09:00.890
So we started with
heart disease.

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:02.867
And we found that
in just a month,

00:09:02.867 --> 00:09:04.450
the blood flow to
the heart improves--

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:06.820
using specthalium scans.

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:09.640
There was a 91% reduction of the
frequency of angina, or chest

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.300
pain.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.495
Most people who couldn't
walk across the street

00:09:12.495 --> 00:09:14.620
without getting pain or
make love with their spouse

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.170
or play with their kids or go
back to work, within a week,

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:18.280
are pain-free.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.900
And it wasn't just
a placebo response,

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.941
because the heart was
actually getting more blood

00:09:21.941 --> 00:09:22.907
in ways we can measure.

00:09:22.907 --> 00:09:24.490
We then did a
randomized trial, and we

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:27.149
found after just 3 and 1/2
weeks, the ability of the heart

00:09:27.149 --> 00:09:28.690
to pump blood
improved-- using a test

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:32.350
called radionuclide
ventriculography.

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:35.680
After my medical training, we
did the most definitive study

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.912
using cardiac Positron
Emission Tomography, or PET,

00:09:38.912 --> 00:09:40.370
to measure blood
flow to the heart.

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:42.640
And we found a 400%
improvement in blood flow

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.710
compared to the
randomized control group.

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:47.020
And quantitative arteriography
to measure the blockages

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.020
in the arteries, and we
found that they actually

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.010
got less clogged after
one year, and even more

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:52.090
improvement after five years--

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:53.140
JACK: And again,
Dean, this is all

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:55.480
without pharmaceutical
or surgical intervention?

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.060
DEAN ORNISH: That's right.

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:56.790
The program is--

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:58.930
JACK: So give us the four
pillars of this program.

00:09:58.930 --> 00:09:59.860
DEAN ORNISH: And
it's been the same

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:01.880
in all of these programs, which
I'll talk about in a moment.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.820
It's basically a whole
foods, plant-based diet

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:06.270
that's naturally low in fat
and refined carbs or sugar.

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:07.840
It's not low fat
versus low sugar.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.280
It's really both.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:09.780
And also--

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:10.890
JACK: Would you say
it's-- on the diet side,

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:13.510
would you say it's close to the
Mediterranean-oriented diet,

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:15.440
or how should people
think about the diet?

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.564
DEAN ORNISH: It's fruits,
vegetables, whole grains,

00:10:17.564 --> 00:10:20.109
legumes, soy products in their
natural, unrefined forms.

00:10:20.109 --> 00:10:20.900
So that's the diet.

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.050
The exercise is walking
a half an hour a day

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:24.670
or an hour three times a week.

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:27.359
Various meditation
and yoga techniques,

00:10:27.359 --> 00:10:28.650
which has been great at Google.

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:28.960
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:29.840
JACK: The third is meditation.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:30.110
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:30.880
DEAN ORNISH: That's right.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.760
JACK: You'll be happy to know we
have meditation rooms in almost

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:32.970
every building, so, yeah.

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:33.910
DEAN ORNISH: I know,
and I love that.

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:36.160
And that was one of the
things we did back in the day

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.257
when we were running
Google Health--

00:10:38.257 --> 00:10:40.090
that and trying to make
healthier food here,

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:41.500
which was fun.

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:44.354
And the fourth is what we call
psychosocial support, which

00:10:44.354 --> 00:10:45.520
is really love and intimacy.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.320
Or if you reduce it
down even further,

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:50.780
it's eat well, move more,
stress less, love more.

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:51.730
That's it, boom.

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:55.120
And the more diseases we study
and the more mechanisms we

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.120
look out, the more we find that
these same lifestyle changes

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.410
have impacts--

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:00.850
to the degree people make them.

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:03.340
We've found it to reverse heart
disease, diabetes, prostate

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.151
cancer, change your
gene expression,

00:11:05.151 --> 00:11:06.150
lengthen your telomeres.

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:07.040
JACK: Now, I want to get
to genes in a second.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.331
But first, I want to drill in--

00:11:08.331 --> 00:11:10.210
I think all of us
would really understand

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:12.820
that changing your diet,
moving more-- yeah,

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.480
definitely would have an impact
on the physiological self.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.140
But let's drill
into the second two.

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:21.070
Let's talk more
about how meditation,

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:25.180
these mindfulness
exercises, really

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:27.244
affect the physiological.

00:11:27.244 --> 00:11:27.910
And talk to us--

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:30.160
I think there was a Canadian
study called InterHealth.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.160
There's other studies that
you've cited and been part of

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.140
and leading over
the years showing

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:38.910
the physiological impact of
something like meditation.

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:40.330
Let's talk about
meditation first,

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:43.376
then let's move to the social
impact of friend circles

00:11:43.376 --> 00:11:44.250
and things like that.

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:45.708
DEAN ORNISH: Yeah,
well, meditation

00:11:45.708 --> 00:11:48.880
is a powerful way of bringing
your mind to one focus.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.982
And when that happens,
your fuse gets longer,

00:11:51.982 --> 00:11:53.440
for lack of a better
way to put it.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.180
Some people say things
like, I've got a short fuse

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:56.060
and I explode easily.

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:57.500
Well, your fuse gets longer.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:58.986
Things don't bother you as much.

00:11:58.986 --> 00:12:00.610
And when you're under
stress, your body

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:02.120
goes through the fight
or flight response.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.560
So all of your
arteries constrict.

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.020
Your blood pressure goes up.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:06.622
Your eyes dilate.

00:12:06.622 --> 00:12:08.580
These are things that
are designed to help you.

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:11.157
If a mythical saber tooth tiger
jumps out in front of you,

00:12:11.157 --> 00:12:13.240
you want your arteries to
constrict and your blood

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.910
to clot faster, for example,
because if you get bitten,

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:17.320
you don't bleed as quickly.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:21.027
But we've evolved to deal with
these intermittent stresses.

00:12:21.027 --> 00:12:22.360
So you're walking in the jungle.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.219
The tiger jumps out.

00:12:23.219 --> 00:12:25.510
Either you run away from the
tiger, you kill the tiger,

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:25.990
it eats you.

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:26.950
But one way or the
other, it's over.

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:27.560
JACK: But it's done.

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:28.774
It's not a continual-- yeah.

00:12:28.774 --> 00:12:30.940
DEAN ORNISH: Today, it's
just chronic and relentless

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:32.150
throughout the day.

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:34.990
And so these same mechanisms
that have evolved to protect us

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:37.120
can harm us, or even
kill us, because it's not

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.500
just the arteries in
your arms and legs

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.535
that can go into spasm or blood
clots that can form there.

00:12:40.535 --> 00:12:42.040
It can form in your
heart and cause

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:44.350
a heart attack, or in your
brain and cause a stroke.

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:48.160
So anything that can
manage stress better--

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.750
virtually every illness
has been found to--

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:53.470
you're more likely to have it
if you're under chronic stress.

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:56.770
And the other side of that
is the social factors.

00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:59.410
One of the real radical shifts
in our culture in the last 50

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:01.743
years has been the breakdown
of the social networks that

00:13:01.743 --> 00:13:04.150
used to give people a sense
of connection and community.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.809
50 years ago, most people
had an extended family

00:13:06.809 --> 00:13:07.600
they saw regularly.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.030
They had a neighborhood with two
or three generations of people

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:10.946
that grew up together.

00:13:10.946 --> 00:13:12.532
They had a job that
felt secure they'd

00:13:12.532 --> 00:13:13.740
been at for 10 years or more.

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.620
They had a church or
synagogue they went to.

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:17.619
And today, most people
don't have any of those--

00:13:17.619 --> 00:13:18.610
maybe one.

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:20.179
And we know that
those things affect

00:13:20.179 --> 00:13:21.970
the quality of our
lives, but they actually

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:23.050
affect our survival.

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:24.480
And to a much larger degree--

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.813
one of the books I wrote was
called "Love and Survival,"

00:13:26.813 --> 00:13:27.900
back in 1998.

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:29.340
And it reviewed what were
then hundreds-- and now

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:31.006
literally thousands--
of studies showing

00:13:31.006 --> 00:13:34.110
that people who are lonely
and depressed and isolated

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:36.610
are three to 10 times more
likely to get sick and die

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:38.790
prematurely from pretty
much everything than those

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:41.060
who have a sense of love
and connection to community.

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:41.230
So I think--

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:43.330
JACK: And one of the
studies, also, that you cite

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.720
looks at predictors based
in high school and college

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.790
years of prediction of health
over this 40-year period.

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:51.700
And it was the social
bonds, actually,

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.980
that were very much
determining a lot

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:55.340
of that health over many years.

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:55.580
DEAN ORNISH: That's right.

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:57.570
They also did a study at
Harvard Medical School

00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:58.944
where they gave
one questionnaire

00:13:58.944 --> 00:14:01.990
to a group of Harvard students
and said to rate how close they

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:03.710
were with their parents.

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:07.714
30 years later, only
15% of the people

00:14:07.714 --> 00:14:09.130
that were close
with their parents

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:11.459
had chronic diseases in
midlife, and yet the majority

00:14:11.459 --> 00:14:12.500
of those who weren't did.

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.380
Now, you might say, well,
how could one questionnaire

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:14.879
do that?

00:14:14.879 --> 00:14:16.130
Well, how you--

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:17.020
JACK: So note to the
audience-- everyone

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:17.850
should call their
parents after this.

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:18.750
OK.

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:20.717
DEAN ORNISH: So
intimacy is healing.

00:14:20.717 --> 00:14:22.550
Anything that brings
us together is healing.

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:25.090
Even the word healing comes
from the root to make whole.

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:27.320
Yoga is from the Sanskrit
to yoke, to unite,

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.450
to bring together, union.

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:30.430
These are really,
again, old ideas.

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:33.640
And so when we have that
sense of love and connection

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:36.430
and community, it
not only improves

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:38.882
the quality of our lives,
it improves our survival.

00:14:38.882 --> 00:14:40.840
More than any other
factor-- more than smoking,

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:41.830
more than anything.

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:43.240
And it also
interacts with those.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.730
People are more
likely to abuse them--

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:47.230
we tend to say--

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:50.060
at Google, there's this--

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:53.050
we are drowning in
information, which is awesome.

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:55.130
I just love, because I
can just pick out anything

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:56.620
anytime I need it in Google.

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:58.609
But information is not
enough for most people

00:14:58.609 --> 00:14:59.650
to change their behavior.

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:00.850
I mean, if it were,
nobody would smoke.

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:03.010
It's not like you go, hey, Jack,
I want you to quit smoking.

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:03.550
It's really bad for you.

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:05.440
JACK: Right, the rational
argument itself does not

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:06.370
seem to be sufficient.

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:06.640
DEAN ORNISH: Yeah.

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:08.020
If I say, Jack, I want
you to quit smoking.

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:08.630
It's bad for you.

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:09.304
I didn't know.

00:15:09.304 --> 00:15:09.970
I'll quit today.

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:10.895
Everybody knows
it's bad for you.

00:15:10.895 --> 00:15:12.270
It's on every pack
of cigarettes.

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:13.919
But so then I ask,
why do you smoke?

00:15:13.919 --> 00:15:14.710
Why do you overeat?

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:15.793
Why do you drink too much?

00:15:15.793 --> 00:15:17.150
Why do you abuse yourself?

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:19.210
And I used to ask
patients in our studies,

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:20.070
because we got to
know each other.

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:20.870
I'd say, teach me something.

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:21.610
Why do you do these things?

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:22.651
They seem so maladaptive.

00:15:22.651 --> 00:15:24.030
And they say, you don't get it.

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:25.030
They're not maladaptive.

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:26.488
They're very
adaptive, because they

00:15:26.488 --> 00:15:28.660
help us deal with our
loneliness, our depression.

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:30.580
They say things like,
I've got 20 friends

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:32.380
in this pack of cigarettes, and
they're always there for me,

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:33.130
and nobody else is.

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:34.430
You're going to take
away my 20 friends?

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:35.679
What are you going to give me?

00:15:35.679 --> 00:15:38.470
Or food fills that void,
or alcohol or opioids

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:40.150
numb the pain, or
working all the time

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:42.399
is a more socially acceptable
way of numbing the pain,

00:15:42.399 --> 00:15:43.704
or video games or whatever.

00:15:43.704 --> 00:15:46.120
So we've learned that it's not
enough to give information.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.865
It's not enough to
focus on the behavior.

00:15:47.865 --> 00:15:49.490
We need to deal with
the deeper issue--

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:51.646
the loneliness, the
depression, the pain.

00:15:51.646 --> 00:15:53.770
And so we create support
groups that are not really

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:55.705
designed to help people
stay on the diet.

00:15:55.705 --> 00:15:57.580
They're designed to
create a safe environment

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:00.940
to recreate what people had 50
years ago-- a safe environment.

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:02.130
I mean, right now--

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:04.320
social networking was
supposed to really bring us

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.550
all together.

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:08.996
Facebook has, what,
1.6 billion people?

00:16:08.996 --> 00:16:11.370
But it actually has, often,
a way of making you feel more

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:13.915
lonely and more isolated,
because most people don't--

00:16:13.915 --> 00:16:16.290
if you grow up in a family
with two or three generations,

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:18.049
they know where you messed up.

00:16:18.049 --> 00:16:19.590
And you know that
they know, and they

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:21.210
know you know that they
know, and they're still there

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:21.390
for you.

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:22.880
And there's something
really primal about that.

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:24.415
JACK: There was an analysis
called "Bowling Alone"--

00:16:24.415 --> 00:16:25.830
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:27.480
JACK: --which is all about how--

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.480
'50s and '60s, there were
these bowling leagues,

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.979
and people had their shirts and
they had their bowling ball.

00:16:31.979 --> 00:16:33.060
They had the initials.

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:36.386
My dad has a bowling ball
still with his initials on it,

00:16:36.386 --> 00:16:38.010
and he had a bowling
league growing up.

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:38.850
DEAN ORNISH: So that's why.

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:40.890
JACK: But now we're, quote,
"bowling alone," because we

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:42.080
don't have those types of--

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:42.220
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:43.950
DEAN ORNISH: Yeah, or you look
at someone's Facebook profile

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:45.360
or their Facebook feed,
and it looks like they

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:45.990
have the perfect life.

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:46.940
And it's like, why don't I?

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:48.481
Or their bio sketch,
they look great.

00:16:48.481 --> 00:16:50.800
They don't talk about all
the things they've messed up.

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.770
And so in our support groups,
we just create an environment

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:54.870
and say, look, let down
your emotional defenses.

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:56.550
Just talk openly and
authentically about

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:58.740
what's really going on
in your life without fear

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:00.114
that someone's
going to judge you

00:17:00.114 --> 00:17:02.140
or criticize you or
give you glib advice.

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.220
So somebody might say, I may
look like the perfect dad,

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:06.974
but my kid's on
whatever-- some drug.

00:17:06.974 --> 00:17:08.849
And instead of someone
else saying, oh, well,

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:10.349
why don't you send them
to a drug rehab program--

00:17:10.349 --> 00:17:11.819
like they hadn't thought
of that-- it's like,

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:13.470
what feeling does
that evoke in you?

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:14.977
And share it as a feeling.

00:17:14.977 --> 00:17:16.310
Oh, I'm really sad to hear that.

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:17.852
Or gosh, my kids
have other problems,

00:17:17.852 --> 00:17:19.643
or I used to have a
drug problem, whatever.

00:17:19.643 --> 00:17:21.300
Suddenly, it doesn't
fix the problem,

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:23.940
but it fixes the loneliness and
the shame and the isolation.

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:26.730
It's the part of my program
that most people have the most

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:27.710
apprehension about.

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:29.910
Most people think it's
all diet, and it's not.

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:32.850
But also, it's the part that's
invariably the most meaningful.

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:36.144
And we have people that were
in our study 30 years ago--

00:17:36.144 --> 00:17:37.060
they're still meeting.

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:38.880
And they didn't like each other
when they first got together.

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.060
They just happened to
be going to the cath lab

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:41.170
at the same time.

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:43.170
Because that need for
connection and community

00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:45.330
is a primal,
fundamental human need.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.580
And even if you've just
scratched the surface of that,

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:50.630
you can create a Facebook or
a multibillion-dollar company.

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:54.090
So whatever people out here
are doing in the world,

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:55.560
to the degree that
you can create

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.352
real, authentic
connections between people,

00:17:57.352 --> 00:17:59.768
it's going to be that much
more successful, and ultimately

00:17:59.768 --> 00:18:00.970
that much more healing.

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:02.910
JACK: So Dean, let's
talk about genetics now.

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:05.640
What's interesting is,
again, people often

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.650
think of genetics as
something hereditary.

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:11.850
I have what my parents gave me,
and that's what I'm stuck with.

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:14.400
But what you've shown is
that these kinds of lifestyle

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.780
changes--

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:18.030
not only, again, the
diet and the exercise,

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:21.180
but the stress reduction
with meditation, the bonds--

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:23.850
are actually changing the
expression of the genes.

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:27.600
And so across 500 genes, both
in terms of up-regulating good

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.362
ones and down-regulating
bad ones--

00:18:29.362 --> 00:18:30.820
we'll get to
telomeres in a second,

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:32.640
but let's just talk about
those kind of studies

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.870
that you've been involved
with where you've shown--

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:39.390
again, with actual
sequencing-- to show

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:42.114
that the genetic
expression has changed

00:18:42.114 --> 00:18:43.280
with these kinds of changes.

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:43.860
DEAN ORNISH: Well, just that.

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:46.200
I mean, so often, people say
to me, oh, I've got bad genes.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:46.783
What can I do?

00:18:46.783 --> 00:18:48.720
In fact, Bill Clinton
is a good example.

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.407
When his bypasses clogged
up, one of his doctors

00:18:51.407 --> 00:18:52.365
had a press conference.

00:18:52.365 --> 00:18:53.520
He said, oh, it's
all in his genes.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.350
His lifestyle had
nothing to do with it.

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:56.490
So I sent him a note,
and I said, actually,

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:58.031
it has everything
to do with it-- not

00:18:58.031 --> 00:18:59.120
to blame, but to empower.

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:00.630
Because if it's all in your
genes, you're a victim.

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:01.580
What can you do?

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:02.310
I said, you're not a victim.

00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:04.120
You're one of the most
powerful guys in the world.

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.425
And so he began
making these changes,

00:19:05.425 --> 00:19:07.030
and he's still doing it
now, nine years later,

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:08.370
which I think sets a
great example, whatever

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:10.432
your politics, when a
former president who

00:19:10.432 --> 00:19:12.390
was known for not eating
particularly healthily

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:13.290
does that.

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:16.376
But we found that, again, it's
another example of how dynamic

00:19:16.376 --> 00:19:17.250
these mechanisms are.

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:19.860
In just three months, we found
over 500 genes were changed.

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:21.729
As you say, up-regulating
the healing genes

00:19:21.729 --> 00:19:22.770
and down-regulating the--

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:24.660
JACK: So three months
of change in lifestyle?

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:25.620
DEAN ORNISH: 501 genes.

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:26.310
JACK: 500 genes.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:27.990
DEAN ORNISH: And we published
this with Craig Venter

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:30.471
in the "Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences,"

00:19:30.471 --> 00:19:32.220
and we particularly
down-regulated chronic

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.750
inflammation-- genes that
cause chronic inflammation--

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:37.109
oxidative stress, and what
are called the RAS oncogenes

00:19:37.109 --> 00:19:39.150
that promote prostate,
breast, and colon cancer--

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:40.260
just like that.

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:41.981
Again, it's amazing
how dynamic people

00:19:41.981 --> 00:19:44.230
can get better or worse when
they make these lifestyle

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:44.749
changes.

00:19:44.749 --> 00:19:46.290
JACK: Let's talk
about telomeres now.

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:48.494
Talk to us-- you've been
interacting with one

00:19:48.494 --> 00:19:50.535
of the founders of the
whole telomeric medicine--

00:19:50.535 --> 00:19:51.664
DEAN ORNISH: Liz Blackburn.

00:19:51.664 --> 00:19:52.330
JACK: --science.

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:54.797
Liz Blackburn-- won
the Nobel Prize.

00:19:54.797 --> 00:19:56.880
Talk to us about what are
telomeres, first of all,

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.880
for those in the YouTube
land who may not know yet?

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:03.810
And what findings
did you show in terms

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:05.460
of the impact of
these kind of changes

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:06.915
on telomeres themselves?

00:20:06.915 --> 00:20:09.000
DEAN ORNISH: Well,
telomeres are--

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.760
the analogy that Liz
Blackburn often gives

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.800
is they're like plastic tips
on the ends of your shoelace

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.383
to keep your shoelace
from unraveling.

00:20:14.383 --> 00:20:16.260
They keep your DNA
from unraveling.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.725
And as we get older, our
telomeres tend to get shorter.

00:20:18.725 --> 00:20:20.100
And as our telomeres
get shorter,

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.350
our lives get shorter, and
the risk of premature death

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:25.360
from heart disease, diabetes,
most forms of cancer,

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.600
Alzheimer's, goes up
proportionate to that.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.380
Now, she had done
an amazing study

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:31.380
with Elissa Epel where
they found that women who

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:32.820
are under chronic
emotional stress

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:35.130
because they were
caregivers of either parents

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:36.750
with Alzheimer's or
kids with autism--

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:38.820
the more stress they
felt and the longer

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:41.075
they felt that way, the
shorter their telomeres were.

00:20:41.075 --> 00:20:42.700
And they calculated
that the difference

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.241
between the high
and low-stress women

00:20:44.241 --> 00:20:50.550
was nine years in terms of--
excuse me, 17 years in terms

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:51.584
of longevity.

00:20:51.584 --> 00:20:53.250
But what was even
more interesting to me

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:56.010
is that it wasn't
an external cause.

00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:57.427
It was how the
women were reacting

00:20:57.427 --> 00:20:59.593
to it that determined its
effect on their telomeres.

00:20:59.593 --> 00:21:01.690
In other words, even if
you're in a bad situation,

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:03.497
you can mitigate and
modulate that by doing

00:21:03.497 --> 00:21:05.580
the kinds of things we're
talking-- by meditating,

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:07.140
by eating healthily,
by exercising,

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:09.692
by having social support.

00:21:09.692 --> 00:21:11.400
And so I thought,
well, OK, if bad things

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:12.517
make your genes shorter--

00:21:12.517 --> 00:21:14.100
I mean, your telomeres
shorter-- maybe

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:15.436
good things make them longer.

00:21:15.436 --> 00:21:17.310
So we did a study
together, and we found that

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:19.035
after just three
months, the telomerase--

00:21:19.035 --> 00:21:20.910
which we published in
"The Lancet Oncology"--

00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:22.542
increased by 30%.

00:21:22.542 --> 00:21:24.000
And after five
years, the telomeres

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.583
got 10% longer, whereas they got
shorter in the control group.

00:21:26.583 --> 00:21:28.290
It's still the
only control study

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:30.039
showing that any
intervention can actually

00:21:30.039 --> 00:21:31.165
make your telomeres longer.

00:21:31.165 --> 00:21:33.122
And when "The Lancet"
sent out a press release,

00:21:33.122 --> 00:21:35.380
they called it "Reversing
Aging at a Cellular Level,"

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:36.542
which I think is true.

00:21:36.542 --> 00:21:39.000
And so many of these things
that we think are in our genes,

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.625
we really have a lot
more control over.

00:21:40.625 --> 00:21:42.820
Again, not to blame,
but to empower.

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:46.120
JACK: So let's talk about the
medical establishment itself.

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.120
You've had a deep
engagement there.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.340
What's great is that you
went through med school.

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:53.780
You went to Harvard for
fellowship, Mass General.

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:56.470
And so you're deeply familiar
with the core establishment.

00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:58.140
And in fact, you've
been invited, now--

00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:00.390
over the past number of
years, particularly--

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:02.940
to some of the key
establishments to give

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:05.265
rounds, to actually
describe your science.

00:22:05.265 --> 00:22:07.440
So no longer is
it something like,

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.910
what is Dean doing over there?

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:10.790
You're now inside
the Cleveland Clinic.

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:12.190
You're inside Mass General.

00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:13.770
You're inside these areas.

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:16.260
Yet, if you look at the
curriculum of med school,

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:20.250
if you ask most doctors till
today how they were trained

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:21.960
and how they're
being trained, we

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.787
don't see enough of
the kind of science

00:22:23.787 --> 00:22:24.870
that you're talking about.

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:28.800
Again, not just feel-good stuff,
but core science and impact.

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:31.200
What will it take, or
what do you recommend

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.140
as a prescription, as it
were, to the med schools--

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:36.910
as you talk to deans of med
schools around the country--

00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:38.492
what do we need to do?

00:22:38.492 --> 00:22:40.450
DEAN ORNISH: Well, it's
a really good question.

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:42.991
I used to think if we just had
good science that would change

00:22:42.991 --> 00:22:44.580
medical practice and education.

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:46.621
And to some degree it did,
but not nearly as much

00:22:46.621 --> 00:22:47.197
as I thought.

00:22:47.197 --> 00:22:49.530
What I finally learned-- and
I learned this the hard way

00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:50.937
when--

00:22:50.937 --> 00:22:53.520
I started a nonprofit institute
called The Preventive Medicine

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:55.140
Research Institute,
and we've been

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:57.264
training hospitals and
clinics and physician groups

00:22:57.264 --> 00:22:59.550
around the country and
doing research and so on.

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:01.260
And so through that,
in the early '90s,

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:04.230
we trained 53 hospitals
around the country.

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:06.326
We got bigger
changes in lifestyle,

00:23:06.326 --> 00:23:08.700
better clinical outcomes,
bigger cost savings, and better

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.830
adherence than anyone's ever
shown, and a number of them

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:13.060
closed down because we didn't
have the reimbursement.

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:15.226
So the painful lesson is--
if it's not reimbursable,

00:23:15.226 --> 00:23:16.560
it's not sustainable.

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:17.690
JACK: So you went on
a quest-- an odyssey.

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:18.510
DEAN ORNISH: So I
went on a quest.

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:20.831
JACK: And it took you
what, just a few months?

00:23:20.831 --> 00:23:21.330
Joke.

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:22.371
DEAN ORNISH: Yeah, right.

00:23:22.371 --> 00:23:24.210
It took 16 years, actually.

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:27.096
Because I'd been working
with the Clintons since '93,

00:23:27.096 --> 00:23:28.470
and when he was
president, I also

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:30.420
was working with Newt
Gingrich's daughter,

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:32.530
who had had some health issues.

00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:34.800
And so we had the President
of the United States,

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:37.110
the Speaker of the House,
20 members of the Senate,

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:39.270
30 members of the House-- they
all said, this is a great idea.

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:41.820
And they still took 16 years
to get Medicare to cover it.

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.520
But they did, and I'm really
grateful that they finally did.

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:47.040
JACK: Just to clarify that--
so when people now want to do

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:49.830
these lifestyle changes
of the diet, the exercise,

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:52.500
the stress reduction,
and the bonding--

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:55.210
that program, now,
is now covered?

00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:57.390
Even though-- again,
highly unusual situation,

00:23:57.390 --> 00:23:59.520
because typically, most
insurance companies want

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:02.734
to cover a pharmaceutical
intervention, a drug,

00:24:02.734 --> 00:24:03.775
a surgical intervention--

00:24:03.775 --> 00:24:04.340
DEAN ORNISH: Or a device.

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:05.120
JACK: --but now they're
going to cover--

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:06.960
they're covering something,
now, that is not that?

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:07.950
DEAN ORNISH: That's
what took 16 years.

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:09.783
And they're covering
it as a Dr. Dean Ornish

00:24:09.783 --> 00:24:11.050
program, which is great.

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:14.980
So we partnered with a company
called Sharecare which is--

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:17.670
excuse me-- Jeff Arnold, who
started WebMD, and Mehmet Oz--

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:20.490
Dr. Oz-- and Don Whaley
and others, and we're

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:23.550
training hospitals, physician
groups, health systems,

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:26.767
and clinics around the country.

00:24:26.767 --> 00:24:29.100
And again, we're getting the
same thing-- bigger changes

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:31.530
in lifestyle, better clinical
outcomes, bigger cost savings,

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:32.040
better [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:33.450
We're also doing these
12-day retreats where

00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:34.860
people can come from anywhere.

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:37.318
And Medicare is paying for it,
and most insurance companies

00:24:37.318 --> 00:24:38.430
are paying for it, too.

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:41.310
And so what I'm learning is that
when you change reimbursement,

00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:43.870
you change medical practice,
and even medical education.

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:44.750
And it is changing.

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:46.440
It's slower than I would like.

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:49.489
It's been 40 years I've
been doing this work.

00:24:49.489 --> 00:24:51.030
The president of
the American College

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:52.620
of Cardiology, last year--

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:59.544
Dr. Kim Williams-- found
that his own LDL cholesterol

00:24:59.544 --> 00:25:00.210
was really high.

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:01.700
Didn't want to go on statins
the rest of his life.

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:02.430
Did a literature review.

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:03.263
Came across my work.

00:25:03.263 --> 00:25:04.290
Went on my program.

00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:05.680
His LDL came down 50%.

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:08.057
Wrote about it in all
the medical literature.

00:25:08.057 --> 00:25:09.390
And at the American College of--

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:10.470
JACK: This is the head
of the American College

00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:11.300
of Cardiology himself--

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:11.890
DEAN ORNISH: That's right.

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:12.780
JACK: OK.

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:14.999
DEAN ORNISH: And he
headed a six-hour seminar

00:25:14.999 --> 00:25:15.915
on lifestyle medicine.

00:25:15.915 --> 00:25:18.630
And lifestyle medicine is using
lifestyle to reverse disease

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:20.370
and to treat it, not
just to prevent it,

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:22.536
which I think is the most
exciting trend in medicine

00:25:22.536 --> 00:25:23.140
today.

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:24.540
And we did a seminar
on lifestyle medicine,

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:26.009
and over 1,000
cardiologists came.

00:25:26.009 --> 00:25:28.050
That wouldn't have happened
five or 10 years ago.

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:31.080
So things are changing, and
it makes me really happy

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:31.710
to see them.

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:33.510
JACK: So we talked
about cardiology.

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:34.690
We talked about diabetes.

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:35.820
Let's talk about cancer.

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:38.370
You've now shown-- you did a
series of studies on prostate

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:40.860
cancer to begin with,
and now, I believe, maybe

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:43.650
on some other cancers-- showing
that, again, these kinds

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:45.612
of non-pharmaceutical
interventions

00:25:45.612 --> 00:25:47.820
did have a powerful effect,
for example, in prostate.

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:48.370
Talk about that study.

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:49.260
DEAN ORNISH: Well,
prostate cancer

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:51.910
is the number one cancer in
men other than skin cancer.

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:54.960
And there was a major study
that came out a year ago

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:57.280
that looked at a 10-year
study of randomized trial--

00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:59.040
in "The New England
Journal of Medicine."

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.373
And what they found is that
men who had the conventional

00:26:01.373 --> 00:26:03.500
treatments-- which were
surgery or radiation--

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:04.958
didn't live any
longer than men who

00:26:04.958 --> 00:26:07.520
did nothing who had
biopsy-proven early-stage

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:08.720
prostate cancer.

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.950
And yet, the complications
of the treatments

00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:14.360
tend to maim guys in the most
horrible and personal ways.

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.580
You're wearing diapers
because you're incontinent,

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:19.790
and you can't have sex because
you're impotent, in many cases,

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:22.500
for no benefit at
huge economic cost.

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:25.760
So I did a collaborative
study with Dr. Peter Carroll,

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:28.730
who's the Chair of Urology at
UCSF, and the late Dr. Peter

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:29.300
Carroll--

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:31.312
excuse me, Bill Fair--
who, at the time,

00:26:31.312 --> 00:26:33.770
was the Chair of Urology at
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer

00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:33.980
Center.

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:35.605
When you're doing
something disruptive,

00:26:35.605 --> 00:26:37.817
it's good to work with
the most respected people,

00:26:37.817 --> 00:26:39.650
because it's easier to
get things published.

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:40.822
People believe it.

00:26:40.822 --> 00:26:43.280
And we did a randomized trial,
and we found that these same

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:44.990
lifestyle changes
could slow, stop,

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:47.420
or reverse the progression
of men who have early-stage

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:48.820
prostate cancer--

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:50.760
just the lifestyle
changes alone.

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.370
So if a guy has a biopsy--

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:54.500
their PSA goes
up, gets a biopsy.

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:57.254
The doctor will invariably say,
you've got prostate cancer--

00:26:57.254 --> 00:26:59.420
if they have it-- and you
need to have it taken out,

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:00.770
or you need to have radiation.

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:02.270
But most guys don't
want to do that,

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:04.250
but they don't want to,
quote, "do nothing."

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:05.660
This idea of watchful waiting--

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:07.201
waiting for something
bad to happen--

00:27:07.201 --> 00:27:09.152
is like sitting under
a sort of Damocles,

00:27:09.152 --> 00:27:10.610
waiting for the
other shoe to drop.

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:11.410
People don't want to do that.

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:13.035
They say, I've got
this cancer growing.

00:27:13.035 --> 00:27:14.580
I've got to do
something about it.

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:16.340
So we give people a
third alternative.

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:19.370
An aggressive-- if you want to
put it in more macho terms--

00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:22.010
nonsurgical, non-pharmacologic
intervention.

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:24.724
And then Dr. Carroll has
developed these algorithms

00:27:24.724 --> 00:27:27.140
where they can monitor people
very carefully and find out,

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:29.480
who is that 1 out of 50 people
who really would benefit

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.010
from surgery or radiation?

00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:32.480
And the others can do this.

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:35.210
And unlike most things, the
only side effects are good ones.

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:36.770
JACK: That's great.

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:38.150
So what is next?

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:40.610
You've done, now,
cardiac, diabetes, cancer.

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:42.540
Now you're thinking about
Alzheimer's as well.

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:43.250
DEAN ORNISH: And by
the way, before I

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:45.250
forget, if it's true
for prostate cancer,

00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:47.249
it'd almost certainly be
true for breast cancer.

00:27:47.249 --> 00:27:51.680
And Dr. Laura Esserman, who
runs the Buck Breast Cancer

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:53.329
Center at UCSF, and
I have been talking

00:27:53.329 --> 00:27:55.370
about doing a study for
a long time to show that.

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:57.275
And I'm quite sure that'll
be the case as well.

00:27:57.275 --> 00:27:58.020
JACK: For breast cancer as well?

00:27:58.020 --> 00:27:58.520
DEAN ORNISH: For
breast cancer as well.

00:27:58.520 --> 00:27:59.490
JACK: Great.

00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:01.700
DEAN ORNISH: So what
we did-- we just

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:04.040
began the first randomized
trial to see if we can

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:05.344
reverse Alzheimer's disease.

00:28:05.344 --> 00:28:07.510
People are more afraid of
Alzheimer's than anything.

00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:09.890
In fact, James Watson-- you
know, Watson and Crick--

00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:11.930
when he had his genome
first sequenced, he said,

00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:14.270
I want to know about everything
except the APOE4 gene,

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:16.230
which is the one that increases
your risk of Alzheimer's.

00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:18.521
Because why would I want to
know if I can't do anything

00:28:18.521 --> 00:28:19.410
about it?

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:21.590
So we think you actually
can do something about it.

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:24.320
I think we're at a place with
respect to Alzheimer's very

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:27.020
much like we were 40 years
ago when I first started doing

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:28.190
research on heart disease.

00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:29.930
There's every reason
to think it'll work.

00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:32.060
There are animal studies,
epidemiological studies,

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:34.142
anecdotal case reports,
randomized trials

00:28:34.142 --> 00:28:36.350
where they use less intensive
lifestyle interventions

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:38.082
that could slow or
stop the progression.

00:28:38.082 --> 00:28:40.040
I think a more intensive
lifestyle intervention

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:41.450
can actually reverse it.

00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:44.570
So we're doing a collaboration
with Dr. Bruce Miller and Joel

00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:47.136
Kaplan at the Memory and Aging
Center at UCSF, who run that.

00:28:47.136 --> 00:28:49.010
And we're going to take
100 men and women who

00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:51.680
have early-to-moderate
Alzheimer's, randomize them

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.690
into two groups, put half on
the program and not the other,

00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:57.140
and compare them using
PET to look at amyloid

00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:59.810
and MRI to look at
hippocampal volume

00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:02.180
and looking at cognitive
function testing and biomarkers

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:03.230
and so on.

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:06.130
And we've raised most of the
money that we need to do this,

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:07.750
so we've already started it.

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:09.380
We just got our IRB
approval last week,

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:10.730
and we're ready to begin.

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:12.410
And I'm cautiously optimistic.

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:16.160
You never know, but I'm pretty
sure this is going to work.

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:18.234
And it runs in my
family, too, so I have

00:29:18.234 --> 00:29:19.400
a personal interest in this.

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.451
And if we could show
that we can reverse

00:29:21.451 --> 00:29:23.450
the progression of
early-to-moderate Alzheimer's

00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:25.116
by changing lifestyle,
that would really

00:29:25.116 --> 00:29:27.410
give millions of people
new hope and new choices.

00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:30.062
Because when you lose your
memories, you lose everything.

00:29:30.062 --> 00:29:32.270
JACK: Particularly as-- in
society, our demographic's

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:32.870
getting older.

00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:33.200
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:33.860
JACK: People age--

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:34.820
DEAN ORNISH: Exactly.

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:37.500
JACK: --and live longer, this
is going to be more prevalent.

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.166
So before we turn to
audience questions,

00:29:39.166 --> 00:29:41.990
let me just ask a very practical
question for folks here,

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:44.227
and also watching on YouTube.

00:29:44.227 --> 00:29:46.310
In terms of the kinds of
things that people should

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:49.310
do, in addition to the
diet, the lifestyle,

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:52.880
meditation, stress reduction,
and the social bonding,

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.777
are there certain--

00:29:54.777 --> 00:29:57.110
in terms of the diet that we
get-- the nutrition we get,

00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:58.100
I want to use-- the
word nutrition may

00:29:58.100 --> 00:29:59.141
be even better than diet.

00:29:59.141 --> 00:30:00.997
People sometimes confuse
diet for a diet--

00:30:00.997 --> 00:30:01.580
some kind of--

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:02.260
DEAN ORNISH: A way of eating.

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:03.770
JACK: --bizarre regimen.

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:06.200
But the kind of
supplements that people

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:09.230
should think about using or
not thinking about using--

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:12.030
fish oil supplements,
good or bad?

00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:13.966
Mushrooms?

00:30:13.966 --> 00:30:14.840
I don't mean shrooms.

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:15.470
I mean mushrooms.

00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:15.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:17.210
JACK: What are the
kinds of things--

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:18.530
DEAN ORNISH: Actually, there's
some good studies on shrooms,

00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:19.030
as well.

00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:21.020
JACK: What are the kinds
of things that people

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:22.344
should or should not consider?

00:30:22.344 --> 00:30:23.760
DEAN ORNISH: Before
I answer that,

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.290
let me say one thing
that I forgot to mention,

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:27.456
which is that with all this
interest in personalized

00:30:27.456 --> 00:30:29.782
medicine, it's the same
lifestyle program that we found

00:30:29.782 --> 00:30:30.990
could do all of these things.

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:32.750
It can down-regulate
all these mechanisms

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:35.342
that could reverse all
these different conditions.

00:30:35.342 --> 00:30:36.800
And I think it's
because they share

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:38.774
certain common underlying
biological pathways,

00:30:38.774 --> 00:30:41.190
although we tend to silo them
as being different diseases,

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:43.700
they really may be more
different manifestations

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:46.350
of the same kind of
underlying processes.

00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:49.310
Now, if you're trying to
do a targeted immunotherapy

00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:51.020
for melanoma-- like
you so brilliantly--

00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:52.790
I mean, I don't know if
you know Jack's dad-- is

00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:54.110
it OK to talk about your dad?

00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:54.620
JACK: Sure.

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:56.330
DEAN ORNISH: Jack's
dad developed melanoma.

00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:58.350
Now, most people, when
their dad develops melanoma,

00:30:58.350 --> 00:30:59.474
they go, oh, that's so bad.

00:30:59.474 --> 00:31:00.440
I'm so scared.

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:03.930
Jack, who's not an
oncologist, decided

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:06.430
he would learn everything he
could about melanoma, developed

00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:09.150
a treatment-- an immunotherapy--
and his dad is cured.

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:10.146
So that's Jack.

00:31:10.146 --> 00:31:11.520
JACK: I didn't
develop it myself.

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:13.110
We supported other
people's work.

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:13.950
DEAN ORNISH: Yeah,
but you were the one

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:14.880
who actually directed that.

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:15.980
It wasn't just
giving them money.

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:17.640
It was actually saying,
let's study this.

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:18.598
Let's see what happens.

00:31:18.598 --> 00:31:21.295
It was really your work
that they put into practice.

00:31:21.295 --> 00:31:22.920
So if you're doing
something like that,

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:26.640
I think a targeted immunotherapy
or whatever is brilliant.

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.620
But for the vast majority
of chronic diseases,

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:30.203
it's these same
lifestyle changes that

00:31:30.203 --> 00:31:31.650
can prevent and reverse them.

00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:33.040
And it's not all or nothing.

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:34.320
I wrote a book called
"The Spectrum," which

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:36.487
was based on the finding
that in all of our studies,

00:31:36.487 --> 00:31:38.736
the more you change, the
more you improve in every way

00:31:38.736 --> 00:31:39.390
we can measure.

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:40.860
So if you have a
life-threatening illness,

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:41.850
that's more of
the pound of cure.

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:43.360
You really do have
to make big changes.

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:45.109
That's why we were the
first to proe that,

00:31:45.109 --> 00:31:46.870
because most people
didn't go far enough.

00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:48.690
But if you're otherwise healthy,
if you indulge yourself one

00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:49.830
day, eat healthier the next.

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:51.390
If you don't have time
to exercise one day,

00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:52.473
do a little more the next.

00:31:52.473 --> 00:31:53.880
You get the idea.

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:56.460
In terms of supplements,
the ones that I take--

00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:58.330
I take fish oil every day.

00:31:58.330 --> 00:32:01.470
I think in general, it's better
to get your nutrients from

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:04.357
food, but I think Omega-3s
may be an exception to that

00:32:04.357 --> 00:32:05.940
if you're going to
eat fish, because--

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:06.870
JACK: I guess
that's my question.

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:09.286
In other words, it's obviously
better to get it from food,

00:32:09.286 --> 00:32:12.510
but what is available
to us in the average--

00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:14.850
even organic--
grocery, what do you

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:17.310
feel is missing from
that general availability

00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:19.230
that we may want to
think about [INAUDIBLE]??

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:20.980
DEAN ORNISH: I think
the Omega-3s and fish

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:22.740
oil are really worth
doing, because there

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:23.970
are no clean fish.

00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:26.880
All fish are contaminated with
either mercury, dioxin, PCBs--

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:28.742
bad stuff in varying degrees.

00:32:28.742 --> 00:32:31.200
But when you take the fish oil,
if you take certain brands,

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.670
they remove all the
bad stuff so you just

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:33.753
have the pure [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:33.753 --> 00:32:35.642
Or you can take the
plankton-based Omega-3s,

00:32:35.642 --> 00:32:38.100
which are vegan, which is really
where the fish get it from

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:39.150
anyway--from eating
the plankton.

00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:41.130
And then you don't get
the bad stuff, either.

00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:44.250
So I think three grams of
fish oil or flaxseed oil

00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:47.890
or a plankton-based Omega-3s
a day are a really good idea.

00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:51.375
I think that depending on--

00:32:51.375 --> 00:32:53.880
I think the probiotics,
actually-- there's a lot of--

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:56.255
we're actually also doing some
studies on the microbiome.

00:32:56.255 --> 00:32:56.860
JACK: The microbiome.

00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:58.080
Let's talk about the
microbiome a second.

00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:58.620
Just describe that.

00:32:58.620 --> 00:32:59.180
DEAN ORNISH: Well,
you know, there

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:00.780
are trillions of
cells in our body

00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:03.090
that we exist in a
homeostasis with,

00:33:03.090 --> 00:33:05.361
and we're just realizing
how powerful those

00:33:05.361 --> 00:33:07.860
are-- and again, how dynamic
you can change your microbiome.

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:08.910
We did a pilot study.

00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:11.580
We found in just three days, we
could show significant changes

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:14.110
in the microbiome in
healing directions.

00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:16.320
So I think for most
people, if you're not

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:18.090
eating a particularly
healthy diet, taking

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:19.464
one of the microbiome
supplements

00:33:19.464 --> 00:33:20.700
can be a good thing.

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:22.470
The Omega-3s we've talked about.

00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:24.570
I think most people
don't get enough vitamin

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:27.420
C in their diets, so taking
500 or 1,000 milligrams of that

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:29.100
is a good idea.

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:31.894
The turmeric-- I know you
like to drink turmeric tea,

00:33:31.894 --> 00:33:32.560
which we share--

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:33.070
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:34.000
JACK: Right here.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.520
Here it is.

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:38.330
DEAN ORNISH: Turmeric is a very
powerful anti-inflammatory.

00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:39.240
This is one of the
reasons why it's

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:41.198
been linked with reducing
Alzheimer's, but also

00:33:41.198 --> 00:33:42.180
other conditions.

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:44.636
Most people aren't going to
drink enough turmeric tea

00:33:44.636 --> 00:33:46.260
or eat it in their
diet-- or curcumin--

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:48.030
so I take a supplement.

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:54.210
It doesn't make you smell like
curry, and those were good.

00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:55.710
So those are the
things that I think

00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:57.060
most people can benefit from.

00:33:57.060 --> 00:33:57.640
JACK: Cool.

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:58.810
Let's turn to the audience.

00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:00.351
Is there questions
from the audience?

00:34:00.351 --> 00:34:01.300
Why don't we start?

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:01.950
You have a question?

00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:03.241
Yeah, let's use the microphone.

00:34:03.241 --> 00:34:07.037
Make sure the microphone's on so
our YouTube audience can hear.

00:34:07.037 --> 00:34:08.120
AUDIENCE: I guess it's on.

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:08.850
JACK: Yes.

00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:11.310
Tell us your name and
what your question is.

00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:12.480
Let's keep your questions
short, because we want

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:13.688
to get a lot of questions in.

00:34:13.688 --> 00:34:14.310
Go ahead.

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:15.726
AUDIENCE: My name
is [INAUDIBLE]..

00:34:15.726 --> 00:34:18.002
Thanks for coming and giving
us this excellent talk.

00:34:18.002 --> 00:34:18.960
DEAN ORNISH: Thank you.

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:21.360
AUDIENCE: My question
is about-- so my dad--

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:24.400
so I'm an Indian, and
my dad lives in India

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:26.429
and he's having heart disease.

00:34:26.429 --> 00:34:32.159
So my question is, how are your
diets mapping to Indian food?

00:34:32.159 --> 00:34:35.550
Because food, as you said,
is a major part of the plan.

00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:37.489
But if the food is--

00:34:37.489 --> 00:34:40.800
so Indian food is typically
pretty [INAUDIBLE]..

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:43.199
But if we move into a
different kind of diet,

00:34:43.199 --> 00:34:46.494
then he will not like it and
he'll probably reject it.

00:34:46.494 --> 00:34:47.396
So how is that going?

00:34:47.396 --> 00:34:49.520
DEAN ORNISH: There are a
couple of doctors in India

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.681
that are offering
my program there.

00:34:51.681 --> 00:34:52.889
And it's working really well.

00:34:52.889 --> 00:34:54.060
They have thousands
and thousands

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:54.929
of people who have gone through.

00:34:54.929 --> 00:34:56.845
But you're right, the
traditional Indian diet,

00:34:56.845 --> 00:34:59.070
even if it's vegetarian,
is generally high in fat

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:02.310
with all the oils
and so on, and also

00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:04.710
generally high in ghee and
butter and things like that,

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:06.572
and saturated fat and so on.

00:35:06.572 --> 00:35:08.280
So there's a lot of
room for improvement.

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:11.130
And for whatever reason,
people of Indian descent

00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:13.410
are usually more
predisposed particularly

00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:15.490
to type II diabetes, and
often to heart disease.

00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:17.832
So these lifestyle changes
are even more important.

00:35:17.832 --> 00:35:19.290
And unfortunately,
what's happening

00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:20.730
in India is happening
in China, is

00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:22.896
happening in most of
the developing world--

00:35:22.896 --> 00:35:25.270
is that they're starting to
eat like us and live like us,

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:27.340
and all too often die like us.

00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:29.910
And 50 or 60 years ago,
heart disease and diabetes

00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:32.490
were really pretty rare
in India and in China.

00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:35.550
And now they're by far the
number one causes of death.

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:37.740
And it's diverting a lot
of precious resources

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:40.150
from things that really do
require drugs, like AIDS, TB,

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:40.692
and malaria--

00:35:40.692 --> 00:35:43.150
the things that can be largely
prevented, or even reversed,

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:44.340
by changing lifestyle.

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:48.624
So copy our successes,
but not our mistakes.

00:35:48.624 --> 00:35:49.290
JACK: Thank you.

00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:50.290
Other questions, please.

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:51.706
AUDIENCE: So I
have two questions.

00:35:51.706 --> 00:35:53.620
JACK: Your name and
then question, please.

00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:54.620
AUDIENCE: My name
is [INAUDIBLE]..

00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:55.257
Two questions.

00:35:55.257 --> 00:35:57.590
So is there some effort to
develop the recipe books for,

00:35:57.590 --> 00:35:58.800
let's say, different
parts of the world?

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.700
So I suppose you'll need like
20 different recipe books

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:01.980
for different parts of India.

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:02.820
DEAN ORNISH: Can you say
it just a little slower?

00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:03.200
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:04.830
[CHUCKLES] So are
there some efforts

00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:07.549
to develop recipe books for the
different parts of the world?

00:36:07.549 --> 00:36:08.340
JACK: Recipe books?

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:08.475
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:08.475 --> 00:36:09.167
JACK: Yeah.

00:36:09.167 --> 00:36:11.250
AUDIENCE: Customized to
the spices and ingredients

00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:13.710
found in different parts
of India, for example?

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:16.560
The second question is, do
you have books or something

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.330
for teenage kids?

00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:20.720
So what are we doing
about teenage kids in USA?

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:21.240
JACK: Teenage kids, yeah.

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:22.290
DEAN ORNISH: Yeah,
yeah, well, we

00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:24.690
don't have anything that's
specific to India for spices.

00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:26.400
But I'd love it if you or
someone like that could--

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:27.450
JACK: We have some recipe books.

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:27.810
But I don't think--

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:28.420
DEAN ORNISH: Oh, we
have [INAUDIBLE]..

00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:30.670
Yeah, there are hundreds of
recipes in all of my books

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:33.387
but nothing specific
to Indian food.

00:36:33.387 --> 00:36:35.220
JACK: So maybe a new
collaboration, I think.

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:36.030
DEAN ORNISH: Yeah, maybe so.

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:37.380
That would be great
if you could do that.

00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:38.460
JACK: How about teenage--

00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:40.380
DEAN ORNISH: I've
got a 17-year-old son

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:43.035
and he was vegetarian until
he hit about 14 or 15.

00:36:43.035 --> 00:36:45.160
And he said, look, Dad,
it's either meat or heroin.

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:45.570
What do you think?

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:46.890
So I said, meat, good choice.

00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:49.500
[CHUCKLES] He had to
rebel in some way.

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:52.020
But when he was younger,
I learned that even

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:54.300
more than being healthy,
whether you're six or 60,

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:56.250
people want to feel
free and in control.

00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:58.470
And he's a pretty
strong-willed kid.

00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:02.500
And Jack has been mentoring him,
which we're very grateful for.

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:05.166
And I knew that if I told him
he couldn't have certain foods,

00:37:05.166 --> 00:37:05.790
he'd want them.

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:07.664
And he'd probably develop
an eating disorder.

00:37:07.664 --> 00:37:11.739
So I said, look, the rule in our
family is nobody can tell you

00:37:11.739 --> 00:37:13.530
what to eat, not even
me, and I'm your dad,

00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:15.240
and I know more about
food than a lot of people,

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:16.350
because it's your body.

00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:18.030
You control it.

00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:19.340
This is why we eat what we eat.

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:20.924
But you decide what
you want to have.

00:37:20.924 --> 00:37:22.590
And so we taught him
how to read labels.

00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:24.870
So he'd go into a store and say,
oh, that has too much of this.

00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:26.370
Or I don't think I
should have that.

00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:28.680
Now that all shifted when
he went through puberty.

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:31.380
But I think that the idea
of empowering your kids

00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:33.330
and teaching them
and if you can help

00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:35.490
them grow food and actually
see where it comes from

00:37:35.490 --> 00:37:37.656
or visit a farm if you don't
want to do it yourself,

00:37:37.656 --> 00:37:38.940
it's magic to them.

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:39.930
And they get their
taste when they're

00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:41.304
younger, their
taste preferences,

00:37:41.304 --> 00:37:42.540
which are really malleable.

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:44.250
So if you tend to
feed them healthy food

00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:46.350
from the beginning, they
begin to actually prefer

00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:47.640
those kinds of foods.

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:50.590
So I haven't read a book yet
like that, but I'd like to.

00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:52.982
But Bill Sears has written
some good books about that.

00:37:52.982 --> 00:37:53.690
JACK: Bill Sears?

00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:54.020
DEAN ORNISH: Yeah.

00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:54.519
JACK: Yeah.

00:37:54.519 --> 00:37:56.970
I think it's so challenging,
because particularly here

00:37:56.970 --> 00:38:00.270
in the US, there's so much
packaged food and even, quote,

00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:02.020
"healthy" packaged food.

00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:04.410
It does make it easier
for a very busy parent.

00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:05.610
You're a busy parent.

00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:06.706
You have lots of kids.

00:38:06.706 --> 00:38:08.580
You're feeding things
like that, and you just

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:10.110
get a lot of packaged food.

00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:13.740
But it is disconnecting us
from the source of the food

00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:14.852
and where things are from.

00:38:14.852 --> 00:38:15.810
DEAN ORNISH: It's true.

00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:18.690
JACK: It's something
that unfortunately

00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:20.359
is a major challenge that--

00:38:20.359 --> 00:38:22.650
DEAN ORNISH: Well, to the
extent at least the meal kits

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:24.459
or whatever can be used to--

00:38:24.459 --> 00:38:27.000
the meal kits are different than
the frozen foods, and so on,

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.050
because you're
actually making dinner.

00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:29.360
But they just have
done the hard part.

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:30.540
So it makes it easier.

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:32.400
And there are studies that show
that just when the family sits

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:34.900
down together to have a meal
together, just the sitting down

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:38.340
together, there's better
academic performance, lower

00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:41.719
truancy, lower illness, all the
kind of things that you want.

00:38:41.719 --> 00:38:44.010
Again, it goes back to the
social factors and the power

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:45.520
of community and family.

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:46.020
JACK: Great.

00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:47.019
Other questions, please.

00:38:47.019 --> 00:38:49.190
Your name?

00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:50.960
AUDIENCE: Hi, my
name is [INAUDIBLE]..

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:53.300
My question is about
what are the things

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:56.990
we can adopt and encourage
that can help build a stronger

00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:58.920
immunity against diseases.

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:00.255
JACK: Stronger immunity, yeah.

00:39:00.255 --> 00:39:02.120
DEAN ORNISH: Well, one of the
most powerful things you can do

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:04.290
is to actually have more love
in your life, believe it or not.

00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:06.800
There was a study that was
done by Sheldon Cohen that

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:08.660
was in the "Journal of the
American Medical Association."

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:11.076
And I don't know how he got
this through the Institutional

00:39:11.076 --> 00:39:12.860
Review Board, but
he got volunteers.

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:18.320
And he dripped rhinovirus that
causes colds in their noses.

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:20.000
100% of them got infected.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.670
But not everybody that got
infected actually got sick.

00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:25.270
And they found that the
more social contacts

00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:27.020
they had-- the more
friends visiting them,

00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:28.478
the more phone
calls, the more love

00:39:28.478 --> 00:39:30.862
that they had-- they had
four times fewer signs

00:39:30.862 --> 00:39:33.320
and symptoms of a cold, even
though they were all infected.

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:37.070
So [INAUDIBLE] is we have
this idea that the bacteria

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:39.590
or the germ causes the disease.

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:41.780
But it's a necessary but
not always sufficient

00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:43.425
factor, even with
people who are--

00:39:43.425 --> 00:39:46.790
Margaret Chesney did a study at
UCSF where she found that men

00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:51.170
and women who were HIV-positive
who were lonely and depressed

00:39:51.170 --> 00:39:53.760
were more than twice as likely
to develop AIDS and die from it

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:54.980
than those who weren't.

00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:56.224
So diet is important.

00:39:56.224 --> 00:39:57.140
Exercise is important.

00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:59.140
These all affect our
immunity, but probably more

00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:00.641
than anything, these
social factors.

00:40:00.641 --> 00:40:03.140
And we tend to think that the
time we spend with our friends

00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:05.030
and family is a luxury
that we do after we've

00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:06.332
done the important stuff.

00:40:06.332 --> 00:40:07.790
And to me, the
value of the science

00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:09.140
is that it increases awareness.

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:12.080
So we understand just how
powerful those things are,

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:14.651
and that the time that we spend
with our friends and family

00:40:14.651 --> 00:40:17.150
is not the stuff we do after
we've done the important stuff,

00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:18.650
that it is the important stuff.

00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:20.566
JACK: And that's also a
message for employers.

00:40:20.566 --> 00:40:23.810
I mean, obviously, here we
put a lot of emphasis on that.

00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:26.330
People are encouraged
to take their vacations,

00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:29.570
go home, be with their
families, things like that.

00:40:29.570 --> 00:40:33.320
So it's a real message around
if you want your employees to be

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:36.580
healthy, that it's just not a
nice-to-have, it's a must-have.

00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:37.955
DEAN ORNISH: And
it's unfortunate

00:40:37.955 --> 00:40:40.020
that the startup tech
world is often the mythical

00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:43.184
let's stay up all night and eat
pizzas and really run ourselves

00:40:43.184 --> 00:40:43.850
into the ground.

00:40:43.850 --> 00:40:46.067
And yet, you can do
that for a short time.

00:40:46.067 --> 00:40:48.650
But if you really want to keep
your creativity at its maximum,

00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:50.450
as you know, taking
care of yourself

00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:52.980
makes you smarter and makes
you work more effectively.

00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:53.480
JACK: Great.

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:54.500
Other questions.

00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:57.240
Please, right here in the front,
and then-- oh, good, good.

00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:58.360
There, and then the front.

00:40:58.360 --> 00:40:59.068
We have two mics?

00:40:59.068 --> 00:40:59.646
OK.

00:40:59.646 --> 00:41:00.520
There-- yeah.

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:02.150
AUDIENCE: So my
name is [INAUDIBLE],,

00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:04.880
and my question is
regarding caffeine.

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:07.710
There's a lot of confusion
regarding whether it's good or,

00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:09.002
if so, how much.

00:41:09.002 --> 00:41:10.460
I would love to
hear your thoughts.

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:12.001
DEAN ORNISH: Why do
you want to know?

00:41:12.001 --> 00:41:13.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:15.165
That's what I'm like when
I have too much caffeine.

00:41:15.165 --> 00:41:16.652
I'm very caffeine-sensitive.

00:41:16.652 --> 00:41:19.730
If I even have decaf,
it's like, hurry up!

00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:20.750
Can't you go any faster?

00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:22.958
[CHUCKLES] It's really-- it
makes me very aggressive.

00:41:22.958 --> 00:41:25.670
And I've learned to avoid
caffeine in all of its forms.

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:28.130
But my wife can drink three
cups of coffee and go to bed.

00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:31.760
So there is a lot of individual
variation around that.

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:34.220
The problem with caffeine is
that for some people like me,

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:35.490
it makes your fuse shorter.

00:41:35.490 --> 00:41:36.740
It can potentially add stress.

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:39.200
It makes you more likely
to be stressed out.

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:40.980
For other people,
it doesn't do that.

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:42.438
And there are other
things that are

00:41:42.438 --> 00:41:44.270
in coffee besides caffeine--

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:45.837
the polyphenols, and so on--

00:41:45.837 --> 00:41:48.170
that actually may be protective
against some of the more

00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:49.230
common chronic diseases.

00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:50.540
So you decide.

00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:53.780
If you find that you don't
have those negative side

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:55.730
effects from doing
caffeine, then that

00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:58.850
is probably good for
you, up to a point.

00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:00.400
JACK: This one
right in front here,

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:02.605
and then we'll go to the back.

00:42:02.605 --> 00:42:04.480
DEAN ORNISH: I'm like
Robin Williams on speed

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:05.271
if I have caffeine.

00:42:05.271 --> 00:42:05.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:09.100
AUDIENCE: So thanks for the
really interesting talk.

00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:10.070
I'm [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:11.735
JACK: Sorry, is the mic on?

00:42:11.735 --> 00:42:13.307
Just make sure it's on.

00:42:13.307 --> 00:42:14.140
AUDIENCE: Oh, sorry.

00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:14.797
JACK: Good.

00:42:14.797 --> 00:42:15.880
AUDIENCE: I'm [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:17.745
And so my question is on--

00:42:17.745 --> 00:42:19.495
so a lot of the
improvements you describe,

00:42:19.495 --> 00:42:22.540
they're these very human
lifestyle improvements.

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:25.480
So I was curious about whether
there's any sort of technology

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:28.420
that's emerging that you're
excited about that might also

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:31.259
effect these improvements
in people's lives.

00:42:31.259 --> 00:42:33.300
DEAN ORNISH: Yes, technology
is a powerful force.

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:34.750
I don't have to say
that here at Google.

00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:36.708
But it can be used to
bring us closer together.

00:42:36.708 --> 00:42:39.130
It can isolate us more, as
we talked about earlier.

00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:41.088
If you look at other
people's Facebook profile,

00:42:41.088 --> 00:42:42.300
it makes you separate.

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:44.440
But on the other hand, we
found that support groups

00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:45.160
are so powerful.

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:47.140
And after they finished
their Medicare--

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:50.230
and most insurance companies
are paying for 72 hours

00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:52.180
of the people meet twice
a week for 9 weeks,

00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:54.130
or a 12-day immersion retreat--

00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:57.310
and afterwards, we found that
because they've developed

00:42:57.310 --> 00:42:58.594
a sense of trust already--

00:42:58.594 --> 00:43:00.760
and trust is really everything,
because you can only

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:03.161
be intimate to the degree
you can open your heart

00:43:03.161 --> 00:43:03.910
and be vulnerable.

00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:06.285
And you can only do that to
the degree you feel trusting.

00:43:06.285 --> 00:43:09.437
And so that's why trust is
really fundamental to healing.

00:43:09.437 --> 00:43:11.770
And so once you develop that
sense of trust with a group

00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:14.350
of people, we then meet--
instead of having them come

00:43:14.350 --> 00:43:16.700
in a central place
which we found was hard,

00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:18.190
and particularly if they came
for a tour or retreat from

00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:20.424
different parts of the
country, they can all use--

00:43:20.424 --> 00:43:21.590
we use Zoom as a technology.

00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:26.116
But we could use Google or
anything to say, OK, between--

00:43:26.116 --> 00:43:28.240
they pick a day, like
Thursdays, from 5:00 to 6:00,

00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:29.823
we're going to have
our support group.

00:43:29.823 --> 00:43:30.460
It's 15 people.

00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:31.380
And they all chime in.

00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:33.730
I like Zoom, because whoever
is talking immediately

00:43:33.730 --> 00:43:34.570
fills the screen.

00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:36.550
Except for people who
are not very tech-savvy,

00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:38.100
it's an easy way to do that.

00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:40.630
And so that's just one example
of how technology can really

00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:44.224
be healing in a powerful way.

00:43:44.224 --> 00:43:46.140
AUDIENCE: One really
quick follow-up question,

00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:47.369
what about machine learning?

00:43:47.369 --> 00:43:49.910
So this is something I work on,
so I was just curious as to--

00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:51.435
JACK: Artificial intelligence,
machine learning.

00:43:51.435 --> 00:43:53.285
DEAN ORNISH: Yeah, well,
you're talking to the man here.

00:43:53.285 --> 00:43:55.010
He's having a conference
here for the next three

00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:55.690
days on that.

00:43:58.276 --> 00:44:01.294
What particular aspect of
that are you asking about?

00:44:01.294 --> 00:44:03.710
AUDIENCE: So one thing people
are excited about in machine

00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:05.720
learning at least, in
health applications,

00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:09.550
is trying to take image
data and try and spot

00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:12.240
sort of the progression
of diseases, for example.

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:12.782
So-- yeah.

00:44:12.782 --> 00:44:14.240
DEAN ORNISH: Well,
certainly, we're

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:15.656
already seeing
things in pathology

00:44:15.656 --> 00:44:20.000
that artificial intelligence
can actually diagnose cancers

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.430
more accurately and
sooner than even the most

00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:23.990
experienced radiologists.

00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:26.060
But I defer that
question to you, Jack.

00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:27.710
JACK: Sure.

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:29.810
Yeah, I would say, it's
a very exciting field.

00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:31.390
I think we're just
at the beginning.

00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:34.210
If you look at medical
imaging as an example,

00:44:34.210 --> 00:44:37.010
and there are several
projects across this campus

00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:40.190
and other startups and lots
of people beginning down

00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:43.550
this road, the good news
is I started my career

00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:46.680
in medical imaging at NIH.

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:49.810
And it's one of the fields
that has been most digitized.

00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:54.050
So the good news is, coming
out of most major scanners--

00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:56.810
Phillips, GE, so on
and so forth, Siemens--

00:44:56.810 --> 00:44:59.264
you get a digital file.

00:44:59.264 --> 00:45:00.680
Unfortunately,
most of those files

00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:03.260
get stored away in
some data center.

00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:04.940
And no one ever
looks at them again.

00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:08.090
We're beginning now as
a technology community

00:45:08.090 --> 00:45:11.024
to begin to tap into that
and then hook that up

00:45:11.024 --> 00:45:13.190
with the electronic medical
records, which again can

00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:15.710
be our ground truth as
to what did, in fact,

00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:16.670
happen to this person?

00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:19.610
What were they diagnosed as
based on the medical imaging?

00:45:19.610 --> 00:45:22.380
And then what was the ground
truth over the next five,

00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:25.130
six years of what
actually developed?

00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:28.430
And that becomes a rich
source of supervised learning

00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:32.570
possibility for neural
networks or other models

00:45:32.570 --> 00:45:33.570
that we can use.

00:45:33.570 --> 00:45:36.500
So I do expect this
kind of technology

00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:39.214
to really enhance the
role, say, for example,

00:45:39.214 --> 00:45:41.130
of the radiologists,
where the radiologist now

00:45:41.130 --> 00:45:44.000
is not just popping
something up on a screen.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.040
I literally still
visit hospitals today

00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:47.870
where people are
printing out films.

00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:50.099
And so it's still
happening today,

00:45:50.099 --> 00:45:52.640
where rather than looking at it
in a high-resolution monitor,

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:54.000
they're still printing out film.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.920
So that is changing.

00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:57.629
There are other parts--

00:45:57.629 --> 00:46:00.170
there are still a lot of records
that are not electronic yet.

00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:01.970
There is a lot of movement
to make that happen.

00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:03.386
And even when they
are electronic,

00:46:03.386 --> 00:46:05.060
we have to be
very, very careful.

00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:07.630
It's clear now that
we have to be--

00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:10.400
as we're ingesting
this data for the role

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:13.430
of supervised
learning, there's often

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:14.894
errors in terms of the labeling.

00:46:14.894 --> 00:46:17.060
And we have to be careful
about what we're training,

00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:18.090
what we're not training.

00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:21.050
We also to make sure that
we have a diversity in terms

00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:24.920
of the demographics that we're
ingesting into these AIs.

00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:27.110
And so if we're
going to do this,

00:46:27.110 --> 00:46:30.800
we want to make sure that we
have population pools that

00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:33.300
are drawn from a
wide gamut of society

00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:36.050
so that we haven't inadvertently
trained the AI to do

00:46:36.050 --> 00:46:38.000
a great job on this
part of the demographic

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.860
when their medical
image is taken in,

00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:42.080
but not that part
of the demographic.

00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:45.576
And I also think it's important
to do this on a global scale.

00:46:45.576 --> 00:46:47.450
There are some initiatives
in other countries

00:46:47.450 --> 00:46:50.080
to begin to add
to this database.

00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:51.650
But it's really just beginning.

00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:54.770
So my biggest concern right
now is about diversity,

00:46:54.770 --> 00:46:58.220
is about making sure that
as we're going through this,

00:46:58.220 --> 00:47:01.655
we have a real wide
diversity of patients that

00:47:01.655 --> 00:47:02.780
are coming into this thing.

00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:03.571
But yeah, go ahead.

00:47:03.571 --> 00:47:05.540
DEAN ORNISH: Let me
say one more thing.

00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:07.905
There's a company called
Lark that Julia Hu organized

00:47:07.905 --> 00:47:10.250
with a group of MIT
people that actually

00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:12.225
does AI text-based messaging.

00:47:12.225 --> 00:47:14.600
So it feels like there's a
health coach on the other end,

00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:15.740
but there's not.

00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:18.110
And actually, you can scale
that for virtually nothing,

00:47:18.110 --> 00:47:20.443
because you don't have to
have a coach on the other end.

00:47:20.443 --> 00:47:22.220
And so it's actually
getting increasingly

00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:25.700
effective at motivating people
to make behavioral changes that

00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:28.035
can be scaled at
virtually no cost.

00:47:28.035 --> 00:47:28.930
JACK: Yeah.

00:47:28.930 --> 00:47:33.350
The one real-world example
I would also point people to

00:47:33.350 --> 00:47:36.850
in the UK is something
called Babylon Health.

00:47:36.850 --> 00:47:39.510
People in the audience
and viewing this

00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:40.850
can check out that company.

00:47:40.850 --> 00:47:43.310
That company has not
just created a fun app

00:47:43.310 --> 00:47:46.730
which you can use to engage
on your health issues

00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:47.750
and also triage--

00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:50.300
the National Health Service
of England, of the UK,

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:52.970
uses it to actually
officially triage

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:56.007
1.5 million citizens in the UK.

00:47:56.007 --> 00:47:57.590
And so it's actually
an official part.

00:47:57.590 --> 00:47:58.240
DEAN ORNISH: Yeah,
it's beautiful.

00:47:58.240 --> 00:47:59.740
JACK: It's one of
the first examples

00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:02.270
that I've seen of a health
service incorporating

00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:04.280
this technology in
an official capacity.

00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:05.780
DEAN ORNISH: And
by the way, TRICARE

00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:07.560
is using the AI in
their app as well.

00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:09.560
So I think we're seeing
this more and more.

00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:11.540
And I think it's really
the wave of the future.

00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:12.040
JACK: Yeah.

00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:13.790
I think we had a
question back here.

00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:15.140
Yeah, please, your
name and-- go ahead.

00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:15.681
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:48:15.681 --> 00:48:16.880
My name is [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:19.940
I'm interested to know that
most people coming from India

00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:22.259
suffer from vitamin
D deficiency.

00:48:22.259 --> 00:48:24.050
And so we've been
prescribed by the doctors

00:48:24.050 --> 00:48:25.460
to take it as a supplement.

00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:27.320
What are the precautions
actually needed

00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:28.284
to mix it [INAUDIBLE]?

00:48:28.284 --> 00:48:30.200
And there are some
articles that I read online

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:32.199
that you shouldn't take
it with this supplement.

00:48:32.199 --> 00:48:34.491
You shouldn't take calcium
supplements along with iron.

00:48:34.491 --> 00:48:35.907
There are so many
confusing things

00:48:35.907 --> 00:48:36.950
about taking supplements.

00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:37.850
Can you clarify it?

00:48:37.850 --> 00:48:39.975
DEAN ORNISH: Well, it's
not just people from India.

00:48:39.975 --> 00:48:42.470
Most people in this country
are vitamin D3 deficient.

00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:45.090
And so I think that I would add
that to my list of supplements

00:48:45.090 --> 00:48:50.452
for most people is take 1,000
units of vitamin D every day.

00:48:50.452 --> 00:48:51.660
And I wouldn't worry so much.

00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:54.122
Vitamin D is a pretty innocuous
thing about combining that

00:48:54.122 --> 00:48:55.080
with other supplements.

00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:56.663
I'm not aware that
that's really going

00:48:56.663 --> 00:48:59.310
to create any major
problems for most people.

00:48:59.310 --> 00:48:59.814
JACK: Cool.

00:48:59.814 --> 00:49:01.439
Question here in the
front, we have a--

00:49:01.439 --> 00:49:01.939
great.

00:49:05.930 --> 00:49:07.880
AUDIENCE: Hi, this is
Alexis [INAUDIBLE]..

00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:09.060
Thank you so much, Dean.

00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:10.460
I have a question around sleep.

00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:11.680
We haven't touched on that.

00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:14.180
And I think all of us
would agree that it's

00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:15.190
increasingly important.

00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:17.065
And it's, in fact, one
of the most important.

00:49:17.065 --> 00:49:18.330
So what are your thoughts?

00:49:18.330 --> 00:49:20.270
DEAN ORNISH: Well,
sleep is one of the ways

00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:22.139
that your brain
detoxifies itself.

00:49:22.139 --> 00:49:23.930
And so there are a lot
of people who think,

00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:25.388
I don't need much
sleep, and so on.

00:49:25.388 --> 00:49:28.070
But Bill Clinton famously
said that the worst decisions

00:49:28.070 --> 00:49:30.079
he ever made were when
he was sleep-deprived.

00:49:30.079 --> 00:49:32.120
And I think Arianna
Huffington has done a of work

00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:34.369
in raising the awareness
about the importance of that.

00:49:34.369 --> 00:49:38.450
So I think if you want to really
be creative and innovative,

00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:40.410
as opposed to imitative,
try to get more sleep.

00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:41.990
It can really make
a big difference.

00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:43.130
JACK: Yeah, I think what's
interesting about sleep

00:49:43.130 --> 00:49:45.920
also is that we don't
fully know the science yet

00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:47.046
of how sleep is helping us.

00:49:47.046 --> 00:49:48.545
And so I think a
lot of times, we're

00:49:48.545 --> 00:49:50.480
willing to cut corners
on sleep, because we

00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:54.350
don't have that immediate
knowledge about what

00:49:54.350 --> 00:49:58.766
is actually happening in
the brain during the sleep.

00:49:58.766 --> 00:50:00.140
But obviously,
it's now come out.

00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:01.200
And it's very clear
from many studies.

00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:02.450
DEAN ORNISH: Well, I think,
even from an evolutionary

00:50:02.450 --> 00:50:04.880
standpoint, why would we
evolve to do something that's

00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:06.830
going to make us use
up so much of our life,

00:50:06.830 --> 00:50:09.540
make us completely vulnerable to
predators while we're sleeping,

00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:10.840
unless it was really important.

00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:12.430
And I think that's
part of why when

00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:14.180
I'm in the middle of
the night and wanting

00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:16.805
to get up and do work, I have to
remind myself of these things.

00:50:16.805 --> 00:50:18.080
[CHUCKLES]

00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:19.820
JACK: Exactly, great.

00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:21.320
We have one more
question back here.

00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:29.060
AUDIENCE: Hi, my
name is [INAUDIBLE]..

00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:31.880
My question is about the
prescription, the four pillars

00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:33.440
which you mentioned.

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:38.300
Does that change based on the
ethnicity or the underlying

00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:40.130
problem which a person
is trying to treat,

00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:42.850
like obesity or heart disease
or cancer or those things?

00:50:42.850 --> 00:50:43.250
Or is it all [INAUDIBLE]?

00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:44.330
DEAN ORNISH: Not really so much.

00:50:44.330 --> 00:50:45.810
I mean, we fine-tune
a little bit.

00:50:45.810 --> 00:50:48.560
Some people can metabolize
refined carbohydrates or gluten

00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:50.185
or things like that
better than others.

00:50:50.185 --> 00:50:52.740
But for the vast majority
of it, it's really the same.

00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:55.340
And when I started doing
this work, I predicted--

00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:56.930
incorrectly, as it turns out--

00:50:56.930 --> 00:50:59.060
that the younger people
who had less severe disease

00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:00.150
would do better.

00:51:00.150 --> 00:51:02.000
And what we found,
it wasn't a function

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.255
of age or disease severity.

00:51:03.255 --> 00:51:05.630
It was simply a function of
the more you change your diet

00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:07.100
and lifestyle in these
areas, the more you

00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:08.720
improve in every
metric we looked at

00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:10.511
and every disease we studied.

00:51:10.511 --> 00:51:12.260
Now, there may be ways
of fine-tuning this

00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:13.010
as we learn more.

00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:15.200
But what I'm still
so struck by is

00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:17.390
that these same
lifestyle changes,

00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:21.220
the more diseases we study and
the more biological mechanisms

00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:23.090
we research, the
more reasons we have

00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:24.590
to explain why they
are so powerful.

00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:26.060
And it's so hard for a
lot of people to believe,

00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:27.970
like, you mean talking
about my feelings

00:51:27.970 --> 00:51:29.010
is going to help me live longer?

00:51:29.010 --> 00:51:29.630
Are you kidding me?

00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:30.950
[CHUCKLES] Is that
the best you can do?

00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:32.870
It's like, yeah, as a
matter of fact, it is.

00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:34.970
I mean, David Spiegel
did a landmark study

00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:37.100
at Stanford years ago,
where he took women

00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:39.764
with metastatic breast
cancer, randomized them

00:51:39.764 --> 00:51:40.430
into two groups.

00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:42.054
Both groups were
getting the same chemo

00:51:42.054 --> 00:51:43.176
and radiation and surgery.

00:51:43.176 --> 00:51:45.050
But one group had a
support group once a week

00:51:45.050 --> 00:51:46.480
for an hour and a
half for a year,

00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:47.780
in the same way as we
were talking about.

00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:48.860
And then they stopped.

00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:51.020
Five years later, he told me
he almost fell off his chair

00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:52.145
when he looked at the data.

00:51:52.145 --> 00:51:53.720
Those women lived twice as long.

00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:55.490
So these simple
things can really

00:51:55.490 --> 00:51:57.240
make a powerful difference.

00:51:57.240 --> 00:51:57.770
JACK: Great.

00:51:57.770 --> 00:51:59.630
With that, thank you
very much for coming.

00:51:59.630 --> 00:52:01.310
