00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.140
For almost as long as there have been video
games, there have been film tie-ins.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.350
As a rumoured landfill filled with Atari ET
games can attest, the games don’t always

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.170
live up to the source material, but on the
flip side of that, some games actually manage

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:21.960
to eclipse the films they’re based on.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.580
While that may not be the case with every
game on this list, we think all of these games

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.169
did a pretty admirable job of capturing the
essence of the films that inspired them.&nbsp;

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:32.730
Here are 10 Amazing Video Games That Were
Inspired By Movies&nbsp;

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.020
Spiderman 2
While the Spider-Man franchise has had its

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.840
struggles over the years, the closest the
films ever came to getting it exactly right

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.840
was 2004’s Spider Man 2.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.770
Fortunately the game followed suit, and New
York became a gamer’s ultimate playground

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.239
as Peter Parker dealt with struggles big and
small.

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.870
The web slinging achieved what so many games
before had attempted, and while the side missions

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.530
are fun, it’s also nice to just go for a
leisurely swing around manhattan’s skyscrapers.&nbsp;

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.039
Ghostbusters
If you’re a movie geek but you don’t really

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.370
follow gaming, it may shock you to find out
that gamers were basically treated Ghostbusters

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.270
3 back in 2009 when all four of the original
Ghosbusters voiced their characters for the

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.610
multi platform game.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.480
Set two years after Ghostbuster 2, the player
gets to be a fifth Ghostbuster in training,

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.080
basically fulfilling every 80s kid’s fantasy.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.890
Dan Aykroyd and the late Harold Ramis, who
wrote the original films, even contributed

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.890
heavily to the game’s story and dialogue
to add to the game’s slimy authenticity.&nbsp;

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.790
Fast and Furious
Before Dom and his family became international

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.740
spies, the Fast and the Furious franchise
was all about one thing: street racing.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.350
So of course the arcade game based on the
first film was a straight-up racing game,

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.410
and one worth getting to the theatre a little
early for.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.930
The Fast and Furious arcade game was an unofficial
successor to the Cruis’n USA series, a fact

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.170
the makers can make no bones about&nbsp; since
they changed the name to Cruis’n when they

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.840
ported the game over to Wii after their licensing
for the film had run out.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.180
Aladdin
What could have just been a generic side scrolling

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.170
adaptation of the latest animated Disney hit
actually ended up being one of the biggest

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.730
and best games of 1993.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.030
Aladdin’s game designers were able to incorporate
cell animation from the actual Disney animators

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.000
who worked on the film for a much more vibrant
look than gamers were used to in those days.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.280
Kids who thought they were too old or&nbsp; cool
for a Disney game probably missed out on this

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.280
diamond in the rough.&nbsp;

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.080
Goldeneye
It’s almost not fair to include Goldeneye

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.200
on this list, as its legacy and impact as
a game has surpassed that of the film it’s

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.200
based on.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.159
This game predicted the demand for multiplayer
shooter games before it was possible to play

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:23.159
them online.

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:27.239
Along with Mario Kart, Goldenye best represents
that small window in video games’ history

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.920
when it was truly a group activity.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.401
The single player gameplay was decent and
somewhat faithful to the film, but Goldeneye

00:02:32.401 --> 00:02:36.450
will aways be remembered for it’s fun multiplayer
features like “slappers only” and the

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.670
advantages of being Odd Job.&nbsp;

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.409
Dune II&nbsp;
Dune II makes the list not for it’s faithfulness

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:45.670
to the source material, of which there’s
little, but for pioneering Real Time Strategy

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:46.670
games.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.760
Only loosely connected to the plot of the
films and books, Dune II had players building

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.021
and commanding armies to control the desert
world of Arakis.

00:02:52.021 --> 00:02:56.390
The team behind this game would later apply
this kind of gameplay to the hugely successful

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.849
Command and Conquer series.&nbsp;

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:02.269
Michael Jackson’s Moonwalker
The 80s were a strange time and few personified

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.310
it better than the king of pop, Michael Jackson.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.579
The man was a brand with almost as many merchandising
tie-ins as Star Wars.

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:11.799
It’s kind of faded into obscurity now, but
some of us still remember his film Moonwalker,

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:15.629
a collection of Jackson-centric vignettes
that were basically extended music videos

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:17.019
released as a feature film.

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.450
Of course there was a video game with Jackson
dancing his way through various levels while

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.450
saving children.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.980
It sounds silly, but this side-scroller was
oddly addictive.&nbsp;

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.069
Tron
Was there ever a more appropriate movie to

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.739
base a video game on than Disney’s 1982
gamer fantasy Tron?

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.909
Following a computer programmer who gets sucked
into his own program, the 3D look of the film

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:38.430
and early use of CGI predicted the future
of video games and movies.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.459
Aimed squarely at the burgeoning gamer demographic,
it’s no surprise that the arcade tie-in

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:43.829
was hugely successful.

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:48.109
Kids voted with their quarters and Electronic
Games magazine declared Tron the Coin-Operated

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:49.109
Game of the Year.

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:52.599
Tron remains one of the few recorded examples
of the game making more money than the movie

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:53.969
it was based on.&nbsp;

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:56.989
Jurassic Park
While the Sega Genesis Jurassic Park game

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.180
may not have a legacy quite as impressive
as the film, it was certainly a worthy tie-in

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.870
and one of the better home console games in
the early 90s.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.370
One unique feature was the option to play
as either Dr. Alan Grant or a velociraptor.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.860
While the levels were the same, the gameplay
was quite different depending on if you chose

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.969
to be the hero or one of his ferocious antagonists.

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:18.280
In a time when saving your game wasn’t an
option, the game utilized passwords for every

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.139
level so that players didn’t always have
to start at the beginning.

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.710
That might not sound like a big deal, but
today’s gamers definitely take always being

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.370
able to pick up where they left off for granted.&nbsp;

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.750
Star Wars
While Mel Brooks may have made fun of him

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.650
for it in Spaceballs, you gotta hand it to
George Lucas for inventing multiple revenue

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.139
streams by merchandising the heck out of Star
Wars.

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:40.090
Not only did he cram in ample characters to
maximize toy sales, he also got in on the

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.450
ground floor of gaming by crafting sequences
which leant themselves perfectly to the new

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:45.450
technology’s limits.

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.759
Released in 1983, the first Star Wars game
contributed to the Golden Age of Arcade games

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:52.599
and is still considered one of the most popular
games of all time.&nbsp;

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:55.980
Those are just some of our favorite videos
games that were inspired by hits from the

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:56.980
big screen.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:57.980
What are some of your favorites?

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:58.980
