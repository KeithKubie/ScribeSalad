00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:02.460
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Hi.

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.650
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: Hi guys.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:04.650
Thanks for comin' out.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.759
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: It was great to see all these
empty seats over here 'cause that means normally

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:08.760
this place is all packed.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.760
[laughter]

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:10.760
But not for us.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:11.760
[laughter]

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.590
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: Hey everyone thanks for comin'
out.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.780
My name is Jonathan, I work on the Google
Voice team.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:22.010
In addition to that I work with a lot of the
early adopters and influencers on Google+.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.210
And today we are joined by Mark Hoppus and
Tom DeLonge of blink-182.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.030
[applause and cheering]

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.050
So the guys have been kind enough to take
some time off the Honda Civic Tour to sit

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.620
with us and answer some questions.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.940
Today's discussion will be mostly around Google+
and the band's involvement as well as some

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.690
questions from our fans via the YouTube Moderator
Page.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:47.690
So let's dive in.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.079
&gt;&gt;Mark: Let's do it
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: How are you guys doin'?

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.990
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Doing well, doing well.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.899
Yeah I think that we stopped the rain --

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:54.899
[laughter]

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.600
today, pretty sure we stopped the rain.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.860
We're at the end of a 10 week tour so every
time I see people that I know they come up

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.270
to me and they say, "You look really tired
--

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.270
[laughter]

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.140
you look really tired."

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.149
Tom just looks that way always --

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:09.149
[laughter]

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:10.149
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: [laughs]

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:11.149
[laughter]

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:12.149
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: We're good though.

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:13.149
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: Good.

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:16.560
Tom this one's for you, I'm sure you're asked
this all the time but obviously we might have

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.539
some newbies in the room, if you could take
us a little bit through the formation of blink-182

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:26.259
and a brief history up until now of the release
of your new album Neighborhoods.

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:28.920
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Twenty years, it's a 20 year
--

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.920
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: [chuckles]

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.920
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: speech?

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:31.920
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: Give us the Cliff Notes.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.630
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: I got kicked outta high school
and I met his sister at the new high school

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.170
and his sister she goes, "Oh you play guitar
my brother's moving down here plays bass."

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.529
And I said, "Yeah you know."

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:47.289
At the time actually that's when I saw Scott
play 'cause Scott was playing drums, he wasn't

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.459
even in high school yet but he came over at
lunch time for a battle of the bands with

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:54.189
some other freshmen or something, he was like
in eighth grade.

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.549
And so he's at the school and we're like,
"Wow this guy's a great drummer," and he's

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.319
like in junior high.

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.299
So I started playing with him in his bedroom.

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:07.840
Then I met Mark through his sister at that
same school and we started a band and came

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.140
up with the name skateboarding one night and
here we are.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.680
But so now years later Travis was opening
up in another band and we were at odds with

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.860
the first drummer and we made a big departure
and got the new guy in and then the next thing

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.360
you know we're here.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.470
It's crazy.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.270
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Somewhere in there they invented
the Internet too.

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.270
[laughter]

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.330
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: And that's why we're here.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.330
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: That's why we're here.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.370
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Remember the first time I asked
you about the Internet I'm in Mark's bedroom

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.940
and I'm like, "Well now what the fuck is the
Internet?"

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:36.940
And he just goes, "Well no" --

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:37.940
[laughter]

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.290
this is the raddist thing about it it's so
new really at this time he goes, "No it's

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.450
like you can like grab anything and like there's
like a thing that you type in and it pulls

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.750
up information about that thing."

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.250
He's like, "For example," and you grabbed
duct tape.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.250
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Oh yeah.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.270
&gt;&gt;Tom Delonge: And you're all, "Like duct
tape," and he goes to the back of duct tape

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.330
and it's all ducttape.com.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.150
I was like, "Why would people got look up
info on tape?"

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.490
You know that's what I, but I was trippin'
that was my first experience.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.490
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: The fir --

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:58.490
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: The last thing I did.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.050
And the other thing is then I went out and
bought a computer to look up UFOs because

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.050
I thought that would be cool.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.050
[laughter]

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.050
And I was like that makes sense to me but.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.050
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: Nice.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.840
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: I ended up on the World Health
Organization diarrhea home page.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.840
[laughter]

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.793
It was my first, that was my first website
that I visited.

00:03:09.793 --> 00:03:10.793
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: He was always --

00:03:10.793 --> 00:03:11.793
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: It was always the same thing
it was like ?

00:03:11.793 --> 00:03:12.793
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Porn.

00:03:12.793 --> 00:03:13.793
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: my sister was telling me about
it --

00:03:13.793 --> 00:03:14.793
[laughter]

00:03:14.793 --> 00:03:15.793
[laughs]

00:03:15.793 --> 00:03:16.793
[laughter]

00:03:16.793 --> 00:03:17.909
and she was like, "You can look up anything,"
and I'm like, "alright look up diarrhea,"

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:18.909
--

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:19.909
[laughter]

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:20.909
and --

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:21.909
[laughter]

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:22.909
World Health Organization diarrhea homepage.

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:23.909
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Not beautiful, naked women,
there was like diarrhea --

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:24.909
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Nope.

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:25.909
[laughter]

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:26.909
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: Well good to know.

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:27.909
[laughs]

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:28.909
[laughter]

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:29.909
So Mark --

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:30.909
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: What was the question?

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:31.909
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: [laughs]

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:32.909
[laughter]

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:33.909
Something about the band back there --

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:34.909
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: [laughs]

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:38.620
I'm curious what drew you to activate on Google+,
you're obviously one of our more active users

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.620
and --

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.620
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Um-hum.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:41.620
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: I'm curious what your favorite
features are?

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.890
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: I love that from its integration,
from its inception that you could segment

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.000
who you spoke to and gave which information
to which is I think for me personally, and

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.980
I think for everybody in the world, is you
wanna share stuff with certain people.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.010
I like that ability.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.569
I didn't like having a public persona and
a private persona and having two different

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.390
web pages and things like that and Google+
had that from the beginning which really drew

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.569
me to it.

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:10.569
It's new.

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:16.430
I feel like the level of discourse on Google+
is really high right now.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:22.229
Obviously it's new so the people that are
coming to it are interested.

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.849
Everything works really well together, I like
the Hangouts.

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:29.509
I can't wait until I'm able to Hangout with
more than 10 people 'cause it's really weird

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:31.100
right now when I do a Hangout.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.100
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: [laughs]

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.100
[laughter]

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.740
It is because like I'll go in a Hangout and
10 people or nine other people will pop up

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.139
and everyone's just sitting there staring.

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:39.139
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: [laughs]

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:40.139
[laughter]

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:41.139
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: It this really him?

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.840
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: And it's, I've done this dozens
of times and they're like and I go, "So where

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.029
you guys all from?"

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:47.029
[laughter]

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:50.889
And it's cool because everyone's like you
know, "I'm from Turkey, I'm from South America,

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:52.289
from Australia."

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:53.529
And then nobody says anything.

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:54.529
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: [laughs]

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:58.189
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: And so it's about like 10 minutes
of me just goin' like, "Any questions?"

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:59.189
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: [laughs]

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:00.189
[laughter]

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:01.189
But it's cool I like having that kind of access
to people.

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:05.979
I like being able to post some things to just
my friends.

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:09.379
I like judging my friends and putting them
in certain circles accordingly.

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:10.379
[laughter]

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:12.309
I'm like the ruler of a small kingdom.

00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:14.819
I'm a benevolent king, I'm fair, but I --

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:15.819
[laughter]

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:16.819
yeah.

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:17.819
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: [laughs]

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:18.819
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: I'm also strict.

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:19.819
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: [chuckles]

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:20.819
[laughter]

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:21.819
Good to know you know how to use it.

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:22.819
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Yeah.

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:23.819
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: You got it goin'.

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:25.319
Tom we're honestly thrilled to have you on
Google+ and --

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:26.319
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Really?

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:27.319
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: we're --

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:28.319
[laughter]

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:29.319
well I know I am.

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:30.319
[chuckles]

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:34.590
And I'm just curious what your first impressions
are but more specifically how you've involved

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.499
social media as a big way of engaging your
fans over the years?

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:41.090
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Well I [clears throat] I was
always enamored with Google.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.740
I think that like when you look at all the
big tech giants of what's goin' on I mean

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.800
everyone references Apple for their hardware
and then everyone references Google.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.759
It's like you guys own the Internet it's all
this information and I always was so excited

00:05:54.759 --> 00:06:00.300
to see competitively what you guys were gonna
do with your company and all the incredible

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.370
wizardry that you have you know [chuckles].

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.080
And so when this came out I was instantly
drawn to it because I thought that you guys

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:11.870
would use the technology to really integrate
so well into things, it's not all there yet

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.470
but I can imagine what'll happen when you
start bringin' in like Google Maps and more

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.999
and all the streaming capabilities and email
capabilities and all that kind of stuff.

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:22.909
It seemed like the one missing component to
such a large world that you guys already had

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:26.080
so I was instantly just like, "Okay, this
is gonna be a really interesting and different

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.490
kind of take on the social experience."

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.080
For me it's always been really important as
the Internet, I always described it is like

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.210
the central nervous system that connects all
these different countries and people of varying

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:42.740
ethnicities and locations across the globe,
but it's like instantaneous this generation

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.740
of people so massively different then when
we were kids.

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.309
So I think for a company that's so heavily
entrenched in the Internet that's responsible

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:55.469
for so much of where it's going and what it's
capable of the idea of having a social network

00:06:55.469 --> 00:06:58.939
to be able to be the glue that ties all your
other pieces together I thought that would

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:05.400
be a great thing for our business and for
our band and that's how I look, I'm not much,

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.999
I do really stupid things when I just go out
there to say something just to say it like

00:07:08.999 --> 00:07:13.380
I'm not good at that kind of stuff 'cause
usually it's really bad and I understand that,

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.379
I'm trying to get better at that but it has
not gotten --

00:07:15.379 --> 00:07:16.379
[laughter]

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:17.830
any better for years.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:22.050
But to be an independent artist and to be
able to have that kind of reach and connectivity

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:27.500
with your fans and to understand where the
marketplace is going and how I want to basically

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:33.369
create art that can go, that can be a little
bit more forward thinking you need to have

00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:34.650
those types of tools.

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:40.059
And like Mark said being able to aggregate
people but also send them certain pieces of

00:07:40.059 --> 00:07:44.200
information based on who they are, what their
likes are I mean that's like the whole, that's

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.319
like a vague way describing what everyone's
going after.

00:07:48.319 --> 00:07:51.830
And I think that you guys can do anything
you want.

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:54.259
It's a blank canvas and that's what's exciting
to me.

00:07:54.259 --> 00:07:55.259
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: Cool.

00:07:55.259 --> 00:07:56.930
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: That's the short answer.

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:57.930
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: [laughs]

00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:59.270
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: [laughs]

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:04.300
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: Mark a personal favorite Google+
post of mine is actually when you chose to

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.509
reveal the track listing for your new album
--

00:08:06.509 --> 00:08:07.509
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Um-hum.

00:08:07.509 --> 00:08:08.999
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: via screen shot of just your iTunes
library.

00:08:08.999 --> 00:08:10.030
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Oh right.

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:14.129
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: And I'm just curious was this
planned, was this spur of the moment, and

00:08:14.129 --> 00:08:19.599
can we expect this to be like per se the new
press release artists doing it themselves?

00:08:19.599 --> 00:08:24.689
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: I didn't mean for it to be
the release of the album track listing.

00:08:24.689 --> 00:08:26.379
I didn't even think about it.

00:08:26.379 --> 00:08:28.920
I probably pissed a bunch of people off when
I did that.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:35.440
I was so excited to have the actual album
in my iTunes library as an album rather than

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:39.060
just a bunch of files that I'd taken home
from the studio as an actual thing at that

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:43.020
point that I took a screen shot of it just
'cause I was excited as a fan of our band

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:44.840
and I wanted to put it up there.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.100
But I think that, I think that is kind of
the new press release, I think that people

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.310
do more of their own press now.

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:58.030
Traditional media is also completely important
as well but for me I love that I can go on

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:02.540
Google+ and let a bunch of people know something
or Tweet something to two million people and

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.120
it's there, it's immediate.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:11.150
It allows us to be very agile with, I mean
from afar we look we're smart marketing, but

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:12.890
really I was just excited and I like to do
stuff.

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:13.890
[pause]

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:14.890
That's, it's just that --

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:15.890
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: You're anxious.

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:17.080
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: I'm anxious and I'm excited
--

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.080
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: [chuckles]

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.790
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: and I like that instant feedback.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:23.520
I like having a thought and having it go out
to a bunch of people even if it is dumb.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.900
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: [chuckles] I'm sure that your
fans appreciate it right?

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:27.020
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Some people do.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:28.020
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: [chuckles]

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:31.320
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: I never understand though I
never get like especially on across all of

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:35.210
this stuff like you post something and people
reply back, "Oh that's dumb," or, "You're

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:36.210
an idiot?"

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:38.360
And you're like, "You had to click a button
to follow me.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.360
[laughter]

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.920
You had to read my thing and then you had
to click a bunch more buttons to tell me you

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.240
didn't like what I said, just unfollow."

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.240
[laughter]

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.240
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: Haters gonna hate man.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.240
[laughter]

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.240
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Uncircle I don't get it.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.240
[laughter]

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.240
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: [laughs]

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:54.500
So Tom there's been some chatter about musician
roundtables using Hangouts on Google+ and

00:09:54.500 --> 00:10:00.980
I'm curious Hangouts max out at 10 people,
but in your dream scenario if you could Hangout

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:07.830
with anyone using Google+ alive or dead who
would you guys like to have, each of you?

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:08.830
&gt;&gt;Tom Delonge: Um --

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:09.830
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: [chuckles]

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:10.830
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Well you know I --

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:11.830
[laughter]

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:15.700
there's a lot, I think a lot I to me any kind
of interesting discussion it doesn't really

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:23.080
necessarily matter who it is I mean it would
be interesting to be with musicians, legendary

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:28.550
ones from the 60s, because to me it's come
full circle where bands came out selling very

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:34.190
few records and had to work really hard to
make some noise to get some attention.

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:37.190
And then we ushered in the 80s and 90s where
instantly you're selling millions, I mean

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:39.430
you don't have to do anything and you're selling
millions of records.

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:44.020
And then now you're all the way back to where
bands have to work so hard to sell a few and

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:48.730
I think it causes these artists to have to
really think about their art and be a lot

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:51.100
more progressive just to get any kind of attention.

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:55.080
So it's actually a good and a bad thing, but
it would be interesting to have discussions

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:59.740
with artists from that time period 'cause
I think back in the 60s and 70s that's when

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:04.240
you started getting bands like the Beatles
or Led Zeppelin and they really start thinking

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:09.280
bigger and different and just doing things
that set them apart from the norm.

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:13.760
And I almost feel like we're kind of going
into that same zone again.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:18.060
So to me that would be a really interesting
discussion but the idea that people can come

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:21.530
and attend these kind, these things is really
interesting.

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:26.770
That's what's so cool about the whole video
streaming thing it's just like that in itself

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:32.620
is a whole institution that can go for miles
and miles on its own outside of, I mean especially

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:35.020
integrated into the social network it's just
like it's incredible.

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:36.600
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: Mark, what about you?

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.600
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Oh --

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.820
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Napoleon Bonaparte.

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:39.820
[chuckles]

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:40.820
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: [chuckles]

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:46.880
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Probably my grandfather who
I never got to meet, somebody like Einstein,

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.600
probably Tom you and Travis would be in there.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.600
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: With Einstein?

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:51.600
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: With Einstein.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.010
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Just to make me look stupid,
that would be great.

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:54.010
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: I don't know.

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:55.010
[laughter]

00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:56.730
There's too much, I could think of a lot better
list --

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:57.730
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: [chuckles]

00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:59.220
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Creative people, creative,
smart people throughout time.

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:00.220
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: Socrates.

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:01.250
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Socrates.

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:03.460
It'd be a lot like Bill and Ted's Excellent
Adventure.

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:04.460
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: [laughs]

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:05.460
[laughter]

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:06.460
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: [laughs]

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:07.460
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: That's how you should think of
Hangouts.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:08.460
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Yeah totally.

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:10.140
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure,
that's good.

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:16.120
Now curious Mark you're actually known for
responding directly to fans within the comment

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.390
section of your Google+ posts.

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:18.390
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Yeah.

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:19.390
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: Why do you think this is important?

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:23.830
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: I just like setting people
straight and answering people's questions.

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:28.860
I've always, as a fan of music growing up
I always dreamed about being able to ask questions

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.590
of bands that I loved and obviously there
was never really.

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:36.640
Actually one time I saw They Might Be Giants
when I was 16 years old and I sent them a

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:37.810
letter.

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:41.830
They played a song in this concert that they
didn't put on any of their records and I sent

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:43.720
them a letter saying, "Hey how come you never
recorded that song, The Sound is a Mass of

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.400
Incandescent Gas?"

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:49.280
And I sent it to them and they actually emailed
not emailed me they actually mailed me back

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.320
a handwritten letter and I was like, "Wow
that's really cool!"

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:56.040
And to have that kind of access much more
convenient for me like I can answer people's

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:59.210
questions all day long and it kills time for
me and it lets people know what's up with

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:03.110
the band and I think that people know that
we honestly appreciate their support of our

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:04.110
music.

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:06.830
And I like that kind of interaction it's important
to me.

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.900
We've always been like that, we've always
hung out after shows and talked to people,

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:09.900
not you so much.

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:10.900
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: [chuckles]

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:11.900
[laughter]

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:12.900
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Hang on, hang on, I hide a
little bit.

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:14.060
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: But I like that kind of interaction,
I like that.

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:18.060
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: You guys should create like
hardware that they can stick on their bodies

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:19.160
and we can really touch them.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.160
[laughter]

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.160
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: [laughs]

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.160
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Next question.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.160
[laughter]

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.160
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: That's why --

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.160
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: I'm being --

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.160
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: That's why he doesn't post.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.160
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: That's true, that is true.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.160
[laughter]

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.160
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: [chuckles]

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.160
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: We need those gems.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.160
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: [laughs]

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:35.280
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: So Tom in 2005 blink-182 toured,
2005 was actually pretty neat because it also

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:41.670
saw the launch of YouTube and I'm curious
how does it feel to have a shift from video

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:43.830
spins to YouTube views?

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:50.010
It is more promising in a way that fans can
access your videos on demand instead of watching

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:52.820
TV at the right time and hoping to catch maybe
--

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:53.820
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Oh yea.

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:54.820
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: a snip-.

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:56.030
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: It's a total game changer and
the coolest thing --

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:57.030
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Game changer!

00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:58.030
Oh buzz word.

00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:59.030
[laughter]

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:00.030
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Um --

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:01.890
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Time to think outside the box.

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:03.570
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: [laughs]

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:04.570
[laughter]

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:05.570
Synergy.

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:06.570
[laughter]

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:07.570
Anyways --

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:08.570
[laughter]

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:09.570
to get back to the --

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:10.570
[laughter]

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:12.060
what it cools it's like now it's like, "Hey
have you heard of this band or have you heard

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.340
of this song or have you heard of anything?"

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:19.020
YouTube is like the new, it's almost like
a mini different version of an encyclopedia,

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:20.670
you can instantly go there and get some information
on it.

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:23.310
You can either hear the song or you can see
the video or you can see an interview or you

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:28.610
can see a TV performance or you can see some
kid his review about a book or a movie or

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:29.610
whatever.

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:34.160
It's like, it's you can go to places like
Wikipedia or whatever but YouTube is like

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:39.620
this more from the common person like really
putting their thoughts up whether it's like

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:41.490
they, a lot of times it's a kid.

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:46.620
I've had kids stand outside the studio and
record stuff from their car go put it on YouTube

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:51.160
and just like this echo, like I don't know,
I think it's totally a changing --

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.300
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: You can say it, I won't say
--

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:56.120
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: I don't if I'm scared to say
it but it is 'cause it totally changes the

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:57.120
game for everyone.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.120
[laughter]

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.590
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: I just like it for the Honey
Badger [laughs].

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:02.590
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: [laughs]

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:03.590
[laughter]

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:04.590
Which you hadn't even --

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:05.590
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: I didn't even know about --

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:06.590
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: You hadn't even seen that.

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:07.590
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Honey Badger until two days
ago.

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:08.590
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: What's Honey Badger?

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:09.590
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Honey Badger I'll show you.

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:10.590
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Have you guys seen, alright.

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:11.590
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: [chuckles]

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:12.590
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Never mind.

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:13.590
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: You'll see it.

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:14.590
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: I mean just all the stuff --

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:15.590
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: You guys have some weird shit
on YouTube that's what I've noticed.

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:16.590
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Double rainbow, like all of
the classics.

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:17.590
[laughter]

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:18.590
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: [chuckles]

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:19.590
&gt;&gt; Tom: Peanut Butter Man.

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:20.590
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Dude.

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:21.590
&gt;&gt; Tom: Peanut Butter Man exactly.

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:22.590
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: I haven't even seen that one.

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:23.590
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: [unintelligible] Peanut Butter
Man.

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:24.590
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Peanut Butter you guys can
search that on your own network.

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:25.590
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: [laughs] You're own --

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:26.820
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: What are you guys putting up
there?

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:31.130
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: So this is for both of you, I'm
assuming you both use Smartphones and I'm

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:36.140
curious besides the Google+ app what are your
favorite apps.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:37.140
I'm curious --

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:38.140
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Oh show 'em yours

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:39.140
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: I'm just curious --

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:40.140
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: This one.

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:41.140
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: what would make your life --

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:42.140
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Your mustache app.

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.340
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: I know I love the mustache
app, it's funny but --

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:45.340
[laughter]

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:46.340
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: [laughs]

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:47.340
Do you not have it?

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:48.340
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Oh I do but it's just --

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:49.340
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Oh, okay.

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:50.340
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: But no I just don't if that's
appropriate.

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:51.340
Well everyone's got Apple computers, I have
an iPhone I don't if that's --

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:52.340
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Ladies and gentlemen he has
an iPhone, don't --

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:53.340
[laughter]

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:54.340
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: I know.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:57.240
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: There's a few of us that have
iPhones, too.

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:59.740
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: What are our favorite apps,
my favorite apps is that the question?

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:03.050
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: Well anything particular maybe
something that makes life on the road more

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:06.640
convenient or maybe stayin' in touch with
your family and --

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:07.640
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Right.

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:08.640
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: friends a little bit easier.

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:10.170
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Well per, I'm not much --

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:11.270
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Chat Roulette.

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:12.270
[laughs]

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:13.270
[laughter]

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:14.270
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: What did you say Chat Roulette?

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:15.270
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Chat Roulette.

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:16.270
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Yeah.

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:17.270
[laughter]

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:18.480
I've heard about that I haven't done that.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.510
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: I haven't either.

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:20.510
I'm too afraid.

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:21.510
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Yeah.

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:22.510
[laughter]

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:23.510
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: I'm just too afraid.

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:24.510
[laughter]

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:25.510
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: I keep thinkin' it's just gonna
be a naked man and --

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:26.510
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: That's all it is!

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:27.510
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Is that what it is?

00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:28.510
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: That's all it is!

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:29.510
[laughter]

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:30.510
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Like his dad's like waving
at him.

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:31.510
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: [laughs]

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:32.510
[laughter]

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:33.510
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: But I --

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:34.510
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Wait for my dad's IPO.

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:35.510
[laughter]

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:36.880
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Well I don't know the apps
I'm, I like to, the only apps I really use

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:42.290
for real are like news kind of stuff and art
or movies and so like I'm not --

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:43.290
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: The Onion.

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:45.980
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: I like the Onion a lot because
it cheers me up a bit.

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:51.401
And by the way I was just at the White House
and Barack Obama reads The Onion every day,

00:16:51.401 --> 00:16:53.380
it's on his secretary's desk right one the
top.

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:55.030
He wants to cheer up a bit too I guess but
--

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:56.080
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: [laughs]

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.080
[laughter]

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:01.380
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: But it's infinite though and
you know what's really cool about Android

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:07.380
is you guys are the new Microsoft and Microsoft's
ancient, it's a whole different, what I loved

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:08.380
about it is like --

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:09.570
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: You're gonna get it.

00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:10.570
You're gonna get it.

00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:11.570
[laughter]

00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:12.570
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: I understand, I know.

00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:13.570
[laughter]

00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:14.570
But I really believe that.

00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:18.050
I believe that that whole the idea as open
source and having the Internet connected into

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:21.310
it is really appealing and really competitive.

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:27.839
And all the hype that Microsoft got back in
the day is now here with that and it's, and

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:31.110
I don't know I think that what's more exciting
is not so much the apps that I love it's just

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:36.270
the fact that there are apps that people can
go out and you can be anybody in a bedroom

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:40.800
and figure it out and launch an application
or program and it's not 50-60 bucks like it

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.310
used to be, it can be 99 cents or whatever
so.

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:44.310
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: True.

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:45.310
Mark what about you?

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:46.500
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Oh apps?

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.500
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: Yeah.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:48.960
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: I'm just traditionalist.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:52.110
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Words with Friends kind of
guy?

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:53.500
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Words with Friend, I do a lot
of Words with Friends yeah.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:54.500
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: Instagram.

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:55.500
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: I destroy people.

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.680
Instagram I like a whole lot, I love Instagram.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:17:59.680
Hipstamatic's cool.

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:00.680
I mean there's all those --

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.220
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: The camera apps are awesome
yeah.

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:04.850
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Camera apps are great, all
the social networking ones.

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:06.520
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Mustache apps.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.020
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Mustache apps.

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:09.020
[laughter]

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:10.020
That's about it.

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:11.020
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: No fart apps, nothin'?

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:12.020
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: No fart apps, no --

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:13.020
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Those are good.

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:14.020
The time I've done 'em --

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:15.020
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Livesaver apps.

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:16.020
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: quite a few fart apps.

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:17.020
[laughter]

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:18.020
You can put 'em on timers.

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:19.020
[laughter]

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:20.020
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Oh.

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:21.020
That's solid.

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:22.020
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: So you hide it in the other
part of the room.

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:23.020
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: [laughs]

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:24.020
[laughter]

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:25.280
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: So we're gonna take some time
we're gonna take some questions.

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:32.680
We had a ton of questions submitted online
so we set up a YouTube Moderator Page and

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:35.600
I'm gonna go ahead and read some of those
off for you guys.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:41.040
So a Mighty Big Dan from British Columbia
asks: "Tom, how long does it take for you

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:44.309
to write your lyrics, where does most of your
inspiration come from?"

00:18:44.309 --> 00:18:48.420
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: It doesn't take me too long.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:54.640
My inspiration usually comes from, once the
music for the song is more or less close to

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:59.290
being completed I'll just try and find an
emotional current in it that makes sense.

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:02.910
I'll either identify with it and write exactly
like it or try and write the opposite.

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:07.260
It's a good question 'cause I think it's different
for every artist, they always say, "I write

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:10.950
the words first," but not for myself.

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:15.090
I like to write the music first 'cause that
to me is like the foundation of the building

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:17.600
you build on top of it.

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:18.970
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Um.

00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:19.970
[laughter]

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:22.580
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: So "Cale Basque" maybe I pronounced
that correctly -- [chuckles]

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:24.640
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: hoping you're right

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:25.640
[laughter]

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:29.630
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: from San Jose asks: "What's going
on with the blinkumentary?

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:32.890
Super excited for when it comes out, I'm sure
it will be great."

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:35.800
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: We are still working on it,
it's still being filmed.

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:38.900
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: I won't lie I don't even know
much of what this is.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:42.640
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: We've been, a friend of ours
by the name of Haven Lamoureux has been on

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:47.010
the road with us for two years kind of documenting
the reformation of the band, us going on our

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:52.530
first tour, us going in the studio working
on this record, and I think we're gonna wrap

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:55.810
it up, I mean we've been wrappin' it up for
it seems like six months now.

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:58.010
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: It's hard 'cause you keep,
we've been doin' a lot of important things

00:19:58.010 --> 00:19:59.010
the past couple months.

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:00.010
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Yeah.

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:01.010
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: It's kind of like keep filmin'.

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:02.010
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: [chuckles]

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:04.530
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Yeah it's an ongoing thing
that hopefully will get released fairly soon.

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:06.210
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: Cool.

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:11.809
So "X FOB M" from Belgium asks: "What's your
best memory ever when you were on tour?"

00:20:11.809 --> 00:20:14.020
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Well that's hard.

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:19.330
One of the best recent ones we were fortunately
able to headline Reading Festival --

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:20.330
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Um-hum.

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:22.490
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: in Leeds which is 100,000 people,
it's the biggest festivals in the world for

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:25.150
a rock band and, or probably in general.

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:30.420
So when you get an opportunity to headline
that festival it's like it's a highlight of

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:31.420
your career.

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:34.780
And we did that and broke quite a few records
that night at that festival.

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:37.050
It's in England and that was huge.

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:40.120
Comin' off that you felt pretty good about
yourself.

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:41.930
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: Lots of people.

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:44.059
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Yeah it's a lot of people,
yeah it's crazy.

00:20:44.059 --> 00:20:46.610
And they're all staring at your it's like
weird but.

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:47.610
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: [chuckles]

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:48.610
[laughter]

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:53.590
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: So Black Bird 192 from Italy asks:
"Wishing Well, a song that may represent the

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:58.220
story of everyone of us fans and blink told
in three and a half minutes, where did you

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:01.670
find the inspiration to touch so many hearts
with such an amazing song?"

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:02.970
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Props.

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:03.970
[laughter]

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:04.970
Super props.

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:07.710
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: I actually wrote the lyrics,
you asked about the lyrics, I wrote the lyrics

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:10.090
to that at my daughter's school.

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:13.400
And there was a picnic going on and I was
not engaged 'cause we were late on the [unintelligible]

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:14.400
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: [laughs]

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.320
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: there was all these kids running
around bouncing off the walls and I'm sitting

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.560
at a little bench I'm just like what rhymes
with, I'm finding rhyme apps on my phone,

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:20.560
I'm like --

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:21.560
[laughter]

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:22.560
rhymes with.

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:23.560
I didn't necessarily do that, I had no service.

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:24.560
[laughter]

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:25.560
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: That's one of your favorite apps
right?

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:27.030
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: You gotta come up with a better
story than that.

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:31.110
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: But that's the truth but I
mean I fortunately I'm a really focused when

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:34.390
it comes to studio stuff so it doesn't really
matter where I'm at I mean I obsess over it

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:39.700
to where my wife hates me because that's I
just live in those songs for the totality

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:41.100
of the recording.

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:45.400
So whether I'm at Chat Roulette with naked
men or I'm at a school -

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:46.400
[laughter]

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.030
I'm dedicated to figuring it out.

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:53.160
But Wishing Well it's a great song it's a,
and the song really is just about being a

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.590
little bit lost, trying to find your way.

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:58.840
And I think there's a lot of that on our record
where it's everyone's trying to get by and

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:02.130
everyone's trying to win in their own way
but were all in it together so.

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:05.190
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: You did a good job.

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:06.190
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Thank you.

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:07.190
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: That song's really good.

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:09.880
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: Our final one, so Blind Brown
Eyes then we're gonna take some questions

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:10.880
?

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:11.880
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Oh got it.

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:12.880
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: from Googlers.

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:13.880
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Did you say we're gonna take
some questions from lawyers?

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:14.880
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: Googlers.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:15.880
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Oh, got it.

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:16.880
[laughter]

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:17.880
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: Google lawyers , there might be
some lawyers in there.

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:18.880
[laughter]

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:19.880
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: [laughs]

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:20.880
[laughter]

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:21.880
Talk to my attorneys.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:22.880
[laughter]

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.400
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: So Blind Brown Eyes from Belgium
asks: "What's it like to be a hero for so

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.400
many people?"

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.400
[pause]

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.400
[laughter]

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.400
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: [laughs]

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.400
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Oh.

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.400
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: No pressure.

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.400
[laughter]

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.400
Tom DeLonge: Who are they asking?

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.400
No us right, they're asking --

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:40.200
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: It's humbling, it's yeah, I'd
say it's humbling, it's really cool to get

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.800
to do what we do.

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:47.020
We're amazed that after 20 years that we still
get to come out and play Shoreline Amphitheater.

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:52.020
I grew up in California and one year I lived
actually in Mountain View and I remember when

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:56.940
they built Shoreline Amphitheater and to think
that I play that place now with my job is

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:57.960
pretty awesome.

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:03.060
It's really a blessing, it's really fun and
you're welcome for being your hero.

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:04.060
I don't know --

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:05.060
[laughter]

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:06.060
what do you want me to say?

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:07.060
[laughter]

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:08.060
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: Cool.

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:11.360
So I think we're gonna take some questions
from Googlers if we have some time.

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:12.360
&gt;&gt;voices in audience: murmuring

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.200
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Are we gonna do like a Maury
thing and find if somebody's a dad?

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.200
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: Yeah.

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.200
[laughter]

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.200
You have to do the dance though.

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.380
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Okay cool.

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:19.920
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Do the dance.

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:23.780
&gt;Jonathan: So if you guys, I guess if we wanna
start lining up if anyone has questions for

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:24.780
the guys.

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:26.900
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Should be pre-screen everybody
and make sure they're all complimentary?

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:27.900
&gt;Jonathan: [laughs]

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:28.900
[laughter]

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:29.900
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: [laughs]

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:30.900
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: It's the only thing we have here.

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:35.559
&gt;&gt;male #1: So you brought up the open source
of Android and so I have a question about

00:23:35.559 --> 00:23:36.890
music and open source.

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:41.830
Do you see music moving towards open source
and really finding your revenue from concerts

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:44.610
and merchandise and making music free for
everyone?

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:46.760
Do you think music should move in that direction?

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:50.050
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: I think that's a great question.

00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:55.080
That's a really hard question to answer but
I think that there's some kind of, I think

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:56.610
that there's a compromise.

00:23:56.610 --> 00:24:01.900
And I think that music, the digital rights
management, they should go away.

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:05.549
That makes it kinda difficult 'cause then
the companies are kinda owning their own versions

00:24:05.549 --> 00:24:07.330
of the songs.

00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:13.330
But what I do think is that there is a place
to follow that's very similar to how applications

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:16.620
are running where you put out an application
and then there's a free version and then if

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:19.960
you like it you can basically up-sell them
to something else.

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:23.520
And I think that music can work that way as
well where you put out some free stuff and

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:29.460
you can complete the record or you can have
access to physical goods as well, collectible

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:30.460
items.

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:36.030
And a merging of multiple institutions where
I think record labels and fan clubs and merchandising

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:39.440
companies and things that are traditionally
completely separate are all comin' together

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:42.350
so you can have the ability to do that.

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:47.300
'Cause right now I mean for example we put
out our record a week or so ago and there

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:52.200
was a massive issue 'cause one group owned
the songs, one group owned the technology,

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.580
one group owned all the physical goods, and
then the band was over here and everyone was

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:57.360
makin' money except for the band and made
it really hard.

00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:59.370
And then they all starting yelling at each
other and then the whole thing broke down

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:03.170
and we weren't even really personally involved
in those conversations.

00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:07.450
And music was one of those industries where
so many people came in over the decades and

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:13.280
all starting grabbing pieces and it just became
a really hard thing to create a business out

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:14.280
of it later.

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:18.360
So my answer is I think it's gonna be some
kind of compromise, but I do think there is

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:23.809
an element of it being free and I think that
that's one of those things where you steak

00:25:23.809 --> 00:25:27.520
your reputation on it kinda, "I believe that
you will like what we do so I'm willing to

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:31.490
let some of it go out to everybody," but to
what degree is gonna vary.

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:32.960
&gt;&gt;male #1: Thank you.

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:33.960
[pause]

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:34.960
&gt;&gt;male #2: Hey guys.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:39.360
Everyone's a collector, I think, of something
in their own way whether it's small or big

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.510
so I just wanna know if you guys collect anything?

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:43.180
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Bodies.

00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:44.180
[laughter]

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:53.660
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: I collect vintage guitars,
Simpsons action figures, and art.

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:56.730
Not like a big collector of whatever but I
like art.

00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:57.730
&gt;&gt;male #2: Okay.

00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:59.850
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: I'm really bad at that stuff,
yeah.

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:05.510
You know what's funny I don't like, I looking
in, it's really to my detriment too.

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:10.230
I look forward so much that I don't look in
the past so I never collect, nothing, I don't

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:12.780
really value too many things from the past.

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:16.730
Wife gets mad there's like photos and like
I kinda find it sad when you look like at

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:18.890
a photo and you're like, "Oh my God we were
happy, we were young --

00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:20.350
[laughter]

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:21.350
remember it.

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:22.350
[laughter]

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:26.530
But clutter is weird to me but I always envy
like, remember you were collecting llamas

00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:27.720
for a longest time too.

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:28.720
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Oh yeah I collect hotel room
keys --

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:29.720
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Hotel keys that's what it was
yeah.

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:33.410
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: I have boxes of hotel room
keys from touring over the years.

00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:34.620
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: It's not weird it's just --

00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:40.830
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: I love the actual keys, I have
like a shoestring with actual keys on it,

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:44.360
but now people like me stole all those keys
so they have to go to keycards and now I just

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:45.360
?

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:46.360
&gt;&gt;male #2: Nice.

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.360
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: have rows and rows of keycards.

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.360
&gt;&gt;male #2: Gotcha.

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:49.360
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: I could break into any hotel
in the world.

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:50.360
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Ah that's true--

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:51.360
[laughter]

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.360
&gt;&gt;male #2: You can use their pool for free
right?

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:53.360
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Yeah for sure.

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:54.360
&gt;&gt;male #2: That's the way to do it yeah.

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:55.360
So I collect T-shirts and Android figures
--

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:56.360
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Oh cool.

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:57.360
&gt;&gt;Male #2: and just wanted to see if you guys
wanted to trade anything for --

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.360
[laughter]

00:26:58.360 --> 00:26:59.360
one of these T-shirts?

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:00.360
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus and Tom DeLonge: [laugh]

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:01.360
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Mark will.

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:02.360
He'll give you some keys.

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:03.360
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: [laughs]

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:04.360
&gt;Mark Hoppus: Yeah, what have I got?

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:06.380
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Here's the key to my room now.

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:07.380
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: [laughs]

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:08.380
[laughter]

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:09.380
I got guitar picks.

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:10.380
I don't have 'em with me though.

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:11.380
&gt;&gt;Tom: I just got soft kisses [chuckles]

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:12.380
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: I'll owe ya right here.

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:13.380
[laughter]

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:14.380
I'll owe ya some guitar picks.

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:15.380
[laughter]

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:16.380
&gt;&gt;male #2: Here ya go, so I'll give you guys
--

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:17.380
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Cool thanks.

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:18.380
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Very nice.

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:19.380
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Much appreciated.

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:20.790
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Thank you sir.

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:21.790
I don't know --

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:23.430
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Can we open up?

00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:25.549
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: We could break it in half --

00:27:25.549 --> 00:27:27.470
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Should be open up?

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:28.470
[laughter]

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:30.360
Looks like it's supposed to open up, sorry.

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:31.360
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: [laughs]

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:32.360
[laughter]

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:33.570
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Thanks for this [makes noise]
.

00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:34.570
[laughter]

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:37.180
&gt;&gt;male #3: Hey guys how come you never toured
in South America?

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:38.180
[laughter]

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:39.180
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: We tried.

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:42.809
We had a bunch of stuff booked years ago and
that is the goal.

00:27:42.809 --> 00:27:45.910
It's just a matter of getting down there at
the right time because when you release a

00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:50.540
record there's certain things and certain
places you have to be at a certain time, right?

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:56.260
So they start mapping out the whole world
and, but I think it's long past due that we

00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:57.260
get down there.

00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:58.260
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Absolutely.

00:27:58.260 --> 00:27:59.260
&gt;&gt;male #3: You guys have a huge fan base in
South America.

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:00.260
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Yeah.

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:03.330
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: We've very lucky Brazil, South
America in general is gigantic for us and

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:04.330
we've never toured there.

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:07.460
I think when we very first started off it
was too prohibitively expensive for us to

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:14.020
go and then when we should have gone there
we were touring other places and now it's

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:16.080
just a matter of getting us down there.

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.160
&gt;&gt;male #3: Cool, thanks.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:18.160
[pause]

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.160
&gt;&gt;male #4: Hey guys.

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.160
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Hi.

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:23.550
&gt;&gt;male #4: Two quick questions: What would
you guys do if you were never in the music

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:25.640
industry and your favorite blink-182 songs?

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:30.320
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: I would still live with my
mom.

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:31.320
[laughter]

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:32.950
And I don't know, what would you do?

00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:34.110
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: I would still be --

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:35.309
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Live with my mom?

00:28:35.309 --> 00:28:38.340
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: would still be living with
my mom, I'm living with her now, you know

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:39.340
what I'm saying?

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:40.340
[laughter]

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:42.340
No I would be driving, I would still be doin',
this is what we did.

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:46.370
Mark would be, it would be three in the afternoon
he's got a burrito and a Big Gulp and video

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:50.919
games and I would show up in a truck with
concrete and I'd say, "Dude, come help me

00:28:50.919 --> 00:28:51.919
deliver this shit.

00:28:51.919 --> 00:28:53.400
It's so heavy I can't do it by myself."

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.400
He's be like, "Alright."

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:57.950
And he would just jump in, he would help me
deliver concrete, he'd be like, "I'm sore

00:28:57.950 --> 00:29:00.320
for like five days, I'm not gonna do this
every day."

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:06.390
So I don't know I think about that all the
time like I was like yeah, yeah, a couple

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:10.370
back surgeries later I'm, I was delivering
giant things of concrete, Mark was playin'

00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:13.360
video games at home and that's about all we're
good for outside of this.

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:14.360
[laughter]

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:15.360
&gt;&gt;male #4: And favorite blink songs?

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:18.140
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Oh man I don't know I really
--

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:19.140
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: It totally changes day to day.

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:20.140
&gt;&gt;male #4: Yeah.

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:21.140
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: They all serve a different
purpose.

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:22.140
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Yeah.

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:26.980
Right now I'd say After Midnight 'cause that's
our new single and I love Wishing Well that's

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:27.980
a great song.

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:31.440
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Yeah I mean I like, I really
like, we have a song called Violence which

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:35.390
is on our last record which is kinda this
mix of electronic and punk rock, it's was

00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:40.570
a lotta fun when that song happened because
it really showed, it showed kind of the convergence

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:47.110
of drum and bass music and pop punk music
and I think that also was a little bit of

00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:51.190
a window into where we were going with this
record so.

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:52.840
But favorites it doesn't really work.

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:53.950
&gt;&gt;male #4: Thank you.

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:54.950
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Thanks.

00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:55.950
[pause]

00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:56.950
&gt;&gt;female #1: Hi.

00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:57.950
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Hello.

00:29:57.950 --> 00:29:58.950
&gt;&gt;female #1: I really like your nail polish.

00:29:58.950 --> 00:29:59.950
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Oh thanks.

00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:00.950
&gt;&gt;female #1: [laughs]

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:04.130
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: The sad part about this nail
polish is that this happened completely sober.

00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:05.130
&gt;&gt;female #1: [laughs]

00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:06.130
[laughter]

00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:07.290
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: I did this of my own free will.

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:10.000
I bought it and I thought it would be cool
last night.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.970
&gt;&gt;female #1: I like to make poor choices when
I'm sober as well.

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:12.970
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Good okay.

00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:13.970
[laughter]

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:14.970
&gt;&gt;female #1: So --

00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:15.970
[laughter]

00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:16.970
I actually wanna --

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:17.970
[laughter]

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:19.040
I actually just wanna bring the mood down
a little bit, ask a serious question.

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.040
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Okay.

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:23.540
&gt;&gt;female #1: If, this is for both of you,
if you guys were a mythical creature --

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:24.610
[laughter]

00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:25.610
what would you be

00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:26.610
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: This guy.

00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:27.610
&gt;&gt;female #1: and why?

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:28.610
[laughter]

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:29.610
&gt;&gt;female #1: The man riding the unicorn or
the unicorn -- [laughs]

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:30.610
[laughter]

00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:31.610
with a rainbow out of it's butt?

00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:36.230
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: This is a Viking riding a unicorn
blasting out of its rear end a rainbow --

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:37.230
[laughter]

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:38.230
in front of the moon.

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:41.940
He's got red high tops on, he's holding aloft
an AK-47 getting struck by lightning.

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:43.400
There's, you can't get better than that.

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.400
[laughter]

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:45.400
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: No.

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.400
[laughter]

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:47.400
&gt;&gt;female #1: Okay, cool, fair enough.

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:48.400
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: The actual name of this shirt
is Awesome 5000.

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:49.400
&gt;&gt;female #1: [laughs]

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.400
[laughter]

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:51.400
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: It has its own title so you
yes, I would be him.

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:52.400
&gt;&gt;female #1: Nice.

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.400
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: That's good.

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:54.400
I don't really have a good answer like that.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.400
[laughter]

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.400
&gt;&gt;female #1: I shoulda let you go first.

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:57.400
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Oh yeah and you should have.

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.410
If I was to be a mythical, a mythical creature
of any sort --

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:01.610
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: What about the guy from the
Old Spice ads the half man, half horse --

00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:02.610
[laughter]

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:03.610
he's pretty rad.

00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:04.610
[laughter]

00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:05.610
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Was that Centaur?

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:06.610
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: I think so, I don't know.

00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:07.920
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Does he have a huge --

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:08.920
[laughter]

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:10.490
If that's the case, do you guys know this
--

00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:11.490
[laughter]

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:12.490
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Stop.

00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:13.490
[laughter]

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:14.490
Stop!

00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:15.490
[laughter]

00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:16.490
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: You guys --

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:17.490
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Save yourself.

00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:18.490
[laugh]

00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:19.490
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: asked me, do you want honest,
I'm an artist.

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:20.490
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: [laughs]

00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:21.490
[laughter]

00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:22.490
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: You guys want me to be honest
here.

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:23.490
[laughter]

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:24.490
I don't know I mean.

00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:25.490
You know what's interesting though is, ah
you don't even want me to talk about it, it

00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:26.490
doesn't matter.

00:31:26.490 --> 00:31:27.490
I don't know.

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:28.490
Thor.

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:29.490
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: There you go, Thor.

00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:30.490
[laughter]

00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:31.490
Go with that.

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:32.490
[laughter]

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:33.490
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: He's so good looking --

00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:34.490
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: [laughs]

00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:35.490
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Brad Pitt, strong.

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:36.490
[laughter]

00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:37.490
&gt;&gt;female #1: Thank you.

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:38.490
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: [laughs]

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:39.490
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: You think he's got those lines
right there?

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:40.490
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: [laughs]

00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:41.490
[laughter]

00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:42.490
&gt;&gt;female #2: Hey guys thanks for coming today.

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:43.490
I think a lot of us probably grew up listening
to music and I was wondering if people have

00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:47.590
kind of grown up as you guys have grown up
or if your fan base has like remained younger

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:48.590
and --

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:49.590
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: It's been both.

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:50.590
&gt;&gt;female #2: [responds off mic]

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:53.710
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Actually one of the best things
about coming back out on the road right now

00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:57.690
is that we are seeing people who have been
following blink since day one come out to

00:31:57.690 --> 00:32:02.110
the shows, we have seen new people come out
to the shows, it's like parents are bringing

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:06.500
their kids, older brothers are bringing their
younger siblings, it's like a multi-generational

00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:07.500
thing at the shows now.

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.240
It's really cool.

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:13.050
That being said, I got a note from a mom the
other day who brought her 14 year old daughter

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:14.050
to the show in Atlanta --

00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:15.050
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: She probably was not happy.

00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:19.809
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: and was very upset with what
she heard us say from the stage and I actually

00:32:19.809 --> 00:32:23.730
wanted to email her but I have no way to contact
her back, but I understand where she's coming

00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:26.730
from but why the hell would you bring your
14 year old kid to a blink show?

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:27.730
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Yeah well --

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:30.580
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: At least know what you're brining
your 14 year old kid to.

00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:33.170
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Well that's what's weird to
me too.

00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:36.160
She must have been the one, or maybe the kid
just barely heard about it and said, "Mom

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.160
take me."

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:40.330
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Well apparently the kid had
saved up her money by working at a job all

00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:41.630
summer to come to the show and then --

00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:42.870
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: That's too bad.

00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:43.870
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: was really upset.

00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:44.870
But it was just the language.

00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:48.140
I'm, like, look past that and look at the
art.

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:49.140
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Yeah.

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:50.140
&gt;&gt;female #2: [chuckles]

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:51.140
[laughter]

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:52.140
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: This is what we're doing up
there.

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:53.140
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: I know yeah.

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:54.140
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: But yeah it's a multi-generational
thing --

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:55.140
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: We have lasers.

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:56.140
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Yeah we do have lasers.

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:57.140
[laughter]

00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:58.140
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: And I mean we might be talking
about some really bad stuff but there's lasers.

00:32:58.140 --> 00:32:59.140
[laughter]

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:00.140
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Yeah.

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:01.140
[laughter]

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:02.140
&gt;&gt;female #2: Thanks guys.

00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:03.140
[pause]

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:04.140
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: I burned my eye out with a
laser on this tour.

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:05.140
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: That is true, he did.

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:06.140
&gt;&gt;male #5: Hey guys.

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:07.140
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: In Milwaukee.

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:08.140
&gt;&gt;male #5: Oh sorry.

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:09.140
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Go ahead.

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:11.630
&gt;&gt;male #5: So we've been talkin' about the
Internet a lot and how you guys have been

00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:15.230
a band that's kinda spanned from before the
Internet and then after and how that's changed

00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:16.230
music.

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:20.191
What I was wondering has that kinda changed
the way that you, I guess, go about making

00:33:20.191 --> 00:33:25.100
an album in terms of putting the focus away
from making a complete album more towards

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:29.550
like singles and like making a video straight
to YouTube or do you think that it's changed

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:33.919
the way that fans have kind of like looked
at your albums and more taking single songs

00:33:33.919 --> 00:33:36.520
and does that change the way you guys do things
at all or?

00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:39.059
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: It doesn't change the way that
we do anything at all.

00:33:39.059 --> 00:33:44.480
I recognize the fact that there are some people
who listen to a full album still and when

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:49.860
we sequence our album we think a lot about
like a song flowing into the next song and

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:53.850
how like the different keys of songs and different
tempos and different feelings of songs so

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:55.380
you can sit down listen to a record as a whole.

00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:58.750
I also appreciate that people wanna pick and
choose different songs.

00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:01.670
It's the same as making mixed tape back in
the day.

00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:07.140
I think it puts a lot more onus on the band
to create 10 or 12 great songs.

00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:11.271
I think that the days of getting by with having
like three or four good songs on a record

00:34:11.271 --> 00:34:13.230
and the rest of it be filler is long gone.

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:15.669
&gt;&gt;male #5: Because then people just buy --

00:34:15.669 --> 00:34:17.070
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Yeah people will just not buy
the filler.

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:21.030
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: I think there consum-, I think
fans consumption is like what you said though

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:25.200
where I mean one way it's changed for us we
have two studios operating so we're using

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:28.359
the Internet to pass around ideas and we're
usin' the Internet to communicate with each

00:34:28.359 --> 00:34:31.050
other to have two studios operating at the
same time.

00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:34.320
And I also think that like what we were talkin'
about in some of the other questions where

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:39.300
in the sense where fans can consume and get
introduced to the art in so many different

00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:40.679
ways.

00:34:40.679 --> 00:34:46.129
And at the end of the day like Mark said we
wanna do albums but we'll still be excited

00:34:46.129 --> 00:34:48.370
if anybody just wants to take a chance with
one thing that they really like.

00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:49.370
&gt;&gt;male #5: Thanks you guys.

00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:50.370
[pause]

00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:51.670
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Hello.

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:56.929
&gt;&gt;female #3: Hi guys, oh this is really high.

00:34:56.929 --> 00:34:57.929
[laughs]

00:34:57.929 --> 00:34:59.609
Tom I have a question specifically for you.

00:34:59.609 --> 00:35:04.800
My friend, Andrew Lee, from Northwestern University
is obsessed with you and --

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:05.800
[laughter]

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:07.200
he wants to know --

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:08.930
[laughter]

00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:13.900
he wants to know what your experience doing
Angels and Airwaves and how it has been different

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:14.900
from blink.

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:21.620
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Well Angels and Airwaves we
have, I'm able to, we're so small that there's

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:27.320
not really, there's nothing that we're gonna
do that might impact old or necessarily new

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.320
fans.

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:31.840
We don't really know what we're doing [chuckles].

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:34.170
I guess with blink we're always conscious.

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:39.570
What I did learn was by both, what I really
like about it is I always tell people I get

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:46.930
to play on one part I get to do things that
are extremely unorthodox and pretend that

00:35:46.930 --> 00:35:52.350
I'm cerebral and the other way I get to be
the kid that I always wanted to be and always

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:56.320
maintained being eternal youth, the spirit
of having that angst.

00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:01.970
So having them both be around at the same
time I try to bleed some of those things over

00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:07.420
on both sides where I kinda go, "Wow, I really
was able to learn how not to forget who I

00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:10.550
was and also to remember about kinda who I
wanna be."

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:11.820
But I'm also into that kind of stuff.

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:13.600
So some guy was asking me earlier about what
we collect.

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:16.609
I like, I read a lot of books, that's probably
the only thing that I collect is books where

00:36:16.609 --> 00:36:21.850
I try to spend a lot of time becoming a better
person.

00:36:21.850 --> 00:36:26.920
But that's really bad because I got bad judgment
so don't think that's it's really happening.

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:31.990
But I try to have that come into the art I
really try to have that lyrically.

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:37.330
I was in a different place on the blink record
like approaching lyrics with blink now it's

00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:41.990
like I really was able to find out a little
bit more of who I am and like that song Wishing

00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:45.990
Well has got a little bit of spirit of me
tryin' to be a little bit of a philosopher

00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:47.940
in some ways but I don't know.

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:49.400
But that's a good question.

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:50.400
[pause]

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.740
&gt;&gt;female #3: Alright, thank you.

00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:54.070
&gt;&gt;male in audience: One more question.

00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:56.020
&gt;&gt;female #4: Hi guys, thanks --

00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:57.190
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Hello.

00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:58.740
&gt;&gt;female #4: for coming.

00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:00.670
My name's Kristen and my heart is pounding,
my heart is pounding like crazy right now.

00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:02.300
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: We're handsome, we know.

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:03.300
[laughter]

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:06.950
&gt;&gt;female #4: So I have to admit I came up
here without a question in mind and I have

00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:09.470
one now but my high school self would have
killed me if I didn't at least say hi to you.

00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:10.540
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Hello.

00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:11.610
&gt;&gt;female #4: Hi.

00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:12.670
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: [laughs]

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:17.070
&gt;&gt;female #4: My question is my favorite album
to listen to in high school was the Live Album

00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:18.160
'cause it was so funny.

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:19.160
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Um-hum.

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:21.050
&gt;&gt;female #4: What was your favorite album
to record?

00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:23.000
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Oh.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.359
Well I don't know it's probably, they were
all rad.

00:37:27.359 --> 00:37:31.890
I remember the first time with Jerry Finn
on Enema of the State was such an incredible

00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:32.890
experience.

00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:33.890
Everything sounded so good --

00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:34.890
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Yeah.

00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:35.890
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: and everything.

00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:37.950
That was like the first time I really felt
like were attacking it in a really professional

00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:38.950
manner.

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:42.119
But then the How, the self titled one where
we holed up in a house for nine months was

00:37:42.119 --> 00:37:45.710
incredible too 'cause that was the first time
we ever like had a laboratory to experiment

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:46.710
in.

00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:47.710
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Yeah.

00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:48.710
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: You know.

00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:51.420
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: I think that, I think that
Enema of the State was our first introduction

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:52.790
into proper recording.

00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:55.230
We just had a lot of fun.

00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:59.520
Our producer Jerry Finn is one of the funniest
guys that I've ever met in my life, that's

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:01.420
where we first watched the Family Guy.

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:03.050
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Was on that record?

00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:05.170
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Was it, or maybe it was the
next one.

00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:06.170
Oh.

00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:07.170
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: He brought some good things.

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:08.170
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Yeah he brought some good things
into the world.

00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:12.460
I feel like on the last record was really
about us experimenting and trying different

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:15.390
ideas and feeling free to push ourselves.

00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:17.790
And this record was more like relaxed --

00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:18.900
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: Yeah, really relaxed.

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:22.580
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: than anything, probably because
we took two years to do it.

00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:27.410
[laughs] So they're all great experiences
in their own way I think that we all learn

00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:28.870
something at each recording.

00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:32.820
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: That's actually really good
point like this record, everyone wants to

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:37.370
think that it might have been really hard
or holed up so, I mean we really had a great

00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:39.300
time on this so there's really, it really
was relaxed.

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:42.950
It took a while but there was no pressure
we just did our thing and really had fun doin'

00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:43.950
it.

00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:45.740
Versus previous records it was always like
you always feel like it's your last record.

00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:46.740
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: Yeah.

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:49.040
&gt;&gt;Tom DeLonge: And you go into the studio
you go, "Oh my God we hope the label likes

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:50.040
this one."

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:51.040
We didn't have any of that on that.

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:55.120
So this latest record without the pressure
was, made it so much easier than so many of

00:38:55.120 --> 00:39:00.970
the other ones but the other ones were benchmarks
in our career like for all those reasons we

00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:01.970
were sayin'.

00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:02.970
[pause]

00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:04.800
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: You just made the mark like,
"You're dead."

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:05.800
[laughter]

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:08.500
He pointed at you and he goes like this.

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:09.500
[laughter]

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:10.500
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: Well --

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:11.500
[laughter]

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:12.500
that's all the time we have.

00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:15.450
Obviously thank you so much Tom and Mark for
coming and visiting and talking with us.

00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:16.900
&gt;&gt;Mark Hoppus: I wanna give you credit.

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:20.220
You were my kind of introduction into the
whole Google world right as I signed up I

00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:25.000
had a question about doing a Hangout or something
and Jonathan you popped in and answered it

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.000
right away.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.550
And I think that's really cool, I mean, I've
never had that on any other service where

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:33.150
