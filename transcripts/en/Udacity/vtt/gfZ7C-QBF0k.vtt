00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.210
We've got our new data frame so let's make use of it. I want you

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.260
to plot the ratio of females to males

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.570
to determine how many times more friends the

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.810
average female user has, compared to the number

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.100
of friends the average male user has. You'll

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.210
also add some cool features to the plot,

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.320
but I'll describe that in the programming exercise.
