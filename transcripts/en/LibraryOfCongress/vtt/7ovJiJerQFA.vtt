00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C..

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.990
&gt;&gt; Ladies and Gentlemen.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.360
A video message from
the fourteenth Librarian

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.610
of Congress, Carla Hayden.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.030
&gt;&gt; Dr. Carla Hayden: Good
evening, and thank you

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.580
for joining the Library
on this special night.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.690
Remembering Denis Johnson,

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.290
recipient of the 2017
Prize for American Fiction.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.630
I'm sorry I can't
be there with you.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.590
But I know it will be a
memorable conversation

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.360
with these extraordinary
authors.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.370
The Library of Congress honors
a writer's lifetime achievement.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.670
The Fiction Prize,

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.660
at the National Book
Festival each year.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.420
So I didn't want to miss
the opportunity to share

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.970
with you some news
about this year's event.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.710
On Saturday, September 1.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.280
Once again, this
celebration of books

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.250
and reading will feature some

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.560
of the biggest names
in every genre.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.760
In History, I'm thrilled to
announce that former Secretary

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.840
of State, Madeleine
Albright, will join us.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.180
Also Doris Kearns Goodwin, John
Meacham, and Ron [inaudible].

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.320
Best-selling author Amy Tan
will discuss her new memoir.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.620
Where the Past Begins.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.090
Dave Eggers, Jennifer Egan,

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.650
and Isobel Liende
will all be with us.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.040
And children's author

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.190
and Pulitzer Prize winner
Junot Diaz will join us.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.890
Our US Poet Laureate Tracy K.
Smith, and National Ambassador

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.280
for Young People's Literature,

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.700
Jacqueline Woodson
will be there too.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.660
This is just a hint
at the things to come.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.320
More names will be
announced soon.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.620
I hope to see you there.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.430
&gt;&gt; Please welcome the
Director of National

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.510
and International
Outreach, Dr. Jane McAuliffe.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:13.050
[ Applause ]

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.350
&gt;&gt; Dr. Jane McAuliffe:
Good evening.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.930
As you've just heard, I'm
Jane McAuliffe, the Director

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.400
of National and International
Outreach here at the Library.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.430
On behalf of all of my
colleagues, it's a pleasure

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.980
to welcome you to Stories
from a Fallen World.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.240
The Library of Congress' Prize

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.800
for American Fiction
Tribute to Denis Johnson.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.380
Tonight is the third in what
has become an annual celebration

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.590
of the prize and its winners.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.480
And I know that we all
find pleasure in the fact

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.160
that in today's hectic world.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.360
We can pause and take an
evening to recognize the power

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.900
of literature to
change our perceptions.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.260
Along with our Poet Laureate,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.710
the prize for American
Fiction stands

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.790
as the Library's highest
honor to an American writer.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.810
It seeks to commend strong,
unique, enduring voices

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.850
who have told us something new
about the American experience.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.920
Denis Johnson certainly
deserves the honor.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.660
As last year's prize winner,

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.620
Marilynne Robinson
has said about him.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.970
"I have never known a writer who
was so identical with his work.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.350
Whose thoughts and passions
and energies were so entirely

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:39.250
of one substance with the
world he remade as fiction."

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.420
The great energy of his
imagination was a fusion

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.330
of honesty and seriousness.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.520
Pain and laughter.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.700
His life was a thing of
the moment and urgency,

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.940
pure and undistracted.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.060
Denis left us too soon, but
we have an amazing group

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.970
of his writing peers,
literary and journalistic.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.240
Here with us tonight to help
celebrate his life and work.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.890
It should be a fascinating
discussion that reflects

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.050
in strikingly different
ways the gritty themes

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.380
that course through his stories.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.550
Before we get started, I'd like
to recognize Cindy Johnson,

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.690
Denis' widow, and his
daughter, Lana Burke.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.330
We're so very glad that you
could join us this evening.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.070
I'd also like to recognize Avida
Basharad [assumed spelling],

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.690
Deputy Publisher
of Random House.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.930
Random House is the proud
publisher of Denis' work.

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.460
Now please let me welcome
my colleague John Haskell

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.760
to the stage.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.080
To tell you just a bit about
one of our hosts this evening.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.530
The John W. Kluge Center
here at the Library.

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.510
Thank you.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:58.610
[ Applause ]

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:59.910
&gt;&gt; John Haskell:
Thank you, Jane.

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.310
And thank you all for coming.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.150
The Kluge Center's proud to
be co-sponsor of this event.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.490
It's a continuation of a
collaboration we've had

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.120
with the Poetry and
Literature Center.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.300
To celebrate the winners in
the Prize for American Fiction.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.000
The tribute to this particular
literary giant fits perfectly

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.190
into the Kluge Center's mission.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.080
Which is to be a
bridge between scholars

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.890
and writers on the one hand.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.710
And policy makers and the
interested public on the other.

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.680
And that's to foster a
continuing conversation

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.920
of the challenges
facing democracies

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.920
in the twenty-first century.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.980
Before we get to the program, I
want to give a quick shout-out

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.300
to the National Endowment
to the Humanities.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.660
Who's gotten the word out to, to
a lot of you about this event.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.430
And also to thank them
for the work they do

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.710
in collaboration
with the Library.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.090
Right now we have a brief
video featuring Denis Johnson.

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.790
&gt;&gt; "English words
are like prisms.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.230
Empty, nothing inside.

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.340
And still they make rainbows."

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.090
So says a character
in Already Dead.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.190
A novel by the late, great
American writer, Denis Johnson.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.180
Johnson's stories, as
legions of his fans know.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.020
Are also prisms.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.360
They are hard, merciless,
flinty,

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.170
and yet they too make rainbows.

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:32.000
He's been called a
writer's writer's writer.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.930
And for all the enigma
of that string of words,

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.860
they hold a simple truth.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.980
Those who bring language
to life recognize Johnson's

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.390
gifts instantly.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:46.190
Louise Erdrich calls his work
"profound" and "transcendent."

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.970
Jonathan Franzen finds
his sentences "miracles

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:51.220
of transparency and tone."

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.590
Philip Roth calls him "daring,
terrifying, and an emissary

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:57.760
for tortured, broken souls."

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.700
Marilynne Robinson marvels that
a writer's personal passions

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.220
and energies can be

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:06.410
so inextricably wedded
to his words.

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:11.050
All agree Denis Johnson has
managed to give us minimalist

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:16.170
yet distinctly ecstatic and
hallucinatory rainbow prose.

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:18.440
He is an American original.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.850
He was born in 1949
in Munich, Germany.

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:24.950
And raised in Tokyo and Manila,
the child of American diplomats.

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:27.280
As a teenager, moving
back to Washington,

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.360
D.C. during the tumultuous
sixties,

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.970
he came to know the country
and the restless characters.

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:35.120
He would capture so
vividly in his fiction.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.710
He graduated in English
Literature

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:38.380
from the University of Iowa.

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:41.240
And earned an MFA from
the Iowa Writers' Workshop

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.570
where he returned as a teacher.

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:45.500
He has also taught at
Texas State University.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.280
And the University
of Texas at Austin.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.780
In the course of his fevered
career, he published novels,

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.310
short stories, journalism,
and poetry.

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:58.260
Among his best-known works
are those about the flotsam

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.140
and jetsam of American life.

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:01.960
The Laughing Monsters.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.960
Nobody Move.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.530
Tree of Smoke.

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:07.120
Already Dead.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.650
Jesus' Son.

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:12.750
Resuscitation of a Hanged
Man, The Stars at Noon.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.430
Fiskadoro.

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:17.310
Angels. He's received
numerous award for these,

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:21.380
including a National Book award,
a Lannan Fellowship in Fiction,

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:26.280
a Whiting Writers' Award, and
in 2008 he was named a finalist

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.670
for the Pulitzer Prize.

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:30.090
Throughout, he had
chronicled an America

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:33.290
that has gone unobserved,
unrecorded.

00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:38.280
Here are our drug addicts, our
war veterans, our disaffected.

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:41.490
Our used up and left behind.

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:44.820
And yet the most affecting
and rewarding aspect

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:46.860
of Denis Johnson's fiction.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.620
Is that in work after
work he has proved

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:53.450
that beauty often lurks
in unexpected places.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:55.910
That strength can
be found in failure.

00:08:55.910 --> 00:09:00.390
That the human spirit is a
fragile but resilient vessel.

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:03.830
His is a very American story.

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:07.240
He once described his works as
pressure cookers of language.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:11.100
His characters as those who
inhabit life's perilous edge.

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.510
As time wore on, he found

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:15.060
that he himself was
all too vulnerable

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.500
to these human frailties.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.400
When the Librarian of
Congress, Carla Hayden,

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.420
offered Denis Johnson the
Library of Congress Prize

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:26.180
for American Fiction
in March of 2017.

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:29.520
He wrote in an email
message, "My head is spinning

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.580
from such great news."

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:35.580
Two months later,
tragically, he was dead.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:36.880
The Library is very proud

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.090
to honor posthumously this
extraordinary human being

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:41.950
and writer whose contributions

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:45.480
to the American canon have
been lasting and invaluable.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.070
As the Librarian wrote when
the prize was announced

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:53.320
in June 2017, "Denis Johnson
was a writer for our times.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:56.210
In prose that fused
grace with grit.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:59.680
He spun tale after tale
about our walking wounded,

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:03.100
the demons that haunt,
the salvation we seek.

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:07.350
We emerge from his imagined
world with profound empathy,

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:09.970
a different perspective,
a little changed."

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:13.340
We are very proud to count Denis
Johnson among the distinguished

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:14.980
winners of the Library

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:18.510
of Congress Prize
for American Fiction.

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:23.510
[ Music ]

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:42.040
[ Applause ]

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.360
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Good
evening, Ladies and Gentlemen.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.920
My name is Marie Arana.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:50.030
And I have the privilege
of serving as the Literary

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:55.220
of Congress and to the Librarian
of Congress, Dr. Carla Hayden.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:58.770
One of my most rewarding
responsibilities is directing

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:02.690
the jury that governs
this distinguished award.

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:06.330
The Library of Congress
Prize for American Fiction.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:09.410
In that capacity, I get to
work with wonderful scholars

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:10.720
like the ones you've just heard.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:14.300
Jane McAuliffe, and John
Haskell, as well as the head

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.240
of the Poetry and
Literature Center,

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:20.450
Rob Casper whom you'll meet
at the end of the program.

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:25.000
Every year a jury of 27
distinguished literary critics,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.020
Nobel Laureates in Literature,
Man Booker Award winners.

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:34.590
Former winners of this prize put
forward three American authors

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:36.690
they think most deserving.

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:40.440
The Librarian of Congress
makes the final selection.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.050
The purpose of that
award is spelled

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:45.180
out on the back of
your programs.

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:49.840
Is to commend strong,
unique, enduring voices.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.140
That throughout long,

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.280
consistently accomplished
careers,

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:57.800
have told us something new
about the American experience.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:02.280
Past awardees have been
Herman Wouk, Philip Roth,

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:08.590
Isabel Allende, Don DeLillo,
E.L. Doctorow, Louise Erdrich,

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:13.620
John Grisham, Marilynne
Robinson, and Toni Morrison.

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:19.640
The choice of our tenth
prize winner, Denis Johnson,

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:22.850
made by Dr. Hayden in
March of last year.

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:27.050
And then confirmed in a
prize ceremony in September.

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:31.330
Was especially thrilling for
me, as I've been a dedicated fan

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:35.420
of Denis' work since I
stumbled onto Resuscitation

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:38.410
of a Hanged Man, back
in the early nineties.

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:41.440
When I was a little
younger than I am now.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:45.220
And found myself bowled
over by his language,

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.610
its emotional force.

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:49.860
Its precision.

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:56.440
As one reviewer wrote, quote,
"His novels like poems seem

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.640
to be written line to line."

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.240
Unquote. But the full power

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:06.800
of his stories transcends even
his considerable prose mastery.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:11.540
Denis' stories land
like a swift punch,

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:15.480
somewhere between gut and heart.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:19.110
The last time I spoke to
Denis, it was on the phone.

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:22.940
Trying to persuade him
to be here tonight.

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:26.450
He had been so delighted by
Dr. Hayden's call and the news

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:28.890
that he was the chosen honorees.

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:33.820
I exchanged emails with
him just after that call.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:37.170
But he was also an
immensely private man.

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:41.290
He didn't like public
expressions of admiration.

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:43.750
Indeed he had been
conveniently away

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:46.920
in some war zone
reporting a story

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.860
when the National Book
Award was conferred

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.760
on his ten years before.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:57.260
For his devastatingly
powerful work, Tree of Smoke.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.600
I tried valiantly
to argue my case

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.020
that he should join us here.

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:03.950
That he didn't need to do much.

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:06.960
Just come, sit out there in
the audience with all of you

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.650
and be lauded and celebrated.

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:11.100
And given his due for being one

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:16.130
of the great American
literary figures of our time.

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:17.810
He was polite.

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:19.520
He was friendly.

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:22.660
He let me talk and talk.

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:23.960
[Laughter] That phone call

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:26.240
which lasted a good long
while, as I remember.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.230
And during which I felt
with every passing minute

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:32.430
that my powers of
persuasion were failing me.

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:37.560
Ended with, "Umm,
I don't think so."

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.510
[Laughter] He just couldn't
bring himself to do it.

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:45.030
That was on May 18, 2017.

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:48.530
Six days later, he was gone.

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:54.900
Now we're here, gathering
to honor him in his absence.

00:14:57.090 --> 00:15:00.520
Thinking about how best
to celebrate Denis.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:05.490
We decided that might please him
most, given his gimlet-eyed view

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:07.990
of public expressions
of admiration.

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:12.690
Might be to turn our lights
in the other direction.

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:17.850
We decided to pay tribute to him
by honoring others in his name.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:22.210
Choosing three exemplary
American writers whose works

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:25.140
reflect in one way or
another the themes that are

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:28.200
so present in Denis' work.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:31.720
They would be excellent writers
at the top of their form.

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.720
Very different practitioners
of the craft.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:38.350
Three greats who, like
Denis, tell stories,

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:40.670
fiction or nonfiction.

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.090
Excuse me.

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:47.870
Stories of a Fallen World.

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:51.340
The human costs of
addiction, for instance.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:54.180
The terrible fog of war.

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:58.210
The essential alienation
and disconnectedness

00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:01.280
that define modern-day America.

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:04.410
If we do this right, tonight
you'll see a little bit

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:08.560
of Denis and his obsessions.

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:12.160
In all three of these
brilliant wordsmiths.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.570
I'd like to tell you
something about each.

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:17.880
Right up front, right
here before we sit down.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.360
In reverse order of
their appearance.

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.460
So that when I actually
bring them on,

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.790
the last shall be the first.

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:28.440
Let me start in that
spirit with someone

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.060
who will actually
follow the writers.

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:34.660
She is Elizabeth Cuthrell, a
very accomplished film producer

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:37.840
who wrote and produced the
film version of Jesus' Son

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:44.660
that stark, searing, often
funny, quirkily funny collection

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:48.080
of stories for which Denis
is probably best known.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:51.200
Elizabeth is co-founder
of Evenstar Films.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:54.050
An independent film and
theater production company.

00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:56.620
She's turned out numerous
prize-winning movies as well

00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:00.000
as acclaimed theater
productions on both coasts.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.130
She also produced a
stunning series of,

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:03.970
of public service announcements.

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:06.380
Called Stop the Hate.

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:08.930
You're urging racial tolerance,

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:12.510
for which she won
the Courage Award.

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:17.060
We're especially thankful, very
grateful to Elizabeth for coming

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:22.520
to share with us her long-time
friendship with Denis Johnson.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:29.260
Sam Quinones is the author of
Dreamland, a true masterpiece

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.450
of journalism about
the opioid crisis

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:34.220
and the widespread addiction

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:38.330
that has ravaged small town
America and the heartland.

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:44.300
His book is powerful, absorbing,
urgent, a monumental achievement

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:48.600
that drills down on the harsh
realities that Denis described

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.860
so memorably in fiction.

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:53.230
The winner of the National
Book Critics' Circle Award,

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:56.600
a finalist for the
L.A. Times Book Prize.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:00.080
And named one of the
best books of 2015,

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:04.840
it's a book every
American should read.

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:07.650
A book that tracks a
spiraling drug trade.

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:12.200
A voracious, unfettered
pharmaceutical industry.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:17.090
And hundreds of thousands of
lives strewn along the way.

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:20.370
We're very lucky to have
Sam with us tonight.

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:24.980
Elliott Ackerman, a United
States Marine served five tours

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:26.280
of duty in Iraq.

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:29.750
And Afghanistan, and is the
recipient of the Silver Star,

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:33.650
the Bronze Star for valor,
and the Purple Heart.

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:36.900
His essays and short stories
have appeared in the New Yorker,

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.780
the Atlantic, the New
Republic, among many others.

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:44.400
His first book, Green on
Blue, is a harrowing, brutal,

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:48.490
utterly absorbing novel about
an Afghan orphan trapped

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:51.630
in the savage fog of war.

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:54.770
Elliot's second novel,
Dark at the Crossing,

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:56.540
published just last year.

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.020
Is about a young
Arab American caught

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:01.290
in the Syrian conflagration.

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:04.630
The novel was a finalist
for the National Book Award.

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:07.680
And named one of the
best books of 2017.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:11.270
He'll publish a new novel this
fall called Waiting for Eden

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:14.040
about an American
veteran home from the war.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:19.410
Drastically damaged in
mind, spirit, and body.

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:22.450
Elliot, it's great
to have you here.

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:25.090
Jonathan Franzen, our
first guest tonight,

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:27.630
is renowned for plumbing
the depths

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:30.910
of the modern American psyche.

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:34.730
He is a past master of the
essential loneliness and anxiety

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:36.570
that permeates contemporary
life.

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:42.670
And the wild, careening twists
of fate that can throw it all

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:46.030
out of whack, and
send it spinning.

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:48.860
Jon's talent for forming
striking narratives

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:53.000
out of ordinary life is
abundantly evident in his work.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.020
Most recently in his richly
imagined novel, Purity.

00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:59.930
Which has been called
his most fleet-footed,

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:03.050
intimate novel yet.

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:06.550
"If some authors are
masters of suspense,

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:09.180
others post-modern
verbal acrobats,"

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:10.740
Publisher's Weekly wrote.

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:15.050
"And still others complex
character pointillists,

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:18.780
few excel in all three arenas."

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:20.810
Jon is the authors
of four other novels.

00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:24.200
Among them, Freedom
and the Corrections,

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.600
for which he won a
National Book Award.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.700
And numerous other prizes.

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:32.310
And five works of
nonfiction and translation.

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:36.510
Ladies and gentlemen, will you
please welcome Jonathan Franzen?

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:49.060
[ Applause ]

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:52.610
So I'd like to start
with a quote, Jon.

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:54.410
If everyone can hear me.

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:55.710
Can I, can I be heard?

00:20:55.710 --> 00:21:01.230
Yes? This is from Sam
Tanenhaus at the New York Times.

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:04.260
He said, "Franzen cracks
open the opaque shell

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.210
of postmodernism.

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:09.290
Tweezes out its tangled
circuitry,

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:13.240
and inserts in its place,
the warm beating heart

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:15.370
of an authentic humanism."

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:18.510
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Franzen:
That was nice of Sam.

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:21.740
[ Laughter ]

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:25.490
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: "He writes with
equal fluency on equity finance,

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:29.110
railroad engineering, currency
manipulation in Eastern Europe.

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:32.050
The neurochemistry of
clinical depression.

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:34.370
But the data flows through
the arteries of narrative.

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:37.470
Attending to the quiet
drama of interior life

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:39.710
and recording its
fraught transactions

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:41.010
with a public world."

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:45.320
Now that is a pretty
big, tall order.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:50.010
Jon, you write about
dysfunctional families.

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:55.780
Small American worlds that are
exploded really by large events.

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:59.550
I think I can summarize
your work that way.

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:04.790
And the humdrum of, of quiet
lives that are suddenly ripped

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:08.680
to shreds by foreign
events or economic busts.

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.490
Or miscommunications.

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:11.790
Of happenstance.

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:17.510
What brings you to
those subjects?

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:23.270
[ Laughter ]

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:24.570
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Franzen:
Sheer desperation.

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:27.440
That's kind of what you face
every morning in the office.

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:33.410
First of all, thank
you all for coming.

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:37.280
I, I never do these things.

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:40.480
There's only one writer I
would have done this for.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:42.380
And that's Denis
Johnson because he has,

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:45.670
he has a unique place, actually.

00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:49.500
In the world of American
literature.

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:54.170
He's the one writer who every
writer I know can quote multiple

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:56.240
lines from verbatim.

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:58.540
They are often very funny lines.

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:00.820
Which is something I
hope we don't lose sight

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:04.670
of as Denis was one of the
funniest writers we had.

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:06.610
Laugh-out-loud funny.

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:11.070
Precisely because he was
so close to the edge.

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:13.230
So it's, it's an
honor to be here,

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:15.980
and I'm so glad Cindy
can be here too.

00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:18.970
So oh, yeah.

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:21.270
My work. [Clears throat]

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:28.550
It's autobiographical.

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:32.600
It's just to get at the
stuff that I'm interested in.

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:35.110
I, I, I'm very bad at
writing about myself.

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:36.600
I think there are
two kinds of writers.

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:39.730
One who can pretty much only
write about himself or herself.

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:44.430
And then the other kind
and I'm the other kind.

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:49.810
And I, I like a good story.

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:57.570
And typically, good stories are
about characters who want stuff.

00:23:57.570 --> 00:24:01.760
And also if they're anxious,
then the story might be funny.

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:04.160
And if, if I'm not laughing,

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.400
then I am just setting
those pages aside

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:09.730
and trying something else.

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:11.200
And I, and I guess, yes.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.410
And I always paid
attention to the news.

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:19.500
I had a dad who was very attuned
to, he was just, he'd had no,

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:20.990
he had no education really.

00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:23.000
Except, as a, as
a civil engineer.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.540
But he, he thought about stuff.

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:29.030
And you know, dinner table
conversation when I was growing

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:32.030
up would be what was
happening in the world.

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:33.560
So that just seemed natural.

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:36.020
And also it's nice if you have
a character who wants something

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:39.690
to put it, to put that character
in a recognizable world.

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:43.610
And I, it doesn't seem,
it just seems like yeah.

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:44.910
It's, it's what I do.

00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:48.760
That was a sort of
inarticulate response.

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:50.760
But the articulate
response would eat

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.800
up the rest of our time.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.100
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Well,

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:58.040
you're pretty articulate
on the page, Jon.

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:00.460
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Franzen:
Where it counts.

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:01.760
[Laughter]

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.060
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Where it counts.

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:07.530
The but you, you, you
really do, I think,

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:10.990
more than many American writers

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:14.540
who are dealing perhaps
with, you know.

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:24.600
Plot-driven or, or shall we
say small domestic troubles.

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:26.950
That there is a sense
that, there is a sense

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:32.040
when you read Jonathan Franzen
that you are reading something

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:34.280
about this anxious age.

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:41.390
Something about a, a kind of
loss of connectivity that we've,

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:44.800
that we seem to have come to.

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.970
At least that's what
the critics say.

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:49.560
What do you say from your perch?

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:55.050
About what you're trying to do?

00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:57.180
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Franzen: Honestly,
I am trying to be funny.

00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:00.750
And I, and I find people who are
anxious very funny because I,

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:03.490
I feel that's the only way
to survive my own anxiety.

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:06.740
Is to step back and throw
it into somebody else,

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:08.040
and then laugh at that person.

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:13.990
So for instance, like
in the Corrections, I,

00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:18.080
I spent so I'm always looking
for a topic sentence that,

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.920
this is a little craft thing.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.360
I don't really have a character

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:25.040
until I can write a good topic
sentence about that character.

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.490
It all goes back to what we
were taught in seventh grade

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:29.830
about topic sentences.

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:32.110
It turns out to be
really, really true.

00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:35.100
And it, and it can take
up to five years to come

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:37.990
up with a topic sentence for
a character for me [laughter].

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:41.020
But there was a character
in The Corrections, Gary,

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:44.750
who and it was a rather
elaborate topic sentence,

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:46.050
but it basically had to do with.

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:49.260
He had, there was all this
attention in the nineties

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:52.530
on clinical depression.

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:57.460
Which Prozac was the,
the miracle cure for.

00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:02.700
And he, he basically he
was trying to demonstrate

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:04.000
that he was not clinically.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.020
He was trying to do something in
order to demonstrate to his wife

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:09.010
that he was not clinically
depressed.

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:12.530
So that's, that was right
very much of the time.

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:15.030
And there were, people
were having conversations--

00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:16.330
it became.

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:17.630
Instead of saying, "I don't,

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:18.930
I wish you would take the trash
out, or I wish you would clean

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:20.320
up after dinner more."

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:21.760
They would say, "You
have a problem,

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.060
You're clinically depressed."

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:24.390
And then the other
person would say, "No,

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:25.690
I'm not clinically depressed.

00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:28.990
You're clinically depressed."

00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:32.890
[Laughter] And so
it was hilarious

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:34.200
but those were real fights.

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.470
And I had been in one myself.

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:38.270
It was like-- .

00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:41.250
[ Laughter ]

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:45.020
Yeah, so it's like
okay, well now I kind

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:46.330
of got a handle on this guy.

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:49.910
That the, and, and yes,
it does, it does draw

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:52.500
in what's happening
in the world.

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.630
Because why not?

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:56.010
It's fun. Yeah.

00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:58.450
I, I mean, I'm an entertainer.

00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:00.280
I'm looking for what's fun.

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.790
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: So
let me ask you now.

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:07.140
Talking about real life because
one of the things that I,

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:10.890
I think would be
really interesting

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:13.080
to explore particularly
with your work.

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:17.110
Is the, is the way that
fiction in some ways gets

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:24.380
across a reality better than
sometimes nonfiction can.

00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:28.530
What does fiction in
your mind, what does it,

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:30.890
how does it do that
for a society?

00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:32.190
How does it feed us?

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:35.800
How does it, how does it
nurture us in that sense?

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:37.360
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Franzen: I
actually think the people

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:41.660
who read Denis Johnson-level
fiction are the lucky ones.

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:44.830
And I don't mean
economically the lucky ones.

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:46.130
I mean just lucky.

00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:47.430
Something is going right

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:49.990
if you can actually sustain
attention in a novel.

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:54.360
If you're really, really
miserable, you can't do that.

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:57.040
And in the prison population,
there are the readers,

00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.360
and those are the lucky ones.

00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:05.220
In any population it's,
it's actually so if you,

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:07.520
if you could enjoy a book.

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:10.340
You should pause for a
moment with gratitude

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:11.640
that you're able to do that.

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:12.940
Because a lot of people can't.

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:14.240
If you can enjoy a
complicated dark book,

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.330
that laughs at other things,

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:20.600
at things other people
might find terrible.

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:22.260
Then you're really,
really lucky.

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:25.530
But that, but that is actually
almost a definition of,

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:28.120
of what we call literature.

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:31.480
Is that kind of cosmic
distance on stuff.

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:34.810
If you're really down in the
trenches, you can't do that.

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:41.670
Oh yeah, so I think of, I talk
a lot about the metamorphosis,

00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:45.460
Kafka's novel about Gregor
Samsa who wakes up one morning

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:47.210
and finds that he's an insect.

00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:52.670
He could have done a memoir, a
sort of midstream memoir talking

00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:55.140
about how crappy it was to
live at home with his parents.

00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:58.210
And not even have
the good bedroom,

00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:00.670
even though he was
the son and so forth.

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:03.910
[Laughter] As a grown
man, you know,

00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:05.330
he's been working
a job for years.

00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:07.950
And there he is at
home with the parents.

00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:13.330
And he could have
probably gotten across some

00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:16.040
of why he found that a drag.

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:21.500
But to get at really the
degree to which he experienced

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:27.790
that as unbelievably
terrible, he made up a story.

00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:29.090
He invented something.

00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:32.860
And, and also in the, in the
process, good thing for fiction,

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:34.160
he protected his family.

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:37.190
Because [laughter] everyone knew

00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:41.680
that the Kafka's did not
have a large bug for a son.

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:45.880
So they, the parents
said, "Oh, it's not us."

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:49.030
[Laughter] How could that be us?

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:53.600
Franz is a little weird,
but he's not an insect.

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:59.020
[Laughter] So and I think
that broadly speaking,

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:00.840
that's a metaphor for
what fiction does.

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:06.030
Is it, it enables you
to, to go, to exaggerate

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:14.770
in these wild ways that, that
mere representation of reality.

00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:18.600
The states of mind, states,
emotional states and lots

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:21.900
of other kinds of states.

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:26.620
That mere factual
representation simply cannot.

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:27.920
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Yeah.

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:30.800
Of course that brings me,
you're, you're, you're talking

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:35.400
about the, the ways
that fiction works.

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:40.800
I mean, the humor in fiction
which, which Denis used

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:44.350
so superbly in the
middle the darkest sort

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:46.480
of funkiest moments.

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:50.220
It would, you would find
it screamingly funny.

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:52.670
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Franzen: His word
choice in a Fatal Accident,

00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:54.260
the first story in Jesus' Son.

00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:59.560
Even I think, I think, when
the, when the car crash happens,

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:03.420
the woman says, "No," the
woman said viciously."

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:04.890
Like that word viciously.

00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:11.750
Which is like a head-on
crash is about to occur.

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:19.070
Yeah. That's, that tells me
he had resolved something.

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:24.260
And could see it from the kind
of perspective from which-- .

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:27.690
On the one hand, he's sort
of touching close to God.

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:28.990
And on the other hand,

00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:33.020
he's touching his,
it's all hilarious.

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:36.760
If you, if you get the new story
collection for no other reason,

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:38.540
there's a two and
a half page scene

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:43.250
of the narrator having
a knee examination.

00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:48.080
In surgical theater while
tripping on LSD that,

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:51.500
if there's any doubt that
he was a comic writer.

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:52.800
Yeah.

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:54.760
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: In
fact you, you,

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:58.970
you made a wonderful citation
at his prize ceremony.

00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:02.550
And I want to read
at least part of it.

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:06.110
You said, "His sentences at best
are miracles of transparency

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:07.730
and tone," which
we've already heard.

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:10.520
"Perfect in the way they inhabit
the page, but devoid of vanity

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:11.930
about their perfection.

00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:14.270
Always vivid in their
reference to the actual

00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:17.760
but also always conveying
something larger.

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:21.160
Their creator's own
self-knowledge and compassion

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:23.590
and sense of cosmic comedy.

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:27.720
The God I want to believe in
has a voice like Johnson's."

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:29.140
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Franzen: Right.

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:31.230
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: What is-- .

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:33.420
[Laughter]

00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:34.720
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Franzen:
Oh, I don't know.

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.180
Stress on "want to".

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:39.090
As in wish I could.

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:42.280
But yeah, if, I mean, if there
were a God who spoke like,

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:45.120
you know, in with that kind of.

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:49.390
I'm not going to try to
explicate that sentence.

00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:50.690
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Okay.

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:51.990
[Laughter] I think
what it meant-- .

00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:53.790
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Franzen: Thank you!

00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:58.120
[ Laughter ]

00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:59.420
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: If I may.

00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:00.940
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Franzen:
Absolutely may.

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:02.240
[Laughter]

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:04.350
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Is that
he really had a voice.

00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:06.040
I mean a very strong voice.

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:13.670
And it was, if, if, if we could
put a, if we could pinpoint

00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:17.210
that talent, it would be
that, that voice that he had.

00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:21.060
That was absolutely
unique and original.

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:25.200
As yours is, I would say.

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:33.640
That, that sense that, that
sense that you are in the hands

00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:39.810
of a really superb narrator
and you can't quite let go.

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:41.600
It's mesmerizing.

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:42.920
That voice.

00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:44.220
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Franzen:
Well thank you.

00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:45.520
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Is
that what you meant?

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:46.820
[Laughter]

00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:48.120
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Franzen: I was
not talking about myself.

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:49.420
I was talking about Denis.

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:51.720
But.

00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:54.720
Yeah.

00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:56.020
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Yeah.

00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:57.990
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Franzen: What was--

00:34:57.990 --> 00:35:00.800
I, I thought actually that
Marilynne put it nicely,

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:03.850
that there was, there is a
sense of a kind of unitary.

00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:06.240
That, that what he,
that the writing and,

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:09.530
and the person were
almost indistinguishable.

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:15.160
It strikes me and I think
our other two guests

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:19.440
who will soon join
me can speak to this.

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:22.710
He is somebody who might
very well not have survived.

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:27.420
He was, he was a kind
of messed up kid.

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:31.970
And had intimate knowledge with
these, you know, pretty violent

00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:35.460
and definitely addictive
situations.

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:41.850
And there is a, there is
a sense of at the core

00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:43.150
of I think all of his.

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:45.990
I, I was rereading The New
Stories on the way down here.

00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:49.560
And what, what the
whole book kind of feels

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:53.530
like a meditation--
not a meditation.

00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:55.040
It's, it's a representation

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:58.090
of the amazingness
of still being alive?

00:35:58.090 --> 00:36:03.770
So that there's something
about everything he wrote

00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:08.260
that is aware of the
proximity of death.

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:11.660
And that, that goes to in
that respect there's a,

00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:13.770
I think there's a kind of
subterranean connection

00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:15.510
with Flannery O'Connor
who in her, the greatest

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:20.480
of all of her great stories.

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:24.070
Good Man is Hard to Find,

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:26.430
she would have been a good woman
had there been someone there

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:28.510
to shoot her every
day of her life.

00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:31.540
[ Laughter ]

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:33.500
About the grandmother
in that story.

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:37.270
If you don't know the
story, go read it.

00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:40.400
Which is basically this is,
this was a trivial woman

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:45.690
who with a gun pointed at
her, suddenly found something.

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:48.870
And somehow, throughout
his career,

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:52.520
he managed to write the stuff
that felt right on that bubble

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:54.120
of there's a gun pointed at me.

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:56.230
Death is all around me.

00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:57.530
I've seen people die.

00:36:57.530 --> 00:36:59.980
I'm aware that I'm going to die.

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:03.510
And you know, there's
a line in the new book,

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:05.930
you know, "I like my wife.

00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:09.680
She's you know, clever
and rather attractive.

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:11.210
She can die any minute."

00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:13.710
And then he just says that.

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:15.010
It's like, and then
new paragraph,

00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:16.580
we're onto the rest
of the story.

00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:19.960
But that's, that seemed to me
kind of the essence of the work.

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:22.830
That's why, what makes
it so exciting is

00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:26.320
that there's always
death right there.

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:27.620
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Right there.

00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:28.920
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Franzen: Yeah.

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:30.220
Right there.

00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:31.520
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Well,
with death right there,

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:34.510
let's bring on Elliot Ackerman.

00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:45.140
[ Applause ]

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:46.440
So here's a quote.

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:47.740
&gt;&gt; Elliot Ackerman:
First of all,

00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:50.040
that might be my
favorite introduction.

00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:54.170
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Here, here's
a quote to accompany you

00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:55.470
to have you accompany us.

00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:58.340
As, as I did for Jon.

00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:00.360
This is from Ben Fountain,

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:03.200
who wrote a wonderful book
called Billy Lynn's Wonderful

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:05.640
Halftime Walk, if you know it.

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:08.560
And he wrote about Elliot this.

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:11.590
"Dark at the Crossing is every
bit as taut and harrowing

00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:13.290
as the place it depicts.

00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:16.190
A region where 15 years
of relentless war play

00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:20.090
out in filthy refugee camps
and upscale shopping malls.

00:38:20.090 --> 00:38:23.160
Elliot Ackerman has written
a brilliant, admirably,

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:26.660
merciless novel of broken
lives, broken places,

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:31.180
and good intentions gone awry."

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:34.460
Someone once said of you, if
I remember this correctly.

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:41.100
That they, they don't award
medals of valor for writing.

00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:45.880
But maybe they should to you.

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:51.090
There's a sense, Elliot, in
your books, both of them.

00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:53.090
That you have emerged
from the cauldron

00:38:53.090 --> 00:38:55.610
of hell to tell this story.

00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:59.100
How, this is going
to, this is going

00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:03.050
to make Jon's blood pressure
rise because I read somewhere

00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:04.680
that he hates this question.

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:06.130
I'm going to ask this question.

00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:10.350
How autobiographical
are these stories?

00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:12.500
In the sense that you
have lived through any--

00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:14.660
of course you've lived
through, through,

00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:16.050
through the hell of war.

00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:20.650
But to what extent
are these from life?

00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:22.850
&gt;&gt; Elliot Ackerman: Well,
I mean, you know, my,

00:39:22.850 --> 00:39:25.390
my first book is, is the story

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:27.400
of an Afghan who's
murdered by an American.

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:29.510
It's all told from the
perspective of the Afghan.

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:31.880
So that's not me.

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:36.430
And you know my, my second novel
takes place in southern Turkey

00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:38.170
around the Syrian civil
war and it's a love story.

00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:39.470
But those characters aren't me.

00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:43.780
However, they are deeply
informed by my experience.

00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:45.940
And I don't think I could
extricate my experiences

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:47.240
from the book.

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:48.650
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Right,
but there's a, there,

00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:54.400
there is a sense, I think,
especially in Green on Blue.

00:39:54.400 --> 00:40:02.010
That you are, you're not
sure what side is which.

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:05.300
It reminds me of revolutions

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:08.710
in which the sides keep
changing all the time.

00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:12.410
Because people see the
battle's going this way,

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:13.710
the battle's going that way.

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:15.840
And they're going to run to
whatever side is winning.

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:20.370
There's that, there's a, a,
that sense of divided loyalties

00:40:20.370 --> 00:40:22.300
or confused loyalties.

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:24.300
And the fog of it
all in a sense.

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:28.240
That, and that's clearly
something that you've seen.

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:30.400
&gt;&gt; Elliot Ackerman: I mean,
it's something that I've seen

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:32.170
and something that I admire.

00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:34.130
You know, in other
people's writing.

00:40:34.130 --> 00:40:35.920
It's something I admired
in Denis Johnson's writing.

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:40.110
You know, the ability to take
extremely complex political

00:40:40.110 --> 00:40:43.650
events and make them
feel extremely personal.

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:45.870
I think it's something
that, that fiction does.

00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:50.290
But then you get a, you know,
we were talking about you know,

00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:52.500
different sides of an issue.

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:53.800
You know, in a war.

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:55.100
Like for instance, there's a,

00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:57.450
what's the trope someone just
said to me the other day.

00:40:57.450 --> 00:40:59.960
Which is you know, you, maybe
it was said on television.

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:01.260
You don't really know a person

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:03.240
until you've been
divorced from them.

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:05.930
Which is you know like
that' probably true.

00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:09.360
You know I would append to that
you don't really know a person

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:10.660
until you know you've fought

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:13.230
on the opposite side
of a war from them.

00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:15.320
And so I think there's sort of,

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:16.870
and sometimes we'll see
you know, it's, you know,

00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:19.470
why are you so, you know
fascinated by the people

00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:20.880
on the other sides
of these conflicts?

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:23.510
Well in some ways they're the
people that you know the best

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:25.550
until you trot out
another tired trope.

00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:27.140
You know, write what you know.

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:30.120
And you know, and oftentimes you
know, you know them the best.

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:31.420
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Right.

00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:35.150
But I, I assume that in, in,
in particularly in, in Iraq

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:40.140
and Afghanistan you are
fighting alongside people who,

00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:42.150
who are of that land.

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:48.550
And with whom you have to,
you have to make bonds.

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:54.630
I mean one thing I think that
you've said so eloquently.

00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:58.550
Is that a Marine is
trained to kill, right?

00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:00.890
But he also has to
be trained to love.

00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:05.420
And why? Because he has to
throw himself in the line

00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:08.250
of fire for his buddy.

00:42:08.250 --> 00:42:10.320
For his compatriot.

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:15.250
For the person he's,
he's, he's fighting with.

00:42:15.250 --> 00:42:23.920
And that really interests me,
that notion of you know, you're,

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:27.170
you're essentially
falling in love with,

00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:32.690
or loving a person who,
whose life is at risk.

00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:37.160
And who may, who
will die or may die.

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:38.770
&gt;&gt; Elliot Ackerman: I think
it gets to sort of the,

00:42:38.770 --> 00:42:40.380
the topic of our panel here.

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:44.290
And what is very unique in
Johnson's work is that he is

00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:47.210
so often on the edge, or I
would say it's also almost

00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:52.310
like this extremely thin
membrane that is translucent

00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:53.830
when you're standing
there right up against.

00:42:53.830 --> 00:42:56.640
You know, issues,
particularly issues

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:58.050
of conflict, you know, in wars.

00:42:58.050 --> 00:42:59.500
And who are fascinated
by that subject.

00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:01.680
You know the difference
between, you know,

00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:04.530
love and violence
is so permeable.

00:43:04.530 --> 00:43:09.630
And so I mean I found
in my own experience.

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:11.150
I have found in my
own experience in war.

00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:14.120
Even some, some of the great
ironies is that you know people,

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:16.470
you know, are doing very,
very courageous things.

00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:17.770
Because they love one another.

00:43:17.770 --> 00:43:19.070
But the courageous things

00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:20.370
that they're doing are
incredibly violent.

00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:24.820
And so, so again, you're
constantly, you know, flipping.

00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:29.170
You know, permeating
that membrane.

00:43:29.170 --> 00:43:30.470
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Speaking
of membranes,

00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:34.770
the Darkness at the Crossing.

00:43:34.770 --> 00:43:39.660
Deal with, a, an Iraqi
who's actually born in Iraq,

00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:41.680
but he's an American citizen.

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:45.060
We can't but wonder
as we read it.

00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:49.070
And he wonders it himself,
where his loyalties lie.

00:43:49.070 --> 00:43:52.810
And what it means to
be true to oneself

00:43:52.810 --> 00:43:55.080
when you have two
identities at work.

00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:56.950
Two nationalities at work.

00:43:56.950 --> 00:44:00.190
Two, you know, loyalties.

00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:03.920
And how did you get
to that subject?

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:07.180
And how, how, how does that,
how did that come to you?

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:08.480
&gt;&gt; Elliot Ackerman: Well
you know, this character

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:11.840
who is an Arab American
basically decides he wants

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:18.240
to go cross into Syria to, to
fight for the Free Syrian Army.

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:21.040
And a lot of the book is about
unpacking his motivations.

00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:22.730
And actually kind of gets
to what Jon was just saying

00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:24.350
with the Flannery
O'Connor story.

00:44:24.350 --> 00:44:25.760
About needing the gun
pointed at your head.

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:27.760
Which also reminds
me of the great scene

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:29.800
in Stanley Kubrick's
Full Metal Jacket.

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:32.360
About Animal Mother, the machine
gunner in the Marine platoon.

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:34.510
And they say, you know,
Animal Mother's a great guy.

00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:36.160
He just needs someone to
throw hand grenades at him

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:38.760
for the rest of his life.

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:40.940
[Laughter] And so, you
know, this character,

00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:44.000
Harris [inaudible] is kind of
the, he's in the same position.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.480
But you know, and to
be honest with you.

00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:48.780
The, the, the thing
that was foremost

00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:50.600
in my mind wasn't anything that
happened to me in the wars.

00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:54.590
It was actually a
scene in Anna Karenina

00:44:54.590 --> 00:44:56.990
and the way Anna Karenina ends.

00:44:56.990 --> 00:44:59.450
And so and the spoiler alert--

00:44:59.450 --> 00:45:02.040
she throws herself in front of
a train and commits suicide.

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:05.820
[Laughter] But, but you know,
I always felt like reading

00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:07.920
that book and getting
[inaudible] at like Vronsky,

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:09.680
her lover, kind of
gets like a bad rap.

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:12.010
I feel like, you know, like the
world's been tough on Vronsky.

00:45:12.010 --> 00:45:14.440
And if you recall,
the last you ever hear

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:15.810
of Vronsky, he's been disgraced.

00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:17.110
He's an outcast from
society now.

00:45:17.110 --> 00:45:19.200
But the last we hear is like
you don't even see Vronsky.

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:20.500
You don't, you don't
see Vronsky.

00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:22.090
You're just told by
another character

00:45:22.090 --> 00:45:26.100
that Vronsky was last seen on
a train heading to the caucasus

00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:28.630
to rejoin his regiment.

00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:31.520
And they don't say why and
of course he's on a train.

00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:32.840
Anna just threw herself
in front of train.

00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:35.240
And you know, Tolstoy
doesn't tell you the reasons.

00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:38.930
But it always fascinated me
is you know he could be going

00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:40.390
to rejoin his regiment.

00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:43.760
Because he thinks that some you
know battlefield heroics will be

00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:46.370
the way he can redeem himself.

00:45:46.370 --> 00:45:49.570
And integrate again
into society.

00:45:49.570 --> 00:45:52.600
Okay, or he could be
going there to basically.

00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:55.650
He could be on that train for
the same reasons, you know,

00:45:55.650 --> 00:45:56.950
as Anna ended herself.

00:45:56.950 --> 00:45:58.480
He'll be going off to
war to kill himself.

00:45:58.480 --> 00:45:59.860
And you don't know, and
you never get the answer

00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:01.330
from Tolstoy.

00:46:01.330 --> 00:46:05.130
And you know I have always
been fascinated that how,

00:46:05.130 --> 00:46:07.140
you know people can
engage in one act.

00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:10.070
People can go to war for,
for completely different,

00:46:10.070 --> 00:46:11.800
you know for reasons they
don't even know themselves.

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:13.290
And they can be an
act, a redemptive act.

00:46:13.290 --> 00:46:14.900
Or it can be a destructive act.

00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:16.280
So that's something
that you know that,

00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:18.530
that I was hoping to examine.

00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:22.070
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Well,
you, you as, as,

00:46:22.070 --> 00:46:24.110
as Denis did in,
in Tree of Smoke.

00:46:24.110 --> 00:46:28.130
That, that sense of
you know the, the,

00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:35.670
the complete suspension in a
kind of wildcard situation.

00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:39.120
&gt;&gt; Elliot Ackerman: Well like in
Angels, you know, which is one

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:40.430
of my favorite books of his.

00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:44.280
You know you have this
sort of like kind of.

00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:46.210
It's not banal, but it
seems like everyday.

00:46:46.210 --> 00:46:47.510
It opens on a bus.

00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:48.810
I mean, you know, there's a guy,

00:46:48.810 --> 00:46:50.110
you know who's meeting
a woman on a bus.

00:46:50.110 --> 00:46:51.410
She's got her kid.

00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:52.710
You know and by the, you get to
the end of it and you're going,

00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:54.010
you're in the middle
of a bank robbery.

00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:59.210
And the way he could just sort
of slip you from the banal

00:46:59.210 --> 00:47:00.760
into the very, very violent.

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:02.160
And put you in situations
you kind

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:03.990
of can't imagine that you're in.

00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:05.850
You know I think was the
wonderful thing he did

00:47:05.850 --> 00:47:07.150
in his work.

00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:08.450
And I aspire to do
it in my work.

00:47:08.450 --> 00:47:09.750
Particularly when you're
dealing with violence.

00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:11.050
Because the thing
we often forget

00:47:11.050 --> 00:47:13.170
about violence is it
is, it is so banal.

00:47:13.170 --> 00:47:15.300
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Right.

00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:18.880
The dealing with violence, it
seems to me you know, the, the,

00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:23.530
the, the, it's so physical.

00:47:23.530 --> 00:47:26.930
It's so concrete and it's,
it's, it's all around you.

00:47:26.930 --> 00:47:30.230
And yet and you deal with
these war situations.

00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:33.410
But you also said at
one point, Elliot, you,

00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:36.800
you quote actually
quote Faulkner.

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:38.770
In which you say
the only, he said,

00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:42.300
"The only thing worth writing
about is the human heart

00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:44.540
in conflict with itself."

00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:46.110
That being the conflict.

00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:49.100
Not being the conflict
that's around you concretely.

00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:52.440
And, and possibly
threatening your life.

00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:56.140
It seems what interests you
more is the internal conflict

00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:57.440
that is going on.

00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:59.280
Even as that conflict
is happening.

00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:00.720
&gt;&gt; Elliot Ackerman: Well,
I think it's a [inaudible]

00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:02.340
that interests most people.

00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:04.290
I mean, characters
are interesting.

00:48:04.290 --> 00:48:05.890
It's, you know, it's
once you start getting

00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:07.190
into you know you
were talking before

00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:08.490
about you know what
does fiction do?

00:48:08.490 --> 00:48:09.790
You know, fiction takes you

00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:11.090
into the internal
lives of these people.

00:48:11.090 --> 00:48:13.080
And I think that's, that's
where you know that's

00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:14.480
where the most compelling
stories arise.

00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:17.900
You know and that's where
the, the emotion exists.

00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:21.580
And you know why write fiction
I think you know if you are able

00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:23.640
to make someone feel something.

00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:25.250
You know there'll
remember what they felt.

00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:27.300
In a way they might not
remember what they read

00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:31.000
in the paper that morning.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.500
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: One
last question for you.

00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:34.980
And that is, you're a warrior.

00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:38.510
&gt;&gt; Elliot Ackerman:
On my good days.

00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:41.180
[ Laughter ]

00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:47.260
Marie Arana: You know, warriors
come home and things happen.

00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:53.060
And do, do we and I'm, I'm
trying to take this out to,

00:48:53.060 --> 00:49:03.660
to a, a more social or
political question, if you will.

00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:08.480
Why do we revere warriors?

00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:10.870
I mean, we revere
warriors from afar.

00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:13.990
When they come home, when they
are riddled with problems.

00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:19.200
When you know they may be
addicted to drugs or, or,

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:21.890
or beating their
wives or you know,

00:49:21.890 --> 00:49:23.870
a female beating her husbands.

00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:26.000
Or not being good
to the children.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.290
How, why is it that
we're not so good

00:49:29.290 --> 00:49:32.800
at confronting those
issues that they bring home?

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:34.100
&gt;&gt; Elliot Ackerman: Well,

00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:37.700
I think in some respects it's
easy you know at that point

00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:40.000
to look at them as the other.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.060
You know I've often,
probably most people

00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:45.830
who have my background
have, have the experience

00:49:45.830 --> 00:49:47.130
of you know someone
saying to them.

00:49:47.130 --> 00:49:49.800
Like you know I could never
imagine what you went through.

00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:51.350
I'm like, yeah you can.

00:49:51.350 --> 00:49:52.650
Sure you can.

00:49:52.650 --> 00:49:53.950
Like you know, you
can, maybe you've

00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:55.340
like passed by a car accident.

00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:57.540
Or you know you've lost
someone in your own family.

00:49:57.540 --> 00:49:58.850
But I think at the same time

00:49:58.850 --> 00:50:01.300
like saying I can never
imagine what you went through.

00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:03.220
Like always is unsettled to me.

00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:05.420
Not only because it kind
of shows, like you know,

00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:07.540
because it, because
it's, puts up some

00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:10.470
like lack of you know empathy.

00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:12.840
It's like if you can never
imagine what I went through,

00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:14.500
or what someone went
through in this.

00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:16.800
Then what you're basically
saying is that like I have been

00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:20.220
so inalterably changed or one
has been so inalterably changed

00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:24.960
by an experience that you can
no longer identify with them.

00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:26.340
So if you can't understand
what I went through.

00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:27.940
It means I have been
so unalterably changed

00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:29.240
that I can never go back

00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:31.350
to being the person
I was before I left.

00:50:31.350 --> 00:50:34.270
If I can never go back to being
the person I was before I left,

00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:38.290
it in effect means I
can never come home.

00:50:38.290 --> 00:50:40.900
And that's, you know,
and that's, that's,

00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:43.120
that's somewhere we,
we just can't be.

00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:46.880
So, so I think that you know
that, that maybe the answer

00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:50.320
to your question is you know
just a general lack of empathy.

00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:51.620
And lack of being able

00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:53.700
to you know see ourselves
collectively you know

00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:55.780
in these wars.

00:50:55.780 --> 00:50:57.080
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Right, right.

00:50:57.080 --> 00:51:02.860
And with that, I want to
bring on Sam Quinones,

00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:06.510
who deals with issues of-- .

00:51:06.510 --> 00:51:13.170
[ Applause ]

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:15.140
And, and here's what I
want to read about Sam.

00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:18.460
This was written by, by
Laura Miller at Slate.

00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:21.410
"Many nonfiction books are
padded magazine features.

00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:23.730
But Dreamland, the
three-pronged story

00:51:23.730 --> 00:51:26.880
of how heroin addiction
become, became epidemic

00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:28.540
in small town America.

00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:30.620
Is the book Quinones
has to quit his job

00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:32.390
at the L.A. Times to write.

00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:34.840
You won't find this story
better told anywhere else.

00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:37.700
From the economic hollowing-out
of the middle class.

00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:39.380
To the greedy, reckless
marketing

00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:40.860
of pharmaceutical opiates

00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:43.760
to the remarkable
entrepreneurial industry

00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:47.830
of the residents of the obscure
Mexican state of Nayarit.

00:51:47.830 --> 00:51:49.670
All of these factors combine

00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:52.100
to create an opiate-addicted
population

00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:55.380
in small American cities
like Portsmouth, Ohio.

00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:58.130
Where residents, priced
out of pill mills,

00:51:58.130 --> 00:52:01.670
turn to a new and
newly cheap high.

00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:04.210
Dreamland, true crime, sociology

00:52:04.210 --> 00:52:07.420
and expose illuminates a
catastrophe unfolding all

00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:10.430
around us, right now."

00:52:10.430 --> 00:52:12.880
Sam, you've covered the border.

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:15.030
You've covered US-Mexico
relations.

00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:17.820
You've been a Latin
American correspondent for,

00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:19.120
for many, many years.

00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:26.500
At what point did the opioid
crisis get your attention?

00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:31.130
&gt;&gt; Sam Quinones: Well I, I
began a story about when I was

00:52:31.130 --> 00:52:35.890
at the L.A. Times about
a small town in Mexico.

00:52:35.890 --> 00:52:38.740
Where everybody comes
to the United States

00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:41.670
to sell heroin like pizza.

00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:44.580
So there's a delivery system
where you call a number

00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:47.790
and then you have the
operator takes your order

00:52:47.790 --> 00:52:49.200
and then dispatches someone.

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:51.460
To, to meet you when-- it's a,

00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:54.310
it's basically Domino's
Pizza of heroin.

00:52:54.310 --> 00:52:59.430
I came upon it when I was
talking a guy with the DEA

00:52:59.430 --> 00:53:04.040
in Columbus who said, "You know,
we've got this system here.

00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:05.340
We've got these guys doing this.

00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:06.910
We've never seen this before.

00:53:06.910 --> 00:53:10.590
No guns, they don't use guns.

00:53:10.590 --> 00:53:12.560
They're, they're, they're
and we can arrest them

00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:13.860
and arrest them and arrest them.

00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:15.160
And they send out more people.

00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:17.560
They reconstitute like
a, like a some kind

00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:20.640
of a mutant, very quickly."

00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:25.480
And he said, "They're
all from the same town."

00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:29.580
And that, I had written, I had
lived in Mexico for ten years.

00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:30.950
And I had written a lot

00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:33.760
about you see this
a lot across Mexico.

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:35.830
Where towns have,
whereas one town,

00:53:35.830 --> 00:53:38.160
towns where people do one job.

00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:42.190
And, and there's one town in
my first book where everybody

00:53:42.190 --> 00:53:45.150
in the town makes popsicles.

00:53:45.150 --> 00:53:49.090
One of the great businesses,
businesses for arriving

00:53:49.090 --> 00:53:52.150
at the middle class in Mexico
is the popsicle business.

00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:53.450
And there's a business,

00:53:53.450 --> 00:53:55.560
if you know Mexico,
you know, Paleteria.

00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:57.080
That means [inaudible]
is everywhere.

00:53:57.080 --> 00:54:00.060
And that's one town
started that.

00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:04.240
And, and you go to the town,
and there's a, in the front

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:08.530
of the town, there's a two-story
concrete popsicle statue.

00:54:08.530 --> 00:54:10.900
Saying thank you to the
popsicle for bringing them

00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:12.200
into the middle class.

00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:14.560
So when you told me that,
I knew he was right.

00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:15.920
I knew there had to
be a town out there.

00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:17.220
He didn't know which one.

00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:19.470
He said it was Tepic, Nayarit.

00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:20.770
I knew it was not Tepic.

00:54:20.770 --> 00:54:24.800
Tepic is a capital city, 350,000
people of the state of Nayarit.

00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:26.100
I knew that could not be true.

00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:27.400
It had to be a small town.

00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:30.330
So I began to write to
guys who had been arrested

00:54:30.330 --> 00:54:32.140
and were now in federal prison.

00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:35.720
And one after another, I wrote
20, 30 letters to these guys.

00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:39.430
Hey, do you want to talk about
your pizza heroin system?

00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:41.420
You know, basically
is what I did.

00:54:41.420 --> 00:54:44.100
And one guy, one guy
kind of got back to me.

00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:45.400
Says, yeah.

00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:47.990
We're not from Tepic, we're from
little town called [inaudible].

00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:49.700
All are heroin traffickers.

00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:57.060
And I thought at the time it
was just Columbus because that's

00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:58.630
where I first encountered those.

00:54:58.630 --> 00:55:01.710
Then he began to
say, "Oh, no, no.

00:55:01.710 --> 00:55:03.010
We're all over the country."

00:55:03.010 --> 00:55:06.760
And I could not explain a
few things by, about that.

00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:09.520
First of all, they, they
sell black tar heroin.

00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:10.860
And my understanding,
my knowledge

00:55:10.860 --> 00:55:13.710
of black tar heroin was fairly
extensive at that point.

00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:16.130
And black tar heroin is
really for many years only

00:55:16.130 --> 00:55:18.250
on the western side
of the United States.

00:55:18.250 --> 00:55:20.150
What, and now they were
selling in Columbus and really

00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:23.770
in West Virginia and places in
Tennessee, places like that.

00:55:23.770 --> 00:55:25.650
And he began to say,
tell all the cities

00:55:25.650 --> 00:55:28.530
where they were located now,
and they had moved to Charlotte,

00:55:28.530 --> 00:55:32.000
and they had moved to Lexington
and Cincinnati and Memphis

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.080
and Nashville and Indianapolis,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:35.380
All these different towns

00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:38.610
on the eastern side of,
of the United States.

00:55:38.610 --> 00:55:41.380
And could not explain
why it would be

00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:44.960
that heroin traffickers
would have such big business.

00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:46.560
Such a new market.

00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:47.910
I thought heroin
was this old thing

00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:49.370
that no one really
messed with anymore.

00:55:49.370 --> 00:55:51.140
Everyone knew it was a disaster.

00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:53.930
So why would you actually
mess around with, with heroin?

00:55:53.930 --> 00:55:56.430
Why would there be
new, huge new numbers

00:55:56.430 --> 00:55:57.980
of people buying this drug?

00:55:57.980 --> 00:56:00.320
And, and using, and
using this drug?

00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:02.920
And, and that's really what
got me onto the larger story

00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:06.000
which is the pain pills and the
opioids as we know them today.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:10.960
But it was really an
attempt to understand why,

00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:13.220
why Mexican heroin
traffickers, particularly

00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:15.450
from this one town where I went.

00:56:15.450 --> 00:56:19.660
I interviewed eventually a dozen
or so, maybe ten or 12 guys

00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:22.420
who were traffickers, who
were all in federal prison.

00:56:22.420 --> 00:56:24.620
From this town.

00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:25.920
And it was a wave.

00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:30.140
But I understood them to
be the vanguard of this.

00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:35.110
That they were, they were,
the, the spear really under,

00:56:35.110 --> 00:56:38.060
finding the market that
was then going to explode.

00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:39.500
Which has now happened.

00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:41.190
But they were, they
found this market.

00:56:41.190 --> 00:56:45.320
They knew what was going to
happen back in 1998, '99, 2000,

00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:48.750
what's happening today, all
across the country basically.

00:56:48.750 --> 00:56:50.380
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Could you tell
us a little bit about the scale?

00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:52.860
You testified in
Congress not long ago

00:56:52.860 --> 00:56:54.570
and I watched the whole hearing.

00:56:54.570 --> 00:56:56.060
It was absolutely fascinating.

00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:58.760
And, and I recommend it.

00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:01.330
Opioids kill people every day.

00:57:01.330 --> 00:57:06.230
In a scale, I think
you said in the hearing

00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:08.870
that more people are
killed by opiates

00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:11.060
than by car accidents
in this country.

00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:13.280
Tell us about the scale
that we're talking about.

00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:14.580
The scale.

00:57:14.580 --> 00:57:15.880
&gt;&gt; Sam Quinones: The scale?

00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:18.790
Is, is quite stunning, I think.

00:57:18.790 --> 00:57:20.540
Yes, I mean, it,
it must have been.

00:57:20.540 --> 00:57:23.120
One of the great moments or
the fascinating moments, I,

00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:29.090
I describe in my book is
when two public health folks

00:57:29.090 --> 00:57:31.410
from the state of Ohio.

00:57:31.410 --> 00:57:36.720
Realize that there is about
to be a historic shift.

00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:38.610
Since in modern America,

00:57:38.610 --> 00:57:40.940
the automobile has always
been the leading cause

00:57:40.940 --> 00:57:42.290
of accidental death.

00:57:42.290 --> 00:57:43.700
There has never been a time,

00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:46.020
and now of course
that's gotten better.

00:57:46.020 --> 00:57:48.940
You know, we've gotten
more, we've gotten safer.

00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:50.450
You know better cars, et cetera.

00:57:50.450 --> 00:57:52.840
So that number was coming down.

00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:55.010
But in [inaudible] public
health people at the state

00:57:55.010 --> 00:57:58.320
of Ohio figured out that
that was going to end.

00:57:58.320 --> 00:58:03.850
That there was now in the state
of Ohio first the narcot--

00:58:03.850 --> 00:58:06.900
overdoses mostly to
narcotics, pain pills.

00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:10.710
But to some degree
heroin at that point.

00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:12.820
Was overtaking and was going

00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:14.120
to be the number-one
cause of death.

00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:17.050
And that was true
in Ohio in 2007,

00:58:17.050 --> 00:58:20.070
and then it was true
nationally the next year.

00:58:20.070 --> 00:58:23.120
And, and it's a, it's a,
it's a stunning thing.

00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:28.680
I think it's also very
much an undercount.

00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:34.110
Because this story begins and
is most intensely felt in states

00:58:34.110 --> 00:58:36.040
with too many counties.

00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:39.330
And too many counties like
Kentucky has 120 counties

00:58:39.330 --> 00:58:40.630
for four million people.

00:58:40.630 --> 00:58:43.850
Ohio, Ohio has 88 counties
for 11 million people.

00:58:43.850 --> 00:58:46.550
West Virginia has
55 counties for less

00:58:46.550 --> 00:58:47.850
than two million people.

00:58:47.850 --> 00:58:49.880
And the reason that's important
is because this is not like,

00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:51.390
I was a crime reporter.

00:58:51.390 --> 00:58:54.390
Started my career
in the crack days.

00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:56.400
And crack was very public.

00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:57.750
Everything about it was public.

00:58:57.750 --> 00:58:59.050
You couldn't avoid it.

00:58:59.050 --> 00:59:00.350
It was on the streets.

00:59:00.350 --> 00:59:02.520
Drive-by shootings, the gangs
were growing very wealthy and,

00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:04.570
and violent and armed.

00:59:04.570 --> 00:59:06.720
And, and you know
homicide rates went up

00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:08.020
and the violence was horrible.

00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:09.520
And it destroyed neighborhoods.

00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:11.110
And none of that was
happening with this.

00:59:11.110 --> 00:59:13.310
In fact, crime rates
were dropping as,

00:59:13.310 --> 00:59:18.430
as overdose rates were also,
were, were, were, were rising.

00:59:18.430 --> 00:59:22.090
And so you have this, this
kind of transformation of, of,

00:59:22.090 --> 00:59:24.170
of what you normally think of.

00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:26.020
As very quiet, right?

00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:29.120
The doctors were the,
were the source of supply.

00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:31.690
This really starts with
narcotic painkillers.

00:59:31.690 --> 00:59:32.990
Not heroin.

00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:34.290
The traffickers come later.

00:59:34.290 --> 00:59:36.230
So it's really a, so the
suppliers are doctors,

00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:37.530
pharmaceutical companies.

00:59:37.530 --> 00:59:40.650
American patients to
be fixed in a sense.

00:59:40.650 --> 00:59:44.060
And so and, and, and at the
same time you have parents

00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:45.940
and families wanting
to hide the fact

00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:47.240
that their kids are addicted.

00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:49.290
Nobody wants to be recognizing

00:59:49.290 --> 00:59:52.510
that the obituaries are almost
all fabrications and so on.

00:59:52.510 --> 00:59:54.620
So the only place you're
going to find this.

00:59:54.620 --> 00:59:55.920
The place where we're going

00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:59.160
to recognize this is the
coroner's office, bodies.

00:59:59.160 --> 01:00:02.770
But the problem is in these
small counties, in these states

01:00:02.770 --> 01:00:04.840
with too few, too many counties.

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:09.530
The counties, we fund coroner's
offices erroneously, mistakenly,

01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:12.170
I believe, based on
country tax base.

01:00:12.170 --> 01:00:15.370
And so these coroner's
offices are small.

01:00:15.370 --> 01:00:17.230
They're underfunded frequently.

01:00:17.230 --> 01:00:19.970
They don't have enough
doctors in these areas.

01:00:19.970 --> 01:00:21.980
And they have they're, they're,

01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:24.710
they're susceptible
to family influence.

01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:28.170
So you know doc, don't
tell, don't put that in the,

01:00:28.170 --> 01:00:31.420
in the death report
because it's going

01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:33.080
to look bad for, for my dad.

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:36.940
Or my brother or my, my,
my child or what have you.

01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:41.580
And so what's happening today
is really I believe like a,

01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:45.310
an enormous plague
across the country.

01:00:45.310 --> 01:00:47.250
Certainly in large
parts of the country.

01:00:47.250 --> 01:00:49.310
It's very, very intensely felt.

01:00:49.310 --> 01:00:53.180
That is, that is
consuming families.

01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:54.480
Consuming neighborhoods.

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:56.490
Consuming football teams.

01:00:56.490 --> 01:00:59.180
Football is really
basically now a, a,

01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:03.450
a gateway to heroin addiction
in America, in my opinion.

01:01:03.450 --> 01:01:06.720
It, it's, it's, and it's also
destroying those areas that,

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:10.400
in order for those areas to be
great again, lot of these areas.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.890
They have to defeat
this problem.

01:01:12.890 --> 01:01:16.040
Because now, nobody is actually
going to go put a factory

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:18.840
in some areas where half
the population can't pass a

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:20.140
drug test.

01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:22.650
You know, and so it's,
the effect is, is massive.

01:01:22.650 --> 01:01:27.260
And it's, and it's, but on, but
also for a long time, it really.

01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:28.820
[Inaudible] when my
book came out, the,

01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:32.450
the health policy advisor for
Hillary Clinton called me.

01:01:32.450 --> 01:01:35.340
And said, "Hillary is stunned."

01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:37.280
This is 2015.

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:39.740
"She's in Ohio-- she's in Iowa
and she's in New Hampshire,

01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:41.480
and she's stunned
by the ferocity

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:43.810
with which she's seeing
parents come to her and say.

01:01:43.810 --> 01:01:45.240
'We need a solution.'"
They didn't care

01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:47.230
about almost anything else.

01:01:47.230 --> 01:01:50.570
Right? And I said
yes because first

01:01:50.570 --> 01:01:54.030
of all this is a this is
a topic that polls poorly.

01:01:54.030 --> 01:01:55.800
You're never going to get
somebody to admit on the phone

01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:58.580
that this is their most
important subject, right?

01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:00.300
They want to hide it.

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:03.160
But go out there.

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:04.460
Hug people.

01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:06.000
Be a mother to people.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.300
They need that.

01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:11.030
And you know, they're probably
a lot of reasons she lost.

01:02:11.030 --> 01:02:16.300
But, but she, to that she
wrote a policy position paper.

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:17.600
And that was, you know.

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:22.690
So my feeling is this is
a very hidden, even today.

01:02:22.690 --> 01:02:24.810
Even though the awareness
is much greater

01:02:24.810 --> 01:02:26.630
than it ever has been.

01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:29.430
Even today it's still,
we're seeing the,

01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:30.730
these, these icebergs.

01:02:30.730 --> 01:02:33.140
And really down below
is a massive,

01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:35.990
massive issue that's
everywhere in our country.

01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:37.720
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Veterans
in pain?

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:42.500
Or people in, that
recreational as well?

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:45.020
I mean, it, it seems to do
the gamut, the spectrum.

01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:46.540
&gt;&gt; Sam Quinones: Right,
but it's also, yes, sure.

01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:50.340
But it's all, all
connected to this idea

01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:54.750
that took hold in the mid-1990s.

01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:56.900
That promoted by
pain specialists.

01:02:56.900 --> 01:02:58.540
And by pharmaceutical companies.

01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:03.440
And really eagerly accepted by
us, American health consumers.

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:05.570
That narcotic pain
killers were now known

01:03:05.570 --> 01:03:08.440
to be virtually nonaddictive
when used to treat pain.

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:11.300
And therefore, the
corollary, the damaging coro--

01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:12.730
the dangerous corollary to all

01:03:12.730 --> 01:03:14.290
that was it doesn't
matter how many

01:03:14.290 --> 01:03:15.940
of these pills you
get prescribed.

01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:17.610
And you, you probably have gone,

01:03:17.610 --> 01:03:19.940
many of you I'm sure have
gone in for a surgery.

01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:21.960
The pain for which is
going to last what?

01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:23.260
Two to three days?

01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:24.560
You get 30 days'
worth of pills, right?

01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:27.410
Well, you multiply
that by millions

01:03:27.410 --> 01:03:30.410
of Americans every
year for 20 years.

01:03:30.410 --> 01:03:33.850
And what you get is a massive
supply that has created a,

01:03:33.850 --> 01:03:36.360
therefore, a massive
black market.

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:39.990
And so you get kids going
to parties and saying,

01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:42.270
the quarterback is, on the
high school football team is

01:03:42.270 --> 01:03:43.570
taking them.

01:03:43.570 --> 01:03:44.870
So well damn, I'll take them.

01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:46.810
I mean, most of the
addiction is,

01:03:46.810 --> 01:03:49.150
is related in my
opinion to supply.

01:03:49.150 --> 01:03:51.070
Used to believe that, that,

01:03:51.070 --> 01:03:53.630
that our addiction
problems were due to demand.

01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:56.240
And when you're in Mexico,
it's nice to believe that.

01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:57.540
Mexicans want to believe.

01:03:57.540 --> 01:03:58.840
It helps them kind
of wash their hands

01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:00.930
of our bi-national drug problem.

01:04:00.930 --> 01:04:02.230
Well, it's those
gringos up there.

01:04:02.230 --> 01:04:03.770
They just want their dope.

01:04:03.770 --> 01:04:05.070
Well the truth is not that.

01:04:05.070 --> 01:04:07.160
I was, I was convinced of that
when I was living in Mexico.

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:08.460
Now I'm, I'm not.

01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:12.220
I, I, I convinced, I'm convinced
now that it's the supply issue.

01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:14.090
And most drug problems are.

01:04:14.090 --> 01:04:17.310
You unleash a, a vast,
people come to me and say,

01:04:17.310 --> 01:04:18.820
"Should we legalize drugs?"

01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:20.120
[Inaudible] in this book?

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:21.420
And I'm like well what

01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:23.220
about this story makes
you believe we ought

01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:25.040
to legalize drugs?

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:27.340
All of this is due
to legal drugs.

01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:32.660
You unleash a vast, vast
hyper, very potent supply

01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:36.160
of legal drugs on
a, on a population.

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:41.390
And, and you will get
massive problems, you know.

01:04:41.390 --> 01:04:44.480
And it was, it was a time
of, of fantasy, you know?

01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:47.990
I often point out these were
years too when we believed that,

01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:51.230
that many we, we believed
kind of we were special.

01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:53.700
And therefore old rules
don't apply to us.

01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:56.850
You know? And so these
were years you know when,

01:04:56.850 --> 01:04:58.430
when we believed
it was very common

01:04:58.430 --> 01:05:01.250
for numerous baseball players
to hit more than 60 home runs.

01:05:01.250 --> 01:05:03.840
And it happened twice, you know?

01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:05.280
And it has not happened since.

01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:07.560
They cracked down
on steroids, right?

01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:09.830
We believe that if
you package all these,

01:05:09.830 --> 01:05:16.200
all these non-performing nasty
home loans into one security

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:18.160
and Standard &amp; Poor
stamps that thing triple A,

01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:21.390
that's a magnificent place
to, to put your money.

01:05:21.390 --> 01:05:25.720
And we believed that you
massively prescribe narcotics

01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:28.420
derived from the opium poppy.

01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:33.070
That that would not
create some, you know,

01:05:33.070 --> 01:05:37.110
enormous new population
of drug addiction.

01:05:37.110 --> 01:05:41.660
And very much unlike the
subjects of Denis Johnson.

01:05:41.660 --> 01:05:43.550
These are, these are
mainstream people.

01:05:43.550 --> 01:05:47.150
I had a drug addict tell
me, "Dude, I stopped using.

01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:49.560
It was enough to get me
to stop using to watch

01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:52.140
when the football players and
the cheerleaders got addicted."

01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:53.480
Because he was a punk rocker.

01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:55.970
He didn't want to be, he
went to heroin because it was

01:05:55.970 --> 01:05:58.220
like this outside kind of thing.

01:05:58.220 --> 01:05:59.850
Rebel kind of thing.

01:05:59.850 --> 01:06:02.560
Now it's very much mainstream.

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:04.950
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: This is what
I was trying to point out.

01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:09.660
In, in one of the short stories
in Largesse of the Sea Maiden,

01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:12.580
which was just published
posthumously,

01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:16.320
by, by Random House.

01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:19.630
Wonderful book, absolutely
marvelous book of short stories.

01:06:19.630 --> 01:06:22.810
In many ways, I think
a culmination of,

01:06:22.810 --> 01:06:24.750
of Denis' talent.

01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:28.440
He writes about a jail
bird's ability to get high

01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:31.160
on the most unexpected
of substances.

01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:33.760
That at one point,
somebody brings

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:35.750
in a newspaper soaked in LSD.

01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:37.940
And everybody just thinks well
that's just a newspaper except

01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:39.720
that it's, you know,
it's satisfying.

01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:42.120
This is a very different
thing that you're describing.

01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:46.110
This is not, this is,
it's, it's jump-- .

01:06:46.110 --> 01:06:49.710
&gt;&gt; Sam Quinones: This is
almost entirely white people.

01:06:49.710 --> 01:06:52.010
This is, it starts in
Appalachia and the Rust Belt.

01:06:52.010 --> 01:06:56.070
Which of course that is
where, where, we're very eager

01:06:56.070 --> 01:06:58.420
to ignore and did ignore.

01:06:58.420 --> 01:07:02.370
But by the time I
got onto the story,

01:07:02.370 --> 01:07:04.730
really it had spread
far, far beyond.

01:07:04.730 --> 01:07:06.550
And really had spread
across America.

01:07:06.550 --> 01:07:11.110
And had spread really,
stunningly, in my opinion

01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:14.160
to some of the, the
very nicest suburbs.

01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:17.350
Orange County is like our heroin
beltway in L.A. now, you know.

01:07:17.350 --> 01:07:21.110
Some of the nicest suburbs
where people had done best

01:07:21.110 --> 01:07:24.940
in the economic expansions of
the previous say 20 or 30 years.

01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:27.530
It was in those areas, I've
always thought it was stunning.

01:07:27.530 --> 01:07:31.690
That in those areas, people are,
were getting addicted and dying

01:07:31.690 --> 01:07:34.810
from drugs used to numb pain.

01:07:34.810 --> 01:07:36.480
Like you look at their
lives, and you go,

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:39.460
well what pain exactly
do you feel?

01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:42.910
They have the perfect life
in the history of the world,

01:07:42.910 --> 01:07:47.400
.0001% have lived,
of the people ever

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:49.410
to exist have lived
as well as you.

01:07:49.410 --> 01:07:53.770
And you've got to, you know,
use these, use these drugs to?"

01:07:53.770 --> 01:07:56.990
But, but I mean, I, I think
that that's kind of the story

01:07:56.990 --> 01:08:00.530
that I, I initially believed.

01:08:00.530 --> 01:08:03.450
That I was writing the great
American drug trafficking story.

01:08:03.450 --> 01:08:05.030
I want to be, I was
a crime reporter.

01:08:05.030 --> 01:08:07.030
That's really all I
wanted to do, you know?

01:08:07.030 --> 01:08:09.500
I wanted to write about
Mexico and all the crime

01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:12.230
and gangs and all this stuff.

01:08:12.230 --> 01:08:14.910
And then I began to
realize no, that, well yes.

01:08:14.910 --> 01:08:16.210
This is certainly that story.

01:08:16.210 --> 01:08:18.990
But there's a whole
lot more to it.

01:08:18.990 --> 01:08:20.870
There's, there's,
there's, there's isolat--

01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:23.360
really what it comes
down to is not economics.

01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:26.020
How do you say a Rust
Belt town in Charlotte,

01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:28.830
North Carolina had
the same problem.

01:08:28.830 --> 01:08:30.260
And make it an economics-- ?

01:08:30.260 --> 01:08:31.560
It's not an economics.

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:34.810
Or when it really has
to do with, I believe,

01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:37.330
my common denominator
with the best I can come

01:08:37.330 --> 01:08:40.920
up with is our own deep
and profound isolation.

01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:43.100
And our destruction
of community.

01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:49.320
Which is why I chose the,
this pool, swimming pool

01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:50.770
in a small town called
Portsmouth,

01:08:50.770 --> 01:08:53.970
Ohio, on the Ohio River.

01:08:53.970 --> 01:08:58.080
For the metaphor really,
the, the central issue,

01:08:58.080 --> 01:08:59.620
image of the, of the book.

01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:01.610
It, the name of the
pool was Dreamland,

01:09:01.610 --> 01:09:04.090
and the pool was a place
where everyone came together

01:09:04.090 --> 01:09:05.390
and got, and, and grew up.

01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:08.410
And was a steel mill
and shoe factories

01:09:08.410 --> 01:09:10.290
and bustling Main
Street and all that.

01:09:10.290 --> 01:09:12.450
And 50,000 people,
and the pool was

01:09:12.450 --> 01:09:14.920
where they all came together
and formed community.

01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:17.520
And then of course
the steel mill leaves.

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:19.830
The, the, the shoe
factories leave.

01:09:19.830 --> 01:09:22.210
The, the, the Main
Street just empties out.

01:09:22.210 --> 01:09:23.510
Classic fashion.

01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:24.810
Half the town leaves.

01:09:24.810 --> 01:09:26.940
And then everyone
retreats indoors.

01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:30.060
And finally they can't
sustain it, and they dig up

01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:32.110
and destroy Dreamland.

01:09:32.110 --> 01:09:34.860
And replace it with
a, with a strip mall

01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:38.410
and an O'Reilly's Auto
Parts store as the, as the,

01:09:38.410 --> 01:09:39.710
the, the anchor tenant.

01:09:39.710 --> 01:09:42.730
And, and then they
become exposed.

01:09:42.730 --> 01:09:45.240
Not unlike I believe the,

01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:48.250
the Indians when the
Europeans brought smallpox.

01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:49.800
You know it, it just became.

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:53.300
They had no bulwark, community
bulwark to keep this at bay.

01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:57.810
And I think that that, that is
what we're, what we're dealing

01:09:57.810 --> 01:09:59.110
with now in a deeper sense.

01:09:59.110 --> 01:10:03.110
Kind of with this, with this
opioid epidemic that is,

01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:05.700
you know, coast to coast.

01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:07.690
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: This is what
struck me about your hearing.

01:10:07.690 --> 01:10:11.830
And I want to bring Jon
into this because you said

01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:16.370
in the hearing that
it was at that point.

01:10:16.370 --> 01:10:21.920
Where you know families from
all kinds of classes and,

01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:24.510
and would get together
and, and [inaudible].

01:10:24.510 --> 01:10:28.660
This was their, you know, the,
the community coming together.

01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:34.410
And a kind of, of, of real
connect-- connectedness there.

01:10:34.410 --> 01:10:39.080
And so much of what Jon writes
about is a kind of disconnect.

01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:41.940
Where you're reeling out
of connection, really.

01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:47.100
Because you know it either,
your marriage is falling apart.

01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:54.230
Your, your, the economy
has, has, has gone bust.

01:10:54.230 --> 01:11:00.080
And you don't have a job in,
in, in, in the mining town.

01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:01.880
So.

01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:08.200
My, my question is and this
is a Pollyanna question,

01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:10.530
I, I, I admit.

01:11:10.530 --> 01:11:14.890
Fix the malaise,
fix the problem,

01:11:14.890 --> 01:11:16.880
fix this disconnectedness.

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:18.180
Jon, what do you think?

01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:22.060
And, and you start to-- because
I think you actually said

01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:23.450
in the hearing, Sam.

01:11:23.450 --> 01:11:26.580
You said, you've got
to get back to that.

01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:27.930
You've got to get back
to that connection.

01:11:27.930 --> 01:11:31.180
You've got to get back
to that community.

01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:32.840
What do you think, Jon?

01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:36.050
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Franzen: I, I would,
I would respectfully disagree

01:11:36.050 --> 01:11:38.110
that I write about
dysfunctional families.

01:11:38.110 --> 01:11:40.140
I think, I think the
dysfunctional families are

01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:45.440
likely to be found where
there is a substance.

01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:49.170
I, in fact, write about
highly functional families.

01:11:49.170 --> 01:11:50.470
The kids are all
well taken care of.

01:11:50.470 --> 01:11:51.770
They're not dropped
on their head.

01:11:51.770 --> 01:11:55.840
There are in fact no
serious drug addictions.

01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:57.140
And yeah, I'm an old leftist.

01:11:57.140 --> 01:12:01.030
And I actually think that you
know just, we've been ground

01:12:01.030 --> 01:12:06.900
between the twin grinding
plates of consumerism and kind

01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:09.380
of which is an atomizing force.

01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:14.960
It makes the individual consumer
the most important thing.

01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:17.330
And in fact, I would
actually flip it around

01:12:17.330 --> 01:12:19.480
and say the reason I'm writing
about families is I think

01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:22.270
of the family as the one
thing that you can't.

01:12:22.270 --> 01:12:25.610
No matter how hard
the two plates grind,

01:12:25.610 --> 01:12:27.920
you can't actually
dissolve the family bond.

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:29.220
So if you're interested

01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:31.330
in psychological
intensity in a novel.

01:12:31.330 --> 01:12:35.180
Which is kind of catnip
for me, you're naturally,

01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:37.130
you're naturally
drawn to the family.

01:12:37.130 --> 01:12:38.710
Because that's like one of the
few places you can find it.

01:12:38.710 --> 01:12:40.100
You're not going to
find it necessarily

01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:42.230
at the community level or
even at the friendship level.

01:12:42.230 --> 01:12:43.780
Because of this.

01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:47.420
So yeah, I, I, I do think
that this, and then of course.

01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:51.000
Corporate pharmaceutical forces
and then, and you know all

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.370
of those things you
were mentioning.

01:12:52.370 --> 01:12:54.290
And then the financial industry.

01:12:54.290 --> 01:12:56.640
The, the worst of
capitalism is kind of piling

01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:57.940
on to make these things worse.

01:12:57.940 --> 01:12:59.920
&gt;&gt; Sam Quinones: I think
heroin's interesting to me

01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:01.960
because it dawns on
me that that is--

01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:04.200
piggybacking on what
you're saying.

01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:06.750
Is that that is, if you
are a culture that believes

01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:08.910
that stuff will buy
you happiness.

01:13:08.910 --> 01:13:10.450
Well, then the final stuff

01:13:10.450 --> 01:13:15.670
that could potentially buy you
happiness is this cruddy stuff

01:13:15.670 --> 01:13:17.030
that you inject in your vein.

01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:22.000
I mean, it's a final expression
of that philosophy of living.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.800
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Franzen: And you're
on the hedonic treadmill.

01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:25.140
It's like you got to-- .

01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:27.310
&gt;&gt; Sam Quinones: You
never really-- happiness.

01:13:27.310 --> 01:13:28.610
Yeah, no of course.

01:13:28.610 --> 01:13:32.190
It makes you feel like
you've attained it

01:13:32.190 --> 01:13:33.910
for a moment until you don't.

01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:35.210
You haven't attained it anymore.

01:13:35.210 --> 01:13:36.510
You've got to get back.

01:13:36.510 --> 01:13:38.090
And the, what I've found
interesting, frankly,

01:13:38.090 --> 01:13:40.020
was that the same guys,

01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:42.410
the Mexican guys I
was writing about.

01:13:42.410 --> 01:13:43.970
They never use their dope.

01:13:43.970 --> 01:13:46.320
They would use cocaine,
they would drink.

01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:48.040
But they never used their dope.

01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:51.040
But they were also addicted.

01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:56.690
They were addicted to, as, as
poor young men, leaving home,

01:13:56.690 --> 01:13:58.380
being poor in Mexico is not just

01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:00.010
about having not
very much money.

01:14:00.010 --> 01:14:03.580
It's also being humiliated for
not having very much money.

01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:07.430
They would come home with money,
and that was their narcotic.

01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:09.250
They would, they
would accumulate.

01:14:09.250 --> 01:14:10.840
One of the things
that they loved

01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:12.870
to accumulate was
Levi's 501 jeans.

01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:15.110
And because those
were the classic,

01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:19.070
the rural gold standard for, for
men, rural menswear in Mexico

01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:20.370
when I was there for sure.

01:14:20.370 --> 01:14:21.670
Were Levi's 501 jeans.

01:14:21.670 --> 01:14:22.970
They would bring them.

01:14:22.970 --> 01:14:24.270
And, and all the
addicts would bring them,

01:14:24.270 --> 01:14:26.700
them jeans for their dope.

01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:29.120
Trade them dope,
jeans for the dope.

01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:30.790
They'd take the dope,
the jeans home.

01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:33.710
And turn, and, and give
them away like Santa Claus.

01:14:33.710 --> 01:14:36.920
But all the, all these guys
who they'd grown up with.

01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:38.650
All the girls want
to talk to them.

01:14:38.650 --> 01:14:41.940
All these men would come to
them and ask for, for loans.

01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:43.450
Well, you don't get
asked for loans.

01:14:43.450 --> 01:14:44.750
That's a good thing.

01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:46.230
You don't asked for loans
unless you have money.

01:14:46.230 --> 01:14:47.800
To be, to be actually giving.

01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:50.570
And so there's this, there's
this feeling throughout,

01:14:50.570 --> 01:14:53.490
throughout the research that
I had that everybody was kind

01:14:53.490 --> 01:14:57.260
of addicted to, to something.

01:14:57.260 --> 01:14:58.780
But it was not.

01:14:58.780 --> 01:15:00.320
They were looking for happiness.

01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:03.670
And the truth is happiness
doesn't, this is pleasure that--

01:15:03.670 --> 01:15:06.000
happiness doesn't
come from that.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.860
But it's all that consumer
culture that you're referring

01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:11.920
to I think is very, very, a
big part of our [inaudible].

01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:13.680
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Yeah,
it's almost like it,

01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:16.890
it actually is reminding me of,
of something that Denis wrote

01:15:16.890 --> 01:15:20.120
that sort of vulture feeling.

01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:25.800
Certainly that, I, it's
his journalism in Liberia.

01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:29.370
And he, I can't remember
if this was

01:15:29.370 --> 01:15:31.970
for Esquire magazine
or what it was for.

01:15:31.970 --> 01:15:36.900
But he was describing this
tremendously nightmarish war.

01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:44.040
In which the, the dogs are
looking very prosperous

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:47.420
and the people are starving.

01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:50.700
And the reason why the dogs are
looking are so prosperous is

01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:53.290
of course because they're
feeding on the corpses.

01:15:53.290 --> 01:15:56.510
I don't know why, it's
a very, very dark image.

01:15:56.510 --> 01:15:57.810
[Laughter]

01:15:57.810 --> 01:15:59.120
&gt;&gt; Sam Quinones: You
can say that again.

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:03.660
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: But it's a,
I, I, it suggests to me, and,

01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:08.990
and Elliot maybe could,
could comment to this.

01:16:08.990 --> 01:16:12.880
That it's almost
a metaphor that.

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:20.040
In the consumer business
it also,

01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:22.510
you know in the business of war.

01:16:22.510 --> 01:16:27.270
There is there are
corpses all about.

01:16:27.270 --> 01:16:28.570
There are people dying.

01:16:28.570 --> 01:16:31.620
This is a, a, a, crisis
that, I mean, I just,

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:33.800
just in the newspaper today.

01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:36.240
A headline.

01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:38.460
Nearly one million people,

01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:41.660
nearly one million
Americans are not working

01:16:41.660 --> 01:16:44.750
because they're too
sick from opioids.

01:16:44.750 --> 01:16:47.260
Last year it was
70,000 people dead.

01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:49.620
Year before that it
was 64,000 people dead.

01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:51.720
More than Vietnam War.

01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:55.770
There is this sense of
you know the, the, the,

01:16:55.770 --> 01:17:01.890
the industry devouring almost
in a sort of warlike way.

01:17:01.890 --> 01:17:05.240
The, these victims.

01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:09.710
And, and there seems to
be a failure afoot of,

01:17:09.710 --> 01:17:13.210
of responsibility in the sense.

01:17:13.210 --> 01:17:14.510
I mean, what could we have done?

01:17:14.510 --> 01:17:16.140
Where could we stop it?

01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:18.330
What, what can we do now?

01:17:18.330 --> 01:17:20.240
And a little bit of a war scene.

01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:21.780
I would think.

01:17:21.780 --> 01:17:23.080
Elliot.

01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:24.380
&gt;&gt; Sam Quinones: Help
us out here, Elliot.

01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:27.380
&gt;&gt; Elliot Ackerman: Yeah, sorry.

01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:28.680
[Laughter] I think definitely.

01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:33.330
I think what you
I mean, you know,

01:17:33.330 --> 01:17:35.790
wars build their own economies.

01:17:35.790 --> 01:17:37.900
I'm sure you've seen
this in your reporting.

01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:40.150
And I think we have a
conventionally American

01:17:40.150 --> 01:17:43.390
perception of war
as a war begins.

01:17:43.390 --> 01:17:44.690
It's fought for a cause.

01:17:44.690 --> 01:17:46.730
And then it ends, and somebody
wins, and somebody loses.

01:17:46.730 --> 01:17:50.060
Well you know the reason we're
in our 17th year, for instance,

01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:51.410
of fighting in Afghanistan.

01:17:51.410 --> 01:17:54.240
Is not because we haven't
found like that perfect bit

01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:57.700
of alchemy to, you know
defeat the Taliban.

01:17:57.700 --> 01:17:59.620
Or whoever we've
decided our enemy is.

01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:01.020
Is because you start
to get into a cycle

01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:03.740
where the war just
feeds upon itself.

01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:05.910
And why is it feeding
upon itself?

01:18:05.910 --> 01:18:08.390
You know, one part can be you
know the internal dynamics

01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:09.690
in an Afghanistan.

01:18:09.690 --> 01:18:11.150
Or in Iraq and all those reasons

01:18:11.150 --> 01:18:12.840
that we feel are
very, very far away.

01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:16.070
I think if we, you know, if we
turned the light on ourselves.

01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:18.410
It's also because
every war you go to,

01:18:18.410 --> 01:18:20.550
you go to war with a construct.

01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:22.600
You know, whether it was
the national mobilization

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:25.320
that existed in the Second
World War where you know

01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:27.400
where the entire country
got behind the effort.

01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:30.720
To you know the draft in
the Vietnam War, to today.

01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:33.020
Where we are fighting
wars that are resourced

01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:34.810
with an volunteer military.

01:18:34.810 --> 01:18:36.870
And they're funded
through deficit spending.

01:18:36.870 --> 01:18:39.640
So kind of like you
know your painkillers,

01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:41.500
you don't feel a thing.

01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:44.910
And it goes on and
on and on and on.

01:18:44.910 --> 01:18:46.860
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Franzen: Sam, is it?

01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:50.230
Is it your impression
that the, that these are,

01:18:50.230 --> 01:18:52.340
you say it's about supply.

01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:54.660
That seems to imply these
are, these are people

01:18:54.660 --> 01:18:58.660
who if they hadn't happened
to have access to the opioids,

01:18:58.660 --> 01:19:02.900
they would have had good,
successful, satisfying lives?

01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:04.200
&gt;&gt; Sam Quinones:
It's hard to say.

01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:05.500
You're right.

01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:06.800
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Franzen:
Because that, I,

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:09.130
the mention of Afghanistan
puts me at, and there is this,

01:19:09.130 --> 01:19:12.540
and as I said, there's this,
we were talking backstage.

01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:14.800
There is an overlap
between areas of,

01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:18.290
certainly where the opioid
crisis first made itself

01:19:18.290 --> 01:19:19.590
particularly visible.

01:19:19.590 --> 01:19:21.470
And Trump America.

01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:23.640
There is a, there is a
kind of despair and a sort

01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:26.450
of let's just burn
it all down quality.

01:19:26.450 --> 01:19:28.640
And that's absolutely
what happens if you tear

01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:30.820
up a country with
17 years of war.

01:19:30.820 --> 01:19:34.770
I mean, there's like,
why not keep fighting?

01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:37.230
&gt;&gt; But there's also the sense
in what you were talking about,

01:19:37.230 --> 01:19:38.570
too, which was this, you know,

01:19:38.570 --> 01:19:40.780
this fantasia that
we're living in.

01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:44.470
Oh yes, we can have you know
opioid drugs and be fine.

01:19:44.470 --> 01:19:47.210
It's also the sense
of you know, oh yeah,

01:19:47.210 --> 01:19:48.740
we can [inaudible]
our institutions

01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:50.410
and we'll all be
psychologically okay.

01:19:50.410 --> 01:19:53.420
Like oh yeah, we can just
you know resource our wars

01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:54.720
out to other people.

01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:56.020
And not pay taxes
on them, and yeah,

01:19:56.020 --> 01:19:57.320
that's going to work out fine.

01:19:57.320 --> 01:19:58.780
Like it's probably,
it was a good thing

01:19:58.780 --> 01:20:00.490
that we had a draft
in the sixties.

01:20:00.490 --> 01:20:03.220
You know. And then everybody
you know got to a certain point.

01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:05.010
It was like this makes no sense.

01:20:05.010 --> 01:20:06.310
We're not doing it anymore.

01:20:06.310 --> 01:20:08.330
And now, you just
don't [inaudible].

01:20:08.330 --> 01:20:09.630
&gt;&gt; Sam Quinones: Exactly.

01:20:09.630 --> 01:20:11.850
Oh, 100%. I've said
this, in fact, in my,

01:20:11.850 --> 01:20:14.900
in talks that I've been giving
around the country about this.

01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:18.780
That, that it's like we,
yeah, we just have this like.

01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:22.450
The whole, the whole
theme really is to me,

01:20:22.450 --> 01:20:25.650
I thought again it was drug
trafficking and that's not that.

01:20:25.650 --> 01:20:29.830
It's, it's isolation
versus community.

01:20:29.830 --> 01:20:33.220
You know we used to treat
pain in a variety of ways.

01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:35.660
One person would get a
variety of approaches.

01:20:35.660 --> 01:20:37.320
So it would be you have pain?

01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:38.620
Chronic pain?

01:20:38.620 --> 01:20:40.250
Well cognitive behavioral
therapy.

01:20:40.250 --> 01:20:41.550
Diet, swimming.

01:20:41.550 --> 01:20:43.370
Pain? Marital counseling,
you know?

01:20:43.370 --> 01:20:44.670
You need that.

01:20:44.670 --> 01:20:45.980
The, the marriage is pain.

01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:47.710
So [laughter] if you-- .

01:20:47.710 --> 01:20:50.040
Seriously, that's what
they would, that's why part

01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:54.560
of what went into, but then
we, the pills took up all the.

01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:57.270
We began to believe in easy
answers to complicated problems.

01:20:57.270 --> 01:21:00.840
We began to have a-- I told
an audience the other day.

01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:02.920
I can't remember
where it was now.

01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:06.210
That one of the worst things
we ever did was go to war.

01:21:06.210 --> 01:21:08.480
And then give us, give
ourselves a tax cut.

01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:11.540
It's like we didn't really,
there's one infinitesimal part

01:21:11.540 --> 01:21:13.950
of our population was going
ask to be going over there

01:21:13.950 --> 01:21:15.340
and risk their lives
to fight a war.

01:21:15.340 --> 01:21:18.370
And we were not supposed
to feel anything.

01:21:18.370 --> 01:21:20.200
We just all want it
to be narc at times.

01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:22.070
We all want it to
be kind of immune.

01:21:22.070 --> 01:21:24.010
And what's more and very,
very important in all

01:21:24.010 --> 01:21:25.550
of this I believe,
very important.

01:21:25.550 --> 01:21:28.610
Is that we, we were not
asked to be accountable.

01:21:28.610 --> 01:21:30.260
And not, with pain either.

01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:33.290
We were not asked to
say, you know, when you,

01:21:33.290 --> 01:21:34.770
you have chronic pains.

01:21:34.770 --> 01:21:36.070
Very often it has to do

01:21:36.070 --> 01:21:39.740
with your own personal
consumer decisions.

01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:41.070
You don't get enough exercise.

01:21:41.070 --> 01:21:42.370
You eat poorly, you smoke.

01:21:42.370 --> 01:21:43.670
You drink.

01:21:43.670 --> 01:21:44.970
You're on a variety of things.

01:21:44.970 --> 01:21:46.780
Doctors found the patients
didn't want to hear that.

01:21:46.780 --> 01:21:48.610
You know? And so they
just said, "You know,

01:21:48.610 --> 01:21:50.750
doc, I want you to fix me.

01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:52.050
You're the car mechanic.

01:21:52.050 --> 01:21:53.350
My body's a car.

01:21:53.350 --> 01:21:54.650
Fix me, you know?"

01:21:54.650 --> 01:21:56.810
And we got into this
attitude of,

01:21:56.810 --> 01:21:59.820
that I believe was
also very kind of,

01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:01.420
just a narcotized attitude.

01:22:01.420 --> 01:22:03.250
That we don't want
to have to deal

01:22:03.250 --> 01:22:06.100
with our own, our own decisions.

01:22:06.100 --> 01:22:10.290
We don't, or, or, or, or change
our way of, of, of living.

01:22:10.290 --> 01:22:13.300
And part of it is
when we went to war.

01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:17.940
And took, and, and were
happy to get a tax cut.

01:22:17.940 --> 01:22:20.650
I mean, one of the lowest
points in our culture,

01:22:20.650 --> 01:22:21.950
frankly was right there.

01:22:21.950 --> 01:22:25.530
Really it was a very
sad day, I thought.

01:22:27.250 --> 01:22:28.550
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Before we move

01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:30.990
on to the last segment
of this program.

01:22:30.990 --> 01:22:34.040
I want to thank these
extraordinary writers

01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:41.150
who in one way or another speak
to I think Denis Johnson's work.

01:22:41.150 --> 01:22:49.950
His sort of miraculous
ability to take so many themes

01:22:49.950 --> 01:22:51.550
that we've talked about here.

01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:57.180
And merge them into express--
the spectacular literature.

01:22:57.180 --> 01:22:59.210
So thank you to Jonathan
Franzen,

01:22:59.210 --> 01:23:03.650
thank you to Elliot Ackerman,
thank you to Sam Quinones,

01:23:03.650 --> 01:23:07.310
before we move onto the
next part of the program.

01:23:07.310 --> 01:23:08.790
The very tail end.

01:23:08.790 --> 01:23:11.510
Thank you so much.

01:23:11.510 --> 01:23:27.220
[ Applause ]

01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:34.220
And now, to, to tell us about
the personal, more personal side

01:23:34.220 --> 01:23:38.790
of Denis Johnson, I want to
welcome Elizabeth Cuthrell

01:23:38.790 --> 01:23:41.930
to come and talk about
her personal recollections

01:23:41.930 --> 01:23:45.460
and her work in film with Denis.

01:23:45.460 --> 01:23:47.260
Elizabeth, please.

01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:56.040
[ Applause ]

01:23:56.040 --> 01:23:57.340
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth: Good
evening everybody.

01:23:57.340 --> 01:23:59.400
Thank you for being here.

01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:02.400
I think I'm going to
usher in a different tone.

01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:04.050
I hope that's okay.

01:24:04.050 --> 01:24:09.220
I first met Denis in
1997 when my partners

01:24:09.220 --> 01:24:12.810
and I were writing the
screenplay for Jesus' Son.

01:24:12.810 --> 01:24:14.980
We were just starting
out in the film business.

01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:17.190
It was our first project.

01:24:17.190 --> 01:24:20.430
I was a huge fan of Denis' work.

01:24:20.430 --> 01:24:22.830
I had somehow convinced
him in a phone call

01:24:22.830 --> 01:24:25.730
to let us take a
whack at the script.

01:24:25.730 --> 01:24:29.450
I promised him if he hated it,
we wouldn't make the movie.

01:24:29.450 --> 01:24:31.430
And he knew I meant it.

01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:33.040
We sent him the first draft.

01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:37.430
He loved it, and asked to come
to New York City to meet us.

01:24:37.430 --> 01:24:41.800
He ambled into the meting
wearing a vintage Aloha shirt.

01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:46.870
Red cowboy boots, and Elvis
Presley glasses held together

01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:49.020
in the middle by tape.

01:24:49.020 --> 01:24:51.280
I was terrified and thrilled

01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:54.400
to meet this genius whose
book we were adapting.

01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:58.030
He seemed shy and
amused at the same time.

01:24:58.030 --> 01:25:01.190
But what I remember
most was his generosity.

01:25:01.190 --> 01:25:04.660
He marveled at our
adaptation and talked to us

01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:09.540
like we were the geniuses and he
was the kid just starting out.

01:25:09.540 --> 01:25:12.360
I asked him if he'd be willing
to play a part in the film.

01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:15.690
And he said, "Only if I
can play Terrance Weber,

01:25:15.690 --> 01:25:18.220
the guy with the
knife in his eye."

01:25:19.510 --> 01:25:22.100
[Laughter] He added, "That
way, if I hate the movie,

01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:24.530
I can use my performance
as a metaphor."

01:25:24.530 --> 01:25:25.830
[Laughter]

01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:29.600
So a year later, we were
on the film set together.

01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:30.950
Denis was effusive.

01:25:30.950 --> 01:25:33.470
He kept saying, "This is
exactly what it looked like.

01:25:33.470 --> 01:25:36.160
This is exactly what
it felt like."

01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:38.810

01:26:06.980 --> 01:26:09.650
I'd taken the job because
Michelle was pregnant

01:26:09.650 --> 01:26:12.300

to be responsible.

01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:13.740
I had nothing to do on
the overnight shift,

I'd fell asleep

she's blind me.

Thank you.

01:29:27.410 --> 01:29:30.410
Collaborating with
Denis on his stuff was

01:29:30.410 --> 01:29:32.480
like stepping into
another world.

01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:37.050
Something in me would always get
rearranged, open, challenged.

01:29:37.050 --> 01:29:39.880
We worked on a bunch of projects
together over the years.

01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:44.000
And were cooking up some new
ideas right up until the end.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.960
Denis was fierce about
protecting his work.

01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:49.060
If someone tried
to change or cut

01:29:49.060 --> 01:29:52.610
or wrongly interpret his
writing, he would be crushed.

01:29:52.610 --> 01:29:54.890
But he would also do what
he had to do to protect it.

01:29:54.890 --> 01:29:58.280
At a production of one
of his plays in Chicago,

01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:00.560
he arrived for the
final dress rehearsal

01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:01.910
and was stunned to realize.

01:30:01.910 --> 01:30:05.740
The director decided to use
this kind of sound machine

01:30:05.740 --> 01:30:07.040
to weave a creepy,

01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:10.110
weird background sound
into the production.

01:30:10.110 --> 01:30:11.940
Denis hated it.

01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:13.770
He spoke to the director
and producer,

01:30:13.770 --> 01:30:15.770
but they wouldn't budge.

01:30:15.770 --> 01:30:18.190
So as a last desperate measure,

01:30:18.190 --> 01:30:20.440
that night after
everyone had left.

01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:23.430
He snuck back into the theater.

01:30:23.430 --> 01:30:26.120
Stuck the sound machine
under his jacket.

01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:28.510

it into the river.

[ Laughter ]

01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:34.220
Needless to say, he was locked
out of the theater from then on.

01:30:34.220 --> 01:30:38.310
In his writing, Denis
could be merciless.

01:30:38.310 --> 01:30:41.830
But as a friend, he
was profoundly kind.

01:30:41.830 --> 01:30:43.880
He saw into you, but
he didn't judge you.

01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:45.580
And when you made a bad choice,

01:30:45.580 --> 01:30:48.850
he'd help you find
something heroic about it.

01:30:48.850 --> 01:30:52.080
He was awake and aware,
and in my opinion hooked

01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:54.460
up to some sacred line.

01:30:54.460 --> 01:30:56.110
There were no layers on him.

01:30:56.110 --> 01:30:57.490
He felt everything.

Ever infirmity, in detail,
and at the speed of light.

01:31:00.490 --> 01:31:03.100
And that can't be easy.

01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:06.230
But whenever I asked him how
he was, he would always say,

01:31:06.230 --> 01:31:09.510
"I'm getting better
and better every day."

01:31:09.510 --> 01:31:13.080
And in one of our very last
email exchanges, he wrote,

01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:15.520
"I thought late life was
supposed to be boring.

01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:20.660
I'm finding it more like a
trip over Niagara Falls."

01:31:20.660 --> 01:31:23.460

that read like prayers.

That everything is renewed,
replenished perpetually.

And here I pass it on to you."

01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:14.150
Denis' openness and sensitivity
sometimes made it hard for him

01:32:14.150 --> 01:32:15.470
to deal with the rest of us.

01:32:15.470 --> 01:32:18.610
And especially the crazy
business side of art.

01:32:18.610 --> 01:32:20.240
He told me when he
was out in L.A.,

01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:23.600
trying to get work made not long
after Tree of Smoke came out.

01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:27.170

insane Hollywood bullshitters

But proudly introduce him
to each other as Dave.

01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:34.850
[Laughter] And say,
"This is Dave.

01:32:34.850 --> 01:32:36.830
He won the National Book Award."

01:32:36.830 --> 01:32:41.210
These kinds of experiences
encouraged him to treat,

01:32:41.210 --> 01:32:43.530
retreat back to Idaho or Arizona

01:32:43.530 --> 01:32:46.680
and earn his reputation
as being reclusive.

01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:49.690
But there was something about
the process of making plays,

01:32:49.690 --> 01:32:52.830
screenplays and teleplays that
brought out a part of Denis

01:32:52.830 --> 01:32:56.260
that was jazzed and
collaborative and social.

01:32:56.260 --> 01:32:57.800
And he couldn't stay away from.

01:32:57.800 --> 01:33:00.300
And he loved actors.

01:33:00.300 --> 01:33:03.300
He would sometimes go into
ecstatic states listen

01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:05.440
to them make sense of his work.

01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:08.540
Here's part of an email he
wrote after a rehearsal.

01:33:08.540 --> 01:33:10.980
"Elizabeth, what a
privilege to sit in a room

Lastly, I want to
talk just for a moment

about Denis' wife,

01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:40.870

her and their kids.

Their beautiful daughter

01:33:50.610 --> 01:33:54.020
It was truly like he
was channeling sunlight.

Cindy took care of
everything the world demanded

of Denis so he could make art.

01:33:59.650 --> 01:34:01.520
She was his buoy.

Denis could be impulsive
with money.

01:34:03.290 --> 01:34:05.760
And he told me that once
Cindy took over the checkbook,

01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:09.430
the repo man stopped
coming for his car.

01:34:09.430 --> 01:34:11.470
[Laughter] He's always say,
"I don't know how she does it!

01:34:11.470 --> 01:34:13.020
Does she clip coupons?

01:34:13.020 --> 01:34:15.790
Buy everything at a fire sale?"

01:34:15.790 --> 01:34:17.700
She dazzled him.

01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:21.870
He never seemed to get over how
her love transformed his life.

01:34:21.870 --> 01:34:25.740
Denis would say things like,
"When Cindy goes somewhere even

01:34:25.740 --> 01:34:31.030
for a short while, it's
like God has died."

01:34:31.030 --> 01:34:34.320
This is my last story.

01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:37.200
I remember one afternoon
when Denis was giving a talk

01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:39.110
at the News School
in New York City.

01:34:39.110 --> 01:34:40.490
It was a rare appearance,

01:34:40.490 --> 01:34:42.680
totally sold out,
standing room only.

01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:45.030
It was raining, and
he got there late.

01:34:45.030 --> 01:34:47.650
Someone appeared and rushed
him through a side door

01:34:47.650 --> 01:34:48.990
and up onto the stage.

01:34:48.990 --> 01:34:51.700
And he got separated from Cindy.

01:34:51.700 --> 01:34:53.780
Another writer was
introducing him and going

01:34:53.780 --> 01:34:55.640
on a bit long with accolades.

01:34:55.640 --> 01:34:58.270
And I noticed Denis on
stage looking agitated.

01:34:58.270 --> 01:35:02.520
When he finally got to the mic,
he put his hand to his forehead

01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:04.190
to shade the bright light.

01:35:04.190 --> 01:35:07.570
And the first thing he
said was, "Cindy Lee?

01:35:07.570 --> 01:35:10.720
Honey? Where are you?"

01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:13.560
And she raised her arm and
called back, "I'm here."

01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:16.910
And he smiled his
incredible boyish smile

01:35:16.910 --> 01:35:18.310
at the sound of her voice.

01:35:18.310 --> 01:35:20.130
And he said, "I can't see you.

01:35:20.130 --> 01:35:21.940
Is your seat okay?

01:35:21.940 --> 01:35:23.240
Where are you?

01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:24.870
Can you stand up?"

01:35:24.870 --> 01:35:28.950
And she stood up and
said, "Yes, I'm okay.

01:35:28.950 --> 01:35:30.250
I'm here."

01:35:30.250 --> 01:35:33.580
And they smiled at
each other and flirted.

01:35:33.580 --> 01:35:36.360
And he said, "Alright then."

01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:39.210
And began to read a story.

01:35:39.210 --> 01:35:40.930
Alright then.

01:35:40.930 --> 01:35:43.080
It is my great honor

01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:47.510
to introduce my precious
friend, Cindy Lee Johnson.

01:35:47.510 --> 01:36:09.400
[ Applause ]

01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:10.700
&gt;&gt; Cindy Lee Johnson:
Good evening.

01:36:10.700 --> 01:36:12.000
Thank you, Elizabeth.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:13.300
Thank you to all
the panel members.

01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:16.120
What a wonderfully
unusual tribute.

01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:17.900
I love it.

01:36:17.900 --> 01:36:20.290
I also want to thank all
the ladies and gentlemen

01:36:20.290 --> 01:36:22.060
of the Library of Congress.

01:36:22.060 --> 01:36:24.380
For bestowing the esteemed Prize

01:36:24.380 --> 01:36:28.200
for American Fiction
upon my beloved husband.

01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:31.590
He so richly deserves it.

01:36:31.590 --> 01:36:35.160
When I met Denis,
he was 39 years old.

01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:36.830
And I immediately recognized him

01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:39.830
as the best-looking
man in the world.

01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:42.490
I fell in love straight away.

01:36:42.490 --> 01:36:44.870
Only later did I realize
he was the best writer

01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:48.110
in the world, in
my humble opinion.

01:36:48.110 --> 01:36:52.080
But he was also this
brave pilgrim soul.

01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:54.050
Who traveled the planet.

01:36:54.050 --> 01:36:57.720
From searching for
pirates in the Sulu Sea.

01:36:57.720 --> 01:37:01.110
To being the last American in
Somalia when the UN withdrew.

01:37:01.110 --> 01:37:06.740
And consider this from a
letter he wrote in 1991.

01:37:06.740 --> 01:37:11.220
"Dear Astronaut Selection
Officer, I am a civilian

01:37:11.220 --> 01:37:12.520
who would like to be considered

01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:16.310
for the one-year
astronaut training program."

01:37:16.310 --> 01:37:20.630
That's right, he tried
to go into space!

01:37:20.630 --> 01:37:23.740
[Laughter] He was like
a modern day Tom Sawyer.

01:37:23.740 --> 01:37:26.690
Often he would embark
with just a fishing vest.

01:37:26.690 --> 01:37:29.920
Filled with everything he
imagined he might need.

01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:33.490
And the faith that he would
encounter helpers, teachers,

01:37:33.490 --> 01:37:36.590
and guides along his path.

01:37:36.590 --> 01:37:39.190
And he always did.

01:37:39.190 --> 01:37:42.590
His life was a grand adventure.

01:37:42.590 --> 01:37:44.570
He loved this world.

01:37:44.570 --> 01:37:46.880
He loved his family.

01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:48.880
And he loved his work.

01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:52.150
I'm so grateful to
have his work.

01:37:52.150 --> 01:37:55.450
His light shines
through in his writing,

01:37:55.450 --> 01:37:57.340
and it's a gift to the world.

01:37:57.340 --> 01:38:03.300
But oh, how I miss that man.

01:38:03.300 --> 01:38:05.380
I will always love him.

01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:10.730
And so to close, a slideshow.

01:38:10.730 --> 01:38:12.030
I believe it will bear

01:38:12.030 --> 01:38:16.530
out my best-looking man
in the world comment.

01:38:16.530 --> 01:38:20.800
[Laughter] Also, please keep an
eye out for that fishing vest.

01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:22.560
Thank you.

01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:25.510
[ Applause ]

01:38:25.510 --> 01:41:37.510
[ Music ]

01:41:37.510 --> 01:41:49.040
[ Applause ]

01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:50.340
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper:
Thanks so much, Cindy,

01:41:50.340 --> 01:41:51.640
for helping us end
this celebration

01:41:51.640 --> 01:41:54.500
on such a personal
and powerful note.

01:41:54.500 --> 01:41:55.830
I'm Rob Casper.

01:41:55.830 --> 01:41:57.130
I'm the head of the Poetry

01:41:57.130 --> 01:41:58.620
and Literature Center
here at the Library.

01:41:58.620 --> 01:42:00.650
And I would like to
call Cindy and Elizabeth

01:42:00.650 --> 01:42:04.300
and all the participants from
tonight back out onto the stage.

01:42:04.300 --> 01:42:08.800
So please come on out,
Cindy and Elizabeth.

01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:23.510
Please join me in
thanking them again

01:42:23.510 --> 01:42:25.510
for an amazing, amazing night.

01:42:25.510 --> 01:43:02.090
[ Applause ]

01:43:02.090 --> 01:43:05.300
Thanks to all of you for coming.

01:43:05.300 --> 01:43:08.400
If you want to leave with a few
more books in your hand, our,

01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:10.850
our presenters will be
signing books next door

01:43:10.850 --> 01:43:12.340
in the Woodall Pavilion.

01:43:12.340 --> 01:43:15.770
Before you go to get as many
books as you can though.

01:43:15.770 --> 01:43:18.060
We ask that you please fill
out this survey that you got

01:43:18.060 --> 01:43:20.020
when you first walked
in the door.

01:43:20.020 --> 01:43:22.110
You can drop them
off in the back.

01:43:22.110 --> 01:43:24.430
We hope to see you here
in just a few weeks' time

01:43:24.430 --> 01:43:27.500
for our Poet Laureate
spring event.

01:43:27.500 --> 01:43:30.580
Until then, have a
good night, and again,

01:43:30.580 --> 01:43:32.880
thank you for coming out.

01:43:34.020 --> 01:43:37.880

of the Library of Congress.
