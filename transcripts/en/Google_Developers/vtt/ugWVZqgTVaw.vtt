BRETT MORGAN: Hello.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.200
I'm Brett Morgan from the
Google Maps Developer

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.760
Relations Team.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.950
This week, I'd like to show you
how to integrate Street

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.040
View imagery into your
application using the latest

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.000
version of the Google
Maps SDK for iOS.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.280
Google has captured street-level
panorama images

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.920
of more than 5 million miles
of road and continues to

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.350
update this imagery as
the world changes.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.610
Integrating Street View into
your application allows you to

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.470
give users context from the real
world that matches your

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:41.540
application.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.330
For example, let's say you're
making an application that

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.990
brings people together.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.280
Wouldn't it be nice to be able
to show people the pub that

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.490
they're going to meet at?

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.670
Or let's say you're making a
real estate sales application.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.596
Wouldn't it be nice to show
people their new front yard?

00:00:56.596 --> 00:01:00.320
All of Street View panoramas
are captures as 360 degree

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.520
images and are shown
in your application

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.940
using a special viewer.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.864
Let me show you how.

00:01:06.864 --> 00:01:09.600
The viewer on iOS is represented
by the GMS

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.810
panorama view class, similar
to a JMS map view class.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.710
I've created a new UI view
controller, and I'll add the

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.245
JMS panorama view object that
will fill the whole screen.

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:21.350
Once you've added the
viewer, you next

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.360
need to load an image.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.782
In this case, I'll load an image
near the coordinate that

00:01:24.782 --> 00:01:28.420
I know has a good view of the
Sydney Harbor Bridge.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.086
Let's take a look at
what we have now.

00:01:30.086 --> 00:01:33.380
The viewer allows your user
to zoom and pan the image.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.770
Ah, there's the bridge.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.520
You can also programmatically
control the

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.870
orientation of the camera.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.060
Let's change the code a bit so
that we start the picture of

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.640
the bridge.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.750
There we go.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.140
That's a whole lot better.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.510
Now when users launch the app,
they will see exactly the

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:48.870
right view.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.222
If you want to control
what the user of

00:01:50.222 --> 00:01:51.540
your application sees--

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.310
for example, if you're
presenting a slide show of

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.970
properties for sale-- you can
disable user-interactive

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.710
gestures by calling set all
gestures enabled no on your

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.080
JMS panorama view object.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.760
Setting the navigation links
hidden and street names hidden

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.210
to yes will enhance the slide
view aspect of your

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.160
application by hiding street
labels and navigation arrows,

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.660
leaving you with just the
wonderful houses for sale.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.890
Thank you for watching this
week's GDL on integrating

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.530
Street View into your
iOS applications.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.360
If you have any questions on the
techniques presented here

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.520
this week, please reach out to
us on either Google+ or on

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.990
Stack Overflow using the Google
Maps SDK iOS tag.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.240
Thank you for watching.
