Well, Sam, I want to say thank you. I feel like I've learned a lot

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.440
and I have built a really cool app,

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.880
and it's on my phone. that's pretty exciting.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.440
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.350
&gt;&gt; I guess, all that stuff we learned about. All the workflows, the

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.480
approvals, the, you know, dashboards and charts. Is that all in the phone too?

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.510
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So everything we built today is totally accounted

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.440
for and works both in the desktop or mobile app.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:24.720
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.610
&gt;&gt; So you simultaneously

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:26.750
built two apps today.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.830
&gt;&gt; That's really awesome. I guess my last

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.400
question is where do I go from here?

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.400
I mean, I'm hooked. I'm into this. I want to build more stuff. What should I do?

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.120
So I mean, we've only scratched the surface

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.870
of stuff that you can do with point and

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.450
click tools, so you can learn a little

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.450
bit more about what else we could do there.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.540
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. you could maybe read about Apex and Visual Force,

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.130
and you know, get into the programmatic code side of things.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.710
&gt;&gt; Okay. Or you could take the

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.720
skills that we've learned today and then build your app. What do you want to do?

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.100
&gt;&gt; Let's do that. I want to build another app. Alright, let's do it.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.110
&gt;&gt; Congratulations. You created an app and you went mobile. It's pretty

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.600
exciting. But really, it's just the tip of the iceberg, there's so

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.470
much more you can do in Salesforce. I'm really excited to see

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.940
what you're going to do in your final project. Are you ready to start?
