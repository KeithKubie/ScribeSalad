simple but that's pretty much it I mean

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540
simple but that's pretty much it I mean
 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.530
simple but that's pretty much it I mean
commercial success it's interesting you

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540
commercial success it's interesting you
 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.729
commercial success it's interesting you
know having commercial successes and

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739
know having commercial successes and
 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.259
know having commercial successes and
it's interesting to be part of that

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269
it's interesting to be part of that
 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.020
it's interesting to be part of that
process especially because we live in a

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030
process especially because we live in a
 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.830
process especially because we live in a
culture that's so fame-obsessed so it's

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840
culture that's so fame-obsessed so it's
 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.050
culture that's so fame-obsessed so it's
interesting to see it from both sides

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060
interesting to see it from both sides
 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.190
interesting to see it from both sides
but for me the only virtue or the only

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200
but for me the only virtue or the only
 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.180
but for me the only virtue or the only
value that commercial success has is it

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190
value that commercial success has is it
 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.110
value that commercial success has is it
enables you to have an audience for your

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120
enables you to have an audience for your
 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.140
enables you to have an audience for your
music and so for me commercial success

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150
music and so for me commercial success
 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.960
music and so for me commercial success
is like a strategy to try and get more

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970
is like a strategy to try and get more
 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.100
is like a strategy to try and get more
people to actually listen to the music

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110
people to actually listen to the music
 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.830
people to actually listen to the music
like commercial success is not a end in

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840
like commercial success is not a end in
 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.120
like commercial success is not a end in
