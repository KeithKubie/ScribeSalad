00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:01.340
x = 4.

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:08.420
This time we had to subtract 12 from
both sides to get x on its own.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.347
And then we get x + 0 = 16- 12.

00:00:13.347 --> 00:00:20.040
x + 0 is the same thing as x,
which equals 16 minus 12 which equals 4.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.644
So x equals 4.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.440
Notice that to isolate the variable
terms in these equations

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.580
we either added or subtracted.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.280
So here we added and here we subtracted.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.620
We subtracted if in the original
equation we were adding the constant.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.710
And we added when we were
originally subtracting.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.070
We're basically trying to undo
what's done on the same side as x.
