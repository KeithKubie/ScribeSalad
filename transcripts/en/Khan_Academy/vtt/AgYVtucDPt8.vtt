00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.063
- [Instructor] Where we
left off in the last video,

00:00:02.063 --> 00:00:06.230
Alexander dies in 323 BCE,
at the young age of 32.

00:00:07.736 --> 00:00:09.986
And even though he conquered
all of this territory,

00:00:09.986 --> 00:00:12.404
it was a very short-lived empire.

00:00:12.404 --> 00:00:15.753
And what happens next is a period known

00:00:15.753 --> 00:00:19.222
as the Wars of the Diadochi, and let me

00:00:19.222 --> 00:00:22.502
write down this word, Diadochi.

00:00:22.502 --> 00:00:25.502
Diadochi translates into successors,

00:00:27.252 --> 00:00:29.251
and these are the various leaders,

00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:31.907
and mainly generals, of Alexander

00:00:31.907 --> 00:00:35.407
who then fought for control of the empire.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.502
It's a very bloody
period, a lot of different

00:00:39.502 --> 00:00:41.472
Diadochi going after each other,

00:00:41.472 --> 00:00:43.785
or after each other's families,

00:00:43.785 --> 00:00:46.588
and what eventually happens
over the next few decades

00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:49.485
is Alexander's empire, the empire that he

00:00:49.485 --> 00:00:53.652
establishes, gets split up
into a few major empires.

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.068
What you see on this
map here, you see most

00:00:58.068 --> 00:01:01.985
of Persia, and the Anatolian
Peninsula right over here,

00:01:01.985 --> 00:01:06.667
really the bulk of the old
Achaemenid Persian Empire.

00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:09.368
It gets under control of Seleucus,

00:01:09.368 --> 00:01:11.857
and he establishes the Seleucid dynasty,

00:01:11.857 --> 00:01:13.924
the Seleucid Empire.

00:01:13.924 --> 00:01:15.407
Let me write this down right here.

00:01:15.407 --> 00:01:18.824
This is Seleucid, so the Seleucid Empire.

00:01:21.106 --> 00:01:24.523
Egypt right over here,
this gets taken control

00:01:24.523 --> 00:01:27.940
of another general of Alexander, Ptolemy,

00:01:29.291 --> 00:01:32.756
and he establishes the Ptolemaic Empire

00:01:32.756 --> 00:01:34.907
and the Ptolemaic dynasty.

00:01:34.907 --> 00:01:35.740
Ptolemaic.

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.805
And then Macedon ends up under control

00:01:40.805 --> 00:01:42.739
once again of another Diadochi,

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:44.272
remember the Diadochi are the successors,

00:01:44.272 --> 00:01:47.024
all of these characters right over here.

00:01:47.024 --> 00:01:49.972
These are three of the various Diadochi,

00:01:49.972 --> 00:01:53.188
three of the more successful
Diadochi right over here.

00:01:53.188 --> 00:01:56.738
But what the Macedonian components

00:01:56.738 --> 00:01:59.655
of Alexander's Empire, for the most part,

00:01:59.655 --> 00:02:03.422
end up under the control
of Antigonus's dynasty,

00:02:03.422 --> 00:02:07.221
which ends up being called
the Antigonid dynasty.

00:02:07.221 --> 00:02:08.054
Antigonid.

00:02:10.454 --> 00:02:13.413
And this, and as you can see, it's not all

00:02:13.413 --> 00:02:15.204
of the empire Alexander established.

00:02:15.204 --> 00:02:17.903
What we have in red here,
these are independent

00:02:17.903 --> 00:02:20.297
states that did not get subsumed

00:02:20.297 --> 00:02:24.464
into the Seleucid, the Ptolemaic,
or the Antigonid Empires,

00:02:26.275 --> 00:02:28.709
You can imagine, over the
next several hundred years,

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.774
they're going back and forth, there's an

00:02:30.774 --> 00:02:34.041
ebb and flow of control
of these various empires,

00:02:34.041 --> 00:02:36.040
but these are the three most significant,

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.908
especially the Ptolemaic and the Seleucid.

00:02:39.908 --> 00:02:42.190
What this establishes is what a lot

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.907
of historians refer to as a new period

00:02:44.907 --> 00:02:47.673
of especially this part of the world.

00:02:47.673 --> 00:02:51.406
When we go from shortly
before the Persian invasions

00:02:51.406 --> 00:02:53.723
of Greece all the way
to Alexander the Great,

00:02:53.723 --> 00:02:55.928
we refer to that as Classical Greece,

00:02:55.928 --> 00:02:59.428
but now we're going from Classical Greece,

00:03:02.862 --> 00:03:04.712
with the death of
Alexander in the beginning

00:03:04.712 --> 00:03:07.711
of the Wars of the Diadochi for control,

00:03:07.711 --> 00:03:09.935
this sets up a new period, often referred

00:03:09.935 --> 00:03:13.185
to by historians as Hellenistic Period.

00:03:20.886 --> 00:03:23.170
And the Hellenistic Period is referring

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.337
to the fact that all of this territory

00:03:27.502 --> 00:03:29.703
that was conquered by Alexander the Great,

00:03:29.703 --> 00:03:32.319
and later gets split after
the Wars of the Diadochi

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.087
between these Diadochi
establishing these various empires,

00:03:36.087 --> 00:03:38.753
they had huge influence of Greek culture.

00:03:38.753 --> 00:03:42.986
You had ruling dynasties
that were essentially Greek,

00:03:42.986 --> 00:03:44.786
whether you're in Ptolemaic Egypt,

00:03:44.786 --> 00:03:48.436
Seleucid Persia, or Antigonid Macedonia.

00:03:48.436 --> 00:03:49.636
Obviously the Macedonians were already

00:03:49.636 --> 00:03:51.969
a very strong Greek culture.

00:03:53.765 --> 00:03:57.931
And it's a time where you have the spread

00:03:57.931 --> 00:04:00.981
of the culture, you have
a bit of fulfillment

00:04:00.981 --> 00:04:05.148
of Alexander the Great's
goal of creating this very,

00:04:05.998 --> 00:04:09.181
this mashup, so to speak,
of the various cultures

00:04:09.181 --> 00:04:12.207
of the region, the Greco, and the Persian,

00:04:12.207 --> 00:04:14.581
and the Egyptian cultures.

00:04:14.581 --> 00:04:17.430
Now the Hellenistic Period starts to end

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.430
as each of these various
empires get overthrown.

00:04:22.464 --> 00:04:27.046
The Seleucid Empire, in
the third century BCE,

00:04:27.046 --> 00:04:30.778
it gets more and more overtaken
by the Parthian Empire.

00:04:30.778 --> 00:04:33.861
Parthia starts as a satrap, a region,

00:04:35.453 --> 00:04:37.142
of the Seleucid Empire, but it eventually

00:04:37.142 --> 00:04:39.375
takes control over much of Persia.

00:04:39.375 --> 00:04:41.358
So this is the Parthanian, sorry,

00:04:41.358 --> 00:04:44.441
the Parthian Empire, right over here.

00:04:50.025 --> 00:04:52.842
And the last vestiges
of the Seleucid Empire

00:04:52.842 --> 00:04:55.725
are eventually defeated
by the Roman legions,

00:04:55.725 --> 00:04:57.624
and you'll see this is a common trend here

00:04:57.624 --> 00:05:00.007
because, at the time of Alexander,

00:05:00.007 --> 00:05:03.460
on the Italian peninsula, you start having

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.308
a city-state that's becoming
more and more powerful,

00:05:06.308 --> 00:05:08.191
and more and more of an empire.

00:05:08.191 --> 00:05:10.758
And as we will see, it starts to subsume

00:05:10.758 --> 00:05:14.207
a lot of the regions we talked about.

00:05:14.207 --> 00:05:17.124
Ptolemaic Egypt, it gets overthrown

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.810
by the Roman Empire in 30 BCE,

00:05:21.706 --> 00:05:24.957
and the Antigonid dynasty gets overthrown

00:05:24.957 --> 00:05:26.973
by the Roman Empire,
they're actually the first

00:05:26.973 --> 00:05:31.056
to get overthrown by the
Roman Empire, in 168 BC.

00:05:32.273 --> 00:05:34.606
So this period, this Hellenistic Period,

00:05:34.606 --> 00:05:37.039
the takeaway, it's a
period, I'm talking about

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:40.006
hundreds of years in a matter
of five or six minutes,

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:42.589
but this is a period
where you had significant

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:45.821
Greek influence over a very large period,

00:05:45.821 --> 00:05:49.356
or a very large area of
land, and it eventually ends

00:05:49.356 --> 00:05:51.455
with a lot of the western portions

00:05:51.455 --> 00:05:54.855
falling under Roman control,
and the eastern portions,

00:05:54.855 --> 00:05:58.860
especially Persia, falling
under Parthian control.
