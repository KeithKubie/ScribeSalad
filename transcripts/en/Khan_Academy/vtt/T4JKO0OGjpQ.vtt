00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.370
Let's write 113.9% as a decimal.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.080
So percent, this
symbol right over here,

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.890
literally means per hundred.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:16.400
So this is the same
thing as 113.9 per 100,

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.770
which is the same thing
as 113.9 divided by 100.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.020
So essentially, if we want
to write this as a decimal,

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.300
we just take a 113.9,
and we divide it by 100.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.950
And to do that,
113.9 divided by 100.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.800
If you divide by 10, you move
the decimal once to the left.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.450
If you divide by 100, you're
moving the decimal twice

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.950
to the left.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.533
If we're doing it by 1,000, we
would go to the left once more.

00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:44.780
10,000, each time
you divide by 10,

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.410
you'd go one step to the left,
which hopefully makes sense.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.970
If we were to multiply by 10,
we would be moving the decimal

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.845
over to the right, and
there are other videos

00:00:51.845 --> 00:00:54.240
that go into far more depth
on the intuition behind that.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.070
But anyway, we're
dividing 113.9 by 100,

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.860
so move the decimal
two spaces to the left.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.470
So the decimal will
end up right over here.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.910
So this will be equal to 1.139.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.598
And we are done.
