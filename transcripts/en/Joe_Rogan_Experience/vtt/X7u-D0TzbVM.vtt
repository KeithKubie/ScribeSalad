1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.150
The Joe Rogan experience from 81 to 88 all I did was taekwondo.

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.000
That's all I did.
Dodged it all.
February,

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.500
1919 79 was the day my life went downhill.
You know why?
Why I got my one,

4
00:00:13.501 --> 00:00:16.380
I want a form in a karate tournament.
I was a purple belt.

5
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.960
I was in the eighth grade and then I lost the fighting.

6
00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:22.710
I got disqualified for kicking above the fucking face.
You were really young.

7
00:00:22.711 --> 00:00:27.120
How old were you?
I was 13 or 14 it was on my contact and I got out of Goshen,

8
00:00:27.121 --> 00:00:30.480
rue karate and you know,
I liked those guys.

9
00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:33.150
That's why I missed that whole thing because on the weekends we just got a

10
00:00:33.151 --> 00:00:35.680
different fucking tournament's.
You know when you do that?
When I was a kid,

11
00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:36.780
you just go to different tournament's.

12
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.540
On Saturdays we would all geek out and go to Honda.

13
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.230
You know what a Honda is in New York?
That's a big martial arts supplies.
Yeah.

14
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.120
I would geek out now,
like I get to Lynn checks on neutron stars,
caboodle,

15
00:00:48.121 --> 00:00:51.440
Tom Flores.
I get the fucking things that you can punch the clock.

16
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.070
She's Maki Juarez.
I had to fucking the fucking

17
00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.450
the fucking thing.
The juice you put on your palms.
Yeah,
I was the real deal.

18
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.520
You know that was watching Chinese connection was the last time you want Chinese

19
00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:06.660
guy tonight when everybody goes to sleep put on Bruce Lee's second movie.

20
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.733
Do me that favor.

21
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.260
Give me that fucking famous and you're going to see what fucking unreal is.

22
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.450
Put up some Bruce leads.

23
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.910
You're going to see the last scene of Chinese connection.

24
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.900
The last scene when he goes into the school,
listen to what he says.

25
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.680
Remember Chinese connection is,
is kind of a rip off of the Spaghetti Westerns.

26
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.230
If you watch those three movies Clay's would made in Italy.

27
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.850
There's so far with gun like you haven't watched them in 20 years watching the

28
00:01:32.851 --> 00:01:36.510
good,
the bad,
and yet what's the tiny paint?
The town red.
I don't remember that.

29
00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:40.490
That was a great,
that was a great move to came back as a ghost.
Stories,

30
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.120
a go story and Chinese connection.

31
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.990
He comes back as a student that they kill his teacher and he avenges his teacher

32
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.050
and it just the new chuck scene and the Chinese connection.

33
00:01:50.051 --> 00:01:53.310
When he first attacks the school,
when he goes in and he goes,

34
00:01:53.311 --> 00:01:56.850
I'm allowing you to leave.
Who allows you to leave?
Even in Bronx Tale,

35
00:01:56.851 --> 00:01:58.710
they lock the fucking door and they wouldn't let the bike is.

36
00:01:58.711 --> 00:02:02.220
Leave this right here.
Look at this.
This changed America forever.

37
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.180
This was 1970 look at this guys.
Watch this.

38
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.270
I still remember the fucking commercial for this.
The trailer.

39
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.820
Look at how slow and methodical,

40
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.590
<v 1>look at this man.
Ladies and gentlemen,
look at him</v>

41
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.010
and they all live with Steve Mcqueen head and Steve Mcqueen was when he had you

42
00:02:24.011 --> 00:02:25.720
talk about Lee is forearms.

43
00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.590
This guy's crowns was seven times the size of a man and nobody had ever see

44
00:02:29.591 --> 00:02:34.060
anybody kicking like this before.
1970 nobody ever seen nothing like this.

45
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.230
I remember being in Catholic school at sacred heart school for boys and seeing

46
00:02:38.231 --> 00:02:41.440
this and losing my fucking mind,
but this isn't nothing.

47
00:02:41.441 --> 00:02:44.140
I'm going to show you the scene with James America forever,
right here.

48
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.260
The double points for both of them right here.
Bam,
right here.

49
00:02:47.261 --> 00:02:49.870
This changed America forever,
right here.
Ladies and gentlemen,

50
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.610
that double.
Nobody's ever done that right chest.
When they say,

51
00:02:57.611 --> 00:03:01.260
why watch all this says Joe Rogan.
This is all beauty.

52
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.640
This will never happen again.

53
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.520
All right,
this is an American chains for it.
Oh,
one guy hit him in the back.

54
00:03:15.521 --> 00:03:20.360
This fucked up.
He's forever.
Right here.
The Guy fucked up.

55
00:03:20.361 --> 00:03:21.570
He kicks him in the bathroom.

56
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.790
It was 1970 nobody had ever seen new in Chauvet before that.

57
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.000
How many times you hit yourself on the back of the head?
Do a new trucks rob.

58
00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.680
Man in the back of my head with bruises.
Fuck.
I probably have more PTSD.

59
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.020
Forget get hit in the head by my own nunchucks chucks ever getting punched my

60
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.640
man fucking hard.
Those Coco Bolo ones from centrally martial arts supply,

61
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.620
Coco Bolo,
nunchucks they were fucking like a pound each.

62
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.020
They bounce off the back of your head.
I still feel knots in my head.

63
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.020
I still feel knots in bag in my head from what

64
00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.710
you supposed to go up and catch it behind you.

65
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.710
But I was going this way and catching it like that.
I was,

66
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:17.860
I didn't know what I was doing.
I was ad libbing,

67
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.490
whacking myself on the back of the head,
just going,
oh fuck.

68
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.680
<v 0>And then right back to it.
This is just this,
this is too much.</v>

69
00:04:25.681 --> 00:04:29.160
I remember still going back to school that Monday and kids will lose me.

70
00:04:29.161 --> 00:04:31.410
I still remember the drive in theater.
I saw this set.

71
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.770
We'll put that final fight scene because that's one of the greatest,

72
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.120
he jumps over a table and flying sidekicks,
motherfucker.
No stocks,
no nothing.

73
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.140
He gets the tastes of from a guy born.
He fights.
This is the end.
This is the end.

74
00:04:43.141 --> 00:04:43.974
When they got to kill them.

75
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.740
<v 1>Look at Bruce Lee and he just stands there looking at me.</v>

76
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.980
Fucking just runs out of its before.
Is he single handedly

77
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.600
<v 2>made being Chinese sexy</v>

78
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.410
<v 0>Donk,
donk,
donk,
donk,
donk,
donk,
donk,
donk.
Ah,
that's the song.</v>

79
00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.640
But Ah,
ah,
ah.
This is my life dog.

80
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.940
<v 1>Who would stay at the movie theaters till midnight Til fucking midnight.
We'd</v>

81
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.350
just just,
this is just too much.
Yeah.
I don't think anybody today

82
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.880
<v 2>Jay can realize what an impact that guy had on kids.</v>

83
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.390
I was living in Newark and I was at an apartment building and uh,

84
00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.880
the superintendent of the building,
his kid was my age.

85
00:05:18.881 --> 00:05:19.714
I used to go over his house.

86
00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.450
That's how I found out about Bruce Lee hit him in his,

87
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.480
he had an older brother and they were really into Bruce Lee and they were,

88
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.300
you know,
you have like Bruce Lee posters and shit.
And I was like,
Whoa,

89
00:05:28.301 --> 00:05:31.570
what is this Bruce Lee chef here you guys are into?
And then from there,

90
00:05:31.571 --> 00:05:34.510
I'm pretty sure we went to see a movie together.
I think we went,
it was dad.

91
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.730
That was the first time I was exposed to it.
I was like,

92
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.040
maybe five or six and I was like,
oh my God.

93
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.670
<v 0>He taught this country so many fucking things at the time.</v>

94
00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.770
Like people would just,
you know,
made everybody,

95
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.170
but it even strengthened like rebellious.
Like if you watch enter the dragon,

96
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:50.640
there's a part of that.

97
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.120
You never caught this as a pointless to a dragon with a guy comes in Bob Wall

98
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.320
and he goes,
I know Bob.
I know Bob.
He goes,

99
00:05:57.321 --> 00:06:01.460
you must attend the morning ritual and uniform.
Who?
She tells him outside,

100
00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:05.230
he throws the punches and shit and the next day he's dressed in white dick about

101
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.460
that.
Everybody had a gian.
Brucely refused to wear a fucking gain.

102
00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.930
It wasn't Eddie's grandfather.
He just refused to wear a fucking g.

103
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.750
That's the kind of mentality you put in these kids.

104
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.370
That's why these kids are getting bit slap.

105
00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.250
Do you think it Brucey was around lake people be getting bullied?

106
00:06:19.251 --> 00:06:22.340
Nobody got bullied when I was a kid because you watch Bruce Lee,
Bro,

107
00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:23.930
he gave you fucking walls.

108
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.920
Would you please put that last [inaudible] talking about this?
I got bullied.

109
00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.640
They got bullied by people who are trying to be brutally to connection,

110
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.710
fire fighting in the end.
Trust me,
it's on it.

111
00:06:33.711 --> 00:06:35.240
I just watched it the other day on Youtube.

112
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:40.520
I was watching this shit the other day crying.
This is tremendous.
Brothers.

113
00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:44.060
It's hard to look back when you look back at that and see the kind of impact

114
00:06:44.061 --> 00:06:45.730
that had at the time.
It's just,

115
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.830
it's hard to wrap your head around it because nobody had ever seen anything like

116
00:06:48.831 --> 00:06:52.340
that before.
There had been no karate movies and all of a sudden,
I mean,

117
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.760
maybe there was a couple,
but it was nothing like five fingers of death came out.

118
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:59.330
There was a two or three then this guy in Vail and the beauty of this was,

119
00:06:59.331 --> 00:07:04.130
and I told us I want to Ari's storytellers,
that especially for me dog,
you know,

120
00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.120
before Bruce Lee,
everybody was walk Chinese people,

121
00:07:07.121 --> 00:07:08.930
especially with walking around,
they were the help bro.

122
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.280
They would've fucking helped.
He walked around half retarded.
This leak came out.

123
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.250
Bruce,
they high in his shirts and bowing that motherfuckers,

124
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.670
Bruce Lee came on and gave them this inner strength.
But for me,

125
00:07:19.671 --> 00:07:21.740
I wasn't in Chinese.
I was Cuban,
I was an immigrant.

126
00:07:21.741 --> 00:07:25.490
I knew what it was to walk around feeling like you.
And number two.
So for me,

127
00:07:25.491 --> 00:07:28.970
he fucking strengthen my head just watching that shit like that Chinese

128
00:07:28.971 --> 00:07:30.170
motherfucker do that.
I could do that.

129
00:07:30.171 --> 00:07:33.500
Then my stepfather would come home cause I used to go to karate and my

130
00:07:33.501 --> 00:07:36.410
stepfather go,
what'd you learn today?
And I teach them,
they go don't work on me.

131
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.560
And I go what the fuck are you?
You know what I'm saying?

132
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.050
It just worked at the karate school and don't work here.
And he would tell him,

133
00:07:43.051 --> 00:07:43.810
you know why no one,

134
00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:46.670
cause I smacked the shit out of Bruce Lee and Cuba one time and I believe him.

135
00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.940
Why is he would tell them I fucked Bruce Lee up one time on the corner cube.

136
00:07:49.941 --> 00:07:52.920
I bitch slept in that.
That Chinese guy,
he was bullshitting me.
The man,

137
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:55.250
my mother would tell me Batman was a Faggot,

138
00:07:55.700 --> 00:08:00.670
you know shit like that [inaudible] scene.
That's it.
Oh no,

139
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.500
that's the,
you got to speed it up a little bit more.
But what?
Fuck,

140
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.720
we'll take that too.
What's this one?

141
00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.970
He was also the first guy that was like really shredded like that and movies

142
00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:14.600
were taking showers is a good place.
There's when he fights Mrs Suzuki,

143
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:18.170
this is what the saw,
look at this guys.
This is just tremendous.

144
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:22.230
Was there ever a guy that was like shirtless and movies?

145
00:08:22.231 --> 00:08:26.850
It was flexing before him.
Was that a thing?
Does the guy was ripped Hercules.

146
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.230
Yeah,
but not like a fighter guy.
Right?
Tarzan.
Tarzan.

147
00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:34.740
Because everything else was after like a hard times Bronson.
That was much later.

148
00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:38.700
Right.
Oh look at this fight.
Look at his fight.
He will will Ferrell,

149
00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.640
but not just play this fight off the Joe.

150
00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:44.580
There's one scene in here where you look at him and you go,

151
00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:47.310
well you know why he couldn't be fake,
but look at his hand speed.

152
00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:49.380
There wasn't no speed ups and filming this.

153
00:08:49.381 --> 00:08:51.270
There wasn't nothing this fight with this.

154
00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:53.520
This guy I think was a Russian that was coming to visit them,

155
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.160
but this just tremendous hole

156
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.980
<v 1>from the fucking time he walks in.
It's a 20 minute fight.</v>

157
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:02.820
The first movie does is a spinning elbow front.
Kay.

158
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:07.050
Who does that?
So he walked,
he walked.
There was two Japanese is right here.

159
00:09:07.051 --> 00:09:10.380
We can see it right here.
No,
before that he goes like this.
He walks up.
Yeah.

160
00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.150
You gotta get to the microphone,
man.

161
00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:19.230
They don't do that shit no more.
Don't do that shit.
Put that.

162
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.310
I didn't even hear what you said.

163
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:23.370
He's playing the sound and you're talking to months.
All this shit.

164
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:30.960
Oh my God.
The guy,
the white belt.
What's his,
what's his hammer?
What's the speed?

165
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:35.910
Watch his fucking speed dog.
This is 1970 there was no speed up films.

166
00:09:35.911 --> 00:09:40.710
It's also the sounds that he made but crazy.
Don't play that music.

167
00:09:40.711 --> 00:09:44.550
Fine.
Watch this spinning.
What's this?

168
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:47.890
Are you fucking kidding me?
Pressing.
Watch this band.

169
00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:52.200
This motherfucker didn't stop.
Now this fight scene by Ho sensibly

170
00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:56.320
<v 4>the movie theaters at my boys and we watched this and then we'd go next door to</v>

171
00:09:56.321 --> 00:09:58.980
mark was Donald's fruits and we knock all the fucking food plots.

172
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:04.350
<v 1>Why would the guy got him in the arm up,
bro?
This is real.
This is 20 Oh my God.</v>

173
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:08.450
Bruce Lee.
He fucked up that guy.
Had any technique.
What do you do?
They bite him.

174
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:12.930
He let go because of a bite.
He bit him in the fucking ankle.
Real fucking hard.

175
00:10:12.931 --> 00:10:16.950
This kid arm bar technique for 1970 or whatever it was.
What year was this?

176
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:19.390
Just came out?
This was the original heroin movie.

177
00:10:19.391 --> 00:10:22.990
Just came out like in 70 [inaudible] look at him.
Dogs.
They starts trending.

178
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.570
<v 4>This motherfucker was asked if you ever watched the challenge detection,</v>

179
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:30.210
you're fucking up.
And he's like Steve McQueen.
I mean 10 minutes.

180
00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:33.080
Cause he's really angry in this movie because they killed his teaching.

181
00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.193
He's fucking up.

182
00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:37.790
<v 1>I hate this fucking movie.
Who's on the phone with Steve Mcqueen?
Sleek.</v>

183
00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:41.530
Me mean talking to him.
Tell him what do I do next?
Beat the fuck up that.

184
00:10:41.531 --> 00:10:45.470
Watch this.
This Steve McQueen's in the movies and we were standing.
Bow is buses.

185
00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:49.690
Joe Rogan watch this.
Joe Rogan.
Oh,
come on now.

186
00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.640
That guy just ate a wheel kit.
This is unrealistic.
It's that quick.

187
00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.820
But the guy when you get wheeled,
you're gonna face.
Dude,

188
00:10:57.821 --> 00:11:02.620
nobody would start shit bro.
It's,
this is awesome though.

189
00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:06.270
This is tremendous.
It was the last time you saw this still good.
Well wait,
wait.

190
00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:09.670
The wait the wait this fucking seat.
This is just too much.
You know,
look,

191
00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:15.520
his technique is really fucking good.
It's really good to this day.
I mean,

192
00:11:15.521 --> 00:11:20.440
it's hard to see someone do martial arts from back then and compare it to what

193
00:11:20.441 --> 00:11:24.790
you see today.
But Bruce Lee compares.
It's really good kicking technique,
man.

194
00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:27.730
Like his sidekick it straight.
He's not kicking,

195
00:11:27.731 --> 00:11:30.430
I don't know if he's hit comes up,
it goes straight.

196
00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:33.310
That's where it gets good with Faiza.

197
00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:38.020
Fuck this motherfucker up right now for Joe Rogan.
Zukie was this Joe Rogan.

198
00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:42.010
Watch this.
Watch this dog,
old school,

199
00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.940
old school fucked up.

200
00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:49.450
[inaudible]
fuck dog.

201
00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:53.980
They makes it crazy screen when he karate act now he goes

202
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:56.530
<v 0>after Suzuki.
He fucks up Suzuki.</v>

203
00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.620
Then it goes back to the school and they tell him,
you know,

204
00:11:59.621 --> 00:12:02.290
you gotta go do some time and he fucking grabs the guy and he goes,
listen,

205
00:12:02.291 --> 00:12:05.320
don't touch my school.
I'll fuck you up.
Then he walks outside.

206
00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:07.690
He agreed to do time.
This is the beauty about Bruce Lee.

207
00:12:07.691 --> 00:12:08.860
He's agreed to do the time.

208
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.360
He walks out and he opens the door and they're all there to shoot him.

209
00:12:13.361 --> 00:12:16.300
That's the scene you see.
He could have turned around and ran away.

210
00:12:16.301 --> 00:12:17.320
That motherfucker looked at him.

211
00:12:17.321 --> 00:12:20.710
Yellville ran out into the audience and it ends with him doing a fly psychic and

212
00:12:20.711 --> 00:12:23.560
you hear the bullets going on and you're just ready to go kill somebody.

213
00:12:23.561 --> 00:12:26.890
At that point it's midnight and I'm going to tell them on a fuck.

214
00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:32.200
I'm fucking somebody up tonight.
And that's how he left you off.
That was it.

215
00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:36.190
And then return to the dragon came out with Chuck Norris and that was kind of,

216
00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:38.860
ah,
people,
pat can let me know.
He didn't die.

217
00:12:38.861 --> 00:12:43.480
It enter the dragon came out July of 73 and he was dead.
Maybe a week later.

218
00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:45.760
He died a week after until the dragon came out.

219
00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:50.470
He died July something [inaudible] 73 so I was 10 let me tell you something.

220
00:12:50.471 --> 00:12:51.041
When he died,

221
00:12:51.041 --> 00:12:54.130
you have no idea what this country was like because there was no internet.

222
00:12:54.131 --> 00:12:56.950
You had to find out by going to Chinatown.
That was the proof.

223
00:12:56.951 --> 00:12:59.890
You've got to go to Chinatown and buy the magazines and they showed you the

224
00:12:59.891 --> 00:13:02.670
black and white pictures of him.
They carried him and his wake,

225
00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:06.490
Kareem Abdul Jabbar and James Coburn.
It wasn't,
there was no newspaper.

226
00:13:06.491 --> 00:13:08.830
Nobody cared about some Chinese guy that was,

227
00:13:08.831 --> 00:13:12.310
we didn't find that until a month after he died that they sent us the letter by

228
00:13:12.311 --> 00:13:13.750
the fucking in a bottle with a note.

229
00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.930
<v 2>You know what's really fascinating about him,
man,</v>

230
00:13:15.931 --> 00:13:20.370
he made his movies and all of his like scenes with these wild kicks and jumping

231
00:13:20.371 --> 00:13:21.270
fine techniques,

232
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:26.280
but in real life when he practiced martial arts for fighting for like,

233
00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:27.720
he never did any of that stuff.

234
00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:32.010
He concentrated on like low kicks and punches and boxing techniques mixed with

235
00:13:32.011 --> 00:13:33.000
wrestling techniques,

236
00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:36.870
but he just knew that it would be spectacular looking spectacular.
Yeah.

237
00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:38.890
<v 0>Jody is Adam's his time.
Got You.</v>

238
00:13:38.891 --> 00:13:42.790
Really want to get to society way that to the film industry.
What he did,

239
00:13:42.791 --> 00:13:46.360
he brought something that was just brilliant and then you watch enter the
dragon.

240
00:13:46.361 --> 00:13:49.900
When they just cashed them out.
They just said,
listen,
you're coming back with us.

241
00:13:49.901 --> 00:13:52.000
And then the Chinese people got mad and that was heroin money.

242
00:13:52.001 --> 00:13:55.030
They made those movies for $10 and Thailand or what the fuck?

243
00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.100
<v 2>So he had some sort of crazy,</v>

244
00:13:57.101 --> 00:14:00.330
there's some crazy conspiracy theory about his death that it was the absolute

245
00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:04.290
Chinese mob that killed him because he owed money and money.

246
00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.550
He just took money out of their pocket.
When he left,

247
00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:09.060
he went out with a born abroad.
You think that's what happened?
Did they kill us?

248
00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:11.500
What happened?
If really what make them barrels and money?

249
00:14:11.501 --> 00:14:14.830
How much money do you think the Chinese connection costs to shoot what they

250
00:14:14.831 --> 00:14:16.600
think they paid those Thailand people?
Well,

251
00:14:16.601 --> 00:14:21.130
it's kind of crazy when you find out this son died as well and died because

252
00:14:21.131 --> 00:14:24.390
there was a bullet in a gun was supposed to be a blank gun or it had a piece in

253
00:14:24.391 --> 00:14:25.660
it or something like that.
There's something in it.

254
00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:29.830
If you were thinking like that,
some really crazy,

255
00:14:29.831 --> 00:14:34.000
really rich Chinese gangster guy won his son dead as well.

256
00:14:34.001 --> 00:14:36.580
Some real old school kingus Khan type shit.

257
00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:39.550
Kill the man and then and then put a hit on his son and that,

258
00:14:39.551 --> 00:14:43.030
that's how it went down.
I mean,
I don't know what happened to him.
I don't know.

259
00:14:43.031 --> 00:14:46.870
But that's always been the conspiracy theory.
It's people,
you know,

260
00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.980
people love those kinds of crazy stories.
They love the crank.
Crazy story of,

261
00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:52.190
you know,
a curse

262
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:57.190
<v 0>on him or,
or thought about milk.
Crucial.
The Samurai touches back like getting</v>

263
00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.570
touched him with the murder touch.
But it is crazy.
We've got a blood clot,

264
00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:06.350
Brandon believe was killed.
I thought it was this,
this was my philosophy on it.

265
00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:09.770
The Dea never talks about heroin coming from Chinese.

266
00:15:09.771 --> 00:15:12.560
Chinese been bringing heroin into this country since Jesus loves Chicago,

267
00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.830
but they,
that's smart.
That's smart.
They don't flaunt it.

268
00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.360
When you see a Chinese restaurant,
what do you see?

269
00:15:17.361 --> 00:15:20.420
You see 50 people where you see white people in there serving and know the whole

270
00:15:20.421 --> 00:15:22.790
family's in.
Then when you want a good Chinese restaurant,
what do you see?

271
00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:25.910
You see the kid in the two kids doing homework at the table,
don't you?

272
00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:29.610
The whole family runs it.
They all move in together.
They all do all that shit.

273
00:15:29.611 --> 00:15:32.890
So they know they're not Puerto Rican is bro and not fucking I Italians that bio

274
00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.240
Lincoln compliment.
Oh look at me.

275
00:15:35.241 --> 00:15:38.060
They can keep it low that they never could get busted.

276
00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.610
They have such a great system to try ads.

277
00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:44.540
Those Chinese gangsters number that the mafia concept is not Italian.

278
00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.200
It's Chinese.
It's shy fucking knees.
So Spaghetti,

279
00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.980
well I don't know about so that yeah,
noodles.
Noodles came from China.

280
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:55.400
They brought her to Italy.
The Italians came over to China,
found noodles,

281
00:15:55.401 --> 00:15:59.700
brought it back to Italy and said,
oh we made me and Balmy Migs.
We got them into,

282
00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.820
there's some Chinese dragon or some power.

283
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.420
So I think that they made all this money in China.

284
00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:06.590
Where were they made these movies?

285
00:16:06.591 --> 00:16:10.070
Cause after that the producers are hit and we're running low on shore and

286
00:16:10.071 --> 00:16:12.580
Raymond Chow,
Raymond Shaft,
the Bruce Lee die.

287
00:16:12.581 --> 00:16:15.020
Raymond shot became a break partner wanting to brothers.
In fact,

288
00:16:15.021 --> 00:16:19.490
he produced a bunch of Charles Bronson movies.
Wow.

289
00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:21.620
You understand me?
So there was a lot of Kinky shit going on.

290
00:16:21.621 --> 00:16:24.700
And then 30 years later they killed his son.
If you watch godfather two,

291
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:27.530
what does he do?
He kills the fucking son's.
He lets veto live.

292
00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:32.090
Vito goes back to the United States,
gets Powell and comes back and tells the by,

293
00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.520
uh,
by bye.
Uh,

294
00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:38.780
turn the machine on to the top price.
They're not going to stink.

295
00:16:38.781 --> 00:16:41.450
Those are good for you.
Out of your foes are salmon flux,
bro.

296
00:16:41.451 --> 00:16:44.030
There's something wrong with your nose.
Go to a dog.
There's a salmon.

297
00:16:44.031 --> 00:16:46.880
I did a little him smelling,
therefore,
it's terrible art.

298
00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:49.880
So bear forest in your faith.
You don't have to turn it on.
Really just sit down.

299
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:53.520
Gotcha.
That's glued a call with some m four is protein in that mother fucker.

300
00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:55.460
Oh,

301
00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:56.563
<v 5>okay.</v>

302
00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:03.280
