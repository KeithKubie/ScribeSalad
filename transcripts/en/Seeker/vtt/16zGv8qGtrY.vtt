00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:02.940
‘Member that time I talked about stem cells?

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.100
Ohhh, I ‘member!

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.410
Hey cell mates, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.230
We’ve been cranking out episodes for four
years now.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.230
Can you believe it?

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.440
Over the course of the next few days, the
hosts from DNews are going to celebrate our

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.760
birthday by having a look back and revisiting
topics from our first days with the show.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.300
I have talked about a ton of fascinating stuff
but I still remember my first episode, when

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.040
a fresh-faced and over-enthusiastic me couldn’t
wait to tell you about an exciting new experimental

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.590
treatment involving stem cells, cells which
can take the form of other tissues and hold

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.739
the promise of regenerative medicine.

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.730
Since then, what’s been going on in the
world of stem cells?

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:42.870
Well, a lot.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.420
Like, a lot a lot.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.000
Hardly a week goes by without stem cells making
a headline for one thing or another.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.520
Here’s a brief sample of some from the last
two years.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.790
Scientists successfully created mouse eggs
from stem cells that produce healthy young

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.490
pups when fertilized.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.030
Stem cell therapies on people with traumatic
brain injuries appear to reduce the body’s

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.870
neuroinflammatory response, saving brain tissue.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.530
And cardiologists are testing stem cells as
a treatment for a type of heart failure that

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.780
kills half its victims within 5 years and
previously had no treatments at all.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.590
Oh, did I say those were headlines from the
last two years?

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.780
I meant the last two weeks.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.760
So obviously the pace and variety of stem
cell research is immense.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.400
Looking back to my first episode, though,
we focused on what was then a new treatment

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.980
for vision loss caused by macular degeneration;
that’s when part of your retina starts to

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:28.990
deteriorate.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.580
It wasn’t the first time stems cells had
been used to treat macular degeneration.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.590
In fact, a month after my DNews debut, a report
published in the Lancet followed up on 18

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.290
cases of patients who had stem cell procedures
on their eyes up to three years prior.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.130
The patients showed no signs of rejection
or tumor growth, and for 13 of them their

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.440
vision had improved on average about 3 lines
on the eye chart test.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.770
You know the one with the huge E and then
a bunch of smudges?

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.159
Anyway, the story I covered was special because
it was the first use of induced pluripotent

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.140
stem cells, or iPSCs, on a human.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.729
The cells were made from a patient’s own
skin that had been turned back into stem cells

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.340
using a virus that delivered new DNA.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.760
Before that, scientists used embryonic stem
cells which may have a risk of rejection to

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.129
go along with a thorny ethical dilemma.

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.439
Sadly, the woman who received the induced
stem cell treatment remains the only person

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:19.719
with that distinction.

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:23.659
The researchers had a second procedure planned,
but halted it when two small mutations in

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.799
the cells made them worry they would lead
to tumor growth.

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:31.030
That hasn’t been the end for iPSCs; in fact
they’ve become invaluable for laboratory

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.030
work.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.260
They’ve been useful for drug screenings
and scientists can study diseases by introducing

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.449
mutations to the cells using the breakthrough
gene editing technique CRISPR.

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:44.370
And because iPSCs are so similar to embryonic
stem cells but can be produced easily and

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.260
ethically, stem cells are in a much greater
supply than ever before.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.700
In fact, their creator, Shinya Yamanaka, isn’t
resting on his Nobel laurels.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.840
Using a protein called BMP, or Bone Morphogenetic
Protein

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.120
, he discovered a way to turn adult cells
into stem cells more frequently.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.419
This can increase the supply and further accelerate
and diversify the research.

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:08.999
So two years on, nobody else has received
treatment using induced pluripotent stem cells.

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:11.590
But that doesn’t mean there’s been no
progress.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.950
Scientists are finding new and interesting
uses for them all the time, but they’re

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.650
going slow and making sure the treatment won’t
do more harm than good.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.989
Like we always say, more research is needed.

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.839
We all having embarrassing pictures of us
when we were younger, but I’m not ashamed.

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:29.959
There is my first ever DNews episode right
there.

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:30.959
Epic flail!

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.529
Are there any other old DNews episodes that
stick out in your mind that you’d like us

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:35.650
to follow up on?

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.669
Go ahead tell us about them in the comments,
subscribe for more and we'll see you next

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:39.430
time on DNews.
