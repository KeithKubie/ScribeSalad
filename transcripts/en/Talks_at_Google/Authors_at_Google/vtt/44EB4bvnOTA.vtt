[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.870
SERGEY BRIN: A
special TGIF today.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.390
Of course, they're all special.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.750
But especially special
today because not only

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.090
do I have our distinguished
CEO, Eric, dressed

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.156
in a suit with a
tie and everything.

00:00:20.156 --> 00:00:22.566
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.590
But we also have
Tom Friedman dressed

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.840
in a tie and a suit and
the whole kit and caboodle.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.798
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.270
I assume Tom needs no
introduction, having been here

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.130
a number of times before.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.220
But we are very delighted
to have him here again,

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.680
now with his new book out.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.950
And I'm very anxious to
hear what he has to say.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.920
And Eric, take it away.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.430
ERIC SCHMIDT: So it
is a huge pleasure

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.825
to welcome you back to Google.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.470
The title of your book
is "The World is Flat,"

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.950
and that view kind of went out
of style maybe 500 years ago.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.650
But I want to make sure
first I want to give credit

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.710
to John Doerr and our friends
at Kleiner Perkins for including

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.815
you as part of this.

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:24.050
You're on the book
tour and in addition

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.360
to having this
very curious title,

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.340
in one week you're the
number one highly rated book

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.752
in the "New York Times
Book" magazine, right

00:01:33.752 --> 00:01:35.210
to the top of the
best-seller list.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.415
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:47.090
So I, of course, read
your column today

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.640
using the old technology.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.000
And the important thing
here about "The World

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.890
is Flat" is you figured it out.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.850
And when you came
to Google last time,

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.890
you were doing
research for this book.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.790
So tell us what
were the things that

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.310
caused you to do this analysis?

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.600
You said there were 10
things that came together

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.170
to prove something which has
been false for 500 years.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.830
THOMAS FRIEDMAN:
Well, it's a great way

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.030
to frame the question, Eric.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.420
And first of all, thank you
for having me here again, Eric.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.790
And Sergei, thank you
for the introduction.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.610
And John Doerr,
thank you for making

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.240
it possible in this crazy
day to get me back and forth.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.170
It's really a treat to be here.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.080
I am at the end of
a six-week book tour

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.256
and this is one of
my very last stops

00:02:39.256 --> 00:02:41.130
and I've been really
looking forward to this.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.940
I was trying to think back
to our last conversation,

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.210
and I believe I was
here almost a year ago.

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.930
It was in June.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.930
It was really before
I went on sabbatical.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.530
And let me just sort
of recap one thing

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.750
and then try to tell you
what kind of came together

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.770
after I was here in
terms of my own thinking.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.050
This book was
spawned, as I think

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.752
I talked a little bit last
time, quite by accident.

00:03:07.752 --> 00:03:09.710
I've been doing documentaries
for the Discovery

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:16.520
Channel for the last few years
and back in January of 2004,

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.990
we were trying to
figure out what

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:19.520
to do our next documentary on.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.960
We had done one on the wall
in Israel and the West Bank,

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.470
we had done one on
the roots of 9/11.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.540
And at that time, the issue
of why the world hates America

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.640
was sort of this big hot issue.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.740
And I had this
idea that we should

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.230
go to call centers
all over the world

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.960
and interview young people
who spend their days imitating

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.389
Americans on what they
thought of America.

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:43.430
And I thought it would be
a very interesting kind

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.830
of double image.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.200
And literally, we were
costing that trip out

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.830
when John Kerry came out with
his blast against Benedict

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.040
Arnold executives who outsource
and suddenly, outsourcing

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.260
became this super hot issue.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.080
And I decided with Discovery
that maybe we should just

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.224
go to Bangalore and do
a documentary called

00:04:02.224 --> 00:04:03.890
"The Other Side of
Outsourcing" and look

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.940
at this from the ground up.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.710
And we did about 60 hours of
interviews in the course of 10,

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:11.420
11 days there.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.330
And throughout those
interviews, I really

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.399
got progressively sicker and
sicker and it wasn't the food.

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:17.930
ERIC SCHMIDT: It
wasn't the food.

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.430
THOMAS FRIEDMAN:
It wasn't the food.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.860
It was somewhere between
the Indian entrepreneur who

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.260
wanted to do my taxes from
Bangalore and the one who

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.199
wanted to write my new
software from Bangalore

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.490
and the one who wanted to
read my x-rays from Bangalore

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.010
and the one who wanted to
trace my lost luggage on Delta

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.450
Airlines from Bangalore.

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.747
I began to realize that
while I had been sleeping,

00:04:35.747 --> 00:04:38.330
while I'd been off covering the
9/11 war, something really big

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.800
had happened in this
globalization story

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.380
and I had missed it.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.356
And the last interview we
did was with Nandan Nilekani,

00:04:46.356 --> 00:04:47.480
who is the head of Infosys.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.464
And actually, before
the interview started,

00:04:50.464 --> 00:04:52.880
we were sitting on the couch
outside his office and Nandan

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.250
really just mentioned
in passing--

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.140
not so much in passing,
talking about what

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.760
he was going to talk about--

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.280
he said, Tom, the global
economic playing field

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.420
is being leveled and you
Americans are not ready.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.490
Oh, I wrote that down
in my little notebook,

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.030
the global economic playing
field is being leveled.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.140
And the book really emerged
because on the bus ride back

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.590
from Infosys to
the hotel, I just

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.030
kept rolling that
over in my head,

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.488
the playing field
is being leveled.

00:05:22.488 --> 00:05:24.540
What Nandan is telling
me, I finally realized,

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.470
was that the playing
field was being flattened.

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.060
And then really
the brainstorm that

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.390
produced the book happened
on some pothole on the road

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:33.105
to my hotel.

00:05:33.105 --> 00:05:34.730
I suddenly realized
what he was telling

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.430
me was that the world was flat
and he was actually citing this

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.530
as a great achievement
in human development,

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.484
that we'd made the world flat.

00:05:42.484 --> 00:05:44.400
So I went back to the
hotel, I called my wife.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.816
I said, honey, I'm going to
write a book called "The World

00:05:46.816 --> 00:05:47.670
is Flat."

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.219
She thought I was
stark-raving mad.

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:53.510
But I came home and told the
publisher of the "New York

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.000
Times" and my
editor, Gail Collins,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.333
the editor of the editorial
page, I basically told them,

00:05:57.333 --> 00:05:59.820
I've got to go on
leave immediately

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.317
because my software,
the analytical framework

00:06:02.317 --> 00:06:03.900
through which I'm
looking at the world

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.750
and trying to understand
foreign affairs, is out of date

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.160
and I need to update it.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.260
And if I don't update
it immediately,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.630
I'm going to write
something really stupid

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.090
in the "New York Times."

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.840
It's a great way to get a
leave, I've got to tell you.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:19.700
You can't beat it.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.519
I mean, it's hard
to say no, right?

00:06:22.519 --> 00:06:24.060
So that's really
what I've been doing

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.310
and that's what really
brought me to Google last June

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:27.160
and whatnot.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.150
And you'll recall when I
was here last time, Eric,

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.370
that I talked to you
and to Larry and Sergei

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:36.180
about this idea of the
thing that really struck me

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.410
when I was in Bangalore--

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.600
because I had been off covering
the 9/11 wars all that time,

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.410
in fact one time came
here and talked about it--

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.740
that when I would sit across
the table from someone

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.350
like Jerry Rao, the head of
Nascom, the Indian high tech

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.590
association, I would sort
of end every interview

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:56.170
after the cameras went off by
saying, Jerry, what did I miss?

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:58.120
Something's happened.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.800
What did I miss?

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.510
And it was really in a quest
to answer that question.

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.260
Because people were
offering to do things.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.051
They were telling me
they were doing things

00:07:07.051 --> 00:07:09.730
that I really couldn't explain.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.397
And so the second
chapter of the book

00:07:11.397 --> 00:07:13.730
really is called "The 10 Days
that Flattened the World."

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:16.021
It's about the 10 forces and
events that came together.

00:07:16.021 --> 00:07:21.270
And I talked about that last
time, the different forces

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:26.150
that I thought created
this level playing field.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.910
But what I did after
I left here, Eric,

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:35.440
was in working on it more
thinking it through more,

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.150
I actually tied those 10
flatteners together into what I

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:40.900
think was more of a
conceptual framework--

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.106
it wasn't just 10 things--

00:07:43.106 --> 00:07:44.980
and maybe I'll go through
them really quickly

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:46.370
and try to explain what I mean.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:47.140
ERIC SCHMIDT: You
don't think it's just

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.264
broadband and the internet?

00:07:48.264 --> 00:07:52.480
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: It's not just
broadband and the internet, no.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.490
The 10 flatteners for
me were first 11/9;

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:58.414
11/9 is the day the Berlin
Wall came down, 11/9/89.

00:07:58.414 --> 00:08:00.080
That hugely important
because it allowed

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.900
us to look at the world
as a single flat plane.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.850
And the first
flattener is called

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.310
"When the Walls Came down
and the Windows Came Up,"

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:10.040
because the Windows operating
system shipped five months

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.810
after the fall of
the Berlin Wall.

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:14.540
So the two things
happened at the same time.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.940
We got to see the world
as a single flat plane--

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:17.630
ERIC SCHMIDT: And
one still crashes.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:18.850
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: And
one still crashes.

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:20.660
No, I didn't say
that; he said that.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.130
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:29.160
ERIC SCHMIDT: We use more
reliable [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:29.860
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Very good.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:30.500
So good.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.940
The second flattener
was 8/9/95, and that was

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.840
the day Netscape went public.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.240
And I argue that Netscape
went public helped, obviously,

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.352
bring the internet alive,
gave us open standards

00:08:44.352 --> 00:08:46.310
to make sure no company
dominated the internet,

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:48.705
and thirdly triggered
the dotcom boom,

00:08:48.705 --> 00:08:50.330
which triggered the
dotco bubble, which

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.080
triggered the accidental
investment in all

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.040
this fiberoptic cable.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.110
The third flattener I
simply call workflow,

00:08:57.110 --> 00:09:00.080
and that was all the stuff and
standards, all the software

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.300
that basically connected
all that bandwidth with all

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.300
those PCs and the idea
that over the 1990s,

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.910
a kind of quiet revolution
happened in workflow that

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:10.520
allowed everyone's application
to connect everyone else's

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.080
application.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.929
So when I left
here, basically, I

00:09:13.929 --> 00:09:16.220
realized that actually, these
first three were actually

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.830
the genesis moment
of the flat world.

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:22.430
Because once you had an
internet that came alive,

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:24.500
I would argue thanks
to the browser,

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.830
suddenly you had people able to
connect with people like never

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:30.560
before and more
cheaply than ever,

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.580
thanks to all that
fiberoptic cable.

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:35.280
Once you had applications
that were made interoperable

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.110
with other
applications, it meant

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:40.050
people could work together on
more different stuff than ever

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:41.209
before.

00:09:41.209 --> 00:09:43.500
And when you put the two
together, what you really got,

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.583
I think, was the genesis
moment of the flat world,

00:09:45.583 --> 00:09:49.399
that is when we could
connect with each other

00:09:49.399 --> 00:09:50.940
and when we could
work together, what

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:55.020
we created was a global
platform for multiple forms

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.670
of collaboration.

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:59.520
Suddenly, more people could
collaborate on more stuff

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.140
than ever before.

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.420
Well, then I thought about
my next six flatteners,

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.160
which when I was here were
just sort of six things.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.125
And what I realized
what these were

00:10:08.125 --> 00:10:11.370
were the six new
forms of collaboration

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.380
that sprung from this platform.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.365
So they are, very quickly,
outsourcing-- well,

00:10:15.365 --> 00:10:18.330
outsourcing is just a new
form of collaboration.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.570
The second is offshoring.

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:23.520
Outsourcing is I take
my finance department

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.141
and move it to north Palo
Alto, North Dakota, or north

00:10:26.141 --> 00:10:26.640
Bangalore.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.820
Off this new platform,
either one is equally easy.

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:31.890
Offshoring is where I
take my whole factory

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:36.000
and move it from Canton,
Ohio to Canton, China.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.980
The third one is open sourcing.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:41.610
I realized open sourcing is
just a new form of collaboration

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:46.507
now for making everything from
free software to Wikipedia.

00:10:46.507 --> 00:10:48.090
The fourth new form
of collaboration I

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:49.724
call supply chaining.

00:10:49.724 --> 00:10:51.390
When I was here I
talked about Wal-Mart,

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:54.810
but Wal-Mart is just a metaphor
for a new form of collaboration

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:56.280
where you take
supply chaining down

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.672
to the last atom of efficiency.

00:10:58.672 --> 00:11:00.630
So an item is taken off
the shelf in a Wal-Mart

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.421
in San Francisco and
another is immediately

00:11:02.421 --> 00:11:03.911
made in Shenzhen, China.

00:11:03.911 --> 00:11:05.410
If Wal-Mart were a
country, today it

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:07.368
would be China's eighth
largest trading partner

00:11:07.368 --> 00:11:11.720
after Canada and Australia.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:17.001
So Yossi Sheffi, who does
supply chain logistics at MIT,

00:11:17.001 --> 00:11:17.750
has a nice saying.

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:21.070
He says, making
stuff, that's easy;

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:23.651
supply chain,
that's really hard.

00:11:23.651 --> 00:11:25.900
And when you think about it,
it's kind of interesting.

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.899
Wal-Mart is the biggest
company in America today

00:11:27.899 --> 00:11:30.490
that doesn't make a thing,
other than supply chain.

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:33.760
So supply changing, new
form of collaboration.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.680
The fifth new form
of collaboration I

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:36.580
call insourcing.

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.282
That's what UPS does.

00:11:38.282 --> 00:11:40.240
They come inside your
company now and take over

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.460
your whole internal logistics.

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:44.710
As I came to study
more about UPS,

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:46.240
I came to realize
that the people

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.610
in the funny brown trucks
and the funny brown shirts

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:52.390
and shorts were not just
delivering packages,

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:54.010
they're doing
internal logistics.

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:55.926
And the example I give
in the book, of course,

00:11:55.926 --> 00:11:57.040
is Toshiba laptop.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.217
Your Toshiba breaks,
you call Toshiba,

00:11:59.217 --> 00:12:01.300
they say bring it to the
UPS Store, ship it to us,

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.136
we'll fix it in 72
hours and send it back.

00:12:03.136 --> 00:12:04.510
Of course, what
you don't know is

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:07.270
it goes from the UPS
Store to the UPS hub

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:08.860
at Louisville
Airport in Kentucky,

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:11.260
where in a clean room
in a hangar airline

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.200
hangar at Louisville Airport,
your Toshiba laptop is

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.720
repaired by a UPS
employee and it never

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.784
touches Toshiba's hands.

00:12:18.784 --> 00:12:20.950
And this is true now for a
lot of things, everything

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:23.620
from Nike.com to
Papa John's pizzas,

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:26.200
their trucks are actually
driven by UPS employees.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.554
So in-sourcing, a new
form of collaboration.

00:12:28.554 --> 00:12:30.220
And this is going to
be very interesting

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.450
because this is going to
drive a lot of standards.

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:34.450
Because as you take this
down from big companies

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:37.010
to want to do it to little
companies, for little companies

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:39.820
you're going to require lots
of standards, huge flattener.

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:44.350
And the sixth and last form
of collaboration was Google.

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:46.360
And at the time, I just
said, it was Google.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:49.210
But I realized that what you
do is a form of collaboration

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:51.340
I call informing.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.200
Because I can now inform myself.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:57.200
I could collaborate
with data all by myself.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.670
So to me Google, TiVo are
new forms of collaboration.

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:02.470
I can inform myself
on entertainment,

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:04.570
I can inform myself
on information.

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:07.120
I wrote this book without
a research assistant.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.280
My researcher was Google.

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:13.150
I wrote my first book, I
wrote "Beirut to Jerusalem,"

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:15.550
I had a physical researcher
who sat next to me.

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:18.888
He brought me physical paper,
I handed him physical money.

00:13:18.888 --> 00:13:21.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.940
I wrote this book
entirely with Google

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:26.530
as my research assistant.

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:28.960
And I found it was not
only more efficient,

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.330
but actually I
discovered and stumbled

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:35.410
over so many things I never
would have found had I not

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:38.170
been informing myself.

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:40.660
So now we have the first three,
they created this platform

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:42.100
for collaboration.

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:46.600
With the next six, I realized
the new forms of collaboration

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.580
that have sprung
off this platform

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:50.380
and flattened the
world even more.

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:52.870
Well, that's nine and I said
there were 10 when I was here.

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:54.578
So I scratched my
head, what is the 10th?

00:13:54.578 --> 00:13:56.710
And when I was here, I
talked about wireless.

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:58.930
But I realized the
10th flattener was now

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:01.120
what I call the steroids.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.760
And the steroids are
wireless, voice over IP,

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:04.990
and file sharing--

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:07.060
Napster, BitTorrent,
things like that.

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:11.350
And what these steroids are
doing are turbocharging all six

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:13.490
of these new forms
of collaboration

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:16.480
so I can now do any
one from anywhere

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.767
with any device totally mobile.

00:14:18.767 --> 00:14:21.100
ERIC SCHMIDT: Were you the
chief technical correspondent

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:22.900
or the chief foreign
correspondent?

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:23.380
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: No.

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:24.930
ERIC SCHMIDT: It's amazing
what you turned out.

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:26.679
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: I
just figured it all out

00:14:26.679 --> 00:14:28.180
after basically I was here.

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:31.570
ERIC SCHMIDT: But
this book is probably

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:34.810
the defining book in this age
of how this platform is going

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:37.630
to work because a lot of people
are very worried about what

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:38.860
your book says.

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:41.860
For example, it's
been observed that we

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:44.350
have inflationary spending
in the United States, deficit

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:46.016
spending, so forth
and so on, yet prices

00:14:46.016 --> 00:14:50.210
are not going up because of the
deflationary nature of China--

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:52.940
a new force, something people
haven't really thought through.

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:56.317
If we extend your ideas, that's
going to be endemic, right?

00:14:56.317 --> 00:14:58.400
Because one of the things
that happens now is it's

00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.930
a global market.

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:03.590
Who are the people who are
most negatively affected?

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:05.870
Google is an example of a
company possibly affected

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:08.450
by these enormous
things you've unearthed.

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:10.520
Who are the people who
are most threatened?

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:11.630
How will they react?

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:13.400
How does this play out?

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.549
What's the map for the
next five or 10 years?

00:15:15.549 --> 00:15:17.840
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Well, I
think there's reason to worry.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.620
And that's why
the point I made--

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:23.750
Eric and both spoke this
morning at the [INAUDIBLE] Econ

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:24.802
Conference--

00:15:24.802 --> 00:15:27.260
one of the points I made to
them and I made to the Business

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.750
Roundtable this
week is that I think

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.820
business and
businesses like Google

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:36.360
are going to have to be more
outspoken about defending

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:39.750
both the challenges and the
opportunities of this world

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:42.690
because I think all the
political incentives are going

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:43.710
to be the other way.

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:46.800
And I really smell
that in Washington.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:50.220
Now, what I what
I tried to argue

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:52.620
in thinking through
your question, Eric,

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:58.280
is that I have a chapter in the
book called "The Untouchables,"

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:01.070
and the argument is that
when the world goes flat,

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:03.920
the global caste system
gets turned upside down.

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.620
The highest caste
become the untouchables.

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:10.070
Untouchables are people whose
jobs cannot be outsourced.

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:11.050
OK.

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:13.614
Now, who would be an
untouchable in this world?

00:16:13.614 --> 00:16:16.030
Well, I would argue there are
going to be four categories.

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:18.360
First are people who
are really special--

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.802
Michael Jordan,
Barbra Streisand--

00:16:19.802 --> 00:16:21.760
they can't be outsourced,
you know what I mean?

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:24.090
These are people--

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:27.330
Eric Schmidt, Sergei Brin, Larry
Page, they can't be outsourced.

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:30.150
OK.

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:33.000
Second are people who
are really specialized,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.340
I'm sure 95% of the
people in this room--

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:37.530
people who really
have a specialized

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:41.280
skill that is not fungible.

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:44.865
And third are people
who are really anchored,

00:16:44.865 --> 00:16:46.740
and that's going to
apply to a lot of people.

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:49.320
That's everything from
your doctor to your nurse

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:53.400
to your barber to the chef to
all kinds of people whose jobs

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.530
have to be done in
a specific location,

00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:57.360
no matter how flat
the world gets.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.800
But the fourth,
and this really I

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:02.020
think is what's going
to apply to 90% of us,

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:07.079
is going to be people who know
how to learn how to learn,

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:09.150
people who are really adaptable.

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:10.770
Because it seems
to me what's going

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:12.450
to happen as the
world goes flat,

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:14.250
and as I watch
Google I think it's

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:16.464
a perfect manifestation
of this, we're

00:17:16.464 --> 00:17:18.839
connecting all the knowledge
pools in the world together.

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:20.010
That's what it really means.

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:21.480
We're connecting the
knowledge pools in India,

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.521
the knowledge pools in
China, the knowledge pools

00:17:23.521 --> 00:17:26.250
in Palo Alto more
intimately than ever before.

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:28.050
I think as a result,
we're on the cusp

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:32.310
of an era of innovation
that's going to be remarkable.

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:34.710
I interviewed somebody
in the last week

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:38.260
and they told me Motorola is
developing a cell phone that

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.140
will be sold for $12.

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:42.960
And so all I could think
of is, when the $12 cell

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.450
phone, the internet-enabled
cell phone,

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:48.170
meets Google, that means
there's a lot of people in India

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:49.920
and China that are
going be walking around

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.290
with all the world's
knowledge in their pocket.

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:54.000
And I believe
that's going to lead

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.960
to an explosion of innovation.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.710
The next great
breakthrough in bio science

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:00.376
could come from a
15-year-old in Romania

00:18:00.376 --> 00:18:02.560
who downloads the human genome.

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:05.070
So what the result
of that is I think

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:07.370
we're going to see creative
destruction on steroids.

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:08.610
ERIC SCHMIDT: Well, in
fact, in your column,

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:10.320
you point out in
the ACM programming

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.970
contest, the winners--

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:14.460
Shanghai, Beijing,
all over the world.

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:17.090
THOMAS FRIEDMAN:
We came in 17th.

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:19.030
So just to finish
this point, Eric,

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:22.340
is that I think that
the really skill you

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.026
need to be safe in
this world is you've

00:18:25.026 --> 00:18:26.150
got to be really adaptable.

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:28.580
You've got to be able
to learn how to learn.

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:31.670
And I'm an example of this.

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:33.380
I had to retool myself.

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:36.980
I mean, I've just spent the last
year completely re-engineering

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:40.890
my skills because I went out
in the world and I discovered,

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:43.160
look, you can't write about
the West Bank and Bosnia

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.600
every week.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:48.020
I mean, know everyone else does,
but I mean, I don't want to.

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:50.870
And so if you want to be
relevant in explaining

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:53.422
the world, I had to
answer the questions

00:18:53.422 --> 00:18:54.380
that I couldn't answer.

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:56.430
So I had to upgrade my skills.

00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:59.530
And I think we
all are going to--

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:01.280
the future belongs to
those who are really

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:03.501
good at learning how to learn.

00:19:03.501 --> 00:19:05.000
And I think that's
really the skill.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.270
ERIC SCHMIDT: I want to
ask one more question,

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:08.300
then I'd like to encourage
audience questions,

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:10.549
which I think are always
more interesting than my own.

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:15.130
In the last 15 years,
you have really

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:18.260
defined the analysis and
coverage of the Middle East

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:22.820
in many actions and
made your mark there.

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:27.550
You've now seen the world
with a flat perspective

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:31.010
and I don't personally
see the impact

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:35.050
from this message on your
former area of expertise,

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:37.760
current area, and perhaps
you'll go back to that.

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:41.180
I don't see the
changes happening yet

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:44.870
in that part of the
world from you thesis.

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:47.550
I 100% agree with your thesis.

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:48.530
So what's wrong?

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:52.790
Is it just time,
is it investment?

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:55.820
I think it's all positive
for the Middle East.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.800
Everything you say
should ultimately

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.680
result in a more
stable, better informed,

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:01.871
better educated outcome.

00:20:01.871 --> 00:20:04.245
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Well, that's
a very good question, Eric.

00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:06.440
And I'd give you three ways,
and they're not all positive,

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.780
where the flat world is at
work in that part of the world.

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:09.620
ERIC SCHMIDT: Does not work?

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:10.953
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: No, is at work.

00:20:10.953 --> 00:20:12.749
But they're not always positive.

00:20:12.749 --> 00:20:14.540
One of the points I
try to make in the book

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:15.748
is that when the world goes--

00:20:15.748 --> 00:20:19.710
the flat world is a friend
of Infosys and of al-Qaeda.

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:20.210
OK?

00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:22.360
And to me, al-Qaeda--

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.580
and what I've done is
basically take my analysis now,

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:26.350
reapply it to the Middle East.

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:29.000
And so when I do that, what I
see when I look at al-Qaeda,

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.520
I see nothing more than an open
source global supply chain.

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:36.820
The person who understood
supply chains better or as well

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:39.580
as Sam Walton was
Osama bin Laden.

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:41.200
And al-Qaeda today
is nothing more

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:45.780
than a global open-source
suicide supply chain.

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:47.850
You deploy a suicide
bomber in Tikrit

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:51.240
and another is immediately
recruited and deployed

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.387
down the supply chain
from somewhere else

00:20:53.387 --> 00:20:54.220
in the Muslim world.

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:55.320
So that's one way.

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.750
In fact, one of the points
that I've been arguing--

00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:59.400
and I haven't been
able to develop this

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.150
because I don't have
enough raw material--

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:03.262
is I think we're up
against something

00:21:03.262 --> 00:21:04.720
in Iraq that we
just don't know how

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:07.410
to deal with, that we're
still thinking vertically,

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:09.940
command and control, when
our enemy is thinking

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:11.530
connect and collaborate.

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:13.750
We're approaching it
vertically, what is basically

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:15.490
a horizontal enemy.

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:20.560
And I think we're dealing, as
I say, with a kind of suicide

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.490
supply chain and we've never
faced anything like this

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:23.990
before.

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:26.950
It's a very flat organization
and we don't quite

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:28.790
know how to get
our arms around it.

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:31.960
So that's kind of one area where
I'd say the flat world applies.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.840
Another area, and this
is to the negative,

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:35.840
is when the world goes--

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.298
ERIC SCHMIDT: The
first one wasn't?

00:21:37.298 --> 00:21:39.880
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Yeah, this
is even more to the negative.

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:42.460
When the world goes flat,
you get your humiliation

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:44.500
fiber-optically.

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:45.220
OK?

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:48.080
You get your humiliation at 56k.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.680
And because you can see
just where the caravan is

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.820
and just how far behind you are.

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:55.660
And if you believe, as I do,
that what is really behind 9/11

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:59.680
is humiliation, a deep sense
of a proud civilization

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:02.950
having fallen behind, the
flattening of the world

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:07.560
intensifies that enormously.

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.280
But on the up
side, I don't think

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.635
you have the cedar
revolution in Lebanon

00:22:11.635 --> 00:22:13.135
without the flattening
of the world.

00:22:13.135 --> 00:22:14.530
The Lebanese were
sitting there, they

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:17.155
watched exactly what happened in
Georgia, exactly what happened

00:22:17.155 --> 00:22:18.760
in Ukraine, and
said, wait a minute,

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:21.340
if these guys can do
that, why can't we?

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.080
And in talking to
Lebanese friends,

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:24.250
they made that very clear.

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:27.330
They were watching all of
this play out on satellite.

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:29.855
Now, the tragic
accident of Hariri

00:22:29.855 --> 00:22:31.480
being killed, the
prime minister, which

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:34.037
triggered all this that
obviously was necessary,

00:22:34.037 --> 00:22:36.370
but the flattening of the
world was the sufficient thing

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:38.020
to make it possible.

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:40.460
That part of the world,
what keeps that resistant,

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:45.260
I would say, is oil,
is the curse of oil.

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:49.920
And so it allows you to
build certain barriers

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:53.936
for a time against these
pressures of globalization.

00:22:53.936 --> 00:22:55.810
And right now because
of the windfall in oil,

00:22:55.810 --> 00:23:01.490
they've really been able to
keep the dam up, basically.

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:04.120
But I think it's only
a matter of time,

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:06.975
the flattening is
and will come there.

00:23:06.975 --> 00:23:09.100
The Berlin Wall is falling
in the Arab Muslim world

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:11.680
today, that's the good news.

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:14.650
The uncertain news is
that Vaclav Havel is not

00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:15.930
on the other side.

00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:16.660
OK?

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:19.120
And neither is Lech Welesa,
neither is the solidarity trade

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:19.720
movement.

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:21.410
That's not a bad thing.

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:23.440
I mean that only
to say that they

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.380
have a very different attitude
toward the West, a very

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:29.620
different set of political
actors, a much more

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:31.330
complex society.

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:34.720
It isn't a group of people just
dying to jump into our arms,

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.270
as we had in Eastern Europe
and the Soviet Union.

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:40.390
And so when the flattening comes
there and the wall comes down,

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:43.230
it isn't so they can be
pro-American or pro-Western.

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:44.830
They're going to
make their own way,

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:46.600
they're going to
shape their own thing.

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:51.190
I'm still net positive
about it, but it's going

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:52.900
to be really, really complex.

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.300
It's going to be one of
the great dramas, I think,

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:58.190
to watch on the world
stage, how this plays out.

00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:00.591
ERIC SCHMIDT: Let's get some
questions from our audience.

00:24:00.591 --> 00:24:01.590
Who would like to begin?

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.110
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
earlier that one

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:12.040
of the major losers in
this would be politicians

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.680
and that there would be
resistance from that.

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:20.500
Could you elaborate
and possibly discuss

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:23.920
what we either individually
or corporately can

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:27.220
do to ease their minds?

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:31.330
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: The
question is really where are

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:33.070
kind of politicians
going to go with this

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:37.690
and what can any individual
or company do to tilt it

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:39.072
in the right direction?

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:44.420
I don't say this to be cute, I
say this to tell you something

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:46.545
that I only realized when
I got done with the book.

00:24:46.545 --> 00:24:51.930
I wrote a 488-page book about
the next phase of globalization

00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:57.080
and I didn't interview
anyone in the US government

00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:00.230
and I live in Washington, DC.

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:03.180
I mean, I had an accidental
conversation with Colin Powell

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:04.740
that's in the book.

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:07.020
I needed some reference
so I talked to a librarian

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:09.090
at the National
Science Foundation.

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:12.240
But I don't think either
of those really count.

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:16.500
And so I went for wisdom
and insight somewhere else.

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.810
I'm sure there are people
in the government who

00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:22.680
could have helped,
but this is just not

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:25.590
really on the agenda
of Washington, DC.

00:25:28.802 --> 00:25:30.260
The argument I'm
making in the book

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:34.310
is that we're going from
vertical to horizontal in terms

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:36.530
of how value will be created.

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:39.290
My guess is over
time, this is going

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:42.730
to be the mother of
all inflection points.

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:44.300
This is going to
change everything.

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:46.450
I think it's going
to be Google's just

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:49.090
part of this manifestation.

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:51.490
This process is going
to be bigger or as big

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:55.960
as Gutenberg and the printing
press when it's done.

00:25:55.960 --> 00:26:01.460
And just when we've
reached this point,

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:03.014
nobody's talking about it.

00:26:03.014 --> 00:26:05.680
Doing this book was a little bit
like being in a science fiction

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:06.670
movie.

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:09.070
And I go around and
interview people

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:12.130
you know like Eric or
Sergei and Larry here,

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:15.010
people at Microsoft,
people at Intel, John Doerr

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:16.100
and his friends.

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:19.970
But talking to you all is
like talking to pod people.

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:23.440
You're like pod people in
a science fiction movie.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:25.780
You know the secret
and you're all

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:29.506
doing it like crazy, thank god.

00:26:29.506 --> 00:26:33.050
But nobody's told the kids.

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:35.690
Nobody's told the kids.

00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:38.450
So we just had an election
where Democrats were debating

00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:42.200
whether NAFTA was a good
idea and the Republicans

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:45.110
put duct tape over the mouth
of Chief White House Economist

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:46.820
Greg Mankiw when
he said outsourcing

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:54.050
made sense and stashed him
in Dick Cheney's basement

00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:57.950
never to be heard from again.

00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:00.620
So right at the moment when
we've reached, I think,

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:03.200
a really important
inflection point,

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.366
no one's talking about it.

00:27:05.366 --> 00:27:06.740
And I think first
of all, there's

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:11.300
just a huge education
responsibility, an opportunity

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.190
here, what world
we're living in--

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:15.680
what are the challenges and
what are the opportunities.

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.037
Now, my guess is--

00:27:17.037 --> 00:27:19.370
being on a book tour is a
really interesting experiences

00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:22.010
because you get to talk
to a lot of normal people,

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:24.135
basically, outside
of Washington, DC.

00:27:24.135 --> 00:27:26.510
And I would tell you if you
said, Tom, what did you learn

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:28.230
and six weeks of
book tour, I would

00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:31.820
tell you I learned there's
a huge undertow of concern

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:36.260
out there by parents
about education.

00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:39.260
They sense something's
going on out there

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:41.870
that their kids and that
the political system

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:44.526
is not discussing and
preparing them for.

00:27:44.526 --> 00:27:46.400
They're really, I think,
worried and confused

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:49.700
about it and no
politician yet that I see,

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:53.000
Democrat or Republican,
has seized this

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.240
and tried to define a
political agenda about it.

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:59.256
Nobody can be in Congress
at 12:00 midnight

00:27:59.256 --> 00:28:01.130
to discuss the fact that
the National Science

00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:05.480
Foundation cut its budget
by $100 million last year.

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:09.470
And so your last point
is the one I worry about.

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:13.054
Probably we're in a quiet
crisis right now, I would argue.

00:28:13.054 --> 00:28:15.470
It's not going to change our
standard of living overnight,

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:17.010
tomorrow, the next day.

00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:19.400
But if we don't begin to
adapt, I think it will.

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:22.340
And as my friend,
Paul Romer, says,

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:26.390
a crisis is a terrible
thing to waste.

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:27.590
ERIC SCHMIDT: Go ahead.

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:31.490
AUDIENCE: Funny enough, the
point I wanted to ask about

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:34.970
has also to do with
political backlash.

00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:42.110
It's not about a country we
would expect intense austerity

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:48.320
from, but the president of the
major governing political party

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:51.260
of Germany has come
out and defined

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:54.970
the international investing
community as locusts,

00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:58.670
eating all day,
they find their way.

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:01.430
So reflecting on
that, I don't really

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:04.730
see a connection between
the flattening that

00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:09.050
is terrifying German
politicians and the kind

00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:11.570
of technological
and social issues

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:15.590
you mentioned so much as to
financial issues, the fact

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:19.231
that capital is roaming the
Earth, whether for good or for

00:29:19.231 --> 00:29:19.730
ill.

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:24.165
Do you have any
reflections on that?

00:29:24.165 --> 00:29:25.540
THOMAS FRIEDMAN:
A good question.

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:26.789
I would simply say two things.

00:29:26.789 --> 00:29:29.570
One is the last documentary
we just did was about Europe

00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:34.490
and got a chance to look at
that very, very close hand.

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:40.970
I think Europe's in for just a
tremendous tsunami, basically,

00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:42.200
from this flattening process.

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:49.730
Compared to the social
benefits they had

00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:52.220
and what they're likely to
have to give up in order

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:56.170
to realign themselves
with this world,

00:29:56.170 --> 00:29:58.010
I think it's going to
politically enormously

00:29:58.010 --> 00:29:58.950
destabilizing.

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.980
You said something
and I'm just, sorry,

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:08.920
blanking out for a second
on what the other point I

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:09.730
wanted to make.

00:30:12.972 --> 00:30:14.180
I'll think of it in a second.

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:14.680
I'm sorry.

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.450
But that's sort of
my broad reaction

00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:20.770
is that they're basically not
having this discussion at all

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:21.270
over there.

00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:23.680
I can see it in the
contrast between the reviews

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:26.950
of the book here and the
reviews of the book there.

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:30.634
And my record on writing books
on globalization is intact.

00:30:30.634 --> 00:30:32.050
"The Lexus and the
Olive Tree" was

00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:38.860
translated into 29 languages,
all except one, French.

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:42.250
And so my record is intact.

00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:45.400
And so far we don't-- and I
offered to give it away for $1

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.710
to any French
publisher wanted it.

00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:51.400
So I think that
they still really

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:53.450
have not gotten their
mind around this story yet

00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:55.930
and I think it's going to
be politically very, very

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:56.600
destabilizing.

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:57.220
ERIC SCHMIDT: They
had that problem

00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:58.225
with Christopher Columbus.

00:30:58.225 --> 00:30:59.950
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: They had that
problem with Columbus, too--

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:01.240
exactly right.

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:03.610
ERIC SCHMIDT: Go ahead.

00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:06.190
AUDIENCE: I like what you
said about there being

00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:10.430
only a small group of people
whose jobs can't be outsourced

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:11.844
and I tend to agree with that.

00:31:11.844 --> 00:31:13.510
I was wondering if
you'd thought further

00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:15.190
about what's the
distribution going

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:19.460
to be like of people who
in these different groups,

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:22.060
meaning where's the
middle class going to go?

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:24.400
Are we just going to
divide up into people

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:28.110
who are in the top
caste and everyone else,

00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:30.759
and there's going to be
a big gap in the middle?

00:31:30.759 --> 00:31:32.800
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: It's an
important question, too.

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.560
And let me just
say I don't know.

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:39.800
I really tried not to
write a book of futurology

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.800
because there's a lot of
those books out there--

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.770
in five years, you'll be
able to talk to your shoe

00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:46.780
and it'll turn the
oven on at home

00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:49.310
and there will be
no middle class.

00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:52.060
And I really tried to
write a book by saying,

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:53.980
here's the world
as I see it, here's

00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:55.237
how I'm trying to explain it.

00:31:55.237 --> 00:31:57.070
So part of my answer
to you is I don't know.

00:31:57.070 --> 00:32:00.260
I spend so much from just
trying to figure it out.

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:03.370
But what I would
say my gut tells

00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:05.355
me is that people are
missing on the upside,

00:32:05.355 --> 00:32:07.480
is that two things happen
when the world goes flat.

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:10.460
One is the global
economy gets bigger.

00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:13.065
Well, that's great if you're
in the ideas business,

00:32:13.065 --> 00:32:14.440
you're in the
knowledge business.

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.330
Whether you're in the Google
business or the Microsoft

00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:18.220
business or the "New
York Times" business,

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:22.300
the market is going to
grow much bigger, OK?

00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:24.010
And it's also, I think,
what people miss,

00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:26.500
going to grow more complex.

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:28.420
And I would take an
example I've often

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:31.030
used that John taught me
this from your own industry.

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:33.950
I mean, 10 years ago there
was no Google, all right?

00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:36.736
And suddenly now,
this is considered

00:32:36.736 --> 00:32:38.860
you know one of the hottest,
most dynamic companies

00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:40.030
in the country.

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:41.590
Then someone comes
along and realized

00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:45.070
that, jeez, if Tom Friedman's
suitcase company comes up

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:49.000
on Google ahead of Samsonite,
there's real dollars in that.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.180
So suddenly, you get an industry
of search engine optimizers

00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:54.440
cropping up all around you.

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:57.070
And it seems to
me that basically,

00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:59.230
if you have knowledge
skills, if you

00:32:59.230 --> 00:33:01.240
are what I would call
a knowledge person,

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:03.550
the worst that'll happen to
you in a flat world is you

00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:06.100
will have to move horizontally.

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:06.880
OK?

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.520
That is maybe China
will in 10 years

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:11.230
specialize in things
that Google does

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:14.230
today that are commodities
and people here

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:16.030
will move horizontally
into something else.

00:33:16.030 --> 00:33:18.470
I am convinced if you
have the knowledge skills,

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:20.255
there is going to
be a place for you.

00:33:20.255 --> 00:33:21.880
If you don't have
the knowledge skills,

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:23.890
you're going to have
to move vertically.

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:27.430
You're going to have to move
from the non-knowledge world

00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:28.682
into the knowledge world.

00:33:28.682 --> 00:33:30.640
Now, when that happens,
two good things happen.

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:34.480
One, you get more people able
to access these kind of jobs

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:38.810
and secondly, you shrink the
pool of non-knowledge workers.

00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:42.550
And when you do that, the
price that plumbers can charge

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:45.280
goes from $75 to $100 an hour.

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:46.360
So you actually benefit.

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:48.820
As we all know, look
for either child care

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:50.980
or a plumber or a carpenter.

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:55.900
You want to shrink those jobs,
as well, so their wages come up

00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:57.220
at the same time.

00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:01.060
So the thing I always
tell myself is look,

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:03.400
after World War II,
we stood astride

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:05.290
the world totally dominant.

00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:07.630
We had the only industrial
economy standing.

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:10.000
Japan was decimated and
Europe was decimated.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.139
What did we do?

00:34:11.139 --> 00:34:12.790
We did the Marshall Plan.

00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:16.810
We built both of these countries
up into huge competitors.

00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:18.310
And what happened?

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:21.719
Our standard of living grew
for six straight decades.

00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:25.270
It's because the global economy
grows and it gets more complex.

00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:27.850
But it's very hard
to see, and therefore

00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:30.310
as it gets more complex,
new industries, new jobs

00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:31.000
get spun off.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.976
As long as you have knowledge
skills, you'll get one of them.

00:34:33.976 --> 00:34:36.100
And that's why I think the
biggest challenge for us

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:39.130
is look, 100 years
ago, 90% of Americans

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:41.560
worked in agriculture,
today 2% do.

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:44.106
Well, if we'd all been
watching Lou Dobbs back then,

00:34:44.106 --> 00:34:45.730
imagine what Lou
Dobbs' show would have

00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:50.010
sounded like in about 1850.

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:52.750
You mean you're
introducing a thresher?

00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:53.770
What do you mean?

00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:57.112
Benedict Arnold, you're
introducing a combine?

00:34:57.112 --> 00:34:59.570
Do you know what this is going
to do to people on the farm?

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:02.440
Do you know many jobs you're
going to lose on the farm?

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:05.770
Well, fortunately, Lou
Dobbs wasn't around in 1850,

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:07.840
but some other people
were who started

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:11.680
the high school movement and
the land grant universities.

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:13.180
I was looking this
up the other day.

00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:17.570
Do you know when we started
our land great universities?

00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:19.950
1862.

00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:23.340
Remember what was also
happening in 1862?

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:25.650
There was a little bit
of a war going on here,

00:35:25.650 --> 00:35:27.150
OK, in our own country.

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:31.500
In the middle of the
Civil War, Abraham Lincoln

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:35.554
had the wisdom to start the
land grant universities.

00:35:35.554 --> 00:35:37.970
And it was thanks to the high
school movement and the land

00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:40.670
grant universities we took all
those people from the farms

00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:42.161
into the industrial age.

00:35:42.161 --> 00:35:44.660
Now we're going to have to take
people in the industrial age

00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:46.460
into the post-industrial age.

00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:49.080
And you do that not with
secondary education,

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:51.940
but with post-secondary
education--

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:54.280
community college, technical
school, university.

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:58.450
And I think that the thing we
should be talking about today

00:35:58.450 --> 00:36:02.540
is not taking apart the New Deal
by privatizing social security.

00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:06.130
We need a new New Deal
around tertiary education.

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:07.970
That's the biggest thing.

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:11.550
Let's not worry about the safety
net-- or let's get that right--

00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:14.290
but let's focus on the
income opportunity,

00:36:14.290 --> 00:36:15.400
not this side of it.

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:22.790
AUDIENCE: Speaking of supply
chain companies like Wal-Mart,

00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:26.120
do you think their labor
and externalization

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:29.000
of cost policies are intrinsic
to being a supply chain

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.300
company or just part of
their corporate culture?

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:34.610
THOMAS FRIEDMAN:
Interesting question.

00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:37.070
I spent a lot of time with
Wal-Mart doing this book

00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:39.740
and that was an
interesting experience.

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:41.990
And you really do have to
go to Bentonville, Arkansas

00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:44.510
to understand Wal-Mart.

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:48.779
And what I learned when
I went to Bentonville,

00:36:48.779 --> 00:36:51.195
it all became clear to me, on
the upside and the downside.

00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:58.590
The really first thing that
strikes you about Bentonville

00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:00.450
is it really is in
the middle of nowhere.

00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:02.740
I mean this is
Little Abner country.

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:05.580
These are the "Beverly
Hillbillies," OK?

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:07.460
So that's the first
point that strikes you.

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:09.030
ERIC SCHMIDT: Running the
largest company in the world.

00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:10.290
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: So then you
have the question of, well,

00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:13.890
how did Little Abner become the
largest company in the world?

00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:17.490
And it's very interesting
because they out-innovated all

00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:17.990
their--

00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:21.120
they're mean, they're
nasty, they're tough,

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:23.340
and they were the
earliest adopters

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:28.920
of every new technology, from
computers to wireless to RFID.

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:30.330
And so why were they?

00:37:30.330 --> 00:37:36.190
Well, it was that there's no
mother like necessity, OK,

00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:39.480
that because they were out
there in the middle of nowhere

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:41.880
and had to get a global supply
chain that could connect

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:45.030
Bentonville, Arkansas
with all of these places,

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:47.010
they were early adopters.

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:50.721
And that seems to me to be what
Wal-Mart doesn't get credit

00:37:50.721 --> 00:37:51.220
for.

00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:54.120
I mean, they out-innovated
their competitors.

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:57.690
That's what allowed them to
be mean, nasty, and tough.

00:37:57.690 --> 00:37:59.520
At the same time,
it was precisely

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:01.440
because they were in
the middle of nowhere,

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:03.450
not in the middle of Manhattan.

00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:06.030
They were just so
focused on that,

00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:08.310
they lost sight of
everything else.

00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:10.680
And they, like baby
Huey, just grew up

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:13.470
to be the biggest
company in America

00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:19.260
without developing any of
the other habits, culture

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:21.870
that you really need
to go with that.

00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:31.055
Now, on the labor side,
I'm not so sure that--

00:38:37.167 --> 00:38:39.750
I know what you're asking, but
I don't address it in the books

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:41.400
so I'm thinking on my feet.

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:45.870
Because people often ask
me, what comes after this?

00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:47.610
And it does seem
to me more machines

00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:50.841
talking to machines is
really what comes after this.

00:38:50.841 --> 00:38:52.590
And I've got to believe
that's going to be

00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:54.750
a big part of supply chain.

00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:58.020
And therefore, what that's going
to mean for labor at the supply

00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:01.200
chain end, as opposed
to the retail front,

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:06.330
is probably not good in that
sense for unskilled labor

00:39:06.330 --> 00:39:09.177
would be my guess.

00:39:09.177 --> 00:39:10.260
ERIC SCHMIDT: That's good.

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:12.210
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Thank
you, Mr. Friedman.

00:39:12.210 --> 00:39:13.774
Since it's a technology
company here,

00:39:13.774 --> 00:39:15.940
I thought I'd like to ask
you a question about that.

00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:18.106
I noticed that many of the
10 triggers you mentioned

00:39:18.106 --> 00:39:20.010
were technologically oriented.

00:39:20.010 --> 00:39:22.680
I'm wondering, do
you see any kinds

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:25.260
of technological advancement
over the next couple of years

00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:27.218
that you think are going
to have a particularly

00:39:27.218 --> 00:39:29.490
strong influence, either
for good or for bad,

00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:31.200
on this flattening process?

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:33.642
Or maybe phrased another way,
say you were working here.

00:39:33.642 --> 00:39:35.100
What would be the
sorts of projects

00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:38.719
that you would be the most
excited about right now?

00:39:38.719 --> 00:39:40.260
ERIC SCHMIDT: And
by the way, I think

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:43.500
your offer is in your email.

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:48.900
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Well, I'll
tell you what worries me

00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:49.871
and what excites me.

00:39:49.871 --> 00:39:50.870
I kind of alluded to it.

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:58.010
What worries me is that
the flat world really

00:39:58.010 --> 00:40:01.880
is a friend of
Infosys and al-Qaeda.

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:05.090
And I see this more and more.

00:40:05.090 --> 00:40:08.330
Think about what terrorism used
to be and what it is today.

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:11.780
The old model of
terrorism was we go out,

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:14.840
we do an outrageous act, we get
the "New York Times" and CBS

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:19.280
to come and cover it, and we
rattle everyone in the world.

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:20.620
Not anymore.

00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:24.280
Now I go to bed, I fire
up AOL in the morning,

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:26.950
and there's a message from
Zarqawi, almost an email right

00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:31.940
to me, right there on my screen.

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:35.987
And so I'm worried about that.

00:40:35.987 --> 00:40:37.820
One thing I've learned
in doing all of this,

00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:41.450
the terrorists are
always early adopters.

00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:43.790
Terrorists are always
early adopters.

00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:45.590
And I'm afraid if
we're not as equally

00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:48.890
early adopters of
the latest technology

00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:54.320
that that will be
a real problem.

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:58.900
And so that's kind
of on the downside.

00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:00.610
On the upside, it
just seems to me

00:41:00.610 --> 00:41:03.700
that really what I
alluded to earlier,

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:09.280
that that 15-year-old
with a $12 phone

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:11.530
and an internet connection
that gets them onto Google

00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:15.400
in their own language, what
the implications of that

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:17.360
are going to be on the world.

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:22.710
That's really, really
going to be enormous.

00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:25.160
What worries me about it,
though, a little as a quasi

00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:27.440
public figure is
that we've moved

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:30.326
into an age where the
accusation is the punishment.

00:41:33.661 --> 00:41:36.160
My daughter goes off to college
and before she goes, and I'm

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:39.750
sure you've all heard this
story from your own experiences,

00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:41.500
she starts telling me
about her roommates.

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:43.480
And I say, well, how
do you know this?

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:45.580
And she said, I Googled them.

00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:48.580
I said, well, you mean your
roommates have a Google

00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:49.330
profile?

00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:52.630
I mean, these are high school
kids, you know what I mean?

00:41:52.630 --> 00:42:00.250
And so in this flat world, the
accusation is the punishment

00:42:00.250 --> 00:42:04.630
and your Google reputation
now will just stick with you.

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:06.700
Mark Twain said,
always tell the truth

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:09.220
and you never have to
remember what you said.

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:13.505
And it's doubly true now
in a world of Google,

00:42:13.505 --> 00:42:14.380
you know what I mean?

00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:19.120
You better behave well
because your Google reputation

00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:21.590
is going to stick with you.

00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:25.870
And so those are just some
of the things randomly

00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:29.260
that I'm thinking about.

00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:34.180
But I can just tell you,
as I said earlier, I just

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:38.730
wrote a whole book and my
research assistant was Google.

00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:42.790
I wrote this book in nine
months from a standing start.

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:46.360
I never could have
done it without search

00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:48.280
at the level of today.

00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:49.970
There's no question about it.

00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:53.680
And so for someone who's
really smart and a scientist,

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:57.532
that's got to be
really, really exciting.

00:42:57.532 --> 00:42:58.740
ERIC SCHMIDT: Well thank you.

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:04.540
AUDIENCE: You can look at the
history of the corporation

00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:08.770
kind of to see lessons learned
and best practices about people

00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:11.470
learning how to collaborate
and becoming more productive.

00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:13.450
And along with that
history, you see

00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:16.600
a trade-off with the free market
versus government intervention

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:20.380
tend to also protect, as well
as to encourage innovation.

00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:24.850
So now with a flat world that
crosses political boundaries,

00:43:24.850 --> 00:43:27.730
what do you see as the proper
role for our government

00:43:27.730 --> 00:43:29.260
or other governments
to get involved

00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:31.200
in regulating this process?

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:33.130
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: It's
an important question.

00:43:33.130 --> 00:43:34.660
I kind of lay out
my own philosophy

00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:40.180
in the book, which I call
compassionate flatism,

00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:43.300
that I believe since
we never really did

00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:45.190
compassionate conservatism,
we might as well

00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:46.552
get compassionate flatism.

00:43:46.552 --> 00:43:48.760
Because my argument is that
basically this flattening

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:50.550
process, this is
going to be as big

00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:52.070
as a challenge as communism.

00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:54.070
And if we don't have as
comprehensive a response

00:43:54.070 --> 00:43:57.280
to flatism as we
did to communism,

00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:59.740
it's going to be
enormously destabilizing.

00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:01.390
So let me go through
quickly the points

00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:02.780
that I believe are important.

00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:03.910
First of all, it
requires a different kind

00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:05.020
of political leadership.

00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:08.110
It requires political leaders
who won't make us stupid

00:44:08.110 --> 00:44:11.080
and will actually explain to
us the world we're living in,

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:13.040
both the challenges
and the opportunities,

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:15.260
and to get excited
about the opportunity.

00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:17.830
There's something incredibly
exciting about it,

00:44:17.830 --> 00:44:19.750
I can feel it every
time I come to Google.

00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:22.750
But what was the last time
you heard a politician really

00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:25.640
get excited about this world.

00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:27.860
So that's number one.

00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:30.190
And as an analog
to that, I happen

00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:36.990
to believe that there is
such an obvious opportunity

00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:41.970
for President Bush to inspire
the same kind of excitement

00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:45.150
about science and engineering
that President Kennedy did

00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:49.050
with the moonshot, to get
young men and women to go

00:44:49.050 --> 00:44:52.080
into science and engineering
in the numbers that

00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:54.180
did in the Kennedy day.

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:56.650
And that to me is
energy independence.

00:44:56.650 --> 00:45:00.760
To make energy independence the
moon shot of our generation,

00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:03.130
to get every young person
excited about going

00:45:03.130 --> 00:45:06.550
into science or engineering,
to make their contribution

00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:10.570
to the environment, to
geopolitics, to the deficit

00:45:10.570 --> 00:45:13.060
by making America
energy independent.

00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:15.220
It's so out there,
it's so obvious,

00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:16.921
and it would be so compelling.

00:45:16.921 --> 00:45:19.170
So first level different
kind of political leadership.

00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:21.130
Secondly, I believe we
need national health

00:45:21.130 --> 00:45:23.949
care, some version of
national health care.

00:45:23.949 --> 00:45:26.240
I can't tell you how many
CEOs I interviewed that said,

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:28.656
we're moving jobs abroad because
I don't want the unfunded

00:45:28.656 --> 00:45:31.036
liability of the health care.

00:45:31.036 --> 00:45:32.410
Short of that, we
definitely need

00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:34.810
totally portable pensions
and totally portable health

00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:36.970
care so people can take
their pensions and health

00:45:36.970 --> 00:45:39.220
care as they move
from job to job

00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:41.260
and be as flexible as
this world demands.

00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:43.405
Third, I think we
need wage insurance.

00:45:43.405 --> 00:45:45.530
And this idea I lay out in
the book is not my idea.

00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:47.710
Lori Kletzer and
Bob Litan lay this

00:45:47.710 --> 00:45:50.440
out as a way of easing
people who get caught

00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:53.860
in this into new jobs quickly.

00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:57.550
Fourthly, I believe
that we need to make

00:45:57.550 --> 00:46:00.730
tertiary education,
post-secondary education,

00:46:00.730 --> 00:46:03.370
available to every
American who wants it.

00:46:03.370 --> 00:46:07.930
I think it's just
the only solution.

00:46:07.930 --> 00:46:11.710
Lastly, we need a different
form of parenting.

00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:14.020
We're now blending with two
cultures, India and China,

00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:18.420
that have a very high
ethic of education.

00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:23.420
And that's why my advice is, I
mean, to myself as a parent is

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:27.630
to throw away the Gameboy,
shut off the stupid television,

00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:30.700
and get Johnny and
Susie down to work.

00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:33.817
Because I probably
said this last time,

00:46:33.817 --> 00:46:36.150
but when I was growing up,
my parents used to say to me,

00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:38.191
Tom, finish your dinner
people in China and India

00:46:38.191 --> 00:46:39.390
are starving.

00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:41.430
And I tell my girls,
girls, finish your homework

00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:42.810
because people in
China and India

00:46:42.810 --> 00:46:44.550
are starving for your job.

00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:49.637
And in a flat world,
they could have it.

00:46:49.637 --> 00:46:51.720
Bill Gates pointed out
something to me in the book

00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:55.160
that I think is very
important to keep in mind.

00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:57.720
30 years ago if you had a
choice of being born a B

00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:01.400
student in Palo Alto or a
genius in Bangalore or Beijing,

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:04.470
there was no question you wanted
to be a student in Palo Alto

00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:07.920
because your life choices
opportunities would be so much

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:11.760
greater as a B student in Palo
Alto than a genius in Bangalore

00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:12.570
and Beijing.

00:47:12.570 --> 00:47:14.580
When the world is
flat, you do not

00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:16.830
want to be a B
student in Palo Alto

00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:18.960
because every genius in
Bangalore and Beijing

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:20.950
can now plug and play,
compete, connect,

00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:24.700
and collaborate in ways they
never could have before.

00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:26.850
And so I think it takes
a different approach

00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:27.806
to parenting.

00:47:27.806 --> 00:47:30.180
As I said in my column this
morning that Eric alluded to,

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:31.554
I've had this
feeling for a while

00:47:31.554 --> 00:47:34.230
that we are our
Olympic basketball

00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:39.080
team, the sort of
lackadaisical team

00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:41.210
that just sort of thought
they could show up

00:47:41.210 --> 00:47:43.510
and they came on with
the bronze medal.

00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:47.210
And the way in which our
Olympic basketball team

00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:49.520
has kind of mirrored the
national mood I think

00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:52.496
is something to keep in mind.

00:47:52.496 --> 00:47:54.190
Go ahead.

00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:55.540
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming.

00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:57.540
I would imagine that the
flattening of the world

00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:01.991
would impact most places that
are otherwise been isolated

00:48:01.991 --> 00:48:02.740
and have perhaps--

00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:03.540
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Can you
please speak a little closer

00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:04.039
to the mic?

00:48:04.039 --> 00:48:05.100
AUDIENCE: Oh, sure.

00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:07.140
I would imagine that the
flattening of the world

00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:09.930
would impact most of the places
that have been isolated up

00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:10.830
until now.

00:48:10.830 --> 00:48:15.870
And the US, in my mind, is
not the most closed community.

00:48:15.870 --> 00:48:18.480
For instance, it has been
importing skilled and educated

00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:20.466
people for a long time.

00:48:20.466 --> 00:48:21.840
A lot of the same
people who have

00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:23.970
to be able to learn and
to adapt, a lot of them

00:48:23.970 --> 00:48:25.500
are in this room.

00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:29.430
It has had a pretty free
press and the capital markets

00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:30.630
are pretty well-functioning.

00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:33.840
So when you say that the
US is woefully unprepared,

00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:35.110
I'm curious.

00:48:35.110 --> 00:48:37.080
Do you mean is it
compared to the optimum

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:39.840
or compared to other
countries and what should we

00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:40.740
do to be prepared?

00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:42.479
And also, what do
you teach your kids?

00:48:42.479 --> 00:48:44.020
How do you prepare
for what's coming?

00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:44.340
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Good.

00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:45.190
It's a good question.

00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:46.440
I think it's compared
to the optimum.

00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:48.023
I think it's compared
to what we could

00:48:48.023 --> 00:48:50.820
be given the natural resources
that we have as a country.

00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:54.220
And I mean not just material
ones, but institutional ones,

00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:55.410
just what you referred to--

00:48:55.410 --> 00:48:57.570
the best research
universities in the world,

00:48:57.570 --> 00:48:59.820
the best rule of law, the
best intellectual property

00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:00.544
protection.

00:49:00.544 --> 00:49:02.460
I think we've got all
the secrets of the sauce

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:03.926
to succeed in this world.

00:49:03.926 --> 00:49:05.550
The question is, are
we enriching them,

00:49:05.550 --> 00:49:06.715
are we investing in them?

00:49:06.715 --> 00:49:09.090
What are we doing cutting the
National Science Foundation

00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:13.930
budget by $100 million last
year at this moment in time?

00:49:13.930 --> 00:49:14.820
So it's really that.

00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:18.960
It's really trying to attention
people to those choices

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:21.270
that I'm really
trying to focus on.

00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:23.960
I don't think we're in a
crisis today, but in 15 years

00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:27.210
I think we could be in a
crisis, one that really would

00:49:27.210 --> 00:49:28.770
affect our standard of living.

00:49:28.770 --> 00:49:31.801
Look, our relative lead over
the world is going to shrink,

00:49:31.801 --> 00:49:32.550
that's inevitable.

00:49:32.550 --> 00:49:35.080
The question is whether
absolutely it does.

00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:37.340
And I think that
depends on what we do.

00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:40.190
ERIC SCHMIDT: So we're pretty
much running out of time.

00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:43.680
We've got four Googlers who
have important questions.

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:45.440
In the spirit of
moving forward, Larry,

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:47.720
can you ask your question
and we'll have Kim

00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:49.740
and Peter and so forth
and then maybe you can

00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:52.322
give a combined answer as a--

00:49:52.322 --> 00:49:54.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:54.890 --> 00:49:56.013
This is a test.

00:49:56.013 --> 00:49:57.110
You're going to do well.

00:49:57.110 --> 00:49:58.070
Larry, go ahead.

00:49:58.070 --> 00:49:59.960
LARRY PAGE: Actually, I want
to answer one of your questions

00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:00.150
first.

00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:01.733
ERIC SCHMIDT: That's
not what I asked.

00:50:01.733 --> 00:50:03.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:03.050 --> 00:50:05.270
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Now
I know I'm at Google.

00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:05.650
LARRY PAGE: Well, no.

00:50:05.650 --> 00:50:07.040
You asked, when
was the last time

00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:08.810
you heard a politician
who was generally

00:50:08.810 --> 00:50:10.970
interested in technology?

00:50:10.970 --> 00:50:13.520
Both Colin Powell and
Al Gore visited recently

00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:17.840
and to my viewpoint, at least,
they both genuinely were.

00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:18.740
So they do exist.

00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:24.170
I don't actually have a question
as much sort of a request

00:50:24.170 --> 00:50:26.970
for comments about two ideas.

00:50:26.970 --> 00:50:30.350
One of them is competition
and the other one

00:50:30.350 --> 00:50:34.487
is what I like to call
the militant moderates.

00:50:34.487 --> 00:50:36.070
So basically, on the
competition side,

00:50:36.070 --> 00:50:39.650
the basic question
there is has in history

00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:42.080
or in present or
going future there

00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:45.260
been a country,
society, or company

00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:48.250
that's ever been able
to thrive and survive

00:50:48.250 --> 00:50:51.770
in the absence of any
threat or any competition?

00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:54.200
And then the question
on the moderate side

00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:58.340
is I sort of take the
fundamental viewpoint

00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:01.550
that the average or the
majority is, in fact, moderate

00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:05.570
and I'm just sort of wondering
when these various things are

00:51:05.570 --> 00:51:08.090
happening, when there's the
various turmoil, at what point

00:51:08.090 --> 00:51:10.850
does that majority
actually regain

00:51:10.850 --> 00:51:13.215
the power from the extremes?

00:51:13.215 --> 00:51:14.090
ERIC SCHMIDT: So Kim.

00:51:14.090 --> 00:51:15.830
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Good point.

00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:17.350
AUDIENCE: Very quickly.

00:51:17.350 --> 00:51:19.490
So to what extent are
you concerned that we're

00:51:19.490 --> 00:51:21.920
creating a new
underclass of people

00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:24.350
who no matter how
educated they are simply

00:51:24.350 --> 00:51:26.690
don't have the
intellectual capability

00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:28.970
to keep up in this
new world and what

00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:31.840
do we do about that so it's
no longer access to capital

00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:33.247
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:51:33.247 --> 00:51:34.080
ERIC SCHMIDT: Peter.

00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:35.871
AUDIENCE: So first of
all, thanks for doing

00:51:35.871 --> 00:51:37.110
your research on Google.

00:51:37.110 --> 00:51:40.790
And I recognize that now the
responsibility for eliminating

00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:43.250
errors in the "New York
Times" has partially

00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:46.220
shifted from you to my team.

00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:49.720
ERIC SCHMIDT: I believe you are
the director of quality, right,

00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:52.460
so the responsibility
is directly on you.

00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:55.970
AUDIENCE: So we'll try not
to let the "Times" down.

00:51:55.970 --> 00:52:00.501
But I wanted to say on the
US finishing 17th in the ACM

00:52:00.501 --> 00:52:02.000
contest, I think
that's a little bit

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:03.230
alarmist to worry about that.

00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:06.320
The way I interpret
it is if you're

00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:09.530
a hot team of programmers
in India or Latvia,

00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:12.860
the best thing you can do is go
make your name on that contest,

00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:15.430
whereas if you're in the US,
you go out and start a company.

00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:15.790
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Interesting.

00:52:15.790 --> 00:52:16.410
That's a good point.

00:52:16.410 --> 00:52:17.670
AUDIENCE: It seems like it's
still easier to do that here.

00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:19.128
THOMAS FRIEDMAN:
It's a good point.

00:52:19.128 --> 00:52:20.550
That's interesting.

00:52:20.550 --> 00:52:22.050
AUDIENCE: The answer
to his question

00:52:22.050 --> 00:52:23.466
is going to be
interesting enough,

00:52:23.466 --> 00:52:25.890
so I'm not going to ask mine.

00:52:25.890 --> 00:52:28.260
I think I'll just
see you afterwards.

00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:30.930
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: OK.

00:52:30.930 --> 00:52:34.560
Well, boy.

00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:37.310
Next question, yeah.

00:52:37.310 --> 00:52:37.810
Yeah.

00:52:42.690 --> 00:52:44.850
On the question of are we
creating an underclass,

00:52:44.850 --> 00:52:47.610
I mean anymore than the
underclass we already have?

00:52:47.610 --> 00:52:51.180
Again, I'm going to retreat
into I just don't know.

00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:54.420
I think we're so new into
this flattening process

00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:57.276
that it's very hard to
predict how it will come out.

00:52:57.276 --> 00:52:59.400
And I think there's so many
political choices to be

00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:05.850
made that it's very hard to say
anything categoric about that.

00:53:05.850 --> 00:53:08.676
Charlie Rose asked me, who would
you like to read this book?

00:53:08.676 --> 00:53:10.050
And I said, without
question, I'd

00:53:10.050 --> 00:53:12.270
like President Bush
to read the book.

00:53:12.270 --> 00:53:18.020
And I wasn't being cute at
all for a very simple reason.

00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:22.244
Well, listened to it on tape
or whatever works for him.

00:53:22.244 --> 00:53:24.614
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:27.395 --> 00:53:29.410
They're so bad up here.

00:53:29.410 --> 00:53:30.660
OK.

00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:32.250
This front row is terrible.

00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:32.750
OK.

00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:40.306
But I really meant that because
in the sense that we don't have

00:53:40.306 --> 00:53:42.930
three and a half years to waste,
we don't have three and a half

00:53:42.930 --> 00:53:45.960
years-- this really gets
back to the question of--

00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:49.560
to sit around and wait
and hope that someone

00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:53.230
three and a half years
from now gets that better.

00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:55.870
I really don't want to waste
three and a half years.

00:53:55.870 --> 00:54:02.800
I think that we're
in a quiet crisis,

00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:05.800
as Shirley Ann Jackson, the
head of Rensselaer Polytechnic,

00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:07.720
describes it.

00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:09.089
And she is of the people--

00:54:09.089 --> 00:54:11.380
Shirley Ann Jackson is the
first African-American woman

00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:14.030
to win a PhD in
physics from MIT.

00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:17.590
And she was part of that
generation of scientists

00:54:17.590 --> 00:54:20.200
and engineers who were
inspired by the moonshot

00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:23.020
to go into science
and engineering.

00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:30.370
So again, to repeat what Paul
Romer said, we're in a crisis

00:54:30.370 --> 00:54:33.040
and a crisis is a
terrible thing to waste.

00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:35.530
And so I would hate
to waste this crisis.

00:54:35.530 --> 00:54:37.610
ERIC SCHMIDT: Every
time I talk to you,

00:54:37.610 --> 00:54:41.460
I feel like I need to talk
to you for another 10 hours

00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:43.690
to understand at this level.

00:54:43.690 --> 00:54:47.140
It is an extraordinary vision
that you have laid out.

00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:49.840
I'm sure you're
right and I'm glad--

00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:51.340
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: I
hope so because I

00:54:51.340 --> 00:54:53.270
quoted Google an awful lot.

00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:56.290
ERIC SCHMIDT: I'm really, really
glad that you were willing--

00:54:56.290 --> 00:54:58.960
you're busy, you were willing to
come back here and talk to us.

00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:02.150
Now, we wanted to present you
with the Google Web Accelerator

00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.750
boomerang.

00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:04.030
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Wow.

00:55:04.030 --> 00:55:04.900
ERIC SCHMIDT: And
the reason is, first

00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:06.090
we're very proud
of this product,

00:55:06.090 --> 00:55:07.400
it makes the
internet much faster

00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:08.983
which is very important
in flattening.

00:55:08.983 --> 00:55:12.690
But also, it's because
boomerangs always come back.

00:55:12.690 --> 00:55:15.530
Now, I actually wanted
to do something unusual.

00:55:15.530 --> 00:55:17.750
I wanted to ask one
person in the audience

00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:20.450
to make some comments
or wrap up or generally

00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:22.430
say whatever he
would like to do,

00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:23.930
so I prepared the
microphone and I'm

00:55:23.930 --> 00:55:26.330
going to present him with
a boomerang, as well.

00:55:26.330 --> 00:55:27.920
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Terrific.

00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:30.720
ERIC SCHMIDT: And perhaps--

00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:33.135
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:34.584 --> 00:55:41.687

ROBIN WILLIAMS: Thank you.

00:55:42.770 --> 00:55:43.269
Thank you.

00:55:43.269 --> 00:55:45.230
I have a very large
hard drive right now.

00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:47.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:51.380
Thank you on behalf of
the new German pope.

00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:54.970
Oh, stand up on the stage?

00:55:54.970 --> 00:55:56.094
There?

00:55:56.094 --> 00:55:58.454
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:59.400 --> 00:55:59.910
Thank you.

00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:04.270
First of all, it's a flat world.

00:56:04.270 --> 00:56:07.610
This is a Rubik's cube.

00:56:07.610 --> 00:56:10.970
I was just wandering around
your building and going, Jesus,

00:56:10.970 --> 00:56:13.590
you have no furniture.

00:56:13.590 --> 00:56:18.050
So that will be the future in
a flat world, you won't sit

00:56:18.050 --> 00:56:19.670
and you'll have
food every 100 feet.

00:56:22.822 --> 00:56:23.780
What a wonderful thing.

00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:31.620
This is basically an
aboriginal word processor.

00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:35.495
In the old days, there were
people [ODD SPEECH SOUNDS].

00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:42.780
That was the first
aboriginal modem.

00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:46.400
[ODD SPEECH SOUNDS]

00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:49.440
That was Miriam Makeba's
answering machine.

00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:51.440
The folks up there have
been looking down on you

00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:56.330
for the whole day going,
we're so much better than you.

00:56:56.330 --> 00:57:00.260
And this is actually the
intestine for the building.

00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:02.270
You don't know it, but
this is taking everything

00:57:02.270 --> 00:57:06.710
that you take from every 100
feet, runs it through there,

00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:09.890
and vents it out to you
over a period of time.

00:57:09.890 --> 00:57:11.864
For me, I'm just
watching and enjoying.

00:57:11.864 --> 00:57:14.030
Like he said, he was hoping
that Bush reads the book

00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:16.113
or gets it on tape or at
least sees some pictures.

00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:22.430
He's a simple man
and as he himself

00:57:22.430 --> 00:57:26.300
said, is our children learning?

00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:31.950
Which gets a lot of kids
excited about is they learning?

00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:37.820
If you look up Bush in Google,
it's really pretty open-ended.

00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:38.810
It's not a porn site.

00:57:38.810 --> 00:57:41.300
I know many of you
were thinking that.

00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:43.265
Even though Dick Cheney
sounds like, hmm.

00:57:46.430 --> 00:57:49.840
Revenge of the south, really.

00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:51.204
Do what I say now, George.

00:57:51.204 --> 00:57:52.120
You will be my friend.

00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:57.510
He's a good man.

00:57:57.510 --> 00:58:01.860
I'm hoping that somehow that
he has an AI working with him.

00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:04.584
He has GPS actually
on his desk that

00:58:04.584 --> 00:58:06.500
tells him where certain
parts of the world are

00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:08.854
and how to get there.

00:58:08.854 --> 00:58:10.520
When machines start
talking to machines,

00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:11.645
that will be a scary thing.

00:58:11.645 --> 00:58:16.155
I had a Mercedes Benz that had
a phone that you could dial.

00:58:16.155 --> 00:58:17.280
You'd speak out the number.

always wanting more.

And it gave me
directions one day.

I wanted to get to
Marin County, it

00:58:27.038 --> 00:58:30.471
directed me to basically
the middle of the Bay.

00:58:30.471 --> 00:58:32.220
And if I could get
there, probably the car

00:58:32.220 --> 00:58:33.941
would be going, [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:38.050
This is obviously great.

00:58:38.050 --> 00:58:39.800

bright as you are need

to have your name that big?

have a search engine.

dream for search engine.

was, where are pants?

Talk about mainframes
and accessing mainframes.

It is a good day to wonder why.

00:59:49.971 --> 00:59:51.720

Stephen Hawking's house.

00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:53.204
Hello, this is Stephen Hawking.

00:59:53.204 --> 00:59:54.620
Yeah, I'd like to
leave a message.

No, this is Stephen Hawking.

01:00:00.946 --> 01:00:04.570

offended by that.

doing following you.

01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:55.750
Watch now, you will learn.

01:00:55.750 --> 01:00:59.150
I will dub you better than you.

01:00:59.150 --> 01:01:01.140
Your culture is falling apart.

01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:04.240
And even the English
are going, get ready.

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:06.460
Look at us, we have-- well,
look at the royal family.

01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:10.229
It's basically "Deliverance"
staged by Fortnum &amp; Mason.

01:01:10.229 --> 01:01:11.770
You have to look at
them and realize,

01:01:11.770 --> 01:01:13.980
there's a culture, a very
well-educated culture,

01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:15.300
the royal family.

01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:17.050
All of that money
and no dental plan.

01:01:20.379 --> 01:01:22.420
That's some pretty ugly
people for being the head

01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:25.060
of a nation going, hello.

01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:25.930
I'm getting married.

01:01:29.206 --> 01:01:30.655
Sorry.

01:01:30.655 --> 01:01:32.470
The "New York
Times" [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:35.600
It's a good paper.

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:38.020
You've got new fact checkers.

01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:39.000
Is this real?

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.800
I don't know.

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:44.890
There is a new Israeli web
server called Netanyahoo.

01:01:49.965 --> 01:01:51.100
Or "You've Got Moyle."

01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:59.089
Goigle, gentile
web server, goigle.

01:01:59.089 --> 01:02:00.880
Well, thank you for
letting me riff up here

01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:04.595
in front of people
with college degrees.

01:02:04.595 --> 01:02:06.970
A lot of the engineers will
go up in the flowchart going,

01:02:06.970 --> 01:02:11.000
two Jewish squid walk into
a bar or two Irishmen.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.832
No, they'd never walk out.

01:02:13.832 --> 01:02:15.790
It's like the two Irish
guys in the boat going,

01:02:15.790 --> 01:02:16.480
oh, [INAUDIBLE], Bob.

01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:17.080
I've got to piss.

01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:17.890
I've got to take a piss.

01:02:17.890 --> 01:02:19.390
He said, I want to
make a wish first.

01:02:19.390 --> 01:02:19.540
All right.

01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:20.039
Make a wish.

01:02:20.039 --> 01:02:22.630
I wish the ocean was Guinness.

01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:23.737
The ocean is Guinness.

01:02:23.737 --> 01:02:25.570
And then the other one
says, you damn idiot,

01:02:25.570 --> 01:02:26.400
what have you done that for?

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:27.550
He says, why, what
are you pissed off?

01:02:27.550 --> 01:02:28.030
He said, no.

01:02:28.030 --> 01:02:29.071
Where am I going to piss?

01:02:29.071 --> 01:02:31.555
Shut up, [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:31.555 --> 01:02:33.430
I wish us all good luck
with the German pope,

01:02:33.430 --> 01:02:34.763
I just spoke briefly about this.

01:02:34.763 --> 01:02:36.100
I was hoping--

01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:38.380
I mean, obviously it
is an unusual thing

01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:41.934
that his nickname
was Der Panzer Pope.

01:02:41.934 --> 01:02:43.600
Obviously, the Swiss
guard is very happy

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:47.110
because finally
they get artillery.

01:02:47.110 --> 01:02:49.180
I was hoping for maybe
a Brazilian pope.

01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:51.190
I mean, Pope Raul
would be lovely.

01:02:51.190 --> 01:02:53.480
And the nuns going
[FAKE BRAZILIAN SPEECH].

01:02:58.210 --> 01:03:00.480
The African pope,
Pope [INAUDIBLE],

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:02.240
[FAKE AFRICAN SPEECH].

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:03.940
Or we can have an
African-American pope

01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:07.080
and we call him Pope Diddy.

01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:08.500
I got the bling, man.

01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:10.180
Yeah, I've got my
ring [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:11.850
All my beeyotches, I like
to call my nun [INAUDIBLE],

01:03:11.850 --> 01:03:13.308
even though they're
hear right now.

01:03:13.308 --> 01:03:14.160
Now.

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:15.020
Look at my jewelry.

01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:16.240
Yo, check the ermine.

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:18.270
I'm looking hot.

01:03:18.270 --> 01:03:21.942
P. Diddy in the house
riding the Pope Mobile.

01:03:21.942 --> 01:03:23.880
Boom, boom.

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:28.114
I guess I'm not going to
heaven, but what the hell.

01:03:28.114 --> 01:03:32.282
If you've got a helicopter
waiting, I've got a hybrid.

01:03:32.282 --> 01:03:34.240
For those of you that
have a hybrid, good luck.

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:38.020
It's basically a golf
cart on steroids.

01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:40.560
It makes a noise when it backs
up so even deaf people go.

01:03:47.805 --> 01:03:53.660
You'll all go home tonight and
go, what the fuck have I done?

01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:57.380
I've stood in front of people
who have access to technology.

01:03:57.380 --> 01:03:57.880
All right.

01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:00.547
Hold on, let me take
a picture of you.

01:04:00.547 --> 01:04:02.880
I actually saw a mobile phone
that didn't have a camera.

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:04.340
I went, oh, you sad bastard.

01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:07.667
It's so crazy.

01:04:07.667 --> 01:04:09.250
Now everyone has
these little headsets

01:04:09.250 --> 01:04:11.990
and they're talking ha-ha.

01:04:11.990 --> 01:04:13.150
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:15.310
Hold on.

01:04:15.310 --> 01:04:17.280
I actually saw a guy who
was talking to himself

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:19.996
and he went, thank you.

01:04:19.996 --> 01:04:22.120
Thank you for still being
out of your fucking mind.

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:24.550
Thank you.

01:04:24.550 --> 01:04:26.020
How small will the
technology get?

01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:27.610
Will it be like, OK, you
eventually get implants,

01:04:27.610 --> 01:04:28.900
you're going, yeah,
hold on one second.

01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:29.290
Yeah.

01:04:29.290 --> 01:04:29.789
Oh, yeah.

01:04:29.789 --> 01:04:31.171
Hold on.

01:04:31.171 --> 01:04:32.170
Yeah I'm getting a call.

01:04:32.170 --> 01:04:34.460
Hold on, I've got call waiting.

01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:35.870
Wait a minute.

01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:38.724
I'm going to take a picture now.

01:04:38.724 --> 01:04:39.640
I just took a picture.

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:40.480
I'm downloading-- oh, wait.

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:41.354
I'm getting your fax.

01:04:41.354 --> 01:04:44.735
Hold on.

01:04:44.735 --> 01:04:46.715
Thomas Friedman,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:04:46.715 --> 01:04:49.190
[APPLAUSE]

01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:51.165
ERIC SCHMIDT: Robin Williams.

01:04:51.165 --> 01:04:51.665
Robin.

01:04:51.665 --> 01:04:54.140
[APPLAUSE]

01:05:12.182 --> 01:05:13.015
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: OK.

01:05:17.270 --> 01:05:19.780
SERGEY BRIN: Eric was
complaining that my jokes TGIF

01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:23.966
were getting stale so
he brought a ringer.

01:05:23.966 --> 01:05:25.840
You don't have to get
Robin Williams, though.

01:05:28.589 --> 01:05:30.380
Well, thank you very
much, Tom, for coming.

01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:33.550
By the way, I thought because
your book came out shortly

01:05:33.550 --> 01:05:35.980
after we launched the
satellite view on Maps,

01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:37.966
I thought, wow, that was fast.

01:05:37.966 --> 01:05:40.090
Right away he saw that and
he wrote the whole book,

01:05:40.090 --> 01:05:43.110
"The World is Flat."

01:05:43.110 --> 01:05:45.070
But now thanks to
him, we can delay

01:05:45.070 --> 01:05:47.690
some of the work we were
going to do on Keyhole,

01:05:47.690 --> 01:05:48.790
which is the 3D viewer.

01:05:48.790 --> 01:05:52.830
I know that's not
necessary anymore.

01:05:52.830 --> 01:05:54.580
Anyway, thank you very
much for coming by.

01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:55.150
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Pleasure.

01:05:55.150 --> 01:05:56.440
SERGEY BRIN: It's
always a pleasure.

01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:58.260
And round of applause
for Tom Friedman.

01:05:58.260 --> 01:06:01.930
[APPLAUSE]
