Hi and welcome to Inferential Statistics. This course builds

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.830
on the skills you previously learned in Descriptive Statistics. Now

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.140
if you haven't taken Descriptive Stats yet, feel free

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.610
to follow the link in the instructor's notes box to

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.570
our descriptive stats class. Statistician John Tukey said an

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.620
approximate answer to the right problem is worth a good

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.250
deal more than the exact answer to an approximate problem.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.188
Now in this course you will learn to apply statistics

00:00:26.188 --> 00:00:30.529
to find these approximate answers, make predictions about data, as well as

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.597
run tests to verify the accuracy of a model. And for your

00:00:33.597 --> 00:00:36.864
final project, you will get the chance to make your own predictions

00:00:36.864 --> 00:00:39.790
on a data set. So, let's go to Katie Kormanik to get started
