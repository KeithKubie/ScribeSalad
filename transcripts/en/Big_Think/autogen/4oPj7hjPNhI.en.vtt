and that's not too dissimilar from

and that's not too dissimilar from
 

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:18.620

in Los Angeles and they're deciding
 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.010
in Los Angeles and they're deciding
what's going to be on television and

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020
what's going to be on television and
 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.990
what's going to be on television and
then they distribute it to those towers

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000
then they distribute it to those towers
 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.639
then they distribute it to those towers
and at 7:00 p.m.

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649
and at 7:00 p.m.
 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:30.980

primetime we aggregate around a

television that's been brought into our
home and we watch this one

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:34.859

incontrovertible truth in this signal
from a top-down approach and when the

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770
from a top-down approach and when the
 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.580
from a top-down approach and when the
internet started enabling people first

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590
internet started enabling people first
 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.020

with this underlying network
architecture of tcp/ip that allowed us

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060
architecture of tcp/ip that allowed us
 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.940
architecture of tcp/ip that allowed us
to transcend time and distance that

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950
to transcend time and distance that
 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.370
to transcend time and distance that
allowed any node on the network to

allowed any node on the network to
 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.529
allowed any node on the network to
contribute to the system and then we

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539
contribute to the system and then we
 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:56.270
contribute to the system and then we
started seeing things like video sharing

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280
started seeing things like video sharing
 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.749
started seeing things like video sharing
and photo sharing that allowed us all to

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759
and photo sharing that allowed us all to
 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.120
and photo sharing that allowed us all to
become publishers and then we had this

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130
become publishers and then we had this
 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.849

kind of now this layer of social that

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:04.859

kind of now this layer of social that
has is redefining everything where every

that is destroying the ability to
