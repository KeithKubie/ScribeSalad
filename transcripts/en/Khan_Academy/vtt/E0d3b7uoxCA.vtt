00:00:02.472 --> 00:00:04.286
- So I'm here with David Coleman

00:00:04.286 --> 00:00:05.919
who's the president of the College Board,

00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:07.286
and we have a pretty big

00:00:07.286 --> 00:00:09.573
announcement/collaboration together.

00:00:09.573 --> 00:00:11.422
Tell us more about what
we're doing, David.

00:00:11.422 --> 00:00:12.765
- I'm super excited,

00:00:12.765 --> 00:00:14.365
'cause today the College
Board is announcing

00:00:14.365 --> 00:00:15.783
a broader and renewed commitment

00:00:15.783 --> 00:00:16.989
to delivering opportunity.

00:00:16.989 --> 00:00:19.102
Which means going beyond
an assessment itself

00:00:19.102 --> 00:00:20.837
to make sure kids take advantage of

00:00:20.837 --> 00:00:22.154
the opportunities they earned.

00:00:22.154 --> 00:00:24.551
But also to dare to take seriously

00:00:24.551 --> 00:00:27.097
the corruptions that have
risen around the exam process.

00:00:27.244 --> 00:00:29.182
What I mean is the perception

00:00:29.182 --> 00:00:32.677
that costly test preparation
has made the ground uneven.

00:00:33.003 --> 00:00:35.074
And this exam at its finest
should be about merit,

00:00:35.074 --> 00:00:37.300
should be about hard work
that's equally available to all.

00:00:37.501 --> 00:00:39.822
And there is no better
statement of world class,

00:00:39.822 --> 00:00:41.132
high quality stuff for all,

00:00:41.132 --> 00:00:42.771
than partnering with Kahn Academy,

00:00:42.771 --> 00:00:45.817
to provide free SAT test
preparation for the world,

00:00:45.817 --> 00:00:47.418
which is what we commit to today.

00:00:47.418 --> 00:00:48.745
- And I just wanna, you know,

00:00:48.745 --> 00:00:50.944
I guess doubly underline
what you just said.

00:00:50.944 --> 00:00:53.081
I mean, we all remember
when we took the SAT

00:00:53.081 --> 00:00:55.009
there's you know, there are some folks

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:57.699
taking these fairly costly prep courses

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:00.224
based on the idea that it might help them,

00:01:00.224 --> 00:01:02.320
and maybe on the margin it did help them.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.016
And what we're saying together is,

00:01:05.616 --> 00:01:07.426
that ability to pay for that,

00:01:07.426 --> 00:01:09.314
should not be a factor anymore.

00:01:10.437 --> 00:01:11.412
- You're exactly right.

00:01:11.412 --> 00:01:12.603
And what should be a factor,

00:01:12.603 --> 00:01:13.984
is the quality of your practice.

00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:17.233
And your command of
mathematics for example.

00:01:17.233 --> 00:01:19.559
Which is as you know to
command a few things well.

00:01:19.559 --> 00:01:21.217
So as we redesign the exam,

00:01:21.217 --> 00:01:23.197
we're allowing kids to really focus

00:01:23.197 --> 00:01:24.716
on the math that matters most,

00:01:24.716 --> 00:01:26.534
that's the most flexible and widely used.

00:01:26.534 --> 00:01:28.918
And the only way to gain
real command of that

00:01:28.918 --> 00:01:30.084
is through practice.

00:01:30.084 --> 00:01:31.881
- And what I'm really excited about,

00:01:31.881 --> 00:01:34.268
you know when we first
started talking about this,

00:01:34.268 --> 00:01:35.627
this isn't just you know,

00:01:35.627 --> 00:01:36.735
"Hey, Kahn Academy,

00:01:36.735 --> 00:01:38.251
"why don't you just try
to see what you can do

00:01:38.251 --> 00:01:39.740
"and make some test-prep materials".

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.518
it's really about a
very close collaboration

00:01:42.518 --> 00:01:43.837
where we work together.

00:01:43.837 --> 00:01:45.212
And not just to make a,

00:01:45.212 --> 00:01:46.948
"Hey, you know if you
can't afford something,

00:01:46.948 --> 00:01:47.963
"here's something nice".

00:01:47.963 --> 00:01:49.684
But to make something truly world class

00:01:49.684 --> 00:01:51.427
so that we can make something that's

00:01:51.427 --> 00:01:52.811
as good or better

00:01:52.811 --> 00:01:56.013
than any of the high-cost
courses or materials,

00:01:56.013 --> 00:01:57.182
but do it for free.

00:01:57.182 --> 00:01:59.294
- That's exactly our shared aspiration.

00:01:59.294 --> 00:02:01.429
And we wanna go beyond
narrow test preparation,

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:04.390
to really preparing kids
for an understanding

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.884
and skill and fluency
with math and literacy,

00:02:06.884 --> 00:02:08.208
that allows them to encounter

00:02:08.208 --> 00:02:09.821
a wide range of problems with confidence.

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:12.397
- And I think that's
where we're very aligned.

00:02:12.397 --> 00:02:13.863
Because the one thing even when my,

00:02:13.863 --> 00:02:15.280
my cousins were,

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.189
or even when a lot of my
friends were taking the SAT,

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:18.655
they would take these courses and say,

00:02:18.655 --> 00:02:19.670
"Oh, when in doubt guess C,

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.389
"and rule this answer out".
- [David] Exactly.

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:22.934
- And I would always tell people no,

00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:26.093
if you really understand
the underlying mathematics

00:02:26.093 --> 00:02:27.459
or the underlying grammar,

00:02:28.428 --> 00:02:29.909
you don't have to play these games.

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.381
That the answers will come to you,

00:02:32.381 --> 00:02:34.144
and so the way we're going to tackle this

00:02:34.144 --> 00:02:36.526
isn't about kind of gaming the system.

00:02:36.526 --> 00:02:39.357
It's really about getting
those core fundamental ideas

00:02:39.357 --> 00:02:41.702
so not only will you do well
on the SAT and other tests,

00:02:41.702 --> 00:02:43.245
you'll actually be prepared for college.

00:02:43.245 --> 00:02:45.830
- And the redesigned SAT
makes that clearer than ever.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.493
That's it's no longer about tricks,

00:02:47.493 --> 00:02:49.461
guessing is not penalized,

00:02:49.461 --> 00:02:50.837
you put your best answer forward.

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:52.147
We're talking about reading with

00:02:52.147 --> 00:02:53.730
attention to evidence when you read.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.727
We're talking about a core of math that is

00:02:55.727 --> 00:02:57.422
flexible, as you say, for the future.

00:02:57.422 --> 00:02:59.262
So it's much less about tricks,

00:02:59.262 --> 00:03:00.576
about mysterious things,

00:03:00.576 --> 00:03:02.949
than an open exam that
celebrates good work.

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.806
And the work you've done
in your high school.

00:03:04.806 --> 00:03:07.442
- Well, all of us, the whole
team here at Kahn Academy,

00:03:07.442 --> 00:03:09.670
you know we've always been
all about the student,

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.461
helping the student kind of
take control of their learning.

00:03:12.638 --> 00:03:14.862
And we're honored that you guys would

00:03:15.861 --> 00:03:17.325
work with us on this, once again,

00:03:17.325 --> 00:03:19.774
very close partnership to make not just a

00:03:19.774 --> 00:03:22.206
nice to have tool for students,

00:03:22.206 --> 00:03:24.598
but a really interactive, deep experience,

00:03:24.598 --> 00:03:26.065
that is as good as,

00:03:26.065 --> 00:03:28.029
or frankly I think it's
going to be much better

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:29.104
than anything else out there.

00:03:29.104 --> 00:03:31.270
- No, to be clear, this will
be the only place in the world,

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:32.389
and free to the world,

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:33.630
besides on our own website,

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.677
that students will be able to encounter

00:03:35.677 --> 00:03:37.064
materials for the exam

00:03:37.064 --> 00:03:40.317
that are ensurely focused
on the core of the math

00:03:40.317 --> 00:03:41.957
and the literacy that matters most.

00:03:41.957 --> 00:03:43.967
We will partner with the
Kahn Academy to ensure

00:03:43.967 --> 00:03:46.339
the quality and validity of every item,

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:47.588
every practice item,

00:03:47.588 --> 00:03:49.779
and make sure that this
work we do together

00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:51.220
is of the highest quality.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.963
And there will be no
other such partnerships,

00:03:52.963 --> 00:03:54.676
so I think it can be
the very best there is.

00:03:54.676 --> 00:03:55.966
- Super exciting.

00:03:55.966 --> 00:03:57.570
- Thank you.
