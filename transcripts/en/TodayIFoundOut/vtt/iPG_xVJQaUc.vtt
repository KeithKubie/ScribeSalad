00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:11.150
Forgotten History - The First Movie and the
Scientific Question It Sought to Answer

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.500
The first films were little more than what
we would consider short clips, a boxer throwing

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.500
a single punch or train arriving at a station–
the type of scenes that today you might only

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.400
see in the form of animated gifs.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.270
While popular perception is that movies got
their start around the early twentieth century,

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.510
the real seed that grew into the film industry
came a few decades before that in Eadweard

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.820
Muybridge’s truly revolutionary 1878 “Horse
in Motion.”

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.949
While it and hundreds of subsequent similar
works Muybridge filmed wowed audiences the

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:45.050
world over, this first film was not created
to entertain, but to answer a question.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.629
For centuries, artists, horse enthusiasts
and scientists alike had wondered: Do all

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.440
four of a horse’s hooves leave the ground
in mid gallop?

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.250
While this might seem silly and obvious to
us today, at the time it was not so.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.129
In fact, if you look at artists’ depictions
of horses galloping throughout history up

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.920
to Muybridge’s “Horse in Motion,” they
almost universally depict the horse in gallop

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.170
incorrectly.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.990
The problem, of course, was that this question
could not be answered by the naked eye.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.580
And leading up to the momentous “Horse in
Motion,” photographic technology of the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.250
day wasn’t up to the task of clearly capturing
a horse galloping.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.920
Enter Leland Stanford, who wanted to answer
this question and, in the process, learn as

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.250
much as possible about how horses run in order
to potentially improve the performance of

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.520
his race horses.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.590
For a little background on the man, while
today many have only heard of him because

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.310
of the University he helped found (in homage
to his son who died at 16), by today’s standards,

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.630
Leland Stanford was somewhat corrupt.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.070
He initially made his fortune by selling mining
equipment to those who came west for the California

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.070
Gold Rush.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.680
He then invested a significant portion of
this money into the California Central Pacific

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.630
Railroad, becoming one of the “Big Four”
to financially spur the success of the iconic

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.630
railway.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.030
At the same time (and perhaps because of it),
he was elected California’s governor.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.990
Using the office to enrich himself and his
fellow investors further, he secured massive

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.280
state investment and land grants for the railroad
project.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.530
He became ludicrously wealthy (at his peak
having a net worth of about $1.5 billion in

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.019
today’s dollars), owned several mansions,
vineyards and a racetrack in Palo Alto.

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.099
Speaking of this race track, after the completion
of the railroad, horses became Stanford’s

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.099
obsession.

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.790
According to George T. Clark’s biography
Leland Stanford, it was actually Stanford’s

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.660
doctor’s orders that he take on supposedly
stress free hobbies like horse rearing and

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.660
racing.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.129
Because he apparently couldn’t do anything
half-speed, Stanford wanted to revolutionize

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.709
how trainers worked with racing horses.

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.359
In order to do this, he realized he needed
to figure out how horses ran – in the process

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:44.109
answering the age old question.

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:49.860
So, he turned to the best and most innovator
photographer in San Francisco, Eadweard Muybridge.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.950
Born in England in 1830, Muybridge moved to
the United States and became a bookseller

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.150
around 1852.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.810
Ultimately ending up in California, he was
moderately successful at this venture and

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.249
by the age of 30 decided he was ready for
something else.

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:05.430
He announced in the paper in 1860:

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.110
I have this day sold to my brother Thomas
S. Muybridge my entire stock of books, engravings,

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.110
etc.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.129
I shall leave for New York, London, Berlin,
Paris, Rome, and Vienna, etc…

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:21.290
However, on his way to start his grand adventure,
a fateful stagecoach crash in Texas resulted

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.290
in Muybridge being ejected from the coach,
at which point he smacked his head against

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.629
a rock, causing severe brain trauma.

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:32.430
When he awoke in a hospital some 150 miles
away, he noted that, “each eye formed an

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.209
individual impression so that looking at you,
for instance, I could see another man sitting

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:38.279
by your side.”

00:03:38.279 --> 00:03:42.090
After several months, he recovered enough
to return to England, but did not go on the

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.609
grand tour he’d previously planned, instead
spending the next six years in his native

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:47.609
land.

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:51.560
While the accident may have left him with
permanent brain damage, it also set the stage

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.579
for the career that would make him world famous.

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:57.951
You see, at some point during his lengthy
recovery period, according to Muybridge, one

00:03:57.951 --> 00:04:02.139
of his physicians suggested he take up the
relatively new field of photography.

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:06.769
Fast forward to 1872 and Muybridge was one
of the leading photographers in the world,

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.459
being vaulted to that world-wide fame after
shooting over 200 stunningly clear shots of

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.639
Yosemite Valley in 1868.

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:18.979
(An easy thing to do today, but in his time
an amazing achievement; beyond being exceptionally

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:23.840
difficult to capture such shots with any clarity
due to long exposure times, this also required

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.710
him to trek around the wilderness for several
months carrying all the equipment he’d need

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.450
to both take and develop the photos on the
spot.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.930
Once a location was chosen, he’d then have
to wait for just the right lighting and weather

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.530
conditions that would allow him to take the
expansive shots without blurring.)

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.060
Wanting the best, as previously noted, Stanford
approached Muybridge about helping him figure

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.980
out how exactly a horse runs.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.900
Despite Stanford’s suggestion that they
could do this by combining multiple real-time

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.180
photos in succession, Muybridge declared the
task impossible.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.669
The available technology of the day wouldn’t
allow it; exposure times were typically on

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:04.680
the order of 15-60 seconds, which was completely
unsuitable for capturing any motion whatsoever.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.360
Money talks, however, and Stanford was ultimately
able to convince Muybridge to take on the

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.240
project via offering him what ended up being
more or less an open ended budget.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.400
While the pair made significant progress on
this front over the next two years, including

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.530
managing to capture a very blurry image that
seemed to show a horse galloping with all

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.669
four legs in the air, in 1874 the project
was interrupted because Muybridge was arrested

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:30.770
for murder- a crime he happily confessed to.

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.550
wifeYou see, two years earlier he married
the 21-year-old (and 20 years his junior)

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:36.550
Flora Stone.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.349
(When he originally met Stone, she was already
married, with Muybridge paying for her divorce.)

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:47.419
Back to 1874, on April 15th of that year she
bore a son, Floredo Helios Muybridge.

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:51.330
Not long after the birth of the child, Muybridge
went to pay the midwife who delivered the

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.110
boy, Susan Smith.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.009
While there, Muybridge discovered a photograph
of his son.

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:00.030
On the back, it said “Little Harry” in
his wife’s handwriting…

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.630
When Muybridge saw this, he went ballistic.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.939
Under extreme duress, the midwife confessed
to Muybridge that Flora and one Major Harry

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:08.879
Larkyns were having an affair.

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:13.250
The midwife later recounted what happened
next, “When I told Muybridge of the affair,

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:14.830
he cried like a baby…”

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.000
He then asked her, “Who’s baby is that,
mine or Larkyns?”

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.479
She replied, “I do not know.”

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:24.099
She then told him she had seen his wife “on
the bed with her clothes down to her waist

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:26.139
and Larkyns sat on the bedside…”

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:28.630
Muybridge did not take the news well.

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.169
“In great agony of mind, he wandered about.

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:34.539
My opinion is when he left me he was insane.”

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:38.139
Directly after leaving the midwife, Muybridge
went home and collected his revolver.

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:41.620
He then took a train and then a horse and
carriage to Larkyns’ home.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.090
Arriving several hours after learning of the
affair, Muybridge knocked on the door.

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:49.570
According to the February 4, 1875 edition
of the San Francisco Chronicle, when Larkyns

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:54.879
answered the door, Muybridge said, “I am
Muybridge and this is a message from my wife,”

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:58.820
at which point he pulled out his gun and shot
Larkyns in the chest, killing him.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.690
Muybridge was subsequently arrested and, a
few months later, put on trial for murder.

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:07.870
At no point did he deny killing Larkyns, nor
did he himself claim he had been driven insane

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:08.870
when he killed him.

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.199
Quite the contrary, in fact; he felt he was
justified in the act.

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:17.330
In an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle
while in prison, Muybridge described his relationships

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:18.330
and motivations,

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.120
We never had any trouble to speak of.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.720
We sometimes had little disputes about money
matters, but they were not serious.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:29.340
I was always a man of very simple tastes and
few wants, and I did not spend much money.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:34.069
What I had left over after paying my little
expenses, I gave to her, but she was always

00:07:34.069 --> 00:07:35.069
wanting more.

00:07:35.069 --> 00:07:38.900
I could never see that she had bought anything
with it to speak of or imagine what she did

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:39.900
with it.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.530
We sometimes had little spats about money,
but nothing serious…

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:44.930
I loved the woman with all my heart and soul.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:49.160
And the revelation of her infidelity was a
cruel frustrating blow to me.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.240
Since the shooting I’ve been told many things
to which I was previously blind.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:57.330
Friends whom I should have expected to inform
me when they saw how I was being deceived

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:58.680
have now told me all.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.699
I did not desire to see her again.

00:08:00.699 --> 00:08:04.539
They may ransack my record as much as they
please, and I defy them to bring anything

00:08:04.539 --> 00:08:05.539
against me.

00:08:05.539 --> 00:08:07.090
I have no fear of the result.

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:11.800
I feel that I was justified in what I did
and that all right minded people would justify

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:12.939
my action.

00:08:12.939 --> 00:08:17.990
Of course, the law is the law and this sort
of vigilantism tends to not hold up well when

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:20.710
placed in the crucible of organized justice.

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:25.069
Luckily for Muybridge, the enormously wealthy
Leland Stanford still wanted his question

00:08:25.069 --> 00:08:27.340
answered and needed Muybridge to do it.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:32.209
Thus, Stanford hired a team of lawyers to
defend him, including C.H. King and W.W.

00:08:32.209 --> 00:08:33.209
Pendegast.

00:08:33.209 --> 00:08:37.669
They outlined their defense in their opening
remarks on February 3, 1875:

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:42.370
We claim a verdict both on the ground of justifiable
homicide and insanity.

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:46.360
We shall prove that years ago, the prisoner
was thrown from a stage, receiving a concussion

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:50.889
of the brain, which turned his hair from black
to gray in three days, and has never been

00:08:50.889 --> 00:08:52.450
the same since.

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:56.000
Ultimately the jury was not convinced that
Muybridge had been insane, not the least of

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.200
which because, as previously noted, in public
comments he himself didn’t seem inclined

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:04.130
towards the notion (though he never testified
officially in the case).

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:08.180
However, while the judge explicitly told the
jury that killing a man for having an affair

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:13.170
with one’s wife was by no means justifiable
murder as far as the law was concerned, the

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:15.120
jury didn’t agree.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.430
As noted in a contemporary report in the San
Francisco Chronicle,

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:22.560
The jury discarded entirely the theory of
insanity, and meeting the case on the bare

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:27.620
issue left, acquitted the defended on the
ground that he was justified in killing Larkyns

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.240
for seducing his wife.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:33.649
This was directly contrary to the charge of
the Judge, but the jury do not mince the matter,

00:09:33.649 --> 00:09:35.310
or attempt to excuse the verdict.

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:39.220
They say that if their verdict was not in
accord with the law of the books, it is with

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:43.790
the law of human nature; that, in short, under
similar circumstances they would have done

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:48.410
as Muybridge did, and they could not conscientiously
punish him for doing that they would have

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:49.680
done themselves.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:53.180
In the aftermath of the murder, Muybridge’s
wife would divorce him, but she became ill

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:56.389
and died about nine months after Muybridge
killed her lover.

00:09:56.389 --> 00:10:00.490
As for Florado, with his mother no longer
alive to care for him (and his supposed father

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:04.910
dead at the hands of Muybridge), Muybridge
unceremoniously put the poor boy in an orphanage,

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:07.250
though he did provide for his financial needs.

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:11.290
(It was later noted that the child grew up
to slightly resemble Muybridge, perhaps indicating

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:16.730
that he had indeed been his son and not Harry
Larkyns’ as Muybridge and his wife had thought.

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:20.120
Florado himself seems to have been inclined
towards the notion as when he died at the

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:26.290
age of 70 after being hit by a car, his tombstone
stated: “Florado Helios Muybridge, Apr.

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:32.630
16, 1874 – Feb. 2, 1944, Son of photographer
Eadweard James Muybridge”.)

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:36.130
Whatever the case, as for Muybridge, he traveled
throughout South America for about a year

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:39.920
before returning in 1876 to begin working
with Stanford again.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.920
With Stanford’s ample resources in hand
(the project ultimately costing about $50,000

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:50.149
or $1.14 million today), Muybridge invented
a new rapid shutter mechanism and more sensitive

00:10:50.149 --> 00:10:53.420
chemicals allowing for quick, clear exposure
of a galloping horse.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:58.269
And so it was that after many failed experiments
and ultimately some successful test runs that

00:10:58.269 --> 00:11:03.590
revealed the answer clearly, on June 19, 1878,
Muybridge and Stanford invited the press to

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:08.269
watch them officially capture something that
would change the way we looked at the world.

00:11:08.269 --> 00:11:11.899
On one side of the track was a white shed
filled with a dozen cameras, each containing

00:11:11.899 --> 00:11:16.850
two lenses to make two separate exposures
per camera (in case one didn’t come out

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:17.850
right).

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:20.140
On the other side was a white background to
increase contrast.

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:25.339
On the track itself was a series of 12 tripwires
spaced approximately 20-21 inches (30 cm)

00:11:25.339 --> 00:11:28.130
apart, with each connected to the cameras’
shutter mechanism.

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:29.130
Press surrounded the track.

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:33.390
At the far end, master trainer Charles Marvin
had the reins of one of Stanford’s race

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:34.390
horses.

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:35.690
With a gun blast, the horse took off.

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:39.520
In less than half a second after she had reached
the first trip-wire, the horse had tripped

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:43.320
all 12 of them, setting up a succession of
dropping shutters.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:47.279
Time at this point was critical as the shots
just taken had to be processed while the negatives

00:11:47.279 --> 00:11:52.290
were still moist, with only around 10-20 minutes
to develop the 24 total plates after taking

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:53.290
the shots.

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:57.020
Once Muybridge had done this in his little
mobile development studio, he put the pictures

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:58.680
out for the gathered people to see.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:03.160
It should be noted here that beyond the necessity
to develop the shots right away, it was particularly

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.060
critical for the press to see him do this.

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:09.580
You see, some past test photos Muybridge had
captured of a horse in full gallop had been

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:13.950
largely dismissed by many in the press as
forgeries, with some even going so far as

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:17.199
to mock his supposed shots in cartoon caricatures.

00:12:17.199 --> 00:12:20.709
Many people simply refused to believe that
it was actually possible to take a clear photo

00:12:20.709 --> 00:12:21.820
of a galloping horse.

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:26.320
Thus, Muybridge wanted the journalists to
see the horse galloping live and see him both

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:30.730
take the shots of it and develop the photos
in front of them so there would be no doubt

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:33.130
of their accuracy and his accomplishment.

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:36.670
As for the pictures themselves, they were
stunningly clear, with one witness to the

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:42.070
event noting you could even see “the threadlike
tip of Mr. Marvin’s whip… in each negative.”

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:45.480
Ultimately rough woodcuttings were made so
that the photos could be transferred into

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:52.480
newspapers for the public to see, with the
following result:The_Horse_in_Motion_high_resWhat

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:57.259
was revealed in the succession of photo proofs
is that, yes, horses did basically “fly”

00:12:57.259 --> 00:13:01.230
through the air when galloping, as, at one
point, all four of their hooves did leave

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:02.230
the ground.

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:05.970
What’s more, this happened when their hooves
were pointed inward as opposed to outward

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:10.660
like most speculated and what the majority
of artists up to this point had portrayed

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.690
when showing horses galloping.

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:16.780
Some famed artists of the day took the news
well, even subsequently contacting Muybridge

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:20.029
to help them make their future works depicting
horses more accurate.

00:13:20.029 --> 00:13:24.170
However, as was noted in the press, Muybridge’s
photos seemingly made a mockery of pretty

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:27.420
much all past artworks depicting horses moving.

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:32.380
So it’s perhaps not surprise that some artists,
such as famed sculptor Auguste Rodin (best

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:36.930
known today for his “The Thinker” sculpture),
went the other way, noting, “It is the artist

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:42.310
who is truthful and it is photography which
lies, for in reality time does not stop.”

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:46.040
Needless to say, Muybridge and Stanford’s
stunt was a rousing success.

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.480
But this was just the beginning.

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.820
Muybridge now had a way to film things in
natural motion.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:55.279
He quickly improved the technology, including
inventing an electromagnetic timer to control

00:13:55.279 --> 00:14:00.500
the shutters instead of trip-wires (allowing
for a shutter speed of 1/1000th of a second).

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:04.949
Beyond this, he invented what was more or
less the first movie projector in his zoopraxiscope,

00:14:04.949 --> 00:14:08.740
showing the first film of “The Horse in
Motion” in the fall of 1879 to Stanford

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:10.089
and a select group.

00:14:10.089 --> 00:14:13.700
As one reported noted of this first movie
screening, “Nothing was wanting but the

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:18.740
clatter of hoofs upon the turf and the occasional
breath of steam to make the spectator believe

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.620
he had before him the flesh and blood steeds.”

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:24.130
There was a problem in all this though.

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:27.750
Initially Stanford and Muybridge seemed the
best of friends and happy to credit the other

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:32.600
for their respective contributions in this
revolution of art and science- Stanford provided

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:37.230
the funds, focus, and staff, and Muybridge
did the inventing and capturing of the historic

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:38.230
images.

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:42.260
This mutual credit would all change, however,
with the publishing of a book by one of Stanford’s

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.000
friends, Dr. J.B.D.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.670
Stillman, titled The Horse in Motion, in 1882.

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:52.880
In it, the aptly named Stillman would show
around 100 drawings copied from Muybridge’s

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.620
photos, but without crediting Muybridge.

00:14:55.620 --> 00:15:00.290
In fact, Muybridge was only mentioned in passing
in the book as an employee of Stanford’s.

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:04.550
This was despite the fact that the book was
explicitly “Executed and Published Under

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:09.170
the Auspices of Leland Stanford” who knew
well Muybridge’s real contributions.

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:13.910
Beyond being offended at credit not being
given, this also cost Muybridge a prestigious

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:18.220
job and a fair amount of his reputation, at
least initially, in his homeland.

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.464
After witnessing several such films Muybridge
had subsequently made in a lecture he gave

00:15:19.464 --> 00:15:23.190
in Britain, the British Royal Society of Arts
offered him a rather lucrative contract to

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:26.009
film other animals and people in motion for
academic study.

00:15:26.009 --> 00:15:30.360
But when the book came out with no real mention
of Muybridge, the Royal Society retracted

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:34.560
their offer, thinking Muybridge was lying
about his contributions in the project.

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.880
Not only that, but they also accused him of
being a plagiarist.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.990
An academic paper Muybridge was attempting
to get published on the motion of horses mirrored

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:46.310
on several points what was written in Stillman’s
book, but with no credit given to Stillman.

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:50.459
Of course, the fact was that the work by Muybridge
had formed the bases for Dr. Stillman’s

00:15:50.459 --> 00:15:54.529
notes in the book, not the other way around
as the Royal Society now assumed.

00:15:54.529 --> 00:15:59.160
Muybridge was devastated, lamenting, “The
doors of the Royal Society were thus closed

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:04.170
against me and my promising career in London
was brought to a disastrous close.”

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:08.389
Muybridge would go on to not only sue the
publisher of the book, but Stanford himself,

00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:12.160
thinking Stanford was intentionally trying
to downplay Muybridge’s contributions to

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:16.959
take all the credit himself, as so many who
financed inventors have done before.

00:16:16.959 --> 00:16:20.440
Ultimately Muybridge lost the lawsuits, but
by this time the University of Pennsylvania,

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:24.970
who did not doubt Muybridge’s work, offered
to fund him in filming everything from birds

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:29.949
in flight to nude men and women doing various
things like carrying buckets, going up and

00:16:29.949 --> 00:16:33.240
down stairs, hitting baseballs, rowing boats,
dancing, etc.

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:37.709
(You can see some of these short films here,
here, and here.)

00:16:37.709 --> 00:16:41.420
The point of all this, at least as far as
the University was concerned, was to study

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:44.519
various complex body movements in slow motion.

00:16:44.519 --> 00:16:48.339
As for Muybridge, while he publicly lauded
the scientific merit of his work, he more

00:16:48.339 --> 00:16:53.160
revelled in the art of it all, and rightly
recognized how his work would influence artists

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.160
to come.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.519
Beyond the more obvious examples, with several
famed paintings in the subsequent decades

00:16:57.519 --> 00:17:02.000
just putting their own spin on one of Muybridge’s
stills, his books could be found on the desks

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.250
of many of the early animators in Hollywood
as they tried to accurately depict motion.

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:10.240
On top of this, Muybridge’s idea of what
is now sometimes called “bullet-time”

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.740
has been popular throughout the history of
cinema, perhaps best depicted today in the

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:15.240
original Matrix film.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:19.400
Long before that film (and many others before
and since) used the exact technique, however,

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:23.620
Muybridge was first- setting up a series of
cameras in a semi-circle around subjects,

00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:25.740
timed to take pictures as they moved.

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:29.720
In one such case, a nude Muybridge can be
seen swinging a pic-axe.

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:33.521
In the end, Muybridge, who viewed himself
as an artist rather than a scientist, ultimately

00:17:33.521 --> 00:17:38.140
made his money using his new technology to
aid science while hoping to influence art.

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:41.940
However, within a couple decades, the likes
of the Lumière brothers and Thomas Edison

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:45.590
(the latter of which who would consult with
Muybridge) would eclipse his work with their

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:49.620
own versions of this new type of technology,
advancing the field from something akin to

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:52.730
short animated gifs to lengthy productions.

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:56.380
This was an advancement Muybridge foresaw
and more, describing the future of what would

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:57.409
become cinema,

00:17:57.409 --> 00:18:01.490
In the not too distant future, instruments
will be constructed that will not only reproduce

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:06.809
visible actions simultaneously with audible
words, but an entire opera, with the gestures,

00:18:06.809 --> 00:18:12.010
facial expressions, and songs of the performers,
with all the accompanying music, will be recorded

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:17.780
and reproduced by an apparatus combining the
principles of the zoopraxiscope and the phonograph,

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:21.679
for the instruction and entertainment of an
audience long after the original participants

00:18:21.679 --> 00:18:22.929
have passed away.

00:18:22.929 --> 00:18:26.030
Despite his life’s work being largely in
the public eye, beyond initially having his

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:30.380
accomplishments somewhat usurped by Stanford
and Stillman, Muybridge’s role as one of

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:33.830
the father’s of film would be largely forgotten
by popular history.

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:37.570
To add insult to injury, after he died in
1904, even his own tombstone has his name

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:39.929
misspelled, inscribed “Eadweard Maybridge”.

00:18:39.929 --> 00:18:44.880
Stanford sunk a huge percentage of his fortune,
about $40 million (a little over a billion

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:50.070
dollars today), into creating the notable
Leland Stanford Junior University (commonly

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:53.770
called just “Stanford,” though it still
officially retains its original name).

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:57.820
As previously mentioned, this university was
named after his son who contracted typhoid

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:00.410
fever shortly before his 16th birthday.

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:17.690
He ultimately died of the condition shortly
thereafter in 1884.
