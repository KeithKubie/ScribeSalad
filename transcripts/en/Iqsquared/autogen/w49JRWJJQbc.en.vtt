was my interview with Kathy Newman and

was my interview with Kathy Newman and
 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.370
was my interview with Kathy Newman and
the reason that that propelled me to

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380
the reason that that propelled me to
 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.230
the reason that that propelled me to
success wasn't because I said something

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240
success wasn't because I said something
 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.239
success wasn't because I said something
provocative but because I refused under

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:12.249
provocative but because I refused under
 

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:13.770
provocative but because I refused under

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780
substantial duress to say anything
 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.080
substantial duress to say anything
provocative and so the part of the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090
provocative and so the part of the
 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.690
provocative and so the part of the
reason that I've become popular to the

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700
reason that I've become popular to the
 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.190
reason that I've become popular to the
degree that I have been is that I'm

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200
degree that I have been is that I'm
 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.749
degree that I have been is that I'm
actually very good at keeping my temper

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759
actually very good at keeping my temper
 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.569
actually very good at keeping my temper
under situations that would would would

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:24.579
under situations that would would would
 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:27.690
under situations that would would would
not under situations where there's

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700
not under situations where there's
 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.609
not under situations where there's
substantial reason not to let's say and

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619
substantial reason not to let's say and
 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.029
substantial reason not to let's say and
I would also say that the the good that

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039
I would also say that the the good that
 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:34.499

00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:38.889
might be done by the fact that people
 

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:40.649
might be done by the fact that people
are cutting them and making provocative

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659
are cutting them and making provocative
 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:42.449
are cutting them and making provocative
titles out of them and construing this

00:01:42.449 --> 00:01:42.459
titles out of them and construing this
 

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:44.940
