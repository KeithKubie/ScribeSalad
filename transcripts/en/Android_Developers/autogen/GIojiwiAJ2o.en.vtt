you are obviously working for games in
sides<00:01:25.680><c> you</c><00:01:25.920><c> would</c><00:01:26.070><c> know</c><00:01:26.900><c> okay</c><00:01:27.900><c> so</c><00:01:27.960><c> I'm</c><00:01:28.560><c> just</c>

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 align:start position:0%
sides you would know okay so I'm just
 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.580 align:start position:0%
sides you would know okay so I'm just
gonna<00:01:29.329><c> so</c><00:01:30.329><c> essentially</c><00:01:30.900><c> what</c><00:01:31.049><c> happens</c><00:01:31.079><c> with</c>

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 align:start position:0%
gonna so essentially what happens with
 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
gonna so essentially what happens with
these<00:01:31.770><c> games</c><00:01:32.040><c> is</c><00:01:32.280><c> that</c><00:01:32.700><c> one</c><00:01:32.939><c> of</c><00:01:33.060><c> these</c><00:01:33.180><c> games</c>

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 align:start position:0%
these games is that one of these games
 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.929 align:start position:0%
these games is that one of these games
is<00:01:33.659><c> actually</c><00:01:33.840><c> a</c><00:01:34.049><c> priority</c><00:01:34.500><c> today</c><00:01:34.650><c> still</c><00:01:35.520><c> it</c>

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 align:start position:0%
is actually a priority today still it
 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.359 align:start position:0%
is actually a priority today still it
represents<00:01:36.720><c> a</c><00:01:36.869><c> big</c><00:01:37.079><c> part</c><00:01:37.439><c> of</c><00:01:37.530><c> the</c><00:01:37.680><c> revenues</c><00:01:38.189><c> so</c>

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 align:start position:0%
represents a big part of the revenues so
 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.490 align:start position:0%
represents a big part of the revenues so
when<00:01:38.820><c> were</c><00:01:38.939><c> I</c><00:01:38.970><c> was</c><00:01:39.210><c> I</c><00:01:39.390><c> was</c><00:01:39.540><c> looking</c><00:01:39.810><c> at</c><00:01:39.930><c> old</c>

peak assumptions in the first case was

peak assumptions in the first case was

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 align:start position:0%
when the game was published and so we
 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.650 align:start position:0%
when the game was published and so we
are<00:03:14.459><c> going</c><00:03:14.640><c> to</c><00:03:14.730><c> look</c><00:03:14.970><c> at</c><00:03:15.180><c> games</c><00:03:15.390><c> that</c><00:03:15.599><c> they</c>

are going to look at games that they

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 align:start position:0%
were published four years or older and
 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.539 align:start position:0%
were published four years or older and
then<00:03:18.510><c> also</c><00:03:18.690><c> if</c><00:03:19.079><c> this</c><00:03:19.290><c> game</c><00:03:19.620><c> represents</c><00:03:20.310><c> a</c><00:03:20.370><c> top</c>

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 align:start position:0%
then also if this game represents a top
 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.520 align:start position:0%
then also if this game represents a top
priority<00:03:20.790><c> for</c><00:03:21.150><c> the</c><00:03:21.239><c> company</c><00:03:21.390><c> if</c><00:03:21.810><c> the</c><00:03:22.140><c> games</c><00:03:22.350><c> is</c>

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 align:start position:0%

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.410 align:start position:0%

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 align:start position:0%
driving most of the revenues then in
 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
driving most of the revenues then in
this<00:03:24.570><c> case</c><00:03:24.780><c> we</c><00:03:24.930><c> would</c><00:03:25.019><c> consider</c><00:03:25.380><c> an</c><00:03:25.680><c> outlier</c>

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 align:start position:0%
this case we would consider an outlier
 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.800 align:start position:0%
this case we would consider an outlier
so<00:03:26.579><c> we're</c><00:03:26.730><c> making</c><00:03:27.060><c> the</c><00:03:27.180><c> assumption</c><00:03:27.390><c> of</c><00:03:27.630><c> like</c>

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 align:start position:0%
so we're making the assumption of like
 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.870 align:start position:0%
so we're making the assumption of like

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
in the first game let's just fix
 

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.540 align:start position:0%
in the first game let's just fix
everything<00:20:41.390><c> that</c><00:20:42.140><c> we</c><00:20:42.260><c> did</c><00:20:42.440><c> wrong</c><00:20:42.680><c> at</c><00:20:42.950><c> one</c><00:20:43.190><c> go</c>

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:43.550 align:start position:0%
everything that we did wrong at one go
 

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:48.160 align:start position:0%
everything that we did wrong at one go
and<00:20:44.800><c> we</c><00:20:45.800><c> were</c><00:20:46.520><c> quite</c><00:20:46.880><c> experimental</c><00:20:47.870><c> with</c><00:20:48.020><c> it</c>

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:48.170 align:start position:0%
and we were quite experimental with it
 

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:50.110 align:start position:0%
and we were quite experimental with it
so<00:20:48.590><c> we</c><00:20:48.740><c> decided</c><00:20:49.100><c> that</c><00:20:49.370><c> instead</c><00:20:49.640><c> of</c><00:20:49.940><c> just</c>

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
so we decided that instead of just
 

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:52.750 align:start position:0%
so we decided that instead of just
making<00:20:50.360><c> the</c><00:20:50.780><c> first</c><00:20:51.470><c> this</c><00:20:51.920><c> is</c><00:20:51.980><c> the</c><00:20:52.070><c> second</c><00:20:52.520><c> game</c>

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
making the first this is the second game

making the first this is the second game
let's<00:20:53.150><c> experiment</c><00:20:53.690><c> a</c><00:20:54.020><c> little</c><00:20:54.260><c> bit</c><00:20:54.410><c> so</c><00:20:55.100><c> we</c><00:20:55.250><c> had</c>

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:55.400 align:start position:0%
let's experiment a little bit so we had
 

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.270 align:start position:0%
let's experiment a little bit so we had
an<00:20:55.520><c> idea</c><00:20:55.820><c> for</c><00:20:55.880><c> drive</c><00:20:56.270><c> ahead</c><00:20:56.420><c> sports</c><00:20:56.960><c> so</c><00:20:57.800><c> you</c>

00:20:58.270 --> 00:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
an idea for drive ahead sports so you
 

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:00.010 align:start position:0%
an idea for drive ahead sports so you
can<00:20:58.430><c> play</c><00:20:58.610><c> soccer</c><00:20:58.970><c> and</c><00:20:59.300><c> other</c><00:20:59.420><c> sports</c><00:20:59.780><c> with</c>

can play soccer and other sports with
 

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:02.920 align:start position:0%
can play soccer and other sports with
cars<00:21:00.350><c> so</c><00:21:00.890><c> we</c><00:21:01.070><c> made</c><00:21:01.250><c> it</c><00:21:01.280><c> first</c><00:21:01.640><c> an</c><00:21:01.940><c> event</c><00:21:02.480><c> in</c><00:21:02.750><c> the</c>

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:02.930 align:start position:0%
cars so we made it first an event in the
 

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:05.890 align:start position:0%
cars so we made it first an event in the
original<00:21:03.410><c> game</c><00:21:03.710><c> and</c><00:21:04.640><c> when</c><00:21:04.820><c> we</c><00:21:04.970><c> told</c><00:21:05.240><c> fans</c><00:21:05.540><c> that</c>

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:05.900 align:start position:0%
original game and when we told fans that
 

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:08.950 align:start position:0%

summer is over soccer is going away
 

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.840 align:start position:0%

then<00:21:09.260><c> they</c><00:21:09.410><c> started</c><00:21:09.710><c> begging</c><00:21:09.920><c> us</c><00:21:10.250><c> to</c><00:21:10.400><c> bring</c><00:21:10.640><c> it</c>

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:10.850 align:start position:0%
then they started begging us to bring it
 

00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:13.180 align:start position:0%
then they started begging us to bring it
back<00:21:11.120><c> and</c><00:21:11.450><c> we</c><00:21:11.990><c> said</c><00:21:12.200><c> well</c><00:21:12.590><c> you</c><00:21:12.710><c> can</c><00:21:12.860><c> play</c><00:21:13.070><c> it</c>

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:38.450 align:start position:0%
turned out to be even more skilled game
 

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:42.180 align:start position:0%

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:15.350 align:start position:0%
change the UI UX added a saga map and
 

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:18.220 align:start position:0%
change the UI UX added a saga map and

destroyed and nearly killed the game and
 

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:30.610 align:start position:0%
destroyed and nearly killed the game and
then<00:22:26.570><c> we</c><00:22:27.020><c> also</c><00:22:27.200><c> went</c><00:22:27.590><c> all-in</c><00:22:28.360><c> with</c><00:22:29.360><c> AR</c><00:22:29.900><c> so</c><00:22:30.440><c> we</c>

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:30.620 align:start position:0%
then we also went all-in with AR so we
 

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
then we also went all-in with AR so we
made<00:22:30.800><c> a</c><00:22:30.830><c> game</c><00:22:31.130><c> called</c><00:22:31.160><c> drive</c><00:22:31.790><c> ahead</c><00:22:31.940><c> mini</c><00:22:32.270><c> golf</c>

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:32.570 align:start position:0%
made a game called drive ahead mini golf
 

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:35.590 align:start position:0%
made a game called drive ahead mini golf
so<00:22:33.350><c> if</c><00:22:33.830><c> we</c><00:22:34.010><c> have</c><00:22:34.190><c> car</c><00:22:34.490><c> gladiators</c><00:22:35.210><c> this</c><00:22:35.480><c> is</c>

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
so if we have car gladiators this is
 

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.500 align:start position:0%
so if we have car gladiators this is
what<00:22:35.750><c> they</c><00:22:35.900><c> do</c><00:22:35.960><c> in</c><00:22:36.230><c> their</c><00:22:36.350><c> free</c><00:22:36.650><c> time</c><00:22:36.680><c> and</c>

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:37.510 align:start position:0%
what they do in their free time and
 

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:39.910 align:start position:0%
what they do in their free time and

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:39.920 align:start position:0%

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:35.930 align:start position:0%
making two big changes but we had
 

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:38.320 align:start position:0%

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:38.330 align:start position:0%

started doing live ops which is a really

great place to change the rules of the

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:44.990 align:start position:0%
game and and we see what works there and
 

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
game and and we see what works there and
then<00:23:45.170><c> bring</c><00:23:45.380><c> it</c><00:23:45.620><c> into</c><00:23:45.770><c> the</c><00:23:46.070><c> actual</c><00:23:46.970><c> game</c><00:23:47.060><c> and</c>

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:48.610 align:start position:0%
then bring it into the actual game and

then bring it into the actual game and

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:25.940 align:start position:0%
engagement rate by 50% and
 

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:29.370 align:start position:0%
engagement rate by 50% and
our<00:24:26.030><c> engagement</c><00:24:26.330><c> is</c><00:24:26.720><c> one</c><00:24:26.930><c> of</c><00:24:27.020><c> our</c><00:24:27.170><c> key</c><00:24:27.830><c> KPIs</c>

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:29.380 align:start position:0%
our engagement is one of our key KPIs
 

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
our engagement is one of our key KPIs

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:32.410 align:start position:0%
so the lessons we learned here was that
 

00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:34.900 align:start position:0%
