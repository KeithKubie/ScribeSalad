 (upbeat music)

00:00:03.369 --> 00:00:04.504
- Well, it's been a big week for

00:00:04.537 --> 00:00:06.472
 viral video celeb meltdowns.

00:00:06.505 --> 00:00:08.474 size:88% position:44%
  First, there was
  Chloe Grace Moretz

00:00:08.507 --> 00:00:11.444 size:88% position:44%
 reaming out newcomer, Brian
 Butler, from The Downloader

00:00:11.477 --> 00:00:13.579 align:start size:88% position:13%
 and then our good
 buddy, Kevin Donnelly,

00:00:13.612 --> 00:00:17.116 align:start position:0%
  got the business from none
  other than Kristen Bell

00:00:17.149 --> 00:00:19.052
 on the red carpet of The Boss.

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:20.520
 Ooh, that was nasty.

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:22.688
 A lot of people say
 this could be the end

00:00:22.721 --> 00:00:24.757
for the legendary correspondent.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.492 size:84% position:42%
  We invited Kevin
  over this morning

00:00:26.525 --> 00:00:28.194 size:88% position:44%
 to set the record straight.

00:00:28.227 --> 00:00:29.062
Is here here, what's up?

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:30.063
- Yeah.

00:00:30.096 --> 00:00:31.264 size:84% position:42%
  - Did he show up?

00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:33.633 size:84% position:42%
  - Seacrest, (claps) Ryan.

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.235
 Seacrest, do this thing, man.

00:00:36.268 --> 00:00:37.470
 Come 'ere, give me some love.

00:00:37.503 --> 00:00:39.505
We're brothers, we're brothers.

00:00:39.538 --> 00:00:41.340
 - You and your tighty
 whities have a seat.

00:00:41.373 --> 00:00:42.341
- This is funny.

00:00:42.374 --> 00:00:44.477 size:84% position:42%
  I was there and I stood--

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.445
 - Could you please sit
 on the chair though?

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:47.146
- I'm so tired.

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:48.514 align:start position:0%
 - [Mario] Okay, but can you
 please sit on the chair?

00:00:48.547 --> 00:00:50.283 size:84% position:42%
  - I've been up all night.

00:00:50.316 --> 00:00:52.485
 Your bed is so uncomfortable.

00:00:52.518 --> 00:00:54.687
 (sobs)

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.490
 (upbeat music)

00:01:03.162 --> 00:01:04.530
- Hey guys, look at me.

00:01:04.563 --> 00:01:07.366 align:start position:0%
  - Jesus, Brittney, I've
  never seen you run before.

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:08.201
 What happened?

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:10.536 size:88% position:44%
  - Kevin got fired.

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:14.207 size:88% position:44%
 (Man in Suit gasps)

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.609
- That is so super sad for him.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.744
 - Is he okay?

00:01:18.777 --> 00:01:20.179 size:88% position:44%
 - I don't think so.

00:01:20.212 --> 00:01:23.216
 This morning at 6:00
 am, he tweeted no.

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.187
- We got it, lots of Os.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.321 size:88% position:44%
 - This is not good.

00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:30.322 align:start position:0%
 - You know what, I'm starting
 to feel bad for the guy.

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:34.727
I mean, they're probably
gonna replace him today.

00:01:37.296 --> 00:01:39.232
- I've gotta go, like,
right now to a meeting.

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:43.569
 - I just started my period,
 so I've gotta call my agents.

00:01:43.602 --> 00:01:45.771
 - You're both the worst humans
 ever, you know that, right?

00:01:45.804 --> 00:01:47.240
 Deca, you too?

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:49.242
- [Deca] I have dreams.

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:51.544
 (rock music)

00:01:51.577 --> 00:01:53.379
 - Things are not fucking good.

00:01:53.412 --> 00:01:55.081
I'm the one who's dominated this

00:01:55.114 --> 00:01:57.483
whole frickin' town for 28 years

00:01:57.516 --> 00:01:59.585 size:88% position:44%
  and now I'm in my
  car eating Cheetos

00:01:59.618 --> 00:02:03.223
 'cause I can't fuckin'
 get my head straight.

00:02:06.258 --> 00:02:08.361 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - I'm sorry, I'm being
 so rude right now.

00:02:08.394 --> 00:02:09.595
- No, it's okay.

00:02:09.628 --> 00:02:12.632
- Okay, so, like, was
this movie fun to make?

00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:14.233 align:start position:0%
  - Yeah, it was really fun.
  - [Brittney] Oh my god.

00:02:14.266 --> 00:02:15.501
That's so great.

00:02:15.534 --> 00:02:18.137 size:84% position:42%
  Oh my god, you're
  so interesting.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.505 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - That's why I love
 this character,

00:02:19.538 --> 00:02:20.506
(cell phone vibrates)
you know, George Hotty.

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:21.707 size:88% position:44%
 - Oh, wait.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.442 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - He's more than just
 a judge, you know?

00:02:23.475 --> 00:02:24.810 size:88% position:44%
 - Yes, yes.

00:02:24.843 --> 00:02:26.179
 Just, hello?

00:02:26.212 --> 00:02:27.446
 - Got some good news.

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:30.316
- Yeah, no, no, no, no,
not busy at all, uh-huh?

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.654
- Okay, so what are you
wearing under the robe?

00:02:34.687 --> 00:02:35.788 size:88% position:44%
  I'm asking you a question.

00:02:35.821 --> 00:02:37.390 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - You should probably
 put that down.

00:02:37.423 --> 00:02:40.426
 - I can't, I wish I
 could, I wish I could.

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.496 size:88% position:44%
  - Oh my gosh, this
  is really awkward.

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:46.399 align:start position:0%
  - [Brittney] I'm so sorry.
  - Where's my publicist?

00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:48.668
 - Yeah, I can come in
 right now, so sorry.

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:50.369 size:84% position:42%
  Yeah, yeah, I'll
  be there, uh-huh.

00:02:50.402 --> 00:02:52.138 align:start size:88% position:13%
 On my way, all
 right, just a second.

00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:54.440 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Are we under
 attack or something?

00:02:54.473 --> 00:02:55.741
 (rock music)

00:02:55.774 --> 00:02:58.444
 - I should be in there
 talking to Matt Bomer.

00:02:58.477 --> 00:03:00.446
 Where's the frosting?

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:01.380
 Oh yeah, I got some.

00:03:01.413 --> 00:03:03.316
 (sobs)

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.626
 - I know what you're
 on your phone about.

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:14.794 size:84% position:42%
  I figured it out.

00:03:14.827 --> 00:03:16.796 align:start size:88% position:13%
 It's the Kevin
 Donnelly job thing.

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.098
 - Oh no, I'm just
 watching this video.

00:03:19.131 --> 00:03:22.101 align:start position:0%
 It's got a panda with a
 little paper jet pack on it.

00:03:22.134 --> 00:03:23.469
 - Let me see.

00:03:23.502 --> 00:03:25.538
 (both laugh)
 - Look at him.

00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:27.473 align:start position:0%
 Wait, watch it, watch that.
 - [Matt] Oh my god.

00:03:27.506 --> 00:03:29.542
 (both laugh)

00:03:29.575 --> 00:03:32.411 size:88% position:44%
  - Oh my god, it's so cute.

00:03:32.444 --> 00:03:33.546 size:88% position:44%
 - That's good, man.

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.414
 Do it again.

00:03:35.447 --> 00:03:37.216
 - Hey, can you keep a secret?

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:38.384 size:88% position:44%
 I just got off the
 phone with my reps.

00:03:38.417 --> 00:03:40.086 size:88% position:44%
 Apparently, it's down to me

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:42.755
and one other person for
Kevin's job at The Fix,

00:03:42.788 --> 00:03:44.557
so I could get the job and then,

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.459
I launch my line of green juices

00:03:46.492 --> 00:03:50.263 size:84% position:42%
  and then my red juices
  and then my beige juices.

00:03:50.296 --> 00:03:51.464 size:88% position:44%
 - I never had the
 chance to tell you,

00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:54.300
but I really admire you
and your work ethic.

00:03:54.333 --> 00:03:55.167
 - Thank you so much.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.535
That is so nice.

00:03:56.568 --> 00:03:59.505 size:88% position:44%
  You know, I never actually
  had an opinion about you,

00:03:59.538 --> 00:04:02.775
 but after you said that nice
 thing about me, I like you.

00:04:02.808 --> 00:04:04.176
 - Thank you?

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:05.578 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Yeah, I'm not
 going back in there.

00:04:05.611 --> 00:04:07.647
These people are fuckin' crazy.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.083
 Just have the car pick me up
 on the side entrance, okay?

00:04:11.116 --> 00:04:12.418
 Aw, Jesus.
 (rock music)

00:04:12.451 --> 00:04:14.220
 Let me call you back.

00:04:17.456 --> 00:04:19.592 size:84% position:42%
  Hey there, Kevin.

00:04:19.625 --> 00:04:20.760 size:84% position:42%
  Hey, wow.

00:04:20.793 --> 00:04:22.094 align:start size:88% position:13%
 You look like
 someone shit in your

00:04:22.127 --> 00:04:24.196 align:start size:88% position:13%
cornflakes this
morning, man, you okay?

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:26.065
 - Just, just, can you
 leave me alone, okay?

00:04:26.098 --> 00:04:26.733
- Okay.

00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:30.470
 Here.

00:04:31.403 --> 00:04:33.072
 Give me the Cheetos.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.809
 - If you're here to give me a
 pep talk or try to cheer me up

00:04:36.842 --> 00:04:38.411
 or anything like that,
 it's not gonna work.

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:39.245
 - It's not a pep talk.

00:04:39.278 --> 00:04:41.147 size:84% position:42%
  I just, I wanna
  tell you a story.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.648 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I was born in Saint
 Louis, Missouri

00:04:42.681 --> 00:04:45.618 align:start position:0%
 (dramatic music)
 and ever since I can remember,

00:04:45.651 --> 00:04:47.186
all I wanted to do was be a part

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:48.554
 of the storytelling process.

00:04:48.587 --> 00:04:50.389
 It changed me life and
 so I went to New York

00:04:50.422 --> 00:04:53.225
 and I said, "No, Dad,
 these are my dreams."

00:04:53.258 --> 00:04:55.528
I had to answer phones
at an advertising agency

00:04:55.561 --> 00:05:00.099 align:start position:0%
  called Mesner Vituri
  Burger Macknamay Schmeder.

00:05:00.132 --> 00:05:01.100 size:84% position:42%
  Can you say that?

00:05:01.133 --> 00:05:01.734 size:88% position:44%
 - I can't say that.

00:05:01.767 --> 00:05:03.135 size:88% position:44%
  - Neither could I.

00:05:03.168 --> 00:05:05.104 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I found out that I
 had a voice, you know?

00:05:05.137 --> 00:05:08.708

00:05:23.088 --> 00:05:26.158 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Yeah, that's when
 I realized that

00:05:26.191 --> 00:05:28.060
 Judge Hotty's perfect
 for the whole family.

00:05:28.093 --> 00:05:30.029 size:84% position:42%

00:05:30.062 --> 00:05:30.763
- Oh, it's not.

00:05:30.796 --> 00:05:32.431 size:84% position:42%
  It's not relevant to you.

00:05:32.464 --> 00:05:34.667
I never got a chance to
talk about myself today

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.736 align:start size:88% position:13%
 with all you
 self-involved pricks

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:38.704 align:start size:88% position:13%
 and your cell phones
 and running out.

00:05:38.737 --> 00:05:40.673 size:88% position:44%
 - 'Cause I'm the one that's
 kind of having the crisis

00:05:40.706 --> 00:05:42.308
 right here, right now.
 - [Matt] Oh my god.

00:05:42.341 --> 00:05:43.175
 I'm so sorry.

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:44.510 size:88% position:44%
 - I'm the one in my
 car eating Cheetos.

00:05:44.543 --> 00:05:45.778 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Matt] I'm sorry, man.
- With frosting.

00:05:45.811 --> 00:05:47.413 size:88% position:44%
 - I'm in junket mode today.

00:05:47.446 --> 00:05:50.649
I'm just, oh god, I'm
all about my narrative.

00:05:50.682 --> 00:05:52.218
You, this is easy, man.

00:05:52.251 --> 00:05:55.054
 You need to stop being
 a garbage human being.

00:05:55.087 --> 00:05:55.688
You have a girl?

00:05:55.721 --> 00:05:56.589 size:88% position:44%
  You have a guy or?

00:05:56.622 --> 00:05:57.790
- I had a girl.

00:05:57.823 --> 00:05:59.125 align:start size:88% position:13%
She's in there and she's
trying to leave me.

00:05:59.158 --> 00:06:01.127
- So, go get her, tiger.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.428
 But you should shower first.

00:06:02.461 --> 00:06:03.462
 You smell like shit.

00:06:03.495 --> 00:06:04.463
- Do I, do I smell bad?

00:06:04.496 --> 00:06:06.332
- Literal shit.

00:06:06.365 --> 00:06:07.466 align:start size:75% position:25%
 (Kevin sniffs)
 It's bad.

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:08.401
- I do kind of smell like poop.

00:06:08.434 --> 00:06:10.002
- It's permeating the whole car.

00:06:10.035 --> 00:06:13.172 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I smelled it before
 I even got here.

00:06:13.205 --> 00:06:14.340
(romantic music)

00:06:14.373 --> 00:06:15.341 size:88% position:44%
 - Brittney.

00:06:15.374 --> 00:06:17.510 size:88% position:44%
 - Oh my god, Kevin?

00:06:17.543 --> 00:06:20.646
 - Listen, Matt Bomer just
 told me the meaning of life.

 Please take me back, please
 forgive me for everything.

00:06:23.048 --> 00:06:25.484 size:84% position:42%
  I promise I won't
  disappoint you.

00:06:25.517 --> 00:06:27.520
- Let me think about it.

00:06:30.722 --> 00:06:31.524
Fuck no.

00:06:31.557 --> 00:06:33.526
 (phone rings)

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:34.460
 - [Kevin] Is that you?

00:06:34.493 --> 00:06:35.594
- Hello, this is Brian.

00:06:35.627 --> 00:06:36.695
 Yes.

00:06:36.728 --> 00:06:37.696
 What?

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:38.731 size:88% position:44%
  Of course.

00:06:38.764 --> 00:06:40.132 size:88% position:44%
  Thank you so much.

 - [Kevin] Who was
 that phone call from?

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.570
- I just got the job at The Fix.

00:06:45.437 --> 00:06:46.338
- What?

00:06:46.372 --> 00:06:48.107
 What, that's gotta be
 some kind of mistake.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.475
- It is like a mistake, I think.

00:06:49.508 --> 00:06:50.709 size:84% position:42%
  - The goddamn patriarchy.

00:06:50.742 --> 00:06:52.678
- I'm so happy for you.

00:06:54.413 --> 00:06:57.283
- Hey, enjoy your eight minutes.

00:06:59.585 --> 00:07:02.121
 (upbeat music)

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:06.025 size:88% position:44%
 - Hey, Kev.

00:07:07.459 --> 00:07:09.161 size:88% position:44%
  They let you back, oh wow.

00:07:09.194 --> 00:07:10.296 size:84% position:42%
  Okay, hi.

00:07:10.329 --> 00:07:12.164
 - Hey, listen.

00:07:12.197 --> 00:07:13.566 size:88% position:44%
  Guess what didn't
  just go very well?

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:14.767
 - What, what's that?

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.402 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Me, coming back in
here and trying to give,

00:07:16.435 --> 00:07:17.770
 you know, being the
 tiger and everything.

00:07:17.803 --> 00:07:20.039 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Thanks for the shitty
 fucking advice.

00:07:20.072 --> 00:07:21.607
 - Woah, woah, buddy.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.677 align:start position:0%
 - You know, my career, I
 thought it was fucked before.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.445
Now, it's super fucked.

00:07:26.478 --> 00:07:28.481 size:88% position:44%
 - I was just trying to come
 at you from the heart, man.

00:07:28.514 --> 00:07:30.349 size:88% position:44%
  - [Kevin] I just got super
  fucked and you know what?

00:07:30.382 --> 00:07:32.017
It was because of your
shitty stupid fucking--

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:33.152
- Take it easy with that finger.

00:07:33.185 --> 00:07:34.353 size:88% position:44%
  - Stick a fuck up.

00:07:34.386 --> 00:07:35.688 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Get the fucking
 thing away from me.

00:07:35.721 --> 00:07:36.655 size:84% position:42%
  Stand up.

00:07:36.688 --> 00:07:38.357
 I'm gonna go outside.

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:41.160 size:88% position:44%
 I'm gonna be by my car and
 you're gonna come out there

00:07:41.193 --> 00:07:45.364
 and I'm gonna show you what
 it's like to be super fucked.

00:07:50.769 --> 00:07:52.102 size:88% position:44%
 - Were you rolling?
