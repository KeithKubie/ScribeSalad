00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.969
 

00:00:22.969 --> 00:00:24.510
This is a three
dimensional structure

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.866
of a protein called lysozyme.

00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:31.280
It represents the
order of nature.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.840
And I feel awed
when I look at it.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.425
It's an enzyme that's in our
tears and saliva and mucus,

00:00:39.425 --> 00:00:43.100
and it helps us fight bacteria.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.500
And knowing this three
dimensional structure

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.810
helps us to understand
the mechanism of action

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.090
of this enzyme,
and therefore how

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.250
it helps fight
bacteria in our bodies.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.330
 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.490
Unfortunately, the
size of the molecule

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.570
is such that it's
far too small for us

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.129
to see under a light microscope,
or with our naked eye,

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.630
because the wavelength of
light is much, much larger

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.660
than the size of
this tiny molecule.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.080
For that reason, we
have to use radiation

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.180
that's much smaller
in wavelength.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.840
And we use X-rays to
look at these molecules.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:30.160
 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.010
These are protein crystals.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.090
Locked within each crystal
are millions of protein

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.625
molecules, all arranged in an
ordered, grid-like structure.

00:01:39.625 --> 00:01:43.250
 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.150
By firing X-rays at these, and
measuring how they scatter,

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.050
we can work out the
molecular structure

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.650
of nearly any
crystallised sample.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.720
It's through this method,
known as X-ray crystallography,

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.390
that some of the most
important biological structures

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.740
have been obtained.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.760
from the double helix of DNA
to numerous proteins, vitamins,

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.430
and drugs.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.770
But getting from a
crystal to something

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.350
like this, the structure,
is not at all trivial.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.470
And it can take a long time
to grow a suitable crystal.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:25.540
 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.060
Now we're in the Protein
Production and Purification

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.050
lab, because before we can
set up crystallisation trials,

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.190
we need to produce enough
protein for that process.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.000
We do this by genetically
modifying E. coli bacteria,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.590
which then acts as
a little factory

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.770
to produce our protein in
a large flasks of broth,

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.550
which we incubate.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.480
Once that's happened,
we break open the cells,

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.590
extract the protein,
and then purify it,

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.500
ready for the
crystallisation process.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.200
 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.190
So why do we need to grow
crystals of our protein

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.200
molecules before we can
shine X-rays at them

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.520
and try and find the three
dimensional structure of them?

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.970
Well, if we imagine that this
string of beads is a protein

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.390
molecule made up of 20
different amino acids--

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.650
different colour of beads--
that are found in nature,

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.040
this folds up in a very complex,
complicated manner in the three

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.590
dimensional shape, like this.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.020
And if we look at one of these--
a true biological molecule

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.980
here, a real one-- what
this metal model represents

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.530
is a string through the beads.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.610
And you can see it
starts at this end,

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.410
and it follows a pretty
torturous path going around

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.530
here, that you'd never
imagine when you just

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.630
look at the string
of amino acids.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.180
And the other end of
it comes out here.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.500
Now it turns out that
if I take a tube here

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:57.390
with my protein in it, that
I've purified and prepared,

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.970
there's millions and millions
of protein molecules in there.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.820
And if I shine X-rays
at it, the X-rays

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.810
will scatter off in all
sorts of random directions.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.550
And I won't get any
information about the shape

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.640
of the molecule within the tube.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.640
However, if I can get the
protein molecules to line up

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.690
in an ordered array--
such as in a crystal,

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.860
where they're all lined up in
the same orientation-- when

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.630
the X-rays scatter
from the crystal,

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.340
then I can get
enough information.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.980
The signal is strong enough for
me to get the three dimensional

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.270
structure of the protein.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:37.090
 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.910
We've now come down to
the crystallisation lab

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.100
to look at how we
crystallise proteins.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.140
In this Petri dish, I've got
some supersaturated sodium

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.700
acetate.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.800
And that means that there's
so many molecules crowded

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.680
in this solution, it's almost
not holding the molecules.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.770
And it wants to solidify.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.090
And if I hit it
with a spatula here,

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.900
you can see that
it crystallises.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.690
We get a fantastic pattern as
it crystallises across the dish.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:17.010
 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.880
Essentially, this is what we
try to do with our proteins.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.510
Which is to produce a
supersaturated solution

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.050
of the protein, and we dehydrate
in a very controlled manner.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.930
 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.190
The proteins we work
on here unfortunately

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.370
can be sometimes really
difficult to crystallise.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.380
So we load small volumes of the
protein into trays like this,

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:42.830
with different additives.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:48.260
But we have robots
that help us do that

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.015
by pipetting small
volumes into these trays.

00:05:51.015 --> 00:05:53.750
 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.940
Once we have the tray with
the protein and additives in,

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.880
we take it around to
this crystal hotel which

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.650
holds the tray for several weeks
at four degrees centigrade.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.200
And also monitors whether
we have crystals or not

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.880
by photographing the
tray drops regularly.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:18.820
 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.630
But that's only part
one of the story

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.690
because once we finally manage
to grow a protein crystal,

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.610
we then have to take
it for X-ray analysis.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.370
And from the data
we obtain, we try

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.310
to generate a structure
of our protein molecule,

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.645
such as this one of lysozyme.

00:06:34.645 --> 00:06:39.770
 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.520
But the protein structures
we work on today

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.330
are far more complex.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.980
And they can produce very
small and delicate crystals.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.100
So to study them,
we have to take them

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.080
to extremely powerful
X-ray sources

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.553
at specialist facilities, such
as the Diamond Light Source.

00:06:55.553 --> 00:06:59.970
 

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:01.700
It's only once we get
our crystals there

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.780
that the next stage of our
journey can truly begin.

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:11.710
 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:13.880
It's the most expensive
and sophisticated

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.620
scientific facility
ever built in the UK.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.770
The instrument in
this building can

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.010
produce X-ray beams
powerful enough

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:27.450
to peer right into the atomic
heart of all kinds of matter.

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:47.776
