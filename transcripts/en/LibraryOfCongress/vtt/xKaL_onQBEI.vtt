&gt;&gt; Peter Vankevich: OK.

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:05.970
This is the last very wonderful
day here at the Kitchen Stage.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.080
And I do want to once again
thank our ASL interpreters

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.940
who have done a wonderful job
since 10 o'clock this morning.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.240
Stand up, stand up.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.980
[Applause] It is a very
important duty here.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.750
So, all right, I have
Ms. Eun Yang from NBC,

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.650
big anchor for our
local TV here.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.510
Welcome.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.420
[ Applause ]

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.720
&gt;&gt; Eun Yang: Thank
you so much, Peter.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.020
Good evening, everyone.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.440
What a crowd, look
at all these people.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.650
It's awesome to see so
many people in attendance

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.350
of the National Book Festival.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.250
I was an avid reader.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.740
Now, I'm a "try to steal time
whenever I can while I'm driving

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.040
my children around" reader.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.500
And I love this event so much.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.260
It's my eighth year at the
National Book Festival.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.030
I look forward to coming every
year because authors are treated

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.570
like rockstars as they should
be and I get to meet some

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.010
of my favorite authors
including the one I'm

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.490
about to introduce tonight.

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.270
Thank you so much to the
Library of Congress for hosting

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.700
such a fantastic event.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.560
This conversation is sponsored
by the James Madison Council.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.060
So even before Reese Witherspoon
fought for the rights to adapt

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.420
"Little Fires Everywhere" for TV
and brought in Kerry Washington

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.910
to co-star in the show
even before it was a summer

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.790
of Asians, the August of Asians,

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.950
Celeste Ng set our
consciousness ablaze

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.120
with her powerful stories.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.800
I think we've run
out of accolades

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.140
to describe her writing.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.640
After reading her books, I'm
left with so many questions

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.600
about her characters but more
about myself and my life.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.490
And I think that's why
her books are so amazing.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.820
And today, she'd sit down with
fellow talented writer Rumaan

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.680
Alam, the author of "Rich
and Pretty" and "That Kind

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.250
of Mother", who's also an editor
of the New York Times books,

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.020
so two big deals up here on
stage, ladies and gentlemen.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.160
I'm very much looking
forward to this conversation,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.510
Celeste Ng and Rumaan Alam.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:11.590
[ Applause ]

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.540
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Hearing our
credentials laid out like

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.900
that makes me feel really
happy for our Asian mothers.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.140
I feel like the Asian mother out
there is like, yes, you know?

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.020
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: Do they know how
to do that because there's--

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.320
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: That's fair.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.170
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: I sent
my mom, at one point,

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.060
a picture of the New York Times
best-seller list with me on it

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.740
and her reply letter was,
great, going down to brunch

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.090
in a few minutes, love you.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.540
And that was what it was.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.020
And I feel like--

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.910
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: I just-- I was
in California not that long ago

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.110
and I met a friend's aunt
who is an Asian mother.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.270
And my friend introduced me, she
said, oh, this is my old friend,

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.570
Rumaan, he wrote two books.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:51.870
And she was like, mm-hmm.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.690
And she said, oh, he is also an
editor at the New York Times.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.050
And she said, oh,
the New York Times.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.510
[Laughter] I'm supposed
to warn the audience

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.330
that when we ask questions,
you're going to be on camera,

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.630
you're going to be recorded.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.940
So, if you are in the federal
witness protection program,

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.530
please do not come
up to the microphone.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.520
Celeste and I will-- Celeste
will take some questions,

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.640
we'll give you a heads-up a
few minutes before the end

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.950
of the program.

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.010
I'm not going to bother
introducing Celeste

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.800
because I would love to
see by a show of hands

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.030
who in this room has read
one or both of her books?

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.820
Yeah, OK. So, a few weeks ago,
Penguin Random House tweeted

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.880
that you had a million copies
of your new book in print--

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.740
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: Yeah, I don't
want to impugn them but I feel

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.120
like that has to
be a math error.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.270
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: I don't
know, I don't know.

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:39.830
I-- You think it's fake news

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.360
but you just saw
everybody raise their hand.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.610
So I'm not going to waste
our time talking too much--

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.820
in too much detail about,
you know, the plot specifics

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.330
or the mechanics
behind these two books.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.280
But you are-- your
book came out when,

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.100
earlier this spring--
this fall, right?

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.400
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: No,
it came out at fall,

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.620
came out September of 2017.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:59.920
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Wow, really?

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.220
Gosh, I haven't seen
you in a long time.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.720
So, from the distance of,
you know, quite a while now,

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.540
how does it-- how does your
relationship to the book

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.870
that you have spent the past
few months touring about change?

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.200
And then how does your
relationship to your first book,

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.030
how has that changed
over that time?

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.300
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: I think the best
analogy that I have for sort

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.040
of the relationship that I
have with both of my books is,

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.270
it's a little bit like a
parent who has got a child

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.020
and the child has grown up and
is theoretically going away

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.040
to college and then comes back
and moves back into your house

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.410
and keeps asking you
to do their laundry,

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:37.920
do more of their things,
and you're like, please,

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.100
like I just-- I need
to just move on.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.550
And I'm really-- I still
love my books but I also feel

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.240
like I need to let them
live their own lives,

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.750
if that makes any sense.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.820
But I'm really happy to keep
getting to talk about the books

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.700
because the characters
are still very real to me.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.810
And I still think about them
periodically and so it's sort

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.580
of nice that they're
still calling in a way.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.260
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: It's
a complicated balance,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.750
I would imagine, to be a writer
of a book that is so successful

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.500
because you were
sort of liberated

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.800
by the success of the book.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.140
But then as you said, you're
still doing the book's laundry.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.020
So how do you make the time--
how do you make the time now

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.370
as an artist to keep writing
and to keep thinking and to have

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.920
that sort of sustained
quiet focus that you need

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.220
to do the work of a novelist?

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.830
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: That's been a
real sort of learning process

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.740
for me, is figuring out
how do you, you know,

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.030
turn down the volume on the
things that you need to do

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.280
that you want to do to
support the work you've done

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.800
and to keep making new stuff?

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.300
And one way that I
did in honesty is

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.190
that I set myself
really unrealistic goals

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.040
and then I tell my friends these
goals and I tell my agent--

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.470
our agent these goals as a
sort of way to be accountable.

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:43.910
So I'll say, OK, by
the end of this summer,

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.460
I'm going to have a
draft of a new book.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.250
And they'll look at me
and go, OK, good, do that.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.680
And I don't usually actually
hit those goals but it's a ways

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.390
of sort of reminding myself
that these are the things

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.890
that I still have to do.

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:01.410
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Because
I guess the question is,

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.110
what is your job as a writer?

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.420
Is your job to be a
public person and to tweet?

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:07.840
I think you like to use Twitter.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.840
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: Most
of the time, yes.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.200
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Or is your
job to sit down in isolation

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.990
and quiet and have your
sort of family life

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.440
and your quiet working
focused life?

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.740
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: Yeah,
and this is a question

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.040
that I've been asking myself,

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.790
especially over the
past few months.

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:26.310
I feel like my job first is to
write my books, but I realized

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.520
that these other things are
part of my job too, like to come

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.550
and do public events like
this, to go to schools and talk

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.470
to students, sometimes to write
essays or to talk on Twitter.

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:37.840
And where the line is, is going
to be different for everybody.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.260
But it's a thing that I'm
sort of feeling out what feels

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:42.860
like work that I want to do.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.580
So I keep answering it by
coming down to what am I trying

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.310
to accomplish with
any of the work?

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:52.800
For me, it tends to be, I want
to be an advocate for empathy.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.250
I want to be an advocate for
people, imagining what it's

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.480
like to be other people,
and for holding open space

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.630
for contradiction
and for grace basis.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.510
And so then anything that I
can do that fits in that space,

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.720
I think of as being my work.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.060
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: A
worthy use of your time.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.450
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: We said we
were going to be light.

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:10.750
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Oh
I'm sorry, you guys.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.050
We should talk about
something fun.

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:13.350
OK, we'll lighten up.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.670
So, you're two books
into a career,

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:17.310
you're still a very young woman.

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:21.310
Are you conscious of
having a territory

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:22.790
as a writer that is yours?

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.380
Can you see a pattern
between the two books?

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:26.820
Or are you still
too close to them

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:28.820
to even define those patterns?

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:30.120
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: I
think I'm too close

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.420
to them to figure that out.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.290
I think other people are doing
a better job frankly of sort

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:35.020
of seeing the connections
between my--

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.320
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: All
right, do you want me

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.620
to just tell you what they are,

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:38.920
because I wrote them
down for you?

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.220
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: Yeah, I
was like-- You're fishing.

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.520
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Do you want me

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.820
to mansplain them
to you, Celeste?

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.120
I'm happy to.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.420
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: Rumaan,
please tell me

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:46.720
about what my work is about.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.790
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Well, I was
thinking about place with both

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:52.330
of your books which is
a significant factor

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:53.630
in both of the books.

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:55.500
And I just said I wasn't
going to do too much summary

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.490
but Celeste's first
book is called

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:58.790
"Everything I Never Told You".

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:03.730
It is the story of the sort
of questions around the death

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:07.180
of an adolescent in
a biracial family

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.440
in what I would maybe call

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.700
like ex-urban Ohio,
more than suburban--

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.000
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: Yes,
a small town.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.300
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Like a
small town, a college town--

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.240
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: I think I said it
was halfway in between Cleveland

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.480
and Toledo, because there's
not a lot between there.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.290
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: I
went to Oberlin

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:23.350
so I was picturing
Oberlin the whole time.

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:24.750
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: A lot
of people have asked me

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.050
if it's sort of based
on Oberlin.

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:27.940
And it's not based on Oberlin
specifically but that sort

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.240
of thing, where it's a sort

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.780
of self-contained
little college town.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:34.310
It's not on the-- It's not
attached to a city of its own.

00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:35.610
It's a sort of--

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:36.910
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Right.

00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:38.280
But it feels very much of Ohio.

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:43.610
And Celeste's new book, "Little
Fires Everywhere" is much more

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:46.780
difficult so summarize but it is
the story of a suburban family

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:49.630
and their entanglement with
another suburban family

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.800
in Shaker Heights,
Ohio, which is sort

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.780
of the prototypical
American suburb.

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:57.460
And so, I was thinking about
the suburbs and I was thinking

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:01.910
about Ohio and wondering
if you feel like, you know,

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:03.210
that's where you're from.

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.990
But is that your subject
or are you surprised

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:07.850
that someone might say
that it is your subject?

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:09.150
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: I'm
not surprised.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.110
I think that's accurate so
far based on these two books.

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:13.890
I think I keep finding myself
returning to the suburbs

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:16.650
because we kind of look at our
own past a lot of the times

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:20.510
to sort of figure out how we
became the people we became.

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:22.300
And I'm very much a
product of the suburbs.

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:26.270
You know, my parents wanted
a lawn and good schools

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:28.460
and a grocery store
that had a parking lot.

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.690
I live in Boston where grocery
stores don't always have parking

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:33.490
lots, which just
boggles my mind.

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:36.530
But you come from New
York, so yeah, same.

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:39.850
But so, there's something
about this suburban world

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:41.150
that really fascinates me.

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:42.450
And I feel like part of it is

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:45.560
that the suburbs are maybe
quintessentially the place

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.330
where you're trying
to have it all.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.370
You're trying to have the
best parts of the urban world

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:52.310
and the best parts of not
being in the city, right?

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:54.620
You get to have all the culture
and you're close to the city

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.030
but you don't have to
deal with the crowds

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:57.680
and the traffic, right?

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.720
You get to have the lawns
and a little space around you

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.960
but you still have neighbors
and community where it's harder

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.260
to have out in the world.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.890
And I would find myself coming
back to this idea about trying

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:11.270
to have it all because that--

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:14.190
the flip side of that is
what did you miss out on?

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:16.150
What are you not getting?

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:18.230
And that's sort of one of
the themes that I think runs

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:20.740
through both of the
books, is sort of--

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.930
what are your questions about
the life that you missed out on

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:27.480
and the choices you didn't take,
the path that you didn't follow?

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.440
Those are the questions that I
ask myself a lot, and that seems

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.740
to be what comes up a lot.

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:35.490
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: By rigorously
focusing on the suburbs,

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:37.680
you kind of exposed
the larger world,

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:41.900
the world just beyond the
physical borders of this place

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.670
that is seemingly ordinary
and orderly, right?

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:45.970
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: I
think that's it.

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:47.470
I mean, I think we have
an idea in our minds

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:48.920
about what the suburbs
look like,

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.220
what they're supposed
to look like.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:52.740
We have an idea about the
people who might live there.

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:55.720
And by trying to zoom in
on that a little bit more,

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.650
I want to sort of expose
what that says about us

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:03.240
as a wider society, what
are we striving for,

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.330
because I think the suburbs are
sort of seen often as this place

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:09.080
of striving, that you are
striving to better yourself.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.380
You're striving for position.

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:13.680
You're striving for all these
things, what that says about us

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.670
and sort of our values
and where it is

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.800
that we think we're
supposed to be.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:22.090
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: I think when
we use the word suburb now,

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:24.900
it can sound kind of
demeaned or smaller.

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:28.470
But I think about sort
of the great golden age

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:31.780
of television narratives
like "Leave It to Beaver",

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:33.290
in which the suburb was sort

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:36.540
of like the paramount
American existence.

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:39.210
And the suburb as a
territory for a writer

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:41.780
of fiction has been
rich material

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:43.080
for writers like John Cheever.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.990
Like it is a serious subject
and a serious territory

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:51.100
that maybe we don't hear that--
the term itself doesn't have

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:53.050
that connotation any longer.

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:54.870
And one of the things
that I most

00:11:54.870 --> 00:12:03.310
like about the Celeste Ng
suburb is you very cannily

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:08.650
and subtly talk about race
and other kinds of difference.

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:11.320
And it's always a tricky thing
with a writer who is a person

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.130
of color to say like, talk to me
about being a person of color,

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:16.300
and talk to me where
that is in your work,

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.990
because that's reductive,
and your work is

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:21.270
about a lot more than that.

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:24.510
Having said that, I want
you tell me about it anyway.

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.030
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: That's
also-- It is a part of that.

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:27.770
I mean, the work is about race,

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:29.800
and that is part
of what it's about.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.400
Earlier, I was sitting
in the back

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.010
when Andrew Sean Greer
was talking, and he talked

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:35.920
about how he was at school and
he will come up and say like,

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.040
so I never met a
gay person before.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.340
What's that like?

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:41.160
You know, and it's sort
of a funny question

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:45.330
but it's also underneath that is
an honest desire to learn more

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:47.650
about someone who's maybe had a
different experience than you,

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:49.640
and I think that's admirable.

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.640
There's a moment in
"Everything I Never Told You",

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.180
in my first novel, in which one
character asked another like,

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:55.730
you know, so, you
know, you're the only--

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:58.370
you know, you're the only person
who's like you in this community

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:00.680
that are one of the few Asians.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.590
And he says, what's that like?

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:05.370
And she doesn't really now
how to answer that exactly.

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:10.750
So, I mean, my experience
of it has been it's a lot

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:14.220
like what I believe the
experience of not being a writer

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.420
of color is like, plus a
whole bunch of other things

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:19.940
that we get to think about that
a lot of other people don't.

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:21.900
And I think that's where
we start talking about sort

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:23.200
of like questions of privilege.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.180
What are the things that
you never have to worry

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:27.630
about because they're
not a part of your world

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:29.500
where they're a part of mine?

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.980
We talked about Twitter.

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:33.820
And one of the things that,
you know, Twitter is known for,

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:39.840
I think, is being a-- I'm a
looking for a polite word.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.140
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: A cesspool?

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:42.740
Is that a polite word?

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:46.010
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: I should say
a space of contention maybe,

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:47.310
that is the place to put it--

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:48.870
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: What
a diplomat, Celeste.

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:51.380
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: It's a place
where I think that, you know,

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:53.380
because people can
be sort of anonymous

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:55.500
and you're disconnected from
people, people can say a lot

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.570
of things that they
wouldn't otherwise say.

00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:01.210
And it's been an interesting
experience to be a woman writer,

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:03.400
and then a woman
writer of color,

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:07.020
and then who's now gotten
something of a large profile

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:10.600
to just sort of see what kinds
of assumptions people make

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:15.260
about me, you know, and what it
is that they think I'm saying,

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.990
and what it is they think
I'm supposed to be doing.

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:22.060
This-- I think about these
sorts of things a lot honestly

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.720
because there's--
we have this idea

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:29.270
that there can only be one
writer of any particular kind.

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:31.700
And so, there's this-- I wrote
an essay a long time ago called

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:35.070
"Why I Don't Want to Be the
Next Amy Tan", which I meant not

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:37.750
at all as a disrespect to Amy
Tan, but that I wanted to push

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:40.930
against this idea that we could
only have one Chinese-American

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:42.230
woman writer--

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:43.530
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: At a time.

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:44.830
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: -- at a time.

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:46.130
And so, if someone else was
going to come in and want

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:47.890
to be a Chinese-American woman
writer, they were going to have

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:50.330
to basically like knock
Amy Tan off her pedestal.

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:53.460
And I would like her just
to stay and keep writing.

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:57.090
And I think this is one of the
things, I think, that writers

00:14:57.090 --> 00:15:00.210
of color face a lot, is that
this question of representation.

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:02.840
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: But what's so
startling about that is that,

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:05.720
particularly with "Little Fires
Everywhere", although it--

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.500
of course it talks about race
and those of you in the room

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.070
who have read it will understand
the ways in which it engages

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:14.300
in that conversation,
in summary,

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.400
when you describe what the
book is about, it is a book

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:20.320
about a wealthy white
family with four children

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.830
in the suburbs of
Cleveland, Ohio.

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:25.820
So, you are not a white person

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:29.400
but you have written
on this subject.

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.700
Obviously, you know
what you're doing.

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:32.300
Obviously, you're doing
that with some intention.

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:33.870
Can you explore--
Can you explain

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:35.780
to me what that intention is?

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:37.080
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: Yeah.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.380
I think I was asked in
an interview recently

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:43.320
like why write about people
of color in relation to sort

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:44.620
of the larger white community,

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:45.920
which I think is a
really valid question,

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.480
and one I haven't been
asked in that form before.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:51.510
And my answer was
something like, well,

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:54.700
there's definitely a value, I
think, to writing about sort

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:56.000
of your own community.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.420
You know, a marginalized
community for me,

00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:01.260
it would be Chinese-Americans or
women or Chinese-American women,

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.150
because there's a value
in telling those stories.

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:05.410
But the thing is that we
don't exist in a vacuum.

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:08.630
And, you know, I have
always grown up in places

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:12.110
where I'm in the minority.

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:15.870
And I think there's a value in
sort of holding those things

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:18.670
up together and saying,
this is the context

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:20.180
in which this experience
is happening.

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:23.770
I think if you are a writer of
color for example and you write

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:26.920
about just this one
community in isolation, first,

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:28.260
I'm trying to imagine
how that would happen.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.210
I'm trying to imagine how
you would write a story

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:34.340
about any family of color
and not include any other--

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.600
you know, any other, you know,

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.990
any part of the larger
sort of white community.

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:40.290
But second, I think
there's always--

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:44.250
there's a danger than can happen
where people go to those sorts

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:46.230
of books as sort of
like a literary tourism,

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:48.340
where they're like, I'm going
to read this and I'm going

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:51.810
to learn a lot about
this community.

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:54.470
And then I'm going to close the
book and it will be like that's

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:56.790
when I get on the plane and
I go back to my own life.

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:59.350
And I think there's a value in
being asked to sort of think

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:02.550
about how these communities
engage with each other.

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:05.540
And so one of the things that I
wanted to write about in writing

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:10.000
about my hometown, Shaker
Heights, was how the families

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.420
that live in this area look at
people who are from outside.

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:16.040
And then this is something
that you have dealt

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:19.360
with in your own writing too,
because in both of your novels,

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:22.300
you also write people who
are not-- you know, there's--

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:24.380
it's not a Rumaan like stand-in,

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:28.460
there's no direct
you in the book.

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:29.760
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Yeah.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.250
In some ways, I think
that the very convention

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:37.050
of a literary novel is kind of
a white place, because reader--

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:38.790
writers like you
and I have grown

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:40.740
up reading a certain
kind of text.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:44.520
And yes, there was the Amy
Tan book that came along.

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:45.970
And then prior to Amy Tan,

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:50.410
there was Maxine Hong
Kingston and, you know--

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:51.710
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: Betty--

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:53.010
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Right.

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:57.500
And there is a lineage
there, but I was reading,

00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:01.250
and I'm sure you were reading
the classics that everyone read,

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:02.550
you know, like there
was this like--

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:04.920
the common literature
is what I was reading.

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.240
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: Yeah, my
mom was very into classics

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.800
and very into like Newbery--

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.150
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: A very
Asian mom of course.

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:12.330
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: -- very into
Newbery winners, so she would--

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:13.630
every time the Newbery
winner came out--

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:14.930
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: She's
read this one,

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:16.230
it's the best one, Celeste, yes.

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:17.530
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: -- everybody
[inaudible] this thing

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:18.830
on it right there.

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:20.130
But so it's true.

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:21.430
I mean, I realized that I
grew up with this very sort

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:23.480
of white perception of the
world, which is, you know,

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:25.570
I was reading things like
"The Boxcar Children",

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:28.210
"Little Women", and "The
Five Little Peppers",

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:31.610
and Frances Hodgson Burnett,
you know, "A Little Princess".

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:35.030
Very British, my mom grew up in
Hong Kong and so was educated

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:37.700
in the British school system and
so read a lot of British books

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:40.100
which she then remembered
and wanted to give to me.

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.400
And so that's--

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:42.700
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Did
you read Enid Blyton.

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.000
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: I did
read Enid Blyton.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.300
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: My parents
also grew up in sort of like--

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:46.600
The British really,
they fucked everything

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:47.900
up in the whole planet.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.900
But, you know, like
there is like a tradition

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.930
of anglophone children's
literature inside all

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:57.280
of these other world literatures
now because of the colonial--

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.800
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: And it spreads
because you read what--

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:01.060
you know, you read that and then
you kind of grow up thinking

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:03.600
about that and you think that's
sort of the empathy you have.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.550
And I think about--
there's this great essay

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:10.020
about the White Cliffs of Dover
in which, you know, they were--

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:11.350
it talks about sort of the--

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:13.620
wanting to sort of fight
against that received image

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:14.920
of like how the world
is supposed to be.

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:18.030
And so it was sort of a tricky
territory for me to want to,

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:21.100
you know, like-- so I'm
writing about a white family.

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:24.200
And people have pointed out, you
know, a lot of the characters

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.880
of color are moved to the sides.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.330
One of the main characters

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:31.380
of color is this
Chinese-American baby who's

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:34.060
getting adopted by
a white family

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:36.670
and her Chinese-American
mother who wants her back.

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:39.890
And they're two of the only
characters who aren't at the--

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:41.600
they're not centered
in the narrative,

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.820
but they're at the
center of the plot.

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:48.680
And I did that deliberately
actually because I wanted to--

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:51.600
people keep asking, well,
why didn't you ever let the,

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:55.000
you know, the birth mother, why
doesn't she got a lot of point

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.820
of view, only a little
at the end?

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.120
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: You know,
what you're supposed to say

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.520
when people say that is,
why don't you write a book?

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:01.820
[Laughter]

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:03.120
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: Well,
and she can--

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.420
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: But
please finish it.

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:05.890
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: I mean-- But
my thought was, the thing is,

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:07.570
I think it's really easy
when you read a book

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:10.110
and you see characters who are
not like you just say, well,

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:11.410
that's about them, right?

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:12.710
I'm over here and
they're over there

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:15.850
and there are these very
clear differences between us.

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:18.630
It's a lot harder when
you see yourself in some

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:21.950
of the characters to sort
of distance yourself.

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:25.750
So, you know, the book is
not just for people who live

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:28.250
in the suburbs with wealthy
people, white people.

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:31.820
But if you feel a kinship to
any of those things, you go, oh,

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:34.610
this suburb reminds me a
little bit of my hometown,

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:36.060
even if it's different
in these ways.

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:39.210
And then suddenly, you're
in this space where you have

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:41.340
to identify with these
characters and you have

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.590
to ask yourself questions,
would I act like that?

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:46.300
Do I act like that?

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:47.600
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Yeah.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:48.900
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: You know,
how am I different?

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:50.200
Where do I stand?

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.470
I mean, that I think is the
real purpose of any art really,

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:56.420
is to sort of ask you to figure
out where you stand in relation

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:57.720
to the world and
ask you to figure

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:01.250
out what your values are
compared to the values

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:02.850
of the characters in the book.

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:04.590
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: It is
a very clear choice,

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:07.230
to my thinking anyway, in
"Little Fires Everywhere"

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:11.290
that the one character who is
nominally closest to Celeste Ng,

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:15.310
the human being, the Chinese
woman who is a mother,

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:18.930
is very much to the
side in the pot.

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:23.090
And that sort of-- To me, that
is a very rich window into,

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:25.270
you know, who you
are as a person

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:27.240
and what it must have been.

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.520
It feels like an
autobiographical tell even

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:33.010
though I know that you're
not like the woman--

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:35.960
this character in the text is
sort of a lower class person--

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:38.960
a working class person who is
really going through this sort

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.240
of dire circumstance that
I know you did not go

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.540
through personally.

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:45.780
But it feels very much informed
by how you probably saw yourself

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:47.740
in the context of
Shaker Heights, Ohio.

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:49.180
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: And it's
interesting too that you--

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:50.790
and you asked the
question earlier about sort

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:52.660
of what are the themes
of the book.

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:54.110
When I started writing
the second book,

00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:55.710
I was really nervous
because I was thinking

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:57.990
like the first book I
wanted to write about sort

00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:00.880
of Asian-American
issues and touch on race,

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:04.340
and I realized I was doing it
sort of from the inside-out.

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:06.930
The first novel has
to do with the family.

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:09.630
Most of the action takes
place within the house.

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:11.230
It's a multiracial family

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:13.840
where the father is
a Chinese-American,

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.200
the mother is a white American,

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.150
and then they have
three mixed-race kids.

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:18.660
So it's-- I intentionally
set it up as sort

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:21.310
of a claustrophobic sort of
thing because I wanted the story

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:24.180
to be inside, so to speak.

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:26.020
And with the second book,
I said, I want to write

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:27.910
about these same issues but
I want to write about it

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:32.710
from the outside-in and so,
to instead put the focus

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:36.070
with the white characters
essentially to then be looking

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:40.050
at these questions of race
and privilege and all of that.

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:41.350
For me, I mean, they--

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:44.600
I see them as books that are
tackling similar issues but just

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:45.900
on opposite directions.

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:47.670
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Do you feel
like you're allowed to write

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:48.970
about anything you want?

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:52.920
Or do you feel like a response--
Do you feel a responsibility

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:54.220
to address these subjects?

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:56.300
And it's hard-- This
is a tough question.

00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:57.870
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: Yeah,
this is a big question.

00:22:57.870 --> 00:22:59.170
I don't know the
answer honestly.

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:00.890
I mean, I think am I allowed
to write about anything?

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:02.190
Yes, I think.

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:03.490
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: I mean,
obviously Penguin is going

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:04.790
to pay you for--
Everybody raised their hand

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:06.090
when they said they've
read the book, so.

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:07.610
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: Well, I think--
I mean, I think the question

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:09.200
of permission is a big one,

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.980
because this is a discussion
that's going on now.

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:14.070
There's a movement within
the literary community

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:16.520
that I think has a lot of valid
points in which people want

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.870
to talk about, you know, sort
of writing their own stories.

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:20.980
And that story-- We
should be getting stories

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:23.280
that are told by
their own voices.

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:24.580
And I think there's
something to that.

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:26.850
I mean, you are allowed to
write anything that you want.

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:30.580
Your job is also to imagine your
way into people who are not you.

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:33.580
And so, there's-- again,
there's sort of a tension

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:36.000
between those two things.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.340
For me personally, I
write about the things

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:41.010
that I think about the most.

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:43.870
And so that tends to be parents
and children and this question

00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:47.760
of legacy and history and
background, what gets said,

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.930
what gets passed down from
generation to generation,

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:53.840
and whether you can actually
be different from your parents.

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:56.680
I'm reaching the age in my
life now where I'm realizing

00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:00.330
that I'm turning into both of
my parents and not in the ways

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:02.610
that I expected either in like
completely different ways.

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:07.670
And I'm also-- Because I'm still
a daughter and I am a mother,

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:10.250
I am also trying to figure out,
what am I passing onto my kid?

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:13.500
What do I want you to have
that I had and I value

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:14.800
and I think would
be good for you?

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:17.600
And what are the things that
I don't want to pass onto you?

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.750
I know you're also a
parent of small children

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:22.640
and these are the questions that
I think about a lot at night.

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:23.950
And that's what comes
into the book.

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:25.250
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Yeah.

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:26.710
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: So for me,
those questions are always tied

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:30.060
up in questions of
race and gender

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:32.180
because I'm an Asian-American
woman.

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:33.810
And that's the experience
that I've had.

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:36.660
And so, in terms of what
I feel allowed to write,

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:38.050
I could write about anything.

00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:40.740
But what I think I'm
going to be good at,

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:44.250
what I think I have something
that I want to figure out,

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:48.250
because for me writing
is always from a place

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:51.680
of not understanding towards
understanding a little better.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.600
And those are the questions
that I'm trying to understand.

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:54.900
And that's why I
keep coming back.

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:56.200
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: I mean, these
are fertile territories.

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:58.000
It's not like you're saying,
I can only ever write novels

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.660
about one episode
of Seinfeld, like--

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:00.960
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: Exactly.

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:02.260
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: And that's
all I've got to commit

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:03.560
to for the rest of my career.

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:04.860
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: Its-- Yeah.

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:06.160
I mean--

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.460
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: You're
talking to me it has--

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:08.760
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: When
we say we're writing

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:10.060
about only parenting and, you
know, race in the suburbs,

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:11.360
that's a pretty big
thing to write, you know?

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:12.660
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: You mentioned
own voices and this brings

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:13.960
up an interesting question,
or interesting to me anyway.

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:18.850
But do you think there is
the same moral sensitivity

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:21.740
when you are writing across the
difference of race through--

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:24.690
towards whiteness as there
would be if you were writing

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:27.870
about being Latina or
writing about being black?

00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:29.170
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: That's such
an interesting question.

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:34.720
So this movement, Own Voices, is
sort of the idea that primarily,

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.020
stories about sort

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:37.320
of marginalized group
should be written

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:38.670
by people within those groups.

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:41.870
Somebody in the signing line
came to me at the very, very end

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:44.900
and said, I have this
burning question about

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:46.200
"Little Fires Everywhere".

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.500
And the question is, I
think, probably the one

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.270
that I have been asked the
most often about the book,

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:53.690
which is about the ethnicity of
Mia and Pearl, who are a mother

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:56.650
and daughter in this story
who come in from out of town.

00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:57.950
And they said, you know,

00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:00.040
basically like what
is their ethnicity?

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.840
Are they white or are
they people of color?

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:03.140
What are they?

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:05.380
And the truth is, since you're
all here, I'm just going

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:06.960
to confess to all of you.

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:09.560
The truth is that when I
started writing the book,

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:13.320
I thought I wanted them
to be people of color.

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:16.270
And I thought, well, I don't
want to make them Asian

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:18.570
because I knew there was going--
the book was going to center

00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:22.310
around this trans-racial
adoption of an Asian baby.

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:24.700
And it seemed like that
would make the loyalties too

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:26.000
clear-cut, right?

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.300
Like well, people
would say, well,

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:29.190
of course the Asian
woman is going to side

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:31.830
with the Asian mother
keeping the Asian baby.

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:36.850
But I didn't feel like I knew
enough to write the experience

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:39.590
of a black woman
or a Latina woman.

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:40.890
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Right.

00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:42.190
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: I
felt like I wasn't--

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:43.490
Honestly, I wasn't
going to do enough--

00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:44.790
a good enough job
and I didn't feel

00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:46.090
like that was my story to tell.

00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:48.500
And so I wrote the two
characters thinking about them

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:51.850
as a white mother
and a white daughter.

00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:55.620
And I love that the
TV adaptation is going

00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:57.000
to star Kerry Washington as Mia.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.460
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Gosh, no.

00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:00.020
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: So she's going
to be starring as a black woman.

00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:02.060
And I love that it's going
to raise these questions,

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:03.360
because I don't know
the answer to that.

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.310
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Well,
thanks for nothing, Celeste.

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:06.610
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: I know.

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:07.910
This is a long way--

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:09.210
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: You're
supposed to know the answer.

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:10.510
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: This was a long
way of dodging the question.

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:12.930
I think the answer comes under
maybe the best writing advice

00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:16.120
that I've ever gotten which
is that you can do anything

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.600
that you want to as long as
you can get away with it.

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:19.900
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Yeah.

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:21.810
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: And I think
how-- so how do you--

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:24.030
the question then is, how do you
know if you got away with it?

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:25.330
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: How do you know?

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:26.630
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: And I think it's
if you'd asked people who have

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:29.290
that experience and they say,
yeah, you got it or you didn't,

00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:31.670
you listen to them, right?

00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:34.270
Obviously, there is no
one black experience just

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:35.760
like there's no one
Asian experience,

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.690
there's no one anything
experience.

00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:41.040
But I think that part of
your job is to write--

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:43.050
in writing any characters,
you write as best

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:45.120
as you can, as truly as you can.

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:49.210
And if people tell you, I didn't
believe that, it didn't match

00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:53.030
up with my experience, then you
have to take that seriously.

00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:54.330
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Yeah.

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:55.630
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: Yeah.

00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:56.930
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Yeah.

00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:58.230
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: It's a
sort of giant like feeling

00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:59.530
around in the dark process
that I think we do as writers.

00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:00.830
But with the added benefit
of, you know, race being a lot

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:02.320
of things that we trip
over in this darker room.

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.620
Yeah.

00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:04.930
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: And you just
don't know until it's done,

00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:06.230
which is the challenge.

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:07.530
We have about 15 minutes left.

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:09.120
And I know a lot of you are
going to have questions.

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.860
So go ahead and starting
thinking

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:13.550
of really good questions
that are not comments

00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:16.640
and that are not requests for
Celeste to read your new book.

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:19.320
And I'm going to ask to
you one more question

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:22.190
because you mentioned Amy Tan
and you mentioned the idea

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:24.140
that there can be
one person of color,

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:27.270
one sort of representative
from a group

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:30.550
in the imagination at a time.

00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:34.510
And I have noticed and I'm
sure you have noticed a sort

00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:38.070
of Celeste Ng effect in
the fiction marketplace

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:40.570
and you laugh but I know that
you know what I'm talking about

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:41.870
and I know that this summer

00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:44.370
in particular has been a
really robust time for debut

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:48.600
of literary novels by women
of Asian descent generally,

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:49.900
not Chinese specifically.

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:52.940
There's sort of like a slew
of different kinds of books,

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:54.870
Crystal Hana Kim's
book, Lucy Tan--

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:56.170
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: Somebody
earlier described it

00:28:56.170 --> 00:28:58.090
as like we're having a Korean
women moment, and I was like,

00:28:58.090 --> 00:29:00.740
I hope they have
more than one moment.

00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:02.470
But I know what you mean.

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:05.440
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: And I
want to hear your-- like--

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:07.670
I'm not making this up.

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:09.940
Like this is something that
you've observed yourself

00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:13.430
and I'd love to hear you talk
about what that means to you.

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:15.620
I mean, that's like an-- I
think that's really testament

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:17.200
to something really
exciting, and I'd love

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.500
to hear what you thing--

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:21.070
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: I mean, I have
complicated feelings about that.

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:25.180
So, we'll try not to make
this into a therapy session.

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:29.530
I-- On the one hand,
I am thrilled to--

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:34.070
that there are more young
Asian-American women writing,

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:35.370
that there are more
Asian voices,

00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:37.900
that there are more just
frankly more diverse voices.

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:39.760
I was really happy
to see Tommy Orange,

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:42.820
who's a native writer whose book
hit the New York Times list.

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:45.580
You know, I think there
are really exciting writers

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:48.910
that are writing stories
that traditionally, I think,

00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:50.520
have been held up by
publishers like, we don't know

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:51.820
if people will buy that.

00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:53.880
And I feel like now, we're
seeing that people will buy that

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:55.550
and read it, and
these are good books.

00:29:55.550 --> 00:30:01.240
So if I've had anything to do
with that, I'm really happy.

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:04.390
Ages ago, somebody
said to me that being

00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:07.150
in the writing world is like
a lot of people fighting

00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:10.720
over one very, very small piece
of cake and then you realize

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:15.310
at a certain point that actually
there is not even any cake,

00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:16.820
[laughter] which is
sort of sadly true.

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:21.480
But my thought about that is
that then our job has to be

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:24.950
to make more cake for other
people, that if, you know,

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:26.680
if you're saying that, you
know, there's only so many seats

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.390
at the table, then I feel
like when you get a seat,

00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:30.300
your job is to try and
pull out more chairs.

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:32.260
And I honestly do believe that.

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:34.480
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: And I do think
of you as a writer who has--

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.670
you know, I think Celeste
is being pretty humble here.

00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:38.980
But I think of you as someone

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:42.100
who has very actively supported
the careers of younger writers,

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:44.660
not just writers of Asian
descent or writers who happen

00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:48.360
to be Asian women like
you, that you are very--

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:51.590
you see the responsibility
that you have as a writer

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:53.380
who has enjoyed some
degree of success,

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:57.260
and you seem very invested
in passing that on.

00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:58.560
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: Yeah, and I am.

00:30:58.560 --> 00:30:59.860
I mean, this is where
I would feel that I'm

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:02.830
like a Marvel superhero dork.

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:06.590
But there's this-- If you've
ever seen the Spiderman movie,

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:08.730
this is the line that you
keep repeating over and over

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:10.030
with it-- like with-- you know,

00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:11.540
with great power comes
great responsibility.

00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:14.220
And I feel like that,
that if I have a platform,

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:16.350
that I want to use it to try
and share with other people

00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:17.650
and help other people
tell their voices.

00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:20.480
And this brings me to my--
back to my mixed feelings,

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:25.100
which is that I fight really
hard against the idea that,

00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:27.970
you know, I am any kind of
chosen one or that I'm going

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:29.270
to be like the next Amy Tan,

00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:30.920
because I think that's a
really harmful way of thinking.

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:34.300
I mean, I think the truth is
that I'm not going to speak

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:35.600
for everybody just

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:37.450
as Amy doesn't speak
for-- nobody speaks for--

00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:38.750
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: There's
no monolithic experience

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:40.050
of anything.

00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:41.350
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: That's
exactly it.

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:42.650
And so I think-- And
Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,

00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:43.950
who's an amazing writer,

00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:45.430
the author of "We
Should All Be Feminists"

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:48.960
and "Americanah" among other
things has a great TED Talk

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:51.560
about this, which I encourage
all of you to go and watch

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:52.860
if you've never seen it.

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:56.580
Just Google, TED Talk, Danger of
a Single Story, where she talks

00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:59.850
about how this is a really
dangerous way of thinking.

00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:02.610
Because, first, that
one story is not going

00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:05.410
to represent everybody, so you
need more voices to be heard.

00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:07.080
And second, it puts a
huge amount of pressure

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:09.910
on those particular stories
to talk for everyone.

00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:11.210
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Yeah.

00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:12.510
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: I'm thinking--

00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:14.590
We were talking about this
being this sort of August

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:18.550
of Asian-Americans with "Crazy
Rich Asians" and all this.

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:22.140
And there have been bunch of
articles questioning whether,

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:24.970
you know, is "Crazy Rich
Asians" Asian enough,

00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:28.610
because it only shows this one
segment of Asian population?

00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:30.640
And my thought is, right,
it's the crazy rich--

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:31.940
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Right.

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:33.240
[Laughter]

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.540
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: -- section.

00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:35.840
Like Asia is really big.

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:38.050
It involves a lot of
different people who have a lot

00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:39.350
of different experiences.

00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:41.460
And even-- You can't even say
that, you know, like this is all

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:43.330
of Singapore, because
there's a lot

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:44.680
of different groups
in Singapore.

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:47.310
There's a lot of
different everything.

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:51.050
And to say, you know, that like
if you say there's only going

00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:53.770
to be this one movie and it's
got to represent everybody,

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:55.450
you're almost dooming
that from the beginning.

00:32:55.450 --> 00:32:56.750
And I think the only
way to solve

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:59.040
that is to have more voices.

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:01.890
We need more Asian women,
we need more Asian men.

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:04.260
We need more, you know,
black men and black women

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:06.260
and we need more gay stories
and we need more like--

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:08.910
we need more everything
basically.

00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:11.510
So that's sort of the
responsibility that I feel

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:14.520
in trying to sort of boost
other people's voices,

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:16.820
is just to make there be more.

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:18.120
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: That's
a great answer.

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:19.420
Does anybody have any questions?

00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:20.720
I can't believe--

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.020
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: I know
there's no questions.

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:23.320
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: -- there aren't
a million people lined up.

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:24.620
Like--

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:25.920
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: We
can keep talking.

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:27.220
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: We
can keep talking.

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:28.520
We have a lot of
fronts to cover--

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:29.820
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: I will
also take goofy questions.

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:31.120
If you want to know what
my favorite candy is,

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:32.420
I'm here to talk about candy.

00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:33.720
Yes?

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:37.020
&gt;&gt; Ohio in here, and I wanted to
know how you went about writing

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:38.720
about the place that
you grew up.

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.540
Did you just do it from memory?

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:42.700
Did you go back to Shaker
Heights and explore?

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:45.930
And then how much do you
feel like you have to stick

00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:48.930
to the facts and how much
can you make it also a place

00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:50.300
of imagination?

00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:53.100
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: Well, so, when
I wrote about Shaker Heights,

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:55.840
I was terrified basically.

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:57.700
Because when you're
writing about your hometown

00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:00.190
or you're writing about
any real place, there--

00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:03.940
I think you have an obligation
to try and portray that place

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:05.730
as accurately as you can,

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:09.300
and also because other
people might show up and say,

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:11.200
that's not where the school is.

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:14.250
That's not-- [Laughter] And if
any of you know Shaker Heights

00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:16.030
and I know there are some of you
out there because you've come

00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:18.190
up to tell me that you're
from Shaker Heights,

00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:21.310
I have definitely gotten
emails about various things

00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:24.090
that I got wrong about
Shaker Heights, because--

00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:27.960
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Don't
do-- Don't email that.

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:29.970
Going forward, just
don't email that, yeah.

00:34:29.970 --> 00:34:31.270
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: To be
fair, one was my mom

00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:32.570
where the first thing
she said after she--

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:36.750
[laughter] after she read the
first, I think, page-and-a-half,

00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:39.800
she said, isn't it
South Woodland like Road

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:41.150
and not South Woodland
Boulevard?

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:43.250
And I said, mom, that's the
first thing you noticed?

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:45.180
So actually, it's your question.

00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:47.300
I tried to be as
accurate as I could.

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:48.690
I had a map of Shaker Heights.

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:51.150
I did go back to Shaker.

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:54.530
I pulled out my yearbooks which
was an interesting experience

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:57.500
to revisit my high school life.

00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:00.920
The Shaker Heights Public
Library was an amazing resource

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:03.520
and I feel like this is where
I should give a shout-out

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:04.820
to libraries and librarians.

00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:09.100
They have actually a
room of local history.

00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:11.720
And so when I went in and I
told the wonderful local history

00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:14.880
librarian, Meghan Hayes, what
I was looking for, I said,

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.240
I'm interested in this period,

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:20.250
she pulled out school
newspapers from that era.

00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:22.070
You know, I found an
editorial that I had written

00:35:22.070 --> 00:35:25.790
in junior year of high school
for the guest editorial.

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:27.630
But I could find
out so many things

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:30.150
about like what restaurants were
we going to, how much did a cup

00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:31.880
of coffee cost, because
they were telling you

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:33.180
where you'd get the best value

00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:34.780
for your coffee,
all these things.

00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:38.040
So, I tried to make the
facts of Shaker Heights

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.430
as accurate as possible.

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:41.610
And then where I tried to
allow myself sort of that space

00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:45.810
of imagination that you talk
about was with the characters,

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:48.910
to think about what
sort of characters

00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:52.190
who don't exist might
do in this real place.

00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:53.490
Thank you.

00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:54.970
I guess you should go up here.

00:35:54.970 --> 00:35:57.460
&gt;&gt; Hi. So, I identify
as mixed Asian-American

00:35:57.460 --> 00:36:00.090
and I've been having a lot of
conversations recently with my,

00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:03.750
I guess, full-race
Asian-American friends and a lot

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:05.400
of them have never really
thought about what it's

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.730
like to be mixed and to be half.

00:36:06.730 --> 00:36:08.970
And I'm really curious
about how you decided

00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:11.710
to make the characters in
your first book biracial

00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:13.010
because it's not
something we see a lot,

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:15.550
so I'm really interested to
see what you're inspired by.

00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:16.850
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: Great.

00:36:16.850 --> 00:36:19.280
Yeah, I think this is a
conversation that's happening

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:20.580
more and more for
really good reasons

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:24.470
because there are more
multiracial kids out there.

00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:28.110
It's something that I
thought about a lot because--

00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:31.020
first, because I'm the mom
of a biracial kid, I have a--

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:33.290
my husband is white so
we have a mixed kid.

00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:35.590
And I think of a lot about of
what his experience is going

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:36.890
to be like.

00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:38.360
We happened to live on a
street where four houses

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:40.660
in a row have mixed-race
families.

00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:43.920
So, my son thinks that this is
totally normal and all the kids

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:46.500
on the street kind
of look like him.

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:50.290
And I love that he's able
to have that experience.

00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:53.810
For me, it was also a way
for me to try and write

00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:59.570
about Chinese-American identity
in a way that felt right to me,

00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:02.910
because I've always felt sort
of like a fake Asian in a way.

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:05.790
Both of my parents
came from Hong Kong

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:08.300
but I was born here
in the States.

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:10.020
I've lived my whole life here.

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:12.210
I don't speak Cantonese.

00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:16.240
I feel in a lot of ways like I
don't know all the Asian things,

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:18.080
the Chinese things that
I'm supposed to know.

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:19.790
And so this was a way
for me to sort of write

00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:22.780
about the difficulties of
feeling like you have parts

00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:24.260
of your identity in
two different places.

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:28.420
And it may be that I didn't
get it right, but I'm hoping

00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:30.550
that there will be
more stories out there

00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:32.920
so that other people
can tell those stories.

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:34.220
Thank you.

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:37.270
We'll go here and I'll try and
be faster so I can get finished.

00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:38.570
Yes?

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:39.870
&gt;&gt; So thank you.

00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:42.290
So I've read both authors'
books and I can't help but note

00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:44.510
that there are real
similarities, both of them talk

00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:47.320
about white privilege with
very privileged white suburban

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:51.650
families, transracial adoption
is a theme in both books.

00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:54.390
So I'm wondering, for
both of you, what you see

00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:56.170
as similarities and differences

00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:57.700
in the way you approached
your stories

00:37:57.700 --> 00:38:02.080
and also why now do you
think that, you know,

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:03.530
both your stories are emerging

00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:05.920
and that there is an audience
who's very interested,

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:11.420
at least I am, in reading
these stories and feeling

00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:14.620
like they have a
lot to offer us?

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:17.300
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: I was
shocked when I got your book.

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:20.900
I-- I'm trying to remember
when I would have got--

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:22.200
I think I must have been--

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.510
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: If you
were finishing the draft

00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:25.010
of "That Kind of
Mother"-- So Rumaan's book,

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:26.310
"That Kind of Mother",

00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:28.110
also deals with a
transracial adoption.

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:29.440
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: And
so I got your book

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:31.670
and I didn't know anything
about it, and I read it

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:35.350
and I was like, wow,
this is terrible.

00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:37.260
A much more successful
novelist has written

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:39.300
on exactly the same subject.

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:41.880
[Laughter] But actually,
I think--

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:44.610
I actually found it like so
enticing and like fascinating

00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:48.260
that we had both
ended up on, you know,

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:51.060
the tension between being
an artist and being a mother

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:52.440
on the question of adoption.

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:54.280
Like it's just-- It was
like a funny coincidence.

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:55.580
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: And I then came

00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:58.030
up with two very
different books, right?

00:38:58.030 --> 00:39:00.480
So you should also
read my last book.

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:01.780
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Two
very different books,

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:04.030
a successful one and
a less successful one.

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:06.900
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: But to more
seriously answer your question

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:10.780
though, I think that I
don't know why this is sort

00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:12.980
of a topic that's coming
up but I'm glad that it is.

00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:17.080
And one of the reasons might
be that I think that especially

00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:19.260
over the past, let's
say, two years,

00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:22.160
we're talking a lot more
openly about issues of race,

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:23.460
which I think is difficult

00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:25.220
but I think is also a
really important thing,

00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:30.660
because we have race problems
in America and it's complicated.

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:34.440
And it comes-- you know,
it manifests itself

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:35.740
in a lot of different ways.

00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:38.570
And I think it's just becoming
part of the conversation.

00:39:38.570 --> 00:39:42.090
I mean, I started writing this
book many years before the 2016

00:39:42.090 --> 00:39:45.240
election, race issues didn't--

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:46.620
were not invented
by that election.

00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:47.920
They'd been there all the time.

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.220
I think it's just
now, they're sort

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.520
of floating up to the surface.

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:51.820
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: And then
as the previous woman

00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:54.240
who asked the question
before, the population

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:58.180
in this country is changing

00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:02.310
and so the question only becomes
more salient as time passes.

00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:04.800
And as-- You know, in
Celeste's first book,

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:08.830
the couple at the heart of the
book, this interracial couple,

00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:10.130
when they are married,

00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:14.410
their marriage is not even legal
throughout the United States

00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:16.250
because it predates
Loving versus Virginia.

00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:20.200
So, we have come a
long way as a society

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:23.030
and we are going
still further I think.

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:24.330
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: Yeah.

00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:25.630
I think we're continuing
in that direction,

00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:28.980
and so that's the
population that we are.

00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:30.900
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:33.860
&gt;&gt; So I actually-- I went to
college outside of Cleveland

00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:35.620
so I'm familiar with
Shaker Heights.

00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:36.920
So it was--

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:38.220
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: Did
you go to Oberlin?

00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:39.520
&gt;&gt; No, I didn't.

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:40.820
I went to Kent State, but
I have friends at JCU--

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:42.120
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: This is like
the code people use sometimes.

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:44.590
&gt;&gt; So it was really cool to read
your book and kind of, you know,

00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:46.940
it's always neat to
have that experience

00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:49.790
of reading someone's version
of a place that you've been

00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:52.040
and experienced somewhat
intimately.

00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:55.020
But I think that,
you know, your--

00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:57.760
the way that you described
Shaker is, you know,

00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:00.040
with all the detail that you
used and everything else,

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:04.210
it's more than a plot or
rather more than a setting.

00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:07.110
It almost feels like another
character in the book and--

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:10.380
but at the same time,
your plot is so finely

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:13.820
and intricately woven together
that you have all of these,

00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:15.180
you know, kind of breadcrumbs

00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:17.970
that you would leave throughout
the novel and then they sort

00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:19.270
of culminate together.

00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:21.820
And so I was just
interested to find

00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:24.380
out like what's your process
like when you're writing a book

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:28.360
that you have so many, you know,
really salient kind of parts?

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:29.730
Like where do you begin?

00:41:29.730 --> 00:41:31.960
Do you begin with your place

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:33.670
or what you want your
characters to be like?

00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:37.400
Or, you know, how do you
build that culminating moment?

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.960
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: This is a big
question for writers, right,

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:40.480
which is sort of like,
how did you do that?

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:44.820
My-- And I wish I knew
because I am know trying

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:47.420
to write a third book and
I am trying desperately

00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:50.480
to remember how I did
it the first two times.

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:55.860
For "Little Fires Everywhere",
it's-- it makes sense that you,

00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:57.360
you know, start it off
thinking about Shaker Heights

00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:59.970
because that was sort of where
the story started for me also.

00:41:59.970 --> 00:42:02.100
For me, it was sort of like
a character and I wanted--

00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:03.790
I knew I wanted to
write about this place.

00:42:03.790 --> 00:42:07.210
And so for me, it really
started with that place

00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:09.660
and I imagined sort of
what a prototypical family

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:11.400
in that place might look like.

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:13.040
And that's sort of how I
came up with the Richardsons,

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:16.060
if you imagine the most
quintessential Shaker family--

00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:17.590
Shaker Heights family,
I should say,

00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:19.970
that they had-- that
might be them.

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:22.350
And I sort of tried to
imagine sort of what kind

00:42:22.350 --> 00:42:24.660
of trouble I could
stir up for them,

00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:26.260
because that's what writers do.

00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:28.520
So we're mean to our
characters, we make trouble.

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:31.310
And this other family from out
of town came in, who were going

00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:33.960
to be really, you know,
at odds with them.

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:35.430
And so, for me, that's sort of--

00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:37.870
once I have those
characters together,

00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:41.100
it's almost like you put them--
you've got your little figurines

00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:44.220
in and you just let them
fight it out with each other.

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:48.170
So for me, a lot of the process
is just sort of imagining what--

00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:51.450
you know, how they would poke
at each other, how they would,

00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:52.750
you know, irritate each other,

00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:55.160
how they would find
connections for each other.

00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:57.080
For me, there's a lot of
going down blind alleys

00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:58.920
in trying to figure out--

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:00.500
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: I was going to
ask you, do you know in advance

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:02.920
or are you surprised by
where the narrative moves?

00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:04.940
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: I know the
general arc of it usually.

00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:07.090
I usually can't get
going until I have sort

00:43:07.090 --> 00:43:08.390
of a destination in mind.

00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:09.690
It's like planning a road trip.

00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:11.350
I know where I'm going and
I have an idea I'm going

00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:12.650
to stop here and here.

00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:15.900
But I don't always take
the route that I expect,

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:18.700
so there's space for questions
but I knew for example

00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:20.000
from the beginning
that it was going

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.300
to end with this house fire.

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:23.380
This doesn't give anything away,
it happens on the first page.

00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:24.680
[Laughter] But similarly--

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:25.980
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: It
happens in the title--

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:27.280
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: It
happens in the title.

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:28.580
So I knew that.

00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:32.530
How exactly it was gong
to shake out was sort

00:43:32.530 --> 00:43:34.480
of the discovery process for me.

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:35.780
I'm seeing this--

00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:37.080
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: We're supposed
to wrap it up but I feel

00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:39.230
like we're the last
event in the room,

00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:41.510
so I feel like you could answer
one more question, right?

00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:43.160
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: OK, I think I
can answer one more question.

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:44.460
So--

00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:45.760
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:47.060
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: Hi.

00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:49.450
&gt;&gt; So, when I was younger,
I read that Kurt Vonnegut.

00:43:49.450 --> 00:43:53.930
The reason I thought I liked
him was because he was able

00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:57.390
to marry humor to the
very serious, the dark.

00:43:57.390 --> 00:44:03.120
As I got older, I understood
it was his lack of judgment

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:05.690
on the characters that he wrote.

00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:09.790
He as a person could judge
as we see in his nonfiction,

00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:16.790
he felt a little freer in
nonfiction to be judgmental.

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:19.650
What is the author's
responsibility

00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:23.410
to their characters as far
as judgment is concerned?

00:44:23.410 --> 00:44:25.080
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: Oh, that is a
really interesting question.

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:26.380
Why--

00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:27.930
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: You caused them
trouble, you just said you liked

00:44:27.930 --> 00:44:29.530
to cause-- you cause
them trouble but--

00:44:29.530 --> 00:44:30.830
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: You do.

00:44:30.830 --> 00:44:32.130
Well, trouble is what makes
stories interesting, right?

00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:34.850
If you-- You know, if someone
says, how was your day,

00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:37.590
and you were like, my day was
great, that's kind of the end.

00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:38.900
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: It's
a short story, yeah.

00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:40.200
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: It's
a very short story.

00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:42.360
But the question of sort of what
about judging your characters,

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:46.510
I think, is really great
one, because I actually feel

00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:52.300
that if the author comes to
their characters with contempt,

00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:53.860
it shows in the story.

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:56.260
And I think you have
to, as an author,

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:58.540
love your characters
even if you don't agree

00:44:58.540 --> 00:44:59.840
with what they're doing.

00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:03.210
So, in both of my novels, I've
got characters who, I think,

00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:05.330
make some pretty bad choices,

00:45:05.330 --> 00:45:07.090
or choices that I would
not make, let's say.

00:45:07.090 --> 00:45:08.970
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Sort
of an understatement.

00:45:08.970 --> 00:45:11.340
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: And I actually
think every single character

00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:15.750
makes some choices
that are maybe poorly--

00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:17.050
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Questionable.

00:45:17.050 --> 00:45:18.350
&gt;&gt; -- judged.

00:45:18.350 --> 00:45:19.650
Questionable is a
nice way to put it.

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:21.620
And so, I feel like, you
know, I've got my own opinions

00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:24.570
but my job as the
author is not--

00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:27.030
is to not make heroes
and villains.

00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:29.210
My son is seven and he's at
this age where they're really

00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:32.020
into who the good guys
and the bad guys are.

00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:36.490
And what I try to get through to
him is that bad guys don't think

00:45:36.490 --> 00:45:37.790
that they're bad guys.

00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:42.050
The bad guys usually think
that they are the good guys.

00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:45.490
And so, my job, I think, is
rather than to get the reader

00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:49.090
to condemn all the people that I
hate and to love all the people

00:45:49.090 --> 00:45:51.850
that I love, rather to present
them with these characters

00:45:51.850 --> 00:45:55.610
so that at the end,
hopefully they say, well,

00:45:55.610 --> 00:45:58.150
I really didn't like
that person.

00:45:58.150 --> 00:46:01.280
But I kind of understand
why she did what she did.

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:04.520
That's sort of usually
my goal as a writer,

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:07.630
is to make you see the
complexity of what a person is,

00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:10.430
even if you still think
that you would never want

00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:12.580
to have a beer with
Mrs. Richardson.

00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:14.320
I don't think she's
not really a beer--

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:15.620
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: She's
not a beer-drinker,

00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:17.200
she's like a chardonnay-drinker
but--

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:18.990
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: So you never
have a chardonnay with her.

00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:21.830
But I think that's sort
of the best answer I have

00:46:21.830 --> 00:46:23.640
for the question, is
that, you know, you're--

00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:25.370
if you've condemned
your characters

00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:27.780
or if you are wholeheartedly
sort of waving the flag for one

00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:29.770
of your characters, then I think
actually you haven't looked

00:46:29.770 --> 00:46:32.580
at the characters close enough.

00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:34.790
I think that your job
as the writer is really

00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:38.390
to show your characters
as humans,

00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:40.840
which means that they're
going to be flawed.

00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:43.470
And I think that that
often is sort of,

00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:46.630
for novels that don't work
for me, that's often the case

00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:48.680
where the author hasn't
looked closely enough.

00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:49.980
&gt;&gt; Rumaan Alam: Well,
I think that everyone

00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:51.280
in the room will
agree that you--

00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:53.270
that mission accomplished
on that.

00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:56.000
So, it was such a
pleasure to hear from you

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.310
about your two wonderful books.

00:46:57.310 --> 00:46:58.610
And thank you so much.

00:46:58.610 --> 00:46:59.910
This was great.

00:46:59.910 --> 00:47:01.210
&gt;&gt; Celeste Ng: Thank you.

00:47:01.210 --> 00:47:01.440
[Applause]
