00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.840
- [Narrator] We're told that Epic Eats

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.600
is a perfectly competitive,
profit-maximizing producer

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.820
of stuffed sandwiches, and hires workers

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.408
in a perfectly competitive labor market.

00:00:11.408 --> 00:00:15.890
Part A says, draw side-by-side
graphs for the labor market

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.181
and for Epic Eats and show
each of the following.

00:00:19.181 --> 00:00:21.610
So pause this video and see
if you could have a go at it

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.944
before we do it together.

00:00:23.944 --> 00:00:25.830
All right, now let's do it together.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.400
So we're gonna do side-by-side graphs,

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.371
one for the market, and
one for the firm Epic Eats.

00:00:30.371 --> 00:00:32.290
So let me do that.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.633
So, this will be my market.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.700
This is my market graph.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.980
And so this is going to
be quantity of labor.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.810
Quantity of labor.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.010
And then on the vertical
axis, I have my wages,

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.130
which you could view as the
price of labor, the wage rate.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.103
And so this is the market.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.950
And then over here, I
wanted it side-by-side.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.030
This is going to be the firm.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.853
This is going to be Epic Eats.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.950
Once again, I have
quantity, quantity of labor.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.580
And I'm going to have the wage rate.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.713
And this is Epic Eats.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.723
That's the firm level.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.968
Now, they want us to show the market wage

00:01:24.968 --> 00:01:29.090
and the quantity of workers
hired in the market.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.847
Well, to do that, we're
going to have to think about

00:01:31.847 --> 00:01:35.860
the demand for workers in the market.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.140
Well, at a high wage
rate, there's not gonna be

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.770
a lot of labor demanded.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.410
And then as the wage goes
down, more, more people

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.020
are going to wanna hire people.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.262
This is the market labor demand curve.

00:01:49.262 --> 00:01:52.290
Demand curve.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.135
And then then supply curve
is gonna be upward sloping.

00:01:55.135 --> 00:01:58.390
At a low wage rate, not a lot
of people are going to wanna

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.170
give their labor.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.440
But then as wages go up, people will,

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.670
more and more people are likely do enter,

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.656
want to be part of the labor force.

00:02:06.656 --> 00:02:11.656
So this is going to be the
market labor supply curve.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.500
And then we have our equilibrium wage,

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.180
which they want us to label W sub M.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.820
So that is going to be right over here.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.047
W, sub lowercase M.

00:02:26.047 --> 00:02:28.613
And then the quantity of
workers hired in the market

00:02:28.613 --> 00:02:32.113
is going to be capital L, sub lowercase M.

00:02:33.025 --> 00:02:35.800
Capital L, sub lowercase M.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.190
So we did this first part, the fact part

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.240
that focuses on the market.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.560
Then they want us to focus on
the marginal factor cost curve

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.670
labeled MFC.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.630
Well that's what it's
going to cost Epic Eats

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.040
to hire folks.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.840
And we're dealing with a,

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.520
it hires in a perfectly
competitive labor market.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.390
So which is gonna pay the market wages.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.126
So let me do that.

00:03:00.126 --> 00:03:04.584
So this is going to be the
price it pays for labor

00:03:04.584 --> 00:03:09.584
which is its marginal factor cost curve,

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.310
MFC, just like that.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.900
So I did the second part.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.260
The marginal revenue product, labeled MRP.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.700
Well the way you typically look at it,

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.789
it is for Epic Eats that it has some

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:25.550
marginal revenue product
at a certain quantity.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.908
And then as it hires more and more people,

00:03:27.908 --> 00:03:30.220
intends to have diminishing returns.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.217
So typical marginal revenue product curve

00:03:32.217 --> 00:03:34.400
looks something like this.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.050
So it's MRP, did that part.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.070
The wage paid by the
firm, labeled W sub F,

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.230
and the quantity of
workers hired by the firm,

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.360
labeled L sub F.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.088
Well the wage paid by the firm,

00:03:46.088 --> 00:03:48.690
that's dictated by the market wage.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.690
So we can say that this is
equal to the market wage,

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.730
which is equal to the
wage paid by the firm.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:58.820
And you could put this over here.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.580
The wage paid by the
firm is right over there.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:02.610
So I did this first part,

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.354
and the quantity of
workers hired by the firm.

00:04:04.354 --> 00:04:06.250
Well what would be rational is,

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.342
is that they would keep hiring people

00:04:08.342 --> 00:04:11.912
until the marginal revenue
product is no longer higher

00:04:11.912 --> 00:04:16.020
than that marginal cost of
hiring that extra unit of labor.

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.000
So it's right at that
point of intersection.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.140
And so that is the quantity
of workers hired by the firm,

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.440
so L.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.881
Now let's do the next part.

00:04:23.881 --> 00:04:28.240
It says, assume that there is an increase

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.582
in the price of Epic
Eats' stuffed sandwiches.

00:04:30.582 --> 00:04:34.840
In the short run, will
the wage paid by Epic Eats

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.800
be higher than, lower
than, or equal to W, sub F?

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.660
Explain.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.251
So pause this video and
see if you can answer that.

00:04:43.251 --> 00:04:46.370
Well in the short run, Epic Eats,

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.990
no matter how much it
hires or doesn't hire,

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.210
it's just going to pay the same wage.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.940
So we could say, it is
going to be equal to.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.520
Equal, equal.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.740
So pay equal to WF

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.040
because operating

00:05:09.687 --> 00:05:13.650
in perfectly competitive

00:05:17.788 --> 00:05:18.871
labor market.

00:05:20.183 --> 00:05:21.266
Labor market.

00:05:24.284 --> 00:05:27.610
In the short run, what will
happen to the number of workers

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.060
hired by Epic Eats?

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.580
Explain.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.898
So in the short run, if
the wage is being the same,

00:05:34.898 --> 00:05:37.574
but hey had a price increase.

00:05:37.574 --> 00:05:41.470
So that means that the MRP is
going to shift to the right

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.260
because per unit, they're
going to be able to sell it

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.120
for more, you're gonna a have a situation

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.900
where the MRP switches
shifts to the right,

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.300
or right and up.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.570
And so you're gonna have MRP to,

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.400
this is after the price increase.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.400
And notice, now we intersect
the MFC line at a higher point.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.433
And so what will happen to
the number of workers hired?

00:06:02.433 --> 00:06:07.433
So number of workers goes up

00:06:09.941 --> 00:06:11.630
because

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.470
MRP shifts up

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.000
due to price increase

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.370
which causes it

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.240
to intersect

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:40.580
your marginal factor
cost curve, MFC at higher

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:49.069
quantity of labor hired.

00:06:50.256 --> 00:06:53.053
All right, now let's do part C.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.680
Epic Eats uses capital and labor

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.750
in the production of sandwiches.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.680
The marginal product of the
last unit of capital used

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.280
is 4,000 units and the marginal
product of the last unit

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.905
of labor used is 3,000.

00:07:10.905 --> 00:07:14.920
If Epic Eats minimizes costs
and the rental rate of capital

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.970
is $400, what is the wage rate?

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:20.123
So pause this video and see
if you could answer that.

00:07:20.123 --> 00:07:22.840
All right, so they give us a few things.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.157
So the marginal product of
the last unit of capital.

00:07:25.157 --> 00:07:28.070
So you say, marginal product
of the last unit of capital.

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.410
I used K for capital even
though I know it's...

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:32.500
Not to confuse ourselves
with something else.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.920
Although, you could argue
to use C, but we'll use K

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.130
to ease confusion.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:38.870
So the marginal product
of the unit of capital

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:41.617
is equal to 4,000 units.

00:07:41.617 --> 00:07:46.330
We know that the marginal
product of the last unit of labor

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:50.390
is equal to 3,000 units.

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:52.330
And we could view this right of here.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.110
The rental rate of
capital, you can view this

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:55.620
as the price of capital.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.500
You could also view this
as the marginal factor

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.520
cost of capital, but I'll just call this

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.600
the price of capital is equal to $400.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.420
And they want us to get the wage rate..

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:10.098
So you could view this
as the price of labor

00:08:10.098 --> 00:08:11.872
is equal to what?

00:08:11.872 --> 00:08:14.610
And they tell us that
it's minimizing cost.

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:17.790
And what we can think about
it is, the number of units

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:20.634
per dollar that the firm
gets it on the margin,

00:08:20.634 --> 00:08:23.740
if they're able to get
more units per dollar

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:28.420
by switching, by putting
that extra dollar into labor

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.330
versus capital, or capital versus labor,

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:31.730
they're going to do it.

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:34.620
So what we would assume is,
is that the number of units

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.870
per dollar that they're
getting at this point

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:38.890
are going to be the
same whether they invest

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:40.530
in labor or capital.

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:43.330
And so the number of units per
dollar that they're getting

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:47.683
from the capital is the
marginal product of the capital

00:08:47.683 --> 00:08:50.550
divided by the price of the capital

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:52.430
this is the number of units per dollar.

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:56.040
And this needs to be equal to
the number of units per dollar

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.150
that they're getting from
that last unit of labor.

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:00.560
So that's the marginal product of labor.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.670
So the units they're getting
from labor on the margin

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:06.360
divided by the price
of labor on the margin,

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.080
and then we just solve for this.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.880
So this will get us to,
we're gonna have 4,000,

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:16.880
this is 4,000 units divided by $400.

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:24.870
It's going to be equal
to 3,000 units divided by

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.670
the price of labor.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:28.610
So you can manipulate this a little bit,

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:31.050
you could divide both sides by 400.

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:36.050
So this is going to be
10 units per dollar.

00:09:36.551 --> 00:09:39.185
So let me scroll down a
little bit right over here.

00:09:39.185 --> 00:09:41.820
So we could, this is, let's see...

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.427
Yup, this is going to
be 10 units per dollar

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:54.887
is going to be equal to
3,000 units divided by

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:57.860
the price of labor.

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.010
And so, you just do a
little bit of manipulation,

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:01.850
multiply both sides by the price of labor,

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:03.370
divide both sides by 10.

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:05.080
You do a little bit of Algebra.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:09.493
This gets you to $300 per,

00:10:09.493 --> 00:10:11.896
for the incremental cost of labor.

00:10:11.896 --> 00:10:15.370
So this is going to get
us to the price of labor

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:16.983
is equal to $300.

00:10:18.141 --> 00:10:21.550
And you can verify that,
you could plug it back in

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:22.540
if you like.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:23.373
And we're done!
