00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.550
When you think of Easter eggs in popular culture,
you tend to think of them being included in

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.619
movies - and rightfully so, as movies are
full of fun references and nods these days

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:15.469
- but television shows are also starting to
get in on the act.

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.680
You can often find sneaky inclusions - or
even explicit mentions - of other franchises

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.910
in television series.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.000
As one of the most popular movie franchises
of all time - and an important part of pop

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.430
culture history - Star Wars is one of the
most often referenced franchises in fiction.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.219
Here, we'll list ten examples in which that's
been the case on the small screen.

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:37.690
So please, watch our video, subscribe to our
channel, and keep checking ScreenRant for

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.190
more great videos in the same mould as this
one.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.109
Here are ten popular TV shows that referenced
Star Wars.

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:47.530
Family Guy
How could we make a video about TV shows that

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:54.750
referenced Star Wars without mentioning Seth
MacFarlane's brilliant Family Guy?

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.239
As well as multiple references in the regular
shows, it also goes without saying that the

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.089
animated series about the Griffin family and
their friends and associates has full-on parodied

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:06.881
Star Wars on more than one occasion in the
form of Laugh It Up, Fuzzball: The Family

00:01:06.881 --> 00:01:07.881
Guy Trilogy.

00:01:07.881 --> 00:01:12.580
The first of the trilogy was 2007's Blue Harvest,
which was followed by 2009's Something, Something,

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.550
Something, Dark Side and 2010's It's a Trap!

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.350
It's a retelling of the original Star Wars
trilogy with Family Guy characters as Star

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.659
Wars characters, such as Peter Griffin as
Han Solo, Stewie Griffin as Darth Vader, Brian

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.880
Griffin as Chewbacca and Chris Griffin as
Luke Skywalker.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.290
If you haven't seen the trilogy already, watch
it!

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.350
It's superb.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.920
American Dad
Predictably, given that it's also a Seth MacFarlane

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.579
show and he's clearly a fan of the franchise,
American Dad has also made a number of references

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:43.680
to Star Wars over the years.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.200
While it hasn't explicitly parodied the franchise
like Family Guy has, it's certainly been mentioned

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.630
in the show a lot.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.740
Examples include Steve Smith's ongoing interest
in the franchise, Stan Smith confusing Star

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.090
Wars with Star Trek, Stan meeting the internet
phenomenon known as Star Wars kid at a convention

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.039
that also included characters dressed as Stormtroopers
and Ewoks, and Steve having two assistants

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.790
dressed like Princess Leia in her slave girl
outfit.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.100
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.159
The Phase 2 movies of the Marvel Cinematic
Universe all had a recurring Easter egg that

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:17.900
was a nod to the Star Wars franchise - characters
would lose a hand or arm, just like Luke Skywalker

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.220
did in 1980's The Empire Strikes Back.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.209
The likes of Aldrich Killian in Iron Man 3
and Ulysses Klaue in Avengers: Age of Ultron

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.430
are examples of that.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.260
But it also extended to the MCU's television
spin-off, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.930
Agent Phil Coulson asked Mack to amputate
his lower arm to prevent further petrification

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.500
caused by a Terrigen Crystal in the season
two finale S.O.S. and he now has a prosthetic

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.659
hand - which is also like Luke Skywalker.

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:48.840
Doctor Who
Doctor Who is among the most likely television

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.330
shows to reference Star Wars, given the space-settings
in each franchise, so it's no surprise that

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.730
there was a cool reference in one episode
of the show.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.730
It came in Face the Raven - the tenth episode
of the ninth series of the show's modern run

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.370
- and it came in the form an odd looking box
in the background.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.680
There was a bizarre language written on the
box, which actually turned out to be Aurebesh,

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.849
the standard language in the Star Wars universe.

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.750
Even more interestingly, fans of Star Wars
have deciphered it - and it actually says

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.020
"DeLorean", which means it doubles-up as a
Back to the Future Easter egg too!

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.799
The Simpsons
We now come to another classic animated series

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:23.980
in the form of The Simpsons.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.099
Matt Groening must also be a big fan of the
Star Wars franchise, as The Simpsons is absolutely

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.799
teaming with references to it - so let's get
to a few of them without further ado.

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.030
The first ever Treehouse of Horror episode
saw Lisa snooping around Kang and Kodos' ship.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.230
The ship itself and the and music playing
at the time were very reminiscent of the halls

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.769
of the Death Star and Luke Skywalker's theme
from the first Star Wars movie.

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.110
In the episode Lisa the Beauty Queen, Lisa
tried a few different hairstyles - one of

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.540
which was Princess Leia's.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.450
In the episode Burns, Baby Burns, Darth Vader's
mask could be seen in Springfield's costume

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.450
shop.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.760
And in The Last Temptation of Krust, the "Java
the Hut" coffeehouse was an obvious reference

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.420
to Jabba the Hutt.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.000
Buffy the Vampire Slayer
Joss Whedon's classic television show Buffy

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.300
the Vampire Slayer had a lot of references
to Star Wars - with Nicholas Brendon's Xander

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.140
Harris and the evil Trio in particular being
huge fans of the franchise, as they quoted

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.010
and referred to it on many occasions - but
they weren't the only characters to do so.

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.049
Faith, Ben and a number of other characters
made references to the franchise, while Spike

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.770
even referred to Angel as "his Yoda" in the
episode School Hard.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.740
It should also be noted that the spin-off
show, Angel, had a number of Star Wars references,

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.740
such as Charles Gunn referring to Angelus
as "Darth Vampire" in the episode Calvary.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.070
The Buffy the Vampire Slayer theme tune was
also notably performed by the band "Nerf Herder",

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:49.960
who were named after Princess Leia's comment
to Han Solo in The Empire Strikes Back.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.419
Firefly
Joss Whedon must have a thing for Star Wars,

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:57.169
because Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel
weren't the only shows of his to reference

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:00.740
the epic sci-fi franchise - the short-lived
Firefly series did too.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.819
In the pilot episode, when Inara is docking
the shuttle, an Imperial shuttle from Star

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:06.240
Wars flies over head.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.060
Also, in the episode Shindig, just as the
camera pans down to the crew in the streets,

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.850
you can see the Star Wars ship known as the
Starlight Intruder.

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.259
This ship isn't from the Star Wars movies,
but it is from the Dark Horse Comics Star

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:19.110
Wars metaseries from the 1990s entitled Dark
Empire.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.110
The Big Bang Theory
The Big Bang Theory's four main characters

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.110
- Leonard Hofstadter, Sheldon Cooper, Howard
Wolowitz and Rajesh Koothrappali - are all

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.110
huge fans of all things sci-fi, and that undoubtedly
includes Star Wars, so we could be on all

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.110
day with the number of Star Wars references
in the show.

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.110
With that in mind, we're only going to mention
the best one.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.110
It happened after Sheldon's childhood hero,
Bob Newhart's Arthur Jeffries who played kids'

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.110
TV character Professor Proton, had sadly passed
away.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.110
Professor Proton's ghost returns as a Jedi,
dressed in full Jedi garb, to give Sheldon

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.110
some advice in The Opening Night Excitation
episode (the one in which Sheldon wants to

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.110
watch The Force Awakens, incidentally).

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.110
South Park
Trey Parker and Matt Stone, like previous

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.110
show creators in this video, are quite obviously
huge Star Wars fans, because their brilliant

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.110
animated series South Park contains countless
references to the franchise.

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:33.110
Here are just a few examples...

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.240
The character of George Lucas appears on more
than one occasion in the show - in the episodes

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.000
Free Hat and The China Probrem, for example.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.710
Chef is turned into a cyborg called Darth
Chef in The Return of Chef.

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.581
Luke Skywalker, is seen as a member of the
Council of Nine in Imaginationland, Episode

00:05:46.581 --> 00:05:47.581
II.

00:05:47.581 --> 00:05:54.069
And Stormtroopers are seen murdering The Lollipop
King in Imaginationland, Episode III.

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:59.180
The Walking Dead
The Walking Dead is, arguably, the most popular

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.479
television show on the small screen right
now, so it's only fitting that it should reference

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:06.760
one of the most most popular movie franchises
of all time in Star Wars - and it has.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.340
That being said, The Walking Dead is unique
on this list, in the sense that the references

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.340
don't come from in the show itself.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.000
One of them was on Twitter, when the show's
official account tweeted a mashup poster of

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.620
the two franchises and prompted fans to reply
with similar crossovers.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:24.870
Additionally, on Red Nose Day in 2016, NBC
aired a sketch that saw The Walking Dead cast

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:29.319
spoofing the classic Star Wars Christmas special
- a sketch that even featured two actors playing

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:50.259
Han Solo!

00:06:50.259 --> 00:07:15.370
Thanks for watching our video about ten popular
TV shows that referenced Star Wars.

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:19.690

Wars references in them?
