00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.280
9th grade is always awkward.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.259
Pimples, braces, and “the talk”.

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.440
Hey everyone, Julia here for DNews

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.850
Health class get super awkward in high school.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.910
Where they talk about sex.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.210
But A 2011 Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) survey indicates that more

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.669
than 47 percent of all high school students
say they’ve had sex.

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:25.840
So sex ed isn’t going away anytime soon.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.810
In fact, it’s actually a good thing.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.410
One study published in the Journal of Adolescent
Health found that students who have any kind

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.579
of sex ed wait longer to have sex, and when
they do, they are more likely to use contraception.

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:38.050
So people want it.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.230
One poll by NPR, the Kaiser Family Foundation,
and Harvard's Kennedy School of Government

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.170
found that 93 percent of Americans agree that
sex education should be taught in schools.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.949
But there’s a debate on what kind of sex
ed is best.

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.379
Currently federal funding goes towards two
main types of programs.

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.589
The vast majority of federal funding for sex
ed programs, go towards what is called abstinence

00:00:57.589 --> 00:00:58.589
only programs.

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.820
These programs teach that the only safe sex
is not having it and emphasize that waiting

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.559
till marriage is the best.

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.310
When they do mention contraception, it’s
typically to show how often it fails.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.799
This type grew in popularity throughout the
early 2000s.

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:17.320
Funding for abstinence-only programs increased
from $9 million in 1997 to $176 million in

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.320
2007.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.450
But more recently, in 2010, funding was also
put towards what’s called “comprehensive”

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:23.450
sex ed.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.520
This can also emphasize waiting to have sex,
but it also talks about how to keep yourself

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.520
safe.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.670
LIke how to use a condom, what birth control
options are out there.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:31.670
That kind of thing.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.170
Who gets what, is really left up to the states.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.060
And there it get super confusing.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.430
Only 22 mandate any kind of sex education,
18 states and the District of Columbia require

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.010
that information on contraception be provided.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.480
37 states require that information on abstinence
be provided.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.920
And even fewer—13—require that instruction
be medically accurate.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.200
So which works better?

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.200
How do we define better?

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.899
A successful sex ed program might be defined
as one that lowers pregnancy and STI rates.

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.310
So a look at the literature on abstinence
only programs finds some misunderstandings.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.870
One study from researchers at the University
of Washington found that “abstinence”

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.410
meant different things to adults than it meant
to the students.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.220
The intent of the abstinence programs was
to set up a dichotomy with any kind of sexual

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.180
activity on one hand and total abstinence
on the other.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.629
For kids, the lines got a little blurrier.

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:21.780
The researchers said that students were on
an escalator.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.650
“the first step is abstinence.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.370
Then as they begin to be aware of sex, there
are other steps and choices to be made that

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.120
eventually lead to having intercourse.”

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.180
So it’s not surprising that one review by
the US Department of Health and Human Services

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.269
found that none of the individual abstinence
programs they reviewed had statistically significant

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.590
impacts on the rate of sexual abstinence.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.190
So basically teens were having sex whether
or not they were taught abstinence.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.870
At the same time, teens are having sex, they
aren’t using protection.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.310
One study by Columbia University's Mailman
School of Public Health found that from 2003-2007

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.030
contraception use declined.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.870
The researchers think it might be the result
of abstinence only programs which don’t

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.190
mention contraception unless it’s to talk
about how often it fails.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.080
So teens have sex, without protection, and
with sex sometimes comes serious consequences.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.150
One study in PLOS One found a link between
abstinence-only programs and teen pregnancy.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.379
Basically, states that emphasized abstinence
only policies had a higher teen pregnancy

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:16.379
rate.

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.880
The researchers concluded that comprehensive
sex and/or STI education that includes abstinence

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.790
as the best way to go was correlated with
the lowest teen pregnancy rates.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.939
And a lot of other developed nations provide
comprehensive sex ed and have low rates of

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:29.939
teen pregnancy.

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:33.769
To learn more about how other countries teach
sex to their teenagers, check out this great

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:34.769
video from TestTube.

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.010
Alright so the question is, what was your
sex ed class like?

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.280
Was it all “if you have sex, you will get
chlamydia and die”.?

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.280
I had horrible sex-ed.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.400
We had someone come in a tell us that when
you have sex, oxytocin is released in a woman’s

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.269
brain that binds her to her partner.

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.090
Which yeah oxytocin is called the love hormone
for a reason.. but then the teacher went on

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.520
to say that oxytocin is like tape, the more
you use it, the less sticky it gets.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.470
so basically the more people you have sex
with, the less you’ll get attached to them.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:52.470
Which is just… well bullshit.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.460
Anyways tell us your story down in the comments
below.
