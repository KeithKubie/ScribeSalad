# How Many Countries are There?

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.480
How many countries are there?

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.120
Easy: just grab a map and start counting,
yes?

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.120
No.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.620
Not all maps are created equal -- borders
will differ depending on who you got the map

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:09.620
from.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.169
So if individuals disagree, then surely a
committee will save the day.

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:15.909
Go to the United Nations, find the room where
countries sit -- each with a little name tag

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:17.770
-- start counting and get an answer.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.860
Now of course, countries come and countries
go, but at the time this video was made the

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.740
answer is 193.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:24.970
Fastest video ever, right?

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.140
Except: you know this isn't over.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.949
The United Nations list is less a complete
class roster than a club membership that doesn't

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:30.949
include everyone.

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.550
Take, Vatican City who is a country but is
too cool for school when it comes to being

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:35.739
a member of the United Nations.

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.800
And while Vatican City's exact situation is…
complicated he's straightforward compared

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.829
to other non-United Nations countries… or
places -- the terminology is going to have

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.360
a be a bit, unclear here.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.460
Take Kosovo, who want's to join the UN club,
but membership requires none of these five

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.809
countries to reject you.

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.210
And while the United States, The United Kingdom
and France think Kosovo is a country, Russia

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.570
and China think she's just a rebellious part
of Serbia and so veto her membership.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.859
As for everyone else, just over half recognize
Kosovo as independent and Kosovo, adorably,

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:05.660
has a website where she thanks each one in
their own language.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.620
But Kosovo, is not there only other… place
that wants to be considered a real country.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.390
There's Transnistria, Nagorno-Karabakh Republic,
Abkhazia, and South Ossetia.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.800
Which might, or might not, be part of Moldova,
Azerbaijan or Georgia depending on who you

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.800
ask.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.350
Two of these… countries, no UN members recognize
as countries, and other two have only five

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.350
supporters.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.780
Though all four of these... places recognize
each other as countries.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.330
There's also The Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic
and Northern Cyprus each with their own supporters.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.330
At this point you might be thinking 'OK, srsly,
what's the deal?

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.780
I don't care who these guys think are countries,
are these places countries or not?'

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.390
If I fly to one for a Holliday, will it *look*
like a country when I get there?

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.190
The answer is, 'maybe'.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.130
These... countries are all autonomous, to
some extent, with governments that issue passports

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.160
though these may be of rather limited use
and depending on which ones you're visiting

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.430
they may have more or less control of the
territory they claim as theirs.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.590
You won't always find a clear border.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.980
What makes many of these places... fuzzy is
they're *usually* born of conflict in the

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:04.980
recent-ish past.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.390
That answer is probably less helpful than
you want so think of it like this: while The

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.140
United States is clearly a country now, in
1776, not so much.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.689
Then she was just an idea in minds of rebel
scum.

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:18.439
She wasn't recognized as a country instantly
and without diplomatic effort to change that

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:21.129
Young America would never have made it on
her own.

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:25.189
Much like what happened a century later when
she got her own rebel who, unlike elder sister,

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:28.060
failed in the diplomacy department so… yeah.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.230
And so it goes today with many of the maybe
countries in the world.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.379
Maybe they're future United States and maybe
they're future Confederacies -- but in the

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.140
moment it's hard to say -- because these things
can take decades to settle.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.159
By the way, these maybe-countries are super
awkward for countries to deal with.

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.000
While your tiny island nation might not want
to get involved in the affairs of distant

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.260
lands you still have to decide to send a diplomat,
or not -- meaning even inaction forces you

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.710
to pick a side in *every territorial skirmish
in the world*.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:58.159
A notably awkward case being: Taiwan… errr,
sorry, Chinese Taipei which is *totally* part

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:00.849
of China and no one would ever think otherwise…

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:02.879
Is China gone?

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:07.269
OK: by any reasonable definition, Taiwan is
a separate country and has been for years,

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.510
but China won't let go and insists you call
her Chinese Taipei and don't forget who makes

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.690
all your clothing and utensils and TVs and
phones and computers and everything.

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.400
So almost all countries -- including the mighty
United States -- plays along even though they

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.999
unofficially acknowledge Taiwan's independence
and do things that wouldn't make any senses

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:25.750
otherwise -- like sending aircraft carriers
to protect one part of China from another

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.019
part of China.

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.680
Thus the innocent question 'how many countries?'
has led us straight to a big 'World War III:

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.379
Press Here to Start' button which is getting
depressing so lets move on to...

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:35.909
Ohhhh, right.

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:36.909
::sigh::

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:41.640
No more politics: on to higher ideas: The
Olympics.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.060
Surely from their perch among the gods they
have a disinterested view of the countries

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.060
below.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.170
"How many are there, Olympics?"

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.629
Two hundred and four?

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:49.629
Huh.

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:50.739
So Olympics is a bit… special.

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.230
She defines Puerto Rico as a 'country' even
though it's unambiguously part of the United

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.120
States as well as Bermuda and Aruba which
are connected to the UK and The Netherlands

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.129
along with a bunch of other places that are
happy to play in her Olympic Games as Nations

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.400
but make no claims to independence.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.390
Presumably, Olympics includes these to bump
up the number so she can say 'more than 200

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.390
countries compete!'

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.480
Though even her inflated list doesn't include
Vatican City -- because, given his demographics,

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.310
divine intervention would be required to take
home a gold.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.760
And Vatican City brings us right back to the
core of the difficulty with this question:

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.380
a consistent definition of 'country' is impossible
because your checklist needs to both include

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.260
Vatican City the least country-like country
that's still a country -- and that also exclude

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.060
the Anti-Vatican City: Hong Kong: -- the most
country-like country that isn't.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.060
Also don't forget from previous episodes the
seemingly endless territories which look and

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.170
act like independent countries, but just sort
of aren't.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.890
And this isn't even brining up the various
Nutters who plant a flag on an Island, or

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:48.350
an oil rig, start printing currency on their
fancy inkjet and declare Deludtopia a new

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.350
nation.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.090
So with no checklist to follow where does
that leave us?

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.660
The best answer to the question 'how many
countries' for the forceable future is probably

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.590
to say 'around 200' and leave it at that.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.340
An answer with more significant figures implies
more agreement than there really is -- because

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.320
ultimately, what makes a country a country
is if other countries think that country is

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:24.370
a country.
