00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.740
This looks like a deck of cards, it feels
like a deck of cards, and it even handles

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.180
like a deck of cards. But this little gadget
has a very shocking secret. In this project,

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.540
you'll see how Stuart Edge, was able to give
these lucky ladies, an electrifying first

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:23.860
kiss.

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.360
For this project, we're turning a cheap disposable
camera, into an electric shocker that's been

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.060
disguised as an innocent looking deck of cards.
Your audience will have no idea there's over

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:54.640
300 volts of electricity pumping through it.
The secret is in this modified shocker circuit

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.680
hiding just under the surface. It's powered
by a single AAA battery, and has a dial for

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.890
cranking up the voltage. Taking a couple of
cards from the stack reveals the hidden electrodes,

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.719
and you can see they're charged with nearly
330 volts DC. If both of the pads are touched,

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:15.310
it shoots out a wicked jolt of electricity.
You might get a better idea of how this feels,

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.650
if we use the device to charge a capacitor
and touch some metal.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.380
Of course, in the kissing trick,
the power is significantly less, but still

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.160
high enough, to feel the magic. Ok, to make
this gadget, Stuart gave me a fresh deck of

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.680
cards, and some spares from his other kissing
pranks. I also picked up this disposable camera

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.500
from the photo center of a local drug store.
This one was used, and in their recycling

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.100
bin along with hundreds of others, so I got
it for free. If you want to find the exact

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.619
same style, just look for this model number
printed on the casing. Alright, let's get

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.659
inside this thing by breaking the front panel
off, and this should expose the circuit board.

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.040
Now there's a good chance you'll get shocked
if you try this bare handed, but releasing

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.790
the board is as simple as pushing the plastic
catch to the side, and pulling upward. This

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.650
is the circuit that drives the camera flash.
The various components are powered with a

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:14.100
AA battery and work together to charge this
330 volt capacitor, which you can see stores

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.989
a pretty nasty shock. Now we could use this by
itself, but it's way too big to hide in a

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.980
deck of cards. To do that, we'll have to reverse
engineer the schematics, and shrink it down

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.709
a lot. We can use something like a desoldering
iron to remove the 5 components we'll need,

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:34.300
and I've switched out the AA battery with
a smaller AAA battery to work with this schematic.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.640
Now this is the tricky part. We don't have
room for bulky wires, so we'll need to solder

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.629
everything directly to the pins on the transformer.

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:43.220
In a way that keeps the components in line,

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.540
while maintaining a low profile.
For convenience in changing out the batteries,

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.300
let's incorporate a AAA battery holder. I'm
also adding a 1Mega Ohm tuning potentiometer,

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.180
so we'll be able to adjust the intensity of
the electric shock. This pot has 3 legs, but

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.300
we only need 2, so let's trim the one on the
right. Ok, it's time to add some wire, and

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.780
I scavenged this thin cable from some scrap
electronics We'll just need to strip the ends,

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.470
and solder them in place. This is a good time
to connect the potentiometer just behind the

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.360
diode, so the dial is flush with the top.
Now let's solder the shocker circuit to the

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.930
battery holder so we end up with one wire
that attaches to battery positive, and an

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.069
additional wire that attaches to battery negative,
and then continues on out. The circuitry here

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.780
is streamlined and looking good, but it's
very fragile, so I've wrapped a bit of paper

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.920
around the edges to make a form, for adding
copious amounts of hot-glue. I'm hoping this will seep

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.379
down into the gaps, and give the shocker circuit
more durability. That will need to cool for

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:45.849
about 5 minutes, then we can peel off the
paper, and add a little more glue to any parts

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:51.300
that got missed. To finish it up, I gave it
a new paper jacket, and a bit of black ink.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.879
Well that completes the shocker circuit, so
now it's time to rig the deck. I'm thinking

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:59.610
the best place to conceal the shocker will
be near the back, and it looks like it could

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.049
be be a tight fit, but it should work. These
components, are shorter than the deick and

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:09.629
stand about 40 cards high. That means there
are 12 cards here that won't need any modification,

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:13.640
but these other ones, are gonna need to
be cut. Since there are so many cards to cut,

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.019
I made this plastic template to use as a cutting guide.
Holding the card firmly in place, we can use

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.870
something like a razor, or this hobby knife
to make the cuts. I've also done this with

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.669
scissors, but it's harder, and the result
isn't as clean. Alright, we've got 40 cards

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:32.909
modified, and a quick alignment on the edges,
shows that the containment area is fairly

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:38.110
uniform. Now we'll need to grab a new card,
and mark where the circuit is gonna sit.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.529
I've cut a 1/4" hole because we need some
stealthy electrodes, that will be smooth and

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:47.139
lie flat so they can't be detected. I'll be
using this piece of conductive foil tape,

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.939
that you could get at the hardware store.
You can see here how the tape gets folded

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:55.249
inside the card, and once in position, it
can be trimmed, and smoothed out with a firm

00:04:55.249 --> 00:05:00.129
piece of plastic, like a credit card, or a
hotel room key. The other electrodes gets

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:04.619
added on the opposite side, making sure there's
a good gap between the two, and the finished

00:05:04.619 --> 00:05:10.050
base should look like this. The last 3 steps,
are to trim up the wires so they're held in

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.449
firm contact with the conductive metal tape,
add a bit of hot glue to the underside of

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:19.809
the unit, and reinforce the connections to
ensure they won't pull apart. Now the circuit

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:24.180
is ready for operation, and when a battery
is inserted, this will deliver a continuous

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.050
electric shock to anyone that makes contact
with the metal tape. The modified cards turned

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.189
out to be a perfect fit, and since nothing
is glued in place, they can move freely, to

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:37.210
give the illusion that it's just a normal
deck. Now, if you're concerned about accidentally

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.589
shocking yourself, you can reduce the risk
by placing a card or two over the shocker

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:47.219
pads. The remaining cards stack on top, and
our modification is complete. What's really

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:51.949
cool about this, is it even fits back in the
original packaging. But just for fun, Stuart

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:56.649
picked up a little nicer carrying case. This
gives the trick a slightly more professional

00:05:56.649 --> 00:06:00.809
look, and makes it 100% ready, for his "electric
shock kissing prank".

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:07.099
To get the sparks flying, you can see Stuart holds one end of the shocker
pad, and uses his magic trick as a decoy,

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:11.610
to get his volunteer to hold the other side.
The circuit will complete when they touch,

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.590
and if the touch happens to be a kiss .. they
feel the magic.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:23.040
Well there you have it. Now you know how to convert a simple deck of cards,
into a stealthy secret shocker. If you like
