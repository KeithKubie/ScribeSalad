[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.680
SAMUEL LEVIN: When I was
16 I came home from school.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.820
And I sat down at
the dinner table.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.070
And I put my head in my hands.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.850
And I said, you know what,
I can't take it anymore.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.140
And the problem was
that it seemed to me

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.820
that pretty much everyone
around me was unhappy.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.730
So I went to a public school
in Western Massachusetts.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.820
I was in my junior year.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.030
And it seemed to me that
pretty much all of my friends

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.520
were going through their
days disengaged, not happy,

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.405
and not learning much.

00:00:40.405 --> 00:00:45.450
And they looked
like sort of drones.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.260
I'd go to school,
and they looked

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.050
like they were being
passed through the day,

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.340
by bell after bell,
worksheet after worksheet,

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.320
and then going home
to do their homework.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.230
They just seemed like lifeless.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.730
That's not to say all the time.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.390
They had their
moments of greatness,

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.690
and a good teacher,
or a good project.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.890
But most of the time they
just seemed pretty miserable,

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:06.390
my friends.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.500
And I myself, I
was pretty happy.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.280
I liked school.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.650
I was a school person.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.270
I had a few teachers I liked.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.950
Plenty I didn't.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.090
But I was pretty content.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.450
But what was driving me crazy
was that so many of my friends

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:23.700
just seemed miserable.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.860
And I suppose that
would have been OK

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.560
if in spite of being miserable
they were becoming enlightened.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.120
So maybe you just got to buckle
down and be unhappy for four

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.080
years in order to learn, right?

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.160
But the problem was
they didn't really

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.640
seem to be learning either.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.460
They weren't coming
out the other end of it

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.080
with all sorts of knowledge,
or gaining enlightenment

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.730
in a way that would allow
them to lead better lives,

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.930
or be more thoughtful people,
or make better decisions.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.090
And so there was that.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.150
And even that might have
been OK if I just thought,

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.470
well, you know what,
high schoolers suck.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.200
I mean, we high schoolers,
we like to play video games,

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.120
and spend all our time
online, and on social media.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.290
And we can't really expect
high schoolers to learn much.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.010
You know, they're just kind
of rebels, or whatever.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.730
But I knew that wasn't the
case, because for three years

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.440
previously when I
was a freshman I had

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.330
started a garden at my school.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.160
And it was a student
run garden that

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.650
grew food for the cafeterias
in our school district.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.969
And in the garden
I saw the opposite

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:38.260
of what I saw in the classroom.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.100
In the garden I saw kids showing
up at 6:00 in the morning

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.150
to harvest vegetables
for the cafeteria.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.940
Not getting credit,
or money, or anything.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.550
I saw them giving up
their weekends to work,

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.660
to harvest, and weed, and water.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.530
I saw them going all
through the summer,

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.420
skipping sports, family
dinners, whatever, all of that

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.140
because they had committed to
this idea of changing the way

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.890
our school ate.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.520
So I knew that high schoolers
had enormous potential,

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.580
that when they put
their minds to something

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.010
they couldn't be stopped.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.510
So that's what
really began to eat

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:14.090
at me was the mismatch between
the lifeless people I saw

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.570
in the classroom who had to
be cajoled into just writing

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.770
their name on a piece of
paper and then the ones

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.870
I saw getting up at 6:00 in the
morning to go out in the cold

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.140
and pick raspberries.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.050
And that really began to
just drive me up the wall.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.690
And so that day I came home
and I said, you know mom,

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:35.930
it's so crazy to me.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.000
It doesn't make any sense,
and I can't take it anymore.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.789
And was expecting her to
be like, oh well, you know,

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:43.330
suck it up, or
whatever, that's life.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:44.121
That's high school.

00:03:44.121 --> 00:03:47.465
You'll get to college one
day and that'll be fun.

00:03:47.465 --> 00:03:48.090
But she didn't.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.900
She turned to me and said,
OK, then why don't you

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.390
start your own school.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.560
And I began to think,
OK, maybe I will.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.480
And so I started to spend my
junior year of high school

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.380
thinking that I
could actually start

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.560
a school within my high school
in Western Massachusetts.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.540
And I began to
think, well, maybe we

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:11.650
could do it differently.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.790
Maybe we could change
things so that we

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.720
could see what I
saw in the garden,

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.560
and on the basketball court,
and in the baseball field,

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.500
we could see that
in the classroom.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.815
And the big idea that began to
occur to me in my junior year,

00:04:24.815 --> 00:04:29.320
as I started to plan this
and design this new school,

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.360
was that the difference between
what I saw in the garden

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.740
and what I saw in the classroom
came down to autonomy.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.500
Because in the garden
we were the owners.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.900
It was our thing.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.140
It was our garden.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.010
We were responsible for it.

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.610
And no one was
telling us to do it.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.920
No one was there to save us
from it when things went wrong.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.290
It was ours.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.850
And in the classroom
us 14 to 18 year olds,

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.230
adolescents, becoming
adults, we had no autonomy.

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.250
We were being told what
to learn, how to learn it,

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.900
then given a test to be told
whether we had learned it

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.960
or not.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.760
So it began to occur to me that
there was no wonder that we

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.470
weren't engaged.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:13.980
It was no wonder that
we weren't passionate.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.380
It was no wonder that
we weren't finding

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.800
things we were excited about.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.600
Because we were at
a time in our lives

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.530
when we craved more than
anything autonomy, and yet

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.000
we were being
given the opposite.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
We were having our lives
completely structured

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.670
within the school day.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:34.580
And so I began to think
that if I did start a school

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.210
it would be a
student run school.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.324
Yeah.

00:05:38.324 --> 00:05:38.990
SUSAN ENGEL: OK.

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.280
I'll tell my side of the story.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.139
When Sam walked in that day
and sat down on the table

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:45.680
and put his head in
his hands, I mean

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.330
he really looked miserable.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.080
And he looked furious.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.150
But that wasn't the
first time I had seen

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.090
a kid frustrated at school.

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.370
First of all, Sam is the
youngest of my three sons.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.960
And they all went to
a local public school.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.300
And I had heard so many
stories on so many afternoons.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.960
The good thing
and the bad thing.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.180
The wonderful chance
to write a cool story.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.020
The terrible time a teacher
unfairly graded a test.

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.630
The victory in a
basketball game.

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.790
And the cool mural painted
on a wall, but also

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.690
the mean teacher
who sent you out

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.350
to the whatever, the bad office.

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.880
And all along I
thought to myself, OK,

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.460
you take the bad with the good.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.940
Overall it's a
pretty good thing.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.270
And it's what it is.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.530
It's what high school has to be.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.910
On that day when he came home
so filled with frustration

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:41.200
and so filled with disgust
at the disparity between what

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.820
he had seen in the
garden and what

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:51.570
he saw going on in the
hallways in his school

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:55.520
I had sort of a series
of light bulb moments.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.180
The first light bulb was that we
had been distracted as a nation

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.760
by the idea of the super
highs and the super lows.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.040
So everybody knows about
the desperate stories

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.420
of children who are so
miserable or so marginalized

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.970
at school that they drop
out, that they give up,

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:14.110
that they do something terrible.

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:18.540
And on the other hand, the super
highs, the victorious kids who,

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:22.660
against all odds, succeed
or do something fantastic.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.900
And as a country
we had forgotten

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.230
to think about the vast middle.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:30.210
We had assumed that that was
OK, that as long as you got by,

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.100
as long as you got a few good
grades or one fun basketball

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.950
game, it would be OK.

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:39.480
And that that was a
terrible mistake, because OK

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.010
was not good enough.

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:45.100
The second light bulb moment
I had came from the fact

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.840
that I'm a developmental
psychologist.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.420
So I know quite a bit about
the most contemporary research

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.330
on what adolescents are
like, what they need,

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.320
what the pitfalls are.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.970
And I realized during
that light bulb moment

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:00.620
that high school is
almost perfectly designed

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.210
to be the opposite of what
high schoolers are like

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:04.520
and what they need.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.350
And that, in fact,
high schools spend

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:10.840
most of their time, teachers,
administrators, school policy

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.680
makers, thinking
of ways to limit

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.390
what they see as the potential
disasters of adolescence.

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:22.070
Whatever you can do to keep
kids from running wild.

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:24.470
Whatever you can do to make
them sit in their seat.

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:27.710
Whatever you can do to keep them
from ganging up with each other

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:29.440
and doing bad things.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.860
And whatever you can do to
keep them out of control.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:36.690
And in spending so much energy
and time thinking about ways

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:40.720
to limit the negative
potential of teenagers,

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.640
they had neglected
to think about what

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.730
you could do to design an
environment that would make

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:47.980
the most of the
incredible potential

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.870
of the adolescent
period of life.

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.730
Because, in fact,
it is arguably one

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:56.390
of the two most important
developmental phases

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:57.860
of our whole lives.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:00.630
Maybe sort of infancy
and toddlerhood

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:04.830
is one, where you learn to walk,
and navigate the social world,

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:07.070
and you begin to
understand symbols.

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:09.390
I mean, an enormous
amount goes on then.

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:13.280
And then again in adolescence
this major transformation

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.410
takes place.

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:18.290
And we had sort of ignored
it in our high schools.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:20.610
And that led to the
third light bulb,

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:24.890
which is that, in fact, there
is this huge transformation that

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:26.750
happens during adolescence.

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.960
You start high school, you're
still pretty much a kid.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.370
And in our culture you're
treated like a kid,

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:34.460
without the freedom
of responsibility,

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:38.460
and also the openness and
the privileges of childhood.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.940
And yet, by the time
you leave high school

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:45.360
we expect you to be well
on your way to adulthood.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.810
After all, by the time
you're 18 you can vote.

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:50.370
You can legally get married.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:57.000
You're supposed to be somewhere
on the path to choosing

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
a professional life or
a professional identity.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.220
And not to mention the fact that
we would happily send you off

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.840
to fight in a war,
and kill people and be

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.760
killed for your country.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.100
That's at 18.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.810
At 16 we hardly let
you do anything.

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:16.110
And, in fact, as Sam
said, we don't even

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:17.470
trust you to tell time.

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:19.720
We ring a bell when you
should get up out of your seat

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.690
and go to the next activity.

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:24.740
And suddenly it
made no sense to me

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:28.400
that adolescents should
be squandered in that way,

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.580
or neglected in that way.

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.640
Which is why I was so
interested to watch

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.420
him develop this school.

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.140
SAMUEL LEVIN: And in a
much less articulate way,

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:42.650
I began to be frustrated
by all of these things too.

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:46.010
And in my junior year
as I started to think,

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:49.080
well, we could have
a student run school,

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.990
and if we did that students
would be making choices

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:54.860
and so therefore engaged and
really able to learn things.

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:57.220
They could learn to be
responsible, and learn

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:00.960
to dig deeply into
things, as opposed

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.090
to just be told to flip
from subject to subject.

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:04.506
I began to think
all these things.

00:11:04.506 --> 00:11:10.100
It also occurred to me
that I couldn't just

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.600
think about it, that this
actually had to happen.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.060
I actually had to start school.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:18.590
And so that's what I set about
doing in my junior year was

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:20.440
going to my school
and saying, listen,

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.286
I'm going to start a
student run school here.

00:11:23.286 --> 00:11:24.910
And of course they
just said, OK, fine,

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:27.021
that makes sense,
and let me do it.

00:11:27.021 --> 00:11:27.520
No.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.310
So, of course, as a public
school it wasn't that easy.

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:34.140
There was a lot of
backlash, because I

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:36.946
said we should start
a student run school.

00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:38.570
And they said that's
the craziest thing

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:39.278
we've ever heard.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:44.350
But I started going
through that process,

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:46.700
meeting after meeting,
curriculum steering committee,

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.290
school board, parents,
teachers, everyone,

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:52.990
to try to say, listen, look
at how much doesn't make sense

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:54.150
about what we do.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:56.230
Look at how much we
know about adolescence

00:11:56.230 --> 00:12:00.230
and what we could achieve if
we made some simple changes.

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:05.639
But also to say, look
at what we're doing now.

00:12:05.639 --> 00:12:06.930
Look how many kids are failing.

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:09.060
Look how many kids
who are "succeeding"

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:12.540
are getting almost nothing
out of this process.

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:13.810
And yet still I got backlash.

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:17.620
To give you a little
example, in, I don't know,

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:21.990
my thousandth meeting with this
curriculum steering committee I

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:23.820
was going on saying,
well, you know,

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.719
I had gone to them
so many times before.

00:12:25.719 --> 00:12:28.010
And each time they'd sent me
back to the drawing board.

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:30.040
And I'd come back to
them saying, well,

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.140
what about this, and
what if we do this?

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:34.890
And one teacher was
getting so frustrated,

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:38.430
he was getting visibly
red in the face.

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:41.970
And finally, late in the
meeting he just blurted out,

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.600
you know what, it's
ridiculous to think

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:48.600
that high schoolers could be
trusted to learn on their own.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.520
And I think that just paints a
picture of the kind of response

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:53.270
that we got.

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:56.810
But meeting after
meeting, day after day,

00:12:56.810 --> 00:13:01.300
month after month, we
convinced them to do it.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:06.610
And so in my senior year,
the fall of my senior year,

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:09.590
we got eight students from
all different backgrounds,

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:13.200
kids who were planning to drop
out, getting straight F's,

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.120
to straight A
students who planned

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.830
to go to the top colleges to
come together and take charge

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:21.205
of their high school education.

00:13:21.205 --> 00:13:22.580
SUSAN ENGEL: So
one of the things

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:24.831
that fascinated me, so Sam
would come home from school

00:13:24.831 --> 00:13:26.080
and say, you can't believe it.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.670
They said we can't do this.

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:29.250
Or it won't work.

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:31.060
Or the teachers
won't let us do it.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:34.080
And I began to
notice actually it

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.010
comes down to a very simple
idea, how afraid grownups are

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:38.740
of teenagers.

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:44.080
And I began to think about
what was driving that fear.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.040
And I'm just going
to name a few.

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:50.220
One of their fears, and I've
referred to this before,

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:54.180
is that teenagers left to
their own devices, left

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:58.660
to learn on their own,
you'll have total anarchy.

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.170
That they won't
follow any rules,

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:04.030
that they won't have any plans,
that they won't do any work.

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:06.770
And, in fact, all
of the research

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:09.300
shows, in a famous
study where students

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:12.620
had little beepers that
beeped them throughout the day

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:16.410
to find out what they were
doing, who they were with,

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:18.190
what kind of project
they were doing,

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:19.590
or activity they
were doing, what

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:21.070
they were feeling and thinking.

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:24.440
That research shows that
actually, when teenagers

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.820
have a choice over
what they're doing,

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:29.950
they are their most engaged,
their most purposeful,

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:32.000
their most hardworking,
and their most

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.450
interested in taking
on serious challenges.

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:37.780
So, in fact, it's not as
if giving students a choice

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:40.590
makes them dive into
chaos and anarchy.

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:41.580
Quite the opposite.

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:42.590
It makes them focus.

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:44.970
It makes them try hard.

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:48.090
As a second example,
there's a terrible fear

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:50.290
that if teenagers
get together, they'll

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:52.820
just cause a lot of damage.

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.700
And as I mentioned
before, there's

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:57.940
a lot of effort put on keeping
kids apart from each other.

00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:59.840
They can have five
minutes between classes

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:02.250
to walk down the hall,
but then they separate.

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:04.620
Don't sit too near one another.

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:06.714
You can work a little bit,
but don't work together

00:15:06.714 --> 00:15:08.880
a little bit, but don't
work too much because you'll

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.830
borrow each other's ideas.

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:15.260
All of the research shows that,
I mean you must find this here,

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.880
when students can work
with someone they like,

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.720
they do better work.

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:22.520
When teenagers are in
the company of peers

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.340
they do take more risks,
but many of those risks

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.010
are good risks.

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:28.970
And in some settings
we see that as one

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:33.260
of the goals of education,
learning how to take a risk.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.430
One of the other things that
scared the grownups that Sam

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:39.280
was talking to was the
idea that grownups would

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.360
become useless, or irrelevant.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.980
Because if teenagers
were learning together,

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:46.380
what would the grownups do?

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:50.870
In fact, we know from research
that the most important role--

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:53.500
Adults are very important
during adolescent development.

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:55.560
We've known this
since Erik Erikson

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:58.140
in the beginning of
the 20th century.

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:02.510
Teenagers need adult role models
that are not their parents.

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:05.732
But actually by
changing the role, which

00:16:05.732 --> 00:16:07.440
I think Sam is going
to tell you a little

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:10.510
more about, by changing
the role of adults

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:13.430
you free them from
being minders,

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:15.440
and keepers, and
disciplinarians,

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:20.270
and you find a way to let them
actually be mentors and develop

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:21.620
mutual relationships.

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:25.490
That's what the research shows
teenagers need, relationships

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:27.050
with grownups.

00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:29.580
Not to be watched over.

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:32.130
Finally, one of the
fears that the grownups

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:34.550
had in Sam's school,
and grownups ever

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:37.070
since as we've talked
about this idea,

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:40.610
is that if you took them out of
the regular conventional school

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:44.290
system, they'd miss
something very important.

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:46.670
How would they keep up with
their English, or their math,

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:50.640
or whatever it is that the
conventional school was

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:51.420
offering them?

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:55.160
It might create such a
gap in their education.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.220
And what's remarkable
about that, if you

00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:01.104
look across the country at the
data we have about schools,

00:17:01.104 --> 00:17:02.520
is that it turns
out they wouldn't

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:05.030
be missing very much at all.

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:08.210
The data on what kids learn
in a given semester or a year

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:09.619
are not very impressive.

00:17:09.619 --> 00:17:12.910
And the less a kid likes the
school, the less impressive

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:14.270
their learning is.

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:17.109
So, in fact, it's hard
for me to understand quite

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:23.190
why grownups feel so much
fear at the idea of students

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:25.608
choosing their own education.

00:17:25.608 --> 00:17:27.640
SAMUEL LEVIN: And I
think one thing that

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:32.190
happened that semester was
we showed how many of those

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:34.280
fears were unfounded.

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:38.300
So we set out in the
fall of my senior year

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.740
and ran our own school.

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:41.450
And the setup was simple.

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:45.240
We had our afternoons set aside
for an individual endeavor,

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:47.660
which meant that you could
do anything you wanted,

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:49.750
as long as it could
take the whole time.

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:52.730
It was meaty, and you
were excited to do it.

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:53.460
Build a boat.

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:54.180
Write a book.

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:56.070
Whatever.

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:59.000
And in the mornings
we did academics.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.010
So we did the sciences,
where you ask questions,

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:06.610
and the languages, the
mathematical and English

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:09.240
languages where we read books,
chose books for each other,

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.300
wrote, read our reading
aloud to each other,

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:14.650
and explored exciting
math problems.

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:20.410
And to paint a little picture
of what that was like,

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:26.780
I'll tell you a story from the
very beginning of that school.

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:30.800
So we started out with doing
the sciences in the morning.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.747
And the idea was
everyone would come up

00:18:32.747 --> 00:18:34.830
with their own natural and
social science question

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:35.990
to start the week.

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:38.450
And then you'd spend that
week pursuing the answer,

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:42.800
reading books, talking to
teachers, experts, whatever.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.430
And then on Friday you'd teach
it to the rest of the group.

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:48.750
And as we started out,
it was really exciting.

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:50.920
Everyone was coming up
with their questions.

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:54.050
Oh, I want to know
why crying evolved.

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:59.360
Or I want to know what really
initiated World War II.

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.040
That kind of stuff.

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.290
And yet there was one student
who I was worried about.

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:04.620
We were just getting started.

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:08.530
I just spent an entire
year convincing my school

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:10.340
and everyone that
we could do this.

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:11.090
But I didn't know.

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:12.850
I mean, it could
have been a disaster,

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:13.933
and it would all be on me.

00:19:13.933 --> 00:19:15.900
So I was nervous.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:17.580
And there was one
student who had

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:19.490
his older brother dropped out.

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:21.340
He was planning to drop out.

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:23.090
He didn't do well in classes.

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:25.460
He didn't get along
with his teachers.

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:26.480
And I was worried.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.130
You know, in those
first weeks he

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:31.390
was sort of sitting
there looking kind

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:32.759
of grumpy and disinterested.

00:19:32.759 --> 00:19:35.050
And I was worried, what if
he just doesn't do anything?

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:35.966
What if they're right?

00:19:35.966 --> 00:19:39.670
What if when they said, oh, some
kids just don't have interests,

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:41.760
they were right?

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:47.220
And so that first day of
question asking everyone

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:51.870
had gone, and it got to
Rix, who was the kid.

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:54.250
And he just didn't say anything.

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:58.070
And everyone was like
Rix, what about you man?

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:01.170
And he was like,
don't have anything.

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:03.080
And, you know, Tim was
like, well, come on.

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.820
We all thought of
questions over the weekend.

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:06.028
You've got to have something.

00:20:06.028 --> 00:20:08.110
And he's like nope.

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:11.340
And then another
student said, well,

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:12.840
you must be interested
in something.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:13.840
What are you interested?

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.310
And he said, nope, not
interested in anything.

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:18.250
And I was like, oh, here we go.

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:18.750
Yep.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:21.540
I was wrong.

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:24.200
And then his friend,
surprisingly,

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.220
who was someone who I
never would have guessed

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:28.886
would be the person to speak up,
because he was also someone who

00:20:28.886 --> 00:20:31.870
didn't like school, he said,
well, what about that book

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:33.720
you were looking at earlier?

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.339
You know, that
copy of Sam's book.

00:20:35.339 --> 00:20:36.380
You were looking at that.

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.379
So you must have been
pretty interested in that.

00:20:38.379 --> 00:20:41.600
And I was like, what
book is he talking about?

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.380
And then I remembered,
I was reading

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:45.500
"A Brief History of Time."

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:53.020
And Rix said, well, yeah, I
mean, I guess like infinity

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:53.920
and space and stuff.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.330
That's kind of interesting.

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:59.640
And I was hit with two
different emotions at once.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:04.050
I was so excited that Rix
was interested in something.

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:05.490
I was like, yes, great.

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:09.000
And then I was like, oh
no, too bad it's something

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.420
so impossibly complex
that he could never

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:14.580
make any progress on it.

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:18.230
And for a split second I
thought about saying, well,

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:19.990
maybe not for this first week.

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:21.630
Maybe what do you think, you
should try something else?

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:23.046
And then I thought,
you know what,

00:21:23.046 --> 00:21:24.624
that's not the point of this.

00:21:24.624 --> 00:21:27.040
The point of this is for people
to pursue their interests.

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:29.370
I don't want to make him
decide he's not interested.

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:33.720
And so I didn't say anything.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.000
And the week went along.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.490
And everyone else, I'd
see John racing off

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:42.280
with a stack full of
books to the library,

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:46.220
or Dakota coming in with muddy
boots and a bag full of leaves

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:48.610
that she had collected.

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:51.670
And yet, day by day,
I saw Rix sitting

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:55.730
in the corner with the same
textbook, in the same spot,

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:59.500
on the same page, looking
over and over again.

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:03.000
And I worried.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:09.780
Then one day I went
over-- Oh, so one day I

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:11.730
noticed that my
book was missing,

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:13.460
my "Brief History of Time."

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:14.692
And I saw Rix at lunch.

00:22:14.692 --> 00:22:16.275
And he said, yo, I
borrowed your book.

00:22:16.275 --> 00:22:18.750
And I was like, OK,
well, what do you think?

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:21.315
And he's like, I don't
know, it's confusing.

00:22:21.315 --> 00:22:23.440
And I was like, well, do
you want to talk about it?

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:26.049
I mean, yeah, when I read
it, I couldn't really-- I've

00:22:26.049 --> 00:22:27.090
had to read it two times.

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:29.430
You know, I find it
pretty confusing too.

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:31.330
I don't really get it.

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:32.860
And he's like no, not really.

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:34.320
I don't want to talk about it.

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:38.870
And then Friday came, and we had
our very first day of teaching.

00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:41.570
And everyone stood up
there and taught us.

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:45.140
And John scribbled the
chalk boards, covered them

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:45.780
with notes.

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:49.490
And Dakota dumped
her bags of leaves

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:52.270
and explained the
hypothesis she had.

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:53.620
And I sat there just amazed.

00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:56.880
I had never seen
kids look so excited

00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:00.550
and engaged standing at
the front of a classroom.

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:02.390
But all along I sat
there thinking, well,

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:04.410
what's going to
happen when Rix goes?

00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:05.715
And finally it was his turn.

00:23:05.715 --> 00:23:06.840
And everyone turned to him.

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:11.930
And he had his pants
were sagging down.

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:14.720
And he sort of
said with a smile,

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:18.350
he was like, well, I guess
I'm supposed to go now, huh?

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:20.370
And he stood up, and he
sort of tucked his hat

00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:23.090
low over his eyes so we
couldn't really see his face.

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:27.700
And he went up there and he
pulled out a rubber band.

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:31.660
And he said, so I'm going
to explain something

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:34.740
to you called a Mobius strip.

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:37.650
And if I was surprised
to hear the term Mobius

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:42.780
strip coming out of Rix's mouth,
I only had to wait and listen.

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:47.860
Because for the next 40
minutes he began to talk.

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:51.585
And he said, so you can use
this rubber band to understand,

00:23:51.585 --> 00:23:53.530
you know, and he and
he launched into it.

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:56.510
And you could have
heard a pin drop.

00:23:56.510 --> 00:24:00.430
We barely moved in
that whole time.

00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:03.320
And he finally explained
about the big bang.

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:07.830
And then he tried to
explain the difference

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:09.920
between finite and
infinite universes.

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.990
And he said, that part's
real hard to explain.

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:15.164
I tried to explain to
my brother yesterday,

00:24:15.164 --> 00:24:16.330
and he didn't really get it.

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:20.300
So I don't really
even get it anymore.

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:23.900
Or yeah, like so this
might not make any sense,

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:29.350
but there's this hotel, and it's
kind of like an infinite hotel.

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:32.320
And I don't know who started
it, but pretty soon we

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.520
were all clapping.

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:38.650
And, you know, Rix
was embarrassed,

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:40.430
but he was smiling.

00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:42.974
SUSAN ENGEL: So when Sam
would come home from school

00:24:42.974 --> 00:24:44.390
he'd talk about
the different kids

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:46.110
in the independent project,
and tell me who they were,

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:47.151
and what they were doing.

00:24:47.151 --> 00:24:48.780
And when he started
talking about Rix,

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:53.560
you know, the scraggly guy
who's not doing well in school,

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:54.360
I love boys.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.300
I've got three boys.

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:58.710
So I thought, oh my god,
he's probably this great kid.

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:00.100
And no one understands him.

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:04.570
And once again, teachers aren't
giving some boy a fair shake.

00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:06.290
And then one day I
was in school to watch

00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:10.420
a basketball game or something,
and this really grungy

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:13.710
looking boy, with lank
hair, and low pants,

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:19.180
and sort of slumped over,
and not nice looking at all,

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:21.950
and Sam called me over and
said, mom, this is Rix.

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:23.750
Rix, this is my mom.

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:28.230
And I couldn't believe it,
because I thought, this is Rix?

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:30.922
This isn't the kid I
thought I would love,

00:25:30.922 --> 00:25:32.880
and that I thought all
the teachers would love.

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:38.040
In fact, I don't think I would
love him if I were his teacher.

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:42.170
And he reminded me,
this story reminds me

00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:46.070
of the same old story I've
heard again and again,

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:50.110
of a kid who didn't seem
like academic material.

00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:53.250
He wasn't appealing to grownups.

00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:55.850
I knew, as I found out
later, he was from a family

00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:58.350
where there were no
readers or no talkers.

00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:02.000
He probably had parents who
hated school, or even dropped

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:02.960
out of school.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:06.040
So he never expected
to like school.

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:10.700
And he made teachers expect
that they wouldn't like him.

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:14.100
He's the kind of kid that
teachers look at and think,

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:17.470
this kid is not
academic material.

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:22.000
And the next thought they have
is the big mistake in teaching,

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.190
which is they think
this kid is not

00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:27.950
going to do well academically,
so this kid must not

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:29.940
be a thinker.

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:34.330
And that's one of the great
flaws, great mistakes we make,

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:36.870
which is to assume that just
because a kid doesn't look

00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:38.690
like he's going to
do well in school,

00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:40.630
he must not be a thinker.

00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:43.040
The fact is, we know from
a great deal of research,

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:46.910
that every single child
is born a thinker.

00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:51.140
Everybody loves to think
about the world around them.

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:53.320
I just heard today
a conversation

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:56.070
about two little five year
olds having a heated argument

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:59.100
in the back of their car about
the space-time continuum.

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.120
That's not unusual.

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:03.990
And in the first years of
life every kid is a learner.

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:05.600
As I've said, they
learn to talk.

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.510
They learn to navigate
the social world.

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:12.330
They learn all kinds of
rules and complex topics.

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:16.490
As they go on in school, for
many children, a kid like Rix,

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:19.240
that begins to be worn
away, because they're

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.420
taught that if they're
not doing well,

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:23.910
they can't think
about good big topics.

00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:27.940
And Sam, in the moment that
he struggled with Rix's topic,

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:30.850
suffered from the
same kind of doubt

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:32.450
that teachers often suffer from.

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:34.140
Which is when he
thought to himself,

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:36.620
this might be too
complicated for Rix,

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:39.960
it's because he had the
impulse that if you struggle

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:43.400
academically we should give you
something easier to work on.

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:47.260
Because better to be successful
at something easy than struggle

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:48.610
with something hard.

00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:51.730
The mistake there is
to equate easy and hard

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:53.440
with boring and interesting.

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:56.960
Because often the easy tasks we
give kids who struggle are also

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:58.760
boring tasks.

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:01.750
No one likes to work at
something that's boring.

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:05.397
And we turn knowledge
into a ladder, where

00:28:05.397 --> 00:28:06.980
all the boring stuff
is at the bottom,

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:10.280
but you've got to do it to get
to the good stuff at the top.

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:14.640
But if you're a kid in school,
whether you're 8 or 14,

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:17.870
why are you going to want
to get past that bottom rung

00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:18.880
of the ladder?

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:22.270
Who is going to want
to get to infinity

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:25.010
if they have to learn
the number line first,

00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:28.190
and the number
line is difficult?

00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:30.620
Much better to get
interested in infinity,

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:33.520
and then decide that you'll
never understand it completely

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:37.640
if you don't find out more
about the number line.

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:40.990
What Sam and Rix
discovered together

00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:44.520
in the time they
sat together had

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:49.300
to do with realizing
that everybody

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:52.970
is wading into the unknown
when they delve into new ideas,

00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:56.470
that everybody wants to
think about big ideas.

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:58.937
We know this, by the
way, from listening

00:28:58.937 --> 00:29:01.270
to what teenagers talk about
when they're not in school,

00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:05.540
or write songs about, or
like to go to movies about.

00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:09.460
They like to think about love,
and justice, and conflict.

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:11.540
They're interested
in the big ideas.

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:14.660
And you don't need to
know a lot about something

00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:17.070
to begin to think about it.

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:21.460
When Sam said to Rix, I
don't really get it either,

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:24.490
he was making them
an intellectual team,

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:29.700
and he was inviting Rix into
the pleasures of the unknown.

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:32.700
So for Rix, that
period of time when

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:37.720
he struggled to
grasp infinity was

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:41.080
his first, most
authentic experience

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:43.500
of being a true intellectual.

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:45.960
And that's what school should
provide every teenager.

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:52.650
SAMUEL LEVIN: And yeah, so
we carried on that year.

00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:54.810
In our afternoons
we learned what

00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:56.850
it was like to really
master something.

00:29:56.850 --> 00:29:58.350
In the mornings
we discovered what

00:29:58.350 --> 00:30:03.070
it was like to all be
intellectuals together.

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:04.760
And at the end of
it we did something

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:06.750
called the collective
endeavor, which

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:08.830
was planned in for
the last three or four

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:10.190
weeks of the program.

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:13.050
The idea being that in
school we get almost no time

00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:14.390
to truly collaborate.

00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:16.310
We get to do like a
project here or there,

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:18.680
where two people team up to
make a poster or something.

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.610
But we don't get to
make something together,

00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:22.740
to build something as a team.

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:24.740
And the other element of
the collective endeavor

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:27.360
is that it had to have an
impact on our community.

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:30.450
Because somehow we were supposed
to emerge from school being

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:33.170
better citizens, and
yet we almost never

00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:35.290
engage with the outside world.

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:37.280
And so in the end we
had to choose something

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:40.380
to do together as a team that
would have a positive impact

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:42.920
on our community.

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:47.340
And maybe unsurprisingly,
when I turned to everyone,

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:49.090
or we all turned to
each other and decided

00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:51.380
what are we going to talk
about, everyone immediately

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:54.500
said we've got to do
something about education.

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:56.500
Because what they
had discovered they

00:30:56.500 --> 00:31:00.410
wanted to share with every other
high schooler in the world.

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:04.370
And so we made a film
about what we had done

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:06.640
and our year in education.

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:10.860
And we posted it online.

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.700
And we expected maybe
one of our parents

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:15.470
would watch it, or a
friend or something.

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:16.720
SUSAN ENGEL: I would watch it.

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.086
[LAUGHING]

00:31:18.086 --> 00:31:19.960
SAMUEL LEVIN: But people
started to watch it.

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:21.710
And people started to
write to us and say,

00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:25.290
hey, I want to do this
too, teachers, parents,

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:27.110
and most excitingly,
other students.

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:29.850
Saying school's
miserable for me too.

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:30.810
I want to get excited.

00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:32.220
You know, I want
to discover what

00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:35.240
it's like to love learning.

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:39.520
And then that year ended.

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:41.440
I went off to college.

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.410
I moved to England.

00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:46.030
The independent project, which
was the name of the school

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:47.650
carried on.

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:49.143
It's now in its seventh year.

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:54.470
Rix graduated.

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:55.690
He didn't drop out.

00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:59.340
And his individual endeavor
was learning how to cook.

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:03.370
He's now a chef at
a top restaurant.

00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:06.330
And others went on to
college and to pursue careers

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:08.750
in the things that
they had discovered.

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:11.160
And my mom and I
carried on talking.

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:17.650
And we carried on
the conversations

00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:19.850
that started that first
time at the dinner table

00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:23.310
when I sat down and said
I can't take this anymore.

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:25.310
And eventually
those conversations

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:28.120
turned into this book.

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:29.296
Yeah.

00:32:29.296 --> 00:32:32.690
I don't if you want to say
anything about the book.

00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:34.171
SUSAN ENGEL: I want
you to read it.

00:32:34.171 --> 00:32:35.670
SAMUEL LEVIN: So
those conversations

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:37.010
turned into that book.

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:39.880
And the book was a few things.

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:44.170
It was, like I said, the
ideas had began to form,

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:47.870
because we realized this
wasn't just one instance at one

00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:50.430
school, but this was a new
way of thinking about how we

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:52.830
could educate our young people.

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:55.230
The book's also the
story, the nitty gritty

00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:58.040
of what that was like, the
ups and downs, the failures,

00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:59.590
the great moments,
the bad moments,

00:32:59.590 --> 00:33:02.380
the things we did right,
and the things we did wrong.

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:05.570
But maybe most importantly,
or most excitingly,

00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:07.120
the book's also a how to.

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:12.240
Because all those people wrote
to us, from New York City,

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:17.110
to Boise, Idaho, to
Australia, to Spain, saying

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:17.970
we want to do this.

00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:24.070
So it's a how to for how you
can change your own school.

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:27.700
And maybe, for me, I
don't know, most of all,

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:29.550
this may not be the
case for my mom,

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:33.310
but it's about what that
teacher said that day when

00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:34.960
we were first starting out.

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:37.780
When that teacher said
it's ridiculous to think

00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:41.420
that high schoolers could be
trusted to learn on their own.

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:46.030
And that year in education, and
everything that happened after,

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:48.540
really is about the fact that
it's ridiculous to think that

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:49.962
they can't.

00:33:49.962 --> 00:33:50.920
SUSAN ENGEL: Thank you.

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:53.370
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:57.290 --> 00:33:58.140
Hi.

00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:01.700
AUDIENCE: So how would you talk
about the conventional system,

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:05.510
like colleges accepting this
kind of education system.

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:09.880
And how do you relate to
admissions of colleges?

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:13.348
What's the path if
somebody pursues it?

00:34:13.348 --> 00:34:15.389
SAMUEL LEVIN: So I'll
answer from the perspective

00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:17.399
of what we did.

00:34:17.399 --> 00:34:19.440
And I don't know if I need
to repeat the question

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.300
or if it's recorded?

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:20.800
OK.

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.894
So I'll answer from
the perspective of what

00:34:22.894 --> 00:34:24.310
we did in the
independent project,

00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:30.020
and then as a college
professor, my mom can answer.

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:34.219
We conveyed it as is
often done with sort

00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:37.400
of things that are done sort of
outside the traditional path.

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:43.080
So everyone who did it gets
credits equivalent to the time

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:45.090
that they-- for a
semester's worth of credits,

00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:46.320
or whatever it is.

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:50.179
And then actually at our
school we also now send out

00:34:50.179 --> 00:34:53.350
a letter at the front of their
sort of admissions package

00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:55.920
saying this different
thing is here.

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:57.910
We have a student run
school at our school now.

00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:03.050
And giving a sense that these
kids did something different.

00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:06.590
And interestingly
enough, maybe this

00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:08.630
wasn't something we
expected, but it turns out

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:10.660
that almost every
kid who's done it

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:13.240
writes about their individual
endeavor, or at least

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:14.951
their program in
their college essay,

00:35:14.951 --> 00:35:16.700
because for most of
the people who did it,

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:19.620
it becomes the thing that
they're passionate about.

00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:21.411
And so that's an
interesting piece.

00:35:21.411 --> 00:35:23.660
SUSAN ENGEL: So I'll give
you two parts to the answer.

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:25.290
I teach at Williams
College, which

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:28.020
is a very selective college.

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:32.590
And my experience is that
when good students do

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:35.150
really interesting
things in high school,

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:38.430
it only helps their college
application process.

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:40.860
That said, I
honestly don't think

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:43.520
that's the reason to encourage
your kid to do this if you're

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:44.770
a grownup asking the question.

00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:48.870
Because the whole point of
this was that what a terrible

00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:52.880
travesty to squander a
kid's-- for those precious,

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:55.770
incredibly transformative,
powerful years,

00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:57.290
thinking about what comes next.

00:35:57.290 --> 00:36:00.170
Alfie Kohn, the
educator, has this line.

00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:02.300
I know he's been out here
in the Palo Alto area

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:05.540
to talk about this where he
says, how much damage are you

00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:07.400
willing to do to
your child to ensure

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:10.010
that they get into a
marginally better college?

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:15.380
And I think that's a
point well said, taken.

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:17.520
But I would also
say more broadly

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:20.550
that one of the
things that is most

00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:22.250
exciting about the
independent project

00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:24.230
is its firm
commitment to the idea

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:26.030
that kids of all
backgrounds and abilities

00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:28.980
can learn together, that they
can be intellectuals together,

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:30.970
that that's for everybody.

00:36:30.970 --> 00:36:33.090
And one reason I
bring that up is

00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:36.147
many of the kids who thrive
in this kind of environment,

00:36:36.147 --> 00:36:38.480
some are the kids who are
going to go to a great college

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:39.390
anyway.

00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:41.800
And many of them from the
independent project have.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:43.430
They would either way.

00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:45.350
Many of them might
not go to college

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:47.870
at all if they weren't in
the independent project.

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:50.180
And then the
question isn't which

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:52.760
is the best college
they're going to get into,

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:55.820
but can you get them to
want to go to college?

00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:57.930
Can you get them to
see that learning is

00:36:57.930 --> 00:37:00.750
something they want to pursue?

00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:03.890
And I would end by
saying, again as a teacher

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:06.380
at an elite
institution, that it's

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:09.510
my dream come true to get
students who get there not only

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:12.180
because they have tall
aspirations in terms

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:16.790
of external success or money,
but who actually come there

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:18.900
with a hunger to learn.

00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:23.050
So I don't see it as having
really any downside in terms

00:37:23.050 --> 00:37:24.555
of the path to college.

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:29.250
AUDIENCE: So is there
a grading scale?

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:30.740
Do you take tests?

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:34.340
When you apply to colleges, when
they're asking for transcripts,

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:37.180
how do you measure that someone
actually learned something

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:39.639
through the independent project?

00:37:39.639 --> 00:37:41.430
SAMUEL LEVIN: Again,
I'll take a stab at it

00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:42.554
and then see what she says.

00:37:42.554 --> 00:37:47.280
But she'll say the
more interesting thing.

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:52.420
But yeah, I think in
general our approach

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:56.740
is that the design of the system
brings the best out of kids.

00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:58.559
And that the experience--

00:37:58.559 --> 00:38:00.350
I mean, one of the
things that's so amazing

00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:02.170
is that we did awesome things.

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:05.490
We read more books than we had
ever read in our entire life.

00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:07.174
People realized
they loved science.

00:38:07.174 --> 00:38:08.340
All these incredible things.

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:10.220
But even if that
hadn't happened,

00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:13.060
even if things had gone
wrong, the experience

00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:16.812
of being responsible for our
own and each other's education,

00:38:16.812 --> 00:38:18.520
was totally transformative,
and something

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:19.644
we never would have gotten.

00:38:19.644 --> 00:38:22.530
So there are certain elements
of it that can't go wrong.

00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:26.460
I mean, they're
responsible for that.

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:31.180
So that said, it was pass/fail.

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:34.340
They either got the
credits or they didn't.

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:37.314
And yeah, there are
other questions.

00:38:37.314 --> 00:38:38.730
So certainly there
were no grades.

00:38:38.730 --> 00:38:39.620
There were not tests.

00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:41.850
That was not the point.

00:38:41.850 --> 00:38:45.660
And we had constant sort of
measurement and feedback.

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:47.525
So we criticized each
other's on Friday.

00:38:47.525 --> 00:38:51.530
And we had to present
our individual endeavors.

00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:54.300
But nothing like a
sort of point grade.

00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:55.050
SUSAN ENGEL: Yeah.

00:38:55.050 --> 00:38:57.480
I'll say something
about measurement,

00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:59.850
because something I'm
very interested in through

00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:02.240
the whole K-12 spectrum.

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:07.000
We all suffer from this delusion
that the numbers that we're

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.790
used to seeing as measures
of the educational process

00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:10.770
mean something.

00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:12.961
Very few of them mean
anything, except that if you

00:39:12.961 --> 00:39:14.460
get a high score
when you're little,

00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:16.700
you're likely to get a high
score when you're older.

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:19.900
It means itself.

00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:25.620
And so the problem with that
is once you buy into that,

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:28.050
the rest of it seems so fuzzy.

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:31.930
And I will say that I
think a second mistake is

00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:35.160
to think that if you
reject bad measures,

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:36.690
it means you reject
all measures.

00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:39.300
I think we need good
measures of the kinds

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:43.160
of educational outcomes
that Sam found his way to

00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:44.340
in this school.

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:46.757
And there is every reason
to believe we could come up

00:39:46.757 --> 00:39:47.590
with those measures.

00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:49.381
I always say, you know,
I'm a psychologist.

00:39:49.381 --> 00:39:51.360
So we measure all
kinds of things.

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:53.570
We measure unconscious
stereotype, the impulse

00:39:53.570 --> 00:39:56.130
to gamble, love.

00:39:56.130 --> 00:39:58.070
So the idea that
we couldn't measure

00:39:58.070 --> 00:39:59.690
things like your
knowledge of books,

00:39:59.690 --> 00:40:02.560
your real knowledge of books, or
your ability to teach yourself

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:04.760
something new, or
your ability to ask

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:07.510
a good question, which they
spent a lot of time doing,

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:08.020
is silly.

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:09.710
We could measure those things.

00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:13.120
And then maybe we'd offer that
as a different measurement

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:14.310
of what we're doing.

00:40:14.310 --> 00:40:16.860
So I think that
remains to be done,

00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:18.735
and is begging to be done.

00:40:18.735 --> 00:40:19.860
AUDIENCE: My name's George.

00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:20.930
I used to be a teacher.

00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:21.596
SUSAN ENGEL: Hi.

00:40:21.596 --> 00:40:26.170
AUDIENCE: I spent two years
in the city of Chicago.

00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:28.870
A few thoughts, and
then a question.

00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:31.830
One is when I was
teaching in Chicago

00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:34.800
it was an all boys
charter school.

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:40.730
And we were obviously very
obsessed with measurement,

00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:44.630
like all schools,
because that ties

00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:49.050
to how much funding we
get, is the principal going

00:40:49.050 --> 00:40:52.850
to keep his or her job.

00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:58.870
And in a lot of schools they
have a zero tolerance policy

00:40:58.870 --> 00:40:59.720
on discipline.

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:04.670
So it's very strict,
like what you can do,

00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:08.390
what you cannot do in
terms of behavioral,

00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:12.390
which is very different
from what you described.

00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:14.740
The second thing is
what I have seen--

00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:16.920
I moved here from Chicago.

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:20.230
And what I have seen
here in the Bay Area,

00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:24.930
it's very striking, because
I don't know if I want to.

00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:25.440
I'm single.

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:26.189
I don't have kids.

00:41:26.189 --> 00:41:29.270
But I'm not sure
if I do have kids

00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:32.340
I want to raise my
kids here, because kids

00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:38.160
from a very early age they are
already preparing for Stanford

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:38.980
and Berkeley.

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:41.340
And they need to get the scores.

00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:48.370
They are in all these classes,
extracurricular activities,

00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:50.590
trying to have a chance.

00:41:50.590 --> 00:41:54.930
And it's very competitive
here to get into a good school

00:41:54.930 --> 00:41:57.060
in the Bay Area.

00:41:57.060 --> 00:42:01.870
Which is also very different
from what you described.

00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:07.320
So I'm just wondering, obviously
right now, where we are,

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:13.130
we can't use your
system right away.

00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:17.510
But what are some of the
tangible different changes

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:20.330
that we can do right now?

00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:22.570
Maybe have some kind
of hybrid system,

00:42:22.570 --> 00:42:27.100
or any changes we can make
right now to our system?

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:28.820
And one thing I
also want to add is

00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:30.820
I went to the
University of Michigan.

00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:34.205
And one of the best
programs I attended,

00:42:34.205 --> 00:42:38.880
the best educational experience,
was called New England

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:39.810
Literature Program.

00:42:39.810 --> 00:42:44.810
We went into the woods for six
weeks, no electronic device.

00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:47.090
We had to turn in our
cellphone, laptop.

00:42:47.090 --> 00:42:48.560
No heat.

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:49.870
No internet.

00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:56.020
Lived there, read books, poetry,
hiking, go to national parks.

00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:56.800
No shower.

00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:58.270
Jump in to the lake.

00:42:58.270 --> 00:43:01.710
Best educational
experience ever.

00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:05.720
But I know that's also
not realistic for everyone

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:06.651
to do that right away.

00:43:06.651 --> 00:43:07.692
SUSAN ENGEL: And why not?

00:43:07.692 --> 00:43:09.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:11.770
AUDIENCE: Because
Google is probably not

00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:14.940
going to hire people
who jump into the lake.

00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:17.220
They want to see your resume.

00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:21.810
So love to get your thoughts
on what we can do right now.

00:43:21.810 --> 00:43:23.029
Thank you.

00:43:23.029 --> 00:43:25.570
SAMUEL LEVIN: I don't know if
we're on the same page on this.

00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:27.070
So I'll answer.

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:29.990
And it's a pretty simple answer.

00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:34.424
Which is that you said that
you can't, but you should.

00:43:34.424 --> 00:43:35.090
I mean, not you.

00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:37.382
The school's here should.

00:43:37.382 --> 00:43:39.840
Because the point of this was
that I think what we're doing

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:41.294
is wrong.

00:43:41.294 --> 00:43:42.960
I think that most of
conventional school

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:44.700
is making a lot of mistakes.

00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:48.230
And it's not educating
our young well.

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:52.560
And it's wasting their time.

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:55.270
I think that there's
a real danger.

00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:57.660
A lot of times, when we
were first pitching this,

00:43:57.660 --> 00:44:00.671
and since, when we
first pitching it

00:44:00.671 --> 00:44:02.295
people said, well,
that's a great idea.

00:44:02.295 --> 00:44:05.150
But let's just do it for a
period, because they've still

00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:07.280
got to go to their AP class.

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:10.340
Or let's just do
it after school.

00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:13.470
And this is not about tinkering.

00:44:13.470 --> 00:44:15.340
It's about rebuilding.

00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:17.980
And I think we have
to, whatever it takes.

00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:21.320
It certainly won't be easy.

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:24.038
But we have to begin being
ready to make big changes.

00:44:26.757 --> 00:44:28.590
SUSAN ENGEL: So I'm
going to disappoint you.

00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:30.560
We are on the same page.

00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:32.640
I'm going to add one
concrete piece of advice.

00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:34.015
Because as I was
listening to you

00:44:34.015 --> 00:44:36.670
talk about these kids who were
doing all these after school

00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:40.740
things and trying so hard, I was
imagining the kind of question

00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:43.370
that Sam asked the kids around
him when he was designing

00:44:43.370 --> 00:44:44.630
the independent project.

00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:47.670
Which is if you brought a
group of those kids together

00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:52.180
and said, if you could spend
the next period of time learning

00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:55.430
in whatever way you wanted,
or if you could learn whatever

00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:58.600
you wanted, what would it
be, you might be surprised.

00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:01.610
They might choose
to study or embark

00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:04.050
on some pretty
impressive ventures.

00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:06.160
Teenagers are not
without ambition.

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:08.180
It just may be a
different kind of ambition

00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:09.880
than what the adults
right around them

00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:11.150
expect them to have.

00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:13.230
But they have aspirations.

00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:14.730
They have desire.

00:45:14.730 --> 00:45:17.110
They have great interest.

00:45:17.110 --> 00:45:20.820
And so if I were a teacher in
this community, or a parent,

00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:24.570
or had any access to kids,
I'd start very simply.

00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:26.770
I'd get a group of
kids together and say,

00:45:26.770 --> 00:45:30.470
what is it you really want to do
during this period of time that

00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:33.995
will take you forward, that
will be meaningful to you?

00:45:33.995 --> 00:45:36.940
It turns out its' a scarier
question than I ever thought.

00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:40.070
I didn't think it was a big deal
when I said so start your own.

00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:42.020
But I agree with Sam.

00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:45.580
I can't imagine what would stop
people from at least asking

00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:47.010
that question.

00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:49.790
These are supposed to
be student led schools.

00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:52.690
So even if a student doesn't
come up with the idea,

00:45:52.690 --> 00:45:56.750
the role a grownup can play
is to invite the student

00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:57.940
to think in that way.

00:45:57.940 --> 00:45:59.810
And that's just a question.

00:45:59.810 --> 00:46:03.080
AUDIENCE: You alluded to a
little earlier about the role

00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:04.937
that grownups can play,
and how they become

00:46:04.937 --> 00:46:06.020
better mentors, et cetera.

00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:07.600
I was wondering if you could
elaborate a little bit.

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:07.910
SUSAN ENGEL: Yes.

00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:08.701
SAMUEL LEVIN: Yeah.

00:46:08.701 --> 00:46:09.470
Definitely.

00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:16.350
So the idea, the role
I envisioned for adults

00:46:16.350 --> 00:46:18.550
was not being sort
of the lecturer

00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:21.240
at the front of the
room, but actually sort

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:22.880
of being embedded
within the students.

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:25.730
Because certainly
we need teachers

00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:28.960
as sources of expertise,
sources of support,

00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:32.290
developing relationships with
adults so that they can model

00:46:32.290 --> 00:46:36.390
to us what it's like to
both be good intellectually,

00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:40.100
but also as a person,
and as a citizen.

00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:43.520
And that everyone will
benefit from that process

00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:46.120
if they're not sort
of the taskmaster.

00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:48.120
You know, my
girlfriend's a teacher.

00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:49.980
My cousin's a teacher.

00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:54.140
And they spend so much of
their time having to babysit,

00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:55.009
to be taskmasters.

00:46:55.009 --> 00:46:56.300
And it's a waste of their time.

00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:58.720
And it's a waste for the kids.

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:01.910
And so the idea is that they
would be doing the work,

00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:04.380
you know, model what it's
like to ask a good question,

00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:07.080
and pursue the answer, and
teach, to give criticism

00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:11.010
alongside with the students.

00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:11.550
All of that.

00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:17.390
As a coach more than a lecturer
or a sage on the stage.

00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:20.601
In that first year of
the independent project,

00:47:20.601 --> 00:47:23.560
we pitched this idea, and
the school finally said

00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:27.430
OK, but no teacher time.

00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:29.110
And so we didn't get that.

00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:31.200
We had to get a few
teachers to volunteer,

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:34.560
sort of sneak their time
in to spend time with us

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:36.260
when they could.

00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:38.000
Likewise the school
said, OK, fine,

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.550
but you don't get a space.

00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:42.080
So that first year we
were in the coach's office

00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:44.190
of the girls locker room.

00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:46.050
But anyway, that's what we got.

00:47:46.050 --> 00:47:48.430
But what I envisioned
was this new role

00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:51.070
for teachers, which is harder.

00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:51.830
It's harder.

00:47:51.830 --> 00:47:55.090
It's easier to give a
lecture than to learn

00:47:55.090 --> 00:48:01.990
how to lead sort of as the--
To lead from behind basically.

00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:02.740
SUSAN ENGEL: Yeah.

00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:05.790
I mean, I'll just
echo what Sam said,

00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:09.040
that I think that to work
with students in that way

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:13.840
is fascinating, and it's
very difficult to do.

00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:15.370
I am intrigued by the idea.

00:48:15.370 --> 00:48:17.560
So he had this incredible
advisor that year

00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:20.890
who when he came to him with the
idea said something like, OK,

00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:22.340
what can I do to help?

00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:24.260
Taking that seriously
as the beginning

00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:29.880
of your role as a teacher
is a fascinating one.

00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:31.710
What it would take,
I mean, I'm intrigued

00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:33.251
by the question of
what it would take

00:48:33.251 --> 00:48:36.050
to train a group of teachers
to be good at that role.

00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:38.864
And check back with
me in a year or two.

00:48:38.864 --> 00:48:40.280
I'm just thinking
about what would

00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:43.280
that guy say about how he
did it, if he was teaching

00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:44.840
other people to do that.

00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:47.040
So I do think it's hard.

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:49.040
And I can tell you
as a college teacher,

00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:50.640
I know the difference
between the two.

00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:53.132
Sometimes I do one and
sometimes I do the other.

00:48:53.132 --> 00:48:55.090
But I can tell you which
one I love a lot more,

00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:57.460
and which one leads to
a lot better learning

00:48:57.460 --> 00:49:00.350
when I'm leading from behind.

00:49:00.350 --> 00:49:02.690
AUDIENCE: I have a question
from the Dory, which

00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:04.620
you guys kind of
briefly touched upon,

00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:07.840
but I think Emerson wants
a little bit more clarity.

00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:12.700
And it's around students
transitioning into college.

00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:14.740
So I'm assuming even
after maybe admissions,

00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:17.340
and transitioning into college,
where maybe it is still

00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:19.340
a little bit more structured.

00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:21.080
So from your guys'
perspective, how

00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:23.910
do you see your school
in helping a student

00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:28.344
transition into college
and be successful there?

00:49:28.344 --> 00:49:29.510
SAMUEL LEVIN: Good question.

00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:31.320
I've got two parts
to the answer.

00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:33.927
One is that, funnily
enough, that turned out

00:49:33.927 --> 00:49:36.010
in the end-- In the beginning
the big concern when

00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:38.640
I was pitching this idea was
like, whoa, that's crazy.

00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:40.860
Kids will burn the
building down or something.

00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:42.724
But after they
started saying yes,

00:49:42.724 --> 00:49:44.390
and it was like hashing
out the details,

00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:46.600
the biggest concern
became-- Because it was only

00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:48.310
for that fall semester.

00:49:48.310 --> 00:49:51.330
So spring semester they had to
go back into regular classes.

00:49:51.330 --> 00:49:54.889
And everyone became totally
terrified about the transition.

00:49:54.889 --> 00:49:56.722
And they would talk
about it like, you know,

00:49:56.722 --> 00:49:59.430
what about the
transition back into--

00:49:59.430 --> 00:50:02.560
And there are various things
that are funny about that.

00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:06.250
One is, what are
you doing in school

00:50:06.250 --> 00:50:09.420
so that if everyone leaves for
a semester, when they come back

00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:10.900
you think it will be a disaster.

00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:12.608
You know, something's
wrong with a system

00:50:12.608 --> 00:50:16.690
where you can't step away
and come back into it.

00:50:16.690 --> 00:50:20.870
And then also
amazingly, surprisingly,

00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:24.010
when they did have to
transition back in,

00:50:24.010 --> 00:50:25.370
it went really smoothly.

00:50:25.370 --> 00:50:27.570
In fact, everyone
got better grades

00:50:27.570 --> 00:50:29.630
than they had done in
the rest of high school.

00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:31.120
And that wasn't the
point of the program

00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:32.661
was to get them to
get better grades.

00:50:32.661 --> 00:50:33.350
We didn't care.

00:50:33.350 --> 00:50:34.740
None of us cared.

00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:37.620
And despite the fact that
everyone dreaded going back,

00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:40.220
because they dreaded being in
a situation where they weren't

00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:42.149
excited and they weren't
really learning much,

00:50:42.149 --> 00:50:44.690
what they said at least was that
the reason they were getting

00:50:44.690 --> 00:50:46.530
better grades was
because they had learned

00:50:46.530 --> 00:50:48.700
these tools in the
independent project

00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:52.500
to find the bit of the class
that they could pursue and make

00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:55.650
more interesting for
themselves, or to thrive off

00:50:55.650 --> 00:50:57.460
of the more able
kid in the class.

00:50:57.460 --> 00:50:58.290
Things like that.

00:50:58.290 --> 00:50:59.405
Or to teach each other.

00:50:59.405 --> 00:51:01.280
The skills they learned
had made them better.

00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:03.290
And the same is
true for college.

00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:06.600
You know, you're not
going to fall apart

00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:09.094
by having been independent,
or work with other students.

00:51:09.094 --> 00:51:11.260
You're not going to get to
college and then be like,

00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:12.896
I don't know how
to learn anymore.

00:51:12.896 --> 00:51:14.020
In fact, it's the opposite.

00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:16.070
You will learn
skills so that when

00:51:16.070 --> 00:51:17.860
you're a bit more
independent in college

00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:19.334
than you are in
high school, you're

00:51:19.334 --> 00:51:20.500
going to be even better off.

00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:23.740
And then finally, I can
speak from experience.

00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:26.250
I went off to college.

00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:32.760
And I couldn't believe how
often I found myself thinking,

00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:34.240
you know, thank
god I had that time

00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:37.040
in the independent project.

00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:37.630
So yeah.

00:51:37.630 --> 00:51:38.130
That's it.

00:51:38.130 --> 00:51:39.671
SUSAN ENGEL: So I'll
just add to that

00:51:39.671 --> 00:51:42.170
that, again, as a college
professor, the bane

00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:45.680
of our existence, and I speak
here for many of my colleagues,

00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:49.960
is the question, what were
you looking for in this paper?

00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:51.770
Or what did you want?

00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:55.020
What kind of answer did you want
when you asked this question?

00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:56.710
By the time students
get to college

00:51:56.710 --> 00:51:58.450
what we professors
want them to say

00:51:58.450 --> 00:52:00.510
is this is what I
want to write about.

00:52:00.510 --> 00:52:03.060
This is what I want
to learn about.

00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:06.710
And we wish that they were a
little less focused on figuring

00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:09.440
out what the test maker
wanted in the test,

00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:11.820
and a little more
on what do I want

00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:17.200
to get from that book, or that
lecture, or that experience.

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:20.170
So the more that
students can learn

00:52:20.170 --> 00:52:23.560
to be self-directed learners
before they get to us,

00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:25.787
the more fully they can
make use of college.

00:52:25.787 --> 00:52:28.120
AUDIENCE: I have a couple
just like logistical questions

00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:30.450
about where the
project independent is

00:52:30.450 --> 00:52:33.330
today in terms of how many
people are participating.

00:52:33.330 --> 00:52:36.070
Is it still just a fall quarter
during their senior year?

00:52:36.070 --> 00:52:37.370
Or is it a longer program?

00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:40.279
And then also, how
do people-- Do they

00:52:40.279 --> 00:52:41.570
choose to get into the program?

00:52:41.570 --> 00:52:42.520
Do they have to apply?

00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:45.103
If it reaches a certain number,
do you have different cohorts?

00:52:45.103 --> 00:52:47.590
Just kind of how
does it look today?

00:52:47.590 --> 00:52:51.500
SAMUEL LEVIN: The size has
varied from around 8 to 12.

00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:53.940
The element of
being a team, being

00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:56.360
an intellectual
community, is essential.

00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:58.410
And so it needs to be groups.

00:52:58.410 --> 00:53:01.300
It can't be 300 students
mashed together,

00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:03.450
because you get so
much out of having

00:53:03.450 --> 00:53:06.800
a mixed ability, the whole
range of ability students,

00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:09.997
being responsible for
each other's education.

00:53:09.997 --> 00:53:12.330
What I would like is for there
to be 10 of those groups,

00:53:12.330 --> 00:53:15.040
or 50, you know, not one.

00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:18.170
And I'll come back
to that in a second.

00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:21.260
It still only runs
for one semester.

00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:23.880
And, again, I think that
it would benefit so much

00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:25.140
from being a year.

00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:27.500
I mean, one of the things
we had to deal with

00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:30.650
was a sort of
de-orientation period.

00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:34.001
I mean, we got there, and that
first day the bells went off,

00:53:34.001 --> 00:53:36.250
and everyone stood up to
start shuffling their papers.

00:53:36.250 --> 00:53:39.600
And then we were like, wait,
we've got nowhere to go.

00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:42.260
And that just captures so much.

00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:44.110
We had been taught
to be completely

00:53:44.110 --> 00:53:46.120
dependent on teachers.

00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:48.290
And we had to learn how to
be dependent on ourselves

00:53:48.290 --> 00:53:48.914
and each other.

00:53:48.914 --> 00:53:52.350
We had been taught that we
didn't have any interests.

00:53:52.350 --> 00:53:54.270
And so people like
Rix had to discover

00:53:54.270 --> 00:53:55.890
that they could have interests.

00:53:55.890 --> 00:53:57.509
So there was this
long period of--

00:53:57.509 --> 00:53:59.050
and I remember
feeling so frustrated,

00:53:59.050 --> 00:54:02.637
because by the end of
it when people just

00:54:02.637 --> 00:54:03.470
couldn't be stopped.

00:54:03.470 --> 00:54:04.980
They were flying
off of the library,

00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:06.900
and going off to their
individual endeavors.

00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:09.260
I thought, man, imagine
if we had had more time,

00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:11.650
think of what it would be
like at the end of the year.

00:54:11.650 --> 00:54:15.470
Anyway, so I think
it should be a year.

00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:16.970
And I may have
missed a piece of it,

00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:18.610
so let me know if I haven't.

00:54:18.610 --> 00:54:23.480
But I think the
point is there are

00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:24.930
ways in which it should grow.

00:54:24.930 --> 00:54:28.630
And if other people
try it, do it that way.

00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:29.730
Do it for a year.

00:54:29.730 --> 00:54:31.690
Or try it different ways.

00:54:31.690 --> 00:54:34.540
But there is still an
incredible amount of resistance.

00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:36.730
Every summer when I go back
home and visit my family

00:54:36.730 --> 00:54:40.150
I wonder if finally
the ridiculous to think

00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:43.160
people will have sort
of put a stomp on it.

00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:46.280
And there are still parents
whose kids want to do it,

00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:49.100
but are too worried about
them getting into college,

00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:51.350
despite the fact that kids
have gone on to Harvard

00:54:51.350 --> 00:54:53.820
and wherever.

00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:55.828
And anyway, so that's it.

00:54:55.828 --> 00:54:57.220
Yeah.

00:54:57.220 --> 00:54:58.170
Did I miss a--

00:54:58.170 --> 00:54:59.920
AUDIENCE: There is an
application process.

00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:00.380
SAMUEL LEVIN: Oh yeah.

00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:01.100
And finally that.

00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:02.546
Yeah.

00:55:02.546 --> 00:55:04.050
The application process.

00:55:04.050 --> 00:55:06.110
So the idea is it
works for everyone.

00:55:06.110 --> 00:55:08.240
So anyone who wants
to do it can do it.

00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:10.550
The process that we did,
that I came up with,

00:55:10.550 --> 00:55:15.847
but it could be sort of
anything, was three questions.

00:55:15.847 --> 00:55:18.180
If you could spend six months
doing anything you wanted,

00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:20.460
or work on anything you
wanted, what would you do?

00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:22.870
List all of the
uses for a stick.

00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:25.430
And what's a time when you've
worked with other people

00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:26.700
and it hasn't gone well?

00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:29.442
But the point of that was to
let them know the kind of thing

00:55:29.442 --> 00:55:30.400
they were getting into.

00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:31.730
This is going to be different.

00:55:31.730 --> 00:55:34.450
And it's going to be your time.

00:55:34.450 --> 00:55:37.210
Because it's important
that this is for everyone.

00:55:37.210 --> 00:55:38.419
But you got to want to do it.

00:55:38.419 --> 00:55:40.751
If you don't want to do it,
no one's going to force you.

00:55:40.751 --> 00:55:41.620
That would be silly.

00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:42.860
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:43.160
SUSAN ENGEL: Thank you so much.

00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:44.160
SAMUEL LEVIN: Thank you.

00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:46.810
