[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.140
MO FONG: Good
morning, everybody.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.046
How is everyone doing?

00:00:10.046 --> 00:00:10.780
All right.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.390
We're so excited for
all of you to be here.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.120
And thank you, Shenaz, for
sharing your wonderful story

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.060
with us today.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.500
It's really relevant to the
announcement we have for you.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.440
So as you have
heard and you know,

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.820
we are fully committed to
supporting women in tech,

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.550
women who want to be in
tech, and young women who

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.850
are just starting to
dream about being in tech.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.940
So Women Techmakers and
Engineering Education

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.090
at Google, which we
affectionately call Eng Edu--

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.750
we have combined forces,
because we're both passionate

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.130
about providing resources and
computer science education

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.560
to build community
and to increase

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.750
the visibility of role models.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.600
And that's all of you
in this room today.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.090
And hopefully, we can
inspire more young women

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.970
to participate in the field.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.080
So before we actually
know what we can do,

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.090
we had to do a little
bit of research

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.200
to understand why women
and underrepresented groups

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.800
are so fewly represented
in computer science.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.490
So we partnered with Gallup
on a multi-year study

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.100
to understand the root causes.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.120
And today, we are unveiling
a new research brief focused

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.690
on girls to understand
precisely what the issues are

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.120
and what we can do.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.120
So here are some of the
key research findings.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:40.330
What we found is that girls are
1.7 times less likely than boys

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.820
to be encouraged by
parents and teachers

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.100
to go into computer science.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.220
And they are twice as less
likely to see themselves

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.680
on screen and in media.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.220
So it's no wonder
that girls are half as

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.010
confident as boys when it
comes to engaging in computer

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.440
science.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.210
But there's a lot we can do.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.360
And in the research brief, we
highlight some recommendations

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.200
that all of you can help
us participate and do

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.160
to help encourage girls most
about social and cultural

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.930
encouragement.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.940
One of the most important
things we can do

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.130
is to change the narrative.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.640
So we want to see
more diverse images.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.340
And we want to tell stories
of computer scientists

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.040
that are relevant and
that they can relate to.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.080
And so by doing
so, hopefully they

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.020
will be inspired
to change the world

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.050
and maybe even pursue
careers that involve CS.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.770
So to get us
started, we're going

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.810
to be releasing a new resource
tool to do exactly that

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.550
and to share our stories.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.570
So we're announcing three new
careers with code Expeditions

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:49.950
today.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.730
And for those of you who are
not familiar with Google career

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.810
Expeditions and the app and
also with career Expeditions,

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.940
it's basically
virtual field trips.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.170
So as you can imagine, a lot
of field trips are costly,

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.279
or they're logistically
difficult to get to, especially

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:09.570
if you're talking about the
International Space Station

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.820
or Antarctica or Machu Picchu.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.000
And you can actually download
those on Expeditions as well.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.690
But most Expeditions
don't focus on careers.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.520
So what we've done
with this tool

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.430
is to give it a
little bit of a twist.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.650
So with career Expeditions,
we've gone out,

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.200
interviewed
professionals, asked them

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.360
what do they like
about their jobs,

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.640
we shadowed them in
their environments,

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.700
and we learned about how they
got to where they are today

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.670
and how they're incorporating
technology into their field.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.410
So it's kind of like a virtual
career tour, if you will.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.460
And the beauty of
this is that you

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.280
can meet these professionals
wherever they are,

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.550
and you can watch
them wherever you are.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.390
So let's get started, because
we have three inaugural careers

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.820
with code Expeditions featuring
Angelica, Victoria, and Sue.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.720
And they are stellar,
amazing women

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.070
who have used technologies
in so many interesting ways

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.630
in their fields.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.850
You can follow their
stories by downloading

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.730
the Google Expedition's
app into your phone.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.040
And then you can use
a cardboard device

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.940
in order to share their
stories with students using

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.329
the Explorer or the Guide mode.

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.060
So what can you do today?

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.110
You can read about the
research that's in your bags,

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.510
or you can follow the
link on the screen.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.780
Second, you can try
Google Expeditions, again

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.190
downloading the application.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.800
And in your bag, you
have these cardboards,

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.110
so you can check it out today.

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.170
And you can sync your phone
with it and play around with it.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.530
Or you can actually experience
it using a live demo

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.970
that we're going to be hosting
at the reception today.

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.720
And the wonderful thing
about Expeditions,

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.910
too, is that this
is not the end,

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.250
because next week for
Women's History Month

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.290
and also International
Women's Day,

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.110
we're going to be announcing
even more career Expeditions

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.720
for you to take a look at.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.590
And lastly, as Shenaz has also
encouraged all of us to do,

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.764
share your story.

00:05:09.764 --> 00:05:11.430
And you can share it
with someone today.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.830
Share it with a young
person in your life.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.890
And you have an opportunity
to nominate yourself

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.400
and your story to be shared
with a nationwide network

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.980
of students at
CareersWithCode.com/Share.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.000
So thank you so much
for being here today.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.740
I hope you really enjoy today.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.570
And I'll turn it back to Shenaz.

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:31.080
Thank you.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.980
