00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.000
Before we move on to the next stage, which would be dispatch,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.890
let's do a issue quiz. So in this quiz, we have our instruction queue,

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.610
we have our RAT, we have our register file, we have a reservation stations.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.140
These two instructions are already reservation stations.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.320
There are two left to issue. And these are the values of the register file,

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.740
of the RAT, etc. So your task is to issue these two instructions,

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.640
or at least issue those that can be issued at, at this time.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.360
You don't need to consider when these instructions are going to finish,

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.050
just issue whatever can be issued in the next several cycles,

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.170
assuming that these are just not going to leave from here anytime soon
