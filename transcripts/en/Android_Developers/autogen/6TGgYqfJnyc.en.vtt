actionbarcompat well it's a support
 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.480
actionbarcompat well it's a support
library that we released this week as

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490
library that we released this week as
 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.540
library that we released this week as
part of the support library version 18

upwards now actionbarcompat has been
 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.319
upwards now actionbarcompat has been
designed to mimic the action by api

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329
designed to mimic the action by api
 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.060

each of these mirror a theme from themed
at holo and they act accordingly so back

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720
at holo and they act accordingly so back
 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.990
at holo and they act accordingly so back
to our scenario we have in our manifest

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000
to our scenario we have in our manifest
 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.030
to our scenario we have in our manifest
we have an activity which directly uses

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040
we have an activity which directly uses
 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.429
we have an activity which directly uses
the themed holo light dark action bar

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439
the themed holo light dark action bar
 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.469
the themed holo light dark action bar
theme now this comes from the Android

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479
theme now this comes from the Android
 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.530
theme now this comes from the Android
system now to change this fraction bar

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540
system now to change this fraction bar
 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.510
system now to change this fraction bar
compaq we need to use the theme from

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520
compaq we need to use the theme from
 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.609
compaq we need to use the theme from
action bar comma instead so that will be

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619
action bar comma instead so that will be
 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.319
action bar comma instead so that will be
the theme that I can Pat that light dark

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329
the theme that I can Pat that light dark
 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.609
the theme that I can Pat that light dark
action bar female but most applications

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619
action bar female but most applications
 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.319
action bar female but most applications
don't use this and they don't use themes

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329
don't use this and they don't use themes
 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.569
don't use this and they don't use themes
directly they have customized themes so

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579
directly they have customized themes so
 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.010
directly they have customized themes so
here we have a small example with a

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020
here we have a small example with a
 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.230
here we have a small example with a
theme called themed off styled which has

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240
theme called themed off styled which has
 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.120
theme called themed off styled which has
a parent of themed at holida light which

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130
a parent of themed at holida light which
 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.180
a parent of themed at holida light which
has a custom action bar theme and that

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190
has a custom action bar theme and that
 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.010
has a custom action bar theme and that
that that style it is referenced below

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020
that that style it is referenced below
 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.589
that that style it is referenced below
now for actionbarcompat we've had to

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599
now for actionbarcompat we've had to
 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.610
now for actionbarcompat we've had to
import a lot of active

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620
import a lot of active
 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.110
import a lot of active
it's interaction my compact which you're

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120
it's interaction my compact which you're
 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.720
it's interaction my compact which you're
after then use so there are two rules

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730
after then use so there are two rules
 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.149
after then use so there are two rules
you need to think about the first is

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159
you need to think about the first is
 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:21.979
you need to think about the first is
that your style must always have an app

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989
that your style must always have an app
 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.039
that your style must always have an app
compat apparent and secondly you must

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049
compat apparent and secondly you must
 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.380
compat apparent and secondly you must
always double set each attribute once in

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390
always double set each attribute once in
 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.570
always double set each attribute once in
the android namespace then again in the

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580
the android namespace then again in the
 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.899
the android namespace then again in the
default namespace so back to our

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909
default namespace so back to our
 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:35.330
default namespace so back to our
scenario theme that star would become

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340
scenario theme that star would become
 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.059
scenario theme that star would become
this so rule number one has to have an

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069
this so rule number one has to have an
 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.130
this so rule number one has to have an
app compat the parent so here we've

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140
app compat the parent so here we've
 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.839
app compat the parent so here we've
changed it to a theme but I can Pat the

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849
changed it to a theme but I can Pat the
 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.270
changed it to a theme but I can Pat the
light and then rule number two you have

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280
light and then rule number two you have
 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.380
light and then rule number two you have
to double set each attribute

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390
to double set each attribute
 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.330
to double set each attribute
now the we've already set it in the

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340
now the we've already set it in the
 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.670
now the we've already set it in the
Enver namespace as we need as you can

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680
Enver namespace as we need as you can
 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.759
Enver namespace as we need as you can
see so we need to copy that value and do

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769
see so we need to copy that value and do
 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.259
see so we need to copy that value and do
it again in the default namespace which

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269
it again in the default namespace which
 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.720
it again in the default namespace which
is the second bit in green so that's it

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730
is the second bit in green so that's it
 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.009
is the second bit in green so that's it
we styles as long as you follow those

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019
we styles as long as you follow those
 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.339
we styles as long as you follow those
rules you should be fine so following on

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349
rules you should be fine so following on
 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.440
rules you should be fine so following on
with that with menus so as with the

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450
with that with menus so as with the
 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.509
with that with menus so as with the
standard action bar items are added to

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519
standard action bar items are added to
 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.399
standard action bar items are added to
it they're the options menu now we

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409
it they're the options menu now we
 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:09.349
it they're the options menu now we
recommend you add and we have their menu

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359
recommend you add and we have their menu
 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.630
recommend you add and we have their menu
resources so here is an example menu

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640
resources so here is an example menu
 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.800
resources so here is an example menu
resource with one item a search item and

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810
resource with one item a search item and
 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.960
resource with one item a search item and
that item has an action view plus a

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970
that item has an action view plus a
 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.080
that item has an action view plus a
reference in a search for you now the

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090
reference in a search for you now the
 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.879
reference in a search for you now the
curve of this is that it has two

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889
curve of this is that it has two
 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:24.289
curve of this is that it has two
attributes which were added in honeycomb

fragment activity itself that means you

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709
fragment activity itself that means you
 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.470
fragment activity itself that means you
can continue using fragments but you

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480
can continue using fragments but you
 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.640
can continue using fragments but you
must use the support implementation and

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650
must use the support implementation and
 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.229
