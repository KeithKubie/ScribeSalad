00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.470
PROFESSOR: There's a reading.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.570
The new reading is on Stellar.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.180
It's an excerpt from a textbook
on dynamics by Professor Jim

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.140
Williams who was in the
mechanical engineering

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.030
department here at MIT
and just recently retired.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.610
This reading is essentially
a review of everything

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.700
we've done in kinematics.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.700
So it gives you a
different point of view.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.570
It's extremely well written.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.990
So it goes through
things like derivatives

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.610
of rotating vectors.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.440
It has three or four really
terrific examples of problems

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.430
that are solved using the
techniques that we've used up

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.710
to this point.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.590
So it's a good way to
review for the quiz, which

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.890
is coming up a week from
Thursday, on October 14.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.980
That quiz will be here,
closed book, one sheet

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.070
of notes, piece of paper
both sides as your reference

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.740
material.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.480
OK, survey results.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.420
So you have p set four.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.690
It has I think five
questions on that.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.910
We'll quickly take a
look at the problems

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.780
that you're working
on right now.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.800
So here's this yo-yo
like thing, a spool.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.550
There were some questions on nb.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.155
The inner piece doesn't rotate
relative to the out piece.

00:01:47.155 --> 00:01:53.230
It's all one solid spool, but
it has two different radii that

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.230
are functioning in the problem.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.760
And the question is, will
the spool roll to the left

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.324
or to the right when the
string is pulled to the right?

00:02:01.324 --> 00:02:02.740
So we're going to
come back to it.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.073
I'm just going to run through
all the questions quickly.

00:02:05.073 --> 00:02:07.830
The second one was this
somewhat familiar problem

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.850
you've done now.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.090
The question asks
you about how fast

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.450
it has to go before the
thing starts sliding up.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.210
And the survey question, if the
starting position of the spool

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.460
is moved down the rod,
will the angular rate

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.650
be higher when spool
begins to slide up the rod?

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.820
Will you have to go
faster to get it to go?

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.400
OK, next.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.452
OK, this is finding the equation
of motion for a pendulum.

00:02:41.452 --> 00:02:43.160
And everybody knows
the natural frequency

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.826
of a pendulum's square
root of g over l.

00:02:44.826 --> 00:02:47.635
But this pendulum has a
torsional spring added to it.

00:02:47.635 --> 00:02:50.570
And the question is, the
square root of g over l

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.080
doesn't involve the mass.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.660
But will the natural
frequency, now

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.160
that you've put the torsional
spring on it, will it now

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.489
involve the mass?

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:00.780
No reason you should know this.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.950
You've never done
this problem before.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.821
And we'll come back to that.

00:03:04.821 --> 00:03:05.320
Next.

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:08.600
The fourth problem.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.460
Two degree of freedom system.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.670
And wants you to come up
with the equation of motion.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.520
But the survey question,
if k1 didn't exist,

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.150
this is just two masses
coupled by spring,

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.060
this thing is no longer
constrained in the x direction.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.450
There's no x constraints
on the system.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.950
So if that's the case,
this system still

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.510
has two natural frequencies.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.100
A system that can
vibrant essentially

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.860
has as many natural frequencies
as it does equations of motion.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.760
This one requires two
equations of motion,

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.050
but it will have one 0 natural
frequency and the other one

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.740
greater than 0.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.920
In the second case when
it's greater than 0,

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.750
this thing is
oscillating somehow.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:58.990
It has no extra strength.

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.460
What can you say about the
position of the center of mass?

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.490
So click at the results.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.010
So this is the first one
is the spool problem.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.180
There's the spool.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.940
Here's table.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.410
Here's the inner radius.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.760
It's got a string wrapped on it.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.200
You're pulling the string this
way at v in the i direction.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:35.120
This'll be o xy.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.600
And now the question is,
when you pull on this,

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.330
which way will the spool go?

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.230
And most of you said
it will go to the left.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:44.866
So I made this up.

00:04:44.866 --> 00:04:46.240
We're going to do
the experiment.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.640
So I've wrapped Teflon
tape on this spool.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.210
It's got a C battery
in the center

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.730
to give it a little
bit of weight.

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:09.750
And here's the experiment.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.390
And the guys in the booth
I hope have in a minute

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.535
to zoom in on it.

00:05:15.535 --> 00:05:17.660
I'm going to let go and
I'm going to start pulling.

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:18.710
Oops.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.690
I need to put a
little more out here.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:22.500
Pull on the tape.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.630
You believe it?

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.640
So I've done the reverse
of what's in there.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:32.550
I'm pulling that way.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.680
But it goes in the same
direction as you pull it.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.760
So the answer to this question
is, it would go to the right.

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.848
Kind of unbelievable
almost, right?

00:05:44.848 --> 00:05:47.276
How does it do that?

00:05:47.276 --> 00:05:48.025
Let's do it again.

00:05:57.164 --> 00:05:58.650
All right.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.240
Now, show you something else.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.580
If that hasn't
boggled your mind.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:11.110
Then what's it going to
do if I pull straight up?

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.310
How many think it's
going to go that way?

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.130
Raise your hand.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.390
How many think it's
going to go that way?

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:19.890
Raise your hand.

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:22.330
All right.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:23.360
Sure enough.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.800
That means it must be some
angle between in which

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.630
it will do neither.

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:28.910
It'll start to slip.

00:06:35.152 --> 00:06:36.144
Right about there.

00:06:42.697 --> 00:06:43.530
Neat little problem.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:54.270
And now doing this problem is
all about computing velocities,

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.365
using concepts like.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:05.660
So if we call this a, b, c.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.240
I think it's the other
way around in the problem.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.610
Excuse me.

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:14.090
A, b, c, and d.

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.810
The key to this problem is
being able to figure out

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:29.990
what the velocity
of this point c is.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.660
And the first thing
to understand,

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:40.120
this is the velocity of the
end of the tape in a fixed

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.622
reference frame.

00:07:41.622 --> 00:07:45.070
So every point on the tape
moves at the same speed.

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:47.010
That means where it
touches right here

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:49.810
is also moving at that speed.

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:58.455
So the velocity of c with
respect to o is to vi.

00:07:58.455 --> 00:08:00.925
And that's kind of the
key to the problem.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:10.810
That's also equal to the
velocity of d with respect

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:16.538
to o plus the velocity
of c with respect to d.

00:08:16.538 --> 00:08:21.870
And the velocity
of d is this point

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:23.700
of contact with the ground.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.090
What's that velocity?

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:26.680
0.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.900
This is back to those
instantaneous center

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.430
of rotation things.

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:33.820
0 there is what makes
this equation easy.

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:39.430
And then you know how to compute
the velocity of a rotating

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:39.929
vector.

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:42.309
This one's not changing
length, but it is surely

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:44.290
rotating about
this point, and so

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:47.234
there's going to be
an omega cross r here.

00:08:47.234 --> 00:08:48.900
And that'll allow you
to solve for omega

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.810
and then once you know
for omega then you

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:55.510
can solve for a, which is the
real question that was asked.

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:57.410
OK.

00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:58.010
Next one.

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:07.235
So the starting position,
this is a spool.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.140
There's the arm.

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:19.830
And here, the question is
at 0.25 meters up here.

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:26.840
And if you move it
down to 0.15 will

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:30.730
the system be able to go faster
before it breaks loose or not?

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:33.190
And your answer was
most people said yes.

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:36.120
And basically that's true.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.260
What is it that's
driving that thing,

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:43.660
providing the force
that is trying

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:44.950
to push it up the sleeve?

00:09:48.534 --> 00:09:49.450
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:55.110
PROFESSOR: So the rod
as it's going around

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.280
is trying to drive
that thing in a circle.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:02.930
And therefore, it
is being accelerated

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:04.020
to the central points.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.430
So it has centripetal
acceleration.

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:11.750
And that requires forces and
they come through the rod.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:15.440
And that will develop the
normal forces and friction.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:22.160
So when you slide down the
rod some to that new position,

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.870
is has that centripetal
acceleration gone up or down.

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:29.690
r's gotten smaller.

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:33.080
Centripetal acceleration is?

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.520
r omega squared, right?

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.510
So you might be
speaking algebraically.

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:41.900
So the magnitude of that
centripetal acceleration

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:46.700
has gone up or down if you
bring it closer to the axis.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:47.490
Down.

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:51.450
So you can go faster to
get up to the same level

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.341
of acceleration or
it'll break free.

00:10:53.341 --> 00:10:53.840
Next.

00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:00.820
This is, oh, the natural
frequency of the pendulum.

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:03.479
Some of you said yes, some of
you said no, some not sure.

00:11:03.479 --> 00:11:04.520
You're going to find out.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.561
You're going to figure
out the equation of motion

00:11:06.561 --> 00:11:07.240
of the system.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:10.565
And it includes that torsional
spring and mass is definitely

00:11:10.565 --> 00:11:11.620
going to be in it.

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:15.242
So look for an answer
that includes--

00:11:15.242 --> 00:11:19.100
that you'll see that mass
is going to show up in a way

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:23.260
that if you solve for
the natural frequency,

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.421
it won't leave the
final equation.

00:11:25.421 --> 00:11:25.920
OK.

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:40.240
So this is the one
about the two masses.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:44.780
And if the spring were 0,
the second natural frequency

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:46.030
of the system.

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:47.410
The first natural
frequency, when

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:48.784
you have a system
that has what's

00:11:48.784 --> 00:11:52.130
called a rigid body
degree of freedom.

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:55.200
When this thing went,
there's no k1 spring.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:12:01.070
This system looks like two
masses on wheels connected

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:02.770
by a spring and a dashpot.

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:10.715
And in the x direction,
there are no constraints.

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:16.232
So if I set this
system to vibrating,

00:12:16.232 --> 00:12:18.565
what can you say about the
motion of its center of mass?

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:29.896
So could you find the center
of mass of that system?

00:12:29.896 --> 00:12:31.270
Got to give you
the masses of it.

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:36.810
But you have some m1 and an m2.

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:45.150
And we'll call this the
x in that direction.

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:47.910
Could you determine the
center of mass of the system?

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:49.700
You know how to do that, right?

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:52.050
If they were equal in mass,
it'd be in the center.

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:55.950
If this was bigger, it'd be over
here or something like that.

00:12:55.950 --> 00:13:00.380
So we know that for a
system of particles,

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:02.910
the sum of the external
forces on the system

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:06.210
is equal to mass of the
system times the acceleration

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:10.020
of the what?

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.256
Center of mass.

00:13:12.256 --> 00:13:14.630
What are the external forces
in the horizontal direction?

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.110
How big are they?

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:19.920
0.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.580
Therefore, what can
be the acceleration

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:23.140
of the center of mass?

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:23.830
0.

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:26.877
This thing will actually in
this second natural frequency,

00:13:26.877 --> 00:13:28.960
it'll sit there and just
oscillate back and forth,

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.970
one mask on one directional,
one on the other.

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:34.610
But its center of
mass won't move.

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:38.000
The other degree of freedom and
the other natural frequency,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.060
the one that has 0
natural frequency,

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:41.340
is a rigid body motion.

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:42.770
No relative motion.

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:44.980
Give this thing a little
push, some initial momentum,

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:46.472
it'll just sit
their role forever.

00:13:46.472 --> 00:13:48.430
The mass is not moving
relative to one another.

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:50.475
It just rolls and rolls
and rolls and rolls

00:13:50.475 --> 00:13:51.730
and never comes back.

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:55.049
Infinite period 0
natural frequency.

00:13:55.049 --> 00:13:56.840
OK, we were talking
about fictitious forces

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:57.760
the other day.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:04.020
And there are times
when they're useful.

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:09.930
But they're sort of like giving
a little kid a loaded gun.

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:13.100
You really get yourself
in trouble quickly.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:16.530
So I'm not advocating
a lot of use of it.

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:18.520
But it's good to have
a little insight.

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.590
One of the students after
the lecture last time,

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:23.950
a student mentioned
to me, he said,

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:29.150
the way I was taught
about fictitious forces

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:33.030
is that we use them to
patch up a problem when

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:36.560
we're trying to work in
a non inertial frame.

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:40.490
How can you make Newton's
laws apply if you

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:43.650
are in a non inertial frame?

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:46.230
Otherwise an accelerating
reference frame.

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:48.720
So I just thought I would
revisit a little bit of what

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:54.110
we said the other day with
explaining things that way

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:55.130
a little bit.

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:58.610
So it might just turn out
to be familiar for you.

00:14:58.610 --> 00:14:59.940
And let's just look.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:12.760
Let's just go back quickly and
revisit that elevator problem.

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.570
So you remember you're here.

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:17.575
You've got some mass m.

00:15:17.575 --> 00:15:20.260
You're standing on some scales.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.649
And I want to know what the
scales are going to read.

00:15:22.649 --> 00:15:24.440
Now, we did this one
quickly the other day.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.648
I'm just going to revisit it.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:32.710
And this accelerating,
this is point A.

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:35.235
And here down here is o.

00:15:35.235 --> 00:15:36.325
My inertial frame.

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:43.040
And the acceleration
of A with respect to o

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:50.546
is plus a quarter of g
in the j hat direction.

00:15:50.546 --> 00:15:52.980
OK?

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:56.420
Now, when you think
about this, if you're

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:59.200
trying to do physics
in the elevator,

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.880
but it's an accelerating frame,
so Newton's laws don't apply.

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:05.780
So you're in the elevator.

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:08.600
You can't see
you're accelerating.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.700
But you could measure
your weight, for example.

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:18.730
So how do you fix
up the equations

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:22.750
so that you can predict
the right answer?

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:28.570
And to do that, basically
you I have to add in a force,

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:31.720
a fictitious force,
that accounts

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:35.870
for the additional
forces you will

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:40.046
feel in this system due
to the acceleration.

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:47.190
So remember the way
we did this problem.

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:49.470
You do this problem just
in a straightforward

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:56.670
way, a summation of the external
forces in the y direction

00:16:56.670 --> 00:17:02.800
is the mass times acceleration,
a with respect to o.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.200
And we need a free body diagram.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:12.119
In the free body
diagrams, this mass here,

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:18.720
you have an mg downwards
and an n upwards.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:27.470
And so you'd say this
is equal to n minus mg.

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:33.740
Now, if you're doing
this experiment inside,

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:37.080
you can measure this n that's
going to be your weight.

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:40.010
And you would like to do
this by fictitious forces,

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:52.560
you say that the summation
of the external real forces

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:58.150
minus this mass times the
acceleration of a with respect

00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:04.470
to o has got to be equal to 0.

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:13.940
And that's then n minus
mg minus mg over 4.

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:15.265
Here's your fictitious force.

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:22.610
And that's as if then
you've come over here

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:29.800
and you've added an additional
force on this free body diagram

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:34.270
that looks like mg over 4.

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:38.990
And now you say the sum of these
forces, this is the correction.

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:44.000
It's allowing you now to work
in this accelerating frame.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.260
If do this free body
diagram and sum these up,

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:53.220
then you will find
this expression,

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:55.500
which you can solve for n.

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:59.730
And you'll get m5 over 4g.

00:19:02.167 --> 00:19:04.625
In fact, if you stood on the
scales, that's what you'd get.

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.630
All right, so this
is example one.

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:19.730
I want to do sort
of example 1.5.

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:23.735
The cable breaks
on this elevator.

00:19:44.038 --> 00:19:49.070
Your free body diagram
still has an mg on it.

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:51.110
You're still inside.

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:53.720
You're still measuring forces.

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.110
And you want to use this
idea of a fictitious force

00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:58.970
to help you sort out
what forces will you

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:00.570
feel inside of that elevator.

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:12.330
You know how to do the answer
in this straightforward way.

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:19.390
The sum of external
forces is minus mg.

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:22.630
And that's equal to the
mass times the acceleration

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:24.680
of a with respect to o.

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:29.545
And therefore acceleration
of a with respect to o

00:20:29.545 --> 00:20:31.410
is just minus g.

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:39.080
And you could have told me that.

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:39.704
That's trivial.

00:20:39.704 --> 00:20:42.550
If you drop the thing, it
accelerates the acceleration

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:43.460
of gravity.

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:46.820
So I want to know
what's the-- you're

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:48.220
doing the experiment inside.

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.920
You don't know that
you're accelerating.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:51.720
All you're doing
is measurements.

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:54.510
But you've been told
how to correct it.

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:58.270
So let's put it in the
fictitious force, which

00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:01.310
is minus ma 0.

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:11.820
And that means the mass times
acceleration is downwards.

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:13.890
So minus that.

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:18.180
The fictitious force
is an mg force upwards.

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:19.090
And what do you feel?

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.670
What do the scales read?

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:25.550
Nothing.

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:26.985
You feel absolutely nothing.

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.440
OK.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:38.340
So just an aside kind of
question, because I know this

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:39.800
is confused.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:41.830
Occasionally we all get
confused around this.

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:49.823
In these problems that we do,
is gravity an acceleration?

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.670
We say all the time,
I use the phrase

00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:00.006
the acceleration of gravity.

00:22:00.006 --> 00:22:01.630
How many times have
you ever said that?

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:03.254
Have you ever said that?

00:22:03.254 --> 00:22:04.420
The acceleration of gravity.

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:05.350
What do we mean?

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:06.332
What we mean is this.

00:22:06.332 --> 00:22:08.040
When you let something
drop in free fall,

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:09.950
it'll accelerate at g.

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:13.630
But the way we apply when
we're writing out equations

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:16.940
of motion, we say the sum
of the external forces

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:18.480
is equal to mass
times acceleration.

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.311
Where does gravity go?

00:22:20.311 --> 00:22:23.250
It's a force.

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:25.730
So this is another
thing not to get

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:30.800
confused by is to think
about gravity as being

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:31.570
an acceleration.

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:33.410
We spend a lot of
time figuring out ways

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:36.680
to write accelerations
in rotating,

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.200
translating, reference frames.

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.780
Gravity never pops up in there.

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:43.760
It always comes up on the
force side of the equation.

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:44.260
OK.

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:56.130
All right, so one last
example from last time.

00:22:56.130 --> 00:23:00.610
But it's relevant to a
problem on the homework.

00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:04.530
So we have this shaft spinning.

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:08.830
This is the z-axis spinning
at constant rate omega.

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:20.740
And we'll use this is r
hat and this is z k hat.

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:25.340
These are the lengths r hat
direction and the height z.

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:27.580
We're using cylindrical
coordinates.

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:32.600
And now let's just use this
notion of fictitious forces

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:36.910
to figure out first
what's the what's

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:38.610
the fictitious force
in this system.

00:23:42.819 --> 00:23:44.610
Remember, this is now
this notion of you're

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:46.920
out there where this mass is.

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:48.620
You're riding with this mass.

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:52.407
And you're trying to say,
what force am I going to feel?

00:23:52.407 --> 00:23:54.240
You want to be able to
predict it correctly.

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:57.370
So you have to find
a fictitious force

00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:01.380
that you can bring in
that accounts for what

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:06.000
acceleration are we
feeling out there.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.020
Centripetal, right?

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:10.910
And the centripetal
acceleration,

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:14.750
we want the sum of
the external forces.

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:17.951
And this is going
to be in the r hat

00:24:17.951 --> 00:24:27.530
direction minus m
times the-- and now we

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:29.090
need reference frames here.

00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:35.240
So you have a fixed frame o xy.

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:40.470
You have a rotating frame here,
a x prime, y prime, z prime.

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:44.470
And this is your
point b up here.

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:51.030
So some of the external
forces minus the mass

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:55.410
times the acceleration
of b with respect to 0

00:24:55.410 --> 00:25:00.990
has got to be equal to 0.

00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:04.160
That's how this fictitious
force thing works.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:08.480
So on the free body
diagram of this thing,

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.220
what are the actual
forces on it?

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:17.090
Well, there's certainly
a weight downwards.

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:20.770
There must be some
supporting force upwards.

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:24.130
And we'll put that in
the z direction here.

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:26.670
Because this thing certainly
doesn't accelerate up and down.

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:29.110
So the rods lifting
it up somehow.

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:35.820
The rod has potentially
some radial component.

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:38.270
And I'm just drawing it
in the positive direction.

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:41.470
And those are my forces.

00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:46.510
And in this problem,
omega dot theta double dot

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:51.660
equals 0 and r dot and
r double dot were 0.

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:53.960
So it's constant rotation rate.

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.790
No geometry changes here.

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:01.910
So we did, we cranked
through this problem before.

00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:04.270
And now I wanted to
make this correction.

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:07.060
I want to add this
fictitious force in.

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:11.430
The acceleration
is minus r omega

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:13.330
squared in the r hat direction.

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:17.290
So minus m times that is a plus.

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:24.120
I get an m r omega squared.

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:32.650
And pointing outwards.

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:41.210
And so the sum of the forces
in the radial direction

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:47.470
minus-- some of the forces
in the radial direction now

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:52.270
minus this mab
with respect to o.

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:54.270
Well, what are some
of the real forces?

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:56.970
Just nr.

00:26:56.970 --> 00:27:01.414
And this minus mass times the
acceleration, that's your mr

00:27:01.414 --> 00:27:01.913
squared.

00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:06.840
mr omega squared.

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:09.360
And that's got to be 0.

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:12.035
So you find out
that there is a--

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.490
This all is 0.

00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:35.370
Therefore solve for nr is
minus mr omega squared.

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:41.280
So that rod out here is
constantly pulling it in

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:43.510
to make it go around the circle.

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:45.660
But we've just done
this now by this notion

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:48.650
of a fictitious force.

00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:52.640
So let's go back to
this problem now.

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:55.910
Well actually, I'll just
take one final step.

00:27:55.910 --> 00:28:01.630
Here's your free body
diagram touched up

00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:03.720
with this fictitious
force so that we

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:06.760
can work as if we're here.

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:09.937
And by the way, if
you could measure,

00:28:09.937 --> 00:28:11.520
if you had a strain
gauge or something

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:17.810
so you can measure the
force that this rod

00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:19.800
is putting on that mass.

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.347
If you can measure
it out there, this

00:28:21.347 --> 00:28:22.680
would be what you would measure.

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:35.990
Now what about the torque that
force creates around here?

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:43.330
So you have outward
force mr omega

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:48.830
squared at centrifugal
force, this fictitious force.

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:52.110
Going pulling it out up here.

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:53.880
What moment does that
create down here?

00:28:57.870 --> 00:28:59.135
What's the magnitude first?

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:11.380
And that'll be a torque
around in the theta direction.

00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:18.164
So what's the moment arm?

00:29:18.164 --> 00:29:20.060
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:23.200
PROFESSOR: The moment arm?

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:24.870
The moment arm.

00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:25.580
z.

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:26.360
OK.

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:30.110
So then the torque is
going to be 4r cross f

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:38.440
and it's going to be
the mrz omega squared.

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:44.360
And it's at centripetal
forces trying to bend it out.

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:46.660
Therefore the torque
down here required

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:50.000
to keep it from
doing so is actually

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.230
in the other direction.

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:59.640
So the torque that this system
must put on this bar is minus.

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:01.320
OK.

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:03.630
So let's go to this problem.

00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:07.260
If this is the point about which
we're computing the moments,

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:11.980
then there's centripetal
acceleration in this problem,

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:13.361
but in what direction are they?

00:30:16.105 --> 00:30:17.230
Either one of those masses.

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:24.980
Pardon?

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:28.150
So each little mass, like
the upper mass m over 2.

00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:31.190
It's spinning and it's shown as
it's coming around the wheel.

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:32.850
It's up at the top.

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:36.505
What direction is
the fictitious force

00:30:36.505 --> 00:30:39.350
that it's putting
on that system?

00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:41.340
Radial outwards, right?

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:43.600
And does it have
any moment arm that

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:46.800
force going up with respect
to that point in the center?

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:47.300
No.

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:48.540
So it creates no moment.

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:51.550
The bottom one by
symmetry doesn't either.

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:58.100
This one over here, it
also has a fictitious force

00:30:58.100 --> 00:30:58.820
you can think of.

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:01.200
It's just outward
mr omega squared.

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:05.951
What's its moment arm with
respect to our origin here?

00:31:05.951 --> 00:31:06.450
0.

00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:08.010
Again, it produces no moment.

00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:10.810
It produces an unbalanced
force though, right?

00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:13.520
It's going around producing
an unbalanced force.

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:17.340
This problem, the upper ones,
the fictitious force is up.

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:19.621
The lower one, which
direction is it?

00:31:19.621 --> 00:31:20.120
Down.

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:22.170
It's perfectly balanced.

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:25.896
They're just equal and
opposite, just going around.

00:31:25.896 --> 00:31:27.270
You'd feel nothing
uncomfortable.

00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:29.603
This one you'd feel, this
motorcycle trying to hop down.

00:31:32.135 --> 00:31:34.000
It really happens, right?

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.180
But this one, what happens?

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:39.980
Does this mass m over
2, what direction is

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:42.720
the centripetal acceleration?

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.450
I've changed the
wording a little bit.

00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:47.450
The upper mass in case
b, which direction

00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:50.920
is the centripetal acceleration?

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:52.290
Straight down, right?

00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:54.290
And the bottom mass,
what direction?

00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:55.330
Straight up.

00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:59.930
And the fictitious
forces that reflect

00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:03.555
those two accelerations
are the top one is up

00:32:03.555 --> 00:32:05.620
and the bottom one is down.

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:08.660
But they produce a net.

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:11.360
Do they have a moment arm
that they act on with respect

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:12.647
to that center?

00:32:12.647 --> 00:32:13.980
Yeah, this little distance here.

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:16.120
I think it's called
b in the problem.

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:20.240
So this thing, m over 2
r omega squared times b,

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.780
is a torque about the x-axis.

00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:25.100
And this one down
here is another m

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:28.150
over 2 r omega squared
and it's another torque

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:29.110
in the same direction.

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:33.410
So this thing produces
quite a strong moment.

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:43.100
But as the wheel turns,
that moment starts off,

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:45.630
it's about the x-axis here.

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:47.680
But when that weight
gets to 90 degrees,

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.000
what direction is the moment?

00:32:51.730 --> 00:32:57.600
So we just do all the
way around the y-axis.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:58.810
So it's going to be a moment.

00:32:58.810 --> 00:33:00.860
The answer to this
problem is in time

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:05.650
it's going to look something
like mr omega squared z

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:08.270
sine or cosine omega t.

00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:10.700
So the moment in this
around the x-axis

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:13.900
is going to be trying to--
the bike's going to try

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:17.300
to go back and forth like this.

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:18.801
With frequency omega.

00:33:18.801 --> 00:33:19.300
OK.

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.209
Oh, I was going to say that's
it for fictitious forces,

00:33:29.209 --> 00:33:29.750
but it's not.

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:31.270
I've got a great demo for you.

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:41.130
All right.

00:33:49.986 --> 00:33:50.820
We have a slope.

00:33:55.820 --> 00:34:00.310
I've got a cart on wheels there.

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:01.110
And I actually do.

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:06.000
OK.

00:34:10.737 --> 00:34:14.999
And I'm going to put a box here.

00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:20.230
I got the wrong
color here, but I'll

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:22.239
try colored chalk
for the first time.

00:34:22.239 --> 00:34:23.520
In the box I've got a fluid.

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:30.580
And the box has a lid on
it so I don't make a mess.

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:38.360
Now, I'm actually going
to do this experiment.

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:39.639
I brought my ramp.

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:41.810
We're going to set up this ramp.

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:44.929
This box is going to be
rolling down this hill.

00:34:44.929 --> 00:34:48.110
And basically no losses.

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:49.898
No friction holding it back.

00:34:49.898 --> 00:34:52.314
It's just going to be able to
take off and accelerate down

00:34:52.314 --> 00:34:52.920
that hill.

00:34:56.219 --> 00:35:03.980
I want to know a, b, c.

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:14.050
When it's rolling down that
hill, will the fluid in the box

00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:30.370
look like that, look
like that, or like that?

00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:41.010
So we're going to
take our poll here.

00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:47.690
So how many believe that when
it's rolling down the hill,

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:50.730
the fluid will stay level,
parallel to the ground?

00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:52.120
Let's raise your hands.

00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:54.007
I want everybody to
make a guess here.

00:35:54.007 --> 00:35:54.840
Everybody get in it.

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:58.750
Raise them high if you think
it's going to stay level.

00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:00.520
OK, maybe a quarter of you.

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:02.912
How many think it's
going to do this?

00:36:02.912 --> 00:36:05.290
OK, a few more.

00:36:05.290 --> 00:36:08.100
And how many think
it's going to do this?

00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:12.500
All right, so I want you get
in natural little groups there

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:15.610
of two or three people and talk
about this for a couple minutes

00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:18.750
and see if you can convince
your neighbor that you're right.

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:19.950
Figure this out.

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:20.960
Stop and talk about it.

00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:26.900
And let's set up to
do the experiment.

00:36:33.023 --> 00:36:36.914
Actually, I think
if we do it up here.

00:36:36.914 --> 00:36:38.320
Yeah.

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.630
So like that.

00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:44.805
So you hold the ramp.

00:36:44.805 --> 00:36:46.186
OK, you come here.

00:36:49.850 --> 00:36:53.030
We'll just practice our
set up here for a second.

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:56.730
You're going to have to
hold it quite a bit higher.

00:36:56.730 --> 00:36:59.044
And actually when
we get ready to go--

00:36:59.044 --> 00:37:00.460
AUDIENCE: How well
sealed is that?

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:03.240
PROFESSOR: It's
very well sealed.

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.231
You hold it and you release it.

00:37:05.231 --> 00:37:07.730
And that's about the right--
because I got to catch it so it

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:10.241
doesn't-- now,
we're going to stop.

00:37:10.241 --> 00:37:11.740
We're not going to
do it right away.

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:15.340
I'm going to get them to answer
the question a second time.

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:21.845
Good idea.

00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:28.015
All right.

00:37:28.015 --> 00:37:30.610
And I think that'll
work just great.

00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:33.230
And we're not going
to give it away.

00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:36.730
OK, so set it down and
we'll do the thing.

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:37.870
Just drop it.

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:59.010
OK, let's do the quiz again.

00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:01.430
I want to see if any of
you convinced your neighbor

00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:03.305
to change their vote.

00:38:03.305 --> 00:38:07.970
So how many believe
that it's going to be A?

00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:10.190
Hm, one or two.

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:12.010
Interesting, that
kind of went down.

00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:14.366
How many believe
it's going to be B?

00:38:14.366 --> 00:38:15.610
A lot of people went up.

00:38:15.610 --> 00:38:18.010
How many think
it's going to be C?

00:38:18.010 --> 00:38:19.990
OK, still a couple hold outs.

00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:21.005
Let's do the experiment.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.330
So guys in the booth, can
you get a good shot of this,

00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:29.200
I hope?

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:33.000
I want this so it [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.510
All right.

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:36.700
Move the chalk.

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:38.410
Yep.

00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:42.980
And I'm going to
have to catch it.

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:44.410
All right.

00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:47.630
Let her rip.

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:48.680
Which way?

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:49.180
AUDIENCE: B.

00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:49.846
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:38:49.846 --> 00:38:50.636
Let's do it again.

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:59.820
Just make sure the guys in the
booth got a good shot of this.

00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:00.980
OK, once more.

00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:04.690
Pretty neat, huh?

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:16.640
If you're skiing downhill,
you're going down the hill,

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:22.545
accelerating, which way do you
feel the forces on your body?

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:30.560
You feel the forces
pulling you down straight?

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:33.630
Do you feel the forces
pulling you down the hill?

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:36.075
Do you feel the forces
pulling you into the hill?

00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:43.520
So this is straightforward
application of this.

00:39:46.295 --> 00:39:49.210
The slope of that liquid
was parallel to the slope.

00:40:00.685 --> 00:40:02.490
Get my notes back out here.

00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:29.550
So let's quickly do
this problem rigorously,

00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:34.320
the way we'd do
it straightforward

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:37.440
with accelerations and free
body diagrams and so forth.

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:43.009
We're going to have some
normal force pushing up.

00:40:43.009 --> 00:40:43.800
I said no friction.

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:47.420
This thing's a slippery surface,
just as if it's sliding down.

00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:50.590
Got to do rollers
in the classroom.

00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:51.320
It's got an mg.

00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:00.420
And there are no
other external forces.

00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:05.750
And we know then
that the summation

00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:09.380
of the external
forces, that's got

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:14.470
to be the mass times
the acceleration.

00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:17.950
And I'm going to make this here.

00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:21.310
I'll call this point
A in the center.

00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:24.290
And I'm going to make
my inertial reference

00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:28.445
frame x down the hill, y
perpendicular to the hill.

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:35.240
So the mass times the
acceleration of a with respect

00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:38.300
to o is then equal.

00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:40.840
And this is my then
external forces.

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:43.980
So this is my x direction.

00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:50.620
So I'm going to break this and
mg force into two components.

00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:52.090
One down the hill.

00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:53.450
Guess I need an angle.

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:02.590
Let's see.

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:17.820
So if this is theta,
then this is theta here.

00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:26.540
And the force down the
hill is that component

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:34.640
is mg sine theta.

00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:38.975
And the force this direction
is then going to be.

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:47.710
And I'll just give us
some unit vectors here

00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:49.230
to keep things straight.

00:42:49.230 --> 00:43:00.850
This force is minus mg cosine
theta in the j hat direction.

00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:06.790
So the sum of the forces
here, all of them,

00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:22.190
are mg sine theta i hat
minus mg cosine theta j hat

00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:25.680
plus n in the j hat direction.

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:28.670
So that's the total vector sum.

00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:35.590
And that's got to be equal to
my mass times the acceleration

00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:38.580
of a with respect to o.

00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:40.380
And we know that's
straight down the hill.

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:45.770
So this one's only going to
be in the i hat direction.

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:47.865
We know the acceleration
perpendicular

00:43:47.865 --> 00:43:50.080
hill has got to be 0.

00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:56.110
OK, so if we just add up the
components of this thing.

00:43:56.110 --> 00:44:00.360
In the i hat direction,
just the x direction,

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:06.300
then I have only this
term and that term.

00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:15.630
And I find that the
mg sine theta equals.

00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:31.300
And so the acceleration
of a with respect to o

00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:34.630
is just g sine theta.

00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:37.370
OK, well that's pretty trivial.

00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:47.910
And it doesn't give us
much insight about-- that

00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:50.300
doesn't give me much insight
about why that's the answer.

00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:55.630
So actually this is a
time when maybe thinking

00:44:55.630 --> 00:44:59.180
about if you're in that free,
you're going down the hill,

00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:02.760
you're skiing, and you're now
in an accelerating reference

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:05.220
frame, and you
want to say I want

00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:09.300
to work from this frame,
what fictitious force do

00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:11.570
I have to add to that
free body diagram

00:45:11.570 --> 00:45:14.315
so I can account
for my acceleration?

00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:35.720
So remember the
fictitious force we

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:39.190
want to deal with has
to do with this guy.

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:42.470
We're in the moving frame.

00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:43.880
We can't judge this.

00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:46.540
We're just told that it exists
and we need to correct for it.

00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:48.420
So we need a
fictitious force that's

00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:52.000
minus ma with respect to o.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.050
So that would be
minus mg sine theta.

00:45:56.050 --> 00:45:57.943
And that would be
in this direction.

00:45:57.943 --> 00:46:03.870
So dashed lines here is my mg
sine theta fictitious force.

00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:12.840
In the other direction was
the real force, the component

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:16.140
of gravity mg sine theta.

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:19.980
In this direction
was my normal force.

00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:24.630
And in this direction is
my component of gravity

00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:28.445
that is my mg cosine theta.

00:46:33.350 --> 00:46:34.360
It's a real force.

00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:37.810
So yeah, these real forces
and this fictitious force.

00:46:37.810 --> 00:46:42.860
But now we can say that all
these forces have to sum to 0.

00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:48.960
But look what happens here.

00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:52.940
What force do you feel?

00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:56.320
In the reference frame, you're
the skier going down the hill.

00:46:56.320 --> 00:47:01.030
What net forces do you feel on
you that are in the x direction

00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:01.680
down the hill?

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:09.370
0.

00:47:09.370 --> 00:47:10.270
It's exactly.

00:47:10.270 --> 00:47:13.300
The reason I did that silly
free fall problem a minute

00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:16.385
ago when you drop something,
when you're weightless,

00:47:16.385 --> 00:47:18.760
the scales are reading-- the
cable broke in the elevator,

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:20.190
scales read 0.

00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:23.030
The fictitious force
was equal and opposite

00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:25.150
to the gravitational
force you feel

00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:30.290
and the scales would show
no force in the free fall

00:47:30.290 --> 00:47:30.810
direction.

00:47:30.810 --> 00:47:32.790
In this case, you're
not free fall,

00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:35.010
but you're free
fall down a slope.

00:47:35.010 --> 00:47:37.270
In the component
down the slope, you

00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:38.880
have no net force
in that direction.

00:47:42.866 --> 00:47:46.410
In the reference frame
that moving cart,

00:47:46.410 --> 00:47:50.880
the only actual
force you feel is in.

00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:58.610
You will feel a force on your
feet equal to mg cosine theta.

00:47:58.610 --> 00:48:03.030
So if theta goes to 90
degrees, you're in free fall,

00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:05.380
and it goes to 0.

00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:08.740
Say it is 0 degrees, it's
max, and you would feel mg.

00:48:12.830 --> 00:48:15.042
This is [INAUDIBLE]
me where this notion

00:48:15.042 --> 00:48:16.500
of a fictitious
force kind of helps

00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:18.310
me figure out what's going on.

00:48:22.450 --> 00:48:24.550
Pretty amazing.

00:48:24.550 --> 00:48:25.280
OK.

00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:29.380
So we're going to move on
from this kind of discussion

00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:31.770
of fictitious forces of things.

00:48:31.770 --> 00:48:35.150
So it's been an hour.

00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:37.526
We'll take a little
break for a second.

00:48:37.526 --> 00:48:38.900
Also, if you've
got any questions

00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:41.439
about what we've covered up to
this point, think about them

00:48:41.439 --> 00:48:42.480
and ask them in a minute.

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:44.490
Let's take a short break.

00:48:44.490 --> 00:48:47.510
So while you've been taking
a break, a couple of people

00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:48.870
came up and asked questions.

00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:53.060
One of them was, are
fictitious forces real?

00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:55.915
And the other is, why
does the water move?

00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:04.830
So the answer to
the first question.

00:49:04.830 --> 00:49:11.520
If you want to be careful and
do the problem rigorously,

00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:15.650
don't mess with
fictitious forces.

00:49:15.650 --> 00:49:19.910
The only real forces
in the problem

00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:24.530
are the ones that you would put
on a free body diagram, such

00:49:24.530 --> 00:49:26.690
that the sum of
the external forces

00:49:26.690 --> 00:49:29.230
equals the mass
times acceleration.

00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:31.470
These forces are
always real ones.

00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:33.100
They are gravity.

00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:34.360
They are normal forces.

00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:35.510
They're friction.

00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:36.480
They're spring forces.

00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:37.780
They're dashpot forces.

00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:39.320
They're all these
mechanical things,

00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:41.560
but they're real forces.

00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:44.530
And the rod, that
thing spinning around,

00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:48.000
that rod, since it's a rigid
thing, it can support bending.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.200
So it has shear
force, axial forces.

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:55.780
Those are real forces that
it can put on the mass.

00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:59.050
Fictitious forces
are not forces.

00:49:59.050 --> 00:50:05.885
They are minus a mass
times a real what?

00:50:05.885 --> 00:50:06.426
Acceleration.

00:50:09.290 --> 00:50:11.820
So real forces,
real accelerations.

00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:14.585
We use this notion
of a fictitious force

00:50:14.585 --> 00:50:16.370
as a convenience.

00:50:16.370 --> 00:50:20.547
But it is a highly
dangerous tool.

00:50:20.547 --> 00:50:22.630
But actually once you get
used to it a little bit,

00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:24.540
it can give you some
really quick insight.

00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:26.950
But I would always, if I have
doubts, I'd always go back

00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:29.380
and just do the problem
the rigorous way and just

00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:32.400
check that your
insight was right.

00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:35.040
But it can give you a great
insight to starting a problem.

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:39.085
You know to expect a centrifugal
term in your results.

00:50:39.085 --> 00:50:42.495
You know to expect
a Coriolis term.

00:50:42.495 --> 00:50:51.390
You know that they're going to
be there because sometimes you

00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:52.632
feel them.

00:50:52.632 --> 00:50:55.400
The reason we like to use
them is because you actually

00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:58.310
can feel them.

00:50:58.310 --> 00:51:01.120
They actually affect
what you feel.

00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:17.040
So in that first problem, the
elevator problem, the answer--

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:19.680
I didn't actually write it.

00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:21.180
Here it is.

00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:24.490
The normal force that you
feel, that the scale weighs

00:51:24.490 --> 00:51:26.570
is 5 force g.

00:51:26.570 --> 00:51:30.073
And it's the sum of gravity
and that fictitious force.

00:51:30.073 --> 00:51:34.160
It's mg plus m times
a quarter of a g.

00:51:38.214 --> 00:51:40.630
It's in this moving references,
this accelerator reference

00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:43.080
frame inside an elevator
where you can't directly

00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:44.220
measure the acceleration.

00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:47.050
All you can measure
is the force.

00:51:47.050 --> 00:51:49.150
But you know what
the acceleration is.

00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:49.900
It's given.

00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:53.180
So you stick it in as
a fix and you find out

00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:56.250
that the real normal force
that you measure actually has

00:51:56.250 --> 00:52:00.130
in it that piece comes
from the fictitious force.

00:52:00.130 --> 00:52:01.100
OK.

00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:03.700
Why does the water move?

00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:07.190
This is really the
same discussion.

00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:11.630
The fictitious force up
the hill and the real force

00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:14.490
down the hill exactly cancel.

00:52:14.490 --> 00:52:17.340
If you're standing on
scales, it actually

00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:21.980
can measure side force
as well as normal force.

00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:26.520
Standing on the scales, you
would feel no side forces

00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:27.680
up and down the hill.

00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:29.470
None.

00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:32.950
You measure a normal force and
the normal force you measure

00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:37.110
will be mg cosine theta.

00:52:37.110 --> 00:52:43.840
So the force on any object in
that accelerating reference

00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:46.890
frame, it essentially
thinks that all forces are

00:52:46.890 --> 00:52:50.040
perpendicular, that you feel
in that reference frame,

00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:52.850
are perpendicular to the hill.

00:52:52.850 --> 00:52:57.900
So why does water seek level?

00:52:57.900 --> 00:53:00.630
Because the force
gravity is down

00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:02.930
and the surface of the
water goes perpendicular

00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:04.220
to the gravitational force.

00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:06.980
That's just the
nature of fluids.

00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:11.490
So if the force on all those
fluid particles is this angle,

00:53:11.490 --> 00:53:13.580
what's the fluid
level going to do?

00:53:13.580 --> 00:53:17.130
So that the pressure on the
surface is equal everywhere.

00:53:17.130 --> 00:53:20.090
And if you go a foot down,
you get equal pressure

00:53:20.090 --> 00:53:21.440
everywhere in the fluid.

00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:32.300
So the water moves
so that its surface

00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:35.820
will be perpendicular
to what it thinks.

00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:38.285
It thinks that this is kind
of being a local gravity.

00:53:38.285 --> 00:53:40.660
The local gravity is
pointed in that direction,

00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:43.880
so the surface level
seeks that level.

00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:46.440
If somebody else can
say it better than that.

00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:48.420
Tom, Dave, Matt, anybody?

00:53:54.694 --> 00:53:55.662
Yeah.

00:53:55.662 --> 00:53:57.224
AUDIENCE: Can I
ask you a question?

00:53:57.224 --> 00:53:57.890
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:54:01.422 --> 00:54:02.338
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:21.490
PROFESSOR: Yeah, as
if you're on the body

00:54:21.490 --> 00:54:23.800
and you're trying to sum
up all the forces you feel

00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:27.480
and accounting also for the
fact that this is accelerating.

00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:31.090
And the fix it force is
this fictitious force that's

00:54:31.090 --> 00:54:33.750
due to the body's acceleration.

00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:35.550
You have to know that
you're accelerating

00:54:35.550 --> 00:54:38.870
to be able to put this term in.

00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:42.530
And it comes from this
equation, thinking

00:54:42.530 --> 00:54:44.820
of this as a generic
equation by taking this term

00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:46.944
and just moving it to
this side and setting

00:54:46.944 --> 00:54:47.860
everything equal to 0.

00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:56.668
Lots of puzzlement around this.

00:54:56.668 --> 00:54:59.536
AUDIENCE: What happens if you
make the angle of the ramp very

00:54:59.536 --> 00:55:00.754
steep?

00:55:00.754 --> 00:55:01.670
PROFESSOR: Very steep.

00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:05.380
So if it goes to 90 degrees,
you're in free fall.

00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:13.350
This cosine theta goes
to 0, n goes to 0.

00:55:13.350 --> 00:55:14.580
This term stays the same.

00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:16.360
This goes to mg that way.

00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:17.540
This goes mg that way.

00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:18.915
And it's an
equilibrium in both--

00:55:18.915 --> 00:55:19.831
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:23.100
PROFESSOR: Then
you're going to have

00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:25.140
very, very small, normal force.

00:55:27.378 --> 00:55:28.294
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:31.452 --> 00:55:33.285
PROFESSOR: I couldn't
hear the last comment.

00:55:33.285 --> 00:55:35.710
AUDIENCE: The water wouldn't
go all the way to the side.

00:55:35.710 --> 00:55:37.650
It'd be vertical
length [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:40.570 --> 00:55:43.740
PROFESSOR: Well,
water, unfortunately,

00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:48.460
with the tiniest little
bit of normal force here

00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:49.950
the water will seek that level.

00:55:49.950 --> 00:55:57.210
But when it gets to 0 the water
is going to be in free fall.

00:55:57.210 --> 00:55:58.940
Surface tension takes over.

00:55:58.940 --> 00:55:59.910
Yeah?

00:55:59.910 --> 00:56:03.305
AUDIENCE: Is this like the
argument that [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:03.305 --> 00:56:06.215
is the same as if it was just
on a flat surface accelerating?

00:56:09.872 --> 00:56:11.080
PROFESSOR: Oh, good question.

00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:14.810
If you were on a flat
surface accelerating.

00:56:14.810 --> 00:56:19.110
If you were accelerating
in this cart.

00:56:19.110 --> 00:56:21.540
Accelerates with the
fluid on it and it's

00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:24.590
accelerating in
that direction, what

00:56:24.590 --> 00:56:26.160
would the surface
of the liquid do?

00:56:29.050 --> 00:56:32.610
Stay level or change?

00:56:32.610 --> 00:56:35.620
OK, does it slope back
or does it slope forward?

00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:38.120
I'm accelerating
in that direction.

00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:45.020
There's a fictitious
force pushing back on it,

00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:48.590
makes it pile up at the back.

00:56:48.590 --> 00:56:50.800
OK one more.

00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:52.566
You're in the elevator.

00:56:52.566 --> 00:56:54.415
You're accelerating
a quarter of a g.

00:56:58.070 --> 00:57:03.440
The scales tells you you weigh
25% more than you used to.

00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:04.490
And you have a pendulum.

00:57:04.490 --> 00:57:06.770
And before the
elevator starts, it's

00:57:06.770 --> 00:57:10.510
got a one second natural period.

00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:11.860
And now the elevator gets going.

00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:14.820
Does the period change?

00:57:14.820 --> 00:57:15.800
Higher or lower?

00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:16.716
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:21.045 --> 00:57:22.670
PROFESSOR: OK, so
the natural frequency

00:57:22.670 --> 00:57:25.044
of the pendulum, simple pendulum
square root of g over l.

00:57:25.044 --> 00:57:27.630
What do you guess that the
natural frequency is if you're

00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:29.950
going up at a quarter of a g?

00:57:34.855 --> 00:57:35.530
Say again?

00:57:35.530 --> 00:57:36.446
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:44.890 --> 00:57:49.590
PROFESSOR: It's as if you have
a higher or lower acceleration

00:57:49.590 --> 00:57:52.880
of gravity around.

00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:54.610
But you have a higher
gravitational force

00:57:54.610 --> 00:57:57.070
is what you think
you're feeling.

00:57:57.070 --> 00:58:00.050
Is that going to make the
tension in this string higher?

00:58:00.050 --> 00:58:02.690
Is that going to make the weight
of the pendulum feel greater?

00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:04.900
Yeah, by 5 force.

00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:06.630
And you'll find out,
you'll work out.

00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:09.915
It gets kind of messy to
prove this rigorously,

00:58:09.915 --> 00:58:12.415
but it's going to look something
like the square root of 5/4

00:58:12.415 --> 00:58:12.965
g over l.

00:58:15.610 --> 00:58:16.110
OK.

00:58:31.682 --> 00:58:32.890
We've got a little time left.

00:58:32.890 --> 00:58:35.300
I might not be able to
completely finish this.

00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:36.900
But I do want to
show you something.

00:58:59.321 --> 00:59:00.570
Hold it up so they can see it.

00:59:06.157 --> 00:59:07.490
Gets pretty violent, doesn't it?

00:59:07.490 --> 00:59:08.280
Pass it around.

00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:17.110
OK.

00:59:17.110 --> 00:59:18.975
This thing is
shaking like crazy.

00:59:23.515 --> 00:59:24.015
All right.

00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:30.800
All right.

00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:33.022
In the absence of
external forces,

00:59:33.022 --> 00:59:34.980
what can you say about
the motion of its center

00:59:34.980 --> 00:59:36.490
of gravity, do you think?

00:59:36.490 --> 00:59:39.760
In at least this direction.

00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:41.160
Can't move, right?

00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:44.310
Up and down direction
the center of gravity

00:59:44.310 --> 00:59:48.120
does move, because I'm putting
a force on it through the cord.

00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:52.360
This has a relation
to a problem that you

00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:56.289
had on problem set two.

00:59:56.289 --> 00:59:58.330
I want to go back and talk
about it a little bit.

01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:09.900
And this is that thing
with the track in it.

01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:11.550
And a roller going around.

01:00:11.550 --> 01:00:13.415
And it's going to around
at constant speed.

01:00:13.415 --> 01:00:15.310
And this has mass m.

01:00:15.310 --> 01:00:16.990
This is mass.

01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:20.720
The outside thing is just
the mass of this block.

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:22.991
And there's an internal
donut in here, [INAUDIBLE],

01:00:22.991 --> 01:00:24.865
and this mass is made
to go around and around

01:00:24.865 --> 01:00:26.750
and around and around inside.

01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:33.500
And you were asked to figure out
the acceleration of that guy.

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:35.058
But this thing's on wheels.

01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:52.380
Now, this problem,
and I apologize

01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:55.730
for posing this
problem the way I did.

01:00:55.730 --> 01:00:59.510
I should have posed
in the following way.

01:00:59.510 --> 01:01:04.910
These two problems are
really equal to one another.

01:01:04.910 --> 01:01:06.720
I have a rod.

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:08.850
I have a mass on the end.

01:01:08.850 --> 01:01:12.680
This radius here we said was e.

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:14.370
This radius is e.

01:01:14.370 --> 01:01:15.670
The mass is the same.

01:01:15.670 --> 01:01:16.980
It's m.

01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:20.530
This was going around at omega.

01:01:20.530 --> 01:01:24.580
This is going around at omega.

01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:25.920
This is on wheels.

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:30.970
Exactly these two
problems are identical.

01:01:30.970 --> 01:01:33.294
Because if the
geometry's the same,

01:01:33.294 --> 01:01:34.960
the rotation rate's
the same, the masses

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:37.770
are the same, the acceleration
of this bead here,

01:01:37.770 --> 01:01:39.790
this roller is the
same in this problem

01:01:39.790 --> 01:01:41.880
as it is in that problem.

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:43.600
Just in this problem
it's much easier

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:46.360
to figure out the forces.

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:48.100
This turned out to
be kind of nasty.

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:49.840
And I said last time
that the solution

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:53.430
to b part, which is the
normal force that this

01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:56.450
is put on this roller, I
said that answer was wrong.

01:01:56.450 --> 01:01:59.790
I actually am wrong about that.

01:01:59.790 --> 01:02:01.480
I was thinking of
a different answer.

01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:04.780
I was thinking of this problem.

01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:08.590
The answer that was given,
the normal force that

01:02:08.590 --> 01:02:11.770
is by the track places
on the roller or vice

01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:15.390
versa is actually what
was given is correct.

01:02:15.390 --> 01:02:17.070
It wasn't what I
actually was seeking

01:02:17.070 --> 01:02:18.111
when I wrote the problem.

01:02:18.111 --> 01:02:20.290
Sometimes when you're
making up problems,

01:02:20.290 --> 01:02:23.040
you have an end result in mind
and then you wrote it wrong.

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.560
I wrote it wrong.

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:25.950
So let's do this problem.

01:02:29.470 --> 01:02:34.550
This is partly to review a
couple of things for you.

01:02:34.550 --> 01:02:40.700
What I really want is I want
to find equation of motion

01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:44.549
in-- [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:54.980
So here's my xyz
inertial reference frame.

01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:57.284
I just lined it up
here with the center

01:02:57.284 --> 01:02:58.450
of this thing to start with.

01:02:58.450 --> 01:02:59.780
Doesn't really matter.

01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:02.570
So I want to find an equation
of motion in the x direction.

01:03:06.049 --> 01:03:08.090
We don't have time to do
this whole problem here,

01:03:08.090 --> 01:03:12.850
so I'm going to do
the first piece of it.

01:03:12.850 --> 01:03:15.910
Just to give you some review,
an exercise in figuring out

01:03:15.910 --> 01:03:18.910
degrees of freedom.

01:03:18.910 --> 01:03:21.075
I'm implying that I
can write one equation.

01:03:21.075 --> 01:03:23.140
It may take more than that.

01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:27.230
So the number of degrees
of freedom we said

01:03:27.230 --> 01:03:35.122
is equal to the
number of required--

01:03:35.122 --> 01:03:46.550
I can't write today--
independent coordinates.

01:03:46.550 --> 01:03:50.540
So the number of coordinates
required to completely describe

01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:51.710
the motion.

01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:54.120
And we came up a little
expression for that.

01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:56.890
It's 6 times the
number rigid bodies

01:03:56.890 --> 01:04:00.700
plus 3 times the
number of particles.

01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:04.052
So this is rigid bodies.

01:04:04.052 --> 01:04:05.195
This is particles.

01:04:11.650 --> 01:04:13.360
Minus c.

01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:14.610
And these are the constraints.

01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:21.450
So let's figure that
out for this problem.

01:04:37.002 --> 01:04:38.390
So how many constraints?

01:04:38.390 --> 01:04:41.650
It's just a quick practice.

01:04:41.650 --> 01:04:43.880
So constraints and
I'm going to start off

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:50.370
with on the main block.

01:04:50.370 --> 01:04:56.710
So on the main block,
there's no y motion.

01:04:56.710 --> 01:04:57.930
There's no z motion.

01:04:57.930 --> 01:05:00.450
These rollers don't
let it come in or out.

01:05:00.450 --> 01:05:06.385
So no y or z motion.

01:05:09.557 --> 01:05:10.640
So that's two constraints.

01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:15.750
What about rotations
on the main block?

01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:19.670
How many constraints
are we assuming here?

01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:20.540
Three.

01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:23.480
We're not allowing it the
role in x, the y, or the z.

01:05:33.238 --> 01:05:36.400
So there's three
more constraints.

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.215
And now on the little mass.

01:05:42.090 --> 01:05:44.590
On the little mass,
there's no z motion.

01:05:44.590 --> 01:05:45.590
That's out of the board.

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:56.110
That's one more constraint.

01:05:56.110 --> 01:06:16.030
And then omega t is the
angle that this thing.

01:06:16.030 --> 01:06:17.980
It's theta.

01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:18.760
This is specified.

01:06:25.704 --> 01:06:26.870
It's a given in the problem.

01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:27.589
It's not unknown.

01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:29.130
It's just that's
what's going, that's

01:06:29.130 --> 01:06:30.720
what makes this
thing do its thing.

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:32.570
It's going round and round.

01:06:32.570 --> 01:06:35.130
And so this is not an unknown.

01:06:35.130 --> 01:06:47.410
And therefore you can say that
the y motion of this particle

01:06:47.410 --> 01:06:52.030
is e sine omega t.

01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:57.320
And that's a constraint.

01:06:57.320 --> 01:07:07.820
And the x motion is the
motion of the main block

01:07:07.820 --> 01:07:17.260
to which it's attached
plus an e cosine omega t.

01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:19.187
And these are knowns.

01:07:19.187 --> 01:07:20.520
You've already counted for this.

01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:23.150
That's the main mass's motion.

01:07:23.150 --> 01:07:25.190
So this is something known.

01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:27.840
So these mount up,
each one of these.

01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:32.946
This gives you a constraint and
this gives you a constraint.

01:07:32.946 --> 01:07:34.690
And so let's add them up.

01:07:34.690 --> 01:07:36.970
So 2 and 3 are 5.

01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:41.390
6, 7, 8.

01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:44.150
So you can actually
completely describe

01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:48.185
the motion of this thing
with one equation of motion.

01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:01.540
So I'm seeking.

01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:10.593
So I want to find the sum
of the external forces

01:08:10.593 --> 01:08:19.310
on the main block
in the x direction.

01:08:19.310 --> 01:08:21.050
And that's going to be.

01:08:21.050 --> 01:08:25.245
We know that that's the mass of
that block times x double dot.

01:08:25.245 --> 01:08:28.270
So x is going to be the
coordinate that describes

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:30.620
the motion that mass mb.

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:41.010
So we need a free
body diagram of mb.

01:08:55.150 --> 01:08:56.370
So here's the block.

01:08:59.850 --> 01:09:03.030
There'll be a normal force up.

01:09:03.030 --> 01:09:08.775
There's going to
be mbg downwards.

01:09:08.775 --> 01:09:12.640
And the only other forces
acting on this block

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:22.090
are a force that comes through
this rod that's holding

01:09:22.090 --> 01:09:23.659
that mass, the little mass.

01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:36.660
I'm just going to draw it
at some arbitrary angle,

01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:39.130
not necessarily theta.

01:09:39.130 --> 01:09:41.460
It's going to be a force.

01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:48.229
I'm going to call that
force on this main mass.

01:09:48.229 --> 01:09:49.630
And it's a vector
for the moment.

01:09:49.630 --> 01:09:51.955
It'll have two components
in the x and y directions.

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:05.280
So in order to write an
equation-- in the y direction

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:10.520
it's trivial. n is equal to mbg.

01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:14.240
In this direction, we
have to have to break this

01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:15.320
into two components.

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:19.240
We need to know the component
of this in the x direction

01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:23.800
and put it in here
and we'll be done.

01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:32.570
So now I'm going
to use third law.

01:10:32.570 --> 01:10:39.420
The force that rod
places on this body

01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:43.400
is equal and opposite
to the force at the rod

01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:46.900
places on the mass
going round and round.

01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:47.650
You agree with me?

01:10:51.010 --> 01:10:55.060
So what we need to
do next is here's

01:10:55.060 --> 01:10:58.500
the mass up here going
around and round.

01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:07.060
And the force is on it,
because it has an mg downward.

01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:12.350
And it has some
force on it that is

01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:15.700
the force on the little mass.

01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:19.170
And you're going to find
that f on the little mass

01:11:19.170 --> 01:11:27.060
equals minus f on the big mass
due to third law consideration.

01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:30.050
So all I have to do
is then figure out

01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:34.350
the x component of this force,
put a minus sign in front

01:11:34.350 --> 01:11:37.900
of it, and I'm basically done.

01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:39.870
And to do that I
say f equals ma.

01:11:39.870 --> 01:11:41.210
I don't have to finish it today.

01:11:41.210 --> 01:11:42.870
I'll show you next time.

01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:47.596
And we'll figure out
the equation of motion

01:11:47.596 --> 01:11:48.220
for this thing.

01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:51.590
Now, in dragging all
this stuff here today,

01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:54.532
I forgot to bring
my muddy cards.

01:11:54.532 --> 01:11:55.490
So you've got a minute.

01:11:55.490 --> 01:11:57.160
And if any of you have
just a brilliant question

01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:58.909
you want to answer or
something you really

01:11:58.909 --> 01:12:02.130
liked, if you don't mind,
just take a piece of paper,

01:12:02.130 --> 01:12:05.310
make a note on it, and
drop it off on the way out.

01:12:05.310 --> 01:12:05.960
Thanks a lot.

01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:08.320
See you on Thursday.
