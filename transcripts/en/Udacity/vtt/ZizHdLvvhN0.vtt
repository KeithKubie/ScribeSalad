00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Another thing to think about is what's the market size estimate?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
How big is this and what's the percentage marketshare realistically you could get?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
How many can you distribution channel actually sell?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
If you have your own direct sales people, do the math.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
How many customers can they call on it at what price?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
As you start putting all this into a spread sheet

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
you actually start building the classic income statement balance sheet and cashflow

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
we haven't even had you do yet.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
If you think about this, this entire conversation we've had

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
was how to get the basic data so you can put together a revenue model

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
that's based on fact rather than fiction.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
You are going to start thinking about, well, if I have a direct sales force,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
how much can they sell in dollars,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
or if I'm using an indirect channel, what's realistic number they sell for other customers?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
How much will it cost to have this distribution channel?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Hopefully in the last lecture you start thinking about the cost of you channelâ€”

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
how many customer activations, how much it will cost to get customers

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
into my physical store or my virtual website.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Then as we talked about earlier, how much will it cost to acquire a customer?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And by the way, not only how much does my customer acquisition cost

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
but what's their lifetime value?

00:01:16.000 --> 99:59:59.000
How many units will they by from each of these efforts?
