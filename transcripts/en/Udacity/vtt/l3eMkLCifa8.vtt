00:00:00.318 --> 00:00:03.680
Although typically View-port is only being set on Load, you can

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.000
actually play around with the View-port settings in the development tools

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.440
to tweak it, and get it just right. If I go

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.430
into the page and set the Viewport meta element contents from

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.480
the mobile dev tools It will change the page, as if

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.400
it had been refreshed, however, and this is where it gets

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.720
a bit confusing, the zoom level is maintained by the browser

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.480
across pager refreshes, so when you change viewport settings in the source

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.430
code, and you're reloading, be sure to actually close

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.620
the tab first. Don't just hit reload or it won't

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.200
necesarilly show the effects on the screen. For example,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.510
let's go back to our last bit of code. And

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.240
change that width to something really different. Let's double

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.610
the width to 1832. And now let's save that to

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.618
the server and reload it on our mobile device. Our

00:00:47.618 --> 00:00:50.650
new View-port setting doesn't take effect. On the other hand,

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.770
if we close the tab first and then reopen it, our new View-port

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.090
setting now takes effect. So pro tip, always remember to close the tab.
