energy is a big part of the problem and

00:36:38.890 --> 00:36:38.900
energy is a big part of the problem and
 

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:41.350
energy is a big part of the problem and
so i'm going to talk a bit about how we

00:36:41.350 --> 00:36:41.360
so i'm going to talk a bit about how we
 

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:44.620
so i'm going to talk a bit about how we
might begin to reduce carbon emissions

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:44.630
might begin to reduce carbon emissions
 

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:47.890
might begin to reduce carbon emissions
from the energy system in fact we have

00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:47.900
from the energy system in fact we have
 

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:50.080
from the energy system in fact we have
to reduce them by something like eighty

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:50.090
to reduce them by something like eighty
 

00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:52.800
to reduce them by something like eighty
percent or more because unlike

oxides of nitrogen which stay in the

00:36:57.490 --> 00:36:57.500
oxides of nitrogen which stay in the
 

00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:59.590
oxides of nitrogen which stay in the
atmosphere for just a few hours or a day

00:36:59.590 --> 00:36:59.600
atmosphere for just a few hours or a day
 

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:03.070
atmosphere for just a few hours or a day
or two carbon dioxide stays in the

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:03.080
or two carbon dioxide stays in the
 

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:05.230
or two carbon dioxide stays in the
atmosphere for as much as a century or

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:05.240
atmosphere for as much as a century or
 

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:06.790
atmosphere for as much as a century or
more and so it's like a big bathtub

00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:06.800
more and so it's like a big bathtub
 

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.200
more and so it's like a big bathtub
that's as though we had an enormous

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:08.210
that's as though we had an enormous
 

00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:11.140
that's as though we had an enormous
faucet and a relatively small drain and

00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:11.150
faucet and a relatively small drain and
 

00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:12.730
faucet and a relatively small drain and
unless we close the faucet down

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:12.740
unless we close the faucet down
 

00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:15.400
unless we close the faucet down
dramatically the bathtub is just going

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:15.410
dramatically the bathtub is just going
 

00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:17.950
dramatically the bathtub is just going
to continue to fill up so we got to

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:17.960
to continue to fill up so we got to
 

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:20.430
to continue to fill up so we got to
figure out how do we close that faucet

00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:20.440
figure out how do we close that faucet
 

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:23.800
figure out how do we close that faucet
and energy is a big part of the answer

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:23.810
and energy is a big part of the answer
 

00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:27.490
and energy is a big part of the answer
now energy is in fact energy systems are

00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:27.500
now energy is in fact energy systems are
 

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:29.070
now energy is in fact energy systems are

01:11:30.609 --> 01:11:30.619
student asked me the other day well how
 

01:11:30.619 --> 01:11:32.109
student asked me the other day well how
should I think differently and I said

01:11:32.109 --> 01:11:32.119
should I think differently and I said
 

01:11:32.119 --> 01:11:34.450
should I think differently and I said
well for starters you know if you're

01:11:34.450 --> 01:11:34.460
well for starters you know if you're
 

01:11:34.460 --> 01:11:35.800
well for starters you know if you're
sitting in the Sun you'd better be a

01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:35.810
sitting in the Sun you'd better be a
 

01:11:35.810 --> 01:11:38.200
sitting in the Sun you'd better be a
power generator you know as black

01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:38.210
power generator you know as black
 

01:11:38.210 --> 01:11:40.899
power generator you know as black
top buildings you go on and on I said

01:11:40.899 --> 01:11:40.909
top buildings you go on and on I said
 

01:11:40.909 --> 01:11:42.729
top buildings you go on and on I said
just start thinking about generating

01:11:42.729 --> 01:11:42.739
just start thinking about generating
 

01:11:42.739 --> 01:11:45.729
just start thinking about generating
power from an orientation standpoint as

01:11:45.729 --> 01:11:45.739
power from an orientation standpoint as
 

01:11:45.739 --> 01:11:46.990
power from an orientation standpoint as
opposed to what are you going to get to

01:11:46.990 --> 01:11:47.000
opposed to what are you going to get to
 

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.939
opposed to what are you going to get to
drive what you're building from an

01:11:48.939 --> 01:11:48.949
drive what you're building from an
 

01:11:48.949 --> 01:11:51.700
drive what you're building from an
engineering standpoint what changes in

01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:51.710
engineering standpoint what changes in
 

01:11:51.710 --> 01:11:54.010
engineering standpoint what changes in
mindset do we need to teach the

01:11:54.010 --> 01:11:54.020
mindset do we need to teach the
 

01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:58.479
mindset do we need to teach the
engineers that are coming along well we

01:11:58.479 --> 01:11:58.489
engineers that are coming along well we
 

01:11:58.489 --> 01:12:01.109
engineers that are coming along well we
need to get them thinking about

01:12:01.109 --> 01:12:01.119
need to get them thinking about
 

01:12:01.119 --> 01:12:03.729
need to get them thinking about
innovation and as a matter of fact the

01:12:03.729 --> 01:12:03.739
innovation and as a matter of fact the

together a a study group here at
 

01:12:09.409 --> 01:12:13.180
together a a study group here at
Carnegie Mellon to figure out how we get

01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:13.190
Carnegie Mellon to figure out how we get
 

01:12:13.190 --> 01:12:15.209
Carnegie Mellon to figure out how we get
our engineering undergraduates of

01:12:15.209 --> 01:12:15.219
our engineering undergraduates of
 

01:12:15.219 --> 01:12:17.800
our engineering undergraduates of
thinking more about developing

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:17.810
thinking more about developing

the sorts of cap and trade strategies
 

01:12:26.030 --> 01:12:30.189
the sorts of cap and trade strategies
that we talked about will presumably

that we talked about will presumably
 

01:12:30.199 --> 01:12:33.310
that we talked about will presumably
provide some market forces without

also of course substantially increased

01:12:46.089 --> 01:12:46.099
also of course substantially increased
 

01:12:46.099 --> 01:12:48.669
also of course substantially increased

01:12:51.070 --> 01:12:51.080
new technologies a little later on Lee
 

01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:52.899

and I may have a bit of an argument over

01:12:52.899 --> 01:12:52.909
and I may have a bit of an argument over
 

01:12:52.909 --> 01:12:56.020
and I may have a bit of an argument over
whether cap-and-trade is the right is

whether cap-and-trade is the right is
 

01:12:56.030 --> 01:12:59.080
whether cap-and-trade is the right is
the only strategy to adopt but i'll save

01:12:59.080 --> 01:12:59.090
the only strategy to adopt but i'll save
 

01:12:59.090 --> 01:13:01.950
the only strategy to adopt but i'll save
that for later

01:13:01.950 --> 01:13:01.960
 

01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:11.740
yeah first question we have great when

01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:11.750
yeah first question we have great when
 

01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:13.990
yeah first question we have great when
you have a there we go run right over

01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:14.000
you have a there we go run right over
 

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.430
you have a there we go run right over
here was the hero a a missed opportunity

01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:17.440
here was the hero a a missed opportunity
 

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:22.029
here was the hero a a missed opportunity
Kyoto shall we have signed could you

01:13:22.029 --> 01:13:22.039
Kyoto shall we have signed could you
 

01:13:22.039 --> 01:13:25.209

hear that was the Kyoto Accord when we

01:13:25.209 --> 01:13:25.219
hear that was the Kyoto Accord when we
 

01:13:25.219 --> 01:13:27.189
hear that was the Kyoto Accord when we
were negotiating worldwide was that a

01:13:27.189 --> 01:13:27.199
were negotiating worldwide was that a
 

01:13:27.199 --> 01:13:29.649
were negotiating worldwide was that a
lost opportunity was that something we

01:13:29.649 --> 01:13:29.659
lost opportunity was that something we
 

01:13:29.659 --> 01:13:30.819
lost opportunity was that something we
should have signed what would have

01:13:30.819 --> 01:13:30.829
should have signed what would have
 

01:13:30.829 --> 01:13:37.560
should have signed what would have
changed to enable us to go on with it

01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:37.570
 

01:13:37.570 --> 01:13:41.890
should we assign the Kyoto Accords what

01:13:41.890 --> 01:13:41.900
should we assign the Kyoto Accords what
 

01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:50.140
should we assign the Kyoto Accords what
should we we just got a lot of

01:13:50.140 --> 01:13:50.150
should we we just got a lot of
 

01:13:50.150 --> 01:13:53.350

technology birpur actually we did sign

01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:53.360
technology birpur actually we did sign
 

01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:55.479

the Kyoto agreement we just failed to

01:13:55.479 --> 01:13:55.489
the Kyoto agreement we just failed to
 

01:13:55.489 --> 01:14:01.270
the Kyoto agreement we just failed to
ratify it and and in in in my opinion we

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:01.280
ratify it and and in in in my opinion we
 

01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:03.370
ratify it and and in in in my opinion we
should have ratified it notwithstanding

01:14:03.370 --> 01:14:03.380
should have ratified it notwithstanding
 

01:14:03.380 --> 01:14:06.430
should have ratified it notwithstanding
its flaws and we should have then worked

01:14:06.430 --> 01:14:06.440
its flaws and we should have then worked
 

01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:09.910
its flaws and we should have then worked
to move to to fix those flaws as we

01:14:09.910 --> 01:14:09.920
to move to to fix those flaws as we
 

01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:11.859
to move to to fix those flaws as we
moved ahead we should have tried to fix

01:14:11.859 --> 01:14:11.869
moved ahead we should have tried to fix
 

01:14:11.869 --> 01:14:14.649
moved ahead we should have tried to fix

this point the Kyoto Accord is basically

01:14:23.109 --> 01:14:23.119
this point the Kyoto Accord is basically
 

01:14:23.119 --> 01:14:27.310
this point the Kyoto Accord is basically
moot that is most of the countries that

what the penalty would be for failing to

01:14:34.330 --> 01:14:34.340
what the penalty would be for failing to
 

01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:35.830
what the penalty would be for failing to
meet the targets I think one of the ways

01:14:35.830 --> 01:14:35.840
meet the targets I think one of the ways

or their largest concern I don't really

01:24:34.750 --> 01:24:34.760
or their largest concern I don't really
 

01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:38.740
or their largest concern I don't really
have the answer i mean like i said the

01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:38.750
have the answer i mean like i said the
 

01:24:38.750 --> 01:24:41.350
have the answer i mean like i said the
economy and the housing crisis and the

01:24:41.350 --> 01:24:41.360
economy and the housing crisis and the
 

01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:43.920

financial system collapses all at the

01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:43.930
financial system collapses all at the
 

01:24:43.930 --> 01:24:46.840
financial system collapses all at the
front of our minds right now but this is

01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:46.850
front of our minds right now but this is
 

01:24:46.850 --> 01:24:48.880
front of our minds right now but this is
a problem that's not going to go away

01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:48.890
a problem that's not going to go away
 

01:24:48.890 --> 01:24:52.480
a problem that's not going to go away
and it is something that the next

01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:52.490
and it is something that the next
 

01:24:52.490 --> 01:24:53.950
and it is something that the next
president is going to have to deal with

01:24:53.950 --> 01:24:53.960
president is going to have to deal with
 

01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:56.410
president is going to have to deal with
and I think it's still a factor in the

01:24:56.410 --> 01:24:56.420
and I think it's still a factor in the
 

01:24:56.420 --> 01:24:58.420
and I think it's still a factor in the
way people are going to vote in the

01:24:58.420 --> 01:24:58.430
way people are going to vote in the
 

01:24:58.430 --> 01:25:07.780
way people are going to vote in the
election right here I'm not convinced

01:25:07.780 --> 01:25:07.790

and no it won't be extraordinarily
 

01:26:12.140 --> 01:26:14.290
and no it won't be extraordinarily
expensive but it will require carbon

01:26:14.290 --> 01:26:14.300
expensive but it will require carbon

the reality is that whatever we do it's

the reality is that whatever we do it's
 

01:29:09.470 --> 01:29:12.690

so yeah it takes about forty dollars a

01:30:02.550 --> 01:30:02.560
so yeah it takes about forty dollars a
 

01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:04.680
so yeah it takes about forty dollars a

putting in lots of wind around and we're
subsidizing it to do it but you know

01:30:10.470 --> 01:30:10.480

one big idea one single idea that you
 

01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:40.290
one big idea one single idea that you
want this president elect to hear I'm

01:30:40.290 --> 01:30:40.300
want this president elect to hear I'm
 

01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:46.980
want this president elect to hear I'm
gonna start with you Mickey well the big

01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:46.990
gonna start with you Mickey well the big
 

01:30:46.990 --> 01:30:50.610
gonna start with you Mickey well the big
idea is that there is no single solution

01:30:50.610 --> 01:30:50.620
idea is that there is no single solution
 

01:30:50.620 --> 01:30:54.560
idea is that there is no single solution
and then it's going to take a holistic

01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:54.570
and then it's going to take a holistic
 

01:30:54.570 --> 01:30:57.300
and then it's going to take a holistic
multi-faceted approach and we need to do

01:30:57.300 --> 01:30:57.310
multi-faceted approach and we need to do
 

01:30:57.310 --> 01:30:58.890
multi-faceted approach and we need to do
something right now not just something

01:30:58.890 --> 01:30:58.900
something right now not just something
 

01:30:58.900 --> 01:31:01.500
something right now not just something
but but everything get the wheels moving

01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:01.510
but but everything get the wheels moving
 

01:31:01.510 --> 01:31:04.190
but but everything get the wheels moving
and really take this issue seriously

01:31:04.190 --> 01:31:04.200
and really take this issue seriously
 

01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:08.130
and really take this issue seriously
thank you Lee well it's probably no

surprise cap and trade
 

01:31:10.889 --> 01:31:14.100
surprise cap and trade
but the right cap and trade okay that's

01:31:14.100 --> 01:31:14.110
but the right cap and trade okay that's
 

01:31:14.110 --> 01:31:15.540
but the right cap and trade okay that's
the right place to start and there's

01:31:15.540 --> 01:31:15.550
the right place to start and there's
 

01:31:15.550 --> 01:31:16.950
the right place to start and there's
going to be a heck of a political fight

01:31:16.950 --> 01:31:16.960
going to be a heck of a political fight
 

01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:19.979
going to be a heck of a political fight
to get there we want to avoid pushes to

01:31:19.979 --> 01:31:19.989
to get there we want to avoid pushes to
 

01:31:19.989 --> 01:31:22.770
to get there we want to avoid pushes to
exempt industries right we want to avoid

01:31:22.770 --> 01:31:22.780
exempt industries right we want to avoid
 

01:31:22.780 --> 01:31:25.560

the push to have free allocation forever

01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:25.570
the push to have free allocation forever
 

01:31:25.570 --> 01:31:27.930
the push to have free allocation forever
and I think it would be useful to have a

01:31:27.930 --> 01:31:27.940
and I think it would be useful to have a
 

01:31:27.940 --> 01:31:30.209
and I think it would be useful to have a
safety valve for a carbon fit right

01:31:30.209 --> 01:31:30.219
safety valve for a carbon fit right
 

01:31:30.219 --> 01:31:33.330
safety valve for a carbon fit right
Granger well we got a mess in the

01:31:33.330 --> 01:31:33.340
Granger well we got a mess in the
 

01:31:33.340 --> 01:31:35.220
Granger well we got a mess in the
economy and one way to work our way out

01:31:35.220 --> 01:31:35.230
economy and one way to work our way out
 

01:31:35.230 --> 01:31:37.379
economy and one way to work our way out
of it is to start building stuff and

01:31:37.379 --> 01:31:37.389
of it is to start building stuff and
 

01:31:37.389 --> 01:31:41.280
of it is to start building stuff and
hiring people to do it before you start

01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:41.290
hiring people to do it before you start
 

01:31:41.290 --> 01:31:42.810
hiring people to do it before you start
spending money you need to talk with

01:31:42.810 --> 01:31:42.820
spending money you need to talk with
 

01:31:42.820 --> 01:31:44.550
spending money you need to talk with
folks who've done some careful analysis

01:31:44.550 --> 01:31:44.560
folks who've done some careful analysis
 

01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:46.770
folks who've done some careful analysis
you don't want to waste money but

01:31:46.770 --> 01:31:46.780
you don't want to waste money but
 

01:31:46.780 --> 01:31:48.149
you don't want to waste money but
there's a lot of things we could start

01:31:48.149 --> 01:31:48.159
there's a lot of things we could start
 

01:31:48.159 --> 01:31:50.310
there's a lot of things we could start
doing now that involve putting concrete

01:31:50.310 --> 01:31:50.320
doing now that involve putting concrete
 

01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:52.589
doing now that involve putting concrete
in the ground and bending steel and we

01:31:52.589 --> 01:31:52.599
in the ground and bending steel and we
 

01:31:52.599 --> 01:32:00.540
in the ground and bending steel and we
need to start yeah my advice would be

01:32:00.540 --> 01:32:00.550
need to start yeah my advice would be
 

01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:03.870
need to start yeah my advice would be
very similar to Granger's the key point

01:32:03.870 --> 01:32:03.880
very similar to Granger's the key point
 

01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:05.850
very similar to Granger's the key point
I would make is that although the

01:32:05.850 --> 01:32:05.860
I would make is that although the
 

01:32:05.860 --> 01:32:08.220
I would make is that although the
economy must now be very high on the

01:32:08.220 --> 01:32:08.230
economy must now be very high on the
 

01:32:08.230 --> 01:32:10.740
economy must now be very high on the
national agenda the link between the

01:32:10.740 --> 01:32:10.750
national agenda the link between the
 

01:32:10.750 --> 01:32:12.839
national agenda the link between the
energy issue the climate issue and the

01:32:12.839 --> 01:32:12.849
energy issue the climate issue and the
 

01:32:12.849 --> 01:32:15.990
energy issue the climate issue and the
economy is an intense one and the fact

01:32:15.990 --> 01:32:16.000
economy is an intense one and the fact
 

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.510
economy is an intense one and the fact
is the risks to our economy are far

01:32:18.510 --> 01:32:18.520
is the risks to our economy are far
 

01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:21.060
