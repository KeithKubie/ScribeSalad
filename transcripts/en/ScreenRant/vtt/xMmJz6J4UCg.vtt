00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:12.430
Since his creation back in 1962, Spider-Man
has proven to be one of the most beloved and

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.510
iconic superheroes in comic book history.
In the modern age of summer blockbusters,

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.599
that means just about any Spider-Man movie
can find success (if handled properly). As

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:26.430
a new Spider-Man movie universe approaches
(with a little help from Marvel Studios),

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.430
there�s no time like the present for the
webslinger to head into new territory � calling

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.820
on acclaimed comics to take him there. Here
are ScreenRant�s 5 Spider-Man Stories We

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.470
Want To See on Film.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.380
The Death of Jean DeWolff

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.450
Spider-Man has encountered dozens of supervillains
over the years, but when police Captain Jean

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.290
De Wolff is murdered in her home, it's not
supervillain to blame. Instead, it's a delusional

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.210
serial killer known as �The Sin-Eater�
whose choice of victim puts him on Spider-Man�s

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.920
radar. The brutal murder forces Peter Parker
to once again face the street-level crime

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.469
of New York City, and his hunger for revenge
is only stopped when Daredevil intervenes,

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.290
offering to help Spidey catch the killer.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.220
Comic fans may scoff at the idea of such a
�serious� or �gritty� Spider-Man film,

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:18.080
as opposed to the high-flying fantasy of previous
movie outings, but the shift in perspective

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.890
� and the Daredevil team-up � would be
a welcome change.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.250
Back in Black

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.030
Since Marvel�s �Civil War� event is
now coming to the Avengers movie universe,

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.640
it seems a long shot that Peter Parker could
once again play a key role in the conflict

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.780
between Iron Man and Captain America. Whether
or not Peter unmasks himself on the big screen,

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.820
in the comics it�s the fallout of �going
public� that truly cost him. When a hitman�s

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.890
bullet intended for Peter strikes his Aunt
May instead, his gloves come off, and his

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.950
classic black costume goes on, as Peter sets
out to kill � yes, I said kill � those

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.840
responsible.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.000
Seeing Peter Parker lose control may not be
for every movie fan, but the �Back in Black�

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.440
storyline reminds us why it�s the heroes
who must wear masks, and features a number

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.860
of scenes perfect for the big screen. The
story�s climax � in which Peter removes

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.130
his suit to show it isn�t Spider-Man seeking
revenge, but the man behind the mask � is

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.310
a moment every fan should get to witness in
theatres.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.800
Kraven�s Last Hunt

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.641
No matter how high the stakes may rise in
a superhero movie, audiences know that the

00:02:16.641 --> 00:02:20.879
life of the hero is never really in jeopardy.
But that isn�t the case in �Kraven�s

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:25.959
Last Hunt�. This comic arc sees classic
villain Kraven the Hunter challenge, defeat,

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.640
and kill Spider-Man. Kraven then takes up
the mantle himself, carrying out vigilante

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.150
justice in a fashion closer to Batman than
Spider-Man, proving that there is much, much

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.050
more to being a hero than punishing criminals.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.000
Peter Parker would obviously return, but the
point was made perfectly clear: �Spider-Man�

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.770
isn�t a mask, a nickname, or a colorful
suit: Spider-Man IS Peter Parker, in a way

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.940
few superheroes could ever touch. As comic
book blockbusters become more and more common,

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.480
a movie that packs this much punch could help
remind audiences why Spidey truly is one of

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.049
a kind.

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:03.049
Agent Venom

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:08.180
It�s hard to believe that after FIVE Spider-Man
films, Venom has appeared just ONCE. It�s

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.129
only a matter of time until the fan-favorite
villain makes a return to film, and when he

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:22.290
does, the classic Eddie Brock version may
not be the way to go. Although Eugene �Flash�

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.989
Thompson may be famous as a high school jock,
the comics saw Flash grow to admire the superheroics

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.260
of Spider-Man, following his example and enlisting
in the US Army.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.599
Flash went on to prove his own heroism in
combat � losing both of his legs as a result.

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:40.790
Yet, Flash�s bravery makes him a top candidate
for the Army�s �Venom� program. Courtesy

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.280
of a far tamer version of the alien symbiote,
Flash is given new legs and molded into a

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.220
web-slinging supersoldier known as �Agent
Venom�. As fun as it may be to see Spidey

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.639
fight Venom on the big screen, a smarter,
well-meaning version who fights alongside

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:58.870
Spider-Man is simply too good to pass up.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:59.870
Carnage

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.469
What do you get when you cross an even darker
version of Venom, and Batman�s arch-nemesis,

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:10.290
The Joker? The answer is simple: Carnage.
When Eddie Brock found himself in prison for

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.010
his crazed antics, the Venom symbiote arrived
to bust him out � leaving behind its twisted

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.790
offspring. The symbiote spawn soon bonded
to Eddie�s cellmate, serial killer Cletus

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.790
Kasady, creating a certified, superhuman nightmare.

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.670
Over the years, Carnage proved unbalanced
and bloodthirsty enough to take on the forces

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:33.550
of the X-Men, Avengers, Spider-Man, and of
course, Venom himself. Only a villain this

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.100
murderous could force Peter Parker and Eddie
Brock into a shaky truce, but the feud between

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.110
Carnage and Venom in particular became the
stuff of legend. If a new movie universe is

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.020
in need of a villain big enough to challenge
Spider-Man, Venom, and any other hero who

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.500
joins the fight, simply call on Carnage, and
fans will line up for ringside seats.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.920
