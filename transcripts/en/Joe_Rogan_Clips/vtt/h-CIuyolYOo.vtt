00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.980
The Joe Rogan experience travel a mayor.
It's,

2
00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.970
it's also weird like what we'll accept people dying from like a,

3
00:00:08.971 --> 00:00:12.870
I was listening to this podcast where a,
this wolf lady,

4
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.230
she's a wolf biologist who was talking to my friend Steve Rinella on the

5
00:00:16.231 --> 00:00:21.231
mediator podcast and she was talking about how we accept people getting killed

6
00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:25.950
by mountain lions.
Yeah.
It happens.
It happened twice last year.
Right.

7
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.120
It happens.
It's not,
it's not really common,
but it happens.

8
00:00:30.121 --> 00:00:32.640
But the moment that people start getting killed by wolves in America,

9
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.730
people are going to get furious.
Really?
Yeah.

10
00:00:35.731 --> 00:00:40.680
Cause when they reintroduced wolves all the 1994 that's right.
Also that,

11
00:00:40.681 --> 00:00:44.490
so that's a,
they're outraged that we did that too.
Yeah.

12
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.410
Well she was basically,
they were saying it was,

13
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.510
there was two really interesting things about the podcast,

14
00:00:48.511 --> 00:00:49.860
have a lot of really interesting things,

15
00:00:49.861 --> 00:00:54.600
but two that really stood out was one that the,
these people,

16
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.740
they reintroduced these animals in 1994 but there were already some wolves here.

17
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.750
Yeah.
And the wolves would have probably eventually made it down there.
Listen,

18
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.590
Yellowstone,
right?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

19
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.770
But that we aren't w because the fact that they brought him in and it wasn't

20
00:01:10.441 --> 00:01:14.640
just a natural fixture.
We have this thing like,
oh,
so many ruined this.

21
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.310
Somebody fucked this up.
Yeah.

22
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.890
The other thing is that they number them instead of name them,

23
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.280
because if you name them,
it's like there's Dolores odd,

24
00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:24.240
Dolores killed some sheep.

25
00:01:24.241 --> 00:01:27.330
We're going to have to take her out and we can't kill that.
Doris.

26
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.310
Number three wolf one five seven,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah,
that's true.

27
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.010
That's like inmates in prison and just give them numbers.
Exactly.

28
00:01:35.011 --> 00:01:38.820
It's easier to kill him.
Easier to treat them like cattle.
Right.
So,

29
00:01:38.821 --> 00:01:43.230
but we did the one guy killed that mountain lion.
They fought back.
Yeah.

30
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.140
That story turned out to be horseshit.
Oh,
is that right?
Yeah.

31
00:01:46.141 --> 00:01:49.270
That the mountain lion was a kid.

32
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.990
It was a real kitten and had been separated from its mom.

33
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.850
The thing his mom got killed and it was really,
really small and really young,

34
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.890
so it wasn't like,
I mean he might attack,
who knows?
[inaudible] yeah.

35
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.040
Well he's still got a chance.
Yeah,
he's a bitch.
I don't know.

36
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.090
I'm just curious if he's listening right now.
I'm sorry bro.

37
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.340
But I think what happened,
you're alive and we're happy alive.

38
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.620
You better not touch wolves buddy.

39
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.830
I think it maybe was starving to death and it took a chance to try to kill him.

40
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.530
Yeah,
that's possible too.
But it was really small.
It's like 30 pounds,

41
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.200
which is still a 30 pound cat.
It's fucking terrifying.

42
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.100
I never saw pictures of the cat.
The one,
no,

43
00:02:25.101 --> 00:02:27.300
I never saw it either because feel something at eight.

44
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.290
A lot of it by the time we'll,
okay.
Yeah.
So did he say how he did it?

45
00:02:31.291 --> 00:02:35.350
Did he put it in like a choke hold or did he,
did he choked it?
Oh,

46
00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.030
I stepped on it.
Something like that.
Oh Man.
Yeah.

47
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.140
I gonna ask if you saw this thing going around the Internet about this wolf pack

48
00:02:43.141 --> 00:02:45.060
being tracked or there's actually six of my shit.

49
00:02:45.061 --> 00:02:49.680
It's like a moving gif over time,
but oh yeah.
I have seen this.
It's amazing.

50
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.360
It shows how they never crossed territory's.
Oh,
cool.
Six different packs,
I think.

51
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.200
Yeah.
If they all established their territory,
the market territory,

52
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.110
and they respect our respect it.
Yeah.
That's like over Minnesota.

53
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.720
Minnesota has a shitload of woes apparently.

54
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.680
If it keeps going and it's a picture of Jimi Hendrix.
Wisconsin has a shit,
right?

55
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.840
If you pull back further.
Yeah.

56
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.560
Wisconsin is a shitload of wolves apparently like thousands.

57
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.010
Got It.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I could see that.
And it's a lot of,
you know,

58
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.820
the woods up there and just land.
Not,
not many major cities.

59
00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.320
Milwaukee once,
I think I saw a wolf ones,
but it was,
you mean like in the wild?

60
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.060
Yeah,
it was big.
It was easy.
Either a coyote or was a wolf with,

61
00:03:34.061 --> 00:03:38.170
I think that might've been a wolf because it was a just getting dusk and I was

62
00:03:38.171 --> 00:03:42.220
in Alberta and I saw this thing run across the road.
I was like,
damn,

63
00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:45.340
might have been a wolf.
Yeah.
But if you see a wolf,

64
00:03:45.341 --> 00:03:47.870
that's the spooky thing is what are they doing?
They circling you,

65
00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.000
checking you out.
And they're not usually a long right,

66
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.300
but those are the lone wolf.
But that's rare.
That's an asshole.

67
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.540
[inaudible] kicked out.
You ever seen this video?
This one's great.
No,

68
00:03:58.541 --> 00:04:02.680
look at the size of this thing.
Comes out of the woods,
walks across the street.

69
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.700
Look at this.
This mother says,
oh that's a layer.

70
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.300
That's such a big wolf.
That's a bear.
No,

71
00:04:10.301 --> 00:04:13.960
that's a wonder what the point is that it's a big ass wolf.
That's what that is.

72
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.040
That's probably 130 pound wolf or something.
Where is this?

73
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.020
If I had a guest can Russia.
Russia.
Yeah.
It's gotta be Russia.

74
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.450
That's a gigantic wolf.

75
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.400
Russia's had real legitimate problems with wolves were inside Bierria.

76
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.720
They have these super pacs.
They would get together like,

77
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.670
cause they were starving.

78
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.050
So you get like a hundred walls would form a super pac cause they could kind of

79
00:04:38.051 --> 00:04:40.330
do whatever the fuck they wanted once I get that bag.
Yeah.

80
00:04:40.331 --> 00:04:43.460
And they started killing horses.
Yeah.
Go on a horse stables to just,

81
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.260
it's a bunch of water ticked down a horse.
Easy.
Yeah.

82
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.380
But it's just the idea that the super pacs,

83
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.090
they realized it was too hard to,
to just take over shit.

84
00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.400
All these pesky people in their guns at houses sort of got does fucking horses

85
00:05:01.241 --> 00:05:01.540
now.
