00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.769
For this project, I’m going to show you
how to eliminate the fear and panic of losing

00:00:03.769 --> 00:00:07.750
your car keys, and the frustration of getting
locked out by your kids. Especially when your

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.370
keys, are locked inside with them.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.860
Let’s start this project with a 45 lb. karabiner
hook magnet, and a bottle of kids vitamin

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.609
gummies. Save the gummies for your kids because
all we’re really after here is the plastic

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:23.099
container, and the reason I chose this bottle,
is because it’s fairly cheap, and the mouth

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.429
is wide enough for a key fob, to slide in
and out without any problems at all.

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:30.529
Now rather than making our own magnetic key
box, you might be wondering, “Why not just

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.590
go to the store and buy a pre-made case instead?”.
The answer is that you could, but they aren’t

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.950
big enough to store transponders and key fobs,
so they won’t work very well with newer vehicles.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.860
The magnets aren’t impressively strong either.
I tested the store bought version on a flat

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.700
steel weight and found that the most it could
handle was 5 lbs … barely.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.380
One the other hand, you can find super magnets
at the hardware store, that claim to hold up to 45lbs.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.860
Now in practice, I found the most they’re
really good for is about 25 lbs. which is

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.730
nearly half of what’s advertised. But despite
the inflated claim, you can still see they’re

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.540
still at least 5 times stronger, and that
will make all the difference.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.400
Now to make a car hero key box, we’ll need
our magnet secured firmly to the lid of the

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.120
bottle, and I found the easiest way to do
that is with a flat-head screwdriver and a

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.920
propane torch. Of course if you don’t have
a propane torch, you can always use a bbq igniter instead.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.790
Get your screwdriver and carefully heat the
tip for a few seconds in the open flame so

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.330
it gets good and hot, then quickly press it
into the top of the lid so it makes a hole

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.660
that’s slightly offset from the center.
While it’s still hot, make another hole

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.250
in-line with the first, and you should end
up with a nice clean slit right down the center.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.600
Now, when your screwdriver’s cooled down
a bit, gently pry at the edges of the bottle

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.210
cap liner, and pop it out so you can modify
the underside of the cap.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.320
Heat the screwdriver again, but this time,
rather than poking all the way through the

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.920
cap, carefully carve a channel out of the
inner plastic lining, around half an inch

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.670
long on either side of the slit. Take your
time and do a good job, because it’s really

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.310
important that you don’t burn into the yellow
part of the cap underneath.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.560
With this little channel carved out, go ahead
and unhook the karabiner from the magnetic

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.870
base, so you can flip it over and press karabiner
clip down into the cap, locking it into place

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.280
with the magnetic side facing up.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.280
Now if you look closely at the underside of
the cap, it should start to make sense how

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.229
this is going to come together.

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.530
Try hooking the karabiner back in place, and
you’ll most likely find there’s just barely

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.890
enough clearance to get it lined up with the
hole. But with a little persistence, and some

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.640
leverage from your screwdriver, you should
be able to pull it all the way through. It’s

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.530
locked together pretty tight now, and that’s
really great, because it means there’s very

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.569
little chance it’s ever going to come off
by accident.

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.790
At this point, you’re pretty much done,
so go ahead and clip a spare set of keys onto

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.110
the karabiner, and that’s it.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.230
You’ve got yourself a super strong, and
weather resistant, car hero key box. That’ll

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.410
accommodate an emergency set of keys, with
room to spare.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.670
Now let’s go one step further and give it
a paint job.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.260
I thought it would be fun to try coating it
with some abrasion resistant truck bed coating.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.270
This stuff is normally used for lining truck
beds, but you can see it gives the bottle

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.010
a cool textured look, that will help camouflage
it a bit, so it blends in better with where

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.750
we’re going to hide it in a second.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.010
Spray a couple of coatings on the cap as well,
because it’ll help seal the gaps around

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.599
the magnet, and make the whole thing water
resistant.

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.230
Now since your vehicle is built on a steel
frame, your super strong key box will stick

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.459
just about anywhere you want. And if you look
around for awhile you’ll see hundreds of

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.650
little nooks and crannies where you could
hide it, so pick a place that works best for

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.290
you, and your piece of mind.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.360
Now the next time you walk out to your car
and realize your keys are missing, you don’t

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.950
have to worry about calling a friend for a
ride, or breaking a window to get in.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.760
Instead, simply reach for your emergency key
box, and a clean set of spare keys,will be

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.690
waiting there, ready to help you out.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.099
Just like that you’ve dodged a potentially
embarrassing situation, and emerged a car

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:27.120
hero instead. Saving you time, money, and maybe even your pride as well.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.550
Well now you know how to convert a magnet
and plastic bottle into a car hero key box.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.129
That’s over 5 times stronger than store
bought brands, and much more convenient to use.

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.250
By the way, try throwing a few hand wipes
in there as well. This way if you get a bit

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.110
dirty in the process, you’ll have something
handy, to wipe yourself clean.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.250
That’s it for now. If you like this video,
perhaps you’ll like some of my others.
