00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:04.440
Over a lifetime

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.660
all of us change to an extraordinary degree.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.660
From a physical perspective

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.980
we start off as a little bundle about 50 centimeters high,

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.900
with cherubic features and elastic soft skin,

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.940
and then we may end up, some 90 years later,

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.720
as a stooped, gray, liver-spotted, 180-centimeter high structure.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.400
In the intervening period every single cell in our body will have been replaced,

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:33.060
often many times over, and we'll have gone
through all kinds of experiences that

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.920
perhaps leave almost no trace in memory.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.520
The twenty five-year-old won't remember most
of what the five-year-old felt so strongly about.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.180
The sixty seven-year-old will only dimly recall
what was on their mind as they approached 30.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.500
We carry the same name throughout our lives, and

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.250
consider ourselves as a relatively
stable unitary entity, but is it really

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.900
right to think of ourselves as the same person?

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:04.720
Once one puts it under a philosophical microscope the issue of personal identity emerges as far

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.100
trickier than at first assumed.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.480
So, in what ways could we be said to be
continuous throughout time?

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.700
What does guarantee that we can plausibly think of ourselves as the same people over a lifetime?

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.680
Just where is personal identity located?

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.280
A standard assumption is that
it's our body that guarantees our personal identity.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.820
This is the theory that a key part of
what makes me 'me' is that I'm housed in

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.659
an identical body, but philosophers like
to push this assumption around a little.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.940
Imagine if I lost all my hair.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.760
Would I still be me?
Yes, sure.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.020
What if I lost a finger? Yes!
A leg? Definitely.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.660
Now, what if a malevolent demon appeared, and told us
that we'd have to lose every part of our bodies,

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.027
but could keep just one bit...

00:01:56.027 --> 00:01:57.660
Which bit would it be?

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.520
Few of us would pick our elbow, or belly button.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.360
Almost all of us would pick our brains,
and that tells us something interesting.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:13.160
We assume, implicitly, that some bits of our bodies
are more 'me'ish, closer to the core of personal

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.820
identity than others, and the most 'me'ish
of all the bits are our brains.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.500
Christianity runs a version of this thought experiment;
it asks us to think what will happen after our death,

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.700
and it imagines a separation of
the body, ultimately not that significant,

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.380
and the ongoing survival of a more modest,
precious bit that it calls the soul.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.800
There's another version of this thought experiment
that two lovers can play.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.020
In the early throes of love, two people 
who've gone to bed together might ask:

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.420
"What do you really like about me?"

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.740
The wrong answer is to say: "your fabulous
breasts" or "your amazing muscular arms".

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.500
Breasts and chest don't ultimately feel 'me'ish
enough to be a respectable answer.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.940
It seems we want to be loved for something closer to our real self.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.120
Perhaps our soul, or our brain.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.440
Now let's push the thought experiment further:

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.900
What bit of the brain is 
actually most crucial to being 'me'?

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.920
Let's imagine that I have a bump to the head
and lose my ability to play table tennis.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.860
Am I still myself? 
Most of us would say "yes, sure."

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.920
What if I once spoke Latin and lose the ability,

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.500
or forgot how to cook asparagus
with a light mayonnaise sauce.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.660
Would I still be me?

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.560
Yes.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.620
In other words, technical capacities
don't feel very close to the core of personal identity.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.307
What about other kinds of memories?

00:03:38.307 --> 00:03:43.540
A big part of making me 'me'
 tends to be my store of memories.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:49.060
I remember the carpet in my bedroom when I was growing up, or the girl I was in love with at University,

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.480
or the weather over Sydney as we came 
in to land for my first Australian book tour.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.820
But what if these memories all vanished as well?

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.316
Could I still be me?

00:03:59.316 --> 00:04:01.100
One view is: Possibly.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.760
So long as something else remained,
and that thing we can call my character.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.460
In other words, if my characteristic 
way of responding to situations,

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.060
my sense of what is funny, wise, interesting or
important remained the same,

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.300
I can still, in some fundamental way, 
claim to be the same person.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:29.280
My memory store of feelings and behaviors might be gone, but I could be assured of continuing to feel and

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.140
behave in compatible ways in the future.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.180
Those around me would need to keep
reminding me of stuff that had happened,

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.460
but they would still recognize me as me.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.260
A fascinating idea comes into view:

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.560
Personal identity seems to consist not in bodily survival;

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.020
I could be put in somebody else's body,
or live in a jar and still be me.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.360
Nor in the survival of memory;
I could forget everything and still be me.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.680
But in the survival of what
 we are here going to call 'character'.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.580
This is an idea attributed to the English
philosopher John Locke, who famously wrote:

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.600
"Personal identity is made up of",
what he called, "sameness of consciousness".

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.860
If a demon offered us a choice between remembering everything but feeling and valuing very differently,

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.280
or feeling and valuing the same sorts of things
but remembering nothing,

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.540
most of us would, Locke suggests, choose the latter.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.300
So, if we have to boil
personal identity down to its essence

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.120
it seems to come down to
values, inclinations, and temperament.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.820
Let's think of death with all this in mind.

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:44.480
The standard view of death is that it's sad
because it means the end of our identity.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.908
Now, it certainly does mean the end if we identify identity with the survival of our bodies,

00:05:49.908 --> 00:05:51.920
or with that of our memories.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.140
But if we think that who we are is to a
large degree about our values, and

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:02.830
characteristic loves and hates, then we are,
in a sense, granted a kind of immortality

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.840
simply through the fact that these will
continue to live on in our species, as a whole,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.840
lodged here and there, 
outside of their present home.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:18.740
Perhaps what we have learned to call 'me'
was only ever a temporary resting place for a set of

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:25.060
ideas and proclivities that are far older,
and are destined to live on far longer than our bodies...

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.600
We might attempt to be less
sad about death by letting go

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:33.500
of the idea that we are a particular
constellation of physical features.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:38.360
We are always, in a sense, far longer
lasting, far more transgenerational

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.920
as a bundle of inclinations, and ideas.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.820
We will continue to crop up and live
wherever those ideas,

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.580
that are most characteristic
of us will emerge, as they must,

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.120
in the generations that are to come.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:00.100
Focusing in on questions of identity has
the paradoxical, and rather cheering effect

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:05.080
of making us both less attached
to certain bits of us, and more confident

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.780
that the really important things about
who we have been will survive, in a way,

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:15.880
long after our bodies have returned to dust
and our memories have been obliterated.
