00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
For this question, I'm going to introduce a new mode of operation,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
which is very similar to cipher feedback mode.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This is the way cipher feedback mode worked.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The change for output feedback mode

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
is instead of taking the cipher text

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and putting that back into the x vector,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
we're going to take the output from the encryption

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and take that, so that's the only difference between

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
cipher feedback mode and output feedback mode.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Which of the following are true?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Output feedback mode provides stronger protection against tampering

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
than is possible with CFB.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Unlike CFB, with OFB it's possible to recover most of an encrypted file,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
even if one of the blocks in the encrypted file is lost.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Like CFB, it could be the basis of  a cryptographic hash function using OFB.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And finally, it would be safe to use 0 as the initialization vector for OFB.

00:00:52.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Which of the following 4 statements are true?
