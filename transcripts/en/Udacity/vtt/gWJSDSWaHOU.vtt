00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.830
In the previous lessons of this mini-course,

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.620
we discussed high level design, or architecture,

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.380
low level design, and design patterns. Now, we're going to see how we can put

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.380
this and also others software engineering activities

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.436
together in the context of a UML-based

00:00:18.436 --> 00:00:21.820
process model, the unified software process, or

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.580
USP. We will discuss how USP was defined,

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.492
its main characteristics, its phases, and how we can apply it in practice.
