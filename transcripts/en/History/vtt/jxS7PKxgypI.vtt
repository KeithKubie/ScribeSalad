00:00:01.418 --> 00:00:03.753
NARRATOR: The government

00:00:03.753 --> 00:00:07.841
They've spent the last 40 years
fighting to get them back.

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:11.344
From 1976 to 1983,
Argentina fell

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:13.930
under a military dictatorship.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.849
During this time,
government death squads

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.644
hunted down anyone suspected
of political dissidence.

00:00:19.644 --> 00:00:23.606
Up to 30,000 people disappeared.

00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:25.900
Among them were pregnant women.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.819
The mothers were kept
alive until giving

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:31.740
birth, after they were killed.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.908
Their orphaned newborns
were given to couples

00:00:33.908 --> 00:00:36.369
who supported the government.

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:39.122
It is estimated that 500
newborns were kidnapped

00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:41.708
in this way, but the
grandmothers of the lost

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:44.252
children refused to give up.

00:00:44.252 --> 00:00:47.547
Mothers and grandmothers of the
disappeared banded together--

00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:49.174
boldly standing up
to the government

00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:51.968
by marching in silent
protest every Thursday

00:00:51.968 --> 00:00:53.678
around the Plaza de Mayo--

00:00:53.678 --> 00:00:57.390
earning the title
Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.352
After the regime fell in
1983, they began their search.

00:01:01.352 --> 00:01:04.272
The grandmothers became
their own detectives.

00:01:04.272 --> 00:01:08.067
By 1987, they had found
39 of the lost children,

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:11.029
but hundreds were still missing.

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:15.158
So they turned to an emerging
science in mitochondrial DNA,

00:01:15.158 --> 00:01:17.577
which could match individual
children with women who might

00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:19.746
be their maternal grandmothers.

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:22.499
But they still needed
samples from the taken.

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:25.168
So, in 1997, they
invited anyone who

00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:28.546
was uncertain about their
identity to come forward.

00:01:28.546 --> 00:01:29.881
Many did.

00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:31.508
Helping bring the
number of lost children

00:01:31.508 --> 00:01:33.051
found to more than 120.

00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:35.261
[music playing]

00:01:37.722 --> 00:01:40.558
[speaking spanish]

00:01:40.558 --> 00:01:44.479
The abuelas are now a recognized
human rights organization.

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.565
They have received multiple
nominations for the Nobel Peace

00:01:47.565 --> 00:01:50.276
Prize, and remain
dedicated to rebuilding

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:53.571
families and restoring
justice until all the lost

00:01:53.571 --> 00:01:54.280
have been found.

00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:02.580
WOMAN: March on, celebrating
women who changed the world.
