Vsauce!

00:00:01.179 --> 00:00:02.380
Kevin here, with…

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.540
100 pieces of paper.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.390
And I’ll teach you how to hire the right
plumber, choose the best parking space, and

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:14.760
even find the love of your life... by quitting.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.860
Real quick, this video is actually sponsored
by LastPass.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.910
I genuinely use LastPass every single day.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.860
I signed up a year ago because I was seriously
tired of forgetting passwords, getting locked

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.070
out of accounts, and even dealing with websites
having different rules about what the password

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.070
can be.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.290
So I decided to just put everything in LastPass
and just make my life that much easier.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.650
Here’s how it works.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.750
It stores everything safely and securely for
you and then autofills your usernames and

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.570
passwords everywhere.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.370
With unlimited password storage and cross-device
sync.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.219
So if you wanna eliminate your password frustrations
forever just click the link down in the description

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:55.879
below.

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.950
And thanks again to them for supporting Vsauce2.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.040
Okay.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.149
Back to our papers.

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.940
Each of these 100 slips of paper has a number
on it.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:11.720
The numbers can be anywhere from 1 to a Googol
-- which is 1 followed by 100 zeroes.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.110
The Game of Googol is to turn them over one
by one and stop when you think that you’ve

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.650
got the highest number.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.700
Here’s the important part.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.659
Your final flipped paper is your choice.

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.140
You can’t, like, flip five papers over and
then retroactively choose the second paper

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.479
because it had the biggest number.

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.409
No, no, no.

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:37.170
That’s against the rules.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.180
So the trick to winning The Game Of Googol
is knowing when to stop.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.950
Alright, let’s play.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.710
Paper number one.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:46.710
100,028.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.520
Ok, that’s a pretty big number, but it’s
not even close to a Googol.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.439
It can’t possibly be the highest number
out of all of these.

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:57.790
So let’s flip another.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:04.939
94 trillion, 288 billion, 381 million, 109
thousand 276.

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.659
That’s huge.

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.389
But it’s far from a Googol, so I should
probably keep going.

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:13.659
I think?

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:17.559
Honestly, I don’t know.

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:22.120
How am I supposed to choose the highest numbered
slip when I don’t even know what the numbers

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.120
are?

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.620
The lowest number could be…

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.819
7, or 10,000.

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.330
The highest number could be... well, anything
up to or including a Googol.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.879
So, the odds of me picking the highest number
are what, like 1% or something?

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:39.879
No.

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:47.129
The odds of me choosing correctly are actually
about 1 in 3 -- because I’m going to employ

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:53.079
Optimal Stopping Theory, the branch of mathematics
that deals with knowing when to quit.

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:57.760
That way you get the highest reward or the
lowest cost.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.260
The Game of Googol was invented in 1958 and
it didn’t take long for mathematicians to

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.069
figure out an elegant approach.

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.470
The key is… e.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.430
The number e. Uhh.. excuse me, papers.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.079
I gotta talk about some e here.

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:22.230
Euler’s Number is an irrational number that’s
roughly 2.71828, a mathematical constant that

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.980
shows up in exponential growth and even calculating
compound interest.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:34.769
e is one of the most important numbers in
mathematics along with 0, 1, pi, and i -- and

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:40.959
it’s a component of Euler’s Identity,
the gold standard of mathematical beauty.

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.529
And to win The Game of Googol, we need to
flip Euler upside down.

00:03:46.529 --> 00:03:48.099
Not like that.

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:49.099
Like this!

00:03:49.099 --> 00:04:00.010
The reciprocal of Euler’s number -- 1/e,
or 1/2.71828, or… .367879… or approximately

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:06.219
37%, is the lowest our probability of winning
the Game of Googol will ever be as long as

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:08.589
we stick to the optimal strategy.

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:13.169
We don’t need to know the numbers on the
slips and it doesn’t matter if we’re playing

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:17.459
with 10 slips, 100 slips, or… 642 duodecillion
slips.

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.110
We just need to answer one question...

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:29.060
When, exactly, mathematically, do we start
stopping?

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.210
Ok, so I can just go through this solution
to the Game of Googol.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.210
Alright.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.180
Here we go.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.400
Yeah, lookin' good.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.889
Mmm Hmmm.

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:41.889
Yup.

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:43.860
No problems here.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.080
And, forget it.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.590
We’re not gonna do that.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:53.300
We’re gonna do instead is we're gonna use
e and basic optimal stopping theory, to find

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:59.370
a quick, accurate point at which we need to
stop playing to maximize our chance of winning.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.270
Let’s solve The Game of Googol with just
10 slips of paper.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.800
The trick is to take a sample of numbers,
and then decide to commit to the very next

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.030
number we pull that’s larger than any in
that previous sample.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.509
So, with 10 slips total, do we decide to take
the highest number after…what?

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:18.870
The third?

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.210
The 5th?

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.960
It can’t be too late in the game, because
if we wait until, like, slip nine we’ll

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.669
likely have already revealed and passed over
our biggest number.

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:31.310
Let's not guess.

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.909
Let's get Eule-y.

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:43.150
If we divide our number of slips, 10, by e,
we get 3.67889 by rounding up to the next

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.840
integer, we can stop collecting our sample
on the 4th slip.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.500
Then we’ll keep choosing slips and stop
when we find one that’s higher than any

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:58.949
of those first four -- and there’s around
a 1/e chance that we’ll be right.

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:05.009
This works for 10, 100, or 3,781 slips.

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:13.669
Because that’s just 3,781 divided by e,
so 1,390.95 -- we’d choose until we pulled

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:17.930
a number higher than any in the 1,391st slip.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:24.629
We’ll be exactly right about a third of
the time… and when we aren’t, we’d still

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:26.479
be really close.

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:31.400
Look, I’ll mix these up and I'll play a
totally random game using this strategy, and

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.550
we’ll just see what happens.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.030
So there's my sample of four slips.

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:39.639
And now I'll just choose the next number that's
bigger than these four.

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:41.810
Alright, my choice is number six.

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.219
Let's see if that's the highest number here.

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:47.020
Oops.

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.400
So the strategy didn't work.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:53.990
Six wasn't the highest number, it was actually
slip number nine.

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:58.349
A 1 out 3 success rate of this strategy might
not sound impressive.

00:06:58.349 --> 00:07:02.020
You're still going to lose about 2 out of
every 3 times.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:06.180
But imagine how low your success rate would
be if you had no system to help you decide...

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:10.310
and as the number of slips in The Game of
Googol becomes larger, the likelihood that

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:14.499
your uninformed guess is actually right trends
toward zero.

00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:19.310
Thirty-something percent is a lot better than,
say, .003%.

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:26.539
We, as humans, don’t calculate probabilities
with Euler’s number 10 times a day, but

00:07:26.539 --> 00:07:33.370
our brain does seem to have a general heuristic
-- a series of mental shortcuts and basic

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:37.610
rules -- that helps us decide when to stop.

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:42.139
Researchers at the Laboratory of Neuropsychology
at the National Institute of Mental Health

00:07:42.139 --> 00:07:47.300
ran fMRI scans on brains that were trying
to decide whether to keep searching for the

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:53.759
best choice or commit to the current option…
and they found that several parts of the brain

00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:58.370
light up when faced with an optimal stopping
problem.

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:04.960
Euler’s number and optimal stopping theory
is how, in a sea of possibilities, you decide,

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:10.580
“this is the best parking spot I’m gonna
find,” or, “this is the house that I’m

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:16.189
gonna buy,” or, “this is the YouTube video
I’m gonna watch.”

00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:22.080
Without even realizing it, you played The
Game of Googol in your brain to watch this

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.940
video about The Game of Googol.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:30.860
You didn’t scroll through every single video
on YouTube and go back to determine that this

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:32.789
was the one to click on.

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:37.630
You scanned some options, clicked me, and
here we are.

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:43.659
You’re Johannes Kepler and I’m bachelorette
number five.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:49.779
In 1611, Kepler interviewed eleven women in
the hopes of finding a wife.

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:52.550
He passed on eleven women.

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:55.690
Kepler was left alone.

00:08:55.690 --> 00:09:00.410
He rejected all of his options and thought
he'd missed his chance.

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:06.710
Luckily, he went back to bachelorette number
5, she said yes, and they lived happily ever

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:07.710
after.

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:12.180
Kepler found the love of his life, but he
did it the hard way.

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:19.529
All he needed to do was divide 11 by e to
get a value around 4, then taken the very

00:09:19.529 --> 00:09:28.310
next option better than those -- which would’ve
been bachelorette number 5, the love of his

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:35.570
life, hidden in plain math all along.

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:40.620
And as always, thanks for watching.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:52.050

I didn't plan this.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:16.509
It's okay.

00:10:16.509 --> 00:10:19.079
That's probably enough.
