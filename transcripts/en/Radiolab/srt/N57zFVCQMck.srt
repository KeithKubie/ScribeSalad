1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,460
You're listening to
radiolab radio from Wny, c.

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:07,913
E. N. N. P. R.

3
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:19,240
[inaudible]. Um, we are
a church in a church. Oh,

4
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,083
that's,

5
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,630
it's not usually where we start.
We're in a church cathedral. Really?

6
00:00:24,631 --> 00:00:27,540
A huge cathedral in Upper
Manhattan. Saint John,

7
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:29,910
the divine got an Oregon.

8
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,590
The preacher was preaching

9
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,390
congregation of course. Couple thousand
people in the pews. At least Jesus said,

10
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,840
therefore your basic Sunday service,

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,350
except today, you've also got,

12
00:00:52,351 --> 00:00:54,060
here it comes.

13
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,850
The reason we begin here is because
today the church is filled with dogs.

14
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,790
I talked to you about your dog.
Yeah. What's his or her name?

15
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:06,743
His name is blizzard.

16
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:10,180
He's a Labrador and put Omex. Wow.

17
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:13,960
I have legend who I
just adopted in January.

18
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,520
I have Jen pow

19
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,700
bell by the way. In more than
dogs. You've got birds, Jessie.

20
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:23,120
It's a choir now and now. Has
this guy ever been blessed before?

21
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,170
I don't think so. No. Just
worn this year in hamsters.

22
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:30,560
His name is Toby. Teddy toes.

23
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,550
And if he'd come out you'd see why
because he's really fat and all kinds of

24
00:01:34,551 --> 00:01:39,080
creatures. Got a little girl with a
falcon in behind her. Oh, it's a giant,

25
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,873
horrendous. This is

26
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:46,040
the Saint Francis Day of the animacy
yearly event coming toward us where people

27
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:48,820
bring their animals to be
blessed. Is it daunting?

28
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,900
The folks that are gathered here and
there is a little girl with a hermit crab.

29
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,680
They don't think there's anything
weird or inappropriate about this fact.

30
00:01:57,681 --> 00:01:59,510
If you ask them in here comes up

31
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,450
both, here's what they say. I don't
know if it means anything to her,

32
00:02:02,451 --> 00:02:07,451
but it means a to me cause you know you
want to baptize your babies and this is

33
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:11,460
more or less the same kind of thing. And
what does it, what does it mean to you?

34
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,230
It just means when, when she finally
does go away, she's gonna go to heaven.

35
00:02:15,231 --> 00:02:18,380
What kind of parent it is?
She called [inaudible].

36
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,620
Don't put your hand near his face if
he wants. When you chuckle, struggle.

37
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,450
Do you feel like he has a, a soul
or an inner life of some sort?

38
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,700
It's a thinking being there. They're as
smart as we are. Really? Andrew? Okay.

39
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:34,080
Yeah. Since you invited me here. I
didn't want to be impolite or anything.

40
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,200
Say what you gotta say. Well,
okay. These people of course,

41
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:40,560
they love their animals.
Sure. Yeah. Can you hear that?

42
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:45,770
Because when I'm feeling sad comes in
the bed and he lays down spine to spine

43
00:02:46,141 --> 00:02:51,130
with me and he just didn't leave
my side. The using a little bit.

44
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:56,310
The animals they love are going to feel
like grace of the prayer or feels the

45
00:02:57,881 --> 00:03:00,190
blessing, which is a one which raises

46
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,023
a question.

47
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:06,930
What do we really know about what
goes on inside the animal's mind?

48
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:11,140
Yeah. All those things that you might
feel in a church. Grace, gratitude, uh,

49
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,970
guilt. Can the animals
feel those things too?

50
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,930
How much can we share and
can you measure it? Yeah.

51
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,340
I'm Jad Abumrad I am Robert
Krulwich. This is radio

52
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,073
[inaudible]

53
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,670
and we will begin the hour with a
story about an animal who would,

54
00:03:40,671 --> 00:03:42,920
I'm sure love to have been at
the worship service, but it was,

55
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,550
it was a very inconvenient thing.
Didn't get eaten quite get there.

56
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,460
[inaudible]

57
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,480
okay. Just to get things rolling.

58
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:55,770
This is a story that we
heard about [inaudible] who
went off to talk about first

59
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,110
from the following day. Is
it or is it Mike [inaudible]?

60
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:03,420
There's way too many mics around make
men ago is his name. No here and a,

61
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,180
we met recently at the Emeryville Marina,

62
00:04:06,181 --> 00:04:10,430
which is not far from San Francisco where
he's got a boat called the super fish

63
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,510
mix. Says he rents out for
all kinds of things. Sure.

64
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,010
Trips to ash gathering bachelor
parties, fireworks watching.

65
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,750
I got a little cardboard sign. I stand
by the freeway. Just have boat need work.

66
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,590
So yeah, that's mic. And our story
begins one morning in December,

67
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,300
probably eight o'clock in
the morning or something.

68
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:31,690
As I recall a few years back, Mick just
kind of sitting at home. I was at home.

69
00:04:31,691 --> 00:04:33,520
Yeah, it was the middle of
December. We didn't have any work,

70
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:38,440
but then he gets this call.
Hello, you got this call.

71
00:04:38,441 --> 00:04:42,520
There was the call relaying a message
from a fishermen way out at sea,

72
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,030
18 miles maybe outside
the golden gate bridge.

73
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,810
They told me that there
was a whale in trouble,

74
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,630
tangle up in grabbed gear and it
didn't appear to be able to move.

75
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:58,300
So after he hangs up and make
immediately calls a few dive buddies,

76
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:03,020
Jim Yong, Kim young air force, Para
rescue. And then uh, let's see,

77
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:07,400
James Mosquito, James Mosquito national
diver. I called them and said, hey,

78
00:05:07,401 --> 00:05:10,460
you know, here's the deal. Are you
interested? It was a no brainer. I said,

79
00:05:10,461 --> 00:05:12,800
yeah, I'm in. Absolutely. I
figured, all right, we're going.

80
00:05:12,801 --> 00:05:13,670
I packed up my stuff,

81
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:18,220
grabbed my gear and I went directly
to the boat and we left underneath the

82
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,053
Golden Gate Bridge.

83
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:24,780
Nothing at the horizon in front of
us. My name is Holly [inaudible].

84
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:29,830
I am James's significant tethered.
We motored out for about two hours.

85
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,790
Had to do less towards the means.

86
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,920
What were you feeling when
you're on the boat heading out?

87
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,380
I didn't think we'd find
it. I really didn't.

88
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,610
But about 18 miles off the
coast, completely open water.

89
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,710
One of the divers spots and crab buoys
in the distance and some seagulls flying

90
00:05:48,711 --> 00:05:52,070
overhead. And as they got closer,
[inaudible] saw the whale,

91
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:59,300
just the very top of the whale sticking
up about maybe six inches out of the

92
00:05:59,301 --> 00:06:03,110
water at the surface, a tiny
sliver of black. And that was it.

93
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,380
I said, okay, we needed to
see what's going on. So, uh,

94
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:10,720
so Tim and James Jump into an inflatable
boat and they paddle about a couple of

95
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,210
hundred feet from the way,

96
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,970
and it just wasn't happening. Every
time that the swale came on up,

97
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,650
it would just displace the boat back
again. So it would push us back again.

98
00:06:18,651 --> 00:06:21,500
Not to mention the visibility
in the water was just terrible.

99
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:24,320
He couldn't even see down there to see,
you know, what they were dealing with.

100
00:06:24,321 --> 00:06:28,850
And uh, you know what, sometimes plans
have to change in, in mid flight.

101
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:32,310
So Tim and James Look at each other
and without saying a word boom,

102
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,950
we got out of the boat and slash

103
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,713
until the water

104
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,760
and I see a shadow

105
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,400
[inaudible] massive
animal, a hazy silhouette.

106
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,870
And we just started swimming

107
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:55,710
[inaudible]

108
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:58,590
to the whale about a hundred feet away.

109
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:04,210
You know, parts of have blubber
and skin floating around 35 feet,

110
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,810
20 feet, and then they see it.

111
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,870
My goodness, this thing's
the size of a school bus.

112
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:18,480
A female humpback whale is one of
the largest creatures on the planet,

113
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,290
50 feet long, 50 tons,

114
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:26,480
and this particular whale was in a kind
of c shape where its head was at the top

115
00:07:26,481 --> 00:07:29,540
of the water, but its tail was
almost pointed directly down.

116
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:33,980
It was almost like somebody was pulling
her down by the tail to the bottom of

117
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:34,680
the ocean.

118
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,280
Yeah, there was probably 20 crab traps,

119
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:41,510
2000 pounds at least
just tied up to the tail.

120
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:45,980
She had just become an anchor and to see
her not be able to move that tail and a

121
00:07:45,981 --> 00:07:46,820
struggle, just like

122
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:53,870
the will was actually really laboring
to breathe a little puff and there was

123
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:56,674
just a rope

124
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:00,000
everywhere. It went
around the whale's mouth,

125
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:03,510
around the whales head across her
eye, over her background, the pickup

126
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,590
Toro fins all way down to his
tail. I thought there was no hope,

127
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,520
there was no chance.

128
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,790
We're looking at a dead well and
the whale just doesn't know it yet.

129
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:18,330
But I knew that I had to try win a swim
to the whale and as soon as I decided,

130
00:08:19,121 --> 00:08:20,170
okay, I'm going to swim to the whale.

131
00:08:20,171 --> 00:08:23,920
Well the whale decided she wasn't
going to have that. What you do,

132
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,780
she put up her pictorial fin,

133
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:30,400
which is like her arm and this
pictorial fins about 15 feet long.

134
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:33,610
It's about four feet wide. And she just

135
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,670
splashing down the water in front of me.

136
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,050
This is the size of an airplane
wing coming down on top of you,

137
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:45,910
just inches from my head. So yeah,

138
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,820
at that point I backed off and uh,

139
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:52,020
waited, waited for the
whale to settle down.

140
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,350
She was physically exhausted, which did,

141
00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:00,720
and then they both swim back.
James goes to the tail and Tim,

142
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,320
up to the wheels head, you know, I was
there with a a six inch dive knife,

143
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:08,760
cutting out line right near her eye,
which was the size of a grapefruit.

144
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:10,560
[inaudible]

145
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,510
hinge her, I was moving,
keeping an eye on me.

146
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,530
Really. Absolutely. He would
go left or I would go left.

147
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:23,330
He'd go right or I would go right.
She was tracking me and all the wild.

148
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,210
They're just cutting as
much rope as they can.

149
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,490
You really had a saw at it. It
was very strong, very tight.

150
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:34,350
Sometimes I'd cut a rope and it would
be a loose rope and all of a sudden

151
00:09:34,351 --> 00:09:35,400
something else would tighten up,

152
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:41,640
which was a one rope that would let it
all free. This whole process took hours,

153
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,570
but finally James gets to the end of ace
at the tail sign his way through that

154
00:09:47,571 --> 00:09:52,010
big clump of line and he realizes at a
certain point it to cut through all that

155
00:09:52,011 --> 00:09:52,450
line.

156
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:56,900
I'm going have to stab the whale to
get my knife underneath the rope. Ah,

157
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,590
it was that tight though.

158
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,750
I a jagged my knife into the whale's
tail and pull the rope and then cut it

159
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,270
and it wants the rope went

160
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,710
[inaudible].

161
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:13,710
It was a very surreal moment looking down
and seeing the 20 crab traps and buoys

162
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,630
just disappear into the abyss.

163
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:26,920
[inaudible] [inaudible]

164
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,470
and just like that the whale was gone.

165
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,760
I'm spinning around going, where
did she go? Where did she go?

166
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:38,470
But as the water settled, they realized
they'd done it. They'd freed her.

167
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,580
As soon as they came up, I was like,
Woo. Oh. Cooping it up and yelling.

168
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,070
Unbelievable. I was

169
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:44,991
screaming,

170
00:10:44,991 --> 00:10:49,280
can you imagine now here's where the
story takes a pretty startling turn.

171
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:49,970
In fact,

172
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:53,180
the whole reason we wanted to tell this
story to begin with is for what happens

173
00:10:53,181 --> 00:10:56,600
next. So Tim and James and the other day
was her in the water there celebrating,

174
00:10:56,601 --> 00:11:00,890
high fiving and then all of
a sudden James looks down.

175
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:05,810
Next thing I know I have this
50 ton whale coming right at me.

176
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,300
I'm thinking, oh my God,
stop. I just stayed. Wait,

177
00:11:10,301 --> 00:11:13,300
so this whale is coming at you
from below like jaws? Yeah,

178
00:11:13,301 --> 00:11:17,680
she's rising up towards me. Oh God. I
was just thinking this is going to hurt

179
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:22,700
and like she was only
inches away from my chest.

180
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,660
[inaudible]

181
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,493
stopped

182
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,343
and

183
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,290
push me on the chest backwards

184
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,940
and then released me and
then kind of pushed again

185
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,460
and then release and pushed again

186
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,450
and again. Wow.

187
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,650
And then she swam up right next to me,

188
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,160
picks her head up the water so that her
eye was above the water and then came up

189
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,100
and looked directly at me

190
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:01,500
[inaudible]

191
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,390
and for what felt like 30 seconds.

192
00:12:03,391 --> 00:12:07,200
He says she just stared at him.

193
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:10,650
People didn't move around. She
wasn't looking for anything else.

194
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:11,920
She was just looking

195
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:13,430
at me.

196
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:17,810
Mm,

197
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:22,770
you're in the presence of something
that great, makes you feel small.

198
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,660
It really wasn't a very
emotional feeling, you know,

199
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:30,270
wasn't quite sure what to
make out of it, make of it.

200
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:34,410
But then he says she went off to
the next dire, did the same thing.

201
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,610
I remember distinctly how is
18 inches away from her eye.

202
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:43,230
And she just looked at me and let
me touch her and then swam off.

203
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,450
Then she went off to the next
diver and did the same thing.

204
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,560
And the next person did the same thing
one by one coming up right next to him,

205
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:53,130
looking at him really good. And
you'll inches away eyeballing them.

206
00:12:53,131 --> 00:12:55,350
Just swim around to every
diver. All the guys got, yeah.

207
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,720
So it was about desk. Um,
the water was glass flat.

208
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:04,320
I was sitting at the helm of the boat
just in awe and they had to leave the

209
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,600
whale. She didn't want to leave them.

210
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,560
And this is a real question here.

211
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:19,680
What exactly was that wheel doing
or saying? Was she saying anything?

212
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:23,960
If you asked James or Tim or
Mike or any of the other divers,

213
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,700
we're in the water that
day. They'll tell you.

214
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:31,080
I felt this whale was really thanking us.

215
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:35,170
I know it sounds crazy, but I
could see the look in her eye,

216
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,140
this mammal, this,

217
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:41,640
this 50 ton mammal was
literally saying things.

218
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,740
Thanks for helping me
out. And you know, I'll,

219
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:48,890
I'll bring that to my grave knowing
the gratification that I felt

220
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:01,840
[inaudible]

221
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,450
wow. So what do you think we,
here's the question really.

222
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:09,230
Was that whale saying thank
you? Was the whale thing? Well

223
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,950
I think the whale was saying
something. I mean a whale.

224
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,870
If she was just free to have her ups,

225
00:14:14,871 --> 00:14:17,750
I would think she would just
go off and say, well I'm free.

226
00:14:17,751 --> 00:14:19,510
So the fact that she was,

227
00:14:19,511 --> 00:14:24,500
she hung around and make these specific
eyeball visits, like, I don't know.

228
00:14:24,501 --> 00:14:27,220
I feel that she, there's something
intentional about that. She did,

229
00:14:27,221 --> 00:14:30,500
she didn't leave anyone out right now.
She went, in fact, according to them,

230
00:14:30,501 --> 00:14:31,340
one of the guys on the boat,

231
00:14:31,341 --> 00:14:33,860
she actually went to the boats and
did the same thing to the boats.

232
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:36,770
She said thank you to the
boats. Yeah. Hm. Well then,

233
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:40,430
so she was looking at the people,
but she also thought the craft was,

234
00:14:40,431 --> 00:14:42,800
somebody should say that
you or is I deal with, yeah,

235
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:45,620
so maybe she was just
site. Maybe she was just a,

236
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,020
yeah,

237
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,700
I really don't know what I mean. I don't,

238
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,010
I don't feel completely
comfortable just saying,

239
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,530
of course I knew what I
want to feel. Yeah, me too.

240
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,350
But let's just try to
straighten up for a second.

241
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:02,270
We have a guy named Clive when his
teaches at the university. Hello. Hey. Oh,

242
00:15:02,271 --> 00:15:04,820
hi. Is this Mr Clive
when, yeah, this is live.

243
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:08,300
When clover's within the psychology
department of the University of Florida.

244
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:12,160
Where am I taught? Here's this. This
is Jad from a radio 11 right? Hijab.

245
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,050
Clive also happens to be an
expert on animal psychology. Hi,

246
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:18,980
this is Robert also. Can you hear us
pretty well? I can hear you pretty well.

247
00:15:18,981 --> 00:15:22,010
I'm, I'm, I'm wondering how well I'm
going to distinguish your voices.

248
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:27,950
No need to do that just as a unitary
figure. Okay. Listen, let me,

249
00:15:27,951 --> 00:15:29,780
let me begin on this is Robert Talking.

250
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,650
We'll tell you a story and we want
to know what you think of the story.

251
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,270
So once upon a time and not too long ago,

252
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,200
we're going to fast forward a bit cause
we ran Clive through the entire wheel

253
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:43,760
story front to back crystal
to you is if a diver said you,

254
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:46,670
this whale said thank you
to me, what would you say?

255
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:52,170
Well I would be put in a difficult
situation because I don't doubt the,

256
00:15:52,631 --> 00:15:56,980
what these people experienced was a
very moving moment with that whale.

257
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:02,610
But the problem is I just don't speak
whale so I don't know what thank you looks

258
00:16:03,281 --> 00:16:08,050
like in whale. If I'm going to
be a cynic about it, I would say,

259
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:11,980
well, the whale has been
trapped for I believe,

260
00:16:11,981 --> 00:16:14,740
over a day and may just be disoriented.

261
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:15,881
Well, but this was,

262
00:16:15,881 --> 00:16:20,530
this was parking herself with one
individual and then moving to the next.

263
00:16:20,531 --> 00:16:23,730
That's not a distracted. That looks
like it's got some money intention.

264
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:27,420
It shows some interest in the individuals.
I'll give you that, but how do we,

265
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:28,950
how do we get from that too?

266
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:32,490
Did you sing that the whale is trying to
express things? What do you live with?

267
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,690
Let's play a different example.

268
00:16:33,691 --> 00:16:37,440
Let's suppose that you found a bear in
the woods that was caught up in some

269
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:42,210
netting that ended up in the woods and
you work for hours to free the bear and

270
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:43,470
then the bat eats you.

271
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:48,060
Does that mean that the bears are an
ungrateful species of animal? Yes.

272
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,110
No, I don't really believe
it that. Right. Well, so,

273
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:56,730
so I mean it would make as much sense to
ascribe in gratitude to the bear as it

274
00:16:56,731 --> 00:16:59,040
does to ascribe gratitude to the whale.

275
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,070
I just don't think that's a useful
way of trying to understand animals.

276
00:17:02,071 --> 00:17:06,210
And I think it ultimately it demeans
them because it means that instead of

277
00:17:06,211 --> 00:17:09,840
living in a world that's full of a
diversity of wonderful creatures,

278
00:17:09,841 --> 00:17:13,230
each with its own ways of relating to
other members of its own species and other

279
00:17:13,231 --> 00:17:16,440
members of other species, we say, well,
we don't live in a world like that.

280
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:20,280
We live in a world that's basically a
world of human beings. It doesn't matter.

281
00:17:20,281 --> 00:17:24,030
Some of these human beings have suits
on some of these human beings weigh

282
00:17:24,031 --> 00:17:27,480
hundreds of tons of live under the ocean
and can hold their breath for a very

283
00:17:27,481 --> 00:17:30,180
long time. None of that
really matters. Ultimately,

284
00:17:30,181 --> 00:17:33,630
they're all basically like us and
I just don't find that satisfying.

285
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,240
Are you saying that you don't know if
there's a possibility of sharing or that

286
00:17:39,241 --> 00:17:43,410
you don't think that there's a possibility
of sharing at an emotional level

287
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,840
between two species? Um,

288
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:51,150
I don't doubt that there is
the possibility of between
two species. I mean you,

289
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,830
I see it with dogs all the time,

290
00:17:52,831 --> 00:17:56,550
but I think it would be a mistake if we
thought that the love we feel for our

291
00:17:56,551 --> 00:17:59,850
dogs is the same feeling that
the dog has back to us. It,

292
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,600
it has different qualities and it where
you pet your dog wags his tail and it

293
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:06,810
seems happy to see you. Yeah. Do you
just like not trust that well, okay,

294
00:18:06,811 --> 00:18:09,960
so let me make clear that I wear two
hats when I'm talking about a dog,

295
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:11,490
particularly a pet of my own.

296
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,300
I'm where I have two possible hats I can
wear and one is that when the dog pants

297
00:18:15,301 --> 00:18:19,290
back at me, I just hug the dog and you
know, and let him kiss me. And that's,

298
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:22,260
that's life with a dog. But if I'm,

299
00:18:22,261 --> 00:18:26,880
if I'm now wearing my scientific hat and
getting my blanket as wet as I possibly

300
00:18:26,881 --> 00:18:31,580
can, then I ask myself, what do
these behaviors mean among those?

301
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:40,690
That was a beautiful study that came
out recently from Alexander Horevitz.

302
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm Alexandra Horowitz and I study
dog cognition. Where do we find her?

303
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:48,370
She's four. She's around the corner
from you. She's at Barnard College.

304
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:52,840
So we sent our producers, so we're in
wheeler. Yup. That's me to meet her.

305
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,680
And he ended up hanging out with her
and her dog Finnegan in the park and

306
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,260
snuffle that's nice stuff.

307
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:04,240
She did this beautiful
experiment that shows that um,

308
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:07,560
when people think their dog
is looking guilty, ears back,

309
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,450
eyes lowered tail between the legs.

310
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:13,720
Actually the dog is just being submissive.

311
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,670
So here's what she did.

312
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:21,050
She tracked down a bunch of dog owners
posted on craigslist and put out posters.

313
00:19:21,051 --> 00:19:25,130
And then she found a bunch of owners who
believed that like most dog owners do

314
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:26,780
that their dogs feel guilty. Yes,

315
00:19:26,781 --> 00:19:28,730
my dog feels guilty when
he's done something wrong.

316
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,120
And then she set up a situation where
all of the dog owners had to scold their

317
00:19:32,121 --> 00:19:35,330
dogs because you know, they had been
told that their dogs did something bad.

318
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:39,980
But the trick of the experiment is that
only half the dogs had done something.

319
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:44,180
Half the dogs had actually been naughty
and half the dogs had not been naughty.

320
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,230
But then she

321
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:50,030
misinformed the owners lied to
half of the owners to the owners.

322
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:53,990
So even the owners who just dogs hadn't
been bad thought their dogs had been

323
00:19:53,991 --> 00:19:57,500
bad. So everybody scolded their dog
and everyone did this the same way,

324
00:19:57,501 --> 00:20:02,000
which was to say no loudly to their dog
and maybe put their hands on their hip

325
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:06,320
and expressed as a credible
yes can again, and again

326
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,493
it's okay.

327
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,700
See Finnegan just made the look even
though he hadn't done anything wrong.

328
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,440
And that's essentially what she found.

329
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,710
Even the non guilty dogs
made the guilty look.

330
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,580
It didn't matter whether the
dog had transgressed or not.

331
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,670
All that mattered was whether it
was being chastised by its owner.

332
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:28,670
So bad dog, bad dog, right?
That creates the look,

333
00:20:28,671 --> 00:20:32,600
not the deed. That's exactly
right. But, but for me,

334
00:20:32,601 --> 00:20:35,510
the pivotal question here is not
whether or not they all had the look,

335
00:20:35,511 --> 00:20:36,770
but what's attached to that?

336
00:20:36,771 --> 00:20:39,620
Look what feeling in the dog is
attached to that guilty look.

337
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,460
Maybe the dogs who were
falsely accused still felt bad.

338
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:48,070
Well maybe they did. Maybe they

339
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,610
didn't have. Maybe there are angels
on top of this control console here.

340
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,220
[inaudible]

341
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:17,460
I thought it was a perfectly valid
question. We should think, uh,

342
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,230
Alexander Horowitz, her latest
book is called inside of $8

343
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:25,940
[inaudible]

344
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,740
and before we end this section,

345
00:21:27,741 --> 00:21:32,300
I have we resolved the question of what
was that whale doing with those people?

346
00:21:32,301 --> 00:21:36,740
Was she saying thank you or no? No. And
do we ever resolve any questions at all?

347
00:21:36,741 --> 00:21:41,120
Well, we try. We give a little closer
to them. No, we have not resolved five.

348
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:44,270
We will try harder. But, but,
but, but in our snack section,

349
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,740
a mere 70 seconds away,

350
00:21:45,741 --> 00:21:49,340
we will try very hard to actually
get scientific about it. Good.
