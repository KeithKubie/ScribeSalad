RICHARD KESSLER: I'm
Richard Kessler.

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.490
I'm the dean of Mannes College
at the New School for Music.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.360
And I am really thrilled
to be here today.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.700
We're all thrilled.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.300
We have here some good friends
and colleagues.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.600
We have Kathy Supove on piano,
one of our faculty members.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.150
This is Cathy.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.990
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.160
RICHARD KESSLER: And we have
these wonderful colleagues and

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.185
friends and partners, Sideband
here today as well.

00:00:22.185 --> 00:00:23.520
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.230
RICHARD KESSLER: And
we have a really

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.680
special program for you.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.820
And I'm really excited
to get to it.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.340
Let me start with some
introductions.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.780
First, I'm going to tell
you a little bit

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.320
about Mannes College.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.450
We're a 100-year-old music
conservatory that's part of

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:38.760
the New School.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.910
Many of you know the New
School as Parsons.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.960
Or some of you know the New
School as the New School for

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.800
Social Research.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.670
We're the music conservatory
at the New School.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.330
And we have three different
divisions.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.780
We have a college division where
we give out degrees, all

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.290
kinds of degrees, bachelors
degrees, master's degrees,

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.140
diplomas, certificates.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.200
We also have a preparatory
division, where we have

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.900
students from the ages of 4 to
18 years old who invade the

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.370
school on Saturday and take over
every single space you

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.990
could possibly imagine, making
music in every possible way.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.110
And we also have an extension
division, which is for

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.920
continuing ed, where adults
come and learn

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.760
and engage in music.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.090
It's also a place where we
provide all kinds of courses,

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.120
all kinds of classwork.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.230
And there's all kinds of
opportunities for partnership

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.920
in the extension division.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.680
Let me read to you--
you'd think I

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.460
would know it by heart.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.920
But actually it's fairly new.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.760
And I have actually never read
it to anyone before.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.280
I'm going to read to you our
mission, actually, at Mannes,

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.480
because I think it informs the
day to day a little bit.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.600
We're dedicated to stimulating,
supporting, and

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.030
advancing the creative role of
music in all aspects of a

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.190
rapidly changing society.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.760
Mannes seeks to develop citizen
artists who engage the

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.210
world around them in and through
music in traditional,

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.240
emergent, and new forms
of practice.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.460
And another way of looking at it
is we're reinventing a very

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.030
old traditional model.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.910
And I mean old by something
that's been practiced in

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.900
certain ways in classical
music since

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.090
the 1400s or 1500s.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.699
We're looking to reinvent
ourselves through new music,

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:12.640
through technology, and a
commitment to community.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.940
And we have our partners here
today to give you a glimpse

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.400
and a sense of the kinds of
things we're embarking on.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.980
Sideband is a tremendous model
in terms of how you use

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.220
technology to make music
and engage with people.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.840
It's interesting in terms of
its performance quality.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.140
It's interesting in terms
of its research.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.680
And I think it's interesting in
terms of it being a model

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.010
for engaging people in all
sorts of new ways.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.880
Now, before we go on with
Sideband and Kathy Supove, let

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.230
me first say thanks to the
Google organizers, Kate

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.640
Clugston and her team, Melissa
Carroll, John Clemente and his

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.100
team, Lee Stimmel,
and Phil Ames.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.985
Thank you very much for
making today possible.

00:02:56.985 --> 00:03:01.170
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.700
RICHARD KESSLER: Now, I'd also
like to say there's all sorts

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.210
of opportunities to partner with
us, to engage with us in

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.500
what we're doing today.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.020
We're looking for friends, we're
looking for supporters,

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.990
we're looking for help.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.530
And if you're interested in
working with us, working with

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.230
Sideband, working with Kathy,
please contact Kate Clugston.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.120
She'd be the point person within
Google to do that.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.800
OK so now, it's nice to move
on from hearing myself talk

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.540
and instead move right
to the music.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.520
So we're going to move to
Sideband, and they have two

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.510
pieces that they're going to
play for you back to back.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.240
The first case they're going
to play-- and after they

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.050
perform, they're going to
introduce themselves a little

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.790
bit, give you history of the
ensemble, background.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.460
It's going to be a good
presentation, but we're

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:42.650
starting with music.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.670
So Sideband is going to do the
first piece, which is called

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.140
"Balls," and it's by Konrad
Kaczmarek, and the second

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.010
piece, which is called
"In Line," and

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.490
it's by Jascha Narvesen.

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.930
And it's a 10 minute segment,
and then we'll go to some

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.500
questions, but let's go
right to Sideband.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.363
Everyone, welcome Sideband.

00:04:01.363 --> 00:04:07.512
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:07.512 --> 00:15:00.264
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:00.264 --> 00:15:11.100
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:12.450
DAN TRUEMAN: My name's
Dan Trueman.

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:16.220
I am one of the founders
of the Princeton Laptop

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:19.300
Orchestra, which we
started in 2005.

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.540
I started it with Perry
Cook, professor of

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:22.480
computer science there.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.550
I'm a professor in the
composition department, music

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:25.450
department.

00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:28.690
And Sideband, these wonderful
musicians here, this is the

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:32.920
professional outgrowth of the
student group that is the

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:33.970
Princeton Laptop Orchestra.

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:36.830
And the aim of the Princeton
Laptop Orchestra, this was

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:40.260
back in 2005, we wanted to see,
can we figure out how to

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.800
make music together
with computers?

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.720
Up to that point, classes in
electronic music were always

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.160
taught in a studio, and you work
alone, and you make some

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.750
fixed product that you share
with people, but the notion of

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:56.960
actually making music together
and finding out what we can do

00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:01.490
with computation in a music
making contact really didn't

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:02.790
happen much at that time.

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:05.120
So that was the aim here, and
that's what we're still

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.510
working on.

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:09.030
Two pieces there.

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:13.590
The first one, affectionately
referred to as Konrad's Balls,

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:17.421
was done by Konrad Kaczmarek
over there, you saw there.

00:16:17.421 --> 00:16:19.830
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:23.750
And one of the fun things about
that is exploring a

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:27.810
system that you can set things
loose in and see how they

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:29.760
behave, and see what kind
of sounds they make.

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:32.600
And then you saw at the end when
they turned the screens

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.960
around, basically, the network
is used to connect their

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:40.640
systems so that their animated
balls can be passed from one

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.820
machine to the next and
their sounds can be

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:45.740
collaboratively created.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:49.440
And then that was followed
directly by Jascha Narveson's

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:49.640
"In

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:56.170
Line." [APPLAUSE]

00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:58.070
Lots of fun things to talk about
there, but I think the

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:01.500
obvious thing was using these
game controllers there to try

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.950
to get a more physical
engagement with sound.

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:07.700
The first piece, we sit at the
laptops and type away and so

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:11.010
on, and that's all fine and
good, but it's also nice to

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:13.010
get up and actually
be physically

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:14.230
involved with the sound.

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:16.470
And these little game
controllers

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:18.619
here are about $15.

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:20.045
They were made for
a golf game.

00:17:20.045 --> 00:17:22.550
They come with little gloves
that your attach

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:25.710
these strings to.

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:31.010
It's very, I guess, it's very
last year, but you swing your

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:33.760
hands with the little plastic
golf club, and then a little

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:37.120
avatar of your golf player
shows up on the screen.

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.230
They're fantastic music
controllers.

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:41.770
We had to go in and hack them a
little bit to have them work

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:48.370
for us, but they've become
pretty widely used in laptop

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:51.990
performance around the
world, really.

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:55.440
What else should I say about
that piece or the controllers,

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.850
other than that they're really
cool, and I wish

00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:00.420
they still made them?

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:04.720
The other thing maybe I'll
comment on briefly are these

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.690
shiny little speakers.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:10.680
And I think these are
particularly relevant to the

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.240
kinds of things that Richard
was talking about, thinking

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:17.470
about Mannes and a very old
conservatory focused for a

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:20.470
long time on making music
together in old fashioned

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:23.220
ways, something that I'm
actually very drawn to.

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:25.960
And one of the aims of these
speakers here is to actually,

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:30.400
in some way, enable us to try
to make music together with

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.120
computers in a kind of
old fashioned way.

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:36.580
Rather than having each laptop
plugged into a mixer and all

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:38.940
the sound coming through
speakers that are separated

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.730
from our bodies and really hard
to associate with what

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:44.570
we're doing ourselves, these
are meant to be near us as

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:47.030
performers, and also they're
meant to fill rooms from the

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:50.600
inside out with sound rather
than projected from the

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.590
outside in.

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:55.960
So these are one of the main
characteristics of the

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:58.860
Princeton Laptop Orchestra
and Sideband.

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:02.920
So is that a good enough
summary here?

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:07.400
There will be questions later,
of course, and also, if you

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:11.080
like, you can come try our very
fancy software that we've

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:11.530
built here.

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:12.810
All this stuff, all
these pieces,

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:14.650
we build them ourselves.

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:16.590
The software is all
stuff that we make

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:19.150
ourselves for each piece.

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:20.850
And with that, I think
I'll hand it over.

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:23.660
Kathy, are you next for doing
your piece, or is

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:24.910
Richard going to--

00:19:26.852 --> 00:19:27.314
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:27.314 --> 00:19:28.240
RICHARD KESSLER:
Thank you, Dan.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.490
Thank you so much.

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:34.140
It's a really interesting thing
when you think about

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:37.990
taking this new technology, new
approaches, and bringing

00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:40.870
it into a school that's
primarily been working in

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:43.090
really old modalities.

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:45.390
What happens in terms
of culture shock?

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:47.300
What happens in terms of people
trying to wrap their

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:49.830
head around the technology,
around the meaning in terms of

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:50.440
the practice?

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.730
How do you make music with
new technologies?

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:56.490
Can you take the very old
practice and basically wet it

00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:59.700
and have it live inside
something like this?

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:02.070
And that's ultimately what we're
trying to do, based on

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:04.510
the model of Sideband and
what Dan has been

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:05.780
explaining to you.

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:09.150
Anyway, my job for the moment is
to introduce Kathy Supove.

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:12.210
Kathe is one of our favorite
faculty members at Mannes.

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:15.910
She's someone who is expert at
teaching adults, someone who's

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:20.560
expert at teaching kids, but
I've known for many years as

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:24.650
one of the leading pianists
in terms of new music, new

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:25.740
approaches.

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:28.620
She's a person that composers
are drawn to when composers

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:31.440
think, who is willing
to try something?

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.220
Who's willing to take a risk?

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:36.050
What pianist is interested
in something new?

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:36.920
That's Kathy.

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.290
That's her reputation, that's
what she's known

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:40.490
throughout the field.

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:43.030
She does it in an extraordinary
way with a great

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:45.670
commitment, and she's one
of the leaders in the

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:47.080
field of new music.

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.350
I'm really thrilled to be able
to introduce her to you right

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:52.150
now, and she's going to tell
you a little bit more about

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:54.060
the piece that she's going
to perform with Sideband.

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:56.300
So everyone, please welcome
Kathy Supove.

00:20:56.300 --> 00:21:03.410
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:06.390
KATHY SUPOVE: I'm just going to
make a few short remarks.

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:07.980
Thank you, Richard, very much.

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:10.550
I hope I can live up to that.

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:16.100
I am a classically trained
pianist, but I ended up being

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:19.760
a pianist that promotes,
premieres, commissions, and

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:24.320
records music by the Beethovens
of today, like some

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:25.780
of the people you see here.

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:29.230
And it's kind of a saga how
I ended up doing that.

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:32.710
I was dissatisfied with a lot
of the things about being a

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:34.940
conventional pianist.

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:39.670
But one of the things that
bothered me about it was it's

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:42.800
a little bit lonely
being a pianist.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:45.450
You're kind of in this practice
room, and you're with

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:47.580
this one sound of the
instrument, and it's a

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:51.630
fabulous instrument, unequalled
in my opinion, but

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:53.240
you're kind of all
by yourself.

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:55.770
And I always used to think, what
would it be like to play

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:58.790
piano at the beach, or what
would it be like to play piano

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:02.240
in a circus, or various
settings and

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:02.940
that kind of thing.

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:06.760
And I think that has something
to do with how I ended up

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:11.480
migrating toward creating
works with composers or

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:14.920
collaborating with them and
encouraging them to create

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:17.840
works for piano plus
something else.

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:21.730
And today, I'm going to be doing
a piece that's piano

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:24.710
plus an electronic soundtrack.

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:29.060
And one of things a soundtrack
can do, I mean, it can

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:31.980
simulate a chamber music partner
and do that kind of

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:34.290
thing, but the other thing
it can do is create an

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:38.130
environment that you're
playing in.

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:42.700
And so I can feel like I'm
playing piano in some weird,

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:49.040
surreal, historic version of
Bali or something like that.

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:52.520
Anyway, I've found it's just
been really fulfilling.

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:56.650
The name of the piece I'm going
to play is "What Remains

00:22:56.650 --> 00:23:01.560
of a Rembrandt," and it's based
on a pamphlet that the

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:07.230
playwright Jean Genet put out,
and it has some kind of very

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:08.200
weird translation.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:13.000
But basically, what it implies
is what remains of a Rembrandt

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.450
if you took away all the
associations that you

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:17.210
conventionally have with it?

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:20.840
And the composer,
Randall Woolf--

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:23.800
by the way, full disclosure, he
is my husband and he could

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.580
not be here today,
unfortunately.

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:30.330
But what I think he had in mind
was if you took away all

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:34.850
your conventional notions of the
composer Claude Debussy,

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:36.170
what would you end up with?

00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:40.270
And so he's answered
that question.

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:43.780
And just to give away some
secrets, some of the

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:47.440
ingredients that he's used in
the soundtrack that I play

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:56.480
along with is a Debussy opera,
some Vietnamese gongs, and

00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:00.090
some kind of gunshot that he
has played around with

00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:02.690
electronically so you
can't recognize it.

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:05.240
And he also managed to
throw in my favorite

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:08.020
Debussy piano piece.

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:09.420
And I hope you enjoy it.

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:10.550
This is an excerpt.

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:11.610
It's not the whole piece.

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:16.030
The whole piece is too long for
today, but I hope you'll

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:18.250
enjoy it very much.

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:24.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:24.200 --> 00:35:04.380
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:16.050
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:17.200
KATHY SUPOVE: Thank you.

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:22.370
Somehow, I've been drafted to
introduce this next piece, but

00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:24.490
it's great because it gives
me a chance to talk about

00:35:24.490 --> 00:35:29.600
Sideband a little bit, and
I first heard the Laptop

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:32.450
Orchestra from Princeton fairly
soon after it was

00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:36.280
founded, I think, in Carnegie
Hall with the American

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:37.820
Composers Orchestra.

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:41.570
And I immediately thought that
this was a group I wanted to

00:35:41.570 --> 00:35:43.330
make music with.

00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:46.310
So it's interesting Richard was
talking to you about new

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:50.610
ways of making music, and to
me, it just seems totally

00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:53.420
natural for a pianist
to want to play

00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:54.850
with a laptop orchestra.

00:35:54.850 --> 00:35:57.660
I mean, it's just
totally natural.

00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:58.540
Of course.

00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:02.960
I mean, they're so at the
forefront in terms of what

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:05.060
they're doing, but at
the same time, but

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:08.340
very musical and appealing.

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:14.430
So it wasn't too long before I
got in touch with Dan Trueman

00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:18.190
and asked him about writing
a piece for me.

00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:23.260
And it took a few years to
happen, but it did finally,

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:24.020
and it was great.

00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:29.100
And a couple of surprises came
along along the way.

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:33.190
Dan wrote a fabulous piece for
me, which you should all hear.

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:35.120
It's coming out on recording
eventually.

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:38.030
I'm sure you can ask Dan
when it will be out.

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:40.760
But I got a couple of
surprises in the

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:42.190
middle of the project.

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:47.020
One was that Michael Early
wrote a piece for me and

00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:50.070
Sideband also called "Victorian
Webs," which we're

00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:52.540
going to perform
today for you.

00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:59.740
And "Victorian Webs," it's
kind of a tribute to the

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:03.990
beginning of Morse code, and
you'll hear some music in it

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:07.580
that, I guess it is
Morse code, and it

00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:09.000
sounds like Morse code.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.010
But at the same time, my part is
the Victorian part, and so

00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:17.120
this person is going into the
new technology, but at the

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:22.840
same time has a nostalgia for
the old, much the same way as

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:26.760
the computer age has come upon
us and we have nostalgia for

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:29.170
things sometimes.

00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:32.550
So we play different roles, and
it's interesting because I

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:34.610
always hear their airport
in my mind.

00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:37.280
It goes around, it's kind of in
my ear all the time, and I

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:39.010
notice them going around
humming the

00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:40.520
piano part that I play.

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:43.440
So we're kind of each
other's ear worms.

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:48.000
And I also wanted to mention
that Konrad Kaczmarek also let

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.180
me play his piece at one point,
and he's a professional

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:54.020
level pianist himself, so I
really appreciate that.

00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:57.230
And we very much hope
you enjoy this.

00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:01.340
Yes.

00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:02.290
Oh, yeah.

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:04.370
Absolutely.

00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:05.230
LAINIE FEFFERMAN: Thanks.

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:05.700
Hello.

00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:07.400
Hi.

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:09.366
We are just going to introduce
ourselves really quick so you

00:38:09.366 --> 00:38:12.170
know who it is making
these noises.

00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:13.230
I'm Lainie Fefferman.

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:14.330
I am a composer.

00:38:14.330 --> 00:38:16.460
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:18.070
I'm a composer.

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:20.830
I am about to finish, hopefully,
my Ph.D. in

00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:22.970
composition at Princeton.

00:38:22.970 --> 00:38:23.840
Everyone on the stage
is somehow

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:26.750
affiliated with Princeton.

00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:29.160
I'm new to technology, but I've
got to say Sideband is

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:31.400
making me fall in love with
making music combined with

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:32.810
technology.

00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:35.120
By day, I'm a math teacher.

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:38.320
I've been singing a lot,
and I love Google.

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.270
I'm happy to be at Google.

00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:41.635
Here's Caroline.

00:38:41.635 --> 00:38:42.090
CAROLINE SHAW: Hi.

00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:43.010
I'm Caroline Shaw.

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:46.800
I'm a violinist and singer
and composer, and also at

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:50.070
Princeton, friends of
Gabe Taubman and Jen

00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:51.400
Chang who work here.

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:51.970
You guys are awesome.

00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:53.880
Thanks.

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:53.990
ANNE HEGE: Hi.

00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:55.280
I'm Ann Hege.

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:58.060
I'm also finishing up at
Princeton with my degree in

00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:01.680
composition, and I'm a singer,
and I'm really interested in

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:04.495
movement and sound and
that connection.

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:07.310
DAN IGLESIA: Hi.

00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:10.860
I'm Dan Iglesia, composer,
media artist, programmer,

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:14.170
co-leader of PLOrk for
a few seasons,

00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:17.370
and member of Sideband.

00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:19.510
JASCHA NARVESON: Hi, I'm Jascha
Narveson, former tabla

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:22.870
player, composition major,
computer programmer,

00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:25.360
electronic music
type of person.

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:28.530
Also, I feel incumbent upon me
to mention that Caroline Shaw

00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:30.852
won the Pulitzer Prize in
composition this year, so you

00:39:30.852 --> 00:39:32.469
can just give her a hand.

00:39:32.469 --> 00:39:37.520
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:37.750
KONRAD KACZMAREK: Hi.

00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:42.150
I'm Konrad Kaczmarek, also
a graduate composer at

00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:45.106
Princeton, finishing up.

00:39:45.106 --> 00:39:48.670
I wrote that first piece, the
Balls piece, so if you're

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:50.820
interested in hearing more about
that, please come up

00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:51.870
afterwards, ask me.

00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:53.126
Thanks.

00:39:53.126 --> 00:39:53.620
JEFF SNYDER: Hi.

00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:54.330
I'm Jeff Snyder.

00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:57.780
I'm not playing on this piece,
but I was on the first two.

00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:03.020
I'm a research scholar at
Princeton, and I'm a composer

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:05.990
and improviser, and also
electrical engineer.

00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:09.630
So I have a company building
some instruments that, if

00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:10.650
you've heard of the
Snyderphonics

00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:12.824
Manta, that's me.

00:40:12.824 --> 00:40:26.600
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:26.600 --> 00:49:18.162
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:49:18.162 --> 00:49:42.564
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:42.564 --> 00:49:43.062
RICHARD KESSLER: Excellent.

00:49:43.062 --> 00:49:45.660
Thank you, Sideband,
and Kathy.

00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:46.310
Wonderful piece.

00:49:46.310 --> 00:49:47.980
I love that piece.

00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:52.520
We have about two minutes left
in the formal program.

00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:54.850
Those who want to stay
afterwards, you can come up.

00:49:54.850 --> 00:49:56.320
You can talk to the
band members.

00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:57.675
You can talk to anyone.

00:49:57.675 --> 00:49:59.200
They have offered for you
if you want to take

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:01.000
a look at the equipment.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.190
I think we have time probably
for one question.

00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:05.510
I also want to remind you if
you want to get involved,

00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:09.180
there's a lot of opportunities
to get involved with the band,

00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:10.390
with Mannes.

00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:11.750
There's all sorts of
things we're doing.

00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:14.010
We're creating community
choruses.

00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:15.250
We have courses that we offer.

00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:17.280
We could be teaching courses
here, too, if you like.

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:19.760
But anyway, context
Kate Clugston if

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:20.620
you want to get involved.

00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:23.740
So we have time for one
question, and then afterwards,

00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:26.070
certainly, please come
up and ask whatever

00:50:26.070 --> 00:50:27.450
questions you like.

00:50:27.450 --> 00:50:28.890
Time for one question?

00:50:28.890 --> 00:50:31.820
AUDIENCE: Earlier, you played
with that controller, game

00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:34.580
controller, with strings
attached.

00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:38.770
So Microsoft Xbox has this
motion controller where you

00:50:38.770 --> 00:50:42.230
use a video camera to see
how your body moves.

00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:46.130
So have you think about tying
that together with the music,

00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:47.490
the pianos?

00:50:47.490 --> 00:50:49.670
DAN IGLESIA: We as an ensemble
have not tried it.

00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:54.100
I personally have developed for
Kinect, making instruments

00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:57.860
that use Kinect to detect
objects, detect people.

00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:00.400
There are certainly pros
and cons with it.

00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:02.460
I, for example, love the
Kinect because lighting

00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:07.110
doesn't matter, just physicality
and space matters.

00:51:07.110 --> 00:51:09.530
Somebody may write a piece
for us that uses Kinect.

00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:11.240
It's certainly a possibility
in the future.

00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:15.330
We definitely like these in
terms of being physically

00:51:15.330 --> 00:51:17.330
connected, these are
extremely robust.

00:51:17.330 --> 00:51:19.410
There's not a lot of jitter
as there is in

00:51:19.410 --> 00:51:21.570
some IR camera systems.

00:51:21.570 --> 00:51:24.280
But yeah, we're certainly open
to all manner of bizarre

00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:26.430
hardware configurations.

00:51:26.430 --> 00:51:27.594
AUDIENCE: Great, thanks.

00:51:27.594 --> 00:51:28.247
RICHARD KESSLER: All
right, we're at

00:51:28.247 --> 00:51:29.830
the end of our program.

00:51:29.830 --> 00:51:31.830
Let's have another round
of applause for

00:51:31.830 --> 00:51:33.940
Sideband, Kathy Supove.

00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:34.370
Thank you.

00:51:34.370 --> 00:51:35.200
Thank you so much.

00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:45.692
[APPLAUSE]
