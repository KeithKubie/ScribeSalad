00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.750
Before we learn how to make better computers

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.000
we need to learn what better means for

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.680
computers and how do we measure that. In

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.810
this lesson you will learn about latency and

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.940
throughput, which we use as a measure of

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.920
computer performance. Then we will look at how

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.690
to measure performance of real computers using benchmarks

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.370
and a few general ways to get good performance.
