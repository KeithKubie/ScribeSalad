like in practice so the key thing here

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.040
like in practice so the key thing here
 

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.940
like in practice so the key thing here
is that ultimately we're just going to

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:09.950
is that ultimately we're just going to
 

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:12.550
is that ultimately we're just going to
create a link and the link will encode

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:12.560

going to receive the prefilled
 

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:33.850
going to receive the prefilled
parameters in the URL there's such a

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:33.860
parameters in the URL there's such a
 

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:36.490
parameters in the URL there's such a
standard HTTP GET type of stuff that's

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:36.500
standard HTTP GET type of stuff that's
 

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:37.630

HTTP of course Chili's going to create

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:40.730
HTTP of course Chili's going to create
 

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:42.340
HTTP of course Chili's going to create
the loyalty counter system however they

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:42.350
the loyalty counter system however they
 

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:45.160
the loyalty counter system however they
would normally do that and we come to

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:45.170
would normally do that and we come to
 

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:47.290
would normally do that and we come to
the fun part Chili's is going to create

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:47.300
the fun part Chili's is going to create
 

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:51.130
the fun part Chili's is going to create
a loyalty object then they're going to

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:51.140
a loyalty object then they're going to
 

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:53.710
a loyalty object then they're going to
turn that object into a JSON web token

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:53.720
turn that object into a JSON web token
 

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.070
turn that object into a JSON web token
this gives us a signed a serialized

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:56.080
this gives us a signed a serialized
 

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.910
this gives us a signed a serialized
representation of that loyalty object

00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:57.920
representation of that loyalty object
 

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:01.540
representation of that loyalty object
and finally Chili's is going to generate

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:01.550
and finally Chili's is going to generate
 

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:03.760
and finally Chili's is going to generate
a deep link from that token that they

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:03.770
a deep link from that token that they
 

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:06.610
a deep link from that token that they
can use from multiple channels but let's

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:06.620
can use from multiple channels but let's
 

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.610
can use from multiple channels but let's
go deeper so this is what the loyalty

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:09.620
go deeper so this is what the loyalty
 

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:12.940
go deeper so this is what the loyalty
object creation code looks like all we

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:12.950
object creation code looks like all we
 

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:14.230
object creation code looks like all we
really need from you is about eight

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:14.240
really need from you is about eight
 

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.150
really need from you is about eight
pieces of data and we show you how to

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:16.160
pieces of data and we show you how to
 

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.850
pieces of data and we show you how to
plug them in here points and balance

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:18.860
plug them in here points and balance
 

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:22.510
plug them in here points and balance
your class ID this comes up when you

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:22.520
your class ID this comes up when you
 

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:25.890
your class ID this comes up when you
create this loyalty class in our system

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:25.900
create this loyalty class in our system
 

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:28.840
create this loyalty class in our system
it's an active loyalty state an account

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:28.850
it's an active loyalty state an account
 

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:32.260
it's an active loyalty state an account
ID a name again just fairly boilerplate

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:32.270
ID a name again just fairly boilerplate
 

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.810
ID a name again just fairly boilerplate
stuff you just drop the code and the

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:34.820
stuff you just drop the code and the
 

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:36.820
stuff you just drop the code and the
data in here and then you build and you

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:36.830
data in here and then you build and you
 

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:39.430
data in here and then you build and you
have your loyalty object so now we're

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:39.440
have your loyalty object so now we're
 

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.750
have your loyalty object so now we're
going to turn that object into the JSON

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:40.760
going to turn that object into the JSON
 

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.370
going to turn that object into the JSON
web token so this is an expansion of

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:42.380
web token so this is an expansion of
 

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:45.190
web token so this is an expansion of
that second step I showed you again we

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:45.200
that second step I showed you again we
 

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.160
that second step I showed you again we
have some simpler boilerplate here not

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:48.170
have some simpler boilerplate here not
 

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:49.090
have some simpler boilerplate here not
going to walk you through all of this

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:49.100
going to walk you through all of this
 

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:50.650
going to walk you through all of this
right now but you just drop this in your

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:50.660
right now but you just drop this in your
 

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:52.210
right now but you just drop this in your
code and at the end of this you have a

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:52.220
code and at the end of this you have a
 

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:56.350
code and at the end of this you have a
serialized signed web token finally the

00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:56.360
serialized signed web token finally the
 

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.670
serialized signed web token finally the
last part of our code is to turn that

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:57.680
last part of our code is to turn that
 

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:00.520
last part of our code is to turn that
into a safe to Android pay deep link and

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:00.530
into a safe to Android pay deep link and
 

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:01.780
into a safe to Android pay deep link and
this is what the formatted that looks

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:01.790
this is what the formatted that looks
 

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:05.770
this is what the formatted that looks
like we're going to that JWT that job is

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:05.780
like we're going to that JWT that job is
 

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:07.810
like we're going to that JWT that job is
that web token so we're gonna create the

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:07.820
that web token so we're gonna create the
 

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.510
that web token so we're gonna create the
link add the token into it and that's

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:10.520
link add the token into it and that's
 

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.640
link add the token into it and that's
the safe to Android pay deep link so to

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:12.650
