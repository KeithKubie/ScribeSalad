KAREN SOMBERG:
I'm Karen Somberg.

00:00:03.675 --> 00:00:07.364
I'm the diversity lead for tech.

00:00:07.364 --> 00:00:09.780
And I probably wouldn't normally
be the person introducing

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.920
this session, but I
used to work for Sylvia

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.420
at the Center for
Talent Innovation,

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.220
and I joined Google last year.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.170
So it was very exciting to
welcome her back here today

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.840
to talk about executive
presence, which

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.350
was a piece of research
that started happening

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.960
when I was still at the center.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.690
And was really transformative
for me and for others

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:31.950
as we talked to companies.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.400
About thinking about,
what is leadership?

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.510
What is are the
leadership archetypes,

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.209
and how do you become an
effective communicator?

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:43.250
And you know, what does
it mean to have gravitas?

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.400
And all these big pieces that
we don't often think about,

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.320
but that are crucially important
in addition to doing our work.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.880
Also, how we come across and
how we relay our messages.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.876
So I'm excited to welcome
Sylvia here today.

00:00:57.876 --> 00:00:59.876
One thing that I learned
about executive-- well,

00:00:59.876 --> 00:01:02.500
I learned a lot of things about
executive presence from Sylvia.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.450
But one was that
you should always

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.751
have one fun piece
of-- you know, maybe

00:01:07.751 --> 00:01:09.750
in your appearance-- some
fun piece of clothing.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.416
That was always
something that I noticed

00:01:11.416 --> 00:01:14.150
that she did, and used
very effectively actually.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.910
And so, in honor of her
today, I wore leopard shoes,

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.330
because she always had leopard.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.240
And I think she has a bag that's
leopard, so I'm right on target

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.970
today.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.665
But I wore like
Google-safe leopard,

00:01:24.665 --> 00:01:26.319
you know, not too much.

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:28.360
But I'm very excited about
to welcome Sylvia here

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.401
to talk about her new book
on executive presence,

00:01:30.401 --> 00:01:33.450
which was voted the best book of
the month by Amazon this month.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.480
So pretty awesome.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.426
And so, without further
ado, Sylvia, welcome.

00:01:38.426 --> 00:01:39.845
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.030
SYLVIA ANN HEWLETT: So it is
fabulous to connect with Karen.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.280
She has much more important
things to do this morning,

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.070
but we already did a little
catch up over breakfast.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.580
So that was fabulous.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.610
I want to begin with a story,
because this topic goes

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.790
to the core of
some of my failure,

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.840
and some of the challenges
I had early in my life.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.940
I grew up in the coal
mining area of South Wales.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.340
This is a very depressed
piece of the UK.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.580
The unemployment rate in my
valley when I was growing up

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.500
was 38% because the coal
industry was closing down.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.120
And I did come from a
hardscrabble family.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.270
And partly because of
the women's movement,

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.370
partly because they
were trying to get folks

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.850
from the wrong side of the
tracks to major universities,

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.660
I did end up at
Cambridge when I was 18.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.670
And I was bright.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.120
I did pass a lot of exams.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.110
But I spoke English with this
thick working-class Welsh

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.620
accent, which was
the kiss of death

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.820
in polite English society,
which is very class-conscious.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.570
I also I did not use
grammar kind of correctly.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.830
I grew up with a
lot of bad habits,

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.830
because this was not
a reading household.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.140
And I remember
knowing when I was 18

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.750
that no matter how
great I was at my work,

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.690
every time I opened my
mouth, I let myself down.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.400
It was also true that Cambridge
was only 7% female at the time.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.780
So there was enough going on,
in terms of the gender barriers,

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.040
to make me feel
that at least I had

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.720
to fix the way I talk if I
was going to get anywhere.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.540
So I spent two years listening
to the BBC World Service,

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.630
practicing those
modulated tones,

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.610
and also fixing my grammar.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.430
And it did make me
much more accessible,

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:01.000
much more successful, much more
able to actually communicate

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.310
my thoughts.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.200
Now, looking back
on it, there was

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.690
a lot of bias going on
in that story, right?

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.410
What's wrong with
regional accents?

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.740
What's wrong with
working-class accents?

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.320
Now, I did need
to fix my grammar.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.750
That was a good idea, right?

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:30.010
You do want to use the language
that is your main vehicle well.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.380
But back then, because
class was such an issue,

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.370
I also really had to
change the way I spoke.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.040
So I mean, this business
of how you communicate,

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:50.320
there is this tension between
authenticity and conformity.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.580
And I think all of
our corporate cultures

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.960
present us with some
of these challenges.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:55.750
What works?

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.800
What gets you over
the next hurdle?

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.900
But what is true to yourself?

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.830
So let's look at this data.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.290
We've got some
amazing data on what

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.020
is going on in corporate
America right now.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.850
We looked at 14 sectors,
including the tech sector.

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.870
And I will talk some about the
specificities of the Silicon

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.030
Valley challenge.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:24.010
So first off, I founded the
Task Force on Talent Innovation

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.140
some 10 years ago.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.880
Google has been a leader or this
group for the last six years.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.800
So I have been very much
involved in your talent journey

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.120
here.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.990
In terms of this study, we
have collected incredible data

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:49.540
around what allows you to
be seen as having potential,

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.150
as being leadership
material, as being

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.900
ready for the next
big thing, right?

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.050
And one thing I want
to emphasize here

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:05.150
is executive presence is
really not about performance.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.730
It's not about whether you
really do deliver the goods,

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:13.910
hit the numbers,
really know your craft,

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:15.840
and have the skills.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:21.250
It's about what you signal
about your preparedness

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:25.350
for the next big chance.

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.170
We find, right across
sectors, that there

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:32.360
are three main pillars
of executive presence

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.970
which leaders look for.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.600
And in this data, we
went out to hundreds

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.890
of representative leaders
across the private sector.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.110
We also did a ton of focus
groups and interviews,

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:49.480
so this really reflects a lot
about data collection in terms

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:56.150
of what is important in
the eyes of your boss.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:57.829
So these are the
three dimensions.

00:06:57.829 --> 00:06:58.620
Now think gravitas.

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.070
That is a biggie.

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.240
When we think of that
word, what comes to mind?

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.650
I mean, what do you associate
with the word gravitas?

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:13.470
Force?

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:16.020
Competence?

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:20.860
Heft, in terms of being seen
as an intellectual heavyweight?

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.600
I mean, how do
signal that, right?

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.100
Credibility.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.714
Eloquence.

00:07:29.714 --> 00:07:31.505
Remember, we're talking
about communication

00:07:31.505 --> 00:07:33.700
a little separately
here, but you

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:39.150
think that that is part
of the gravitas piece.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:42.160
Impact-- very good word.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.770
So we had a bunch
of words, right,

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:46.990
that seem to describe it.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:50.810
But we probably don't know
what is most important, right?

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:54.140
So let's take a look at
what the data is telling us,

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:58.430
realizing that there is some
intermingling of these things.

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:03.570
For instance, you can have
the most amazing heft,

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:08.050
but if you can't be compelling
in how you talk about it,

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:12.720
it remains locked up, it becomes
a well-kept secret, right?

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.700
So obviously these
things are interlinked.

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:21.650
So what we find in the
data is that gravitas--

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:25.220
really right across
the spectrum here--

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:29.110
is seen as the most
important piece.

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:32.380
Signalling to the world that
you know your stuff cold,

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:37.870
that you're five questions deep
on your domain of expertise,

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:40.020
that it's at your fingertips.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.549
Right?

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:45.290
There is a very interesting
picture emerging here

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:47.840
across ethnicity.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.790
And basically what senior
leaders are telling us

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:52.870
in this survey is
what they're looking

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:58.150
for in terms of their team--
their mid-level managers,

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:01.470
their high-potential
younger folks, et cetera.

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.495
As we can see, whether
you're Caucasian

00:09:03.495 --> 00:09:06.500
or Asian or female
or male, there's

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.720
tremendous uniformity in terms
of the rough proportions.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.060
You know, gravitas
is the biggie,

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:17.420
communication skills is the
second piece that is important,

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:21.760
and then the appearance piece
seems to be quite small.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.750
They are all interesting
differences here.

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:28.140
For instance, for
African American leaders,

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.060
they are particularly
looking for gravitas.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:35.580
And they say, we know that we
struggle with this ourselves.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.970
There is the specter
of Affirmative Action.

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:40.560
They're saying,
it's as though we've

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.890
got to re-audition for
our jobs all the time,

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:47.160
because perhaps way back
we got an unfair chance.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.420
And in our interviews,
we found that gravitas

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:53.960
seemed to be a
particularly big hurdle

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.810
for African American
want-to-be leaders.

00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:00.380
For Asian individuals,
communication

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:03.300
is often somewhat
more difficult.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.730
If you come from a
respect-filled deferential

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:09.660
culture, right, and
you value consensus,

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:14.560
how do you get to be forceful
enough in an American-centric

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.040
corporation?

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:21.010
And again, bias, very
infused in this data.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:24.370
But the main message
here is that there's

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:29.550
tremendous agreement in
terms of what matters.

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:33.020
So moving on, let's
look at the top picks.

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.620
We presented our leaders
with about 50 traits,

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:38.160
these are the top six.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:42.860
And again, amazing agreement.

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:48.790
Female and male leaders really
picking a very similar list.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:54.070
Top of the list there is this--
confidence, poise, credibility,

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.070
grace under fire.

00:10:56.070 --> 00:11:00.880
Someone who can keep
their cool and credibility

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:05.250
under pressure--
tremendously admired.

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:08.090
Now would you say that
translated in the tech sector,

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:10.430
is that something
that is important?

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:12.600
I see some nods.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:17.130
Many people told us in
fast-paced industries,

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:20.250
or industries where business
models are changing,

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:23.600
this is particularly valued.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:27.550
Interestingly, charisma
is number six, right?

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:28.640
A little down the list.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:32.940
People are suspect of big
personalities these days.

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:35.120
They prefer the calm confidence.

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:42.250
Number two-- decisiveness
showing teeth.

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:46.050
Now, when we look at
our mid-level employees,

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:49.580
we find that women have
a problem with this.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:54.080
That being tough,
being really forceful

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:58.500
can be hard for a female,
because she's seen often

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.170
times as a little unlikable.

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:05.080
The b-word gets rolled
out quite a bit.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.560
So this tough,
showing teeth thing

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:12.030
is actually easier for
men than for women.

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:16.060
And again, it reflects
the dominant culture,

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:19.170
the mainstream leaders, you
know, there's bias here.

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:24.420
This is how it's been done
by the dominant group, right?

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:25.700
So any reaction here?

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:29.590
Is it harder did you
feel, for a woman

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:36.940
to be super, strong minded and
remain someone who is admired?

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:39.730
You know, two weeks ago,
Jill Abramson was shot down

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:42.640
as the executive editor
of the New York Times.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:43.670
Why?

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:45.930
Well, we probably
read the press.

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:48.510
She was seen as pushy.

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:51.480
She was seen as abrasive.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:55.890
She was seen as lacking charm.

00:12:55.890 --> 00:13:01.830
She did not sufficiently make
nice to her, particularly,

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:04.730
senior male colleagues.

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:06.410
She was a fabulous leader.

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:08.820
No one was criticizing
her track record

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:12.290
or what she'd done in China.

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:15.750
So it is tough, particularly
in somewhat traditional fields,

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:17.280
perhaps.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.580
But if you look at number
four, it's fascinating.

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:23.440
Emotional intelligence--
this is where we find women

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.740
really do amazingly well.

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:29.950
There is more of
an empathy factor

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:33.610
that women are able to
get out there at work.

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:36.920
And these days-- why is
emotional intelligence

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:39.310
newly-prized,
newly on this list?

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:42.290
A lot of leaders said, look,
it's shooting up the charts.

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:46.450
Didn't used to be on
the list, but now it is.

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:49.676
So why is emotional
intelligence important

00:13:49.676 --> 00:13:50.800
if you want to be a leader?

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:58.560
Right, and your team is
probably diverse, right?

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:02.850
So sitting in someone else's
shoes-- pretty important.

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:08.050
And valuing difference--
pretty important.

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:10.570
The other thing we find is
that customers and clients can

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:12.810
be very diverse, they can
be very global these days.

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:14.980
Don't we all work
in global teams?

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:19.250
So a little empathy
builds trust.

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:22.100
And you can't just be the
top-down command and control

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:25.550
guy anymore, and have it work.

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:27.530
So in a way, this
is nicely mixed up.

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:30.950
Some of these prized
attributes are more natural

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:34.290
or perhaps more instinctual
for men, others for women.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.520
We don't know whether that's
socialization or really

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:37.220
how we are born.

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.080
But it's nevertheless true.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:43.070
And the thing that we
find in the final pick

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:50.130
here-- vision, yes, is
prized, but a measured vision.

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:53.370
One that you can
put data around,

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:57.190
one that you have a
lot of evidence around.

00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:59.670
The charisma bit-- which
is just turning people

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:05.430
on about your path forward--
does not work so well anymore.

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:11.880
So moving on, we asked
leaders, who is their icon?

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:16.540
Who brought up gravitas
better than anyone else?

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:20.360
Top choice was Mandela.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:24.750
We explored why
he was so admired.

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:28.850
He was thought to be
the complete package,

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:32.770
the extraordinary
integrity, force,

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:37.010
and vision of his journey,
the ways in which he

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:40.830
had earned leadership.

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:47.670
But also, his amazing
ability to understand

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:55.740
the power of symbolism, and to
connect on a very human level.

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:59.716
This particular episode
you probably-- well,

00:15:59.716 --> 00:16:01.590
maybe you'll all too
young to remember this--

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:05.700
but he was newly
president of South Africa.

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:09.190
The rugby team, The
Springboks, had just

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:11.730
won the world championship.

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:17.320
The Springboks team were
recalcitrant [? Afrikaans. ?]

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:21.890
100% of the team were
white South Africans--

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:26.030
from the [? Afrikaans ?] group,
which was the group that had

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:30.630
actually designed and
fought for apartheid.

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:34.330
So this was the group
that Nelson Mandela had

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:41.550
spent 23 years in jail
for, but they won.

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:44.900
South Africa was the champion.

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:50.400
So Mandela leaps out of the
stand, dons a Springbok jersey,

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.720
and hugs the captain.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:56.250
It's splashed around
the world, this image,

00:16:56.250 --> 00:17:00.250
because what it showed was
this new president was really

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:04.750
about reconciliation
and healing.

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:07.609
And this said it, right?

00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:13.020
This man had the most amazing
emotional intelligence, as well

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:18.300
as heft, as well as integrity.

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:21.150
Jamie Dimon's on
this list, Steve Jobs

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:23.569
is kind of on this
list, although he

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:25.750
was thought to be a
little suspect because

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:30.385
of just the eccentricity
of his personality.

00:17:30.385 --> 00:17:32.010
But it's an interesting
list, you know,

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:36.900
what leaders choose
as their icons.

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:38.760
The other thing we
find out from gravitas

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:41.050
is how does it go badly wrong?

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:44.050
How do you cut yourself
off at the knees

00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:48.860
so that, no matter how
good, you're out of here?

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.250
So you know, sexual
impropriety seems

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:57.040
to be a way in which
men hit the skids.

00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:01.205
Think of Petraeus or
Spitzer or Weiner or-- you

00:18:01.205 --> 00:18:04.580
know, Clinton was
impeached after all.

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:08.800
There is a way in
which senior man really

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:14.210
do know that this is a way
of getting written out.

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:19.840
But other behaviors
that get you in trouble

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:25.240
is lying, covering up.

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:29.890
The bully piece does not
get you anywhere these days.

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:33.130
It tends to, again, get
you crossed off the list.

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:36.930
An off-color or racially
insensitive set of remarks

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:38.790
will do the same.

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:43.970
Mitt Romney, famously,
was seen as someone

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:48.640
who had a tin ear-- was clueless
about how most people lived.

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.080
He was in this bubble.

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:53.220
He was such a privileged
man, he really

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:55.220
didn't know how
the world worked.

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:59.280
So he could talk about
having binders full of women

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:03.335
or he could tell the world
that 47% of the population

00:19:03.335 --> 00:19:07.740
were losers because
they were on benefits.

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:11.750
And he included veterans
and the disabled,

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:14.370
in terms of the
losers on his list.

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:15.800
In other words,
the reason he lost

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:21.170
that election was that he
was so profoundly insensitive

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:28.420
as to how other people lived
or what their challenges were.

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:31.070
And of course, Christie's in the
middle of a scandal right now.

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:32.670
He's seen as a bully.

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:35.820
He's seen as someone
who's trying to cover up.

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:39.440
And again, you can
see the blunders

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:44.200
as being elements
which will probably

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:50.120
ensure that he does not run
for president next time around.

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:51.980
So here are some tactics.

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:58.340
How do you deal with
some of these issues that

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:00.690
are problematic for you?

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:04.430
For instance, if
you're a woman, how

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:11.690
do you make your force,
your very strong opinions,

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:16.370
your track record really sing?

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:19.350
We did lots of interviews
for this research.

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:24.350
And maybe you sugar coat your
strength with some humor.

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:31.250
Or when you have a massively
important new campaign

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:33.620
that you totally
believe in, you also

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.280
go on some kind
of charm offensive

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:38.510
to make sure that people
find it palatable.

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:41.367
Maybe you do none of
the above because you

00:20:41.367 --> 00:20:45.380
know your non-negotiables,
and there's

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:52.430
no way in which you want
to bend your demeanor

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:59.200
or your approach to just
please the culture you're in.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:02.720
So I think we all
face tension here.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:07.110
Maybe we are willing
to bend at the margins.

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:14.440
If one is a man who's lived
in a pretty straight-arrow

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:19.420
environment, the way
you bend at the edges

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:25.980
are really listening for
bias in your environment,

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:31.250
and forcing yourself to
understand the other, right?

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:36.660
So again, we find that the
tension between authenticity

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:42.190
and conformity, between
standing in and standing out,

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:44.500
really permeates these things.

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:48.140
But by and large, women
do need to understand

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:52.770
that making their
strengths somehow

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:56.840
work for them is a
challenge in a lot

00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:59.290
of organizational cultures.

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:02.070
And for men, figuring
out how to show

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:13.100
empathy is again a commonplace
challenge in their team work.

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:16.200
The other thing
I want to say is,

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:22.600
if your reputation and the
word at the water cooler

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:29.700
precedes you, how do you
signal your reputation--

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:32.860
your stature-- in ways
that aren't annoying?

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:34.640
You're in a company,
I guess, which

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.680
doesn't have a whole
lot of titles, right?

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:43.670
So sometimes it's a little
hard to show your experience,

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:47.120
show your leaderly credentials.

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:49.940
So any ideas here
in terms of how

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:54.330
to, again, just
signal that gravitas,

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:57.530
somehow establish from
the get-go in a meeting

00:22:57.530 --> 00:22:59.780
that you know what
you're talking about,

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:04.420
that you have the chops?

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:06.310
Is that an issue at Google?

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:13.270
It is in a lot of young,
highly-geared companies.

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:16.910
If you are hired in, there's
this wonderful assumption

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:18.660
that, of course,
you're exceptional.

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:22.110
You're still faced with how
do you stand out at Google?

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:23.990
How do you progress?

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:26.810
How do you end up
by being tapped

00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:29.267
on the shoulder for
some major opportunity,

00:23:29.267 --> 00:23:30.850
because we know that
they're given out

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:35.580
not to everyone, but to
those who are seen as ready.

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:38.450
So I think this is true
of all organizations,

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:40.770
but I thought that was
very well expressed.

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:41.940
Thank you.

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:46.760
So let's move on and take
a look at communication.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:51.490
Because in some ways,
this is the way in.

00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:55.380
We find this is oftentimes
the ice breaker.

00:23:55.380 --> 00:24:01.580
So the top pick, and it's very
contemporary-- the ability

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:04.600
to have kind of
this mini-TED talk,

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:08.670
the concise,
compelling value-add.

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:10.912
Huge.

00:24:10.912 --> 00:24:17.650
And what we find is that
leaders particularly prize this

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:22.780
if you can do it seemingly
extemporaneously.

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:29.860
It's the kiss of death to rely
on notes or too many slides.

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:31.610
You've got to wing
it-- which goes

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:35.190
to your point-- this is
very hard to bring off.

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:42.110
Not only is it valued in
very fast-moving, incredibly

00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:45.730
talented cultures like
Google, but this is true

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:50.600
in media and on Wall Street,
you know, at Walmart.

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:54.730
I mean, this is a demand
of the modern workplace.

00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:57.600
Attention spans are short.

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:03.140
To find your voice,
to make it be heard,

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:07.750
the concise, compelling
thing is a must.

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:09.240
And it's not easy.

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:14.480
And again, my own story-- I
had some pretty terrible habits

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:15.270
12 years ago.

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:18.550
I had just spent a bunch
of years in academia

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:22.320
being a professor-- a
very boring professor

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:25.150
I think-- but I was
doing intermediate macro

00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:26.770
theory as my main thing, right?

00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:29.810
So hard to make that too lively.

00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:34.010
But here was the admired
style in my department.

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:36.870
You delivered information
in 50 minute chunks.

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:40.720
You snowed people
with evidence, right?

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:44.260
And very complex proofs.

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:46.286
Try that out on a book tour.

00:25:46.286 --> 00:25:47.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:50.500
SYLVIA ANN HEWLETT:
I was a disaster.

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:53.990
I couldn't do anything
without my notes.

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:58.940
So I made myself watch a
particularly bad interview

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:03.500
I did on Charlie Rose,
which was particularly

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:06.580
galling, because it was a big
chance to get my message out.

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:07.970
And I was terrible.

00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:10.170
I was just yawn-inducing.

00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:12.400
And I really was there with
my three-by-five cards.

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:15.200
You know, I could not
let go of the notes.

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:21.480
And I forced myself to
learn what was going on.

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:25.970
And did I practice,
practice like crazy.

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:32.230
And before I went to any
meeting or made any speech,

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:34.610
I banged it into my brain.

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:37.910
So I knew the arc of
what I was going to say.

00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:41.770
And I knew three
different versions,

00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:45.190
just in case the conversation
went in a different direction

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:48.920
or someone said what
I was about to say.

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:54.850
And I learned to tell
stories, not long stories.

00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:55.810
So it can be learned.

00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:57.060
All that stuff can be learned.

00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:02.650
But that is how you
get your confidence.

00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:05.260
This is why
communication is often

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:07.480
the way to build the
gravitas piece that we

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:10.080
were talking about earlier.

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:15.160
Because it establishes
your credibility.

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:17.370
And it ensures
that you're heard.

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:26.050
OK, so how do you move that into
the ability to command a space,

00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:28.990
a room-- whether it's a team
room or an audience-- and that

00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:33.490
is the linked one which is
at the top of the list here.

00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:35.580
This requires a
bunch of other things

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:42.120
which are actually the
surround sound is posture--

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.710
how do you sit at a table?

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:47.916
How do you stand in a space?

00:27:47.916 --> 00:27:50.290
Some of it is just, you know,
straightening that backbone

00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:55.360
and looking competent,
paying attention.

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:02.490
The other piece of
it is to let go all

00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:06.790
that which is between
you and your audience--

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:11.470
podiums, spectacles,
and again, notes--

00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:18.830
get rid of them-- and
devices-- eye contact,

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:20.760
eye contact, eye contact.

00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:27.679
So we find that
we're rolling out

00:28:27.679 --> 00:28:29.970
a whole bunch of high-touch
workshops, stuff like this,

00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:31.010
around EP.

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:36.530
This is where one can be
transformative, really rather

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:38.890
easily.

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:43.250
Any comments in terms of this
culture, what works here?

00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:44.500
Or what is problematic here?

00:28:47.386 --> 00:28:49.310
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:53.760
SYLVIA ANN HEWLETT: But
if you have in your mind

00:28:53.760 --> 00:29:00.280
a playbook of exactly
what you can say--

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:05.000
several versions of it--
which you know will grab,

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.321
it's easier to do that.

00:29:07.321 --> 00:29:09.570
AUDIENCE: So manipulation
of that general conversation

00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:10.670
gets--

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:12.045
SYLVIA ANN HEWLETT:
So isn't this

00:29:12.045 --> 00:29:16.070
a brilliant example of having
your emotional intelligence

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:18.250
connect with your
communication skills?

00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:19.730
Because you know
that the leaders

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:23.230
need to take ownership
of this idea.

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:25.110
You've got to prod them along.

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:27.640
You've got to become
indispensable.

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:29.900
And you've certainly got
to be value add, right?

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:39.400
But this can be transformative
of one's-- how you see, right?

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:45.800
And of your own confidence.

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:51.430
OK, so moving on, what
was the top pick here?

00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:53.470
Interestingly, a woman.

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:55.640
Sheryl, of course, we all now.

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:58.610
Not only is she seen as someone
of enormous credibility,

00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:00.830
but her communication
skills, right?

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:03.910
She did do that TED talk, right?

00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:06.320
One of the most-- I think
it was the most watched TED

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:07.940
talk that particular year.

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:13.810
Because she has this ability
of delivering a clear message

00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:19.490
and then revealing some
of her own vulnerability,

00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:22.240
so you can relate to her.

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:25.730
She would be obnoxious
if she did not do that.

00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:30.230
Because this is a person
who's had a golden path.

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:32.990
How do we relate to
someone like that?

00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:35.870
But she tells us, you know,
that she put on 60 pounds

00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:38.610
with that first child and
some of her struggles.

00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:40.920
I mean, you can reveal
any part of you.

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:42.830
It doesn't have to,
obviously, be family.

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:44.980
You probably
shouldn't over-share.

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:50.680
But this is part of
empathy-- sharing our roots,

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:54.330
sharing a little
piece of failure.

00:30:54.330 --> 00:31:00.240
And it makes her someone
that people want to hear.

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:03.820
And this other thing about the
blunders-- because again, we

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:06.660
did look at the
blunders-- we see, again,

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:08.710
bias all over these blunders.

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:13.580
The interesting thing about
bias is that executive presence

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:17.150
is, oftentimes, the place
where you see bias revealed.

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:23.940
Because you're talking about
a leadership archetype, right,

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:29.010
that crying-- take crying--
turns out, men can cry,

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:33.400
women cannot in the workplace.

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:38.410
Think of Obama's speech
around Trayvon Martin.

00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:42.900
He let a few tears
leak out of his eyes.

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:45.020
We liked him for that.

00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:48.430
It showed that this
really distant man

00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:53.730
had heart and connected to the
tragedy of this young person's

00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:55.130
life.

00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:58.820
But when women cry
in public, they're

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:01.500
seen as just way
too emotional-- who

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:04.650
can deal with them
kind of thing.

00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:10.040
It takes us down in our stature.

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:12.140
So if we look at
this list, we know

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:19.390
that we want a world where
there isn't so much bias, such

00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:22.520
a gendered, for
instance, take on what

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:24.960
leadership needs to look like.

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.320
But this is what's happening
this week, next week,

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:27.990
last week.

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:29.240
This is how people are judged.

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:35.220
Because this is data in terms
of what leaders right now find

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:37.770
does not work.

00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:39.870
One thing which I find
particularly interesting--

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:45.340
the number one blunder is
constant device checking.

00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:51.250
Leaders find that profoundly
discourteous and profoundly

00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:54.680
undermining of a
more junior person's

00:32:54.680 --> 00:33:02.910
gravitas, that they are not
able to pay full attention.

00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:08.034
So what is the deal at
Google, because I think--

00:33:08.034 --> 00:33:10.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:14.620
--some of the valued devices
must be so omnipresent.

00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:19.180
But is there a kind of
unwritten etiquette here,

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:21.990
in terms of what
happens in key meetings?

00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:24.290
AUDIENCE: Most of the
meetings are no wifi--

00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:30.458
SYLVIA ANN HEWLETT:
What about iPhones?

00:33:30.458 --> 00:33:33.060
I'm looking at someone
who's holding theirs.

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:36.940
Well maybe it's not an
iPhone, maybe it's an Android.

00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:46.020
So tell me what the
dominant behavior is.

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:52.490
But if it gets in
the way of you making

00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:58.800
eye contact with your boss and
weighing in with your power

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:04.030
sort, and doing the
clever stuff of linking

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:09.080
your emotional sense of who
is really needing to buy-in,

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:12.449
in this meeting, to my idea,
and how do I demonstrate

00:34:12.449 --> 00:34:19.889
my indispensability to
this project going forward,

00:34:19.889 --> 00:34:22.730
it truly does get in the way.

00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:25.300
No, no, no, no,
I'm not saying you

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:27.530
personally, don't
feel it as an attack.

00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:29.719
You see, what leaders
say-- no matter

00:34:29.719 --> 00:34:31.420
what the technology,
no matter what

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:35.020
the value-add of
being able to complete

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:39.350
your sense of some link
or whatever-- the most

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:50.320
important activity-- the
main goal-- of a meeting

00:34:50.320 --> 00:35:01.230
is to leave it having impressed,
having pushed the ball forward,

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:09.080
and having a newly central
role in whatever was decided.

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:12.720
So I mean, I do feel-- I
mean, I have five kids,

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:16.600
so I am in touch
with-- I mean, I

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:19.530
don't tend to use devices
that much, because of my age.

00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:20.040
Right?

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:24.850
You know, it's not a
habit I ever developed.

00:35:24.850 --> 00:35:27.270
But I do feel that there
is a way in which we

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:30.790
can undermine ourselves.

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:34.320
And one thing that is valued
above all other things

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:43.270
by senior leaders is eye contact
and having the full attention

00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:47.200
of a younger person they value.

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.860
OK.

00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:54.340
So some more or less humorous
examples of what people feel

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:57.900
has gone wrong in terms of
public displays of this--

00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:01.360
Tim Geithner, famously,
cannot make eye contact.

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:04.130
He's always accused of
looking like a frightened

00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:09.210
teenager, because he
deflects eye contact.

00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:11.840
He almost cannot do it.

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:16.460
Tremendously undermined
his credibility.

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:18.590
And the forcefulness,
assertiveness,

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:23.300
of statements coming from women
of color really on display,

00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:25.920
I think, with Indra Nooyi.

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:28.800
She gave a very famous speech
not long ago at the Columbia

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:33.510
Business School, where she
took on American arrogance

00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:34.990
in the world.

00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:39.710
She was coming from
a very secure place.

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:42.150
She was born and
brought up in India.

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:45.810
She's been a very
successful, global executive.

00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:48.890
And she is CEO of Pepsi.

00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:53.460
But because she is
a woman of color,

00:36:53.460 --> 00:37:00.301
she got trashed by the
press, particularly

00:37:00.301 --> 00:37:05.940
by white-guy reporters
who saw her as out of line

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:12.030
for criticizing a country
that she had done so well in.

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:15.030
So again, the degree
of forcefulness,

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:19.000
the degree of edginess, you
can show as a woman of color

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.140
really constrained by
bias, by these stereotypes,

00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:27.580
and the archetypes
of the leadership.

00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:33.290
OK, so we all know this, that
80% meet you first time online.

00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:35.270
And you'd better
make sure that you're

00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:40.150
very happy with your
LinkedIn manifestations,

00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:43.880
and that you're showing
up online in ways

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:45.850
that you're proud of.

00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:48.750
This is where
colleagues and bosses--

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:50.950
where folks who are
perhaps interviewing you

00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:55.420
for an opportunity-- will
really first meet you.

00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:59.660
And I'm sure you all know
that very profoundly here.

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:04.555
So a few tactics--
first, lose the props.

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:10.500
Get rid of the
security blankets.

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:14.450
We find that women use
about one-third more

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:17.420
PowerPoint slides than men.

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:19.690
Because women often
times feel that they

00:38:19.690 --> 00:38:23.630
have to show that they're super
well-prepared, that they really

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:25.680
did do all their homework.

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.690
Often times, they feel that
there are very few of them

00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:30.870
around a table, particularly
at more senior levels,

00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:34.990
so they have to
show how much work

00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:37.890
they put it into
this presentation.

00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:39.780
But what it does,
it undermines them,

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:44.800
because you do, above all, need
to show that you can wing it,

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:48.280
that you know your stuff cold.

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:50.631
Eye contact.

00:38:50.631 --> 00:38:53.450
Lower your voice--
this is interesting.

00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:57.240
Voices go up under
pressure, under stress.

00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:08.870
Keeping obvious control--
not speeding up, not

00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:12.680
lifting your voice--
very important in terms

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:13.910
of being heard.

00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:18.560
We've been using some opera
coaches in the workshops

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:22.320
we are doing around EP,
and it's fascinating

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:27.520
how much you can manipulate
your voice so as you're heard.

00:39:29.834 --> 00:39:31.750
And again, it's got
nothing to do with accent.

00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:35.110
Most opera singers don't
speak any of languages

00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:37.820
very well that they sing in.

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:42.970
It's all about tone
and projection.

00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:46.257
And the last one-- use
silence as a weapon.

00:39:46.257 --> 00:39:48.090
It's probably a little
hard to do at Google,

00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:55.460
because you're describing a very
crowded meeting culture, where

00:39:55.460 --> 00:40:00.580
people are fighting
for space, right?

00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:03.070
But in some cultures--
and on Wall Street

00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:06.160
is a very good example--
I did an amazing interview

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:08.180
with Sally Krawcheck,
who was head

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:10.240
of Merrill Lynch for many years.

00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:13.190
She said that, as
a Southern woman,

00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:20.430
she was brought up to fill
all space with words--

00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:25.590
chitter-chat-- because
a nice girl was supposed

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:28.560
to make everyone else
feel comfortable.

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:30.880
And science was awkward.

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:35.030
So she made it her business
to fill up all space.

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:39.060
She was totally
discounted on Wall Street,

00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:40.800
because chitter-chatter
in Southern women

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:44.090
don't make much impact.

00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:49.060
So what she learned to do was
become much more economical

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:51.210
in what she said.

00:40:51.210 --> 00:40:52.860
And she was audacious.

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:55.270
I mean this was a woman
who did not take prisoners,

00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:58.220
in terms of her viewpoints.

00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:06.110
But she learned to surround
her very important thoughts

00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:12.440
with silence, to deliberately
make people feel awkward,

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:15.910
so that they actually listened.

00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:17.570
So there's all kinds of tools.

00:41:17.570 --> 00:41:19.560
But it's a performance.

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:24.670
This is something that
we can all manipulate.

00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:30.920
And in a way, this isn't bias.

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:37.760
This is how you've get
your voice to count.

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:40.500
Which is why I see the
communication thing as the way

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:42.000
in.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.640
Too many of the
demands are growing

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:49.240
competence and credibility.

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:51.880
OK, turning to appearance--
this is the least important,

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:58.000
it's about 7% of what
leaders say as important.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.090
Very good news here,
grooming and polish

00:42:02.090 --> 00:42:04.610
and being appropriate.

00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:08.180
So much more important than
the sheer size of your body,

00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:12.460
or the texture of your
hair, or you know,

00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:15.375
exactly what's happening
to the clothing style

00:42:15.375 --> 00:42:19.420
that you choose to wear.

00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:22.780
So what is grooming and polish?

00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:28.075
We find, again, in the data that
seemingly casual cultures can

00:42:28.075 --> 00:42:32.630
be actually harder to figure
out than formal cultures.

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:35.520
And there are weird tripwires.

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:39.850
For instance, remember the IPO
of Facebook-- all the hoodie,

00:42:39.850 --> 00:42:42.170
schlumpy, nerdy people?

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:44.590
And then they were Sheryl
Sandberg, looking quite formal.

00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:47.800
Because it's hard to do
the hoodie thing and look

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:51.430
leaderly if you're a woman.

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:54.200
It's pretty easy to look like
a graduate student or someone's

00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:55.270
assistant.

00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:58.680
In other words, it
is surprisingly tough

00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:02.940
to negotiate casual cultures
and somehow crack it,

00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:06.670
because there are
admired styles,

00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:11.810
even though there would
seem to be few rules.

00:43:11.810 --> 00:43:14.660
One thing that I
experienced last summer

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:20.090
is, I was invited
to the advertising

00:43:20.090 --> 00:43:22.489
celebration in Cannes.

00:43:22.489 --> 00:43:24.280
where they give the
awards in the industry.

00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:27.470
It's called the
Cannes Lions Awards.

00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:31.330
And it's a little like
1963 in that only 3%

00:43:31.330 --> 00:43:37.540
of the creative directors in
the top 50 advertising companies

00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:38.390
are female.

00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:41.120
This is largely a male crowd.

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:44.680
It's the rock stars, you know,
giving each other awards.

00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:46.530
And it's profoundly male.

00:43:46.530 --> 00:43:51.100
So you walk in, and you try and
figure out what the look is.

00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:53.450
And it hits you
between the eyes.

00:43:53.450 --> 00:44:00.906
There was almost a uniform--
four-day-old stubble was in.

00:44:00.906 --> 00:44:03.540
I mean, they did not
have a whole lot of hair

00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:07.150
on their heads, so they were
trying to look virile, I think.

00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:12.460
And then there were
the bespoke shorts,

00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:17.740
the incredibly expensive
watches, and flip flops.

00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:20.630
That was it.

00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:23.690
The few women in the room
did not know what to do.

00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:26.730
I mean, they couldn't quite
do the stubble thing--

00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:30.060
that wouldn't have done
them much good, right?

00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:33.670
And you know, the
short thing is hard,

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:36.420
because most-- these were
people in their 50's, they

00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:38.440
were at the pinnacle
of their careers.

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:41.210
Most women don't look that
great in shorts when they're 50.

00:44:41.210 --> 00:44:42.960
Well, the men didn't
either, but you know.

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:44.382
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:44.382 --> 00:44:45.840
SYLVIA ANN HEWLETT:
So I guess what

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:51.380
I'm trying to say is that
there was a code in this room,

00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:55.850
but it was a tough one,
a really tough one.

00:44:55.850 --> 00:45:01.110
So again, what we say is find
yourself some role models.

00:45:01.110 --> 00:45:04.760
Find what works in
your micro-climate,

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:08.460
because I imagine that
tech and sales and HR have

00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:12.097
different demands
even at Google.

00:45:12.097 --> 00:45:13.680
Because you've got
to get rid of this.

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:16.910
I mean, it's not very
important, but it's good

00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:18.930
not to have this
get in your way.

00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:20.580
Because the thing
about appearance--

00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:23.810
it's the first filter, right?

00:45:23.810 --> 00:45:27.490
If you get it profoundly
wrong, and turn up

00:45:27.490 --> 00:45:31.045
looking like Hillary Clinton
in your pantsuit at Cannes,

00:45:31.045 --> 00:45:33.350
it would not do you much good.

00:45:33.350 --> 00:45:35.630
So it's not that in
the end it's important,

00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:39.030
but it is surprisingly tricky.

00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:44.830
So again, admired folks in
terms of the well-put-together

00:45:44.830 --> 00:45:47.480
piece-- Christine
Lagarde's thought

00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:50.730
to be the very elegant
executive woman.

00:45:50.730 --> 00:45:54.230
It's great that she's
allowed to have white hair.

00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:56.030
And then of course
Ken Chenault is

00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:58.330
hugely admired for his style.

00:45:58.330 --> 00:46:02.430
And we find that
the other thing that

00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:06.820
was a big tip from this work is
that looking as though you're

00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:10.410
toned and fit is very important.

00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:11.870
It's actually much
more important

00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:19.310
than say being physically
attractive in some chocolate

00:46:19.310 --> 00:46:20.769
box way.

00:46:20.769 --> 00:46:22.310
You've got to look
as though you have

00:46:22.310 --> 00:46:24.410
some resilience these days.

00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:26.670
Jobs are demanding.

00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:28.840
To show you that you
actually work out,

00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:31.260
and you can deal
with the travel,

00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:33.210
and deal with the
long work weeks,

00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:37.290
you are signaling
vigor and resilience.

00:46:37.290 --> 00:46:38.018
Yes?

00:46:38.018 --> 00:46:40.650
AUDIENCE: Isn't that just a
code for not being [INAUDIBLE]?

00:46:40.650 --> 00:46:42.941
SYLVIA ANN HEWLETT: No, no,
it's interesting, it's not.

00:46:42.941 --> 00:46:44.930
We tested that.

00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:46.600
And it was
particularly important

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:51.190
for African American
talent that we test that.

00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:54.180
We are very forgiving, I
mean within some limit.

00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:56.220
Being obese is not a good idea.

00:46:56.220 --> 00:47:00.130
But if you are clearly looking
after yourself and fit,

00:47:00.130 --> 00:47:06.400
there's a big range, which
is actually very good news.

00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:09.300
And then finally, the weird
way in which women really

00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:12.490
are scrutinized more than man.

00:47:12.490 --> 00:47:16.350
700 people were invited
to look at these pictures

00:47:16.350 --> 00:47:19.270
for 250 milliseconds.

00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:22.850
And 86% of them
decided so very quickly

00:47:22.850 --> 00:47:26.530
which one of these-- one,
two, three, or four--

00:47:26.530 --> 00:47:31.530
was the most competent,
the most leaderly.

00:47:31.530 --> 00:47:33.127
Which number?

00:47:33.127 --> 00:47:33.710
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:47:33.710 --> 00:47:34.376
AUDIENCE: Three.

00:47:34.376 --> 00:47:35.380
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:37.860
SYLVIA ANN HEWLETT: Four.

00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:43.580
She was seen as being in
control, having it together.

00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:47.210
Number one got no marks.

00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:51.427
But when asked, which one
is the most trustworthy?

00:47:51.427 --> 00:47:52.680
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:55.140
SYLVIA ANN HEWLETT: Two won out.

00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:59.150
So it's treacherous, right?

00:47:59.150 --> 00:48:04.880
Wouldn't you want to be a
competent, trustworthy leader?

00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:06.650
And then just remind
ourselves, you know,

00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:08.400
men don't have to deal
with this it's all.

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:09.980
Unless you're a
TV anchor, you're

00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:11.480
not in the business of make-up.

00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:14.110
So women do gets
scrutinized more.

00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:19.100
So that's that data, and
I'm just going to end with

00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:20.865
In this last slide.

00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:27.450
Women and also people of
color-- multicultural folks--

00:48:27.450 --> 00:48:32.040
have little latitude-- less
latitude-- than the mainstream

00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:33.880
leader type.

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:36.290
Now, again, the power
of bias, the power

00:48:36.290 --> 00:48:40.590
of the existing
models of leadership.

00:48:40.590 --> 00:48:46.100
So it's very easy to be seen as
too provocative, too dowdy, too

00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:48.960
pushy, too self-depreciating.

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:52.540
The one I love is
too young, too old.

00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:55.880
As a woman, very easy to be seen
as too inexperienced and not

00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:57.080
ready.

00:48:57.080 --> 00:49:00.920
But also easy to be seen
as over-the-hill, right?

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:04.780
There are three years in
there when we're just right.

00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:07.460
Men as a whole get 17 years.

00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:09.250
So there is.

00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:13.120
There's gendered thing going on.

00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:18.940
And clearly this does feed
so much into the amazing work

00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:20.660
that Google is doing on bias.

00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:26.030
Because there is a need
to widen and make more

00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:34.390
inclusive how we see leadership,
in terms of how we act,

00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:38.300
how we speak, and how we look.

00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:40.490
But if we're interested in
dealing with figuring out

00:49:40.490 --> 00:49:47.000
how to succeed this week,
this data is pretty important.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.200
So thank you.

00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:50.670
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:57.530 --> 00:49:59.880
AUDIENCE: My question is
around the make-up piece.

00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:03.330
Since there is
conflicting evidence,

00:50:03.330 --> 00:50:05.860
what would you do,
if you were a woman,

00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:09.572
in terms of what amount of
make-up that you would wear?

00:50:09.572 --> 00:50:11.280
SYLVIA ANN HEWLETT:
I think it's the kind

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:13.130
of well-put-together
thing, you know,

00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:15.842
a kind of good version of you.

00:50:15.842 --> 00:50:17.850
You certainly don't
want to come over

00:50:17.850 --> 00:50:21.950
as someone quite
different-- faking

00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:25.120
some persona is not a good idea.

00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:28.130
But it does seem to
get marks for effort.

00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:35.250
It's good to show
that you have put

00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:39.420
some energy into looking good.

00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:42.880
It shows respect for yourself,
respect for the team,

00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:47.620
and perhaps respect
for the stakeholders.

00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:50.650
Dishevelment, both
men and women,

00:50:50.650 --> 00:50:56.200
you get-- and I think it was
given as part of the example.

00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:59.910
You've got to look as though
you didn't just fall out of bed,

00:50:59.910 --> 00:51:09.350
that you put some effort
into showing up ready.

00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:12.690
AUDIENCE: So is making sound,
informed decisions something

00:51:12.690 --> 00:51:16.290
that leaders just
don't consider?

00:51:16.290 --> 00:51:20.100
SYLVIA ANN HEWLETT:
That is performance.

00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:23.050
This is not performance.

00:51:23.050 --> 00:51:27.180
This is how you signal,
what you telegraph,

00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:33.380
in terms of how you
act, speak, and look.

00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:37.000
Judgment calls--
incredibly important.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.940
There's another ton of
books on that, right?

00:51:39.940 --> 00:51:43.285
This is about your image.

00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:48.610
But it's about
30% of everything.

00:51:48.610 --> 00:51:53.100
Because it does allow
you to be tapped

00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:56.490
on the shoulder for
some big opportunity.

00:51:56.490 --> 00:51:57.990
You then might screw up, right?

00:51:57.990 --> 00:52:01.340
You don't deliver the right
stuff in terms of performance,

00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:06.340
in terms of the
great judgment calls.

00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:11.160
But how would you stand
apart from the crowd,

00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:13.610
how would you get singled
out in the first place,

00:52:13.610 --> 00:52:18.060
and given the shot
at a big opportunity.

00:52:20.579 --> 00:52:22.370
No, I'm not trying to
say that there aren't

00:52:22.370 --> 00:52:28.230
some fundamental performance
elements that, in the end,

00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:31.080
will fuel your journey,
but this is really

00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:36.760
about the telegraphing
of confidence,

00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:43.700
the ability to be compelling
about what you have to say,

00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:50.500
and the ability to look the part
enough so that you don't get

00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:53.950
knocked off the list because
of the fact you've got soup

00:52:53.950 --> 00:52:55.680
on your tie, or I
don't know what.

00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:59.640
You know, there's a lot
of things that you could--

00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:04.290
no ties, soup on your
t-shirt-- who knows.

00:53:04.290 --> 00:53:08.510
There are very culturally
specific things.

00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:12.640
And if I were to choose
my category of what really

00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:21.875
is magical, in turbo
charging progression,

00:53:21.875 --> 00:53:23.390
it is the communication piece.

00:53:27.150 --> 00:53:28.090
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:28.090 --> 00:53:29.380
SYLVIA ANN HEWLETT: Yes, no.

00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:31.860
Totally, totally.

00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:34.430
And it needs to be
evolved, always,

00:53:34.430 --> 00:53:40.600
because the demands
of the era change.

00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:42.880
AUDIENCE: You gave the
example of Sheryl Sandberg,

00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:45.330
and how she shares
personal anecdotes just

00:53:45.330 --> 00:53:46.700
to relate to people better.

00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:50.940
Do you feel that if women
share their personal stories

00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:54.535
about their families, they will
come across as more emotional.

00:53:56.306 --> 00:53:58.430
SYLVIA ANN HEWLETT: You
know, that's a great story.

00:53:58.430 --> 00:54:02.730
You can over-share and
it's not a good idea

00:54:02.730 --> 00:54:04.620
to wear your family
on your sleeve.

00:54:07.490 --> 00:54:13.340
That tends to
undermine your edge,

00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:17.500
because there's a lot of
bias around working moms.

00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:19.050
But I'll tell you the story.

00:54:19.050 --> 00:54:22.690
I interviewed someone who
is head of the global card

00:54:22.690 --> 00:54:26.360
division of American
Express last week.

00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:28.820
He's African American.

00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:33.000
He was wresting
with the challenge

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.040
of connecting to
his global team.

00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:40.540
His team is spread
around 52 countries.

00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:46.640
And obviously much of
his contact is virtual.

00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:54.660
He is seen as an enormously
effective leader.

00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:57.860
He is much beloved.

00:54:57.860 --> 00:54:59.446
I wanted to know how he did it.

00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:17.170
He understands the importance
of being known to his key people

00:55:17.170 --> 00:55:18.300
around the world.

00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:24.730
So he goes to every market once
a quarter and does a town hall.

00:55:24.730 --> 00:55:27.630
He also does
monthly phone calls,

00:55:27.630 --> 00:55:35.970
so that it's not just email
and really abstract kind

00:55:35.970 --> 00:55:37.340
of connection.

00:55:37.340 --> 00:55:41.480
So I said, well, what do
you do at these town halls,

00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:43.650
or what do you do
on those calls, that

00:55:43.650 --> 00:55:47.824
make you so beloved?

00:55:47.824 --> 00:55:50.490
I'll bet he's a great performer,
and he does all the other stuff

00:55:50.490 --> 00:55:55.690
too, but he's seen as someone
you want to go work for.

00:55:55.690 --> 00:56:01.250
He tells stories for
the first three minutes.

00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:04.430
Not a whole bunch of time,
there's a lot of business

00:56:04.430 --> 00:56:06.580
that needs to get done,
right, in these very

00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:09.710
precious one-hour phone calls.

00:56:09.710 --> 00:56:13.340
He said, for instance, he
did a call out of London.

00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:16.410
And the BAFTA Awards
were just going on.

00:56:16.410 --> 00:56:18.790
He loves movies.

00:56:18.790 --> 00:56:24.100
So he told why he was totally
rooting for this movie

00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:27.280
and invited folks to get
back to him on this movie.

00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:32.000
And give him some sense
of what they loved, too.

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.610
And he said, look,
it's so simple,

00:56:34.610 --> 00:56:39.740
but the fact that they knew that
I kind of totally screwed up

00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:42.190
the weekend because I had
to see all these movies,

00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:47.620
it made him human in a
way that was very, very

00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:50.850
important in building trust.

00:56:50.850 --> 00:56:52.630
Sometimes it's a little
deeper than that.

00:56:52.630 --> 00:56:56.570
For instance, he grew up
in the projects of Oakland,

00:56:56.570 --> 00:57:00.090
and the first legs of his
career were full of struggle.

00:57:00.090 --> 00:57:03.430
He'll share a little
piece of that.

00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:07.400
Not much, because you don't
want to kiss all-- kiss-and-tell

00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:10.550
all kind of thing--
that's not going to work.

00:57:10.550 --> 00:57:17.590
You need to stay in the
business strategic world.

00:57:17.590 --> 00:57:19.770
So oftentimes, it's not family.

00:57:19.770 --> 00:57:21.830
It can be roots,
it can be passions,

00:57:21.830 --> 00:57:25.810
but to reveal another
dimension of yourself

00:57:25.810 --> 00:57:29.520
is this empathy thing.

00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:34.920
And allows-- he said, then
people read his emails

00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:36.110
with a different mindset.

00:57:36.110 --> 00:57:37.865
They think they know him.

00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:46.580
So there are things that
are quite simple that

00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:54.075
create an aura of
your ability to lead.

00:57:54.075 --> 00:57:55.450
AUDIENCE: Just a
bit of a comment

00:57:55.450 --> 00:57:56.450
on what you were saying.

00:57:56.450 --> 00:58:00.170
I think that the sharing thing
really shows you as a leader,

00:58:00.170 --> 00:58:02.770
but when you're lowish
in the organization

00:58:02.770 --> 00:58:05.849
and you're looking up, sharing
is not generally very valuable.

00:58:05.849 --> 00:58:07.515
SYLVIA ANN HEWLETT:
That's a very good--

00:58:07.515 --> 00:58:08.720
that's a very wise point.

00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:10.800
AUDIENCE: It actually goes
against your gravitas.

00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:12.216
SYLVIA ANN HEWLETT:
But you see, I

00:58:12.216 --> 00:58:16.530
think that it's not two worlds.

00:58:16.530 --> 00:58:22.020
Many people in this room
both lead small teams

00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:25.680
and are junior in
other contexts.

00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:28.990
And it's the rare
person who doesn't

00:58:28.990 --> 00:58:32.300
have a sphere of influence.

00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:33.340
But you're right.

00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:36.380
It is particularly
magical coming

00:58:36.380 --> 00:58:38.560
from someone who is senior.

00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:41.450
AUDIENCE: I think at Google
I feel a lot more comfortable

00:58:41.450 --> 00:58:46.419
being myself in sharing
more than I have elsewhere,

00:58:46.419 --> 00:58:48.210
because there's just
generally more respect

00:58:48.210 --> 00:58:51.810
and people treat each
other really well.

00:58:51.810 --> 00:58:54.740
But I just still have a
question about, as a woman,

00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:56.370
being able to share things.

00:58:56.370 --> 00:58:59.490
Because I've seen these
things done very badly.

00:58:59.490 --> 00:59:03.660
So is there a bad way
to share information

00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:06.620
about-- so that you're bringing
your whole person to work,

00:59:06.620 --> 00:59:09.430
as opposed to having
completely different personas

00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:12.005
of work and your personal life?

00:59:12.005 --> 00:59:13.630
SYLVIA ANN HEWLETT:
One type of sharing

00:59:13.630 --> 00:59:20.465
which is incredibly effective
is how you get feedback.

00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:26.110
Again in the data,
we find that very

00:59:26.110 --> 00:59:28.869
few high-potential,
younger people

00:59:28.869 --> 00:59:29.910
get unvarnished feedback.

00:59:32.610 --> 00:59:35.410
Senior folks can't be
bothered, they avoid it,

00:59:35.410 --> 00:59:39.870
it can be embarrassing to give
honest feedback sometimes,

00:59:39.870 --> 00:59:43.470
particularly across
lines of gender or race.

00:59:43.470 --> 00:59:45.910
So it doesn't happen.

00:59:45.910 --> 00:59:49.530
It happens between mini-mes.

00:59:49.530 --> 00:59:56.000
Again, straight, Caucasian
guys from the right schools

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.600
do a lot of sharing
on the feedback front.

00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:03.810
But oftentimes, at a
very diverse workplace,

01:00:03.810 --> 01:00:06.140
very little feedback happens.

01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:08.260
And we've got a lot
of data on this.

01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:15.930
So how do you get feedback,
and how do you give it?

01:00:15.930 --> 01:00:21.190
And revealing some
of your aspiration--

01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:30.250
some of your sense of where
you see your journey going--

01:00:30.250 --> 01:00:33.210
is magical in this regard.

01:00:33.210 --> 01:00:38.195
If a younger person says to
a supervisor, or a mentor,

01:00:38.195 --> 01:00:43.580
or a sponsor, or a manager,
"I'm giving this presentation

01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:46.180
next week.

01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:47.530
I'm really white hot.

01:00:47.530 --> 01:00:50.240
I think I can nail this.

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:53.380
But there are two
areas where I feel

01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:55.800
I could do some fine tuning.

01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:58.890
Can you listen, and pay
attention, and give me

01:00:58.890 --> 01:01:01.130
feedback?"

01:01:01.130 --> 01:01:03.170
I mean, there's
ways of presenting

01:01:03.170 --> 01:01:05.690
this that do not
make you vulnerable.

01:01:05.690 --> 01:01:08.080
I mean you're saying
look, I got it.

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:08.810
I'm excited.

01:01:08.810 --> 01:01:10.380
I'm going to do it well.

01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:15.600
But please pay attention to
this, that, or the other thing.

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:18.680
It opens the door to the
most amazing useful feedback.

01:01:21.790 --> 01:01:26.780
And similarly, you can
do that about the way

01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:30.390
you present yourself
in other ways.

01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:32.750
And the older person, or
the more senior person,

01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:36.810
feels permission to be real.

01:01:36.810 --> 01:01:39.350
And of course
that's how you grow.

01:01:39.350 --> 01:01:40.450
Thank you so much.

01:01:40.450 --> 01:01:42.310
Amazing conversation.

01:01:42.310 --> 01:01:43.430
Enjoyed the questions.

01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:47.380
[APPLAUSE]
