will know that we have moved our samples

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300
will know that we have moved our samples
 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.359
will know that we have moved our samples
away from code google com to github com

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:27.369

check us out and this is what are some

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460
check us out and this is what are some
 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.030
check us out and this is what are some
of our github samples look like and this

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040
of our github samples look like and this
 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.130
of our github samples look like and this
is right here that's a Java sample this

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140
is right here that's a Java sample this
 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.510
is right here that's a Java sample this
is the right page you should be looking

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520
is the right page you should be looking
 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.850
is the right page you should be looking
at so if we click through to the Java

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860
at so if we click through to the Java
 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.549
at so if we click through to the Java
sample one thing that you usually want

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559
sample one thing that you usually want
 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.040
sample one thing that you usually want
to keep up to date if you want to keep

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050
to keep up to date if you want to keep
 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.950
to keep up to date if you want to keep
up to date with new API s is the version

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960
up to date with new API s is the version
 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.650
up to date with new API s is the version
of the Java API client is using so one

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660
of the Java API client is using so one
 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.360
of the Java API client is using so one
way you can do this is by looking in

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370
way you can do this is by looking in
 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.200
way you can do this is by looking in
maven and looking at pom.xml and I'm

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210
maven and looking at pom.xml and I'm
 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.850
maven and looking at pom.xml and I'm
going to blow this up real quick you'll

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860
going to blow this up real quick you'll
 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.529
going to blow this up real quick you'll
see that there's a youtube version and a

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:10.539
see that there's a youtube version and a
 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:12.930
see that there's a youtube version and a
YouTube analytics version and this is a

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940
YouTube analytics version and this is a
 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.370
YouTube analytics version and this is a
really good way to make sure that you

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380
really good way to make sure that you
 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.139
really good way to make sure that you
download code that will definitely work

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149
download code that will definitely work
 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:19.440
download code that will definitely work
is by copying the samples but what if

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450
is by copying the samples but what if
 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.820
is by copying the samples but what if
we're not always keeping the samples up

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830
we're not always keeping the samples up
 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.219
we're not always keeping the samples up
to date what if we release a new API and

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229
to date what if we release a new API and
 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.199
to date what if we release a new API and
the samples they might lag a few days

00:01:25.199 --> 00:01:25.209
the samples they might lag a few days
 

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:27.600
the samples they might lag a few days
but you need that API right away how do

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610
but you need that API right away how do
 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.790
but you need that API right away how do
you know what the newest version of the

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800
you know what the newest version of the
 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.529
you know what the newest version of the
API client library is well it's not on

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:34.539
API client library is well it's not on
 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:36.930
API client library is well it's not on
the Java code samples page but there's a

the YouTube analytics API as well as a
 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.420
the YouTube analytics API as well as a
data API so I'm going to go ahead and

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430
data API so I'm going to go ahead and
 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.920

scroll down and you can download the

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530
scroll down and you can download the
 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.350
scroll down and you can download the
client library but usually the best way

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360
client library but usually the best way
 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.820
client library but usually the best way
is probably the use of builds is like

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830
is probably the use of builds is like
 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.070
is probably the use of builds is like
maven or Gradle because there's lots of

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080
maven or Gradle because there's lots of
 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.840
maven or Gradle because there's lots of
dependencies that library depends on so

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850
dependencies that library depends on so
 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.450
dependencies that library depends on so
click on a maven tab and you'll see what

samples up to date on that now let's
 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.070
samples up to date on that now let's
just make sure analytics API samples

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080
just make sure analytics API samples
 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.310
