00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.670
When you learned about storytelling in school,

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.030
you probably learned that good stories have a predictable arc.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.930
They typically start out with an introduction, followed by a rising action,

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.890
a climax, and finish with a final resolution.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.079
This is the way storytelling has been done for years and works well in

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:20.940
a variety of formats such as oral and written stories in TVs and movies.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.980
The dawn of new mediums, namely computers and the Internet, have given rise to

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.390
new narrative structures that can often be much more nuanced and complex.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.666
Let's first talk about author-driven narratives.

00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:36.070
Author-driven narratives typically have a well-defined start and endpoint and

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.730
proceed in a linear flow that's directed by the author of the visualization.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.440
Viewer-driven narratives on the other hand,

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.150
while still having a well-defined start point, allow a freedom of choice for

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.080
the viewer to choose the direction in which the narrative progresses.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.640
In this way while each user starts in the same place there are various

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.010
endings that they could end up depending on how they look at the data or

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.110
the choices they made along the way.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.430
This type of narrative is very powerful because it allows the user to

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.099
choose their our narrative.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:06.370
You can think of it like a choose your own adventure book,

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.460
where you're writing the story as you're experiencing it.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.620
Visual narratives,

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.920
often called narrative visualization, combine conventions of communicative and

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.050
exploratory information visualization to convey an intended story.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.071
We often see stories fall within a spectrum,

00:01:22.071 --> 00:01:25.270
between author-driven and viewer-driven.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.280
Visualizations that have few exploratory elements,

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.830
are often called author-driven.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.460
And are useful for narratives that have strong ordering, heavy messaging, or

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.995
have a need for clarity and speed in the narrative.

00:01:36.995 --> 00:01:41.330
Viewer-driven narratives on the other hand, take a very different approach.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.710
Rather than dictating a specific narrative,

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.730
it allows the viewer to freely interact with the data.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:51.610
Allowing you to ask questions, explore, and tell their own data story.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.930
Now let's look at a few examples of author-driven data visualizations.
