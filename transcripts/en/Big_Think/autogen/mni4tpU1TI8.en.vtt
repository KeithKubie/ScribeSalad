this question you could have been

this question you could have been

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
thinking where we're going to have all
 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.319 align:start position:0%
thinking where we're going to have all

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 align:start position:0%
those 50 year olds and now we have all

those 50 year olds and now we have all

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 align:start position:0%
those 50 year olds so what I think we'll
 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.130 align:start position:0%
those 50 year olds so what I think we'll
see<00:00:53.610><c> is</c><00:00:53.789><c> a</c><00:00:53.820><c> healthier</c><00:00:54.420><c> more</c><00:00:54.600><c> vigorous</c>

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 align:start position:0%
