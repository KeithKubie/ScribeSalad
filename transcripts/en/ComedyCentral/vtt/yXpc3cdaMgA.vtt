00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.069
What was the purpose of starting
a show called The New Negroes?

00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:05.571
Well, it was to create a space
for people to exchange ideas,

00:00:05.571 --> 00:00:08.274
go to church
in a certain way.

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:10.143
I like church.

00:00:13.612 --> 00:00:15.681
I do the rap stuff,
Baron's the stand up.

00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:18.184
But don't try to brand us
or put us in handcuffs

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.687
for fans up,
jealousy got into music.

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:24.257
To you it feels new, but it's
not confusing New Negro.

00:00:24.257 --> 00:00:26.892
Some people that stand up,
a word or a scene

00:00:26.892 --> 00:00:28.427
they was not aware of.

00:00:28.427 --> 00:00:30.763
We heard you believe
what the media told you.

00:00:30.763 --> 00:00:34.266
Them old ideas get blown up,
behold the New Negro.

00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.768
This, that and the third.

00:00:35.768 --> 00:00:38.338
Man you say you seen it all,
and you sound absurd.

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:40.673
This is The New Negros,
are you excited?

00:00:42.275 --> 00:00:43.876
I feel like when I tell people
I went camping

00:00:43.876 --> 00:00:47.180
for the first time they're like
but you're a full adult.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.082
But I'm Black.

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:50.449
I see what's going on.

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.418
Welcome to revolution brother.

00:00:52.418 --> 00:00:55.355
Why y'all new Negroes,
y'all both almost 40.

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:58.358
The New Negroes with Baron Vaughn
and Open Mike Eagle.
