00:00:00.371 --> 00:00:02.927
 When dealing with science, it is normal to 

00:00:02.927 --> 00:00:05.245
 we categorize large groups of objects like 

00:00:05.245 --> 00:00:07.902
 things that are unimaginably small. 

00:00:07.902 --> 00:00:10.219
 When people talk about things with atom, 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:11.571
 molecular, 

00:00:11.571 --> 00:00:13.780
 protein or cell size, 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.567
 often group them together 

00:00:15.567 --> 00:00:16.771
 and they say that's really a lot, 

00:00:16.771 --> 00:00:18.392
 very small things. 

00:00:18.392 --> 00:00:19.969
 What I want to do in this video 

00:00:19.969 --> 00:00:21.695
 is to explain that even 

00:00:21.695 --> 00:00:23.951
 all the things I mentioned are very small, 

00:00:23.951 --> 00:00:25.652
 there is a huge difference 

00:00:25.652 --> 00:00:27.387
 in their dimensions. 

00:00:27.387 --> 00:00:29.278
 I hope that this way you can appreciate 

00:00:29.278 --> 00:00:33.283
 how complicated it may be like a cage. 

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:35.141
 How can all these organelles exist? 

00:00:35.141 --> 00:00:38.290
 How it can be a living organism or 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.726
 part of a living organism? 

00:00:40.726 --> 00:00:42.941
 Here on this scale 

00:00:42.941 --> 00:00:44.416
 I have painted 

00:00:44.416 --> 00:00:46.032
 water molecule. 

00:00:46.032 --> 00:00:48.558
 We have oxygen 

00:00:48.558 --> 00:00:49.558
 in purple 

00:00:49.558 --> 00:00:51.575
 and two hydrogen atoms, 

00:00:51.575 --> 00:00:52.639
 related to oxygen. 

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:54.375
 This will be rough around 

00:00:54.375 --> 00:00:55.792
 0.275 nanometers. 

00:00:57.841 --> 00:00:59.240
 And just to recall, 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.556
 one nanometer is one billionth 

00:01:01.556 --> 00:01:02.623
 from the meter. 

00:01:02.623 --> 00:01:04.754
 To understand how little this is - 

00:01:04.754 --> 00:01:05.750
 - 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:06.960
 It is 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.300
 one billion 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.383
 one billion 

00:01:11.055 --> 00:01:12.555
 one billion 

00:01:14.752 --> 00:01:16.267
 one billionth of a meter. 

00:01:16.267 --> 00:01:17.470
 That's one nanometer. 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:18.805
 And if you're trying to be 

00:01:18.805 --> 00:01:20.077
 give it up, 

00:01:20.077 --> 00:01:22.211
 it will be one millionth 

00:01:22.211 --> 00:01:23.920
 of the millimeter. 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.458
 I will write it, 

00:01:26.458 --> 00:01:27.875
 one millionth 

00:01:29.404 --> 00:01:31.290
 one millionth 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.623
 by one millimeter. 

00:01:34.124 --> 00:01:35.771
 I like this definition, 

00:01:35.771 --> 00:01:37.770
 because it's a millimeter 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.687
 the smallest unit of measurement, 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.366
 which I can visualize really well. 

00:01:43.366 --> 00:01:45.197
 But one millionth of a millimeter 

00:01:45.197 --> 00:01:48.549
 is far above my options 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:49.932
 for visualization. 

00:01:49.932 --> 00:01:51.677
 This will be the diameter or 

00:01:51.677 --> 00:01:54.697
 the width of the water molecule. 

00:01:54.697 --> 00:01:56.191
 Now, let's go to a larger size. 

00:01:56.191 --> 00:01:57.847
 We've talked a lot about the proteins 

00:01:57.847 --> 00:01:58.795
 and this is our start friend here 

00:01:58.795 --> 00:02:00.727
 - 

00:02:00.727 --> 00:02:03.130
 hemoglobin. 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.652
 Now you will begin to understand the scale better, 

00:02:04.652 --> 00:02:06.590
 the hemoglobin width will be 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.795
 about five nanometers. 

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:11.295
 Or five billionth of a meter. 

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:13.924
 This may seem very little, 

00:02:13.924 --> 00:02:15.850
 so it might be good to categorize 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.181
 these objects are extremely small. 

00:02:18.181 --> 00:02:19.108
 But it is good to be able to appreciate that 

00:02:19.108 --> 00:02:21.462
 hemoglobin is much larger than the water molecule. 

00:02:21.462 --> 00:02:23.693
 If the water molecule was placed on this scale - 

00:02:23.693 --> 00:02:24.948
 I drew this little thing in advance, 

00:02:24.948 --> 00:02:26.917
 this is my attempt to draw 

00:02:26.917 --> 00:02:28.876
 molecule of water 

00:02:28.876 --> 00:02:30.148
 in the hemoglobin scale. 

00:02:30.148 --> 00:02:31.866
 Even when we move from 

00:02:31.866 --> 00:02:34.094
 water molecule to protein, 

00:02:34.094 --> 00:02:36.576
 we have a dramatic increase in size 

00:02:36.576 --> 00:02:38.180
 and the complexity of the molecules. 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.774
 We have talked a lot about the structure of proteins, 

00:02:39.774 --> 00:02:40.921
 about how they can all have these 

00:02:40.921 --> 00:02:42.889
 interesting forms and perform a lot 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:44.976
 surprising and complex features 

00:02:44.976 --> 00:02:47.393
 in biological systems. 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:49.658
 But let's go one more step up. 

00:02:52.308 --> 00:02:53.513
 The next step 

00:02:53.513 --> 00:02:55.327
 are the vurs. 

00:02:55.327 --> 00:02:57.056
 What I have tried to draw here, 

00:02:57.056 --> 00:02:59.692
 is a well-known virus. 

00:02:59.692 --> 00:03:01.456
 This is HIV. 

00:03:01.456 --> 00:03:03.241
 It is one of the major viruses, 

00:03:03.241 --> 00:03:04.645
 its diameter is about 

00:03:04.645 --> 00:03:05.478
 120 

00:03:06.766 --> 00:03:08.016
 120 nanometers. 

00:03:08.995 --> 00:03:10.536
 If we draw 

00:03:10.536 --> 00:03:12.314
 this hemoglobin, 

00:03:12.314 --> 00:03:14.500
 the hemoglobin protein on the scale in which 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.834
 I've painted this virus, 

00:03:15.834 --> 00:03:17.081
 this here 

00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:18.767
 will be hemoglobin. 

00:03:18.767 --> 00:03:19.883
 And the water molecule can not be seen 

00:03:19.883 --> 00:03:21.698
 at this scale. 

00:03:21.698 --> 00:03:23.322
 - 

00:03:23.322 --> 00:03:25.530
 However, the virus is very, very small. 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.937
 That's 120 billion 

00:03:27.937 --> 00:03:29.470
 by one meter. 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.201
 That's still it 

00:03:31.201 --> 00:03:33.951
 unimaginably small size. 

00:03:34.877 --> 00:03:36.094
 Let's climb one more 

00:03:36.094 --> 00:03:37.648
 step up. 

00:03:37.648 --> 00:03:39.330
 This ominous picture 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:40.547
 here 

00:03:40.547 --> 00:03:41.958
 is the T cell. 

00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.583
 This is a drawing, 

00:03:43.583 --> 00:03:44.745
 if you want to see 

00:03:44.745 --> 00:03:45.666
 the entire T cell, 

00:03:45.666 --> 00:03:48.220
 she is here. 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.581
 This is a T cell. 

00:03:49.581 --> 00:03:50.584
 And on this ominous picture, 

00:03:50.584 --> 00:03:51.753
 blue 

00:03:51.753 --> 00:03:53.048
 is the T cell, 

00:03:53.048 --> 00:03:54.396
 and the yellow shows 

00:03:54.396 --> 00:03:56.896
 HIV virus coming out of the T cell 

00:03:57.952 --> 00:04:00.465
 and uses it for their needs. 

00:04:00.465 --> 00:04:02.456
 That's why it's ominous. 

00:04:02.456 --> 00:04:04.663
 The virus uses the organs of the cell, 

00:04:04.663 --> 00:04:06.511
 to reproduce. 

00:04:06.511 --> 00:04:08.313
 You can see this picture right now 

00:04:08.313 --> 00:04:10.713
 how small is the HIV virus 

00:04:10.713 --> 00:04:13.657
 compared to the T cell. 

00:04:13.657 --> 00:04:16.881
 Each of these little things - 

00:04:16.881 --> 00:04:18.700
 each of these little things 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.162
 is the HIV virus, as we have already seen 

00:04:21.162 --> 00:04:23.612
 is much bigger 

00:04:23.612 --> 00:04:25.604
 of the hemoglobin protein. 

00:04:25.604 --> 00:04:26.800
 So hemoglobin 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.779
 will not be visible 

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:29.546
 on this scale, against the T-cell background 

00:04:29.546 --> 00:04:30.547
 or will be the most 

00:04:30.547 --> 00:04:31.380
 one pixel. 

00:04:32.585 --> 00:04:34.846
 Scale similar to T-cell 

00:04:34.846 --> 00:04:37.623
 have red blood cells. 

00:04:37.623 --> 00:04:39.450
 Here is a comparison of both 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.283
 next to each other. 

00:04:40.283 --> 00:04:41.687
 This photo is used 

00:04:41.687 --> 00:04:43.322
 electronic microscope. 

00:04:43.322 --> 00:04:45.064
 You see the red blood cell here, 

00:04:45.064 --> 00:04:45.897
 as well as the T-cell. 

00:04:45.897 --> 00:04:47.243
 Both have similarities 

00:04:47.243 --> 00:04:48.660
 dimensions. 

00:04:49.701 --> 00:04:52.003
 Or at least their dimensions are on the same scale. 

00:04:52.003 --> 00:04:53.482
 The red blood cell is 

00:04:53.482 --> 00:04:55.565
 about six to eight micrometers 

00:04:56.535 --> 00:04:58.017
 wide. 

00:04:58.017 --> 00:04:59.835
 These are six to eight million 

00:04:59.835 --> 00:05:00.668
 from the meter. 

00:05:00.668 --> 00:05:01.526
 Assuming the average size 

00:05:01.526 --> 00:05:03.126
 for seven micrometers, 

00:05:03.126 --> 00:05:04.199
 these are 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:06.019
 seven million 

00:05:06.019 --> 00:05:06.852
 seven 

00:05:07.847 --> 00:05:09.802
 millionth 

00:05:09.802 --> 00:05:10.853
 from the meter. 

00:05:10.853 --> 00:05:11.686
 Here we are talking about 

00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:14.061
 millionth of a millimeter. 

00:05:14.061 --> 00:05:16.236
 Now we are talking about seven million 

00:05:16.236 --> 00:05:17.917
 from the meter. 

00:05:17.917 --> 00:05:19.758
 And to understand the dimensions, 

00:05:19.758 --> 00:05:21.495
 we have already compared 

00:05:21.495 --> 00:05:23.369
 HIV virus with this cell. 

00:05:23.369 --> 00:05:24.525
 We see the virus 

00:05:24.525 --> 00:05:26.692
 goes out of the cage. 

00:05:27.872 --> 00:05:30.240
 Each of these red blood cells 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.159
 will contain close 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:34.909
 280 million hemoglobin molecules. 

00:05:36.688 --> 00:05:39.364
 - 

00:05:39.364 --> 00:05:40.477
 Will have 

00:05:40.477 --> 00:05:42.806
 280 million of these molecules. 

00:05:42.806 --> 00:05:44.056
 280 million, 

00:05:45.876 --> 00:05:47.861
 these are millions 

00:05:47.861 --> 00:05:49.470
 millions of molecules of hemoglobin 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:50.920
 in each cell. 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.195
 I hope this starts to 

00:05:52.195 --> 00:05:53.710
 tells you that 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.588
 even categorizing 

00:05:55.588 --> 00:05:57.652
 cells like these unthinkable little things, 

00:05:57.652 --> 00:05:59.404
 they are actually much larger, 

00:05:59.404 --> 00:06:03.000
 giant are compared to other objects 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.533
 even when compared to large proteins. 

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:07.902
 Especially compared to 

00:06:07.902 --> 00:06:09.901
 molecules and atoms. 

00:06:09.901 --> 00:06:11.284
 That's why the cells are so interesting. 

00:06:11.284 --> 00:06:13.210
 They are very complicated 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.771
 and complex. 

00:06:14.771 --> 00:06:16.770
 Now we'll explain how much 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.053
 small are the cells, 

00:06:19.053 --> 00:06:20.434
 even though we described it a while ago 

00:06:20.434 --> 00:06:22.253
 red blood cells and T-cells 

00:06:22.253 --> 00:06:25.753
 as it targets the worlds in its own right. 

00:06:25.753 --> 00:06:28.083
 They are very complicated. 

00:06:28.083 --> 00:06:30.549
 If I paint the width 

00:06:30.549 --> 00:06:31.855
 of human hair 

00:06:31.855 --> 00:06:33.350
 on this screen, 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:34.269
 compared to size 

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:35.515
 of these red blood cells, 

00:06:35.515 --> 00:06:37.774
 he will whole screen the video. 

00:06:37.774 --> 00:06:39.787
 If I draw a human hair, 

00:06:39.787 --> 00:06:41.416
 roughly speaking, it will start from here and it will get here. 

00:06:41.416 --> 00:06:42.605
 There is a lot of variety 

00:06:42.605 --> 00:06:44.286
 in the width of the human hair. 

00:06:44.286 --> 00:06:45.739
 But the width of a human hair 

00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:47.229
 will look like this. 

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:48.956
 If you look at the scale 

00:06:50.473 --> 00:06:51.586
 on this photo here, 

00:06:51.586 --> 00:06:52.652
 if you look at these scales, 

00:06:52.652 --> 00:06:55.050
 the hair will be much, much larger. 

00:06:56.062 --> 00:06:56.938
 We can think of the width of 

00:06:56.938 --> 00:06:58.074
 human hair as for - 

00:06:58.074 --> 00:06:58.976
 Cut your hair one. 

00:06:58.976 --> 00:06:59.809
 Look at him. 

00:06:59.809 --> 00:07:00.642
 Put it on a piece of paper, 

00:07:00.642 --> 00:07:02.727
 it's hard to even notice his breadth. 

00:07:02.727 --> 00:07:03.758
 And we say that the width of the hair, 

00:07:03.758 --> 00:07:06.196
 compared to these red blood cells, 

00:07:06.196 --> 00:07:07.576
 will take the width of 

00:07:07.576 --> 00:07:08.502
 the entire screen of the video. 

00:07:08.502 --> 00:07:09.752
 And as we have already said, red blood cells 

00:07:09.752 --> 00:07:11.044
 and T-cells 

00:07:11.044 --> 00:07:13.720
 are worlds in their own right when we compare them 

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.803
 with the scale of viruses and molecules.
