00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
And I ain't saying he's a
gold digger, but-- no, wait.

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.845
These guys really
are gold diggers.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:10.340
Hey, folks.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.350
Laci Green here.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.230
The word Klondike might summon
visions of delicious ice cream

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.860
goodness, but it's
time to switch gears

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.570
to the Klondike gold rush.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.590
Crazy story, actually.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.070
In the late 1800s, gold
was discovered up in Alaska

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.850
in the Klondike river.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.086
Because the area was
so remote, and it was,

00:00:25.086 --> 00:00:29.350
you know, the 1800s, it took a
whole year for word to get out.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.140
Once word did get out, 100,000
people uprooted their lives

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.925
and headed up to
the Klondike region,

00:00:34.925 --> 00:00:36.250
hoping to strike it rich.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.230
But it was a really
difficult journey,

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.290
and only about 30,000
people actually made it.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.680
And of those, only a small
fraction, about 4,000 people,

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.790
ever found gold.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.490
Today I wanted to talk about
some notable gold diggers

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.230
from this fascinating
time in history

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.500
where people's hopes,
potential riches,

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.610
and the stakes were
all really high.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.450
First up, the man
who's now credited

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.180
with starting it
all, James Mason,

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.514
better known as Skookum Jim.

00:01:00.514 --> 00:01:02.930
Skookum was a Canadian native
who originally packed mining

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.590
supplies up the
snowy Chilkoot pass.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.900
Now, this pass was
serious, you guys.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.320
Seven miles through
icy, glacial rocks

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.120
that climbed up over 3,000 feet.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.540
Legend has it that
he single-handedly

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.150
156 pounds of bacon up the pass.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.687
When he first discovered
the gold at Rabbit Creek,

00:01:21.687 --> 00:01:23.645
they panned enough to
fill a shotgun cartridge,

00:01:23.645 --> 00:01:27.790
and he went on to make an
estimated $100,000, or three

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.130
million today.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.625
Stories about who actually
discovered the gold first

00:01:31.625 --> 00:01:33.510
in Klondike are mixed, though.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.210
First, a friend
of Skookum's named

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.250
George Carmack was
credited, because nobody

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.490
would believe a native.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.100
But there are also accounts of
Kate Carmack, George's wife,

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.797
having discovered the gold
while the men were taking a nap.

00:01:43.797 --> 00:01:46.130
I'm pretty sure that of all
the successful gold diggers,

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.660
Kate Carmack got
the most screwed.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.490
First, possible stolen credit.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.840
But that's nothing
compared to what came next.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.980
During the gold rush, she
and her husband George

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.530
panned and made millions.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.690
They moved to Seattle
to enjoy their riches,

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.148
but it was hard on both of
them, and they missed their home

00:02:01.148 --> 00:02:01.850
in in Dawson.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.980
Instead of allowing Kate to
come back north with him,

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.835
George sent Kate to California
to live with his sister,

00:02:07.835 --> 00:02:10.500
while he went back alone,
enjoying the lavish life

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.950
and courting other women.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.465
And down in
California, Kate tried

00:02:13.465 --> 00:02:15.590
to make a legal appeal for
her share of the riches,

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.541
but the court denied.

00:02:17.541 --> 00:02:19.540
George took all of their
money, and Kate went on

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.100
to live off a government pension
in a cabin built by Skookum.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.406
Last of our interesting gold
diggers today, Jack London.

00:02:26.406 --> 00:02:28.030
You've probably heard
that name, right?

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.404
He wrote one of
my old favorites,

00:02:29.404 --> 00:02:30.610
The Call of the Wild.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.420
In his early years, London was
a poor man from San Francisco.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.950
And hoping to
escape unemployment,

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.260
he went to UC Berkeley,
my alma mater,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.850
before dropping out
to join the gold rush.

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.760
The gold rush itself
wasn't kind to London.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.910
He became malnourished,
developed scurvy,

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.890
and struggled with
serious health issues

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.030
due to lack of food and shelter.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.890
But it's through these
hardships that Jack

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.310
wrote his first successful
story, To Build A Fire.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.470
He went on to become a
very influential socialist

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.730
and writer.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:57.390
Boom.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.630
Redemption.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.130
To learn more about
the gold rush,

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.917

new miniseries

00:03:01.917 --> 00:03:03.750

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.394

00:03:05.394 --> 00:03:07.060
Thanks for joining
me for D News, folks.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.910
