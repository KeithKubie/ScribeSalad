00:00:00.561 --> 00:00:02.895
- [Voiceover] Let's talk
about buffer capacity.

00:00:04.083 --> 00:00:07.614
Buffer capacity is a property of a buffer

00:00:07.614 --> 00:00:11.073
and it tells you how much

00:00:11.073 --> 00:00:15.089
acid or base you can add
before the pH starts changing.

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.737
Basically, as

00:00:17.737 --> 00:00:20.175
your buffer capacity goes up,

00:00:20.175 --> 00:00:21.730
which I'm going to abbreviate BC,

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.493
as your buffer capacity goes up,

00:00:24.493 --> 00:00:26.189
you can

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.605
add

00:00:27.605 --> 00:00:31.100
more of your acid or base

00:00:34.355 --> 00:00:37.108
before the pH starts changing a lot.

00:00:41.872 --> 00:00:43.405
That might seem like a pretty vague

00:00:43.405 --> 00:00:47.794
and qualitative definition,
so let's go through an example

00:00:47.794 --> 00:00:51.546
to see what that might look like exactly.

00:00:51.546 --> 00:00:53.330
The example we're gonna look at

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.743
is going to be using
an acetic acid buffer.

00:00:56.743 --> 00:01:01.743
So acetic acid is CH three COOH.

00:01:04.197 --> 00:01:09.084
And we're gonna abbreviate
that in this talk using HA.

00:01:10.507 --> 00:01:12.758
And this is an aqueous solution

00:01:12.758 --> 00:01:15.894
and that is reversibly reacting

00:01:15.894 --> 00:01:20.885
to form H plus ion

00:01:20.885 --> 00:01:25.885
and CH three COO minus,

00:01:26.517 --> 00:01:28.283
or acetate.

00:01:28.283 --> 00:01:31.093
And so we're gonna abbreviate
acetate in this talk

00:01:31.093 --> 00:01:32.903
as A minus.

00:01:32.903 --> 00:01:35.841
So more information about
this particular buffer.

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.412
Acetic acid, the Ka is equal to

00:01:41.412 --> 00:01:45.336
1.8 times 10 to the minus five.

00:01:45.336 --> 00:01:47.148
And if we take the negative log of that,

00:01:47.148 --> 00:01:49.261
that will give us the pKa,

00:01:49.261 --> 00:01:50.839
which is also useful.

00:01:50.839 --> 00:01:55.839
And the pKa of acetic acid is 4.74.

00:01:56.342 --> 00:02:00.522
So that'll tell us a lot about
the behavior of this buffer.

00:02:00.522 --> 00:02:03.215
And the last thing we need to know for

00:02:03.215 --> 00:02:05.862
predicting the behavior of our buffer

00:02:05.862 --> 00:02:10.862
is what the ratio is
between our HA and A minus.

00:02:11.993 --> 00:02:16.993
So we're going to be
looking at a buffer where

00:02:17.136 --> 00:02:20.928
A minus over HA, this ratio,

00:02:21.861 --> 00:02:26.060
is equal to 1.82.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.043
Based on this ration,
we can calculate the pH.

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:33.831
So the initial pH of our buffer

00:02:33.831 --> 00:02:35.039
before we do anything to it,

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:38.197
before we add any acid or we add any base,

00:02:38.197 --> 00:02:40.937
the initial pH of our
buffer we can calculate

00:02:40.937 --> 00:02:43.318
using the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation.

00:02:44.276 --> 00:02:48.524
And so that equation tells
that pH is equal to pKa

00:02:48.524 --> 00:02:53.456
plus log of A minus concentration,

00:02:53.456 --> 00:02:57.449
or acetate, over acetic
acid concentration.

00:02:57.449 --> 00:03:01.420
And if you're not 100% confident
with using this equation,

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.929
or you want to know where it comes from,

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:04.879
we actually have separate videos on it,

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:06.644
so I would recommend checking those out.

00:03:06.644 --> 00:03:11.055
In this video, we're just going
to use this equation as is.

00:03:11.055 --> 00:03:12.820
So if we plug in our values here,

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.023
we get that the initial pKa is equal to

00:03:17.023 --> 00:03:20.529
4.74, our pKa,

00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:24.174
plus log of 1.82,

00:03:24.174 --> 00:03:27.030
which is our ratio of A minus over HA.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.573
So then we know our initial pH is equal to

00:03:32.226 --> 00:03:34.658
5.00.

00:03:34.658 --> 00:03:38.072
What we're gonna do next
is we're gonna look at

00:03:38.072 --> 00:03:40.255
two different buffers,

00:03:40.255 --> 00:03:43.687
and both of them are going
to be made with acetic acid

00:03:43.687 --> 00:03:46.682
and with acetate.

00:03:46.682 --> 00:03:49.561
And we're gonna call them
buffer one and buffer two.

00:03:49.561 --> 00:03:53.270
So buffer one has a ratio

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.581
of A minus NHA that is 1.82.

00:03:57.701 --> 00:04:00.441
So the pH is going to be five.

00:04:00.441 --> 00:04:03.599
And the A minus concentration,

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.293
before we do anything to it,

00:04:05.293 --> 00:04:06.269
before we add anything,

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.370
is 0.90 molar.

00:04:09.491 --> 00:04:11.453
And the HA concentration

00:04:12.875 --> 00:04:15.488
is going to be 0.49 molar.

00:04:16.516 --> 00:04:19.767
And our second buffer that
we're gonna compare it to

00:04:19.767 --> 00:04:23.147
we will call buffer two.

00:04:24.174 --> 00:04:29.096
And buffer two also has the
same ratio of acid to base,

00:04:29.096 --> 00:04:32.045
except this time both concentrations

00:04:32.045 --> 00:04:35.527
are gonna be 10 times
smaller than buffer one.

00:04:35.527 --> 00:04:40.527
So our A minus concentration
is 0.090 molar.

00:04:42.861 --> 00:04:47.861
And our acetic acid
concentration is 0.049 molar.

00:04:49.821 --> 00:04:51.122
And what we're gonna do
here is we're gonna see

00:04:51.122 --> 00:04:53.444
what happens to the pH of both of these,

00:04:53.444 --> 00:04:55.765
So they both start out with a pH of five,

00:04:55.765 --> 00:04:59.260
but how much do they change when we add...

00:05:00.125 --> 00:05:01.531
We're going to

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:07.668
add 0.04 moles

00:05:07.668 --> 00:05:11.397
of a strong base, sodium hydroxide,

00:05:11.397 --> 00:05:13.782
to one liter buffer.

00:05:15.947 --> 00:05:18.222
So when you do that,

00:05:18.222 --> 00:05:19.361
well it's a buffer.

00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:22.170
We know that it's going
to resist the pH change,

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:23.446
but what exactly is happening?

00:05:23.446 --> 00:05:26.768
What's the reaction that
goes on when you add this in?

00:05:26.768 --> 00:05:28.881
So when you add your strong base,

00:05:28.881 --> 00:05:32.526
which is going to
dissociate to form OH minus,

00:05:32.526 --> 00:05:36.613
it's going to react with
the acid in your buffer.

00:05:36.613 --> 00:05:39.351
So our acid is

00:05:39.351 --> 00:05:43.357
CH three COOH.

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:48.168
And we always assume that a strong base

00:05:48.168 --> 00:05:52.324
is going to react irreversibly.

00:05:52.324 --> 00:05:55.194
So one-sided arrow with a weak acid.

00:05:56.128 --> 00:05:58.542
So what happens is this proton

00:05:58.542 --> 00:06:00.656
is going to react with OH
minus and we're gonna get

00:06:00.656 --> 00:06:02.862
H two O, or water.

00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:06.846
And we're gonna make CH three COO minus.

00:06:08.012 --> 00:06:09.555
So that's our base.

00:06:10.698 --> 00:06:12.766
And so we can see that the hydroxide

00:06:12.766 --> 00:06:16.295
is going to react one to
one with our weak acid

00:06:16.295 --> 00:06:20.196
and it's gonna produce one
equivalent of our base.

00:06:20.196 --> 00:06:21.727
So now we can use this information

00:06:21.727 --> 00:06:23.864
to calculate what happens to our buffer

00:06:23.864 --> 00:06:27.289
when we add .04 moles of sodium hydroxide.

00:06:28.571 --> 00:06:30.917
What's gonna happen is it's gonna react

00:06:30.917 --> 00:06:32.937
with our acid.

00:06:32.937 --> 00:06:36.043
Which means the concentration
of the acetic acid

00:06:36.043 --> 00:06:38.610
is gonna go down by .04 molar.

00:06:40.727 --> 00:06:43.004
Our new concentration after it's reacted

00:06:43.004 --> 00:06:48.004
is gonna be 0.45 molar.

00:06:49.946 --> 00:06:52.174
Sorry, I tried to do that in my head.

00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:58.301
And what happens to our
concentration of the base?

00:06:58.301 --> 00:07:02.410
Remember that when the acid
reacts with sodium hydroxide

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.630
we actually make more base,

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:09.630
So we have to adjust the
concentration of A minus upward.

00:07:10.253 --> 00:07:14.415
It actually makes .04 molar acetate

00:07:14.415 --> 00:07:16.267
when this reaction happens.

00:07:16.267 --> 00:07:19.750
So our new concentration
of our acetate ion

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:23.408
is 0.94 molar.

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:26.409
So these are our final concentrations.

00:07:26.409 --> 00:07:29.775
We can no plug them back in to the

00:07:29.775 --> 00:07:33.003
Henderson–Hasselbalch
equation to get the pH.

00:07:33.003 --> 00:07:35.488
So the pH of buffer one,

00:07:35.488 --> 00:07:37.920
I'll put a little subscript one,

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.392
is going to be 4.74, the pKa,

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:47.230
plus log of 0.94 molar

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:50.970
divided by 0.45 molar.

00:07:52.532 --> 00:07:54.761
And if we plug that into our calculator,

00:07:54.761 --> 00:07:58.012
we get that the pH after
we add that hydroxide

00:07:58.012 --> 00:07:59.934
is 5.06.

00:07:59.934 --> 00:08:01.117
So it's a little bit higher.

00:08:01.117 --> 00:08:03.208
It went up by .06.

00:08:03.208 --> 00:08:04.717
That makes sense.

00:08:04.717 --> 00:08:06.993
We do imagine it would be higher.

00:08:06.993 --> 00:08:08.664
If you add base, it becomes more basic

00:08:08.664 --> 00:08:10.475
and the pH should go up.

00:08:10.475 --> 00:08:11.799
But it didn't change a whole lot,

00:08:11.799 --> 00:08:14.209
because it's a buffer.

00:08:14.209 --> 00:08:17.785
Now let's compare that with
what happens to buffer two.

00:08:17.785 --> 00:08:22.785
We add .04 mole sodium
hydroxide to buffer two.

00:08:22.846 --> 00:08:27.457
Our acetic acid concentration
is gonna go down by .04 molar.

00:08:28.716 --> 00:08:33.598
So our new concentration
of HA is .009 molar.

00:08:33.598 --> 00:08:37.568
By the same reaction,
our base concentration

00:08:37.568 --> 00:08:39.659
is gonna go up,

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:43.526
since when the acid reacts,
it makes more conjugate base.

00:08:43.526 --> 00:08:48.077
So we're gonna have to add 0.04 molar

00:08:48.077 --> 00:08:50.260
to A minus concentration.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:54.012
And so the new concentration
is going to be 0.13 molar.

00:08:55.178 --> 00:08:58.290
And we can plug those concentrations into

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.682
the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation

00:09:00.682 --> 00:09:04.606
and we get that pH of our buffer two

00:09:04.606 --> 00:09:08.855
is equal to 4.74, our pKa,

00:09:10.567 --> 00:09:14.674
plus log of 0.13 molar

00:09:14.674 --> 00:09:16.294
divided by

00:09:16.294 --> 00:09:20.813
0.009 molar.

00:09:20.813 --> 00:09:24.718
And so that would be, if we
plugged this into our calculator

00:09:24.718 --> 00:09:27.481
this is equal to 1.16.

00:09:27.481 --> 00:09:30.104
So if we add that together with our pKa,

00:09:30.104 --> 00:09:33.948
we get that the new pH is 5.90 molar.

00:09:34.977 --> 00:09:36.764
So the pH changed a whole lot more

00:09:36.764 --> 00:09:39.136
for buffer two than for buffer one.

00:09:39.136 --> 00:09:43.242
The pH went up by .9 instead of by .06.

00:09:43.242 --> 00:09:46.284
So if we were comparing
the buffer capacities

00:09:46.284 --> 00:09:48.005
of both of these buffers,

00:09:48.005 --> 00:09:50.467
we would say that

00:09:50.467 --> 00:09:52.046
buffer one,

00:09:52.046 --> 00:09:55.226
well, the buffer changes less when you add

00:09:55.226 --> 00:09:57.108
the same amount of acid or base.

00:09:57.108 --> 00:10:00.858
So buffer one has the
higher buffer capacity.

00:10:03.115 --> 00:10:06.621
Since you don't want these concentrations,

00:10:06.621 --> 00:10:08.850
A minus and HA, to be too low,

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:12.182
the general rule of thumb is that you want

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:16.274
your concentrations of HA

00:10:16.274 --> 00:10:20.286
and A minus between

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:24.595
0.10 molar and

00:10:26.086 --> 00:10:28.352
1.0 molar.

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:33.303
And by following that rule of thumb,

00:10:33.303 --> 00:10:34.835
you can make a buffer

00:10:34.835 --> 00:10:36.832
where you don't have to worry too much

00:10:36.832 --> 00:10:39.270
about adding too much acid or base

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:41.011
before you pH changes,

00:10:41.011 --> 00:10:42.771
since that's usually why
you're making a buffer

00:10:42.771 --> 00:10:43.657
in the first place.
