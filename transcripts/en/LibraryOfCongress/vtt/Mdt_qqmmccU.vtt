00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.190
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:10.880 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Our final speaker before break is
Geoff Haines-Stiles, who has worked

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.750
on Innovative Science
Media Project since 1978

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.300
when he was series
director and senior producer

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.010
for Carl Sagan's landmark, an
Emmy-winning COSMOS series.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.210
He's here today to talk
about The Crowd &amp; The Cloud

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.740
and how citizen science has
revolutionized scientific data.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.520
Science by, for and with the
people, how citizen, science

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.250
and mobile tech have revolutionized
the collection, sharing

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.520
and use of scientific data.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.110
Geoff, take it away.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.410
&gt;&gt; Geoff Haines-Stiles:
I was going to say,

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.710
and now for something
completely different,

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.470 position:56%
but every single talk has been
completely different, so I won't say

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.330
and now for something
completely different.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.630
But thanks to the Library
of Congress

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.400
for inviting us all along today.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.510
And I've got some references
from what we saw yesterday

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.730
that actually tie into some
of the themes of this talk.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.480
I've been a science
producer since 1980.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.860
It's taken me to the ends of
the Earth, which is fortunate,

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.630
because in the Antarctic,
they give you helmets

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.080
to cover your bald spot,
so everything is good.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.730
I'm here today to talk
about The Crowd &amp; The Cloud.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.790
My collaborators on that
project are Waleed Abdalati,

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.370
a former NASA Chief Scientist.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.370
You'll see him in a
video clip in a moment.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.990
And my collaborator in life
and work, Erna Akuginow,

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.730
who's in the front there.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.030
Thank you, Erna.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.330
Recent grandmother.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.630
Congratulations.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.960
And see, the Library of Congress
congratulates you as well.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.440
Isn't this great?

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.520
So as was said, I've had a
great time working with some

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.990
of the most celebrated
scientists in the country,

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.050 position:56%
and also comedians like Lily Tomlin.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.760
What I hadn't been aware of until
I was walking around yesterday is

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.930
that the Library of Congress
actually has a great collection

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.800
of Alan Lomax memorabilia.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.000
I've worked with him on a
series called American Patchwork

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.280
about roots music.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.070
The Crowd &amp; The Cloud, funded by
the National Science Foundation,

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.760
is designed to increase
the visibility, credibility

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.800
and participation in
citizen science.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.160 position:56%
Now, how many people in the audience
could define citizen science

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.160
at a cocktail party?

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.600
That's about five or six
people out of a couple hundred.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.580
So that's one of the
reasons that we decided

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.020
that we should try
and do this series.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.670
Citizen science is
definitely a coming trend.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.930
You'll hear from some of the
citizen scientists yourselves.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.630
These are some of the
words that have been used

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.350
to define citizen science
over the past few years.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.080
You'll see cyber is
in a lot of them.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.880
A lot of them have natural
history environments

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.840
as part of the subject matter.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.210
One of my favorite ones
is nerds for nature,

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.400
and there's actually a citizen
science project called nerds

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.700
for nature.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.760
Another way of saying that,
however, would be science for, by,

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.620
for and with the people
that you may notice comes

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.950
from the Gettysburg Address, and
again, Lincoln is a great presence

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.250
in the Library of Congress.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.410
I was pleased to find
that out yesterday.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.700
We've created four one-hour
programs that debuted

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.650
on public television
this last spring.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.230 position:56%
I'm going to show you a large number
of video clips, which accounts

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.870
for me trying to talk rather fast.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.870
Crowdandcloud.org is where you can
find all of the programs streaming

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.110
in realtime if what we
show you is of interest.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.600
Our premise is to try and
turn viewers into doers.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.040
Not just to have a good
time watching a TV show,

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.690
but actually to be
encouraged to become part

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.390
of the citizen science movement.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.620
And it wouldn't be possible
without collaboration with a number

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.710
of government agencies and NGOs
and citizen science projects.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.880
So this is how we begin the series,

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.760
and this is how we
begin this presentation.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.180
&gt;&gt; The Crowd &amp; The Cloud
is made possible by NSF,

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.510
the National Science Foundation,
where discoveries begin.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.500
[ Music ]

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.870
&gt;&gt; This is today's citizen science.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.290
People pursuing their
passions, and at the same time,

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.130
generating data that's
useful for research.

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.430
&gt;&gt; I love surfing.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.730
I love science.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.780 position:56%
And I get to go surfing for science.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.610
&gt;&gt; Technology is a way to
really get people outside

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.780
and to look more carefully
at the natural world.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.180
&gt;&gt; There are now more mobile phones
on Earth than people on our planet.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.160
And new technologies can
help solve major challenges.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.190
&gt;&gt; Every single data
point has a human story.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.720
&gt;&gt; Now communities can use
science to tackle local problems.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.540
&gt;&gt; The state doesn't come and
say, you've got to clean this up.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.430 position:56%
So we started on the bucket brigade.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.230
&gt;&gt; They're linking sensors and
citizens to find solutions.

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.600
&gt;&gt; I'm learning about toxins.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.660
I'm learning how to teach
other people to do what I do

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.680
so they can do it for themselves.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.030
&gt;&gt; It was a lonely disease.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.820
But propellor sensors are going to
revolutionize the asthma treatment.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.040
&gt;&gt; Collaborating via the
cloud, the crowd can save time,

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.810
save money and save lives.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.980
We're surely smarter together.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.810
I'm Waleed Abdalati, host
of The Crowd &amp; The Cloud.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.100
I've studied Earth's ice sheets
from satellites and aircraft.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.310
And I was NASA Chief
Scientist at the time

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.080
when curiosity landed on Mars.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.490
So I know big data and big science.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:13.790
But I'm also convinced

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.060
that citizen-generated
data has an important role.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.760
No longer is science something
only done by professionals in labs.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.960
No more is data just the property
of corporations in government.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.390
&gt;&gt; For years, you've watched
science on public television.

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:34.250
Now you're invited to do science.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.590 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Geoff Haines-Stiles: Well, I hope
you can see we've got a wide variety

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.790
of projects that we feature
in the series, a wide variety

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.540
of folks who are involved.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.110
Citizen science actually
has a long history.

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.170
The background here is Thomas
Jefferson's weather records dating

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.280
back to the 1770s.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.920
And today's citizen
science is looking

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.370
at whether 20,000 observers are
recording daily precipitation

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.610
measurements, including
one, at least it was there,

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.560
on the left-hand side, a rain gauge

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.830
in Michelle Obama's
vegetable garden.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.990
So these are contributing data that
the National Weather Service uses

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.470
to update flash flood warnings.

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:14.470
History of the Christmas
Bird Count goes back to 1900.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.770
It's one of the longest
running citizen science projects

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.410
in the United States.

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.180 position:56%
But contemporary citizen science
also includes the make of movements,

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.760
millennials, folks like the people
that are part of public lab.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.000
And this is a gratuitous shot
just because it makes me think

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.150
of arcade fire on tour, but these
are actually citizen scientists

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.990
flying balloons underneath kites

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.840
to document the BP oil spill
off of Deepwater Horizon.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.700
Contemporary citizen science
also includes putting sensors,

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:46.750
microscopic sensors on surfboard
fins to look at ocean acidification

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.330
and sea surface temperature.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.980
So as we said, a great variety.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:55.760
Trying to tie my presentation to
the themes of this conference,

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.450
I'm going to talk about
three different kinds

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.620
of data collection and sharing.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.030
In some cases, it's a question of
data that's putting communities

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.070
on the map and helping
to solve problems.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.110
And that's what this next
little clip is about.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.620
The West Oakland Environmental
Indicator's Project, it was founded

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.990
to try to look at truck routes
going through West Oakland

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:17.270
and how truck routes were
corresponding to asthma attacks

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.240
in senior citizen centers
and daycare centers.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.540
They managed to get the truck
routes that you saw in red replaced

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.350
by the truck routes in green by
going out and counting trucks.

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:30.380 position:56%
Not counting birds, counting trucks,
and then going to city government

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.650
to get them to move
the truck routes away

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.460
from the most heavily
populated areas.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.240
They've continued their
work reaching out to kids,

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.240
trying to get kids excited about
the new generation of sensors.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.590
And this next little clip
shows how excited the teams,

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:47.070
like in the project that
Tom and Patrick showed you,

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:48.810
get when they're doing
authentic research.

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:50.690
In this case, it's not an archive.

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:52.150
They're using their environment,

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:55.360
their community as
the source of data.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.210
&gt;&gt; When the students have
been able to go out and walk

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:06.580
around the community and collect
data and then observe things,

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:11.250
they understand the correlation
between the data and the sources

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:13.410
of pollution that they're
interested in.

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:16.150
&gt;&gt; This is called the dust tracker.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:17.480
It measures how much dust

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.720
and particular matter
there is in the air.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.440
Particular matter is the little
dust particles that we can't see.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.920
The more cars pass by, the more
particular matter there is.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.610
And the less cars that pass
by, the less there are.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.950
&gt;&gt; So the air filter in
there, there's a cartridge.

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:35.300
They can send that out
and test particulars.

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:41.950
And they found that
it's kinds of metals.

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:44.370
And most of those things
are from the brakes,

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:47.310 position:56%
from the wheels and from the tracks.

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:48.610
So if you think about
metal, you're breathing it.

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:50.410
If it's a metal.

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:55.250
[ Inaudible ]

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:58.570
&gt;&gt; Because of the low cost sensors
available and the smart phones

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:01.960
or their devices, the
students can collect data

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:07.000
and immediately begin
interpreting them.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.940
&gt;&gt; In December, 2015, some of the
students presented their findings

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:14.610
at the American Geophysical
Union, which is one of the largest

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:15.910
and busiest gatherings

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:19.190
of professional earth
and space scientists.

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:21.950
&gt;&gt; We come to AGU,
like that's amazing.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:23.740
Like I didn't really realize
how big of a deal it was

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:26.810
until I started looking into it,
and we have something to bring

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:28.690
to the table, just us
high school students.

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:30.730
And people want to hear
what we have to say.

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:34.080
And it's kind of exciting, like
what I'm doing like really matters.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.380
&gt;&gt; It does matter.

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:36.680
It does matter.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it gives us hope,
like we might change something,

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:40.330
you know, like a taste of art.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:43.180
&gt;&gt; We sometimes frighten
the statisticians

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:46.590
because they would prefer to have
a little bit of perfectly pristine,

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:51.330
absolutely, you know, 100% data
from a million dollar machine.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:55.980 position:56%
And we're saying, no, no, let's take
this, you know, 200 dollar machine

00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:00.330
and start making decisions
based on it.

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.150
But the notion is that
if you had, you know,

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:05.480
a 1 million dollar machine,
you can do so much with that.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:10.170
But if you have a million hundred
dollar machines, all spewing data

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:15.310
into the cloud, turning it back
to us in a direct feedback loop,

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:19.800
then we start to adjust
behavior immediately.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.650
&gt;&gt; Geoff Haines-Stiles: So the
second category is citizen science.

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:27.700
I'm going to talk about where
there is no data, where there seems

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:30.160
to be no agencies that are
involved in gathering the data

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.270
as you might expect
and sharing that.

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:34.240
This is an example from
the second program,

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.660
which is called Citizens
Plus Scientists,

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:41.620
of where a concerned citizen,
Deb, you'll see her in the piece.

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.160
But because it's an edited segment,
it doesn't have the name supers.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.480
That's why the names are
here at the beginning.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.380
Was concerned about air
pollution in her area,

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.560
resulting from oil
and gas development.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:56.150
She went to an NGO, Denny Larson's
Bucket Brigade, captured data.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:58.750
And you'll see a little bit
about how data is captured.

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:01.620
And then shared that through
the peer review process

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:05.080
with a big result in
terms of state policy.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:08.670
So it goes all the way from
data collection to social good,

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:11.410
socially beneficial results.

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:17.800
&gt;&gt; It took right out a
hundred double semi-loads

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.100
to get the rig out.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.400
It was a triple rig.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.800
You know, the traffic
went from maybe 3

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.290
or 4 cars a week to like 50 a day.

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:27.200
Tons of dust on this county road.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.120
They'd flare for months.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:34.030
They'd light the flare, and the
whole crick bottom would shake.

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:36.530
And so our house would just shake.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:37.970
Lots of noise.

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:39.790
All the wildlife just took off.

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:44.140
There was spills and leaks.

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:46.310
And nobody cleans it up.

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:48.100
Nobody says anything
or does anything.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:49.400
There's no oversight.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:53.620
The state doesn't come out and
say, you've got to clean this up.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:55.720
It's left to the people
who are living there.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.620
&gt;&gt; The first thing that happens
is the sites are selected.

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:02.600
The citizen scientists are
trained on-site by ourselves.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.020
They've got a set number of
samples that they can take.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:09.690
So the samples are taken, literally
taking, you know, a plastic bucket

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:14.580
and putting some stainless steel on
it that will hold the sample bag.

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:15.880
It's like a loan.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:20.070 position:56%
So the bucket is the body, the bag
is the loan, and then there's a pump

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:23.680
which serves as your diaphragm,
which pumps the air out,

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:27.500
creating negative pressure,
opening the bag and bringing in air

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:30.170
so it can be sealed and
sent to the lab for testing.

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:33.780
And they process it immediately.

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:36.740
&gt;&gt; Bucket brigade techniques
have been reviewed by the EPA

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:39.820
and have been found to be
useful in capturing data

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:41.820
where government sensors
are lacking.

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:43.520
&gt;&gt; I was shocked.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:44.940
I didn't think we'd find much.

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:49.200
And we found emissions
off the freaking charts.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:54.760
&gt;&gt; We found that many of the
samples exceeded those standards.

00:12:54.760 --> 00:13:00.200 position:56%
Some for benzene were something like
10,000 times above the standard.

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.980
&gt;&gt; Many of the toxic chemicals
that are known to cause cancer

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:07.030
that we found in this report
were, in some cases, hundreds.

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:08.510
In other cases, thousands.

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:13.290
And in one case, 22 million
times over the EPA cancer risk.

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:15.930
&gt;&gt; These are enormous releases.

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:18.800
Many of these components
are neurotoxins.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.520
At high concentrations, they
can actually cause coma.

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:27.070
But at later concentrations, they
tend to reduce brain function.

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:30.550
The long-term effects,
the biggest one is cancer.

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:33.430
Because several of these
are known human carcinogens.

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:38.010
&gt;&gt; So when we started doing
the Bucket Brigade, this five,

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:40.950
six state Bucket Brigade,
we didn't intend

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:43.430
on doing the peer-reviewed article.

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:45.560 position:56%
We were just going to do the report.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:49.830
&gt;&gt; I became involved in the
fracking study when the groups

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:54.190
that had coordinated the
community-based activities

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:58.390
approached me for assistance
doing the statistical analysis

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:01.580
of the data, writing
up the publication,

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:04.340
and getting it published
in a peer-reviewed journal.

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:07.560
And whenever there is
this kind of study,

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.150
having a peer-reviewed
publication is sort

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:16.240
of the good housekeeping seal
of legitimacy of a study.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:20.310
&gt;&gt; What happens with citizen
science is everybody disses it.

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:23.330
So the peer-reviewed article
was extremely important

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:27.260
because it gave validity
to citizen science.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.450
&gt;&gt; I think that's why we
got taken so seriously,

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:33.990
that our journal article
had been published,

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:37.250
and this is what academic
scientists and doctors were saying

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:40.060
about the extreme hazard
from oil and gas development.

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:43.220
And there was widespread
coverage across the U.S.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:46.970
and actually globally of both the
peer-reviewed study and the report.

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:48.830
And it had a major impact.

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:50.800
&gt;&gt; I think the greatest influence

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:56.070
from the warning signs report
was for the ban in New York.

00:14:56.070 --> 00:15:00.190
&gt;&gt; Our fracking study was waved
by the commissioner of health

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:03.730
when he made the announcement
that the governor

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:07.010
of New York was banning fracking.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:12.690
&gt;&gt; Geoff Haines-Stiles: So the last
genre of citizen science I'm going

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:14.810
to talk about is really
more like crowd sourcing.

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:17.880
And this is where there's so much
data, rather than the lack of data

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.180
in the case of fracking

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:24.650
or the public lab work,
the Deepwater Horizon.

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:26.840
There is so much data
coming out of research lab

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:30.250
that you can crowd source it much
faster than the work could be done

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:31.690
by researchers themselves.

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:36.850
So this story is about the folks up
at Cornell who are looking to see

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:39.610
if they can figure out
the causes of Alzheimer's.

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:42.030
And they think it's reduced
blood flow in the brain.

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:43.700
They experiment on mice.

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:45.830
They take videos of mouse brains.

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:48.650
And they then have the problem
that it takes them a week

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:51.030
to capture the data, but
a year to analyze it.

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:52.590
So they've turned to the crowd.

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:55.130
They've borrowed from
or adapted examples

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:58.460
from successful gamified
citizen science projects,

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.920 position:56%
including the NASA Stardust Mission,

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:06.170 position:56%
where 30,000 people playing a game
were essentially able to find traces

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:09.910
of interstellar particles,
and EyeWire,

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:12.540
which is looking at
neurons in the brain.

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:16.660
Putting this together, they
were able to borrow from all

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:21.710
of the lessons of web games in
terms of having leader boards,

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:24.280
competition, fighting to
have your name up there

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:25.770
on the top of the leader board.

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:29.380
And this is how a citizen
science project was demoed

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:33.490 position:56%
in a retirement community in Florida
playing the store catcher's game.

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:36.230
You can see the excitement
that these senior citizens got

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:39.510
from trying to help speed
up Alzheimer's research.

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:43.240
[ Music ]

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:48.440
&gt;&gt; In late 2016, EyesOnALZ released
its Stall Catchers game based

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.540
on the Stardust Interface.

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:53.770
The public was invited to
help crowd source the analysis

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:56.100
of blocked blood vessels.

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:59.690
Some of the first players
were in Central Florida.

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:02.500
They were retirees who had
chosen the warm climate

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:05.430
in a community with plenty to do.

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:11.180
&gt;&gt; How many of you have family,
friends, somebody close to you

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:16.410
that either has or did have
Alzheimer's, or you have it?

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:18.220
Just about everybody, huh?

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:23.710
If only the scientists work on it,
it might take as much as 30 years.

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:27.440
And for most of us, that's
not going be a big benefit.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.730
This is what the game looks like.

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:34.020
And you can get it on your
phone, your tablet, your laptop.

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:35.320
&gt;&gt; Does the game change every day?

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.210
&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, they keep going.

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:39.550
They keep putting you through.

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:40.850
&gt;&gt; What do you think?

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:42.150
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:47.180 position:56%
&gt;&gt; How many think that it's flowing?

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:52.680
How many think it's stalled?

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.010
Shall we find out?

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:55.310
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:57.300
&gt;&gt; Well, try Stall then, okay?

00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:04.340
I've got 402 points.

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:06.680
Thank you very much.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:07.980
There we go.

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:09.280
We're climbing.

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:10.580
We're climbing.

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:11.880
Every time we find a stalled one

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.210
that is really stalled,
we are helping big time.

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:15.970
&gt;&gt; One of the things that I
like about this research is

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:20.820
that we can help my mother's
generation, but I'm 64.

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:23.730
And, you know, while
I want to help my mom,

00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:27.550
this is going to help,
I call kids, my age.

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:32.900
&gt;&gt; EyesOnALZ will keep on
refining its game play interface.

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:36.550
But its greatest impact on
Alzheimer's research will come

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:39.860
from the limitless
power of the crowd.

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:46.140
&gt;&gt; Geoff Haines-Stiles: So
one of the common questions

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:50.210
about citizen science is the
data quality reliable enough?

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:53.980
And the folks behind the
EyesOnALZ project worked on that,

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:56.240
and they have been able
to find that relative

00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:01.250
to laboratory grade research,
the crowd is doing very well.

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:03.270
Originally, they thought they
would have to have 20 members

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:05.620
of the crowd to validate
each result.

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:09.440
They've now gone down to 7 to
8 people, looking at each piece

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:12.030
of data to get quality results.

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:15.660
So data quality is often
raised about citizen science.

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:19.970
The quality of many citizen science
projects has been demonstrated

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:23.400
in statistics that I think any
of you would find convincing.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.160
While our series was on the
air back in April and May

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:30.310 position:56%
and PBS stations will be rerunning
it on into the next couple of years,

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:33.210
but just last weekend, we
did a global catch-a-thon,

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:36.240
modeled on the sort of
open street map map-a-thons

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.810
in which you give people
pizza, have them get together

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:40.970
to do a mapping of streets.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:44.390
This time, EyesOnALZ
coordinated a global effort,

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:47.080
22 teams in 6 different continents

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:51.130
on 6 different continents playing
a game within an hour to see

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:55.560
who could actually code the
largest number of stalls.

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:57.090
And you can see some
of the people there.

00:19:57.090 --> 00:20:03.120
Guatemala, El Salvador,
Chile, China, Brazil,

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.430
all around the world people
were online playing this game

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:08.900
when we did a live zoom
hangout to document that.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:11.000
The winners were actually
done in Chile.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.470
You can see that they annotated
1,955 examples of brain science,

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:20.510
and then they celebrated and
everybody got to share in that.

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:23.670
Citizen science has, in fact,
become a global phenomenon

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:26.410
with citizen science
associations in Australia,

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:30.460
and also in Europe
being very strong.

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:34.410
Some of the apps developed in Spain
are actually now being used here

00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:35.810
in the United States as well.

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:40.470
This is called mosquito alert
with the concern about Zika.

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:43.360
Anything that citizens
can do to report the areas

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:51.120
in which there is a breeding site
for mosquitoes is very important.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.920
This little video just shows
you that these are the sites

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:57.270
of traditional locations
of live traps.

00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:59.810
But they're fairly limited.

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:02.070
This is the number of
citizen science reports

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:04.230
that came in in Spain.

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:05.530
So my time is up.

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:07.130
Coffee break is looming.

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:10.290
I'm going to just zip over the
next few things just to say

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:15.720
that there is an NSF project
using $6 microscopes to attach

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.390
to the smart phones
that are also part

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:19.690
of today's citizen
science revolution.

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:24.150
And I'm skipping over that
and ending here by saying

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:27.460
that it's a revolution that is
happening, it's powered by people,

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:32.240
it is really answering concerns
that communities and citizens have.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:35.710
But it's using the tools of
science, it's generating data

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:40.410
from the environment, analyzing
it, collaborating with scientists,

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:43.050
and then delivering back
solutions that work.

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:46.990
So citizens plus sensors
working for solutions,

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:49.610
that's a pretty good summary of
what today's citizen science is.

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:53.160 position:56%
And Erna and I will be happy to talk
to anybody over the break about any

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.460
of the things we've just said.

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:56.950
So thanks very much Library of
Congress for putting this on.

00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:58.250
Delighted to be here.

00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:00.050
Thank you.

00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:02.570
[ Applause ]

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:06.220
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
