00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.235
Consider the numbers
1/3, 7, and negative 15.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.620
To which sets of
numbers, listed below,

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.890
does each of these
numbers belong?

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.230
And they give us a bunch of
different sets of numbers.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.521
And we could just review these.

00:00:15.521 --> 00:00:16.990
The natural numbers,
and you'll see

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.870
this used in different
contexts in different places,

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.760
but for the sake of
this video, we'll

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.020
assume this is counting numbers,
and it does not equal 0.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:31.345
So the natural numbers are 1,
2, 3, 4, and so on and so forth.

00:00:31.345 --> 00:00:33.470
We'll assume that the whole
numbers are essentially

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.340
the natural numbers plus 0.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.700
So the whole numbers are 0, 1,
2, 3, 4, so on and so forth.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.610
The integers we'll assume
it's the whole numbers

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.010
plus the opposite of
the natural numbers,

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.340
or the negative version
of the natural numbers.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.630
So we would go from
very negative values

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.700
to maybe negative 4,
negative 3, negative 2,

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:02.410
negative 1, 0, 1, 2, 3,
4, so on and so forth.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.890
Rational numbers.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.060
These are numbers
that can be expressed

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.900
as the ratio of two integers.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.680
So a rational number
can be expressed as m

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.380
over n, where both m
and n are integers.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.535
And of course n cannot be 0,
because anything divided by 0

00:01:21.535 --> 00:01:23.170
is not defined.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.740
M could be 0, and in fact,
0 is a rational number,

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.750
because 0 can be
represented as 0 over 1.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.220
Or really 0 over 2, or 0 over 3.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.450
I think you get the idea.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.350
Or 0 over negative 537.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.459
These are all
representations of 0,

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:43.500
and you have an integer
in the numerator, integer

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.520
in the denominator.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.340
So 0 is definitely
a rational number.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.830
You just can't have n, you can't
have the denominator, be 0.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.750
Irrational numbers are numbers
that cannot be expressed

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:53.830
in this way.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.610
And so common versions
of irrational numbers

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.690
are numbers that you will never
see digits that repeat on, go

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.550
on and on forever, or have
series of sequences of numbers

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.570
that keep repeating
on and on and on.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.520
And examples of irrational
numbers are square root of 2,

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.400
or pi.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.865
And the ratio of the
circumference, the diameter

00:02:14.865 --> 00:02:17.600
of a circle, or you might learn
about the irrational number

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.200
e, which is 2.71.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.580
And it keeps going,
and it doesn't repeat.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.420
And then real numbers are
really all of these combined.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.080
If you combine the
irrational numbers

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.730
and the rational
numbers, then you

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.520
are talking about
the real numbers.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.310
Every real number is either
rational or irrational.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.770
So let's classify
what we have up here.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:48.250
1/3 over here-- let me do that
in a different color-- so 1/3,

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.520
is it a natural number?

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.314
Well no, it's not.

00:02:50.314 --> 00:02:51.980
It's not just a natural
counting number.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:52.880
Is it a whole number?

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.620
No, it's not a whole number,
it's in fact a fraction.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.550
Is it an integer?

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.450
No once again, it
is not an integer.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.310
Is it a rational number?

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.110
Well sure it is.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.720
It can be represented
as 1 over 3.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.020
Both 1 and 3 are integers.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.050
So 1/3 is rational.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.260
And if something is rational,
it cannot be irrational.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.000
There's nothing that's both
rational and irrational.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.750
This literally
means not rational.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.155
And it is also a real number.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.210
Pretty much all of these are
going to be real numbers.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:28.280
Now, let's try 7 out.

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.360
So the number 7, it
is a natural number.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.480
It is just a regular
counting number.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.500
It is a whole number.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.930
Any natural number is also
going to be a whole number.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.920
And anything that is a
natural number that's

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.544
also going to be a whole number
is also going to be an integer.

00:03:48.544 --> 00:03:51.350
So this is also an integer.

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.600
And anything that is a natural
number, a whole number,

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.325
and integer, is also going
to be a rational number.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.540
And to see that, you
can write 7 as 7 over 1.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.970
In fact, you can
write any integer

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.010
as that number over 1, which
hopefully makes it obvious

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.320
that that is also
a rational number.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.450
And if it's rational,
you can't be irrational.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.180
That literally
means not rational.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.490
And then of course,
you're going to be real.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.890
It's going to be a real number.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.390
And you're going
to appreciate later

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.194
on in your mathematical
careers why we even

00:04:23.194 --> 00:04:25.360
go through the trouble of
saying it's a real number.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.180
Because as far as
it seems right now,

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.161
this kind of includes
all the numbers.

00:04:29.161 --> 00:04:30.910
What you're going to
see in the future is,

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.660
we're going to start
defining numbers that

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:33.940
don't fall into this category.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.850
And they're a little bit
philosophically interesting

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:36.530
as well.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.350
But anyway, back to the problem.

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.580
We have a negative 15.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.842
Negative 15 is not a natural
number, it's a negative number.

00:04:45.842 --> 00:04:47.675
So it's not a natural
number, natural number

00:04:47.675 --> 00:04:50.857
is only the positive
integers, we could say.

00:04:50.857 --> 00:04:52.440
Whole number, it's
not a whole number,

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.400
because that's just the
natural numbers and 0.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.240
It is an integer.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.030
It is the opposite
of positive 15.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.360
It is an integer.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.240
It is rational, it can be
represented as 15 over 1.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.710
So it is a rational.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.570
And because it is rational,
it cannot be rational.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.280
And of course, it is also real.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.430
And we are done.
