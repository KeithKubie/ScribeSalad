00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.790
So we just saw how to graph using
a table of values or a T-chart.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.200
Now let's talk about
graphing with intercepts.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.280
And first, let's meet John and
his mom and dad.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.140
And let's say that John borrows
money from his parents, in fact,

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.740
he borrows $200.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.090
And he promises that he's
going to pay back $10 a week.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.710
This is a classic case of needing math.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.710
Let's use a variable to
represent how much money

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.580
John still owes his
parents at a given time.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.050
In fact, let's use one of my favorites.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.050
Let's say y represents how much
money John owes his parents.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.360
Well, we can say that's
equal to 200-10x.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.120
And here, x represents the number of
weeks that have gone by since John's

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.710
gotten the loan from his parents.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.670
And this makes me think,
how much does John owe at week 0?

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.440
And how much does he owe at week 20?

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.745
And give your answers to these
questions here and here.

00:00:48.745 --> 00:00:52.539
