00:00:00.553 --> 00:00:03.722
In a basketball game, the Giraffes scored

00:00:03.722 --> 00:00:07.232
13 fewer points than the Penguins.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:12.270
The Penguins scored, the
Penguins scored 87 points.

00:00:13.588 --> 00:00:16.531
How many points did the Giraffes score?

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.542
Now before we even try to do this,

00:00:19.542 --> 00:00:22.447
let's just think that
based on what they told us,

00:00:22.447 --> 00:00:24.234
will the Giraffes score more points

00:00:24.234 --> 00:00:27.623
than the Penguins, or less
points than the Penguins?

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:29.293
Well, they tell us.

00:00:29.293 --> 00:00:32.906
The Giraffes scored 13 fewer points.

00:00:33.194 --> 00:00:37.681
13 fewer, fewer points than the Penguins.

00:00:37.806 --> 00:00:41.215
So the Giraffes scored less
points than the Penguins.

00:00:41.424 --> 00:00:43.557
So whatever number is here, the Giraffes,

00:00:43.557 --> 00:00:46.050
this is gonna be less than 87.

00:00:46.197 --> 00:00:48.773
Because the Penguins scored 87 points.

00:00:49.102 --> 00:00:50.479
And how much less is it?

00:00:50.627 --> 00:00:52.183
Well, it's gonna be 13 less.

00:00:52.183 --> 00:00:53.944
It's gonna be 13 fewer.

00:00:54.193 --> 00:00:56.672
So this right over here,
this right over here

00:00:56.672 --> 00:00:58.313
is whatever the Penguins scored.

00:00:58.581 --> 00:01:01.868
Whatever the penguins scored,
which they tell us is 87,

00:01:02.077 --> 00:01:04.286
cause they tell us the
Penguins scored 87 points,

00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:06.424
it's gonna be 13 fewer than that,

00:01:06.424 --> 00:01:08.248
or 13 less than that.

00:01:08.476 --> 00:01:12.128
So it's going to be 87 minus 13 points.

00:01:12.255 --> 00:01:13.794
So let's figure out what that is.

00:01:14.653 --> 00:01:17.737
So the Penguins scored 87 points,

00:01:18.614 --> 00:01:23.450
and the Giraffes scored 13 fewer.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.863
So if we subtract 13 from the 87,

00:01:26.863 --> 00:01:28.753
that's going to give
us the number of points

00:01:28.753 --> 00:01:30.434
that the Giraffes scored.

00:01:30.621 --> 00:01:31.998
So what is that going to be?

00:01:32.511 --> 00:01:34.136
Let's see, let's look at the ones place.

00:01:34.136 --> 00:01:38.642
Seven ones minus three ones is four ones.

00:01:39.074 --> 00:01:40.374
Now go to the tens place.

00:01:40.374 --> 00:01:44.168
Eight tens minus one ten is seven tens.

00:01:44.904 --> 00:01:49.064
So 13 fewer than 87 is 74 points.

00:01:49.314 --> 00:01:51.751
And the Giraffes scored 13
fewer than the Penguins,

00:01:51.751 --> 00:01:53.087
this is the Penguins,

00:01:53.315 --> 00:01:55.769
this is what the Penguins
scored right over here.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.801
And the Giraffes scored
13 fewer than that,

00:01:58.801 --> 00:02:03.801
so that is going to be 74 points.

00:02:05.038 --> 00:02:05.954
And it makes sense.

00:02:05.954 --> 00:02:09.808
74 is 13 fewer than 87.
