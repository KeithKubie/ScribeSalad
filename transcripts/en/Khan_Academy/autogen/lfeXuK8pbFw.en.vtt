00:00:00.186 --> 00:00:02.260
 When we first studied glycolysis, 

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.255
 we saw that if we started with a glucose molecule 

00:00:05.255 --> 00:00:08.125
 and the process has gone - 

00:00:08.125 --> 00:00:10.904
 glucose, which contains six carbon atoms, 

00:00:10.904 --> 00:00:12.592
 there are also oxygen and water atoms, 

00:00:12.592 --> 00:00:14.110
 but it's six-carbon sugar. 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.643
 This six-carbon sugar 

00:00:16.643 --> 00:00:19.713
 is divided into two pyruvate molecules, each of which has three carbon atoms. 

00:00:19.713 --> 00:00:22.679
 We produce net in this process 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:25.584
 two molecules of ATP. 

00:00:25.584 --> 00:00:27.816
 We invest two ATP molecules in the first phase, 

00:00:27.816 --> 00:00:30.777
 then produce four ATP molecules. 

00:00:30.777 --> 00:00:34.166
 We generally win two ATF molecules. 

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:36.186
 But this is not the only thing that happens. 

00:00:36.186 --> 00:00:39.679
 We also have two molecules NAD - 

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:42.831
 nicotinamidadendinucleotide. 

00:00:42.831 --> 00:00:45.872
 NAD is reduced to NAD. 

00:00:45.872 --> 00:00:47.081
 Why is it reduced? 

00:00:47.081 --> 00:00:50.167
 Here we see that NAD has a positive charge, 

00:00:50.167 --> 00:00:53.116
 but becomes a neutral molecule when it receives electrons. 

00:00:53.116 --> 00:00:57.300
 Here it is reduced. 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.079
 Your next question may be, 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.009
 "What happens next?". 

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:04.374
 If this process takes place in me or in you, 

00:01:04.374 --> 00:01:06.910
 if we have enough oxygen, 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.742
 we will continue with cellular respiration. 

00:01:08.742 --> 00:01:10.454
 The processes will be transferred to the mitochondria, 

00:01:10.454 --> 00:01:13.594
 because molecules pyruvate and NADN can be 

00:01:13.594 --> 00:01:16.243
 used to drive more ATPs. 

00:01:16.243 --> 00:01:18.656
 Pyruvate continues to degrade 

00:01:18.656 --> 00:01:22.140
 in the Krebs cycle, also known as the citric acid cycle. 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.984
 In this porcelain is produced ATP and NADN. 

00:01:25.984 --> 00:01:27.745
 NAM can participate 

00:01:27.745 --> 00:01:29.947
 in the electron transport chain, 

00:01:29.947 --> 00:01:32.751
 resulting in the production of even more ATP. 

00:01:32.751 --> 00:01:34.019
 But if we are in a situation, 

00:01:34.019 --> 00:01:35.412
 where we do not have oxygen 

00:01:35.412 --> 00:01:38.615
 or if we are an organism, 

00:01:38.615 --> 00:01:40.980
 who does not like to use oxygen 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.034
 or does not know how to use it, what happens then? 

00:01:44.034 --> 00:01:45.844
 This is what we will be talking about in this video. 

00:01:45.844 --> 00:01:47.736
 This is one of the possible paths. 

00:01:47.736 --> 00:01:50.816
 This is the lactic acid fermentation. 

00:01:50.816 --> 00:01:53.177
 It is one of the two main types of fermentation. 

00:01:53.177 --> 00:01:57.128
 Lactic acid fermentation. 

00:01:57.128 --> 00:02:00.158
 Lactic acid fermentation. 

00:02:00.158 --> 00:02:02.363
 Lactic acid fermentation. 

00:02:02.363 --> 00:02:06.241
 In lactic acid fermentation, the main goal is not 

00:02:06.241 --> 00:02:09.044
 to produce more ATPs and yes 

00:02:09.044 --> 00:02:10.857
 recycle pyruvate and NADH. 

00:02:10.857 --> 00:02:13.140
 Although pyruvate and NADN 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.533
 have free energy that can turn into ATP, 

00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:19.711
 if we have lactic acid fermentation, 

00:02:19.711 --> 00:02:21.713
 we give up this energy. 

00:02:21.713 --> 00:02:23.940
 In fact, we will use pyruvate, 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.374
 to oxidize NAD 

00:02:26.374 --> 00:02:28.704
 to +. 

00:02:28.704 --> 00:02:32.654
 Thus, we get even more + so that glycolysis can flow again. 

00:02:32.654 --> 00:02:35.201
 Organisms in which fermentation takes place 

00:02:35.201 --> 00:02:38.171
 use glycolysis as a major source of energy. 

00:02:38.171 --> 00:02:41.246
 As we have said, the purpose of fermentation is recycling 

00:02:41.246 --> 00:02:44.670
 of what is considered waste in this case - the NADN, 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.483
 to get over + 

00:02:46.483 --> 00:02:48.979
 and allow glycolysis to flow again. 

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:51.950
 Now you can say, "Oh, that's probably a strange thing, 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.676
 which is not common in living nature. " 

00:02:54.676 --> 00:02:57.110
 But actually maybe every day or every week 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.717
 you consume organisms that 

00:02:59.717 --> 00:03:02.330
 perform lactic-acidic fermentation. 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.400
 Here's a picture of yogurt. 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.377
 We get yogurt when 

00:03:08.377 --> 00:03:12.745
 certain types of lactobacilli digest sugars in milk. 

00:03:12.745 --> 00:03:15.177
 They do glycolysis 

00:03:15.177 --> 00:03:18.097
 and then passed to lactic acid fermentation, 

00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:21.512
 turning pyruvate into lactate. 

00:03:21.512 --> 00:03:25.002
 Or if we look at the acids - 

00:03:25.002 --> 00:03:28.451
 lactic acid or pyruvic acid. 

00:03:28.451 --> 00:03:32.047
 Pyruvate is the major part of pyruvic acid. 

00:03:32.047 --> 00:03:35.666
 A lactate - the lactic acid. 

00:03:35.666 --> 00:03:38.418
 It is what gives yogurt 

00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:40.311
 its unique taste. 

00:03:40.311 --> 00:03:43.747
 This bacterium here - 

00:03:43.747 --> 00:03:44.612
 lactobacilli. 

00:03:44.612 --> 00:03:46.886
 This is only one type of lactobacilli. 

00:03:46.886 --> 00:03:49.597
 There are different types 

00:03:49.597 --> 00:03:51.457
 everyone involved in the production of these foods. 

00:03:51.457 --> 00:03:53.346
 But this one is for yogurt. 

00:03:53.346 --> 00:03:55.582
 If you like Korean food, here is kimchi, 

00:03:55.582 --> 00:03:58.107
 it uses another type of lactobacilli 

00:03:58.107 --> 00:04:01.493
 and also lactic-acidic fermentation 

00:04:01.493 --> 00:04:03.356
 of sugars in vegetables. 

00:04:03.356 --> 00:04:05.480
 This here is sour cabbage, 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.067
 we have another type of lactobacilli, 

00:04:09.067 --> 00:04:12.144
 which performs lactic-acidic fermentation 

00:04:12.144 --> 00:04:13.660
 of cabbage sugars. 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.037
 So we get sour cabbage. 

00:04:16.037 --> 00:04:17.819
 - 

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:20.752
 Think about the processes that are going on. 

00:04:20.752 --> 00:04:24.445
 As I said, we have 

00:04:24.445 --> 00:04:26.619
 pyruvate or pyruvic acid (pyruvic acid). 

00:04:26.619 --> 00:04:29.712
 What I drew here 

00:04:29.712 --> 00:04:34.311
 is pyruvic acid, 

00:04:34.311 --> 00:04:35.687
 - 

00:04:35.687 --> 00:04:38.133
 because we have a hydrogen proton. 

00:04:38.133 --> 00:04:39.515
 If we lose the hydrogen proton, 

00:04:39.515 --> 00:04:41.648
 it's the same thing painted again, 

00:04:41.648 --> 00:04:43.708
 but without the hydrogen proton. 

00:04:43.708 --> 00:04:45.852
 This oxygen kept this electron. 

00:04:45.852 --> 00:04:48.443
 All other hydrogen atoms 

00:04:48.443 --> 00:04:49.510
 are implied. 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:50.919
 The three hydrogen atoms 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:52.771
 this carbon atom is implied. 

00:04:52.771 --> 00:04:54.673
 Here I paint the same thing with a different recording. 

00:04:54.673 --> 00:04:57.282
 Here we have lost the proton 

00:04:57.282 --> 00:04:59.321
 and we will call this compound pyruvate. 

00:04:59.321 --> 00:05:03.062
 They're drinking. 

00:05:03.062 --> 00:05:04.696
 Pyruvate acid or 

00:05:04.696 --> 00:05:07.222
 pyruvate 

00:05:07.222 --> 00:05:10.907
 are used for NADH oxidation. 

00:05:10.907 --> 00:05:14.886
 They take their hydride anion, they take an electron, 

00:05:14.886 --> 00:05:18.707
 actually take more than one electron, 

00:05:18.707 --> 00:05:21.634
 overall NAD loses electrons. 

00:05:21.634 --> 00:05:25.138
 If he loses electrons, 

00:05:25.138 --> 00:05:27.522
 it is oxidized. 

00:05:28.581 --> 00:05:32.392
 Thus, NAD + can be used again in glycolysis. 

00:05:32.392 --> 00:05:35.608
 When the pyruvic acid interacts with NADH, 

00:05:35.608 --> 00:05:38.041
 it is reduced. 

00:05:39.191 --> 00:05:40.696
 It is reduced, 

00:05:41.946 --> 00:05:44.483
 receives electrons. 

00:05:44.483 --> 00:05:46.724
 If we think of the acid, 

00:05:46.724 --> 00:05:50.060
 it will turn into this here - lactic acid. 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.595
 Milk 

00:05:51.595 --> 00:05:53.686
 acid. 

00:05:53.686 --> 00:05:55.177
 Lactic acid. 

00:05:55.177 --> 00:05:57.952
 That is why we call the process of lactic acid fermentation, 

00:05:57.952 --> 00:05:59.377
 because we take pyruvate - 

00:05:59.377 --> 00:06:01.230
 if we had oxygen, or if the body knew how to use it, 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.507
 perhaps the process would continue 

00:06:03.507 --> 00:06:05.756
 to cell breathing and to use this energy. 

00:06:05.756 --> 00:06:07.485
 But with lactic acid fermentation, 

00:06:07.485 --> 00:06:10.693
 we use pyruvate to oxidize NAD 

00:06:10.693 --> 00:06:12.908
 and get even more +. 

00:06:12.908 --> 00:06:14.820
 Let's look at what exactly 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.070
 happens. 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.609
 The first thing I want to show you, 

00:06:18.609 --> 00:06:20.267
 because very often in biology classes 

00:06:20.267 --> 00:06:22.725
 learns about NAD and NADN, 

00:06:22.725 --> 00:06:25.140
 but it looks like a very abstract molecule. 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.252
 This is a drawing of the molecule. 

00:06:26.252 --> 00:06:29.250
 This is nicotinamidadendinucleotide. 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.416
 A long name, 

00:06:31.416 --> 00:06:33.608
 but when we divide it into parts, we can understand what it means. 

00:06:33.608 --> 00:06:35.200
 - 

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.895
 This is where it comes from 

00:06:37.895 --> 00:06:40.039
 nicotinamide. 

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:42.550
 This is our good friend Aden. 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.016
 We see it in the ATF, 

00:06:45.016 --> 00:06:48.389
 as well as one of the nitrogen bases in DNA and RNA. 

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:50.684
 Here we have ribose. 

00:06:50.684 --> 00:06:52.074
 - 

00:06:52.074 --> 00:06:54.867
 We have a phosphate group. 

00:06:54.867 --> 00:06:57.651
 Thus, nicotinamide, adenine, 

00:06:57.651 --> 00:07:00.581
 we have a nucleotide here 

00:07:00.581 --> 00:07:03.640
 we also have another nucleotide. 

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.036
 Thus we get nicotinamidadendinucleotide. 

00:07:07.036 --> 00:07:08.336
 So the name is very logical. 

00:07:08.336 --> 00:07:09.514
 I wanted to show it visually, 

00:07:09.514 --> 00:07:10.962
 To Understand, 

00:07:10.962 --> 00:07:15.518
 it's a pretty complex molecule. 

00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:17.683
 Sometimes you only see the letters NAD 

00:07:17.683 --> 00:07:19.544
 and you do not understand what the molecule really is. 

00:07:19.544 --> 00:07:22.275
 It is coenzyme. 

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:24.281
 We learned about coenzymes in other videos. 

00:07:24.281 --> 00:07:27.058
 The enzyme that catalyses this reaction is 

00:07:27.058 --> 00:07:29.403
 lactic acid dehydrogenase. 

00:07:29.403 --> 00:07:31.924
 Remember most 

00:07:31.924 --> 00:07:36.610
 of the enzymes are large protein structures, 

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:40.938
 folded in different ways. 

00:07:40.938 --> 00:07:43.445
 Then we have NAD. 

00:07:43.445 --> 00:07:46.010
 In the case of lactic acid fermentation, 

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:50.168
 we have NADN, 

00:07:50.168 --> 00:07:54.540
 this is NAD. 

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.664
 I draw roughly how NADH would look like. 

00:07:56.664 --> 00:07:58.425
 The drawing is not accurate. 

00:07:58.425 --> 00:08:02.352
 He will react with the feather. 

00:08:02.352 --> 00:08:04.032
 - 

00:08:04.971 --> 00:08:09.203
 Will react with pyruvate, 

00:08:09.203 --> 00:08:11.618
 although the pyruvate 

00:08:11.618 --> 00:08:12.848
 is officially considered 

00:08:12.848 --> 00:08:14.579
 for the substrate of the enzyme, 

00:08:14.579 --> 00:08:19.315
 the whole purpose of the process is to oxidize NAD. 

00:08:19.315 --> 00:08:22.381
 NOD to lose a hydrogen proton and an additional electron. 

00:08:22.381 --> 00:08:24.375
 So, a hydrogen proton, a hydrogen electron 

00:08:24.375 --> 00:08:25.644
 and another electron. 

00:08:25.644 --> 00:08:27.557
 Lose a hydride anion. 

00:08:27.557 --> 00:08:29.088
 How does this happen? 

00:08:29.088 --> 00:08:32.652
 It happens because nitrogen 

00:08:32.652 --> 00:08:34.978
 there is an additional free e-pair 

00:08:34.978 --> 00:08:38.743
 and this electron pair may form a double bond 

00:08:38.743 --> 00:08:40.073
 right here. 

00:08:40.073 --> 00:08:42.942
 If this carbon now has a double bond, 

00:08:42.942 --> 00:08:45.176
 this carbon atom must be released from this double bond. 

00:08:45.176 --> 00:08:47.651
 Therefore, this comes here. 

00:08:47.651 --> 00:08:51.182
 This comes here. 

00:08:51.182 --> 00:08:54.044
 And now, if we have a double connection here, 

00:08:54.044 --> 00:08:55.548
 we see it in the final product, 

00:08:55.548 --> 00:08:57.409
 this carbon atom will have to release one of its links. 

00:08:57.409 --> 00:09:00.318
 He will free himself from the whole covalent bond 

00:09:00.318 --> 00:09:02.917
 with this hydrogen atom of both electrons. 

00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:06.884
 These two electrons will be released. 

00:09:06.884 --> 00:09:08.211
 Those here. 

00:09:08.211 --> 00:09:10.221
 Then these two electrons 

00:09:10.221 --> 00:09:14.812
 can be linked to this carbon here. 

00:09:14.812 --> 00:09:17.748
 Once this carbon atom forms a new covalent bond, 

00:09:17.748 --> 00:09:20.004
 you have to get rid of one of your old ties. 

00:09:20.004 --> 00:09:23.315
 That's why he's released 

00:09:23.315 --> 00:09:25.060
 by one of its double bonds with this oxygen atom. 

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.402
 It can return to that oxygen 

00:09:27.402 --> 00:09:30.283
 or find a hydrogen proton 

00:09:30.283 --> 00:09:34.341
 by a passing water molecule or by a hydroxone ion. 

00:09:34.341 --> 00:09:37.179
 I can draw this. 

00:09:37.179 --> 00:09:40.950
 He can grab a hydrogen proton. 

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:42.843
 So, what do we get? 

00:09:42.843 --> 00:09:47.344
 This e-pair is already here, 

00:09:47.344 --> 00:09:49.695
 we have a double link here, 

00:09:49.695 --> 00:09:51.247
 we have lost one of these hydrogen atoms, 

00:09:51.247 --> 00:09:52.785
 obviously I have not painted all the water atoms 

00:09:52.785 --> 00:09:54.042
 in these molecules. 

00:09:54.042 --> 00:09:57.716
 So now we are back to NAD. 

00:09:57.716 --> 00:10:01.336
 This nitrogen atom 

00:10:01.336 --> 00:10:03.768
 was neutral, 

00:10:03.768 --> 00:10:05.377
 but now he has not kept these two electrons for himself, 

00:10:05.377 --> 00:10:06.908
 but it shares them, 

00:10:06.908 --> 00:10:09.644
 therefore, will have a positive charge. 

00:10:09.644 --> 00:10:13.370
 So we call the compound NAD +. 

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:16.144
 NAD has lost hydrogen and an electron, 

00:10:16.144 --> 00:10:19.146
 Hydrogen proton, hydrogen electron and another electron. 

00:10:19.146 --> 00:10:23.064
 Now there is a positive charge. 

00:10:23.064 --> 00:10:27.207
 And pyruvate is now the compound, 

00:10:27.207 --> 00:10:29.086
 which I drew here. 

00:10:29.086 --> 00:10:30.964
 I display it deprotonated. 

00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:33.852
 It's a lactate. 

00:10:33.852 --> 00:10:35.074
 Lactate. 

00:10:35.074 --> 00:10:37.006
 If we had a proton here, 

00:10:37.006 --> 00:10:40.847
 it would be lactic acid. 

00:10:40.847 --> 00:10:43.777
 I hope this video was interesting, 

00:10:43.777 --> 00:10:45.908
 I find it very interesting 

00:10:45.908 --> 00:10:47.142
 to understand how all these processes are going. 

00:10:47.142 --> 00:10:50.603
 Lactobacilli are not the only organisms that use lactic acid fermentation, 

00:10:50.603 --> 00:10:53.009
 but are useful for the most diverse 

00:10:53.009 --> 00:10:56.105
 delicious foods we produce. 

00:10:56.105 --> 00:10:57.350
 Remarkably, 

00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:59.338
 that these 

00:10:59.338 --> 00:11:01.824
 complex processes are running constantly 

00:11:01.824 --> 00:11:02.891
 in the glory around us, 

00:11:02.891 --> 00:11:04.582
 and sometimes in our own bodies, 

00:11:04.582 --> 00:11:07.641
 as well as in these small organisms. 

00:11:07.641 --> 00:11:10.053
 For example, this lactobacilli here 

00:11:10.053 --> 00:11:13.244
 has a size between 

00:11:13.244 --> 00:11:15.349
 five and ten micrometers. 

00:11:15.349 --> 00:11:20.258
 Five micrometres are five millionth of a meter.
