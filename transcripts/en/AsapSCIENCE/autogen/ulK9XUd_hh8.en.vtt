00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.759
 Parasites have a bad reputation - but is it really fair to fear these small parasites? Okay, 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.009
 Yes - and if you do not think so, here are the reasons why these horrible creatures deserve to be avoided 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:11.410
 At all costs! 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.559
 As if you need another reason to hate mosquitoes - when the mosquito bites the human they can leave the larvae 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:20.200
 Of parasitic worm Filaria. These worms live and grow in our bodies, sometimes you need 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.940
 For years to mature full puberty, skin rash and sores are not only obvious. Years 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.080
 Later, worms work together to block the blood vessels of the lymphatic system, creating accumulation 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.320
 Of fluids that lead to diseases such as elephant disease. It is one of the main causes of disability 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.570
 In the world 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.510
 Another worm worth the ball is the pin. Pork eggs are often eaten because 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.809
 The hands are dirty or contaminated. Leading to the reduction of eggs and maturity in the intestines where the worm 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:50.339
 Get out of the anus to put a new batch of eggs on the surrounding skin. Making the anus area 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:56.089
 Asha for them! This causes severe itching, often leading to hands or nails to be contaminated again, 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:00.659
 Which can eventually make it into your mouth again, resulting in a reboot cycle. You feel itching in your ass? 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:03.929
 Do yourself a favor and wash those hands and nails! 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:08.560
 On the other side of the body, live pubic lice - sometimes called "crab" for some reason 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.990
 It is not uncommon to find these trivial creatures in eyebrows, beard or even eyelashes. 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.560
 Itching is an allergic reaction to lice lice, and it needs treatment with medication 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.410
 Or shaving to get rid of them. Of course, abstinence works well 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.040
 As a precautionary measure, along with non-engagement underwear with other people. 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.930
 Some parasites are particular to marine animals, but eventually come to humans through good in 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.310
 Our eyes? Necrotic nematodes infect humans after eating raw or poorly cooked fish - such as 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.850
 Sushi - which contains the larvae. The worms penetrate our intestinal wall and cause 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.940
 Abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. But, no one really wins, because nematodes can not 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.410
 Mature into the human intestines and eventually die. 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.570
 Tongue is another marine parasite. Lent eat the tongue 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.350
 Fish appropriate and chew off the fish tongue, to cling to its place. Here they stay 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.120
 They feed on the fish's blood, while at the same time their offspring mate and spread 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.540
 Ocean 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.540
 Finally, Cordyceps is a wonderful fungus known for creating zombie ants. 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.840
 The fungi control the body around the ants and the mind, making it leave the colony and begin climbing 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.819
 The upward to the temperature and humidity are more ideal. Then the ant bite on the leg or leaves 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.379
 Which leads to the imprisonment of the fungus until he dies. At this point, the mushrooms rush through 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:23.549
 Head ants and spread out. 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:28.230
 Can these parasites ever affect humans? For everyone, hope not! 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.409
 Our friends at James Cook University helped us to put this terrifying list of parasites together, 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:36.900
 With special help from the world of parasites Dr. Kate Hatson. JCU is one of the leading institutes in the world 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.159
 In focus on the tropics with the opportunity to study in various 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:45.709
 Environmental areas are unmatched by any university in the world. I studied there for a while 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:51.629
 Classroom abroad! If you want to learn more, visit the university website jcu.edu.au
