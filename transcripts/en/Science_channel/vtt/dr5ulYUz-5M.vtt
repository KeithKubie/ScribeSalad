00:00:00.868 --> 00:00:03.100
♪♪

00:00:05.033 --> 00:00:06.801
YEAH, I WAS A BIG SCIENCE NERD.

00:00:06.801 --> 00:00:08.534
DEFINITELY A VIRGIN.

00:00:08.534 --> 00:00:10.234
THAT'S ME.

00:00:10.234 --> 00:00:11.868
I WENT TO SPACE CAMP
FOR FOUR YEARS.

00:00:11.868 --> 00:00:13.834
I COULD GO ON AND ON ABOUT THAT,
BUT I DON'T...

00:00:13.834 --> 00:00:16.801
I DON'T THINK THAT POPULARITY

00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:20.701
WAS MAYBE AT THE TOP OF MY
PRIORITY LIST IN HIGH SCHOOL.

00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:25.033
I WAS LIKE, "WHY BE POPULAR
WHEN YOU COULD DISSECT FROGS?"

00:00:25.033 --> 00:00:27.601
[ British accent ]
WELL, I GREW UP LIKING SCIENCE

00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:29.801
AND THEN WENT ON
TO DO A MATH DEGREE --

00:00:29.801 --> 00:00:32.701
OR MATHS DEGREE,
AS YOU CALL IT IN MY COUNTRY.

00:00:32.701 --> 00:00:34.801
SO I WAS PRETTY COOL.

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:36.801
I THINK ALL THE OTHER KIDS
IN THE CLASS WERE LIKE,

00:00:36.801 --> 00:00:40.434
"YEAH, THAT KID
WHO'S PRETTY GOOD AT PHYSICS,

00:00:40.434 --> 00:00:43.000
HE'S THE ONE TO HANG OUT WITH."

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.133
SCIENTISTS ARE BOTH NERDY
AND HOT.

00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:47.033
I MEAN, THEY HAVE TO BE NERDY.

00:00:47.033 --> 00:00:48.801
TO BE NERDY JUST MEANS
YOU'RE REALLY PASSIONATE

00:00:48.801 --> 00:00:49.868
ABOUT SOMETHING,

00:00:49.868 --> 00:00:51.501
AND YOU JUST WANT
TO KEEP DRIVING

00:00:51.501 --> 00:00:52.868
TO FIND OUT
MORE AND MORE ABOUT IT

00:00:52.868 --> 00:00:54.167
AND MAKE IT
MORE A PART OF YOUR LIFE.

00:00:54.167 --> 00:00:56.434
THAT, TO ME,
IS HOT AND ATTRACTIVE.

00:00:56.434 --> 00:00:57.734
IF YOU'RE PASSIONATE
ABOUT SOMETHING,

00:00:57.734 --> 00:00:59.834
THAT'S, LIKE, THE GREATEST
QUALITY YOU COULD HAVE.

00:00:59.834 --> 00:01:01.667
AND BEING ABLE
TO WEAR THE UNIFORM --

00:01:01.667 --> 00:01:03.300
IT SOMETIMES HELPS
WITH THE LADIES.
