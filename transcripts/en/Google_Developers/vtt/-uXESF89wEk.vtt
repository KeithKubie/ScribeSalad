00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.630
I use Google Maps every day.

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.550
When I'm navigating the subways,
making dinner reservations,

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.360
grabbing a taxi, I
don't have to think

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.660
about how it works,
if it's going to work,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.070
whether or not it's accurate.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.240
Using the Google Maps
APIs in a website

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.760
means bringing that familiarity
and trust to your users.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.400
It means that while reaching
users across the world,

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.910
everybody gets accurate global
data that's familiar to them.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.520
You can learn how to integrate
Google's location services

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.920
and maps into your websites
through Udacity and Google's

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.250
Maps APIs course.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.880
Learn to create intuitive
map visualizations,

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.530
utilize our detailed
places of interest data,

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.970
and lead your users
where they need to go.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.940
When you use the
Google Maps APIs,

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.580
you bring the reliable and
simple experience of Google

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.630
to everything you build.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.790
