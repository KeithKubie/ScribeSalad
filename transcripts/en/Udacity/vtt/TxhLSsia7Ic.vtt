00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.270
Congratulations on
finishing the first level.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.240
You've learned a little
bit about game engines,

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.280
gaming platforms, how to break a game
down into its component parts, and

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.170
how LibGDX allows you to
write cross platform games.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.970
Finally, you made sure you were
set up for success in this course.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.090
Well, sorry for making you stare
at my face so much in this level.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.510
That won't be a problem
in future levels,

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.770
since you'll actually be programming
instead of staring at me.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.190
In the next level you'll set up your
tools, load up your first LibGDX project

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.130
and get your first game running on
your computer and on your phone.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.370
The next two levels
are all about drawing.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.690
You'll learn about the computer drawing
pipeline, draw some simple shapes, and

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.070
to spice things up a bit,
we'll also be drawing some fractals.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.610
Level five is all about making those
shapes move around the screen.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.200
We'll learn about the game loop and

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.930
we'll also set up some
cool fake physics.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.710
In level six, we'll learn how to
handle user inputs including touches,

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.710
key presses and device orientation.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.320
Level seven and eight will wrap
together everything you've learned so

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.770
far into the finished game.
