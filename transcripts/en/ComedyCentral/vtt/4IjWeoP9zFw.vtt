  - What's up guys?

I'm Matt FX, Music
Supervisor of Broad City

00:00:16.148 --> 00:00:18.684
and here's our recap for
episodes two and three,

00:00:18.717 --> 00:00:20.787
 Pussy Weed and Working Girls.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.557 size:88% position:44%
 First up, we've got a track
 called 1977 by Ana Tijoux.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.726 align:start size:88% position:13%
 1977 is a very cool
 Latin rap track,

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:29.529
 running under the cold
 open of Working Girls.

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:31.330 size:88% position:44%
 It's a really great kinda
 identity piece in the show,

00:00:31.363 --> 00:00:33.166 align:start size:88% position:13%
kind of showing how
the two different girls

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:34.333
 go about their days.

00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.069 size:88% position:44%
 Obviously Ilana's
 a bit of a slacker,

00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:37.804
Abbi's a bit of an overachiever.

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:39.806 align:start position:0%
 Gotten a lot of really great
 feedback on this track,

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:42.141 align:start position:0%
 so we're really happy to
 feature it in this episode.

00:00:42.174 --> 00:00:45.412
 ("1977" by Ana Tijoux)

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:58.791
 Secondly, we're gonna
 feature a bit about

00:00:58.824 --> 00:01:00.693 size:88% position:44%
  an artist named Hot Sugar.

00:01:00.726 --> 00:01:02.662 align:start position:0%
  Hot Sugar is a producer
  who's worked with everyone

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:04.297
 from The Roots to Das Racist.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.366 align:start position:0%
He makes incredibly interesting,
unique hip hop beats

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:10.136
 that have an almost Willy
 Wonka sort of magic to them.

00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:11.637 align:start size:88% position:13%
 He's actually someone
 who has given us

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.573
 a bunch of music for the show,
 all of which is unreleased,

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:15.575
 so I can't even give
 you track titles.

00:01:15.608 --> 00:01:17.677
 I can tell you that his music
 is in a bunch of transitions

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.312 size:88% position:44%
  in episode three
  as well as some of

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:21.114 align:start size:88% position:13%
  the later episodes
  in the season.

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:22.315 size:88% position:44%
  Next up, we've got another

00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:23.783 align:start size:88% position:13%
 featured transition
 in episode three

00:01:23.816 --> 00:01:27.520 size:84% position:42%
  in the instrumental dub
  of Badman by Doctor Jeep.

00:01:27.553 --> 00:01:29.088 size:84% position:42%
  We feature Badman
  in a transition,

00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:31.691
right before Ilana's in
the train with the cops.

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:33.059
 The cops are just walking by

00:01:33.092 --> 00:01:35.061 align:start size:88% position:13%
 while she's a
 little uncomfortable

00:01:35.094 --> 00:01:37.130 size:84% position:42%
  hiding contraband
  within her purse.

00:01:37.163 --> 00:01:39.298
Perfect idea to use this
track as it starts off

00:01:39.331 --> 00:01:42.068
 with a little siren woop and
 having the cops walking by

00:01:42.101 --> 00:01:43.503
just fits real nicely together.

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:46.239 size:88% position:44%
 (siren and heavy base beat)

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:50.210
 (train moving down the track)

00:01:52.878 --> 00:01:54.280
Last song featured in this recap

00:01:54.313 --> 00:01:56.182
 is another episode three jam,

00:01:56.215 --> 00:01:59.752 align:start size:88% position:13%
 See You Leave by
 the inimitable RJD2.

00:01:59.785 --> 00:02:02.054
 See You Leave is running in
 the dentist waiting room scene

00:02:02.087 --> 00:02:05.057 size:88% position:44%
 as Abbi's waiting for Ilana
 to get out of a procedure.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.559 size:88% position:44%
 It's a really early
 scene in our season

00:02:06.592 --> 00:02:09.162
 where we get to show
 Abbi's fun-loving side

00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:13.399 size:88% position:44%
  and I think RJD2's kind of
  fun, slow, humble groove

00:02:13.432 --> 00:02:16.102
 was just a perfect fit
 for her personality.

00:02:16.135 --> 00:02:19.639 size:84% position:42%
  ("See You Leave" by RJD2)

00:02:30.816 --> 00:02:34.120 align:start position:0%
And that was our catch-up recap
for episodes two and three,

00:02:34.153 --> 00:02:36.088
 Pussy Weed and Working Girls.

00:02:36.121 --> 00:02:37.423
