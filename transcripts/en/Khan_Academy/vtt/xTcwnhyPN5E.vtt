00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.153
- [Voiceover] Let's see if we can find

00:00:01.153 --> 00:00:02.805
the area of this parallelogram,

00:00:02.805 --> 00:00:04.150
and I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.159
and see if you can figure
it out on your own.

00:00:06.949 --> 00:00:08.553
Well, we just have to remind ourselves

00:00:08.553 --> 00:00:10.165
that the area of a parallelogram

00:00:10.165 --> 00:00:12.344
is just going to be the base --

00:00:12.344 --> 00:00:13.821
let me do this in different colors --

00:00:13.821 --> 00:00:16.375
it's going to be the base
of the parallelogram,

00:00:16.375 --> 00:00:18.256
so I want to do that in a different color,

00:00:18.256 --> 00:00:19.432
so let me write:

00:00:19.432 --> 00:00:23.172
the base of the parallelogram

00:00:23.172 --> 00:00:26.036
times the height of the parallelogram,

00:00:26.036 --> 00:00:30.966
times the height of the parallelogram.

00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.364
Area is equal to base times height.

00:00:32.364 --> 00:00:34.628
So, what could we consider to be

00:00:34.628 --> 00:00:36.450
the base of this parallelogram?

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.654
Well, we could imagine it
to be one of these sides.

00:00:39.654 --> 00:00:41.309
So, we could go from here,

00:00:42.023 --> 00:00:43.592
and so, I could say...

00:00:43.592 --> 00:00:46.716
well, I could consider
this to be the base.

00:00:46.716 --> 00:00:48.650
So, what's the length of that base?

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.557
Well, we're just going in
the vertical direction.

00:00:51.557 --> 00:00:53.617
We go from "y" equals five,

00:00:53.617 --> 00:00:55.560
to "y" is equal to negative seven,

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.127
so this has length 12.

00:00:57.127 --> 00:01:00.518
We have five above the x-axis,
and seven below the x-axis,

00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:01.555
adding up to 12.

00:01:01.555 --> 00:01:02.441
Or, you could count it:

00:01:02.441 --> 00:01:04.661
One, two, three, four, five,

00:01:04.661 --> 00:01:08.569
six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12.

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:10.052
So, this is our base,

00:01:10.052 --> 00:01:12.824
and we could say that base is equal to 12.

00:01:12.824 --> 00:01:14.938
And, now, what could
we view as our height?

00:01:14.938 --> 00:01:19.927
Well, we could view this dimension,

00:01:19.927 --> 00:01:23.341
right over here, as our height.

00:01:23.341 --> 00:01:24.759
And, what is that going to be?

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:25.685
Well, you can see very clearly

00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:27.675
that the height is equal to four.

00:01:27.675 --> 00:01:29.059
And, it might be a
little counter-intuitive,

00:01:29.059 --> 00:01:30.374
'cause normally, when
you're talking about height,

00:01:30.374 --> 00:01:33.023
you're used to thinking
about how high something is,

00:01:33.023 --> 00:01:35.818
but you could imagine rotating this around

00:01:35.818 --> 00:01:39.110
so that the base is laying flat,

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.724
and then the height is the height,

00:01:40.724 --> 00:01:42.675
in the traditional sense of the word.

00:01:42.675 --> 00:01:45.849
But, we could say "h" is equal to four,

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:47.682
and now, it's pretty straightforward.

00:01:47.682 --> 00:01:52.064
Our area is going to be equal to 12,

00:01:52.064 --> 00:01:55.186
the length of our base times our height,

00:01:55.186 --> 00:01:56.091
times four,

00:01:56.661 --> 00:01:57.881
times four,

00:01:57.881 --> 00:02:00.352
which is clearly just 48.

00:02:00.352 --> 00:02:03.108
48, whatever, square,

00:02:03.108 --> 00:02:05.476
48 square units.
