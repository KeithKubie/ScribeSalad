00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.753
Let's have a look at how to do this. In this case here we were asked to fill in

00:00:03.753 --> 00:00:09.680
the ranges for x and y. Let's look at the picture, x moves this way starting at

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:15.714
0 and going up to the width minus 1. Y goes this way, also starting at 0 and

00:00:15.714 --> 00:00:22.180
going up to the height minus 1. That gives this loop for x and this loop for y.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.254
We were given a formula for the distance, and we can use that down here. Here

00:00:26.254 --> 00:00:33.334
it is, simply using center x, center y and x, y for the two points. Now if the

00:00:33.334 --> 00:00:37.303
distance is larger than the radius, then we should color the pixel black and

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:39.130
we're done.
