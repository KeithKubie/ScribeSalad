realize that the dinosaurs did not have
 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.460
realize that the dinosaurs did not have
a space program that's why there are no

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470
a space program that's why there are no
 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.920

dinosaurs in this room right now how

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930
dinosaurs in this room right now how
 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.510
dinosaurs in this room right now how
could there not any dinosaurs here

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520
could there not any dinosaurs here
 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.280
could there not any dinosaurs here
because they didn't have a space program

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290
because they didn't have a space program
 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.680
because they didn't have a space program
and that's why Elon Musk wants to create

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690
and that's why Elon Musk wants to create
 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.400
and that's why Elon Musk wants to create
a space faring civilization and then we

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410
a space faring civilization and then we
 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.920
a space faring civilization and then we
have Jeff Bezos of Amazon he has a
