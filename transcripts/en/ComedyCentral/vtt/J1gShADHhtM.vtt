00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:04.037 size:88% position:44%
 (dramatic orchestral music)

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.243
 - What if I told you
 a story about heart?

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:11.477 size:88% position:44%
 We all have a heart

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.647 align:start size:88% position:13%
 and that heart needs
 to be set free.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.116 size:84% position:42%
  Imagine a bakery.

00:00:17.616 --> 00:00:18.418
 A man.

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:21.254 size:88% position:44%
  He's an all American hero.

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:22.488
 Heisman Trophy winner,

00:00:22.521 --> 00:00:24.257 size:88% position:44%
 he fought in World War Two.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.358
 And in Korea.

00:00:26.225 --> 00:00:28.161
He was also in Vietnam.

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:30.797 align:start position:0%
 Not the war, just
 vacationing there one year.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.066 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Hardest working man
 you've ever met.

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:35.334
 Harder working than
 any of his employees.

00:00:35.367 --> 00:00:39.338 align:start position:0%
  Try as they may they just
  couldn't outwork him.

00:00:39.371 --> 00:00:41.574 align:start size:88% position:13%
  But some people
  don't have a heart

00:00:41.607 --> 00:00:45.145
 and sometimes those
 people are your son.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.681 align:start size:88% position:13%
 He was as foul
 mouthed as they come.

00:00:48.714 --> 00:00:50.383
 Where you from lady?

00:00:50.416 --> 00:00:54.120 align:start position:0%
  That's where all the sluts
  are from, am I right?

00:00:54.153 --> 00:00:57.123
My (beep) smelled like a (beep)
I wouldn't (beep) me either.

00:00:57.156 --> 00:00:59.125
Huh? (chuckles)

00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:01.527
Me no speaka English. (chuckles)

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.162
I hope you all get AIDS.

00:01:03.195 --> 00:01:04.029
 What, you too stupid?

00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:06.232
 What, you guys don't
 understand jokes?

00:01:06.265 --> 00:01:07.100 size:84% position:42%
  Go Trump.

00:01:08.801 --> 00:01:10.770 size:88% position:44%
 But like most pure geniuses

00:01:10.803 --> 00:01:13.139 align:start size:88% position:13%
he was also a
degenerate party animal.

00:01:13.172 --> 00:01:15.174 size:88% position:44%
  (snorting)

00:01:15.207 --> 00:01:17.410
 (rock music)

00:01:28.787 --> 00:01:31.357 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Then one day, he's
 wasted, flips his car.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.160
 (car crashing)

00:01:35.227 --> 00:01:38.231
 He survives, but his
 brain is damaged.

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:40.733 align:start position:0%
  The father, however,
  decides to still have him

00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:42.668
come work at the bakery.

00:01:42.701 --> 00:01:45.305
 (upbeat music)

00:01:54.847 --> 00:01:57.517 size:84% position:42%
  Then one day the father
  gets a call from a doctor

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.819
who explains to him that
they can return his son

00:01:59.852 --> 00:02:01.754
 to his previous mental state

00:02:01.787 --> 00:02:04.790
through the miracle of surgery.

00:02:04.823 --> 00:02:07.193
 However, in order to
 perform this surgery

00:02:07.226 --> 00:02:09.228 size:84% position:42%
  the father needs
  to sign off on it

00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:11.430 align:start size:88% position:13%
because the son can't
make decisions like that

00:02:11.463 --> 00:02:13.699
 in his current mental state.

00:02:13.732 --> 00:02:15.935
So the father now has to decide.

00:02:15.968 --> 00:02:18.738
Keep the son like he is, happy.

00:02:22.241 --> 00:02:24.577
 Or return him to who he was.

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:28.548 size:88% position:44%
  (chuckles)

00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:31.184 align:start size:88% position:13%
 What up, nimrods, I'm
 back, you miss me?

00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:33.186 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Yeah, I was a
 vegetable for a while

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:33.953
 you know what I mean?

00:02:33.986 --> 00:02:35.388 size:84% position:42%
  I was a cucumber.

00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:37.356 size:84% position:42%
  No, I'm kidding,
  I was a zucchini.

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:40.459
 - Oh, my God, oh, my God, boo!

00:02:40.492 --> 00:02:42.695 align:start position:0%
 - [Comedian] I was a squash,
 did I already say that?

00:02:42.728 --> 00:02:44.264
- Boo, you suck.

00:02:46.465 --> 00:02:50.369
- [Comedian] Because
once again he's a hero.

00:02:50.402 --> 00:02:53.940 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Yeah, that's a really
great movie idea.

00:02:53.973 --> 00:02:57.743 align:start position:0%
  So did you want a
  cappuccino or a macchiato?

00:02:57.776 --> 00:02:59.312
- Uh, tap water.
