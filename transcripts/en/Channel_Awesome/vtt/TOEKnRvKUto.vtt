[Nostalgia Critic theme plays]

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.320
[glass shattering]

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.180
[laughter]

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.540
NC: Black Nerd Stock! What's going on here?

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.560
BN: I'm finally doing it!

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.400
I'm making an authentic Ninja Turtles movie!

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.260
NC: What? How?

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.880
BN: I'm putting in everything that's been missing.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.660
Krang as one of the villains, his giant robotic body.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.380
A Technodrome with an incredibly pointless eye on top!

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.760
[crazy laughter]

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.740
Tasty, isn't it? Mmm yummy!

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.060
[banging]

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.140
NC: Well, if it isn't my old friend.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.780
Really? You're...you're playing Casey Jones?

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.540
AVGN: What? He's a whiny good-looking complainer with a clean haircut, right?

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.560
NC: No, that's not what Casey's like at all--!

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.060
BN: Beebop and Rocksteady instead of Tokka and Rahzar!

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.800
A black Baxter Stockman like from the original comics!

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.280
Oh, this is gonna be good.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.380
[angry]

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.740
NC: Help me out here, would ya?

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.860
Tamara: Oh, yeah. I'm totally invested.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.440
NC: Tamara?

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.420
You've been with us before, how come you 
seem so...disinterested this time around?

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.940
Tamara: Oh, I'm really interested.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.780
My miniskirt got like two inches shorter from panicking.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.140
BN: A Turtle Van that shoots manhole covers! 
They can sell it in stores!

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.040
Turtle gadgets! Rocket skateboards!

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.760
NC: Look, Black Nerd...I know you mean well. 
But I just get a feeling this is all gonna...

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.040
Backfire.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.580
AVGN: Yeah, this all seems a little...uh... 
Beebop: Hey guys!

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.180
What do you say we talk about our dicks and make fart jokes all day?

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.440
BEEBOP!

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.100
Misguided.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.100
NC: Where do you get the money to do this anyway?

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.480
BN: Oh, from him.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.820
Shredder?: Hi, guys!

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.580
AAH!

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.300
AVGN: Ah, you can't trust him.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.960
BN: Oh, come on. He's not making the film. He's just financing it.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.880
Michael Bay: Yeah, you won't even notice I'm here...

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.000
Oh, gosh, that's such a pretty movie.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.860
You mind if I touch it?
BN: - Sure, put your fingerprints all over it!

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.560
Critic and Nerd: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO...

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.460
Tamara (Disinterested): Noooooooo...
-OOOOOOOOOO

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.920
OOOOOOOOO!!

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.680
[electric explosion]

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.060
Nostalgia Critic: 
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.620
the follow-up to the Michael Bay produced hit from 2014.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:28.220
Angry Video Game Nerd: Everyone got excited for this movie because it was finally giving everything that the fans always wanted, I mean everything!

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.520
Black Nerd: Bebop and Rocksteady, Baxter Stockman, the Technodrome, the Turtle Van

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.460
and most notably, Krang, one of the biggest villains.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.820
How did everyone react to it?

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.140
AVGN, NC and BN: Ahh... eh...

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.060
AVGN: It sucked.
NC: A little bit.
BN: Mmhm.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.680
NC: Some things are amazing and a ton of fun to watch, but other things are..uh..

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.940
AVGN: It sucked. 
NC: -Yeah, we got it!

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.020
BN: So what did this movie get right and what did this movie get wrong?

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.600
Well, strap on your giant mechanical, nunchuck arms.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:56.380
NC: That's cool.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.420
BN: Well get to it.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.480
This is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles:
Out of the Shadows,

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.040
Not to be confused with the video game of the same name.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.500
NC: There's a video game of the same name?

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.540
BN: There is. 
NC: -Is that like Turtles 3: Turtles in Time,

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.520
but it wasn't called Turtles in Time, but the Super Nintendo was...?

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.900
[chatting indistinctly]

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.540
Nostalgia Critic (Frustrated):THIS IS THE MOVIE!!!

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:24.180
NC: It opens with New York looking unhealthily green...
AVGN: -They've been infected by a nuclear Shamrock Shake?

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.140
NC: -as the Turtles are seen jumping off the Chrysler building to...

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.220
Pick up a pizza.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.160
BN: Seems like a detour.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.000
Michelangelo: "Thanks, Kevin! See you next week!"

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.980
Black Nerd (Imitating Mikey): "When we'll find out more ways to destroy your creation!"

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.820
AVGN: The movie then literally spells out their names.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.660
Yeah, thanks, we would have forgotten if you didn't remind us.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.540
NC: We're not watching Game of Thrones, we can remember who these four are!

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.160
BN: But they were also nice enough to list their marketable character stereotype.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.660
BN: They go to a Knicks game, because if you like Ninja Turtles, you obviously also like Basketball.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.900
where it's revealed that Vern, played again by Will Arnett is given credit for defeating the shredder.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.780
AVGN: How the hell is anyone supposed to believe that?

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:11.100
Speakers: "But when danger struck the heart of our city. He single-handedly battled Shredder, locking him up behind bars."

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.060
[crowd cheers]

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.540
Malcolm: Hey, guys, just thought I'd let you know that I just single-handedly defeated Godzilla.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.140
So, if you'll excuse me. I'll be off to get the key to the city.

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.660
NC: Oh good for you Malcolm. 
AVGN: Yeah, I'll just blindly believe that.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.580
BN: Wait, how did you defeat him?

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.740
NC: You can't ask something like that!

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.420
AVGN: That's totally uncalled for.
NC: -I'm sorry, Malcolm. He doesn't get it.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.100
Malcolm: Yeah, take care of your friend...

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.220
NC [whispers]: What the hell's wrong with you?

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.220
AVGN: We all know who the real monster is.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:45.060
NC: The Turtles then shoot spitballs at him, because it's clearly more important than stopping crime

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.460
and they seem to get a direct hit.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.620
[imitating crow cawing]

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.080
BN: I think they're all having simultaneous strokes.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.300
[cawing continues]

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.740
[cawing]

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.800
NC: They get a call from April, played again by Megan Fox,

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.120
who's following a scientist named Baxter Stockman, played by Tyler Perry,

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.760
who she thinks is working for the Shredder.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.160
BN: Either that or Madea is undercover as Neil Degrasse Tyson.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.140
AVGN: Neil Degrasse Tyson, really?
BN: -Yeah, Neil Degrasse Tyson.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:24.160
NC: You're sure that Tyler Perry as Baxter Stockman 
doesn't look like anyone else you can think of...?

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.720
BN: Nope.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.040
[sighs] Fine! Tyler Perry as Baxter
Stockman kind of looks like me.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.640
NC: Really? I was just gonna say 
he looks like the original comic,

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.980
but now that you mention it, 
yeah, it does look exactly like him!

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.140
[laughs]

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.920
[laughter continues]

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:46.700
Haaa!

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.300
April O'Neil: "There's a big difference.
I'm a nerd not a geek.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.440
It's the difference between like Ted talks, and--" 
Stockman: "Comic Con! Yeah!" (laughs awkwardly)

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.740
NC: She starts downloading information off of his iPad, but it gets taken away before she can get all of it.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.560
April: "It has truly been an honor to meet you, and you were really one of the greatest minds of our generation."

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.140
NC: Huh, that's how most women get
out of a conversation with Michael Bay.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:11.620
BN: Speaking of which, insert our gratuitous sexy shot as April finds an emergency Schoolgirl uniform stand to disguise herself.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.860
NC: "Maybelline.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:23.040
For your random spot light appearing, pantyhose vanishing, Kleptomaniac tendencies.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.420
That'll be $94.25, bitch."

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.920
April: "Look, everybody! I got a cowboy!"

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:29.760
"CHEESE!"

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:35.920
AVGN: Wow. I didn't know such a lame excuse 
could get somebody into skimpy clothing.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.000
NC: Oh, Tamara!

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.500
Black Nerd is holding some information for us

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:45.360
and the only way he'll spill it is if somebody dresses up in a Harley Quinn uniform. Accommodate us.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:46.760
Tamara: No.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:48.500
NC: But Michael bay said you would.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.560
Tamara: No. 
BN: -First season Harley Quinn?

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.940
Tamara: Okay, I'm not Megan Fox!

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.500
You can't just easily replace me
If I don't do what you want.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:55.000
NC: No?

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.620
Tamara Quinn: Of course not! Now which of these baseball bats looks better?

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.620
[laughter]

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.080
BN: That's our Tamara!

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.240
[audience laugh track sound]

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:11.260
AVGN: We then see the Shredder being hauled to jail and-- wait a minute.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.220
Who's this guy?

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.880
I know we didn't really see the
Shredder's face in the first film

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.880
But even from that shadowy outline,
we know this isn't the same guy.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.880
Even his reveal is nothing!

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:32.840
Last time, it was a big mystery what he looked like 
and now it's just "Oh, hey. I'm Shredder. No biggie."

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:35.320
He's unmasked the majority of the film!

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.300
That would be like if Michael Myers
was walking around without a mask.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.940
NC: Yeah, it's like saying this Chris 
O' Donnell look-alike is Casey Jones.

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:42.960
"Hey, Jones!"

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.960
"They're all yours."

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.860
ALL 3: WHAT THE HELL??

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:53.140
BN: Casey Jones is a pissed-off vigilante.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.460
He hates the justice system 
because he thinks it's broken,

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:58.520
resulting in a short fuse badass 
who doesn't play by the rules.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.180
Think Rambo meets Jason.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.540
What's this guy's story?

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.880
Casey (Whining): "That's Officer Jones and I'm 
gonna be a detective someday!"

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:05.600
NC: Close.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.440
Just take the exact opposite of
everything he was and that's him.

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:13.740
NC: Look the guy playing him, Stephen Amell, is a 
good actor. He's proven that time and time again.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:18.120
But in this movie, they're just not
giving us who Casey Jones is.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.840
Casey: "What up, big daddy lawbreaker!"

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.000
NC: "Ready to forget how awesome I was in Arrow?"

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.240
Casey (Boasting): "You got 32 counts of first-degree murder!

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:29.120
Hot damn! Take it from someone who has his 
own problems with anger-management issues--."

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:33.540
AVGN: Ooh! That must mean he's a badass. 
He has anger management issues!

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:36.940
Casey: "I myself am a hockey guy, it's like bone-crushing on ice."

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:41.500
NC: This movie's overcompensation is like that 
kid who says "my mommy thinks I'm tough!"

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:42.800
Baxter: "Here we go!"

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.380
BN: So, Baxter Stockman, and the Foot
Clan ambush the truck to break him out.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.800
BN: Actually, why do they even need the Shredder? It looks like they're doing pretty damn good without him.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:59.200
NC: Yeah, I think it's like losing Ted Healy 
from the Three Stooges. It's not a big loss.

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.340
"Nunchucks Giganticus!"

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:03.880
[metallic banging]

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.220
NC (Excited): Okay, that was awesome!

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.040
[metallic clang]

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.000
BN (Dissapointed): And they're gone!

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.500
AVGN (Dissapointed): And the coolest thing only lasts a few seconds.

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:14.040
NC: Get used to that.
AVGN: -Get used to life.

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:17.100
Casey (Standing there with a taser): "Shredder!"

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.800
NC: "If that is your real name!"

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:19.860
[yelling]

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:20.620
Baxter: "Initiate."

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.640
BN: But Baxter uses a teleportation 
device to beam Shredder away,

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:29.520
resulting in him somehow meeting up with everybody's favorite alien brain, Krang!

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:33.820
Krang: "You and your buddy Dr. Stockman found something of mine.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.680
The teleportation device,"

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:42.260
NC: And now it's time to play why is this awesome, but not as awesome as we thought it'd be.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:45.820
AVGN: Krang looks pretty good, even with the Modern-day updates,

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:51.800
but for some reason they give his body this cluttered mechanical head instead of the traditional bald head from the cartoons.

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:57.660
I wouldn't mind so much except in the trailers, they clearly did give him the bald head, so why change it?

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.620
BN: No, no, that's not the reason.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:06.120
The real reason is because Krang barely gets an introduction before he jumps into immediately throwing 
a ton of plot at us.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.140
Like a TON!

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.780
Krang: "That device is part of a
machine called the ARC capacitor."

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:15.540
"It broke apart into three pieces.
Collect the other two pieces."

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:18.660
"I launched the Arc capacitor to Earth's dimension.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:22.380
It will open a portal through which 
I could bring the Technodrome!"

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:28.780
BN: We barely have a chance to take in how awesome it is to see Krang on the big screen because everything in this movie is so quickly rushed!

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:33.640
NC: No, that's not the reason either. 
The big issue is his voice.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.840
That's Brad Garrett. Who's usually a pretty good choice, but he comes across as really...

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:40.780
random in this.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:45.920
Krang: "Oh, I'm sorry! Did I get a little tentacle mucus in your eyes?" (Yeah like no kidding sherlock)

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:50.900
NC: The inflections, the pitch, the attitude, 
none of it seems to have any direction.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.740
Anyone with the weird distinct voice can do it.

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:58.420
I said anyone with a weird distinct voice can do it.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:00.420
[sighs]

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:01.680
I'll be right back.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:05.820
EpicVoiceGuy: That's a good question, um, I guess
my favorite one is Pacific Rim.

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:12.200
They forget about the whole drifting things they had one part that was just separate from all the rest--aaaah!

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.300
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.120
NC: Go!

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:20.820
Alright, alright.

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:22.420
[sighs]

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.260
EpicVoiceGuy: Wait, what am I doing?

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:25.280
[sighs]

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.420
NC: I'm trying to show that the voice of Krang is very 
random and anyone with the distinct voice can do it

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.420
so do some distinct voices!

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:35.660
[sighs]

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.020
EVG: Like what?

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:42.240
NC: Anything! You're good at this, come up with any distinct voice you can think of!

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.700
These back and forth shots are very difficult to edit!

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.620
EVG: How about a little Walken?

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.820
EVG [Christopher Walken Voice]: "Shredder, shame on you."

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:55.820
"I see more than just an expensive bubble.
I want to give you more power.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.120
Ooby doo! I want to be like youhoo-hoo.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.580
And fuck the cops! Fuck em!"

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:04.340
But Sam Elliott has different plans.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:09.600
[Sam Elliot Voice]: I want to use the technodrome, made by Dodge Ram to steal all the good sarsaparilla.

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:11.740
I'm talking about the Kraang here."

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:15.700
[Black Nerd's Voice]: "With the help of Dr. Blaxter Stockman. That's heavy."

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.260
Using the plutonium god from the Libyans,

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:22.500
we're gonna make this town disappear faster than the Back to the Future animated series.

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:24.680
NC: Beautiful! Nicely done!

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.880
EVG: Wait, that's it? You literally 
dragged me here just for this?

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.100
NC: Well, I can't really think of anything
else to do with your talents.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:32.620
BN: Wait a second!

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:36.980
What if we turned him into a mutation of all 
the nostalgic Saturday morning cartoons?

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:37.740
EVG: Really?

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.160
AVGN: Oh, like the comedy of the Ninja Turtles!

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.620
EVG [Michelangelo Voice]:"Cowabunga, dudes!"

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:42.980
BN: And the strength of Lion-O!

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:44.940
EVG: [Lion-O Voice]: "Thundercats! HOOO!"

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:46.600
AVGN: The Brilliance of Batman!

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.840
EVG: [Batman Voice]:"I am the night."

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.880
NC: My God, this could be amazing!

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:51.040
Go, Jon Bailey!

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.620
Create the greatest combination of Saturday morning cartoons ever!

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:55.620
EVG: Oh my God. I'm so excited!

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.700
BN: Ah, I can't wait to see what he comes up with.

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:00.800
AVGN: He's a good kid. 
BN: -Yeah

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.020
NC: What makes things even stranger is how willing Shredder is

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:07.720
just to go along with this weird Brain's domination plan.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.740
Literally in seconds, he agrees with it.

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:14.420
Krang: "We can bring the people of your planet to their knees."

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.040
Shredder (Without second thought): "I'm interested."

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.180
NC: No, no, no. The correct answer is "Who are you??"

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:21.260
AVGN: "What are you?"
BN: "Where the hell is this?"

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:22.660
NC: "What? What??"

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.340
BN: We then cut to Laura Linney as the police chief.

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:29.360
Because a woman in a pantsuit will
balance out a woman in a short skirt.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.940
NC: Hey, it worked great for black people in Transformers 2.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:36.460
AVGN: Her only job is to roll her 
eyes and say "Nope. Wrong. Uh-uh."

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.280
Laura: "You proved to be an authority on nothing!"

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.400
"Don't take help from someone 
who's responsible for losing them."

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.120
"And where did you recover this?"

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.960
"Leave this manhunt to the professionals."

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:47.820
NC: When will people learn that the doubting Police Chief in movies is always right? (Never) :(

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:53.260
AVGN: She throws Jones off the case because, big surprise, they don't believe his story about giant turtles.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:54.680
Laura: "Thanks for your statement, Jones."

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:55.820
Casey: "That's officer Jones!

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:59.620
[Whining] Look, I can help you catch these guys. I'm not crazy. I know these streets better than anyone."

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:05.100
[whining]

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.980
NC: But it's okay because he decides to solve the case himself.

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:13.740
And you better watch out, because
when he goes rogue, he roughs up...

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:15.360
people's glasses!

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.220
[glass shattering and yelling]

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:19.300
AVGN: Ooh, he's really off the rails!

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:22.460
In the original film, he's beaten the shit out of bad guys,

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:24.820
but here. He's throwing CDS.

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:26.400
See these nuts?

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:27.500
Bartender: "Are you out of your mind?"

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:28.240
Casey: "Gettin' there."

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:29.120
[glass shattering]

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.020
BN: Does this fall more under interrogating or temper tantrums?

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:33.620
"I love this song."

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:34.280
[glass breaking]

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:36.980
BN: But hey, it was a Vanilla Ice CD that he threw,

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:39.320
so, that's a reference. Yeah, that's a point.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.260
Bartender: "I have a GPS. You find them with that."

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:45.540
NC: So Shredder finds the two inmates who helped him escape called Bebop and Rocksteady

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:48.800
and uses them as test subjects 
for one of Krang's weapons.

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:52.140
BN: Now, in most incarnations, they
mutated by combining people with animals

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:54.040
using the same ooze that made the turtles.

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.840
Simple. Makes a lot of sense.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.780
So what's the complicated reasoning here?

00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:02.520
Baxter Stockman: "Inside every human, there's a dormant gene which ties us to our animal ancestors.

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:07.640
It's as if that purple ooze has returned them to their rightful place in the animal Kingdom." (???)

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:11.660
AVGN: What the hell are you talking about?

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.420
Animal ancest-what?!

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:19.080
What was wrong with just put the ooze on 
them and combine them with other animals?!

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:23.620
BN: Does this mean other people have animal 
ancestors, like Snoop Dogg was actually a dog?

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.600
NC: Taylor Lautner was actually a llama?

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.660
AVGN: Wallace Shawn was actually a seal?

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.880
BN: Hey Dennis Hopper. What are you descended from?

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:32.520
Dennis as Bowser from SMB Movie: "Tyrannosaurus Rex. The Lizard King."

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:35.460
NC: The story behind the rock band
is making more sense than you!

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.660
Bebop: "You're a rhinoceros!"

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:40.760
Rocksteady: "And you're uh...I don't know what you are!"

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:44.520
NC: "Hey, Timon! 
Time to make our obligatory cock joke!"

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:48.220
BN: Pumbaa, not in front of the kids.

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:49.760
Both: "My man!"

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:53.120
BN: Yeah, have fun sending dick 
pics to the cast of the jungle book.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.120
AVGN: Well, it goes along great with their fart jokes.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.200
Rocksteady: "Well, I got a big bang for you."
[loudly farts]

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:00.040
Rocksteady: [laughs]
Bebop: "Man, that is awful!"

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:03.040
NC: How's the cartoon for kids 
coming across as more adult?

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:05.960
AVGN: April sees what happened and tries to escape,

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:09.720
but Casey's there to save her wearing 
his trademark hockey mask.

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.080
And this is the only time you'll see him wear it.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.480
Did you enjoy it?
 NC: No?

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:15.420
BN: Too bad.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:20.080
NC: Casey's introduced to the turtles while they're trying to figure out the best way to track Bebop and Rocksteady,

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.560
But he doesn't want anything to do with it.

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:23.760
Casey [Whining]: "I was doing just fine!"

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:25.720
"If you want to get work done, 
don't spend time at the zoo."

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:26.640
"If I'm gonna find them--."

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:27.580
"You know, it's like they say..."

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:33.400
[incessant whining]

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:36.060
BN: "Arrow's Wednesday on CW."

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:40.360
BN: But Donatello makes an amazing, 
if not totally nonsensical discovery.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:45.820
If Krang's ooze can turn people into animals, 
perhaps it can turn the turtles into humans.

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:48.980
AVGN: Maybe if they combine it with that 
Super Nintendo controller on his arm,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
We can get a really good turtles game.

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.880
Leo: "We don't need that kind of change."

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:57.280
NC: But Leo says "no" without consulting the others which eventually makes its way to Raph and Mikey.

00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:00.420
Raphael: "You should consult with us before 
you decide to do something like that!"

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:03.740
Leo: "There's only one vote that counts in this family. Mine."

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:09.220
BN: Well, at least they keep the most
important of turtle traditions.

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:11.520
NC: Leo is always the worst leader.

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.040
Leonardo: "Master Splinter will be very upset--."

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.880
"Stop this vigilante nonsense."

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.560

"I'm better than you..."

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:29.420
BN: Is there an ooze that just transforms you into less of an asshat?

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:33.940
AVGN: Raph and Mikey want to break into police headquarters to get more of the ooze,

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:36.640
So they call on Vern to help them sneak in.

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:38.760
Vern: "Guys like you and me, we're kind of the same."
-"Right."

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.700
You know, we bring a lot of 
joy and hope into people's lives."

NC: "I will erase years of Bojack 
in one single performance!"

April: "We need to go. Bring that key to the city with you."

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.740
BN: Michael Bay gets tired of 
making the military look like idiots,

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:55.420
so he turns to making the police look like 
idiots as our heroes easily sneak past them

00:18:55.580 --> 00:19:00.200
with Megan fox saying"'Cowabunga" and not the Turtles.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.320
April: "Cowabunga."

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.140
BN: Win.

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:10.100
AVGN: Wow gotta love that incredible
look of shock and horror on April's face

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:13.100
Did she find out they're in trouble or try to hold back a fart?

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:17.280
BN: In fact a lot of Megan Fox's
performances underplayed

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:21.720
