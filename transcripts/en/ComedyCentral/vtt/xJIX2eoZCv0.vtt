00:00:02.903 --> 00:00:04.137
That's weird.

00:00:04.238 --> 00:00:08.008
I don't get people that think
climate change isn't real.

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:10.811
Had a hurricane here in the
Northeast to the magnitude

00:00:10.911 --> 00:00:12.479
that it's never
supposed to happen.

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:15.148
But I really don't get people
that think the first thing I

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:18.185
mention has anything to
do with the [beep] second.

00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:22.022
Like, that's the craziest
thing I've ever heard of.

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:23.056
It's not pollutants.

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:24.892
It's dudes kissing
dudes and God's mad.

00:00:24.992 --> 00:00:26.293
What don't you get?

00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:28.295
[laughter]

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.899
First off, if God is causing
these natural disasters

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:34.067
because gay-- like guys are
hooking up with guys and girls

00:00:34.168 --> 00:00:35.369
are hooking up with
girls-- he's either

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:37.704
drunk or has terrible aim.

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:40.073
When has a hurricane
or a tornado ever

00:00:40.174 --> 00:00:43.143
hit San Francisco ever?

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:44.044
Or West Hollywood?

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:44.845
Is he just drunk?

00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:46.113
Like, stupid gays.

00:00:46.213 --> 00:00:48.382
Oh, [beep] sorry, Nebraska.

00:00:48.482 --> 00:00:49.316
My bad.

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:52.085
My bad again.

00:00:52.186 --> 00:00:54.121
Wiped out cows and
crops yet again.

00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:55.022
Missed all the gays.

00:00:58.458 --> 00:01:03.163
And the thing is, look, if
we knew that gay activity,

00:01:03.263 --> 00:01:04.965
specifically sexual
gay activity,

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:07.534
could cause natural
disasters, don't you

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:09.269
think we'd harness
that militarily?

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.271
[laughter]

00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:14.174
We're America, OK?

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:18.512
We spend all our money on
[beep] guns to run the world.

00:01:18.612 --> 00:01:20.547
If we could just
have dudes hook up

00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:24.751
and cause tornadoes and
shit, that would be amazing.

00:01:24.852 --> 00:01:28.689
Some Taliban commander
coming out of his fortress.

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:30.691
What's that in the distance?

00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:32.659
Handsome men
shoulder to shoulder

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.562
as far as the eye can see.

00:01:35.662 --> 00:01:36.930
They're not in fatigues.

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:38.765
They're dressed stylishly
and they're holding hands.

00:01:39.967 --> 00:01:43.103
Is that ABBA I hear on the wind?

00:01:43.203 --> 00:01:45.606
The music of ABBA and Erasure?

00:01:45.706 --> 00:01:47.608
And then just a--
just a projected

00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:49.576
amplified voice of a Sergeant.

00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:51.812
It's like, left turn!

00:01:51.912 --> 00:01:52.613
Dicks out!

00:01:52.713 --> 00:01:54.014
[laughter]

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:54.915
And [beep].

00:01:55.015 --> 00:01:56.250
And [beep].

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.919
And lightning bolts take out
the entire Taliban compound.

00:01:59.019 --> 00:02:01.455
Tornadoes wiping out
America's enemies.

00:02:01.555 --> 00:02:03.423
[applause]

00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:06.426
What's that coming from the sky?

00:02:06.527 --> 00:02:10.731
Lesbian paratroopers scissoring
as they float to the ground.

00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:13.667
Monsoon rains wiping
out all of Al Qaeda.

00:02:17.671 --> 00:02:19.840
We would give them their own
division of the military.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:20.941
You kidding me?

00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:24.645
The Army, Navy, Air
Force, Marines and gays.

00:02:24.745 --> 00:02:26.513
Let them design
their own uniforms.

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:28.815
[beep] they'd look good, man.

00:02:28.916 --> 00:02:29.216
Shit.
