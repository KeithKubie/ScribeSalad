00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:09.500
In Black Mirror robotic dogs open doors, but
in real life MICROSCOPIC robots could explore

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.560
your digestive system -- and I don’t know
which creeps me out more.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.929
Let’s introduce, microscale magnetic tumbling
robots, OR microTUMs.

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:23.310
These 4 to 800 micron long tiny bots are designed
to deliver a specific drug to a specific place

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.310
in your body.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.230
Imagine taking a pill filled with these instead
of just filled with powdered chemicals.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.220
See, when you take a normal pill the medication
just sort of dissipates all over the place

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.650
hopefully hitting the prescribed target, but
some things are harder to find.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.530
Like, a 1 centimeter peptic ulcer in a 10
meter gastrointestinal tract.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.860
It becomes a needle in the haystack.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.580
And these robots are designed to navigate
your gastrointestinal haystack.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.380
The human body is vastly complex and the robots
will be facing tough resistance towards their

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.100
destination, so mobility is key.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.920
As you can see there’s isn't much room for
a battery or wires in this tiny robot.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.100
Which is fine, because they’re actually
powered from the outside… using magnetic

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.100
fields.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.479
The idea is, once you’ve ingested these
lil guys, their two magnetic ends, which are

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.740
embedded with neodymium-iron-boron (NbFeB)
particles, are paired with an constantly rotating

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.200
magnetic field, the microTUMs can then be
set in their course to tumble over the bumps

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.950
and trenches inside your body.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.990
The tumbling motion of these microTUMs plays
an important role because the tumbling allows

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.840
the bot to be in constant contact with the
surface.The robots are versalite, malleable,

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.750
and in most cases have autonomous motion capabilities.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.969
But it’s not easy designing things this
small.

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:48.530
Engineers have to understand forces that only
exist on a micron scale -- like van der Waals

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.359
forces -- which are too complicated to explain
right now, but are an attraction between molecules

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:58.539
that could, along with electrostatic forces,
stop these bots in their tracks.

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:04.139
The microTUM researchers were able to model
those forces in their lab and create a tumbling

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:07.079
solution which keeps them rolling.

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.769
Once they roll their way to the problem, the
bots release the drug they’re carrying and

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:12.599
hopefully you’re all-better.

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.360
But scientists at Caltech are thinking about
a slightly different medical micro-solution.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.670
They’re working on “smart pills”.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.160
Which are microns in length as well, but instead
of just tumbling to deliver drugs, these tiny

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.150
microchips serve as “wardens of our body”
flowing through to monitor our health from

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.310
the inside.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.220
Things like pH, temperature, pressure, and
sugar concentrations could all be relayed

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.660
back to your doctor to help in diagnosis.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.870
No matter which of these find their way to
the medical market, the future looks tiny.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:03:01.959
Everyday we’re getting closer to making
swallowing tiny robots a reality.

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:09.439
Which is great, but also a bit unnerving thinking
about microbots traveling around inside of

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:15.250
me… kind of preferring the the robot dog
advancements now.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.400
Hey there macropeople, like learning about
all things science?

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.031
Go ahead and subscribe and while you’re
here, check out this interview with a researcher

00:03:21.031 --> 00:03:24.950
who’s trying to make one shot give you all
the vaccines in you could ever need.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.319
Fun fact: So how long is 400 microns exactly?

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.200
Well it’s about one-third the size of an
average grain of sand.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.200
Dang.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.203
Thanks for watching.
