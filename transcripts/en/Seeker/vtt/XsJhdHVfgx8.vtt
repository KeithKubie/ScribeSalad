00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:05.590
There’s a number that holds some of the
deepest secrets in the universe. It’s responsible

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.970
for how chemical reactions happen, how stars
burn, and is so key to our existence that

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:17.260
if it were off by just a few percentage points — you, me, all of this, might not even be here.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.930
And somehow, it comes out to 1/137.
It’s a number that’s baffled scientists

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.660
for nearly a century, and according to physicist Richard Feynman,

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.420
is “one of the biggest damn mysteries in physics.”

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:38.440
1/137, otherwise known as the fine structure constant, or alpha,

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.140
is a fundamental constant of nature.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.440
These numbers are the laws of the cosmos, governing everything

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.340
from the force of gravity to the
behavior of quantum particles. And to understand

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.980
how we get alpha, we need an expert who’s been studying it for decades.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.740
My name Is John Webb, I'm a professor of astrophysics at the University of New South Wales in Sydney,

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.740
and we're gonna be talking about varying constants of nature.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.660
The fine-structure constant is formed from a ratio

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.420
involving the electron charge, the speed of light, and Planck's constant.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.800
That is the quantity that physicists use to describe how

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.680
strong the electromagnetic force &nbsp;is. The
electromagnetic force is one of the known

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.410
four forces of nature. Very important, the
force involved in keeping the structure of

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.300
atoms the way that they are.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.260
Because alpha dictates the strength of the electromagnetic force,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.020
it's not tied to the units we typically
use to measure things like weight or distance.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:41.820
It comes straight from nature itself, and
that’s why alpha is dimensionless. A dimensionless

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.520
constant has no units associated with it,
no meters, no seconds, nothing like that.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.340
It's a pure number.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.940
Alpha is a mystery, because its value, 1/137 comes to us with no explanation

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.980
as why it has that value. It’s a numerical coincidence, with huge implications for us.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:05.420
If you change alpha, you change the way that
atoms are held together. If it had been a

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.270
few percent different in the early universe,
hydrogen, for example, might not have been

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.550
the most abundant element, but helium might
have been. Stars would have evolved very differently,

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.440
the evolution of the chemical elements would
have been very different to what it was, and

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.600
indeed human beings, rocky planets, might
not even exist. For a small change in alpha.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.180
And this notion of whether the constants of nature are as constant as we think, has

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.569
kept many physicists up late at night. The
first mention of it in the scientific literature

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:43.190
was in 1874 by Lord Kelvin, and a friend of his Peter Tait. There were speculations

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.880
by Eddington and Hermann Weyl.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.880
Paul Dirac wrote a paper speculating and physicist Wolfgang Pauli

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.260
famously quipped, “When I die, my first
question to the Devil will be:

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.660
What is the meaning of the fine structure constant?”

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.720
Ironically, he passed away in Room 137 in a hospital in Zurich.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.040
And to this day, no one’s figured it out.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.200
I first started getting interested in alpha in the 1990s actually.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.800
At that time the Keck telescope was collecting some amazingly good data.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.400
By using observations from Keck
and the VLT telescope in Chile, Webb and his team

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.710
published papers that found variations in
alpha, depending on where you are in the universe,

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.180
and that’s been the subject of a spirited
debate.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.260
We've been working on this for quite a while, searching

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:39.000
to check whether there's any time or space variability of the fine-structure constant,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.490
and so we do that by looking at
quasars all over the sky. They're very bright

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.120
and they're quite small, actually.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.620
They emit a huge amount of light from a very small volume of space.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.860
It is thought that they are essentially the centers of galaxies, black holes powered

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.500
by accretion from material nearby.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.080
Whilst they're fascinating objects as far as we're concerned, really,

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.330
they're just beacons of light shining along a huge path length through

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:13.280
the universe. Whilst that light is on the
way, between the quasar and us, inevitably

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.720
it gets absorbed by things that intersect
the sight line.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.040
When light passes through the halo of an early galaxy,

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.480
it's as if it takes a snapshot of physics at that time.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:35.240
Gaseous halos of early galaxies cause absorption dips in the spectrum of the quasar.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.180
We see all sorts of elements in these absorption dips: iron, magnesium,

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.180
nickel, chromium, zinc, aluminum.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.160
They use instruments called spectrographs to analyze the light coming from the quasars to our telescopes.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.260
You can split the light up from the quasar

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.409
into its spectrum, and look at
all of the different wavelengths that fall

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:57.700
onto your detector.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.539
We know what the elements are. We know how much gas is present.

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:05.979
You can measure it very accurately and we can measure the physical conditions in the gas

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:11.599
clouds that are giving rise to this absorption.
So you can think of it like a barcode on a

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:16.580
supermarket product, you see the black lines,
and if you change alpha, they all change their

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:23.110
positions. If the fine structure constant
were different at that time, then the amount

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.550
of energy required to get an electron to change
its orbit from one level to another, would

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.789
be slightly different. We have a tentative
signal that there is some kind of something

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:37.400
strange going on, a spatial variation. Because
when we look in one direction in the universe,

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.320
we see alpha&nbsp;a little bit smaller.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.140
And if you're looking in the opposite direction, it tends to be a little bit bigger.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:49.980
Of course, that's been met with several criticisms, quite correctly. That's exactly how a science should proceed.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:55.919
This is not a confirmed result. It was statistically
kind of fairly significant, but the trouble

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:00.840
is the data are very complicated. The instruments are very complicated.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.980
The calibration is very complicated.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:08.300
As Carl Sagan once said, extraordinary
claims require extraordinary evidence —especially

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:11.020
when you're challenging the law of the cosmos.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.960
So the European Southern Observatory

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.940
is going to put a brand new instrument called ESPRESSO to the test.

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.840
It’s a souped up spectrograph handled by lead project scientist, Paolo Molaro,

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.920
to hopefully nail this mystery.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:35.340
Espresso is a spectrograph that is under vacuum and determines stabilities at the level of one milliKelvin.

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.260
The first thing that we had to make

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:45.180
is a cadre tray of optical elements to bring the light from the telescopes

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:53.050
to the lab. And this tray is composed of  prisms, lenses, mirrors,

00:06:53.050 --> 00:07:00.550
which exactly break the light from the telescope to the lab. When the light of the source is injected

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:09.409
in fibers and the fibers feed the spectrograph,
which is contained in a vessel under vacuum

00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:15.740
and there are different enclosures that make it terminally stable.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.960
This is the different ball game now.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.840
We will get very, very accurate data.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:28.240
We had the first run and we are now in the middle of that processing.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:34.960
We have to verify everything. So the first
results will be about in one year.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:41.580
And if ESPRESSO finds that the fine structure constant varies, it would be a very big deal.

00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:46.199
It'd open the door to theories that predict multiple dimensions in space time and potentially,

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:48.900
a grand unified theory of physics.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.710
But whether this number signifies some larger metaphysical

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:56.740
truth remains to be seen. There are kind of
two schools of thought. One is that actually,

00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:04.309
yes, we will one day when our knowledge advances,
be able to explain why the fundamental constants,

00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:10.870
including the dimensionless ones, have the
values that they do. That's my belief too.

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:17.330
I think we will, one day. But there are other
alternative ways of looking at this. It is

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:25.220
interesting that the constants that we do
have seem to be finely tuned for our existence.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:30.279
It leads to this idea of the anthropic principle,
and the anthropic principle says basically

00:08:30.279 --> 00:08:37.759
this, we shouldn't be surprised to see that
the constants of nature are finely tuned for

00:08:37.759 --> 00:08:42.269
our existence, because if they were not we
would not be here, sitting around talking

00:08:42.269 --> 00:08:47.100
about it. And maybe that's from this point of view, all you need.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:53.350
In fact, they're finely tuned by the
hand of God, that's one point of view that

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:58.960
many people probably do hold. There's another
point of view, and that is, well, actually

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.639
there's an infinite number of universes, and
each one of those universes has a different

00:09:02.639 --> 00:09:07.680
set of physical laws and we just happen to
be in one that we're able to, um, talk about.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.780
I think Stephen Hawking liked that idea.

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.120
So there's multiple ideas, there's a lot of thoughts, and

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.020
we're probably still at the early days of our understanding.
