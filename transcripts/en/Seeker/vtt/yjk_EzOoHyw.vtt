00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.240
It’s cold, it’s stressful, it’s loud,
it’s dark, and only three humans have ever

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.170
been there… where am I thinking of?

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.170
Ew.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.480
Get your mind out of the gutter.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.400
Hey there deep divers, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.170
3.5 billion passengers flew on airplanes in
2015, according to the International Civil

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.920
Aviation Organization.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.980
Many of those passengers flew at or higher
than 36,000 feet or 11 kilometers above sea

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:29.980
level.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.579
Yep, equivalent to half the world’s population
went plus 11 last year…

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:36.510
how many went minus 11?

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.790
How many people EVER have gone 11 kilometers
under the ocean?

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:41.790
Three.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:42.790
Ever.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.960
Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh in 1960, and
James Cameron in 2012.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.530
3.5 billion up, three down.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.780
That’s pretty uneven.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.340
We know quite a lot about the world from 11
kilometers (and above), in fact, we know there

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.810
are oceans on other planets, but what do we
know much about the Mariana Trench -- the

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.920
deepest known place on Earth?

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.200
The Mariana Trench was discovered by a British
Royal Naval vessel, the HMS Challenger during

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.080
what is widely considered the first oceanographic
expedition in history.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.630
The ship covered about 110,000 kilometers
over the 1,000 day voyage from 1872 to ‘76,

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:20.690
and they published their findings in a 29-thousand-five-hundred-page,
50-volume report -- ahem -- 23 years later...

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.660
It took a while to put it all together.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.430
Anyway, they took depth measurements (called
soundings) throughout their trip around the

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.600
globe, discovering the mid-Atlantic ridge
(a mountain range in the middle of the Atlantic)

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.100
as well as the deepest sounding recorded to
that date, southeast of Japan…

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.900
Their measurement read 8,184 meters (26,850
ft)!

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.490
Over 8 kilometers (5mi)!

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.730
If you plopped it down, Everest’s tip would
peek above the waves, but they were waaay

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:46.730
off.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:51.370
Measurements taken in the decades since that
first expedition kept pushing the Mariana

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:57.520
lower -- until in 2010 the United States Center
for Coastal &amp; Ocean Mapping measured Mariana’s

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.130
deepest point -- called Challenger deep -- at
about 10,994 meters (36,070 ft)!

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.760
This would leave Everest more than 1.6 kilometers
(1mi) below the surface of the Pacific.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.870
This 2550-kilometer-long trench, named for
the nearby Mariana Islands, was formed by

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.250
subduction, meaning one of the tectonic plates
that hold the continents of our planet is

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.520
dipping beneath the neighboring plate.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.440
This chasm sits under so much water, the pressure
is 1,000 times greater than at sea level with

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.240
temperatures near freezing.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.300
Plus, light only penetrates a few hundred
meters into seawater.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.010
Everything below 1,000 is in the aphotic zone
-- no photons.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.520
So, at nearly 11 kilometers it’s darker
and colder than you can imagine.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.660
And yet, life abounds…

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.500
Down there we’ve found amphipods -- which
are related to crustaceans, ranging in size

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.190
from thumb-sized to 30 centimeters (1ft)...
sea cucumbers -- echinoderms (like starfish

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.980
or sea urchins), and microorganisms like foraminifera
-- sort of like giant amoebas… they’re

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.500
shelled, protists (a Kingdom of life we rarely
talk about on DNews).

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:07.120
In fact, a Japanese robotic expedition in
2005 found over 400 species of protists.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.200
According to a super-great SciAm article on
Challenger Deep, these xenophyophores use

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.870
sand found on the seafloor to construct shells
and protect themselves.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.440
In shallower seas they use calcium, but at
that depth, the pressure is just too great.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.200
Of course, if bacteria can survive on Mars,
then it stands to reason they’re on the

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.730
bottom of the ocean too.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.030
Researchers found Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria,
Geobacillus, and others.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.040
Each distinct from their surface-dwelling
cousins, in that they’d evolved to survive

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.190
under the incredible pressure at the bottom
of the ocean.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.620
According to a 2013 paper in Nature Geoscience,
there may be 10 million microbes per cubic

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.190
centimeter in this seafloor sediment!

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.260
Not dissimilar to population densities of
regular topsoil on the surface.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.330
It’s weird though, I mean, without light
or heat, life at this depth is so… alien!

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.580
For example, what do these life-forms eat
(other than each other)?

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.650
We need to visit more… not just for our
curiosity.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.250
In 2012, film director and explorer James
Cameron descended at the “amazingly fast”

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:12.440
150m per minute, and became the first human
in decades to lay eyes on Challenger deep.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.650
He took samples and recorded the whole thing
on video.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.770
On the surface, scientists of all flavors
were drooling in jealousy and excitement for

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.799
what would be recovered.

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.580
Understanding how life can survive in such
extreme environments doesn’t just help us

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.550
understand the ocean, but LIFE in general!

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.300
If we want to look for life on other planets
and moons like under the ice sheets of Europa

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.450
or Enceladus… we’ll need to understand
what we’re looking for.

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.720
Science begets science begets curiosity begets
exploration.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.730
I love it.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.080
What do you think?

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.280
Should we explore the ocean?

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.280
Or space?

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.680
Want to know more about the oceans orbiting
Saturn and Jupiter?

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.270
