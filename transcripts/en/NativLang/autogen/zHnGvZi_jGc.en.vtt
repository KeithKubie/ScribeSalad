00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:12.820
This is clearly a bus, right?

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.129
No, no, not even close!

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.660
This is obviously a Greek people-carrier.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:26.539
And if you want to get around Greece in one,
better bust out your electronic calculator

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.699
and look up the roadology in a quest machine.

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.640
But if that doesn't have you all like, “huh?

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.100
what?!”, then stick around and let's take
a look at the weird, the crazy and sometimes

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:57.680
hilarious words that old tongues have for
talking about new technologies.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.050
Throughout India it's incredibly common for
technical terms to come from Sanskrit, not

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.050
English.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.130
And in Sanskrit, you can learn all about the
principles of things: the principles of chemistry,

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.579
the principles of prosperity, and even the
principles of pleasure.

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:13.780
Uh, hello!?

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.520
Where was that one in my university's course
catalogue?

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.990
Never one to give into the barbarians, China
has crafted some nifty tech terms.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.740
Take the two characters in mobile phone - they
stand for "hand machine".

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.360
Clever enough, but check out this word.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:38.500
Sure, it sounds like hacker, but it cleverly
slides past copyright infringement: “Hey,

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.670
we didn't steal it!

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.950
That's just our word for dark visitor!”

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.630
If you come down with a fever while speaking
Swahili in Kenya, you'll be a "person-sick"

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.560
when you visit the doctor . Let's hope they
don't diagnose you with problem of kidney,

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.040
because then they'll probably have to shred
or split you!

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.950
Turkey has made an art of ditching foreign
words and creating new Turkish ones since

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.299
the end of the Ottoman days.

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.599
(Before you get too cozy, we're talking about
the heyday of this kind of Ottoman, not this

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.100
kind of Ottoman.)

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.989
For anyone out there whose two life goals
happen to be getting to space and competing

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:19.049
in the Turkish Language Olympiad (yes, that's
a thing!), here's one stone for your two birds

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:22.720
- practice Turkish in a space vehicle.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.069
Totally makes sense, right?

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.290
You'll then join the elite group of spacemen.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.290
Hooray!

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.189
But you can't be totally averse to sharing
the experience with other languages, because

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:37.099
you're going to need things like rockets and
computer algorithms to get there.

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:40.980
Speaking of computers, in France and Spain
it's an ordinator.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.709
Or is that OOORDINATORRR.

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:49.090
I bet you wish your comp had a name that powerful.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.889
Nearby Italy on the other hand has no problem
just using a computer.

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:57.879
But not everyone in Italy is so happy to take
on new words.

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:03.919
The Vatican has good Latin terms for everything
from audiovisual fables to nocturnal taverns

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:08.839
to - my personal favorite - super spacious
airships.

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:12.419
Boom, there it is, a Latin jumbo jet.

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:16.579
You know, I bet some Roman emperors wish they'd
had one of those.

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:22.349
We're looking at you, Caligula... sheesh,
just what history needed, a Roman Soul Plane.

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:26.860
If Latin jumbo-jets can't convince you that
dead languages don't stay dead, then check

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.930
out Icelandic, where old resurrected words
dig themselves right out of their zombie Viking

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.480
graves.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:42.519
Yeah, it's cool that the old word for line
came in handy again, but nothing beats booting

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.620
up your Icelandic number-prophetess.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.529
Way to go, Iceland, you're such a make-believe
land.

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:54.230
As if we didn't already have proof of that
in the form of Björk and Sígur Rós.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.620
Across the pond in the Incan Andes you can
take a class on the world order in the native

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:59.620
tongue.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.969
In fact, since pacha already means time or
space, why not dig into the relations of world

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:10.930
things, sorry, you and this guy probably know
that as the theory of relativity.

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.599
Got your fill of physics?

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:13.729
Don't leave the New World yet.

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:19.269
First, drive north in your Blackfoot "starts
to run without apparent cause".

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.260
If that's not fast enough, the Koyukon of
Alaska might suggest an "it rises of its own

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.260
accord".

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.930
If all else fails, it's about attitude.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.590
If you don't have a term for it, just make
the word look native.

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.620
Hawaii has this down pat.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.590
Hawaiianizing words and phrases like ainokea
gives island imports an authentic look and

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:39.590
feel.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.990
That gets us a kamepiula, assuming you don't
want to go full native and call it an electric

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.990
brain.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.370
That's so cool.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.680
Getting terms to sound and look more native
even if they're totally not is everyday business

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.180
in Japanese, where the locals can "box in"
foreign examples by writing them in a totally

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.680
different script - so hair dryers are hair
dryers and roller coasters are roller coasters,

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.710
even though they don't look like it at first.

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:13.289
Yeah, see that, that, that, that and that?

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:14.590
They're all from English.

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:20.000
Oh, hey, there's one more piece of technology
I wanted to share with you guys.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.050
It’s called the subscribe button.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:29.449
And if you just *whack*, you and I can stick
around for more technologeawsomeness in the

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:30.879
future.

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:34.449
I promise not to do the robot ever again.

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:35.719
Just click it, go ahead!
