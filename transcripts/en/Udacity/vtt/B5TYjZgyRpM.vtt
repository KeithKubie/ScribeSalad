00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.980
Vista, by virtue of its simplicity, by making

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.010
one of the problems go away, namely, the power

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:10.020
failure, the implementation is very simple. 700 lines of

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.490
code in Vista as opposed to more than 10,000

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.300
k lines of code in the original LRVM implementation.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.750
Why? Because there are no redo logs. All the

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.970
changes that we're making to virtual memory for persistent

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.200
data structure directly get in to the data segments.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.220
So no redo logs. Correspondingly, there is no truncation

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.620
code, and check pointing and recovery code is significantly

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.600
simplified, and there is no group commit optimizations. The

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.070
upshot of all of these simplifications that comes from

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.540
one simple trick and that is to make a

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.200
portion of the DRam persistent. And implement the file

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.270
cache with that persistent portion of DRAM can get

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.730
rid of redo logs and get rid of truncation

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.840
code and Vista has the simplicity of

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.820
LRVM but it is also performance efficient. I

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.760
encourage you to browse through the performance

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.430
results that are reported in the paper on

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.900
Rio Vista which I have assigned for

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.880
your reading. To see how Vista performs compared

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.600
to LRVM. In particular, Vista performs three

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.430
orders of magnitude better than the original LRVM

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.730
because of the simplicity and the fact that there is no disk IO. That

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:27.200
is the biggest improvement in making Vista perform really well compared to LRVM.
