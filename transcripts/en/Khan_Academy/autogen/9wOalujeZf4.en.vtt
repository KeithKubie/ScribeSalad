00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.720
 . 

00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.360
 Perhaps you know that any equation is linear 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:10.300
 You can write y = mx + b 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.630
 Where m is the line inclination 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.590
 The same tendency we were dealing with 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:15.580
 In previous presentations 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.300
 Height / After Line 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.090
 Or it's a regression line 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:20.920
 And b is the y intersection 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.890
 Intersection y 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.630
 I think it's easy to verify that b is 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:27.310
 Intersection y 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.350
 The verification method is offset x = 0 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.590
 If you get x = 0 - remember that x = 0, this is 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.580
 I mean where the intersection with y axis 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.630
 If x = 0, this equation becomes y = 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.650
 m × 0 + b 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.430
 m × 0 = 0 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.520
 I will not pay attention to the value of m 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.620
 Then y will equal b 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.075
 If point 0, b will be on this line 

00:00:58.075 --> 00:01:00.680
 0, b 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.510
 The line will intersect with the y axis at the point 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.540
 y = b 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.060
 We'll see that using actual numbers in 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.420
 Upcoming offers 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.080
 So prove to you that M is the inclination, let 's 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.310
 Try with some setup 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.840
 We know that point 0, b falls on the line 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.465
 What happens when x = 1? 

00:01:18.465 --> 00:01:21.700
 When x = 1 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.450
 We will get y = m × 1 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.210
 Or it is equal to m + b 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:34.200
 We also know that point 1, m + b 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.290
 Also located on line 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.490
 Right? 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.900
 This is the value of y 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.770
 What is the tendency between that point and that point? 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.280
 Let's take this as an end point, if we have m + b 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:52.030
 Change in y, m + b - b / change in x 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:59.770
 I / 1 - 0 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.740
 This is the change in y / variance in x 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.660
 We use two points 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.480
 That's the end point 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.120
 That is the starting point 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.100
 If you simplify it, b - b = 0 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.840
 1 - 0 = 1 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.500
 We get m / 1, which equals m 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.510
 I hope you are satisfied now and I did not bother you 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.410
 Select it by using all of these 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:18.410
 Variables here 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.140
 But it will give us the inclination of this doubt 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.580
 The intersection will be y 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.360
 Now, what I want to do in this exercise is to look at 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.890
 These graphs are then used in finding 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:33.860
 The equation 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.550
 We'll look at this, we'll find the inclination 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.650
 We find the y intersection and then we know the equation 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:48.440
 Let's start with Line A. What is A Mile? 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.670
 Let's start with a random point 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.620
 Let's start from here 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.430
 We want to get even numbers 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.070
 If we move to 1, 2, 3 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.550
 If delta x = 3 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.820
 is not it? 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:07.550
 1, 2, 3 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.640
 Delta y - I do this because I want to get 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.430
 The number is even here - Delta y = - We go 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.330
 Down by 2-- = -2 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.790
 For A, the change in y for the change in x 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.400
 When the change in x = 3, the change in y = -2 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.860
 If the tilt is 2 / 3- 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.790
 When we move to the top by 3, we will move down by 2 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.920
 Or if we move to the top by 1, we will move down by 2/3 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.790
 We can not see this here exactly, but you undoubtedly see it 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.800
 When you move to the top by 3 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.430
 This is the tendency 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.380
 We have done half of this 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.280
 Now we find the intersection y 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.580
 This m 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:50.810
 Now what the value of b 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.340
 Any intersection y 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.120
 Well, which intersects this with y axis? 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.260
 Well, we've already said that the tilt is 2/3 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.250
 If this point y = 2 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.610
 When we move to the top by 1, it can 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.880
 We move down by 2/3 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.000
 If this point should be 1 1/3 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.370
 Or in another way, we can say it is 4/3 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.920
 That point is y = 4/3 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:16.660
 Here 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:17.560
 More than a little 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.269
 1 1/3 approx 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.029
 It can be said that b = 4/3 

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:27.300
 We will know that the equation is y = m 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.850
 2/3, x + b, ie + 4/3 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.590
 This is equation A 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.600
 Let us find equation B 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.860
 I hope we do not deal with 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.510
 Many fractions are here 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:40.360
 Equation B 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.420
 Let us first find its inclination. Let's start when 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.830
 A certain point 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.510
 We can start at this point 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:49.650
 Let me here 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:50.380
 B 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.030
 Equation B 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.100
 When delta x = - call me type 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.960
 In this way, delta x 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.040
 If delta x is 1 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.640
 When we move 1 to the right, what will happen 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.480
 For y delta? 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.270
 We move to the top by 3 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.710
 Delta x 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:08.670
 Delta y 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.140
 The change in y is 3 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.710
 If delta y / delta x, when we go to the right 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.940
 The change in x is 1 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.830
 The change in y is positive 3 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.760
 If inclination = 3 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.410
 What is y intersection? 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.550
 Well, when x = 0, y = 1 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.160
 If b = 1 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.210
 This was somewhat easier 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:39.430
 The equation here is y = 3x + 1 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.280
 Let's do the last line 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:49.100
 Line C, let's find the intersection y first. As you see 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.820
 The intersection of y - when x = 0, the y = 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.040
 2 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.380
 If b = -2 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.300
 What is the tendency? 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:03.220
 m = change in y / change in x 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.880
 Let's start at the intersection of y 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.630
 If we go to the right by 1, 2, 3, 4 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.570
 If the change in x = 4 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.380
 What is the change in y? 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.945
 The change in y is -2 

00:06:16.945 --> 00:06:19.630
 The change in y is -2 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.780
 If the change in y is -2 when the change in x = 4 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.390
 If mileage = 1/2, 2,4 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:31.870
 The equation here is y = 1 / 2x, that is 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.750
 Inclination 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.560
 We're done 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.480
 Now let's move on to the other direction 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.850
 Let 's look at some equations of lines and know that this 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:44.900
 The slope and this intersection y - so m 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.340
 And that b - let's represent them graphically 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.320
 Let's start with this line first 

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.030
 I have already begun to cover it with orange 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:51.350
 The intersection of y is 5 

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.800
 When x = 0, y = 5 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.240
 You can check it out in the equation 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.920
 When x = 0, y = 1, 2, 3 

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.590
 4, 5 

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.890
 This is the y intersection and the inclination is 2 

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:08.330
 This means that when I move 1 by x, I will move up by 2 

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:09.770
 Towards y 

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.490
 If you move to 1 towards x, I will move up by 2 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:12.990
 Towards y 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.050
 If you move to 1 towards x, I will move up by 2 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:17.320
 Towards y 

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.550
 If it turns back to 1 towards x, it will move down by 2 

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.830
 Towards y 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:24.160
 If you turn back to 1 in the x direction, you will move down by 2 

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:24.750
 Towards y 

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:25.970
 I will continue to do so 

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:29.130
 If this line looks like - I can not draw lines in style 

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:31.060
 Very well done, but it will be the best I can do 

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.240
 It will look like this 

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.100
 I will continue more and more 

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.140
 This is the first line 

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.720
 I can keep going down that way 

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.420
 Let's draw this line 

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:47.200
 y = -0.2x + 7 

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:53.910
 Let me type this, y = -0.2x + 7 

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:55.450
 It's always easy to think about fractions 

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:57.420
 If 0.2 equals 1/5 

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:03.500
 We can write y = -1 / 5x + 7 

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.000
 We know that the intersection of y is 7 

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.270
 That is, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:11.100
 This is the intersection of y when x = 0 

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:15.240
 This shows that for every 5 we move to the right 

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:18.120
 We will move down by 1 

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:21.330
 We can consider it 1 / 5- 

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:25.590
 Delta y / delta x = -1.5 

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:28.430
 For every 5 we move to the right, we will move 1 down 

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:29.370
 Per 5 if 

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:31.550
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:32.650
 Move 5 to the right 

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:35.169
 This means that we have to move down by 1 

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:36.309
 Move 5 to the right 

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:38.690
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:40.549
 We have to move 1 down 

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:44.740
 If we return, that is if we move by 5 back - instead of 

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:47.260
 This, if I consider it 1/5 

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.450
 These are clearly in equal numbers 

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:52.060
 If we return 5 - this - 5 

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.500
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.805
 So we will move 1 to the top 

00:08:56.805 --> 00:09:00.050
 If we return 5-1, 2, 3, 4 

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:01.830
 5 - We will move to the top by 1 

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:04.110
 If the line looks like this 

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:07.000
 Just get out the points 

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.020
 I think you absorbed the idea 

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.170
 I just have to get those points out 

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:11.170
 I can not draw it a little straight 

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:13.840
 Now let's draw this, y = -x 

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.480
 y = -x 

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.800
 Where is the phrase b? 

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:18.940
 I do not see any words for b 

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:22.490
 You remember that we said that y = mx + b 

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:23.670
 Where b? 

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:24.780
 Well, b = 0 

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:26.770
 You can consider it 

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:28.290
 Here is b = 0 

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:31.710
 When x = 0, y = 0 

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:35.080
 This is the intersection of y, here on the origin point 

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.490
 Then tilt - another time we'll see a negative signal 

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:40.710
 You can consider it 1x + 0- 

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.200
 If the inclination is -1 

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.570
 When we move to the right by 1, when the change in x is 1 

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:47.690
 The change in y is -1 

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:52.320
 When we move upwards by 1 on x, we will move down by 1 on y 

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.580
 Or if you move down 1 by x, it will move up by 1 

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.660
 y, where x and y have opposite signals 

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:58.850
 They move in opposite directions 

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:03.955
 If the line looks like this 

00:10:03.955 --> 00:10:06.550
 You can imagine he divides 

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:08.240
 Second and fourth quarters 

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.980
 Now I will solve another issue 

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.160
 Let's solve this 

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.830
 y = 3.75 

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:19.610
 Perhaps you are saying now, we will look to y 

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:21.630
 = mx + b 

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:22.940
 Any phrase x? 

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:24.650
 It does not exist 

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:27.980
 Well, really here, the equation can be rewritten to become y 

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:33.240
 = 0x + 3.75 

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.120
 Now it has become logical 

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.500
 The tilt is 0 

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:39.020
 It does not matter how much x is changed, where y does not change 

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:42.930
 Delta y / delta x = 0 

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:45.770
 I do not care about the amount of change in x 

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:48.220
 Where the intersection of y is 3.75 

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:51.870
 If 1, 2, 3.75 are located here 

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:52.710
 You have to approach them 

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:54.990
 3 3/4 

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:57.620
 Whatever the change in x, y will not change, where y 

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.570
 It will always be 3.75 

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:03.200
 The line will be horizontally on 

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:07.450
 y = 3.75 

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:10.600
 Anyway, I hope you found this useful 

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:10.866
 .
