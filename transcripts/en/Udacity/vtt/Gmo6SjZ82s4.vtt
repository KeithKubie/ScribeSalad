00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
As long as we're doing thought experiments,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
let's do a quiz where our experimenter has access to control the laws of physics.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Let's say she chooses to double the strength of gravity.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
This object is now getting pulled to the center of the earth

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
with twice as much force as it was before.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
My question is if gravity were doubled, would our experimenter have to throw the apple

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
at a different speed if she wanted it to follow this circular orbit?

00:00:24.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Remember the point of these is just to get you thinking, so don't worry if you don't know the answer just yet.
