TAKAKO AIKAWA: So my
name is Takako Aikawa.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.550
I'm a senior
lecturer in Japanese.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.910
As the leader of the
Japanese language program,

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.910
I am shaping the direction
or future direction

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.420
of the Japanese language
program, and at the same time,

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.170
improving the existing
language curriculum.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.610
So the high-level overview of
the Japanese language program

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.870
at MIT is, so we
have three tiers--

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.890
beginning, intermediate,
and advanced courses.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.550
And each layer aims to
develop four language skills--

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.530
reading, writing,
speaking, and listening.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.490
And our main focus,
however, is to improve

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.630
so-called communicative
skills, be able to communicate

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.670
with native speakers.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.880
My first encounter
with language teaching

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.580
was when I was a
graduate student,

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.920
I applied for a
teaching assistantship

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.110
for Japanese teaching.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.770
I originally was trained
as a theoretical linguist,

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.160
so I didn't know anything
about language teaching.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.340
But when I first
taught Japanese,

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.550
I found a great gem
in language teaching.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.460
And since then, I'm very
passionate about language

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.810
teaching.
