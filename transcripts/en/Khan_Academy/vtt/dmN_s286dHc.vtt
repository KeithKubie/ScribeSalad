00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.860
We're on problem 151.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.940
If x and y are positive,
is the ratio of x to y

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.190
greater than 3?

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.430
And they're telling us that
x and y are positive.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.180
Fair enough.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.040
Statement one.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.210
x is 2 more than 3 times y.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.830
So x is equal to 3y plus 2.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.770
Let's rewrite the original
question because I think it's

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:34.950
going to look a lot like this.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.570
If we multiply y times both
sides of the equation-- and we

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.270
don't have to change the
inequality because they told

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.470
us that y is positive.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.750
They're both positive.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.830
So if you multiply both sides
of the equation times y, you

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.600
get x is greater than 3y.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.960
This is the same question
as this.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.870
Well, if we look at statement
number one, clearly x is

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.060
greater than 3y.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.700
Because x is 2 more than 3y
based on statement number one.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.880
So statement number
one is sufficient

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.190
to answer this question.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.730
x is definitely greater
than 3y.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.360
x actually equals 3y plus 2.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.860
This plus 2 tells you that
x is that much greater.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.790
2 greater.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.430
Second statement.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:21.520
The ratio of 2x to 3y
is greater than 2.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.580
Let's just do some algebraic
manipulation.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.520
3y, once again, we know
that's positive.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.750
So when we multiply both sides
of the equation by it, we

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.360
don't have to switch the sign.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:36.010
So you get 2x is equal to 6y.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.990
Now we can divide
both sides by 2.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.270
And you get-- oh, sorry,
why did I put equals?

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.170
It should be greater than.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.240
Divide both sides by 2 and you
get x is greater than 3y.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.610
So this statement and this
statement are the same thing,

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.770
so 2 alone is also sufficient.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.990
So either statement alone is
sufficient to answer this or

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.240
this question.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.680
152.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.470
OK, if arc PQ-- OK, let me
see if I can draw this.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.270
So they've drawn a semicircle.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.740
So let me draw a circle.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.800
That's a circle, and I can
make it a semicircle by

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.955
drawing a line from
there to there.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.920
That's about as good
as I can do.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.175
And they have it connecting
to some point.

00:02:26.175 --> 00:02:28.850
Let me see if I could do this.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.710
Looks like that.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.260
And then it looks like that.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.220
And then they actually have
drawn an altitude

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.275
coming down like that.

00:02:38.275 --> 00:02:41.840
And I think I've done
all my line drawing.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.080
And then, let's see, they
labeled this P.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.950
They labeled this Q.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.970
They labeled this R.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.000
And this is 2.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.540
And they say that this distance
right here is a.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.470
This distance right here.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.020
And then they say that this
distance right here is b.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.900
Fair enough.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.110
So they say if arc PQR-- so
that's that arc right there--

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.410
is a semicircle, what is the
length of diameter PR?

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.120
So they essentially want to know
what a plus b is, right?

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.810
That's PR.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.240
So that's their question.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.840
So immediately-- well let's just
look at their statements.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.260
What did they give us?

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.800
Statement one, they tell us
that a is equal to 4.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.080
So from knowing that a is equal
to 4, if we can figure

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.535
out what b is, then we would
know what a plus b is and we

00:03:34.535 --> 00:03:35.600
would be done.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.150
Well, let's see if
we can do that.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.410
Statement two is b
is equal to 1.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.320
So if we know what b is, and
then we can figure out a from

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.480
it, then we know what
a plus b is.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.970
So actually, I think if either
of these is sufficient, the

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.020
other one probably is.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.240
Because if statement one is
sufficient-- if knowing a we

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.640
can figure out b, then probably
knowing b we could

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.230
figure out a.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.220
But let's see if that holds.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.990
So one thing that immediately
should pop out of your head,

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.700
although I don't know if it
will-- and this pops out of my

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.320
head, really, from going
to math competitions

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.630
when I was a kid.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.420
But if you have a triangle
inscribed in a semicircle,

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.410
that triangle-- and one of its
sides is a diameter, right?

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:16.910
And that's the case
with this one.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.540
Because we know it's a
semicircle, so we know that

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.730
this is the diameter--
then that

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.120
triangle is a right triangle.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.370
This is a right triangle.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:26.920
Even the way they drew it, it
kind of looks like that.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.320
But you that's something
you should know.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.610
Even if this triangle was drawn
like that, it's always

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.780
going to be a right triangle.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.150
And I'll maybe do another
YouTube video proving that.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.510
But that's just a good thing
to know for the gmat.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.950
So let's see if we could use
that information and the

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.550
Pythagorean theorem to come
up with a formula that

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.340
relates a and b.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:51.040
So if we look at just
this triangle right

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.570
there, we know what?

00:04:53.570 --> 00:05:00.920
We know that a squared plus 4 is
equal to-- let's call this

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:06.730
side c squared-- is equal
to c squared.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:07.880
Fair enough.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.670
If we look at this smaller
triangle right here, we know

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:19.050
that b squared plus 4 is equal
to-- let's call this d

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.500
squared, that's the hypotenuse
of the smaller triangle-- is

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.570
equal to d squared.

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.340
Now, if we look at the larger
triangle, which we also know

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.790
is a right triangle, now c
squared and d squared are the

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.930
non-hypotenuse sides, and a plus
b is a hypotenuse side.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:42.180
So we know that c squared plus
d squared is equal to this

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:48.520
entire side squared, which
is a plus b squared.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.160
Well, we know what c squared
and d squared are.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.100
We can substitute that.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.840
So c squared is a squared plus
4-- and I'll switch colors

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.530
just to avoid the monotnony.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.660
So c squared is a
squared plus 4.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.690
And d squared is b
squared plus 4.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.370
And all of that's equal
to a plus b squared.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.050
Let's just multiply that
out because I think

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:15.210
we can do some canceling.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:22.000
So we get a squared plus
2ab plus b squared.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.560
OK.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.250
So, we could subtract a squared
from both sides.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.310
a squared, a squared.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.600
Subtract b squared
from both sides.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.710
b squared and b squared.

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.760
And this simplifies
out quite nicely.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:36.020
Let's see.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.625
4 plus 4 is 8, is
equal to 2ab.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:48.900
Divide both sides by 2, and
you get ab is equal to 4.

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.660
So all of this crazy
information, that this is

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.600
inscribed in the semicircle and
this is a, this is b, all

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.320
of that reduces down to
ab is equal to 4.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.080
So now we know.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.580
If we know a, if a is 4,
then we know that b has

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.420
to be equal to 1.

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.000
And then we can figure
out what a plus b is.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:08.510
It's 5.

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.560
So statement one alone
is sufficient.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.200
And similarly, if we know
what b is, we know

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.810
that a has to be 4.

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.360
And so a plus b is equal to 5.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.230
So that was actually
less hairy than I

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:20.300
thought going into it.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.970
Next problem.

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:24.410
And this really is
the home stretch.

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:28.390
153.

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:34.970
Does the integer k have a factor
p such that 1 is less

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:36.540
than p is less than k.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.540
OK, so they're essentially
saying, is k prime?

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.180
This is another way of saying
is k-- or you could

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.280
say, is k not prime?

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.730
Or k is composite.

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:52.890
I think that's the
word for it.

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:53.860
A non-prime number.

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.590
So that's all they're asking.

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:59.400
Does k have some other factor
other than 1 and itself.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.310
So let's see, statement
number one.

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:04.330
k is greater than 4 factorial.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:07.780
Well, 4 factorial is 4 times
3 times 2 times 1.

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:08.770
So that's 12 times 2.

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:09.650
That's 24.

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:13.040
So this boils down to k
is greater than 24.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.430
So I can give you both prime
and non-prime numbers

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:17.800
greater than 24.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:21.430
29 is prime.

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:24.460
30 is not prime.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:30.230
So statement one, at least by
itself, is pretty useless.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.110
k can be greater than 24 and
be prime or not prime.

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:35.400
Statement two.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.140
This looks interesting.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:41.340
13 factorial-- which is a large
number, so it's hard to

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:48.490
multiply it out-- plus 2 is less
than or equal to k, which

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:57.220
is less than or equal to
13 factorial plus 13.

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:01.700
So, essentially, what we need
to prove, somehow, is that

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:06.690
every number between this
and this is not prime.

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:09.400
And let's think about
how we can do it.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.660
Well, let's take the initial
example of 13

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.810
factorial plus 2.

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:20.550
So 13 factorial, just so you
know, is 13 times 12, times

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:24.750
11-- you keep going-- times
3 times 2 times 1.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:27.640
That's 13 factorial.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:31.030
So 13 factorial is definitely
divisible by 2.

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:33.160
So we could rewrite
13 factorial.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:41.010
We could write that as-- 13
factorial divided by 2

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:44.180
times 2 plus 2.

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.670
I just rewrote 13 factorial
plus 2.

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:48.580
And I want you to see that this
is the same thing, right?

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:50.800
I just divided by 2 and
multiplied by 2.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.870
And you'll see in a second
why I did that.

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:55.000
And this is a tricky problem.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.840
When I looked at this at first,
which I actually did

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:02.080
glance at before the video,
because-- I don't know if this

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.740
is something I would have gotten
right if I was under

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:04.650
time pressure on the gmat.

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:07.470
But when I thought about it a
little bit more it made sense.

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:11.540
So if I divide by 2 and times 2,
I could-- and this is going

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:12.520
to be an integer.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.670
Because we know that 13
factorial is divisible by 2.

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:17.570
2 is actually one
of its factors.

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:20.655
So as long as you understand
where I got-- you can divide

00:10:20.655 --> 00:10:24.590
anything by 2 and multiply by 2
and not change it So this is

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:28.170
the same thing as this.

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:36.060
And then if we factor the 2 out,
this becomes 2 times 13

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:42.470
factorial over 2 plus 1.

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:43.870
I just factored the 2 out.

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:45.180
This isn't a fraction.

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:48.830
That's just a line I did just to
not make it look too messy.

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:54.530
So what we show is that 13
factorial plus 2 is definitely

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:57.430
divisible by 2.

00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:59.450
Whatever that number is, it's
definitely divisible by 2.

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:00.500
And how do I know that?

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.800
Because this is just another
way of writing 13 factorial

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.070
divided by 2.

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:06.420
I'm sorry, this is another way--
let me write this down--

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:09.660
this is the same thing as
13 factorial plus 2.

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:11.350
It's just another way
of writing it.

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:14.650
I took 13 factorial divided by
2 and multiplying by 2, and

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:16.410
then taking out the 2.

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:19.640
And the reason why I know that
2 is divisible into this is

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.400
because I know that this
is an integer.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.280
We know that 13 factorial is
divided by 2 because 2 is one

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.570
of the things that
goes into it.

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:27.110
And so this is an integer.

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:27.900
You add 1.

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:28.970
So this is an integer.

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:31.060
And so you're multiplying
2 times some integer.

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.690
So this has to be
divisible by 2.

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:36.990
So 13 factorial plus 2
is divisible by 2.

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:40.460
Now let's just extend
that generally.

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:43.930
13 factorial plus x.

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:48.010
Let's prove that as long as x
is less than or equal to 13

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:51.100
that this is divisible by x.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:52.980
So we can do the same trick.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:56.950
You could say this is equal to
13 factorial divided by x,

00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:00.160
times x plus x.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:05.050
That's equal to-- you can factor
the x out-- x times 13

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:09.500
factorial over x plus 1.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:12.010
And how do we know that this
number, which is the same

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:14.060
thing as this number, how
do we know that this is

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:15.710
divisible by x?

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:17.050
Well, just a little thought
experiment.

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:27.780
We know as long as x is greater
than or equal to 1 and

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:30.270
less than or equal to 13,
and x is an integer.

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:32.330
As long as x is an integer
that's greater than or equal

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:36.610
to 1 and less than or equal to
13, it is one of the factors

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:38.170
of 13 factorial.

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:40.470
13 factorial is 13 times
12 times 11.

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:42.380
It's all of those numbers
multiplied together.

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:46.150
So we know that as long as x is
less than or equal to 13,

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:49.570
we know that this right here,
this is an integer.

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:51.510
If this is an integer,
then the integer plus

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:52.990
1 is also an integer.

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:56.836
So 13 factorial plus x
can be rewritten as

00:12:56.836 --> 00:12:59.930
x times some integer.

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:02.160
I'll call it I.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.680
But the bottom line is, the
reason why I wanted to do

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:09.760
that, it shows you that every
number between 13 factorial

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:17.850
plus 2 and 13 factorial plus
13 is actually divisible by

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:20.940
whatever number you're adding
to the factorial.

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:24.370
So since it's divisible by those
numbers, the numbers

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:26.120
cannot be prime.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.200
So hopefully-- I've actually
run way over time-- but

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.440
hopefully I've shown you that
that information alone,

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:37.540
statement two alone, is
sufficient to show that k is

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:41.500
not prime or that k does
have a factor p that's

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.000
between 1 and k.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.660
Anyway, I hope didn't
confuse you.

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:46.600
I think that was one of the
hardest problems we've done,

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.730
so don't feel bad if you found
that a little daunting.

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:50.830
See you in the next video.
