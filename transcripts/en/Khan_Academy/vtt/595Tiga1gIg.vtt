00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:01.790
Welcome back.

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.700
In the last video, I at the
end of the video, like I

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.700
always do in the attempt to
confuse you, I told you that

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.060
if I had two vectors-- And let
me just make up some new ones,

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.520
so I can draw them visually
in a second or two.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.920
Let's call the first vector a.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:15.910
Let me do a different color.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.490
This toothpaste color is
getting monotonous.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.880
Let me do something that
looks relaxing.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.910
Let's call a first vector a and,
I don't know, let's make

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.500
it interesting, let me say it's
minus 3 times the unit

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.520
vector i plus 2 times
the unit vector j.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.570
And then I have vector b.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:48.120
And that is equal to, 2i, so two
times the unit vector i.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.100
Plus, 4 times the
unit vector j.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.550
In the last video I said, well,
the whole reason why

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.680
this unit vector notation is
even -- Well, one of the

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.860
reasons, we'll see that there
many reasons why it's useful.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.390
One of the really cool things
about it is, before when we

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.170
added vectors, we would put them
head to tails, and then

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.960
draw it visually, and then
we had this new vector.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.980
And we really had no way
of expressing it

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.130
without drawing it.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.850
But when we write things as
multiples of the unit vectors.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.020
We don't have to draw it.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.290
And it's actually very
easy to add vectors.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.890
And how do we do it?

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.050
We just add the x components,
and we add the y components.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.100
So we said that these two
vectors, a plus b, these

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.320
little weird arrows on top,
that's just saying that those

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.790
are vectors.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.040
That's equals.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.640
So it's minus 3, plus 2i, and
I'm going to arbitrarily

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.150
switch colors, because it's
getting monotonous.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.450
Plus 2 plus 4j.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.680
We just added the x
components, or the

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.800
multiples of i.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.440
And we added the y components,
or just the multiples of j.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.180
Because i was the unit vector in
the x direction, and j was

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.050
the unit vector in
the y direction.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.560
And we get, what's
minus 3 plus 2?

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.600
That's minus 1.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.190
We get minus 1i.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.510
That could just be minus i.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.720
But I'll write the 1 because
we're just getting warmed up

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.419
with unit vectors.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:15.410
So minus 1i plus 6j.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.990
And when I did that, you might
say, well, Sal, I can't just

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.790
take your word for it.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.910
Because you seem
not someone who

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.090
should be believed blindly.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.200
So I think that's a valid
opinion to have. So I will

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.330
show you that this works, by
adding the vectors visually.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.410
So let's draw it.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.640
And I think this will give you
a little better sense of unit

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.910
vectors generally.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.635
Let me draw the axes.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.820
So that's my y-axis.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.070
Let me draw my x-axis.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.400
I have to make sure have enough
space to draw the unit

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.890
vectors that we've drawn,
or to draw the

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.140
vectors that we've drawn.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.990
Just to show that the axes go
on forever, I have to draw

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.270
that arrow.

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:13.433
All right, so let's say
this is 1, 2, 3.

00:03:13.433 --> 00:03:21.140
This is 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:30.360
And I draw 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.110
I think we should be able
to now add them.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.020
I didn't have to waste all
this space down here.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.200
So let's just first draw the
vectors, minus 3i plus 2j.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:46.070
So minus 3i, just this right
here, is going to be a vector

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.700
that looks something
like this.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.600
So it's just minus 3 times
the x vector, so

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.320
it'll go to the left.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.780
Because i is 1 in the
positive direction.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.180
If we put a negative there,
it flips it over.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.690
Let me use a different color.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:05.940
So this is minus 3i,
and then plus 2j.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.560
So plus 2j looks like this.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.300
If we were to add those two
vectors visually, we can put

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.170
them head to tails.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.750
And the way we can do that, we
can either shift this vector

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.730
up like this, and
draw it up here.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.910
Or we could shift this vector,
and put its tail

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:22.810
its vector's head.

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.010
But either way, let's
shift this one up.

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.950
So if we shifted up like that.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.160
Remember, we're just doing the
head to tails, visual addition

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.480
method of vectors.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.340
So I just put this tail
to this head.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.260
And what do we get?

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.400
So vector a will look like this,
and I'm going to do it

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.360
in the same color as vector a
because I have a feeling that

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.710
this diagram might
get complicated.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.150
Well, I wanted to use
the line tool.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.700
OK, so this is vector a.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.740
That's what vector
a looks like.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:56.880
And so we worked backwards.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.260
I gave you the x component
and the y component.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.310
And then I added them together
by doing the head to tails

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.990
method, and so this is what
vector a would look like.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.440
And, instead of drawing it, a
very easy representation is

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.990
exactly what we did up here,
a unit vector notation.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.800
And what's vector b look like?

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.320
So it's 2i-- I'm going to do a
completely different color.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.680
It's 2i, so it's this vector.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.500
2 times unit vector i.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.990
That's this.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.170
Plus 4j, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.870
So it looks like this.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.240
And let's take this one and
shift it over to the left, so

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.170
we can put its tail to the
vector's head, so it would

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.140
look like this.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.370
So vector b will look --
I'll do it in red.

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.760
And I'll use a line tool.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.540
Vector b looks like this.

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.500
I just put its components head
to tails, and that's how

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.170
I got vector b.

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.480
And if I were to add
them visually.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.640
I would do it the same way that
I added its components.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.120
I would put the tail of one
vector to the head of the

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.100
other, and see if you get
the resulting vector.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.930
So you could do it either way.

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.270
Let's shift this a vector.

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.760
Let's shift it in
this direction.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.250
Remember, vectors, we're
just giving the

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.350
magnitude of direction.

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.880
We're not necessarily giving
a starting point.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.300
So you can shift them.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.600
You just can't change their
orientation or their

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.850
magnitudes.

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.930
And that's actually how you add
them, you shift them, and

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:19.970
put them head to tails.

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.690
That's when you add
them visually.

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.780
Let's put that a
vector up here.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.015
So if we have the a vector, it
looks something like this.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.700
And I want it to
work out right.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:45.640
So the a vector looks
something like that.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.280
And remember, all I did was I
took the same vector, and I

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:49.940
just shifted it.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.310
So that it can start
at the head.

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.160
So its tail can start at the
head of the b vector.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.060
I just shifted the a vector, so
this is still the a vector.

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.030
By moving the vector
around, you

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:00.340
haven't changed the vector.

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.980
I would only change the vector,
if I scaled it, if I

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.180
made it bigger or smaller, if
I changed its orientation.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.600
And so visually, this is b, this
is a, so if I add a to b,

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:14.880
the resulting vector, going head
to tails-- i'll do it in

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.700
this green color --would
look like this.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.710
It would look like that.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:25.940
So here we took all this
trouble, and I had to draw

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.630
these straight lines
to visually

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:28.710
add these two vectors.

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:31.140
This green vector is a plus b.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.170
Let's see if this green
vector is the same

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:35.540
thing that we got here.

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:39.070
Let's see if it's the
same thing as this.

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:44.660
So we got negative 1 times
i, so negative 1 is here.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.440
And then we have 6j.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.530
Let me do it in another color.

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:51.330
6j would look like this.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:52.520
6j looks like that.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.160
You put them heads to tails.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.020
And it would be something
like this.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.320
And that is the green vector.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.840
And actually, just so you know,
I know it didn't line up

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.660
perfectly, and that's because
I'm not drawing neatly, but

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:08.420
these two points should actually
be here if I were to

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:09.980
have drawn this better.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.930
But I know this is
very confusing, I

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:12.840
had all these colors.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.620
But the whole point of it is,
I wanted to show that you

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:19.440
could visually draws vectors,
and then shift them around,

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.840
and then put them
heads to tails.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.440
And then get the resulting
vector.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.170
That's one way to add vectors,
there's still no way to

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:27.280
analytically represent it.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.510
Or you could just write any
vector as its x and y

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:33.340
components, and then the sum of
the vectors is just going

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:36.409
to be the sum of the x's
and the sum of the y's.

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:39.049
And that's a much cleaner, and
a much easier, and much less

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:44.840
prone to error, way of adding
or subtracting two vectors.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.600
So hopefully that
was convincing.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:51.660
That a plus b really
is this vector.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.470
If it wasn't, I'm sorry.

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:55.620
And I hope I didn't
confuse you more.

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.240
But now that we have this out
of the way, and hopefully

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.860
you're convinced that unit
vector notation is useful.

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:04.050
We can move on and maybe try
to do some of our old

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:06.370
projectile motion problems
using this notation.
