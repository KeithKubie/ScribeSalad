00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.500
Let's tackle a slightly more
interesting division problem.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.606
So we're going to take
280 and divide it by 5.

00:00:06.606 --> 00:00:08.230
And I encourage you
to pause this video

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:09.760
and try to apply the
technique that we've

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.634
seen in a previous video
to try to figure out

00:00:11.634 --> 00:00:14.630
what 280 divided by 5 is.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:15.890
So let's have our go at it.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:16.970
So we could rewrite this.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:24.390
We've already seen this
as 280 divided by 5.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.200
So the first question
we can ask ourselves

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.300
is, how many times
does 5 go into 2?

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.360
Well, 5 doesn't
go into 2 at all.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.845
It goes 0 times.

00:00:31.845 --> 00:00:35.590
0 times 5 is 0.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:36.940
And then we subtract.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.220
2 minus 0 is 2.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.390
And now, we can bring
down the next digit,

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.139
which, in this case, is an 8.

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:45.930
And so we can ask
ourselves, how many times

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.570
does 5 go into 28
without going over it?

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.450
So we could think, well,
let's see 5 times 5 is 25.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.770
5 times 6 is 30.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.150
So 5 times 6 would go over 28.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.760
So we want to go
back to 5 times 5.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.630
So 5 goes into 28 5 times.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.280
5 times 5 is 25.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.340
And you subtract.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.490
28 minus 25 is 3.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.710
And now, let's bring
down the next digit.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.360
In this case, the digit is a 0.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.290
So how many times
does 5 go into 30?

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.830
Well, it goes exactly 6 times.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.520
We've already talked about that.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.110
6 times 5 is 30.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.350
We subtract.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.260
And we have nothing left over.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:37.830
So we just figured out that 280
divided by 5 is equal to 56.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.989
Now, why did this work?

00:01:39.989 --> 00:01:41.780
Well, the first way to
think about it, this

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:42.606
was actually 200.

00:01:42.606 --> 00:01:43.980
And we were thinking
about, do we

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.080
put anything in the
hundreds place here?

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.020
So one way of thinking about
it, how many hundreds of times

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.175
does 5 go into 200?

00:01:52.175 --> 00:01:53.800
And it doesn't go
any multiples of 100.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.930
And if that's a
little confusing,

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.140
don't worry too much about it.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.681
But I want you to
really think deeply

00:01:57.681 --> 00:01:59.190
about the place notation.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.860
But then we were able
to, again, extend

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.170
it to instead of just
200 but then 280.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.150
This 28 right over here,
if you think about it,

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.020
this 2 is in the hundreds place.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.710
This 8 is in the tens place.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.030
So this is really
representing 280.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.340
And we said, how many tens
of times does 5 go into 280?

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.220
Well, it goes 5 tens
times, or it goes 50 times.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.220
50 times 5 is 250.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.340
When you subtract 250
from 280, you've got 30.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.590
And there were no other
things in the ones place here.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.423
So we just have to
figure out how many times

00:02:30.423 --> 00:02:31.990
does 5 go into 30.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.590
So hopefully, that
gives you a sense

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.860
of what's actually happening
behind this little process.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.070
It's not just magic.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.194
We're really just keeping
track of place value here.

00:02:41.194 --> 00:02:42.610
The other thing I
want to show you

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.629
is that we didn't necessarily
have to write this 0 here.

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.170
Another way of
computing it, we could

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.465
have said 280 divided by 5.

00:02:52.465 --> 00:02:55.080
And we could've said, how
many times does 5 go into 2?

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.330
Well, it doesn't go any times.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.140
So let's just think
about 5 going into 28.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.330
Well, 5 goes into 28 5 times.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.820
5 times 5 is 25.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.020
Subtract.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.310
28 minus 25 is 3.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.190
Bring down the 0.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.690
5 goes into 30 six times.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.630
6 times 5 is 30.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.330
And we have nothing left over.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.580
And again, what
we're really saying

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.282
is that 5 doesn't go into
200 any hundreds of times.

00:03:24.282 --> 00:03:25.865
If this was a 500,
you could say, hey,

00:03:25.865 --> 00:03:27.660
it's going to go
in it 100 times.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.600
But instead, we go, well,
what about 5 going into 280?

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.080
Well, it goes 50 times.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.400
50 times 5 is 250.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.880
280 minus 250 is 30.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.870
5 goes into 30 six times.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.644
So hopefully, that makes
a little bit of sense.
