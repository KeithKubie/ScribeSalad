00:00:01.335 --> 00:00:03.604
TO MAKE AS BIG OF A SPLASH
AS POSSIBLE.

00:00:03.637 --> 00:00:05.572
SO WE GOT TO WORK COMING UP
WITH SOME SONGS

00:00:05.606 --> 00:00:07.774
THAT WE COULD PERFORM
AROUND TOWN.

00:00:07.808 --> 00:00:09.610
- SO THE EASIEST THING THAT
ANYONE WOULD RECOGNIZE

00:00:09.643 --> 00:00:13.013
IS A STONES SONG,
A ZEPPELIN SONG.

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:15.315
- YEAH, MAYBE WE COULD, LIKE,
SKEWER THEM FOR BEING OLD.

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:17.851
- RIGHT.

00:00:17.885 --> 00:00:19.686
- I CAN'T GET AN ERECTION,
BUT I TRY, BUT I TRY.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.622
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW.

00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:24.625
- WE HAD OUR FIRST SONG,
AND AFTER FINISHING THE LYRICS

00:00:24.658 --> 00:00:27.127
I BOOKED US A SPOT
AT A LOCAL OPEN MIC NIGHT

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.063
SO WE COULD BEGIN BUILDING
OUR LEGAL DEFENSE.

00:00:30.097 --> 00:00:35.068
ELIAS AND I ARE BIG FANS
OF THE ROLLING STONES.

00:00:35.102 --> 00:00:37.704
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE WERE TALKING
LATELY AND WE THOUGHT

00:00:37.738 --> 00:00:42.743
"YOU KNOW, THESE GUYS ARE KINDA
GETTING A LITTLE OLD," SO...

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.581
[strums guitar]

00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:51.718

OUR FIRST PERFORMANCE ACTUALLY
WENT PRETTY WELL.

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.936
BUT AFTER OUR SET, ELIAS
EXPRESSED SOME RESERVATIONS.

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:12.105
ARE YOU NOT CONFIDENT
IN THE LYRICS?

00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:15.442
- OKAY.

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:17.744
HE WAS TOO NERVOUS
TO GET ON STAGE AGAIN.

00:01:17.778 --> 00:01:19.580
SO AFTER WRITING MORE SONGS,

00:01:19.613 --> 00:01:22.382
I HAD TO DO THE NEXT OPEN MIC,
ON MY OWN.

I THOUGHT THE SHOW WENT OKAY,

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:51.845
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
THE AUDIENCE DIDN'T AGREE.

00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:53.213
- I DIDN'T REALLY LIKE THAT
AT ALL.

00:01:53.247 --> 00:01:55.148
- IT'S NOT REALLY MY CUP OF TEA.

00:01:55.182 --> 00:01:57.184
- HE [...] SUCKED.
