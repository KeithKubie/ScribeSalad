00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.240
Eventbrite is a
ticketing platform.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.940
We help event
organizers sell tickets,

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.390
and we help event attendees.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.210
We help consumers find great
things happening around them.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.130
We think about ourselves, not
as this monolithic ticketing

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.230
machine or beast, but
really as a platform where

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.860
you can build off
and innovate and do

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.280
so many different
creative things with that.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.810
So we've actually
opened up our platform.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.310
We've developed an API
that we have actually

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.690
thousands of developers
helping to expand our platform

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.505
and bring us into new
directions, new geographies,

00:00:46.505 --> 00:00:49.350
and new categories
through this platform.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.750
We've also just
tried to solve a lot

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.760
of the different hard problems
of what events, as a consumer,

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.790
I'd like to attend.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.410
How do you make algorithmic
recommendations?

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.900
How do you stop
fraudsters that are

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.410
trying to run money
through the system?

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.430
How do you make this
big shift to mobile

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.220
and really embrace
the revolution that's

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.840
happening on Android
to move ticketing

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.770
from this physical paper
ticket onto your mobile phone?

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.520
So there's just a myriad
of different challenges

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.840
and hard problems to solve.
