about the class of all possible monsters
 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
about the class of all possible monsters
right<00:05:36.440><c> that's</c><00:05:37.280><c> a</c><00:05:37.400><c> whole</c><00:05:37.580><c> different</c><00:05:37.610><c> thing</c>

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 align:start position:0%
right that's a whole different thing
 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.460 align:start position:0%
right that's a whole different thing
that's<00:05:38.300><c> something</c><00:05:38.630><c> that</c><00:05:38.750><c> only</c><00:05:38.930><c> human</c><00:05:39.230><c> beings</c>

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 align:start position:0%
that's something that only human beings

that's something that only human beings

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 align:start position:0%
are capable of that level of abstraction
 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.290 align:start position:0%
are capable of that level of abstraction

right and so what you might do about a

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
particular monster is hide or go out and
 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.020 align:start position:0%
particular monster is hide or go out and

get rid of it it was just an actual
 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.180 align:start position:0%
get rid of it it was just an actual
