00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.260
11 years ago, there's
something quite interesting,

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.440
because 11 years ago, we,
the College of Science,

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.720
decided to create
this lecture series,

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.920
because there was a court case
in Pennsylvania in which they

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.590
were trying to add intelligent
design to the curriculum

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.600
of the schools in Pennsylvania.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.280
And it went up to the courts.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.220
The courts decided that
intelligent design was not

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.480
science.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.610
But we here decided
at that point,

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.830
even before that court
did what they had to do--

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.390
we decided that it was
really important that people,

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.000
that the public, that
all of us should really

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.160
understand the facts
that then we're

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.160
asked to give opinions about.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.380
Reminds me of the
very famous saying

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.360
of Patrick Moynihan,
who says we're all

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.680
entitled to our facts--

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.410
sorry, we're all
entitled to our opinions,

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.006
but we're not
entitled to our facts.

00:01:08.006 --> 00:01:10.446
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.760
So 11 years ago, we
started in the Center

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.540
for Creative Photography,
where there are 250 seats.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.680
And clearly, there was
enormous interest in the topic.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.660
And then, we just continued.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.180
And interestingly
enough, 11 years since,

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.050
we're here, debating facts.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.040
So I think more important
than ever, it is for all of us

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.770
to understand truly
what the facts are,

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.260
make our intelligent
opinions on the facts.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.210
So more important than ever,
lecture series like these

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.280
are quite topical.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:02.160
So this lecture series is funded
by great folks in the community

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.730
that I think we
should all appreciate.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.319
Tucson Electric Power.

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:07.860
Let me just say them
all, and then we

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.449
can give an applause
to all of them.

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:12.840
Ventana Medical Systems,
the Arizona Daily Star,

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.750
Cox Communication,
Galileo Circle.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.470
And if any of you want a good
seat, join the Galileo Circle

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.700
and also support the community
through your efforts.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.550
Godat Design,
Holualoa Companies,

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.360
the Marshall Foundation,
Nguyen and Tarbet Patent Law,

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.810
Raytheon, Research Corporation
for Science Advancement,

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.610
and Vantage West Credit Union.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.104
How about if we just give them
all a big round of applause?

00:02:38.104 --> 00:02:40.996
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.940
So for 10 years, we've
been pushing the envelope

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.820
of describing interesting facts
that we now know as scientists,

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.790
which in fact are
central to the debate

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.290
that we are in in the
policy and political arena.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.870
Last year was about global
climate change, for example.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.600
We've talked about the genome.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.560
All of you have had some
skirmish with one or the other.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.980
And we can go on and on.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.660
Facts are important.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.700
And that's what this
lecture series is all about.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.370
So now, we're really
getting into--

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.880
and by the way, the title
of "Rethinking Reality"

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.120
was before the election.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.690
So it has nothing
to do with politics.

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.640
It has to do with physics.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.040
But you can make your own
opinion about the facts.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.330
And today, we're going to
talk about how physics,

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.350
since the inception of physics,
has been trying to understand

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.140
the universe that
we live in and how,

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.560
as we move farther and farther
away from what we really

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.790
observe, what we're
evolutionary-wise

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.210
capable of accepting,
coming to the opinion

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.750
or coming to the conclusion
that the universe is incredibly

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.560
weird.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.520
So today, Keith Dienes
is going to give us

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.100
a presentation that
will try to set up

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.374
the lectures for the
rest of the time.

00:04:12.374 --> 00:04:14.540
We're going to have five
of these lectures about how

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.860
physics behaves at very high
pressures and temperatures,

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.260
what the quantum
world is all about,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.370
what the very small world of
particle physics is all about.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.030
All of that is what I hope we
will all learn about today.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.380
So Keith received his bachelor's
from Princeton, his master's

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.220
and PhD from Cornell,
came here to the U of A,

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.100
after he held post-doc
positions at McGill University

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.740
in Montreal, at the
Institute for Advanced

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.640
Study in Princeton,
and at CERN in Geneva.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.380
This is typical of
our faculty members

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.210
here in the College of Science.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.420
Most recently, Keith has been
engaged in public service.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.090
And he's a program director
for the Theoretical High-Energy

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.640
Physics and Cosmology at the
National Science Foundation

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.630
in Washington DC, where he
oversees the funding of fields

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.140
across the entire US and helps
to develop federal science

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.270
policy in these fields.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.790
Keith's primary interests are
in theoretical high-energy

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.230
physics.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.090
He focuses on new
ideas for physics

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.280
beyond the so-called standard
model of particle physics.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.920
These ideas include
supersymmetry,

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.720
grand unification, large extra
dimensions, and ultimately,

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.700
string theory.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.890
Most recently, he has been
developing a new approach

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:31.450
to the dark matter problem.

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.210
You'll hear throughout
this lecture series

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.140
that astronomers and
astrophysicists have decided

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.880
that most of the
universe is made out

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.010
of dark matter and dark energy.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:46.690
So there's no poetry in it,
but that's what they know.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.160
And he's working on that.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.490
His results have been featured
in Scientific American, The New

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.730
Scientist, Science
Magazine, and Physics Today.

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.670
And he's a fellow of the
American Physical Society.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:01.583
Please help me
welcome Keith Dienes.

00:06:01.583 --> 00:06:04.048
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.542
Well, it's a
pleasure to be here.

00:06:22.542 --> 00:06:24.250
I'm really happy to
see a large audience.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.010
I won't say it's the
largest ever existed, maybe.

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:32.920
But it certainly is gratifying
to see so many people

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.750
interested in science.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.620
And that's what's
great, I think.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.476
So this year, the University
of Arizona College

00:06:41.476 --> 00:06:42.850
of Science Lecture
Series will be

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:46.240
focusing on some
extraordinarily big questions.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.574
And you see them here.

00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:49.240
What are the fundamental
building blocks

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.569
of the physical world?

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:53.110
What are the different kinds of
glue that hold these building

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:54.610
blocks together?

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.490
What happens at the extremes
of matter and energy, space

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.370
and time?

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.400
What are the laws that govern
the behavior of all things,

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.940
large and small,
seen and unseen?

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.200
Where do these laws come from?

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.283
And what do they tell us
about the birth and death

00:07:09.283 --> 00:07:12.550
of the universe and
everything in between?

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.900
So through the upcoming
weeks, four physicists

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.030
will be here, in addition
to me, to tell you

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:19.860
about their cutting-edge
research that

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:23.220
pushes the frontiers in
attempting to understand

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.140
and answer these questions.

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:26.940
But we had
organizational meetings

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.350
to plan this lecture series.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:32.490
And as we were talking, we felt
that something was lacking.

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:35.100
Most people, we thought,
really have a general idea

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.310
of what chemistry is
or what biology is.

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:40.500
But what exactly is physics?

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.260
How is physics different
from the other sciences?

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.900
What are the big
ideas in physics?

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.400
Is there a corresponding
big picture

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.890
that physicists carry
around in their heads

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.930
when they think about
the natural world?

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:57.561
So that's really going to be the
goal of this kickoff lecture.

00:07:57.561 --> 00:08:00.060
Rather than tell you about my
own research, which I will not

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:03.244
do, I'll instead aim to
provide a leisurely tour

00:08:03.244 --> 00:08:05.160
through some of the most
cutting-edge concepts

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.972
in modern physics.

00:08:06.972 --> 00:08:08.430
And taken together,
all these ideas

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:11.370
are shaping the big picture
that physicists have ultimately

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:14.700
formed about the universe
and the laws that govern it.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.430
And this is, ultimately, part
of how physicists are currently

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:19.530
rethinking the rules of reality.

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:21.360
So this won't be physics 101.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.520
The ideas won't be elementary.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.150
Rather, this will be physics
500, really the cutting edge

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.440
concepts, but all
explained, hopefully,

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.920
at a very non-technical level.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.120
So that's the goal.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.730
Now, the title of my
slide is "Rethinking

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:35.650
the Rules of Reality."

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:38.780
And this is, if you think about
it, a rather strange title.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:42.694
It has three components--
rules, rethinking, and reality.

00:08:42.694 --> 00:08:44.360
And in this lecture,
what I'd like to do

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:48.600
is discuss each
of these in turn.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.430
But first, we should start
with what physics is.

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:53.360
What is physics?

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:57.380
If you go up to the street and
ask a random person walking

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:59.720
around to name the most
intelligent person who ever

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.870
lived, you might get--
and people do this, often

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:04.604
on late night talk shows.

00:09:04.604 --> 00:09:06.020
You might get a
lot of responses--

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:09.410
Shakespeare or Bach or Mozart
or Beethoven or maybe Charles

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:10.400
Darwin.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:17.210
But far and away, the number
one answer is a physicist.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:19.160
And you all know who he is.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.740
So if you start to narrow the
question down-- say, well,

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.710
amongst living
people, who is it?

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:27.810
The number one answer,
again, is another physicist.

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:31.610
This is Stephen Hawking,
a British cosmologist.

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:36.810
If Hollywood wants to portray
smart people, what do they do?

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:41.610
Again, they make them into
physicists, plus an engineer

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:46.410
without a PhD, but he's
allowed to hang around also.

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:48.810
If you ask people, what are
the most famous equations

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:51.340
in all of science?

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:56.100
Well, they also are equations
that come from physics,

00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:00.150
E equals mc squared
and F equals ma.

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:05.310
What is the reason for this
fascination with physics?

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:08.920
Ultimately, I think it's
because physics is different.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.600
Physicists tend
to view the world

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.850
in strange, abstract ways.

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:14.350
And I want to give
you some examples

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:15.470
of what I mean by this.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:20.040
If you study how the
gravitational attraction

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.650
of the sun causes
the planets to move

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:24.690
in stable elliptical
orbits around it,

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:26.880
you're likely to
be an astronomer.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.225
And astronomers have done
this for many, many years.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.510
If you study how the
massive forces involved

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:36.940
in tectonic shift
cause mountains

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.490
to rise and the
earthquakes to occur,

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:41.030
you're likely to be a geologist.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:46.940
If you study how an organism
swims through a fluid using

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:50.180
its flagella, or how a
hummingbird beats its wings so

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:53.120
as to remain stationary
above a flower,

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:56.490
you're likely to be a biologist.

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:59.730
If you study how the
electric fields involved

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:02.730
in forming chemical bonds
prevent the individual atoms

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:05.190
in a molecule from moving
around freely, thereby

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:08.700
forming a stable crystal,
you're likely to be a chemist

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.292
or a material scientist.

00:11:11.292 --> 00:11:14.510
But a physicist?

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:18.280
Well, a physicist looks at all
of those situations and says,

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.350
well, in each case,
there is a force

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:22.770
being applied to an object.

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:25.070
And that force results
in a certain change

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:28.790
in the motion of that object,
either creating motion

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:31.230
or maintaining equilibrium.

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:35.560
Let's just study the notion of
force as an abstract entity.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.370
And let's also just study
motion and equilibrium

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:40.470
as abstract entities.

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:42.090
We don't need to
specify whether we're

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:45.930
talking about planets or
continents or hummingbirds

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:47.640
or chemical bonds.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.830
And now we can ask
the general questions.

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:52.830
How is force related to motion?

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:55.230
When do forces
produce equilibrium?

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:57.740
When don't they?

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:00.240
Note that we're seeking
universal truths,

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:04.140
abstract truths, statements
about how the universe operates

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:09.430
at all times, in all places,
in all circumstances.

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:12.870
These are the physical laws
that we seek to uncover,

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:15.880
the physical laws that
underpin all things.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.790
And we're seeking to
understand their consequences.

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:21.460
This is physics.

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:24.030
Now, I've said physical laws.

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:27.240
But, in fact, these physical
laws are nothing but the rules

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.100
that we're talking
about, the rules

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.260
that govern the natural
world as we know it.

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:36.890
So let me give you an example.

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:40.340
You've all heard this
equation, F equals ma.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:41.660
It's the discovery of Newton.

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:43.970
It's his so-called second law.

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:46.430
What it means is that
forces acting on objects

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:48.432
cause them to accelerate.

00:12:48.432 --> 00:12:50.980
Now, it turns out
that this is true,

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:55.540
no matter what the object is, no
matter what produces the force.

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.910
Now, this law may seem obvious.

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:02.530
But for 2,000 years, humanity
was confused about this

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:05.430
and actually believed
something different.

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:07.200
What was believed
was that forces

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:11.790
were necessary to induce
and sustain motion.

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:13.330
That's wrong.

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.990
Instead, we now
know, since Newton,

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:19.800
that forces are only
necessary to change motion,

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:23.070
not to cause it or sustain
it, but to change it,

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:26.130
to produce acceleration.

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:29.660
It's the job of physicists
to propose such laws

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:33.170
and to test them in a
variety of circumstances.

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:36.720
Ultimately, through repeated
experimental conformation,

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.884
we come to believe in
the validity of a law

00:13:38.884 --> 00:13:40.175
as a universal truth of nature.

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:44.520
I'll give you another
Newton-based example.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.320
This one is a little
more interesting.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:52.330
We just saw the apple fall
through from the tree,

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.400
to the Earth from
the top of the tree.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.910
It's the usual, well-known
story that Newton

00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:59.770
sat under the apple
tree, and the apple

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:02.020
fell and hit him on the head.

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:03.610
And he then, according
to the story,

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:08.650
realized that this is the result
of the same force, gravity,

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:12.454
that's responsible for the
moon orbiting the Earth.

00:14:12.454 --> 00:14:14.120
But you've heard this
story, but you may

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.010
have thought, how can that be?

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:19.520
The moon never crashes into
the Earth like the apple.

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:23.800
These appear to be
different phenomena.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:27.520
What Newton realized in that
moment is that they're not.

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.310
In each case, gravity
does the same thing.

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:32.380
It pulls an object
directly towards the center

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:33.990
of the Earth.

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:36.440
Now, for the apple, that was
the only motion there was.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.398
So that's all that
occurred, and the apple just

00:14:38.398 --> 00:14:40.080
fell directly to the Earth.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.900
For the moon, however, there
was another tangential velocity

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.070
already existing.

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:46.110
The moon was already
moving parallel

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:48.060
to the Earth's
surface, tangentially

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:49.690
toward the horizon.

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:53.760
So the combination of falling
and that tangential velocity

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:57.105
together traced out
that curved orbit.

00:14:57.105 --> 00:15:01.850
But in each case, the
gravity part was universal.

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:04.590
And it does only one thing,
pulls toward the center.

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:10.280
The commonality and
universality of physical law,

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.500
the idea that the same
principles might underlie

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.690
different phenomena,
is not always obvious,

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:18.300
as we see from this example.

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:21.900
As in the case of the falling
apple versus the stable lunar

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:26.190
orbit, the phenomena themselves
might look very different.

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:29.910
And they might have vastly
different implications.

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:34.110
Now, if we were content to
understand each phenomenon

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:37.870
separately on its own
terms, which is fine,

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:41.850
but we might then miss the
deeper common structure.

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:45.570
It's the job of the physicist
to probe more deeply

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:48.510
and uncover and discover the
commonalities that underlie

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:51.480
the workings of the universe
at their deepest and most

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:52.280
abstract levels.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:58.560
Now, all good science,
really, starts

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.900
with observation and
then classification,

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:03.860
based on similarities
and differences.

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:08.420
However, physicists aim
to do something further,

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:10.627
to extract underlying
principles,

00:16:10.627 --> 00:16:12.710
the underlying physical
laws, the rules that we've

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:15.200
been talking about, even
if they look different

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:18.650
in different contexts, as in
the apple case with the moon.

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:20.810
And then, to use these
physical laws in order

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:23.300
to predict phenomena,
which are not

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:27.290
yet seen, perhaps with energies
or sizes or temperatures which

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:30.670
have never been probed before,
or new settings which have

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:33.150
never been explored before.

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:35.580
Sometimes, the laws of
physics, as we formulated them,

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:38.820
then work well in these new
contexts, and we say, great.

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:40.796
We believe in it even more.

00:16:40.796 --> 00:16:42.420
However, sometimes
they don't work well

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:44.280
in these new contexts.

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.110
And they then
require reformulation

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:49.590
into new, more general laws,
whose scope of validity

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:52.380
is even larger than
they were before.

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:53.794
Thus, laws are not abandoned.

00:16:53.794 --> 00:16:55.710
We don't just say, oh,
we thought it was true,

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:58.240
but now it's completely
false, and we throw it away.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:01.470
Instead, laws are
constantly incorporated

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:03.990
into bigger, more
complete structures,

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:05.550
more complete structures.

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:07.077
And this is how
our field advances.

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:14.800
Now, as with any branch of
science, input from experiment

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.530
is critical.

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:18.630
Scientific progress,
especially in physics,

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:21.740
is a dialogue between
experiment and theory.

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:28.930
Experimentalists communicate
directly with nature.

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:31.180
They're the ones who actually
talk to nature directly,

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:33.480
because they take
direct measurements.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.440
Nature talks to them.

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:38.340
It's a special, special role,
really, for experimentalists.

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:40.770
And they do this by building
sophisticated experiments

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:45.340
in the cleverest ways,
in order to extract data.

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:49.870
By contrast, theorists
then take this data

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:51.850
and interpret it in terms
of the physical laws

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:54.760
and the fundamental
principles they've developed.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:57.370
If necessary, they
hypothesize extensions

00:17:57.370 --> 00:17:59.770
of these laws and principles.

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:01.990
They then propose new
ideas and predictions,

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:06.250
which experimentalists
then proceed to test.

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:09.730
Thus, the field really
walks on two legs,

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:13.740
shifting back and forth between
experimentalists and theorists.

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.520
Now, many fields of
study have people

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:19.880
who tend to be more involved in
a laboratory setting and people

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.730
who tend to be maybe more
running numerical simulations

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:24.860
or working on blackboards.

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:28.640
But physics tends to be one
of the most extreme in having

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:32.990
a dichotomy between
experimentalists and theorists,

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:36.020
to the extent that almost
no functioning physicist

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.590
today does both.

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:39.020
And it's a shame.

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:41.360
But we need such
specialized training

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.430
that very early on,
when you're growing up

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:46.370
and you're a would-be physicist,
you know, in your heart,

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:49.340
you're either going to be an
experimentalist or a theorist.

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:51.470
Most of us choose when
we're undergrads or maybe

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:52.897
graduate students.

00:18:52.897 --> 00:18:54.980
I was in charge of our
graduate program admissions

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:57.680
here for a long time at the U
of A in the physics department.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.180
And one of the first
things you look

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.860
at when you're opening a
folder for an applicant

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:02.651
is, is this going to
be an experimentalist?

00:19:02.651 --> 00:19:04.274
Or is this going
to be a theorist?

00:19:04.274 --> 00:19:06.440
Because this is right away
the first, most important

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.780
question that you want
to know about the person.

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:11.350
It identifies them.

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:13.300
Now, I've been talking
about understanding

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:15.640
the fundamental laws.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.890
But that's not all.

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:20.710
As you know from, for
example, playing chess,

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:25.060
you can know the rules that
govern how each piece moves,

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:27.370
and still you have no
idea how to play the game,

00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:29.320
have no concept of the
grand strategies that

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:32.044
will result in victory.

00:19:32.044 --> 00:19:34.210
There's more to actually
playing a game than knowing

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:35.920
these fundamental rules.

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:39.190
And similarly, in
parallel with the process

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:41.800
of discovering new physical
law, physicists also

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.480
have to do something else.

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.600
They work hard to use these
laws with increasing power

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.990
and sophistication, in order
to understand and predict

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:53.590
phenomena of ever
increasing complexity

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:55.930
across the entire
spectrum of science,

00:19:55.930 --> 00:20:00.190
everything from material science
and chemistry and biology,

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:02.830
all the way to astrophysics
or nuclear science or quantum

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:06.370
science or engineering
or complexity theory.

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:11.440
In each case, what one finds is
that new emergent phenomena can

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:14.680
appear that might not have
been anticipated based

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.110
on the fundamental laws alone.

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:20.980
Having more elements in
your system, having more

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:22.420
produces different behavior.

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.600
More leads to different.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.845
Physicists, nevertheless,
study all these behaviors

00:20:26.845 --> 00:20:29.950
from their uniquely
abstract perspective.

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:31.600
Thus, I think it's
fair to say, physics

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:35.066
sits at the foundation
of most sciences

00:20:35.066 --> 00:20:36.440
that deal with
the natural world.

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:42.800
Now, historically,
physics has gone

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:46.040
through many major upheavals,
in which a set of laws

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.920
were recognized
not to be complete,

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.900
and were slowly
and painstakingly

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:56.240
understood to be mere special
cases of more general laws.

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:59.930
This has caused physicists
to continually rethink

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:03.150
the very nature of the rules
that govern the universe.

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:05.310
This is the rethinking part.

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:08.810
Now, we don't do this randomly.

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:12.530
In general, as we grope to
develop new, more sophisticated

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:16.760
rules, we're guided by a
number of profound concepts

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:19.130
that seem to underlie
almost everything we

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:21.780
know about the natural world.

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:26.290
One important guide that
physicists use is symmetry.

00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:28.580
And I'm sure you all
have an idea of symmetry.

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:31.460
Symmetry is everywhere
in the natural world.

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.320
There are many different
kinds of symmetry.

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:35.264
Here's a left/right
reflection symmetry.

00:21:35.264 --> 00:21:37.180
The left side and the
right side are the same.

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:39.970
If you just put this
picture in a mirror image,

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:42.290
it would look identical.

00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:44.290
There are other kinds of
symmetries-- rotational

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:47.630
symmetries, 3-fold symmetries,
4-fold, the cloverleaf,

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:51.820
5-fold, as in the jellyfish,
6-fold, as in the tapestry,

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:52.390
9-fold.

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:55.810
That is an aerial view of
a Bahá'í temple in India.

00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:58.631
10-fold, that is a diamond.

00:21:58.631 --> 00:22:00.130
There are other
kinds of symmetries,

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:02.500
for example, lattice
symmetries, where,

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.570
again, if you know
a fundamental cell,

00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:07.630
it fills out the whole
plane in the same way.

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:09.130
There can be
cylindrical symmetries,

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:10.796
where you have a
symmetry about rotating

00:22:10.796 --> 00:22:14.380
around a central vertical
axis, as in the tin can

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:16.110
or in the vase.

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:19.850
Finally, you can even have
the spherical symmetry.

00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:21.880
Here's an example of a sphere.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:25.410
Now, you can ask, why are
symmetries so important?

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:29.120
Why does nature care
about symmetries?

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.270
Well, there's one, I think,
very profound reason.

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:40.110
Symmetry produces pizza.

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:44.350
No, symmetries are
important because, I think,

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:48.130
they allow us to describe
a lot of information

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:50.800
about an entire
object using only

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:52.900
a little bit of information.

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:55.846
For example, if an object
has a left/right symmetry,

00:22:55.846 --> 00:22:57.220
then if I tell
you everything you

00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:58.900
need to know about
the left side,

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:00.790
you already know the right side.

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:02.350
It's very efficient.

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:05.182
If an object has a rotational
symmetry, like the pizza,

00:23:05.182 --> 00:23:06.640
then if I tell you
what's happening

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:10.210
in one slice or one
wedge, you already

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:12.980
know what the whole
thing is like.

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:16.090
In the case of a lattice,
you know the entire picture

00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:19.060
just by describing
one central cell.

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:20.650
So nature, I think,
loves symmetries

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:24.130
because of the efficiencies
they encapsulate.

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:26.740
However, as we'll
see, physicists also

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:30.310
love symmetries, because
they simplify the situation,

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:31.930
and they enable us
to solve problems

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:36.540
that might be too complex
to solve in other ways.

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:38.930
Now, there's another
idea that guides

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:42.140
physicists when we're
looking to understand

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:44.120
how to rethink things.

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:47.580
And that has to do
with conservation laws.

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:49.710
The basic idea is that
in certain situations,

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:51.870
a physical quantity,
some number,

00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:53.600
some quantity that
we use to describe

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.537
the system is conserved.

00:23:56.537 --> 00:23:59.120
And what that means is that even
though the system may evolve,

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:02.639
and its characteristics may
change as a function of time,

00:24:02.639 --> 00:24:04.430
certain quantities that
describe the system

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:08.450
are nevertheless the same or
fixed at all moments in time.

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:10.280
And perhaps the easiest
example, the one

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:13.700
you're most familiar with,
is conservation of energy.

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:16.190
For example,
consider a pendulum.

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:20.790
What's happening is that the
height that exists at the edges

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:23.169
is, by the time you come
to the middle, traded.

00:24:23.169 --> 00:24:23.835
You lose height.

00:24:23.835 --> 00:24:25.920
And instead, you gain speed.

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:30.294
So height is traded for
speed, and back and forth.

00:24:30.294 --> 00:24:31.960
Something is conserved,
because we don't

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.730
have height when we have speed.

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:35.110
It's traded back and forth.

00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:37.660
What's conserved is the
total energy of the system.

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:46.360
The ideas of symmetries
and conservation laws

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.640
are very old ones in physics.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.650
They go back to Newton.

00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:54.670
But remarkably, it wasn't
until the early 20th century

00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:57.700
that a connection was actually
found between symmetries

00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:59.680
and conservation laws.

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:05.220
In my opinion, this connection
represents possibly the most

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:09.540
profound discovery in all of
theoretical and mathematical

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:11.410
physics.

00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:15.940
And it states nothing more than
if a physical system exhibits

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:19.390
a continuous symmetry, then
a corresponding quantity

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:21.700
must always be conserved.

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:24.280
In other words,
for each symmetry,

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.740
there is a corresponding
conserved quantity,

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:30.220
and vice versa, a
corresponding conservation law.

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:33.730
So two of the deepest concepts
in theoretical physics,

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:35.140
symmetries and
conservation laws,

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:38.020
are actually fused into one.

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:41.620
I'll give you an
example of this.

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:46.360
Here we have an experiment
that we are preparing to do,

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:49.210
maybe at 8:20 in the morning.

00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:52.000
Most scientists are not in
the office at 8:20 in the--

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.010
let's make this PM.

00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:58.810
And they do the experiment.

00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:00.970
And they drop the thing
in, and it turns yellow.

00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:03.220
And they say, aha.

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:05.050
OK.

00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:10.650
Now, they may repeat the
experiment later at 10:10,

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:13.960
and again, drop it in.

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.670
They should get
the same results,

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:18.370
because the laws of
physics should not

00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:20.410
care whether the
experiment was done

00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:23.700
at 8 o'clock or 10 o'clock.

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:27.810
In other words, if the laws have
this property that it doesn't

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:30.570
matter when you
do the experiment,

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:33.510
then this connection I
was telling you about

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:36.340
says that there is a
conserved quantity.

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:39.050
And the conserved
quantity is energy.

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:41.670
And this system must
conserve energy.

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:45.880
So somehow, time is
connecting to energy.

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:51.520
Completely mysterious, but this
is what this theorem tells us.

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.990
Now, this connection between
symmetries and conserved

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:57.340
quantities really does represent
a fundamental observation

00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:58.310
and theorem.

00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:01.150
It's actually a theorem,
proven mathematically,

00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:05.410
about how nature works at the
deepest, most abstract level.

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:07.960
And as you might imagine, the
ramifications of a theorem

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:12.160
like this reach to any physical
system that can be imagined,

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:16.390
determining what processes
may occur and which ones not.

00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:19.267
The ones that conserve the
conserved quantity would,

00:27:19.267 --> 00:27:21.850
and the ones that don't conserve
the conserved quantity cannot

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:25.151
occur, because they would be
violating the conservation law.

00:27:25.151 --> 00:27:26.650
Although this theorem
was originally

00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:30.130
formulated in classical
Newtonian mechanics,

00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:33.190
it extends readily to
relativistic situations

00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:35.540
and even quantum mechanics.

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:38.500
Its implications extend
across all of physics,

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:41.020
from subatomic physics
to entire galaxies

00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:43.450
and everything in between.

00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:44.860
In fact, I'm not
the only one who

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:49.160
thinks this is an amazing
result in theoretical physics.

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:50.750
Two physicists
who recently wrote

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:53.090
this book have said,
this is "certainly

00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:55.370
one of the most important
mathematical theorems ever

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:58.460
proved in guiding the
development of modern physics,

00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:02.130
possibly on a par with
the Pythagorean theorem,"

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:04.392
which is about the
sides of triangles,

00:28:04.392 --> 00:28:05.600
proved by the Ancient Greeks.

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.400
We're saying for
2,000 years, this

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:09.830
might be the most
important result.

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:12.710
So you might wonder who
is the physicist who

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:15.099
actually discovered this?

00:28:15.099 --> 00:28:16.640
Why haven't you
heard of this person?

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:18.800
Well, this is her name.

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:19.765
She's Emmy Noether.

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:26.870
She was born in Erlangen,
Germany in 1882.

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:28.610
She studied
mathematics, but only

00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:31.130
by special permission,
because it wasn't permitted

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:32.750
for women in those
days in Germany

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:35.930
to study subjects
such as mathematics.

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:37.610
So she had to get
special permission.

00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:42.800
But she did and got her PhD
from the University of Erlangen.

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:45.710
They were happy to keep her,
working in their research

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:49.670
facilities, but
without pay, of course,

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:53.330
for the next seven years, before
she moved to the University

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:57.710
of Göttingen, also in Germany,
where she spent the next four

00:28:57.710 --> 00:29:01.790
years lecturing under the
name of male colleagues.

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:03.740
They felt that,
well, she couldn't

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:05.190
teach a course by herself.

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:10.190
So she had pretend that she's
substituting for somebody else.

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:13.640
Again, this was the prejudice
against female physicists

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.430
at the time.

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:16.210
But she did this.

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:18.130
And her fame was
readily apparent.

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:19.660
And she had loads
of students who

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:21.220
wanted to follow
her around campus,

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:23.680
taking whatever courses
she was teaching.

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.440
Her fame grew in both
mathematics and physics,

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.900
ultimately culminating
in her plenary lecture

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:32.421
to the International Conference
of Mathematicians in 1932

00:29:32.421 --> 00:29:32.920
in Zurich.

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:35.300
This is a big deal.

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:38.470
But when the Nazis dismissed
Jews from faculty positions

00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:40.720
in Germany, she had to escape.

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:43.660
And so she moved to Bryn
Mawr College in the US

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:46.870
and died two years later
in 1935 of complications

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:49.900
from surgery for
an ovarian cyst.

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:51.315
So died in midlife.

00:29:51.315 --> 00:29:52.690
It's a wonder what
she might have

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:55.185
done if she had lived longer.

00:29:55.185 --> 00:29:56.560
When she died,
The New York Times

00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:00.450
would not publish a eulogy.

00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:03.690
But Albert Einstein felt
compelled to at least write

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:05.700
a letter, a tribute.

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:08.220
And he wrote that "in the
judgment of the most competent

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:10.860
living mathematicians,
Fraeulein Noether

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:14.880
was the most significant
creative mathematical genius

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:18.520
thus far produced since the
higher education of women

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.100
began."

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:25.080
That's high praise, coming
from Albert Einstein, no less.

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:28.710
So using ideas
like these, physics

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:30.780
has advanced through
many different conceptual

00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:32.760
revolutions.

00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:34.950
Each one called for
a radical rethinking

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:37.645
of the fundamental
rules of the game.

00:30:37.645 --> 00:30:40.020
So what I'd like to do now,
in the next part of the talk,

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:42.420
is just take a quick,
brief tour through some

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:44.910
of these conceptual
revolutions in physics.

00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:47.044
My list is not complete.

00:30:47.044 --> 00:30:49.710
I'm sure other people would have
put different items on the list

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:51.397
and taken off from the list.

00:30:51.397 --> 00:30:52.980
But this gives you
a sense of the kind

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:54.810
of rethinking that
we're constantly

00:30:54.810 --> 00:30:57.399
having to do as physicists.

00:30:57.399 --> 00:30:59.190
So, of course, our
field, like many things,

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:00.762
starts with the ancient Greeks.

00:31:00.762 --> 00:31:02.220
In some sense, they
were important,

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:03.660
because they were
the first to ask

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:06.330
the same kinds of questions,
the fundamental questions

00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:07.980
that we ask.

00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:10.950
But our field really got going
with the Newtonian revolution

00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:12.540
in the late 1600s.

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:15.090
This is the modern
birth of our field.

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:18.030
What it did was it established
a clear mathematical set

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:21.330
of principia,
principles, upon which

00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:27.420
the entire structure of the
universe was supposed to rest.

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:31.990
Another big breakthrough-- here,
I'll attribute this to Maxwell.

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:34.470
Maxwell was a
British mathematician

00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:38.220
and British physicist
in the mid-1800s.

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:40.740
He worked on
electromagnetic theory

00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:44.310
and fused electric
and magnetic phenomena

00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:48.480
into a single framework, which
we now call electromagnetism.

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:51.960
Before him, people believed
that electric fields

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:56.150
and magnetic fields were
distinct, separate things.

00:31:56.150 --> 00:31:59.860
But what we've learned now
is that if an electric field

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:03.250
varies in space-- it's different
in different places in space

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:05.640
or different in time,
and it fluctuates--

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:09.490
then that immediately pops into
existence a magnetic field.

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:11.980
And likewise, if a
magnetic field varies,

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:14.530
that pops into existence
an electric field.

00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:19.600
Together, they're unified to
produce electromagnetic waves.

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:20.950
This was his big discovery.

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:22.783
And not only that, the
electromagnetic waves

00:32:22.783 --> 00:32:24.870
move at the speed of light.

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:26.620
So somehow, now, there's
a deep connection

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:29.650
between electromagnetism and
light, which hadn't really

00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:33.820
been understood before, but
now it becomes apparent.

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:37.390
Another great development was
the atomic principle, the idea

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:39.550
that matter is discrete.

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:43.150
Before this
realization, matter was

00:32:43.150 --> 00:32:45.790
considered to be a dense,
continuous, pudding-like

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:46.930
substance.

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:49.540
No matter how much you
zoomed in and looked

00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:51.370
at little pieces of it
and broke them apart

00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:53.410
and looked at further
little pieces of it,

00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:55.810
it always appeared to
be a continuous pudding.

00:32:55.810 --> 00:32:58.640
This is what people
believed would be the case.

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:01.330
But we actually know now
that matter is ultimately

00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:07.690
made of discrete atoms, and
each atom is mostly empty space.

00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:10.450
That's kind of strange.

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:12.310
Another major
development had to do

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:15.110
with what I'll call statistical
mechanics and thermodynamics.

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:17.500
This is also the late 1800s.

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:20.830
This is Newtonian
physics applied

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:25.097
to the realm of the very
many, the very many particles.

00:33:25.097 --> 00:33:26.680
And when you have
very many particles,

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:28.810
they can have a temperature.

00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:31.180
And what was
believed at the time

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:33.064
was that-- well,
people knew about heat.

00:33:33.064 --> 00:33:35.230
But they didn't know that
heat was a form of energy,

00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:36.790
that it can be
traded back and forth

00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:39.100
for other kinds of energy,
like kinetic energy

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:40.930
or potential energy.

00:33:40.930 --> 00:33:44.410
But this was the discovery that
heat is another form of energy.

00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:46.850
That enabled the development
of the laws of thermodynamics

00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:49.270
and the recognition
that systems tend

00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:53.652
to evolve in the direction
of increasing disorder.

00:33:53.652 --> 00:33:56.110
And I'm sure many of you are
familiar with this phenomenon.

00:33:56.110 --> 00:34:00.250
Your desk never happens
to get neater by itself.

00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:03.220
Things evolve in the direction
of increasing disorder.

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:06.190
You'll be happy to know
this is a law of physics.

00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:08.489
And you can use
that as an excuse

00:34:08.489 --> 00:34:12.280
any time somebody says, why are
things always getting messier?

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:13.719
But it's true.

00:34:13.719 --> 00:34:16.280
If you see a glass
of milk fall off

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:18.280
a table, shatter on the
floor, and the milk goes

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:20.290
flying in all the
different directions,

00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:21.790
and you run the
movie backwards, you

00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:23.679
would find that the
milk would collect,

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:26.290
and the glass would
pop up onto the table.

00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:28.570
You know which way is
the correct direction

00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:31.125
of time for the movie.

00:34:31.125 --> 00:34:35.270
But the reason is
because of these results.

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:38.929
This sets a preferred
direction for the flow of time.

00:34:38.929 --> 00:34:41.239
The physicist who
really pioneered this

00:34:41.239 --> 00:34:43.429
was named Boltzmann.

00:34:43.429 --> 00:34:45.139
And he was very
concerned about this.

00:34:45.139 --> 00:34:47.510
He had developed this
result that there

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:49.100
was a preferred direction.

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:52.550
But in order to
develop these results,

00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:55.639
he used Newtonian equations.

00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:57.890
Newtonian physics
has the property

00:34:57.890 --> 00:34:59.390
that if you take
time to minus time,

00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:01.098
if you run the movie
forward or backward,

00:35:01.098 --> 00:35:02.410
it doesn't make a difference.

00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:04.837
If two billiard balls
collide that way,

00:35:04.837 --> 00:35:06.920
that's the same thing as
if they collide that way.

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:10.700
Newtonian physics doesn't
really seem to care.

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:13.370
And yet, he somehow, when
considering lots of particles,

00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:15.620
found that systems
tend to evolve

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:17.707
in the direction of
increasing disorder.

00:35:17.707 --> 00:35:19.290
He was giving public
lectures on this.

00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:23.267
This was his major lifework, his
biggest result in his career.

00:35:23.267 --> 00:35:25.850
And one day, somebody asked him
from the back of the audience,

00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:27.230
but wait a minute.

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:29.030
You started with
equations that had

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:31.672
this property that you could run
the movie forward or backward.

00:35:31.672 --> 00:35:33.880
And now you're claiming
there's a result that there's

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:34.796
a preferred direction.

00:35:34.796 --> 00:35:36.480
How can that be?

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:38.610
He didn't know the answer.

00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:41.640
He worried about
this for a long time.

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:45.210
Eventually, this
drove him to suicide,

00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:49.560
which is not a good example
of work-life balance,

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:51.180
and also the reason
why, perhaps, I'm

00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:56.440
glad there won't be a question
and answer session after this.

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:59.350
Another revolution that
happened rather quickly

00:35:59.350 --> 00:36:01.610
was special relativity.

00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:03.280
This is Newtonian
physics extended

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:06.010
to the realm of the very fast.

00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:08.950
And here, what you found
were remarkable things.

00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:11.380
No matter how long or hard
you push on an object,

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:14.740
you can never make it go
faster than the speed of light.

00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:16.930
That's not expected.

00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:19.150
People moving with
different velocities

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:24.370
seem to see the same objects
as having different sizes.

00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:26.290
So if I'm looking
at a house, and I

00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:29.621
see it has a certain size, but
somebody on a train moving by,

00:36:29.621 --> 00:36:31.120
looking at the same
house, would say

00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:33.730
it has a different
size than I see.

00:36:33.730 --> 00:36:36.430
Speed distorts reality.

00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:39.730
But this is also what
special relativity tells us.

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:43.510
Another major intellectual
rethinking that had to occur

00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:45.100
has to do with
general relativity.

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:46.090
This was 1916.

00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:48.580
This is Einstein, as
well as the previous one.

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:50.680
This is Newtonian physics
extended to the realm

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:53.690
of the very massive.

00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:56.870
Gravity, it turns out, is
nothing but the bending

00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:58.860
of space and time.

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:00.320
Now, that's weird enough.

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:03.430
I'm not even going to
try to explain that.

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:07.240
Subsequent lectures by Sam
Gralla and Feryal Özel will

00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:08.980
talk about this.

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:10.900
But this is the
foundation of all

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:14.950
of modern cosmology, the Big
Bang, the expanding universe,

00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:18.100
black holes, event
horizons, gravity waves.

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:21.710
It all comes from here.

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:23.610
The quantum revolution
is another one

00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:24.710
I'm sure you've heard of.

00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:27.270
This developed slowly
over many years.

00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:31.460
But it finally reached its
crescendo in the mid-1920s.

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:33.200
This is Newtonian
physics extended

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:35.930
to the realm of the subatomic.

00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:37.850
And the basic idea
is about matter.

00:37:37.850 --> 00:37:39.530
Is it a particle?

00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:41.120
Or is it a wave?

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.770
Sometimes, it behaves
like a particle.

00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:44.990
Sometimes, it behaves
like a wave, when

00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:47.330
you go to the subatomic world.

00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:50.840
In particular, one
weird thing one finds

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:53.570
is that identical
experiments will

00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:56.570
follow the same laws of
physics, but need not

00:37:56.570 --> 00:37:57.747
produce the same outcomes.

00:37:57.747 --> 00:38:00.080
You can have an experiment
here and an experiment there.

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:02.600
They're identical.

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:05.150
And they follow both the
same laws of physics.

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:09.260
And yet, this one says A at
the end, and this one says B.

00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:12.250
In fact, all that can be
predicted, it turns out,

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:13.970
are the probabilities
that you'll

00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:17.390
get A or get B as
the end results.

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:22.630
Absolute determinism was lost
from physics at this moment.

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:24.610
You'll hear more about
this quantum weirdness

00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:27.411
in the lecture by Pierre Meystre
at the end of this lecture

00:38:27.411 --> 00:38:27.910
series.

00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:30.980
But this is what he'll
be talking about.

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:36.310
Another major revolution has to
do with quantum field theory.

00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:39.664
This is quantum mechanics
joined with special relativity.

00:38:39.664 --> 00:38:41.830
And what we learn from here,
through all these kinds

00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:44.500
of weird diagrams that you
often see people draw--

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:48.270
physicists often are playing
with diagrams like that--

00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:50.380
is the discovery of anti-matter.

00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:53.290
For every particle, there's
a corresponding anti-particle

00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:55.360
that it can annihilate with.

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:58.900
And in some sense, this is
finally the dream of alchemy.

00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:00.220
This is modern alchemy.

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:02.510
One particle can be annihilated.

00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:04.990
And a completely different
particle, a different element

00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:07.390
can be created in its place.

00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:10.360
The vacuum, which is just
another word for empty space,

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:12.940
can create
particle/anti-particle pairs

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:14.850
out of nothing.

00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:18.560
This, again, was a
very strange concept.

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:20.760
Now, such revolutions
have continued even

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:24.770
to the present day, causing
a continual rethinking

00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:27.320
of the ultimate
nature of reality.

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:29.607
I could have
continued that story

00:39:29.607 --> 00:39:31.940
with things that happened in
the '70s and '80s and '90s,

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:32.840
and I will.

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:34.970
But I want to put this in
the last part of the talk

00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:37.790
here, because what we're
interested now to understand

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:39.710
is then, well, if
we're continually

00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:43.370
rethinking the ultimate nature
of reality, where are we now?

00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:47.030
In particular, what describes
the reality of the universe

00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:49.310
as we understand it today?

00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:51.770
So now, I want to switch
gears a little bit

00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:54.830
and tell you the
big picture we think

00:39:54.830 --> 00:40:00.320
we have today about the
nature of the physical world.

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:03.260
What are the fundamental things?

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:06.470
Well, when I ask a question
like "what is fundamental?",

00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:07.950
I really am asking
for two things.

00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:10.910
I'm asking for what are the
fundamental particles that

00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:13.940
make up the matter that
everything is made of?

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:16.220
And what are the
fundamental forces

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:20.060
that describe the interactions
between the different particles

00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:21.620
of matter?

00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:23.570
But even the use of
the word "fundamental"

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:26.150
is a bit strange
and time-dependent.

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:29.090
If you think about biology
for a minute, you might say,

00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:32.360
well, the fundamental object
in biology is the cell.

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:34.155
And for a long time,
people thought that.

00:40:34.155 --> 00:40:36.530
But then we came to understand
that maybe the nucleus had

00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:39.260
a very special role to play.

00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:41.570
And maybe within the
nucleus, we discovered DNA

00:40:41.570 --> 00:40:45.160
and began to think that
maybe that was fundamental.

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:49.160
Chemistry, similarly, one
might have thought compounds,

00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:51.860
but then actually molecules
and maybe individual atoms

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:53.870
and the atomic structure.

00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:57.410
For physics, what is the
corresponding analogy?

00:40:57.410 --> 00:41:01.430
What are the different things
that are fundamental to us?

00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:05.780
Well, it turns out that what's
fundamental to a physicist

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:08.720
depends on the energy
scale with which you probe,

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:09.860
with which you look.

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:12.830
If you look with
more energy, you

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:14.780
might see smaller and
smaller distances.

00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:15.470
Why?

00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:17.510
Because in general,
it takes more energy

00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:20.382
to probe smaller and
smaller distances.

00:41:20.382 --> 00:41:22.340
So if you're looking with
more and more energy,

00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:24.680
you might see different
fundamental things.

00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:27.710
So the energy units we're
going to use to tell this story

00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:31.876
are called eV And
this is just a code.

00:41:31.876 --> 00:41:33.750
It stands for something
called electron volt.

00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:35.375
But basically, all
you need to think of

00:41:35.375 --> 00:41:36.830
is that this is
the natural energy

00:41:36.830 --> 00:41:40.010
scale associated with atoms.

00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:41.840
OK.

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:45.010
So the fundamental particles
at different energy scales--

00:41:45.010 --> 00:41:48.890
well, at the eV scale,
the electron volt scale,

00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:52.130
the fundamental
elements are atoms,

00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:55.160
in particular nuclei
plus electrons

00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:57.290
that orbit around them.

00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:59.960
But it turns out, as you know,
that there are different types

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:02.600
of nuclei that exist.

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:05.840
These fill out the different
elements, the periodic table.

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:07.640
And if you go into any
chemistry classroom,

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:09.514
or maybe you remember
from your own chemistry

00:42:09.514 --> 00:42:12.650
experience in your own
high school classroom,

00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:14.180
you saw the periodic table.

00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:17.510
And it was arranged in certain
rows and certain columns,

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:20.660
because there were certain
repeating structures that made

00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:21.950
sense to arrange it this way.

00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:24.200
There was a structure to it.

00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:28.940
That structure, this
repeating pattern

00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:32.300
suggested that there
was a deeper structure.

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:34.610
And indeed, there is one.

00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:38.960
To probe this, we go to higher
energies, megaelectron-volts.

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:42.650
This is a million
times stronger.

00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:46.640
And at this level, we see
that a nucleus is actually

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:49.640
a collection of
protons and neutrons.

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:51.650
And so those
different arrangements

00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:54.400
of protons and neutrons, with
different numbers of protons

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:56.060
and numbers of
neutrons, that's what

00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:59.540
makes the different elements and
fills out the periodic table.

00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:01.010
OK.

00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:03.650
So at the MeV, the
megaelectron-volts scale,

00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:06.050
we would say, well, the
elementary particles

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:09.260
are protons and neutrons,
plus those electrons that

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:10.989
are orbiting.

00:43:10.989 --> 00:43:12.530
And you might think
that for a while,

00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:16.010
but it turns out that there
are many different types

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:18.020
of neutrons and protons.

00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:19.919
These are collectively
called hadrons.

00:43:19.919 --> 00:43:21.710
And you don't just have
proton and neutron,

00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:25.950
but you also have pion and
kaon and rho meson and omega--

00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:27.270
lots of Greek names.

00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:30.530
This was all discovered
around the 1940s, '50s, '60s.

00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:33.830
People were discovering
these like mad, couldn't even

00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:36.680
keep up with the naming scheme.

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:38.610
And people said, well,
once again, there seems

00:43:38.610 --> 00:43:40.890
to be a repeating structure.

00:43:40.890 --> 00:43:43.530
Maybe there's something deeper.

00:43:43.530 --> 00:43:46.830
And we looked with higher
energy machines, colliders

00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:51.690
usually, at the
gigaelectron-volt scale, GeV.

00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:54.460
And we found that inside
each proton were two up

00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:57.480
quarks and a down quark.

00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:02.340
And inside each neutron were
two down quarks and an up quark.

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:04.980
And so now, at the
gigaelectron-volt volt scale,

00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:07.890
the fundamental particles
appear to be quarks,

00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:10.680
plus those electrons again.

00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:14.190
But once again, these
powerful colliders

00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:16.140
found that that wasn't it.

00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:18.150
There were many different
types of quarks,

00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:20.610
not just up and down, but also--

00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:21.960
and we had to give more names.

00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:27.360
So here they come, strange
and charm and bottom and top.

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:28.774
You could feel the desperation.

00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:36.060
Likewise, it turns out that
those electrons also were just

00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:38.130
the beginning of a
series of particles

00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:39.840
that were all very light.

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:42.630
They're called leptons.

00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:45.630
"Lepto" is a Greek prefix.

00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:47.160
It means "light."

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:48.912
And so these are
light particles.

00:44:48.912 --> 00:44:50.370
So there was not
only the electron,

00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:53.070
but a slightly heavier
one called the muon,

00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:55.950
and a slightly heavier version
of that called the tau,

00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:59.220
and then three different
other light particles, which

00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:01.410
are called neutrinos.

00:45:01.410 --> 00:45:05.100
And they're listed here
as neu sub-e, neu sub-mu,

00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:06.270
and neu sub-tau--

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:10.290
electron neutrino, muon
neutrino, and tau neutrino.

00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:13.850
They seem to go with the
other leptons, the electron,

00:45:13.850 --> 00:45:15.127
the muon, and the tau.

00:45:15.127 --> 00:45:16.710
For the remainder
of this talk, I just

00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:18.974
want you to note that
there are three neutrinos,

00:45:18.974 --> 00:45:20.390
and they come in
different tapes--

00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:24.370
electron, muon,
and tau neutrinos.

00:45:24.370 --> 00:45:29.280
So again, you suspect there
must be a deeper structure.

00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:33.330
So of course, you're
dying to know what it is.

00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:37.550
And if we had built the
superconducting supercollider

00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:39.980
that you might
remember that people

00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:44.690
used to talk about building
in Texas, about 20 years ago--

00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:49.700
if that had been built, I
could probably tell you now.

00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:53.630
But it was canceled,
and so we don't know.

00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:56.480
So this is as far as
we've come so far.

00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:58.250
And we wrap up our
knowledge in what

00:45:58.250 --> 00:46:00.460
we call the standard model.

00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:01.610
And the standard model--

00:46:01.610 --> 00:46:04.020
here it is, very simple.

00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:06.950
It consists of the particles
that we just saw, the quarks--

00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:10.340
up, down, strange,
charm, top, bottom--

00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:13.340
and the leptons--
electron and its neutrino,

00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:16.520
muon and its neutrino,
tau and its neutrino.

00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:20.820
These are grouped in packages
of three generations.

00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:22.130
Each row is like a generation.

00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:25.520
And we say that there are
three generations of quarks

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:28.520
and three generations
of leptons.

00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:29.690
That's the particles.

00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:32.270
And along with this
are the forces.

00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:34.850
And there are many forces.

00:46:34.850 --> 00:46:37.040
There are three fundamental
forces, it turns out.

00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:38.775
Three primary forces.

00:46:38.775 --> 00:46:40.400
And they each have
different strengths,

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:43.370
which are listed there,
in relative numbers.

00:46:43.370 --> 00:46:47.210
The strongest one, with a
strength as big as one eighth,

00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:49.340
that's called the strong force.

00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:55.070
Its job is to prevent the
atomic nuclei from exploding

00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:56.550
due to electrostatic repulsion.

00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:57.800
Think about this for a minute.

00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:00.110
You learned in
chemistry, when you

00:47:00.110 --> 00:47:01.880
learned about the
atomic nucleus,

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:04.340
that it's made of
protons and neutrons.

00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:06.770
Well, here's a question you
could have asked your teacher.

00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:09.380
And probably, your teacher
wouldn't have known the answer.

00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:11.070
But here's the question.

00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:13.970
If the neutrons are
electrically neutral,

00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:17.360
and the protons are
all positively charged,

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:19.460
then really you're shoving
all these positively

00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:21.380
charged objects together.

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:24.710
But we know that
like charges repel.

00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:27.560
So this thing would
want to go flying apart.

00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:32.230
What, then, keeps an
atomic nucleus together?

00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:33.700
The answer is that you're right.

00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:38.200
The electromagnetism wants to
make the nucleus fly apart.

00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:41.920
But there's another force,
which is even stronger.

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:45.190
It's this strong force,
which is attractive and holds

00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:46.990
it together.

00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:49.537
Then, there are two other
forces, the weak force

00:47:49.537 --> 00:47:50.620
and the hypercharge force.

00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:52.661
And as you see from the
relative strengths there,

00:47:52.661 --> 00:47:53.650
they're much weaker.

00:47:53.650 --> 00:47:56.500
These two forces
work always together.

00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:59.480
They're very coupled in a
certain mathematical way.

00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:01.414
And the best way to
describe what they do is--

00:48:01.414 --> 00:48:03.580
the best way you know that
they're there, especially

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:05.620
in Arizona here--

00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:07.870
they make the sun shine.

00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:12.040
So we in Arizona owe our
uniqueness to these forces.

00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:15.010
Now, you might say, but
what about electromagnetism?

00:48:15.010 --> 00:48:17.860
None of those forces that I
listed are electromagnetism.

00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:22.630
Well, it turns out that the weak
force and the hypercharge force

00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:25.840
are like blue paint
and yellow paint.

00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:28.960
But if you mix them together,
you get green paint.

00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:31.840
Electromagnetism is
like that green paint.

00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:33.160
It's not a primary color.

00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:34.900
It's not a primary force.

00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:37.750
The primary forces are
weak and hypercharge.

00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:40.060
But they can be mixed
together, and that's

00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:41.230
what electromagnetism is.

00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:44.680
It's just a mixture of these
two more primary forces.

00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:46.810
And the thing that
does the mixing

00:48:46.810 --> 00:48:51.040
is that magic Higgs particle
that you've heard about.

00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:55.270
So if you want, there's
a certain grammar

00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:56.490
to the standard model.

00:48:56.490 --> 00:49:01.030
The particles are the nouns,
the things that get acted on.

00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:05.020
The forces are the verbs, the
things that do the acting.

00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:08.740
And the Higgs modifies those
verbs and how they behave.

00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:11.630
It's an adverb.

00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:15.950
And if you want, you can
imagine the standard model

00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:17.270
as having those three forces.

00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:20.810
And you can imagine
listing them on an axis,

00:49:20.810 --> 00:49:22.242
according to their strengths.

00:49:22.242 --> 00:49:25.790
We'll List the strongest ones at
the bottom and the weakest ones

00:49:25.790 --> 00:49:26.820
at the top.

00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:30.050
So there's the strong at the
bottom and then the other two

00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:31.850
further up.

00:49:31.850 --> 00:49:35.150
Now, you might ask,
is that all there is?

00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:39.020
But there's lots of reasons to
believe in something deeper.

00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:42.536
The standard model has many
parameters you have to put in.

00:49:42.536 --> 00:49:43.910
You have to say,
what is the mass

00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:46.409
of every one of those quarks
and every one of those leptons?

00:49:46.409 --> 00:49:49.010
You just have to measure
the number from data

00:49:49.010 --> 00:49:50.390
and put it into your theory.

00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:53.210
We would have liked to
predict something like that,

00:49:53.210 --> 00:49:55.850
not just measure it from data.

00:49:55.850 --> 00:49:57.860
So that's a bit mysterious.

00:49:57.860 --> 00:49:59.360
There are also
conceptual questions

00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:00.680
in the standard model.

00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:04.730
Why do the particles come in
three generations like that?

00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:07.580
Why are there are
three kinds of forces?

00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:10.281
Why do these forces have
those different strengths?

00:50:10.281 --> 00:50:12.530
Again, you would have hoped
a fundamental theory would

00:50:12.530 --> 00:50:15.800
explain that, but we don't
have that explanation.

00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:19.556
We just measured it, and those
numbers are what they are.

00:50:19.556 --> 00:50:20.930
And that's not
really very pretty

00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:22.388
from a physics
point of view, where

00:50:22.388 --> 00:50:24.765
you want to understand
fundamental reasons for things.

00:50:24.765 --> 00:50:27.140
And then, finally, there is
another force you know about,

00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:29.360
gravity, which we haven't
even mentioned here.

00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:31.430
How do you incorporate
the gravitational force?

00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:34.920
How do you quantize gravity
and put it into this framework?

00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:36.830
So once again, we
think there should

00:50:36.830 --> 00:50:41.470
be-- we suspect that there
is a deeper structure.

00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:44.540
So to go beyond
the standard model,

00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:46.970
we have to build
big accelerators.

00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:50.210
And fortunately, after 20
years of planning and building,

00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:52.040
the next generation
of accelerators

00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:56.740
and colliders and detectors
are yielding data now.

00:50:56.740 --> 00:51:00.770
And what I'm showing
here is an overview

00:51:00.770 --> 00:51:02.880
of the Geneva countryside.

00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:05.420
This is just outside
Geneva, Switzerland.

00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:08.960
In fact, right here behind
me, this white stretch

00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:12.830
here is the runway of
the Geneva airport.

00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:13.910
So you get a scale here.

00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:17.150
These are many different towns.

00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:20.540
Before I came to
the U of A, I worked

00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:23.420
at this European Laboratory for
Particle Physics, which is just

00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:25.460
outside Geneva, Switzerland.

00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:26.960
And you would know
every day, as you

00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:29.420
drove in and out, inside the
ring and outside the ring--

00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:32.480
of course, the ring
here is all underground.

00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:36.950
And we, underground, accelerate
particles and make collisions

00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:38.810
and then look at
the debris and try

00:51:38.810 --> 00:51:43.940
to figure out what the next
level of nature might be.

00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:46.340
I mentioned that when
we do these collisions,

00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:49.430
we have to have detectors to
see the spray of particles

00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:51.770
that come out and measure them.

00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:54.500
And one of the big detectors
is called the ATLAS detector.

00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:56.780
I mention it because
our research group here

00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:59.780
at the U of A was very
instrumental in building

00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:05.300
that ATLAS detector and
effecting its overall design.

00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:08.270
So you'll hear more about
this in the subsequent lecture

00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:09.650
from Elliott Cheu.

00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:11.570
But what kinds of
physics do we expect

00:52:11.570 --> 00:52:15.250
to find at these colliders?

00:52:15.250 --> 00:52:16.990
Well, this is now
speculation, but this

00:52:16.990 --> 00:52:18.490
is what most people believe.

00:52:18.490 --> 00:52:21.220
So this is part of
our big picture.

00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:24.550
One idea is something
called supersymmetry,

00:52:24.550 --> 00:52:25.904
often called SUSY.

00:52:25.904 --> 00:52:27.820
And this is a new kind
of symmetry in physics.

00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:29.278
And basically, what
it says is that

00:52:29.278 --> 00:52:31.180
for every one of the
standard particles

00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:34.510
that you saw before on the
left, the ones that make up

00:52:34.510 --> 00:52:37.660
the standard model, there's a
corresponding supersymmetric

00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:39.650
partner.

00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:42.160
And that's a lot
of new particles.

00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:43.600
But the reason we
imagine this is

00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:46.130
because it would help to
solve a lot of puzzles.

00:52:46.130 --> 00:52:48.280
It would help to explain
the relative strengths

00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:50.050
of the forces, why
the strong force is so

00:52:50.050 --> 00:52:53.310
much stronger than the weak
force, and so forth, like that.

00:52:53.310 --> 00:52:56.860
It would help to explain why the
Higgs particle turns out to be

00:52:56.860 --> 00:52:59.380
much lighter than we expected.

00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:02.490
And it could even possibly
explain dark matter.

00:53:02.490 --> 00:53:06.220
So supersymmetry is
one theory we really

00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:07.870
believe that we will find.

00:53:07.870 --> 00:53:09.640
And we actually
believe that we'll

00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:12.760
find it at an energy
scale just slightly

00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:16.100
higher than the standard model,
just a little bit higher up.

00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:18.760
So this horizontal
axis that I'm building

00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:21.910
is going towards
increasing energy.

00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:23.320
And we believe
that supersymmetry

00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:26.740
will come right beyond
there, just beyond

00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:28.870
or at the reach of
current accelerators.

00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:30.640
Searching for
supersymmetry was actually

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:33.400
one of the primary reasons
the Large Hadron Collider,

00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:38.970
this big circular ring
in Geneva was built.

00:53:38.970 --> 00:53:40.800
The next idea
beyond supersymmetry

00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:44.100
is what we call Grand
Unified Theories, where

00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:48.264
the forces would, at very
high energies, unify into one.

00:53:48.264 --> 00:53:49.680
And at first glance,
it might seem

00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:51.150
that such a
unification of forces

00:53:51.150 --> 00:53:53.340
couldn't possibly
happen, because the three

00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:56.520
fundamental forces had
different strengths.

00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:58.800
But it turns out that
for various reasons,

00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:02.250
as you go upwards in energy,
the strong forces become weaker.

00:54:02.250 --> 00:54:04.200
The weak forces become stronger.

00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:05.640
And they actually do unify.

00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:06.930
It's rather remarkable.

00:54:06.930 --> 00:54:11.400
So this number, 10 to
the 16 of those GeVs,

00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:13.590
gigaelectron-volts, this
would be the natural energy

00:54:13.590 --> 00:54:15.990
scale for grand unification.

00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:19.200
Finally, at the very
highest energy scales,

00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:22.250
physicists think the world
is governed by string theory.

00:54:22.250 --> 00:54:24.300
Now, what's string theory?

00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:25.770
This is a complicated subject.

00:54:25.770 --> 00:54:26.850
I can barely tell you.

00:54:26.850 --> 00:54:28.683
But let me give you a
cartoon, which I think

00:54:28.683 --> 00:54:31.110
captures the essence.

00:54:31.110 --> 00:54:32.610
The basic idea is
that if you looked

00:54:32.610 --> 00:54:34.860
at an elementary particle,
like an electron,

00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:37.590
under some really
powerful microscope,

00:54:37.590 --> 00:54:39.780
you would find that what
it really consists of

00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:42.900
is a vibrating loop of
energy, not a point-particle,

00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:44.030
but a loop.

00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:46.320
It would have structure.

00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:49.140
And all particles
and forces in nature

00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:51.270
would then be
unified, because they

00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:56.370
would be different excitations
of that fundamental loop.

00:54:56.370 --> 00:54:58.770
And higher and higher
vibrational modes

00:54:58.770 --> 00:55:03.150
would correspond to the quarks
or the leptons or the forces

00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:05.196
that we know or even gravity.

00:55:05.196 --> 00:55:06.570
So therefore,
everything would be

00:55:06.570 --> 00:55:09.630
unified as different excitations
of one fundamental entity,

00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:11.820
which is the string.

00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:14.190
So string theory sits at
the highest possible energy

00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:16.012
scale you can consider.

00:55:16.012 --> 00:55:17.970
And it's the hope that
string theory would then

00:55:17.970 --> 00:55:20.250
provide theoretical
guidance concerning

00:55:20.250 --> 00:55:22.740
the many possible extensions
to the standard model that

00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:26.400
would fill this desert, as we
move upwards in energy scale

00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:29.430
from what's down there
on the left, where

00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:32.100
current accelerators
can reach, and what's

00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:35.460
up here on the right, which
are the fundamental scales

00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:35.970
of physics.

00:55:35.970 --> 00:55:40.020
This desert is mysterious to
us, and maybe string theory

00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:43.180
could give us some
information about that.

00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:46.860
So this was the picture that
we carried in our heads,

00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:48.270
certainly until the 1990s.

00:55:48.270 --> 00:55:50.130
When I went to grad
school, this is where

00:55:50.130 --> 00:55:52.320
I would have ended a talk.

00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:55.680
But in the last 20
years, again, we've

00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:57.840
had to do some rethinking.

00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:00.270
So let me conclude this
talk by telling you

00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:03.060
the four things that
have changed this picture

00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:05.580
and what we now think
the new picture is.

00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:08.850
So the first big result,
in the late '90s,

00:56:08.850 --> 00:56:10.880
were those neutrinos.

00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:12.630
It turned out, when I
went to grad school,

00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:14.880
we were told that
neutrinos were massless.

00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:15.570
No more.

00:56:15.570 --> 00:56:19.370
We now know they have
very, very tiny masses.

00:56:19.370 --> 00:56:21.650
Thus, it turns out,
neutrinos can do something

00:56:21.650 --> 00:56:23.690
no other particle can do.

00:56:23.690 --> 00:56:25.580
They can change their
identities as they

00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:27.620
fly through space,
without interacting

00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:28.970
with any other particle.

00:56:28.970 --> 00:56:31.470
And remember I told you there
were three kinds of neutrinos?

00:56:31.470 --> 00:56:33.320
An electron neutrino
can be flying along,

00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:37.220
and it says, hey, I'd like
to be a muon neutrino now.

00:56:37.220 --> 00:56:39.860
Oh, I want to change to tau.

00:56:39.860 --> 00:56:41.960
Oh, I want to be an
electron neutrino again.

00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:45.920
And they can oscillate
like this through space.

00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:46.750
That's weird.

00:56:46.750 --> 00:56:48.510
No other particle can do that.

00:56:48.510 --> 00:56:50.930
Another big
discovery, of course,

00:56:50.930 --> 00:56:53.420
was the discovery
of the Higgs boson.

00:56:53.420 --> 00:56:56.750
For the first time, this allows
us to study important phase

00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:58.640
transitions in the
standard model,

00:56:58.640 --> 00:56:59.807
like water melting into ice.

00:56:59.807 --> 00:57:01.556
There are other kinds
of phase transitions

00:57:01.556 --> 00:57:02.570
in the standard model.

00:57:02.570 --> 00:57:05.660
And this enables us to
probe for the first time

00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:08.860
the underlying ground state.

00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:12.850
Now, those are two things that
were about the standard model.

00:57:12.850 --> 00:57:15.989
But it turns out, even
more mysteriously,

00:57:15.989 --> 00:57:17.530
that over the past
two decades, we've

00:57:17.530 --> 00:57:20.200
learned that the standard
model itself does not

00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:22.600
describe the entire
reality of the universe.

00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:25.420
Even more exists out there.

00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:28.720
In particular, there's been
a dawning realization--

00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:31.840
it was not a sharp discovery,
but a dawning realization,

00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:34.330
with more and more evidence
accumulating, that there is

00:57:34.330 --> 00:57:35.650
something called dark matter.

00:57:35.650 --> 00:57:37.870
Now, first of all, I want
to emphasize right away,

00:57:37.870 --> 00:57:40.660
dark matter is a bad
name, because it's not

00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:43.930
really dark, like a black
hole sucking in all light,

00:57:43.930 --> 00:57:46.120
but rather transparent,
in the sense

00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:48.940
that everything we know
moves through it invisibly.

00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:51.790
We know it's there, because
we can feel it gravitationally

00:57:51.790 --> 00:57:53.860
through its
gravitational effects

00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:55.390
on other objects
in the universe.

00:57:55.390 --> 00:57:57.640
But we have no idea
what it's made of.

00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:00.040
We don't even know if
it interacts with itself

00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:02.761
or whether it goes through
itself transparently.

00:58:02.761 --> 00:58:03.760
We don't even know that.

00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:05.350
It's a complete mystery.

00:58:05.350 --> 00:58:08.800
Yet, it turns out that this
dark matter, whatever it is,

00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:14.470
is almost 26% of the entire
energy of the universe.

00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:17.950
Here, I've shown what's
called the Bullet Cluster.

00:58:17.950 --> 00:58:21.430
The red regions are regions that
are high in ordinary matter,

00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:23.380
very dense ordinary matter.

00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:26.620
The blue regions-- and we've
just colored them blue,

00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:29.140
because dark matter
is transparent.

00:58:29.140 --> 00:58:32.620
But by gravitational
sensing, we know

00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:35.450
that this is where we
believe the dark matter is.

00:58:35.450 --> 00:58:38.860
And you see it sits there
right alongside but separated

00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:40.330
from ordinary matter.

00:58:40.330 --> 00:58:42.710
It's a real object.

00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:43.960
OK.

00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:46.870
The other most
incredible discovery--

00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:51.175
this happened in 1998, and
this was a complete surprise--

00:58:51.175 --> 00:58:53.050
is that unlike dark
matter, there's something

00:58:53.050 --> 00:58:54.970
called dark energy.

00:58:54.970 --> 00:58:57.700
Unlike dark matter, this
permeates all of space

00:58:57.700 --> 00:59:00.310
and acts like an
antigravity, in the sense

00:59:00.310 --> 00:59:04.660
that it causes space itself to
expand more and more rapidly.

00:59:04.660 --> 00:59:07.810
Because of the dark
energy, it's now

00:59:07.810 --> 00:59:11.110
believed that the universe
will expand forever,

00:59:11.110 --> 00:59:14.910
with an ever increasing
speed, faster and faster,

00:59:14.910 --> 00:59:17.280
rather than approach
a stable final size

00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:20.220
or shrink back down
into a final crunch.

00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:22.860
We didn't know what the
universe might do eventually.

00:59:22.860 --> 00:59:26.900
But now, because of this dark
energy, we think we know.

00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:29.400
But what physics makes
up this dark energy?

00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:31.380
We have no idea whatsoever.

00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:33.630
Your guess is as good as mine.

00:59:33.630 --> 00:59:36.810
Even worse, the dark
energy comprises--

00:59:36.810 --> 00:59:37.440
a little bit?

00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:38.260
No.

00:59:38.260 --> 00:59:42.690
70% of the total
energy of the universe.

00:59:42.690 --> 00:59:47.160
So the final big picture
I want to leave you with

00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:48.030
is this pie chart.

00:59:48.030 --> 00:59:51.150
We call this the cosmic pie.

00:59:51.150 --> 00:59:53.490
This is the total energy
distribution of the universe.

00:59:53.490 --> 00:59:56.289
That yellow slice
is normal matter.

00:59:56.289 --> 00:59:58.080
That's the standard
model I told you about.

00:59:58.080 --> 00:59:59.700
That's everything
we know, planets,

00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:03.120
stars, the entire visible
universe, you, me, Tucson.

01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:05.310
We all reside in
that little slice.

01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:08.729
The dark matter is
that purple 26%.

01:00:08.729 --> 01:00:10.020
It's not in the standard model.

01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:11.436
It's currently a
complete mystery.

01:00:11.436 --> 01:00:15.120
And then dark energy,
we have no idea at all.

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:17.070
And that's 69%.

01:00:17.070 --> 01:00:19.260
Boy, this is a
rethinking if ever there

01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:23.640
was one, when we thought
that 5% was everything.

01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:27.480
So I hate to do this
to you, but what

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:31.710
that means is that this talk
ends only with mysteries.

01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:33.780
And that's the
nature of science.

01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:36.840
Answering one set of
questions only poses more.

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:38.460
But these are really
exciting times

01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:41.520
to be a physicist, as you'll see
from the subsequent lectures,

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:44.910
because we're all constantly
rethinking the rules of reality

01:00:44.910 --> 01:00:47.700
and probing the most fundamental
questions about the composition

01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:50.640
of the universe and
the laws that it obeys.

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:53.940
So I urge you to stay tuned
to scientific developments

01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:55.210
as they occur.

01:00:55.210 --> 01:00:57.390
And most importantly, I'd
like to see you at next

01:00:57.390 --> 01:01:00.880
week's lecture, when my
colleague, Feryal Özel,

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:03.401
will take you to the extreme
limits of our physical

01:01:03.401 --> 01:01:03.900
universe.

01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:05.730
So thank you very much.

01:01:05.730 --> 01:01:08.780
[APPLAUSE]
