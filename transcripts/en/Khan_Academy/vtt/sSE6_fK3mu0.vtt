00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.710
Let's prove with the derivative
of e to the x's, and I think

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.400
that this is one of the most
amazing things, depending on

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.060
how you view it about either
calculus or math

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.705
or the universe.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.470
Well we're essentially going to
prove-- I've already told you

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.235
before that the derivative of e
to the x is equal to e to

00:00:23.235 --> 00:00:24.600
the x, which is amazing.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.660
The slope at any point of that
line is equal to the x value--

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.050
is equal to the function at
that point, not the x value.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.010
The slope at any
point is equal to e.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.980
That is mind boggling.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.220
And that also means that the
second derivative at any point

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.110
is equal to the function of
that value or the third

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.520
derivative, or the infinite
derivative, and that never

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.380
ceases to amaze me.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.300
But anyway back to work.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.220
So how are we going
to prove this?

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.410
Well we already proved-- I
actually just did it right

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.630
before starting this video--
that the derivative-- and some

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.770
people actually call this
the definition of e.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:00.610
They go the other way around.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.520
They say there is some number
for which this is true,

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.140
and we call that number e.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.310
So it could almost be viewed as
a little bit circular, but be

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.770
we said that e is equal to the
limit as n approaches infinity

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.140
of 1 over 1 plus n to the end.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.930
And then using this we actually
proved that derivative of

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.710
ln of x is equal to 1/x.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.630
The derivative of log base
e of x is equal to 1/x.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.060
So now that we prove this out,
let's use this to prove this.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.290
Let me keep switching colors
to keep it interesting.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.820
Let's take the derivative
of ln of e to the x.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.420
This is almost trivial.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.010
This is equal to the logarithm
of a to the b is equal to b

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.200
times the logarithm of a,
so this is equal to the

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.600
derivative of x ln of e.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.640
And this is just saying e to
what power is equal to e.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.650
Well, to the first
power, right?

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:13.730
So this just equals the
derivative of x, which we

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:14.840
have shown as equal to 1.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.480
I think we have shown it,
hopefully we've shown it.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.650
If we haven't, that's actually
a very easy one to prove.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:21.700
OK fair enough.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.630
We did that.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.030
But let's do this another way.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.280
Let's use the chain rule.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.420
So what doe the chain rule say?

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.610
If we have f of g of x, where
we have one function embedded

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.660
in another one, the chain rule
say we take the derivative of

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:50.550
the inside function, so
d/dx of e to the x.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.320
And then we take the derivative
of the outside function or the

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.340
derivative of the outside
function with respect

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.400
to the inner function.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.570
You can almost
view it that way.

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.000
So the derivative ln
of e to the x with

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.530
respect to e to the x.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:05.530
I know that's a
little confusing.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.680
You could have written a d e to
the x down over here, but I

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.760
think you know the
chain rule by now.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.650
That is equal to 1
over e to the x.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.055
And that just comes from this.

00:03:18.055 --> 00:03:19.940
But instead of an x,
we have e to the x.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.340
So this is just a chain rule.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.830
Well what else do we know?

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.090
We know that this is equal to
this, and we also know that

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.840
this is equal to this.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.910
So this must be equal to this.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.740
So this must be equal to 1.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.150
Well let's just multiply
both sides of this

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.160
equation by e to the x.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.070
We get on the left hand
side, we're just left

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.246
with this expression.

00:03:44.246 --> 00:03:51.450
The derivative of e to the x
times- we're multiplying both

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.090
sides by e to the x, times
e to the x over e to the x.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.650
I just chose to put the e
to the x on this term,

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.740
is equal to e to the x.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.320
This is 1.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.670
Scratch it out.

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:03.960
We're done.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.890
That might not have been
completely satisfying

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.640
for you, but it works.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.910
The derivative of e to the
x is equal to e to the x.

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:21.260
I think the school or the
nation should take a national

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.250
holiday or something,
and people should just

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.620
ponder this, because it
really is fascinating.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.730
But then actually this will
lead us to I would say even

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.200
more dramatic results in the
not too far off future.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.870
Anyway, I'll see in
the next video.
