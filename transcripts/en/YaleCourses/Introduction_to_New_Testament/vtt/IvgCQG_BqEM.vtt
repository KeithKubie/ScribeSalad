1
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:06.440
The chronological and geographical structure of Luke acts is thematic and

2
00:00:09.811 --> 00:00:14.160
theological,
not historical.
That's what we talked about last time.

3
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.850
How that you can actually see the author of Luke acts taking sources that he

4
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.680
took him before him,
perhaps some oral sources.

5
00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:27.681
I've argued that some of these were even written sources because it seems like

6
00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:31.410
you can actually see where he takes something that was on a written account of

7
00:00:31.411 --> 00:00:33.390
the spread of Christianity slices.

8
00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:36.120
It at one place separates that and put several,

9
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.030
put several chapters in acts between them,
between them.

10
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.480
We also had very clear from the nine the 10 chapters in the gospel of Luke,

11
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.730
which we call the journey to Jerusalem section,

12
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.150
that this is an artificial construction on the author's part because he he,

13
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.620
he tells us at one point at this point,

14
00:00:55.621 --> 00:01:00.621
Jesus set his face to go to Jerusalem and then he's taken material that he's

15
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.540
found in the gospel of mark in different places.
Some parables.

16
00:01:03.541 --> 00:01:05.640
Here's some stories.
Here are some teachings here.

17
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.150
He's taken other things that he probably found in Q in different places.

18
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.740
Although,
because remember we don't possess an actual written document of queue.

19
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.240
It's a hypothetical document,
but we can we,

20
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.900
we figured that if he did this with mark who's document we do possess and

21
00:01:21.901 --> 00:01:25.110
therefore can see how he changes the order of material he presents from mark.

22
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.450
He probably did the same thing with Q also.

23
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.610
So we can see that he's taken things from different sources that he had and put

24
00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:36.210
them into this 10 long 10 chapter long journey to Jerusalem.

25
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.580
So Luke and acts looks like a historical document and this is what fools people

26
00:01:41.581 --> 00:01:45.240
do you remember back earlier in the beginning of the semester where we compared

27
00:01:45.241 --> 00:01:49.530
the first two chapters of Paul's letter to the Galatians with the way Paul is

28
00:01:49.531 --> 00:01:53.280
presented as being in and out of Jerusalem and how many times you went to

29
00:01:53.281 --> 00:01:56.190
Jerusalem,
what happened in Jerusalem,
what happened to Damascus?

30
00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.270
And I ask you to compare those two accounts and some of you thought,

31
00:02:00.271 --> 00:02:04.650
well I believe the ax account because Paul clearly has an ax to grind in

32
00:02:04.651 --> 00:02:05.191
Galatians.

33
00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:08.550
He's clearly trying to make a point of his independence from the Jerusalem

34
00:02:08.551 --> 00:02:12.330
church.
And the book of acts just looks more like a history.

35
00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:16.080
It looks more like a historical account.
Well by now you know that yes,

36
00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:18.150
even though it looks like a historical account,

37
00:02:18.151 --> 00:02:21.360
especially by ancient a historiographical standards,

38
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.230
it's not a historical account in anything like the modern sense.

39
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.340
So one of those important things to realize,
these texts you're reading,

40
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.540
our creative texts,
they're put together for purposes,

41
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.280
not one of them is coming to you without some kind of ax to grind without some

42
00:02:38.281 --> 00:02:42.960
kind of tendency without some kind of theological or ethical or political

43
00:02:42.961 --> 00:02:47.880
statement to make.
I would go further as the,
well,

44
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.530
I just think I'm an honest realist.

45
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.820
Some people might call me a cynic and say that we need to be careful about all

46
00:02:53.821 --> 00:02:58.821
texts we read and not take any texts that we read as not having some kind of

47
00:02:59.261 --> 00:03:04.210
slant,
some kind of interest,
sometimes some kind of ideological a message.

48
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.370
So that's important to read about all techs in my view.

49
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.370
So the last time I made this point by pointing out how that we can see some

50
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.600
seams in Luke's narrative where he ripped apart the source.

51
00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:21.601
He used to splice something between x eight four and annex 1119 now I want you

52
00:03:22.451 --> 00:03:24.170
to look with me at another passage in acts.

53
00:03:24.171 --> 00:03:29.171
We're going to do the same sort of thing with x six and seven so get your bibles

54
00:03:29.231 --> 00:03:33.730
out.
This is the story of Stephen.

55
00:03:33.731 --> 00:03:35.830
We've talked about Steven's several times already.

56
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.950
He's supposedly the first Christian martyr.

57
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.840
He was one of the Greek speaking Hellenistic Jews whose in Jerusalem at the time

58
00:03:43.841 --> 00:03:45.610
after Jesus's death and resurrection,

59
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.740
and he's chosen as one of the 12 deacons to minister to the widows and to do

60
00:03:50.741 --> 00:03:52.210
other kinds of ministerial work.

61
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.960
Probably because the church was made up partly of Aramaic,

62
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.110
Hebrew speaking Jews and partly of Greek speaking Jews.

63
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.890
Steven seems to have been one of those who has chosen to kind of take care of

64
00:04:02.891 --> 00:04:06.970
the Greek speaking Jewish members of this small little community.

65
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.240
Now you have to remember we're talking a very early period in the history of

66
00:04:10.241 --> 00:04:12.490
Christianity.
It's not even Christianity yet.

67
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.700
This is just a bunch of Jews who believe Jesus is the Messiah.

68
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.530
They were shocked and horrified when Jesus was crucified because the Messiah was

69
00:04:20.531 --> 00:04:21.760
not supposed to be crucified.

70
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.200
There was no Jewish expectation to the Messiah would be a suffering Messiah in

71
00:04:26.201 --> 00:04:29.740
the ancient Jewish world.
That's something that followers of Jesus had to invent.

72
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.040
Once they were shocked at the fact that he was actually crucified,

73
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.640
they idea was the Messiah wouldn't be crucified,
wouldn't suffer,
the Messiah,

74
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.010
would bring an army and overthrow the Romans.

75
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.970
So the fact that they believed he was the messiah and then he's executed,

76
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.260
that just came as a huge shock to these early disciples of Jesus and they

77
00:04:47.261 --> 00:04:51.940
basically had to invent a new concept of what the Jewish Messiah was.

78
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.230
These was a very small group of people huddled in Jerusalem.

79
00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.010
Maybe some of them were in Galilee,
maybe in Syria,
maybe if you're the places,

80
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.300
but according to acts,

81
00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:05.230
they're all in Jerusalem at this time and this small group of people are trying

82
00:05:05.231 --> 00:05:08.890
to figure out who Jesus was and what's that means for the history of of

83
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.480
Jerusalem.
Stephen is one of these people and he's accused of several things.

84
00:05:13.481 --> 00:05:16.540
Look at six 11 chapter six verse 11 in acts.

85
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.140
They secretly instigated some men.
That is they,

86
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.400
that the Jewish opponents of this Jesus group,
they had,
uh,

87
00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.410
been become offended with Steven and his arguments.

88
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.350
They secretly instigated some men to say,

89
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.150
we have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.

90
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.990
So they're accusing him of blaspheming against Moses and God.

91
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:43.990
What would this kind of blast mutans Moses and God mean?
What?

92
00:05:43.991 --> 00:05:46.360
We're going to pick up a few details.
Look at 13,

93
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.940
they set up false witnesses who said this man never stopped saying things

94
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.630
against this holy place.
What is this?
Holy Place,

95
00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:01.070
the temple.
Exactly.
This holy place refers to the Jerusalem temple.

96
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.820
So they're accusing him of preaching against the temple and he says,

97
00:06:04.821 --> 00:06:08.330
and the law for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth,

98
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:13.570
we'll destroy this place and we'll change the customs that Moses handed onto us.

99
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.480
Now notice the writer here is telling you this,
cs,

100
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.030
these are false accusations.

101
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:22.910
Are they false accusations?

102
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.170
Was He really preaching against the temple?

103
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:32.150
Remember Jesus is portrayed in some of the gospels as himself,

104
00:06:32.151 --> 00:06:34.100
having predicted that the temple would be destroyed.

105
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.300
Does that mean that Jesus was preaching against the temple?

106
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:44.270
And some Christian writers very quickly portrayed Jesus as teaching that his

107
00:06:44.271 --> 00:06:46.850
followers don't have to keep the Jewish law.

108
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:49.820
I don't think that's actually correct for the historical Jesus as we'll talk

109
00:06:49.821 --> 00:06:51.200
about when we get to the historical Jesus.

110
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.260
But that's clearly a how some early Christian writers are portraying Jesus as

111
00:06:54.261 --> 00:06:58.550
teaching that you,
Chris,
you followers of mine don't have to keep the Jewish law.

112
00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:00.530
That's what they're accusing Steven of doing.

113
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.150
So is this a false accusation or is this just maybe what Stephen actually was

114
00:07:05.151 --> 00:07:09.530
teaching as being a different form of this,
of the message about Jesus?

115
00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:14.660
Notice then we would get to,
these are the accusations about,
uh,
the,
about Steven,

116
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.950
but then in chapter seven,
we get Steven's own speech.
Now,

117
00:07:18.951 --> 00:07:20.000
this is very interesting.

118
00:07:20.001 --> 00:07:23.600
I wish I could read the whole thing because it's rhetorically very powerful.

119
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.260
What Steven does is he starts off just talking about,
um,

120
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.470
the God who appeared to Abraham and Mesopotamia.

121
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:34.820
He tells the story that any of us Christians would recognize as the story of the

122
00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:39.821
Old Testament God and his interactions with Abraham and Moses and which Jews

123
00:07:39.921 --> 00:07:42.980
would recognize as Rick folk did in Jewish scripture and Jewish tradition.

124
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:46.700
And that's the way the most part of the first half of that chapter seven goes.

125
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:51.140
It's a retelling of the Hebrew Bible story about God,

126
00:07:51.141 --> 00:07:54.860
the God of Israel.
What really becomes interesting is though,

127
00:07:54.861 --> 00:07:58.490
when it gets to a around verse 37 in Chapter Seven,

128
00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:03.170
so I mean 35 in chapter seven so look at that with me now,
right before this,

129
00:08:03.171 --> 00:08:06.050
notice this is,
I have surely seen the mistreatment of my people.

130
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:09.320
This is God talking who are in Egypt and have heard their groaning and I have

131
00:08:09.321 --> 00:08:12.770
come down to rescue them.
Come now I will send you to Egypt.

132
00:08:12.771 --> 00:08:15.380
So God is telling Moses at this point he's going to send him to Egypt to deliver

133
00:08:15.381 --> 00:08:19.100
the people.
And we expect the whole story then of the exodus to come next.

134
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:24.280
But what does it say in verse 35 it was this Moses whom they rejected when they

135
00:08:24.711 --> 00:08:25.250
said,

136
00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:30.250
who made you ruler and judge and whom God now sent as both ruler and liberated

137
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:34.010
through the angel who appeared to him in the bush.
In other words,

138
00:08:34.011 --> 00:08:35.510
instead of emphasizing here,

139
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:39.950
Moses activity of leading the Israelites out of captivity,

140
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:43.850
he emphasizes another aspect of the story that's there in the Old Testament

141
00:08:43.851 --> 00:08:44.900
story because yes,

142
00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:48.110
one of the Israelites and you know the story is Moses comes upon to Israelites

143
00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:51.830
who are fighting their both their slaves in Egypt this time and he says to one

144
00:08:51.831 --> 00:08:56.050
of the Israelites,
is that any way to treat your brother?
And that is

145
00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:59.250
like rebukes him and says,
who set you up as a judge over us?

146
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:04.980
Notice that's the verse that Steven's centers on at this point to emphasize the

147
00:09:04.981 --> 00:09:08.070
story about Moses.
Not so much Moses is just deliver,

148
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:12.120
but Moses as someone rejected by the people.

149
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.690
Have we seen that before?
Uh Huh.

150
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:19.260
One of the themes of Luke acts is profits get rejected by the people.

151
00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:23.340
So there,
verse 35,
that's what he just has this,
let's just keep reading there.

152
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:27.360
He led them out having performed wonders and signs in Egypt,
the Red Sea,

153
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:31.860
and in the wilderness for 40 years.
This is the Moses who said to the Israelites,

154
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:36.540
God will raise up a prophet for you from your own people as he raised me up.

155
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:38.280
Now in the Old Testament,

156
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:42.840
it seems like Moses is talking about anybody know

157
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:48.440
who follows Moses as the leader of the people of Israel.
Yes,
sir.

158
00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:50.240
Joshua.
Exactly.

159
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:54.980
So it sounds like Moses predicting Joshua's being raised up,
uh,

160
00:09:54.981 --> 00:09:57.620
after he dies,
but that's not what Stephen thinks.

161
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.433
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

162
00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:04.460
<v 0>Uh,
this is the mosaic.
God will raise your private [inaudible].</v>

163
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.290
He is the one who will,

164
00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:09.680
who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him at

165
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:13.550
Mount Sinai with our ancestors.
He received living oracles to give to us.

166
00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:17.000
Our ancestors were unwilling to obey him.
Instead,

167
00:10:17.001 --> 00:10:19.700
they pushed him aside in their hearts and turned back to Egypt.

168
00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:23.690
And then it tells about,
uh,
the,
the golden calf story,

169
00:10:23.691 --> 00:10:28.040
how the Israelites rejected Moses and the law and made a golden calf toric.

170
00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:29.750
Now look at seven 44,

171
00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:35.660
our ancestors had the tent of testimony in the Wilderness as God directly when

172
00:10:35.661 --> 00:10:38.840
he spoke to Moses,
ordering him to make it according to the pattern he had seen.

173
00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:42.290
This refers to the stories and excess about the tabernacle,

174
00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:47.330
the tent of testimony.
Um,
this is a big tent that's taught the construction,

175
00:10:47.331 --> 00:10:50.090
which has talked about this is where God would meet the people,

176
00:10:50.091 --> 00:10:53.060
Israel and Moses before the building of the temple.

177
00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.340
So Steven is fine with us.

178
00:10:55.341 --> 00:11:00.341
He's saying God constructed Moses and Moses directed the people to construct

179
00:11:00.741 --> 00:11:04.100
this tent of witness or meeting of,
of God with Israel.

180
00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:08.720
And that's where God chose to be with his people according to the Bible.

181
00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.960
So he's that he gives that little history,
but then look at 45,

182
00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:17.740
our ancestors in turn brought it in with just some Joshua when they dispossessed

183
00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:20.660
the nations that God drove out before our ancestors.

184
00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:24.740
And it was there until the time of David.
So up until the time of David,

185
00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:27.800
the people of Israel had a tabernacle that where they met God,

186
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:31.700
who found favor with God and asked what he might,

187
00:11:31.701 --> 00:11:34.220
that he might find a dwelling place for the House of Jacob.

188
00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:39.500
So David was the first one who raised the idea of having a temple to God,

189
00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:41.120
not just the Tabernacle but the temple.

190
00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:42.410
That's where we're going in the history here.

191
00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:45.290
But it was Solomon who built the house for him.

192
00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:50.750
Yet the most high God does not dwell in health is made with human hands.

193
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:55.750
Where does the story go?
The store has gone fine up to this point.

194
00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:00.130
It's just like we see it in exodus and the Old Testament,
the Hebrew Bible,

195
00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:04.090
Solomon.
David wanted to build a temple for God.
God said,
no.

196
00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.390
Solomon comes up later and he wants to build a temple and finally God says yes,

197
00:12:07.391 --> 00:12:10.000
at least according to part of the Hebrew Bible,

198
00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:14.200
but another part of the Hebrew Bible always had a little bit of a prejudice

199
00:12:14.201 --> 00:12:17.650
against the idea that anybody could build a house for God.

200
00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:22.060
Some profits seemed not to like the temple.
So much.

201
00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:26.290
Other profits seem to like the temple.
So much what Steven is doing,

202
00:12:26.291 --> 00:12:28.270
he's pulling out of the Hebrew Bible,

203
00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:33.660
that kind of anti temple prophetic strain and he's emphasizing that as part of

204
00:12:35.051 --> 00:12:38.000
his message.
Then notice what he quotes there and uh,

205
00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.100
patches from the Hebrew Bible.

206
00:12:39.101 --> 00:12:44.101
And then in verse 51 you stiff neck people uncircumcised of heart and ears.

207
00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:52.870
You are forever opposing the Holy Spirit,
just as your ancestors used to do.

208
00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:57.610
What happened to Steven?
He just went,
he,

209
00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:02.050
all of a sudden his panties are really in a wad for no obvious reason.

210
00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.380
He's been telling them the story of the building of the temple.

211
00:13:05.381 --> 00:13:09.160
He's been going along fine now he starts and he's gone from preaching now too.

212
00:13:09.161 --> 00:13:13.180
Insulting his audience.
He's insulting the Jews and Jerusalem.

213
00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.450
He's accusing them of being on the wrong side of history.
Why?

214
00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:17.980
Because they wanted to build a temple.

215
00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:23.930
Which of the prophets did your ancestors not persecute?
They killed those who,

216
00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:27.390
who foretold the coming of the righteous one and now you have it become his

217
00:13:27.391 --> 00:13:28.500
betrayers and murderers.

218
00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:32.940
You are the ones who receive the law as our Dang bite angels.
What

219
00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:37.070
angels gave the Jewish law?

220
00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:43.400
I thought God gave the law the Torah on Sinai.

221
00:13:43.401 --> 00:13:45.130
I thought God wrote this,

222
00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:49.190
the stones with his finger and gave them to Moses and Moses carried him down the

223
00:13:49.191 --> 00:13:53.000
mountain.
Well,
yeah,
that's what scripture says,

224
00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:55.820
but by this time and Jewish history,

225
00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:58.580
it was not uncommon for Jews,

226
00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:03.610
even pious Jews to believe that God did not himself directly right the law and

227
00:14:05.001 --> 00:14:06.920
give it to Moses angels.

228
00:14:06.921 --> 00:14:11.450
Did most of them believe that this was with God's pleasure.
In principle,

229
00:14:11.451 --> 00:14:13.820
God wanted the angels to deliver the law to the Jews,

230
00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:18.320
but at least they put between God and Moses.

231
00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:22.820
Angels and angels according to some of these traditions were the ones who

232
00:14:22.821 --> 00:14:27.350
actually gave the law to the Israelites and to Moses as we'll come to see.

233
00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:32.390
Paul believed this also,
it wasn't an uncommon view among Jews,

234
00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:36.590
but notice what Steven does.
He actually uses this tradition

235
00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:43.210
that the angels were the ones who gave the law to Moses to distance God a bit

236
00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:48.860
from the law to make the law a little bit less connected to God.

237
00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:54.380
He demotes the by reading the angels in between there.

238
00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:58.130
So notice he's done.
Steven has done two things in this speech.

239
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.750
He's grabbed hold of a certain prophetic tradition that we know is already there

240
00:15:02.751 --> 00:15:06.710
in the Bible,
which criticized the Jerusalem temple.

241
00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:12.020
It's there in some profits.
Why should God need a house?
God doesn't need a house.

242
00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:13.280
God is everywhere.

243
00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:17.900
So Steven pulls on that tradition that's already in the Bible and then he adds

244
00:15:17.901 --> 00:15:21.230
this tradition about that was common at the time about Moses being the ones who

245
00:15:21.231 --> 00:15:22.100
actually gave the law.

246
00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:25.040
I mean the angels being the ones who actually gave the law to Moses rather than

247
00:15:25.041 --> 00:15:29.330
God directly.
And then he turns all this on his Jewish attackers,

248
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.990
his critics,
and that's what he accuses them up and then says,

249
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:34.640
you crucified Jesus.

250
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:38.510
Just like the people rejected Moses and all the profits when they heard these

251
00:15:38.511 --> 00:15:42.470
things,
they became enraged and ground their teeth.
At Steven and they stone him.

252
00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:46.790
Is it any surprise they stone him.
Now ask the question again.

253
00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:53.360
When the author of acts sets these things up as false accusations against

254
00:15:53.361 --> 00:15:55.400
Steven,
who's right,

255
00:15:55.700 --> 00:16:00.700
Stephen or the author Stephen actually does look like in his own speech to be

256
00:16:01.611 --> 00:16:04.880
attacking both the law and the temple.

257
00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.900
That is this holy place and Moses,

258
00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:15.230
I think what's going on here is another place we see the author of acts taking

259
00:16:15.231 --> 00:16:20.231
material he has before him and sticking it into a place and then riding around

260
00:16:20.301 --> 00:16:21.740
it.
So for example,

261
00:16:21.741 --> 00:16:25.550
the author of acts is the one who says these were false accusations against

262
00:16:25.551 --> 00:16:28.490
Steven.
They set up and they were totally false.
Steven was totally innocent,

263
00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:32.840
but then he actually includes Steven speech,
which backs up the accusations.

264
00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:38.420
The other thing that makes this seem to me clearly that the author is using

265
00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.480
prior material is that this,

266
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:44.990
this view of the temple that Steven presents this view that the temple is not

267
00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:45.441
good,

268
00:16:45.441 --> 00:16:49.100
that God doesn't like the temple and it's only stiff neck and uncircumcised of

269
00:16:49.101 --> 00:16:51.140
heart.
People who want,
who believe in the temple.

270
00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:55.850
That's not the view of the author of acts.
How do you know that?

271
00:16:56.270 --> 00:17:00.270
Because over and over again,
uh,

272
00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:01.753
Luke,

273
00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:06.080
the author of acts actually portrays the disciples as meeting in the temple

274
00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:07.820
right after the resurrection of Jesus.

275
00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:12.880
Where does it say they met and had prayers and preached and prayed in the

276
00:17:13.791 --> 00:17:18.140
temple?
The disciples of Jesus meet in the temple.
They're not anti temple.

277
00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:23.090
When Paul goes off around the world and then he comes back to Jerusalem,

278
00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:26.630
what does he do to show his piety?
He takes a vow.

279
00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:31.490
The Nazarite vow.
He shaves his head.
He donates money,

280
00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:33.770
which goes to the temple for sacrifices,

281
00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:37.100
and he himself goes to the temple to worship.

282
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.770
Paul worships in the temple,

283
00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:44.570
so the author of acts is not himself anti temple.

284
00:17:44.571 --> 00:17:47.540
He believes that the Jerusalem temple is just fine for Jews.

285
00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:50.940
He actually doesn't think gentiles need to pay that much attention to it,

286
00:17:50.941 --> 00:17:52.710
but he believes it's perfectly fine for Jews.

287
00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:58.370
But he includes in here us a speech by Steven that is both anti temple and

288
00:17:58.861 --> 00:18:00.030
somewhat anti law.

289
00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:05.220
This shows that this author is using these different sources.

290
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:10.550
The speech of Stephen Comes from a pre Lucan source and it set into the book of

291
00:18:12.061 --> 00:18:15.780
acts.
Now that means we can see his editorial activity,

292
00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:17.910
but notice how what it also tells us,
we can see

293
00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.830
we actually have then two different forms of early Christianity.

294
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:24.590
<v 1>Okay.</v>

295
00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:27.710
<v 0>Luke represents one and Steven,</v>

296
00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.530
even embedded within Luke's on document represents another.

297
00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:32.870
We've got two different ideas.

298
00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:37.660
Is the law of Moses something that's given by angels in that Ford demoted and
up,

299
00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:42.170
therefore not very good in which the law of Moses gets criticized or is the law

300
00:18:42.171 --> 00:18:43.460
of Moses perfectly fine,

301
00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:48.940
the Jewish law with the that that signals their ethnicity as being people of

302
00:18:49.401 --> 00:18:51.560
Israel?
That's the point of view of Luke.

303
00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:54.650
Is the temple something that is good.

304
00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:57.800
That's a sign of of God's covenant with Israel,

305
00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:02.480
which seems to be the view of most of the people in Luke acts or is the temple

306
00:19:02.481 --> 00:19:06.140
something that shows that you're stiff necked if you believe in its efficacy?

307
00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:08.510
That seems to be Steven's view.
In other words,

308
00:19:08.511 --> 00:19:11.600
we have little hints here that even within one book in the New Testament,

309
00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:16.690
we have different kinds of early Christianity represented with slightly

310
00:19:16.761 --> 00:19:17.780
different theologies.

311
00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:22.790
Now we can also see it several other times where,
um,

312
00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:26.210
Luke takes and changes things.
I talked about this at the very last,

313
00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:29.810
my of my session last time,
but I want to just reiterate it very quickly.

314
00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:31.010
So some of you,

315
00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:35.450
if you don't have throt Martins Gospel parallels or some other gospel parallels,

316
00:19:35.451 --> 00:19:37.850
this is why these are very useful cause I'm gonna use this that way.

317
00:19:37.851 --> 00:19:40.640
I have mark right here and Luke right here for the same passage and I can

318
00:19:40.641 --> 00:19:45.020
compare them very,
very directly,
see exactly what words they have differently.

319
00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:49.190
If you don't have that,
put one of your fingers where we talked about last time,

320
00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:54.220
mark 1314 through 27 that's mark 1314 through 27 and put another finger at Luke

321
00:19:59.901 --> 00:20:04.901
2120 through 33 Luke 2120 through 33 and if you have Throckmorton it's paragraph

322
00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:15.860
two 16 section two 16 and Throckmorton.

323
00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:17.663
<v 1>Okay.</v>

324
00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:26.200
<v 0>So look at the market passage first</v>

325
00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:32.920
three 14 but when you see the desolating sacrilege set up where it ought not to

326
00:20:32.921 --> 00:20:37.300
be,
let the reader understand.
And then he says,
get out of town.

327
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:39.550
Go Get out of Judea,

328
00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.640
go to the mountains because it's all all hell's breaking loose anytime.

329
00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:46.270
And then he gives several things.
They're there.
And if you look at Luke,

330
00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:51.510
where Luke a parallel on Luke 2120 Luke doesn't say the desolating sacrilege,

331
00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:56.530
he just says when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies,

332
00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:59.620
then know that its desolation has come near.

333
00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:03.130
See there's a common wording there,
but it's slightly different.

334
00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.050
And then Luke also leukocytosis.

335
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:07.990
Those inside the city should leave those in the country,
should not enter it.

336
00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:11.350
And then you go on th there's,
there's great distress in both places.

337
00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:15.880
Look at verse 21 of Mark 13 if anyone says to you at this time,

338
00:21:15.881 --> 00:21:18.910
look here the Messiah,
or look there,
yes,
do not believe it.
False profits.

339
00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:20.440
Now that's also gonna be in Luke,

340
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:24.300
been a totally different place that's kinetic contained in Luke chapter 17 so

341
00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:27.610
Luke's using that false prophet material.
But not in this context.

342
00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:33.960
And then look at mark 1324 but in those days,

343
00:21:34.061 --> 00:21:36.670
after that suffering,
the sun will be dark and the moon will not give it's light.

344
00:21:36.671 --> 00:21:38.620
The stars will be falling from heaven.
In other words,

345
00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:40.150
after all this other stuff he's told you,

346
00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:43.090
that's when the big catastrophic catastrophe takes place.

347
00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.700
The Sun eclipses the stars fall from heaven,
the Moon's dark.

348
00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:51.490
Luke also has something like that.
And Luke 2125 there will be signs in the sun,

349
00:21:51.491 --> 00:21:55.000
the moon and the stars and on earth distress among nations caused by the roaring

350
00:21:55.001 --> 00:21:58.120
of the seed people.
And so Luke is a slightly different material

351
00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:07.310
and
the problem is Luke,

352
00:22:07.311 --> 00:22:10.110
then
yes,

353
00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:12.930
notice how right after that it set,

354
00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:17.940
mark has the son of man coming with the clouds of glory in verse 26 so right

355
00:22:18.031 --> 00:22:20.040
after that you have the son of man coming down,

356
00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:23.820
but Luke has a bunch of more material and you don't get anything until you see

357
00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:28.850
Luke 2132 grace says this generation will not pass away until all things are

358
00:22:29.691 --> 00:22:32.770
taken place.
Heaven and earth will pass away.
But my words will not pass away.

359
00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:38.260
And then where does,
well,
I must have passed it.

360
00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:40.100
Where is it that uh,

361
00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:41.773
<v 1>okay,</v>

362
00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:45.720
<v 0>Luke talks about the time of the gentiles.
Give me the verse.</v>

363
00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:49.440
<v 1>Cool.</v>

364
00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.280
<v 0>24.</v>

365
00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:58.220
Yes,
that's right.
Um,
in 24,
they will,

366
00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:00.130
there'll be great distress on earth and residents.

367
00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:03.740
They will fall by the edge of the sword and be taken away as captive among all

368
00:23:03.741 --> 00:23:07.670
nations and Jerusalem will be trampled on by the gentiles until the time of the

369
00:23:07.671 --> 00:23:12.210
gentiles had been fulfilled.
So notice Luke in search,

370
00:23:12.211 --> 00:23:14.270
there is something that's not there and the other sources,

371
00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:19.120
which is that Jerusalem will be captured.
It'll be destroyed.
Uh,
j,
uh,

372
00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:22.010
there will have a time of the gentiles in between.

373
00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:26.540
And then Luke goes on to talk about the coming of Jesus and the,

374
00:23:26.541 --> 00:23:28.040
the very end again,

375
00:23:28.041 --> 00:23:33.041
one of these places where you can clearly see the editorial seams of the rider

376
00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:38.290
and you have the time of the gentiles.
So one,

377
00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:41.420
one of the things that we've seen is that Luke is carefully constructing his

378
00:23:41.421 --> 00:23:45.860
sources to make his own point.
What I want to do now is now turn attention to,

379
00:23:45.861 --> 00:23:47.240
okay,
what are some of those points?

380
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:50.110
What are some of the points we've already talked about?
What are some ones?

381
00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.550
Luke's basic messages.
One,

382
00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:55.130
Jesus is like the prophets.

383
00:23:55.490 --> 00:24:00.490
Jesus is like Elijah and Elisha to profits get rejected by their people.

384
00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:04.640
Three when you're rejected by the people,

385
00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:07.550
then the message goes out to other corners of the earth.

386
00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:11.330
And then this schematic view of history that we talked about later from

387
00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:11.570
[inaudible],

388
00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:16.570
from Jerusalem to Judea to area to the ends of the earth.

389
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:20.390
Now let's look at how some of these pleadings play out.

390
00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:25.160
One of Luke's most important messages is to the Jew.

391
00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:26.173
First,

392
00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:31.520
let's look at Luke one five through seven we're going to spend a little time in

393
00:24:31.521 --> 00:24:36.110
Luke.
Now,
the beginning parts of Luke.
Luke is very concerned to show,

394
00:24:36.111 --> 00:24:37.190
as I said last time,

395
00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:41.810
the John Jesus is a good Jewish boy.

396
00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:46.550
His parents are good Jewish parents.
He comes from good Jewish extended family.

397
00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:51.140
So Luke five this is right after the very beginning of the prologue,

398
00:24:51.141 --> 00:24:52.940
which I mentioned last week.
I talked about last time.

399
00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:55.070
In the days of King Herod of Judea.

400
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:58.960
There was a priest named Zechariah who belonged to the priestly order of Abajo.

401
00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:01.700
His wife was a descendant of Aaron.
Her name was Elizabeth.

402
00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:05.180
Both of them were righteous before God living blamelessly according to all the

403
00:25:05.181 --> 00:25:06.710
commandments and regulations of the Lord,

404
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:09.860
but they had no children because Elizabeth was barren and both were getting on

405
00:25:09.861 --> 00:25:10.694
in years.

406
00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:14.900
Doesn't that sound kind of familiar?

407
00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:16.521
Old,

408
00:25:16.521 --> 00:25:21.521
very righteous couple can't have children she's getting on in years.

409
00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.990
She's barren.

410
00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:31.040
Abraham and Sarah sounds like lots of people.
It sounds like Abraham and Sarah.

411
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:35.880
It also is going to sound like Hannah,
the mother of Samuel,
but there are,

412
00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:38.570
these are these wonderful stories in the Bible about,
you know,

413
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:41.270
this old couple who want to have children and can't have children.

414
00:25:41.271 --> 00:25:45.740
So this is already evoking this idea of Jesus's family being like a story.

415
00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:48.470
They're a family that you might find them right there in scripture.

416
00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:51.470
They're just like that.
Look at one 25

417
00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:56.720
uh,
this is when Elizabeth can see for five months she made seclusion.
You said,

418
00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:58.340
this is what the Lord has done for me.

419
00:25:58.341 --> 00:26:02.240
When he looked favorably on on me and took away the disgrace I've endured among

420
00:26:02.241 --> 00:26:03.074
my people.

421
00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:07.820
Sounds like it's right out of first Samuel second chapter.

422
00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:12.590
Look,
keep one finger right there.
In fact,

423
00:26:12.591 --> 00:26:16.970
first read chapter one 46 oh wait,

424
00:26:16.971 --> 00:26:21.110
this is the magnificant.
Yeah.
Look at chapter one 46 Mary said,

425
00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:25.280
my soul magnifies the Lord.
My spirit rejoices in God my savior,

426
00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:28.670
for he has looked with favor on the lowliness of his servant.
Surely from now on,

427
00:26:28.671 --> 00:26:31.430
all generations will call me blessing.
I read this last time.

428
00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:34.490
There's a lot of messages about the rich will be sent into away.

429
00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:38.150
The poor will be raised up the reversal of status in the world.

430
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:42.020
Now keep your finger there and go all the way to the Old Testament.

431
00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:44.130
The Hebrew Bible to first Samuel.

432
00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:48.030
It's right before the two books called kings,

433
00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:52.210
and right after the book called Ruth,

434
00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:00.720
First Samuel tells about the birth of the Prophet Samuel,
his mother's Hannah.

435
00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:06.300
And here's her story.
In chapter two of first Samuel,
Hannah prayed and said,

436
00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:11.190
my heart exults in the Lord.
My strength is exalted in my God mice mouth.

437
00:27:11.191 --> 00:27:13.860
Derides my enemies because I rejoice in my victory.

438
00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:16.470
There is no holy one like the Lord,
no one besides you.

439
00:27:16.471 --> 00:27:19.170
There's no rock like our God talk no more so proudly.

440
00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:21.090
Let not arrogance come from your mouth.

441
00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:24.150
For the Lord is a god of knowledge and by him actions are weighed.

442
00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:28.590
The bows of the mighty are broken,
but the feeble gird on strength,

443
00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:30.960
and it's a whole song.
You can read the whole thing there,

444
00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:36.050
but if you just keep one finger at first Samuel two and one finger at Luke one

445
00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:41.390
46 Mary's song is obviously fashioned on the song of Hannah.

446
00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:44.640
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

447
00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:49.410
<v 0>and the message is the reversal of status of rich and poor.
We can powerful.</v>

448
00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:52.890
That's not all.
Look at chapter one verse 14

449
00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:56.470
<v 1>yeah,</v>

450
00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:58.540
<v 0>this is talking about the birth of John The baptist.</v>

451
00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:01.510
His father's the priest Zachariah,
his mother's Elizabeth,

452
00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:05.350
and this is the prophecy that comes with the angel to Zachariah.

453
00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:09.370
You will have joy and gladness and many will rejoice in his birth for he will be

454
00:28:09.371 --> 00:28:10.510
great in the sight of the Lord.

455
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:14.410
He must never drink wine or strong drink even before his birth.

456
00:28:14.411 --> 00:28:17.020
Who will be filled with the Holy Spirit,
blah,
blah,
blah.

457
00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:22.240
John the Baptist is portrayed like Elijah.
Read stories about Elijah.

458
00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:27.220
Similar things you said about him.
Look at two 36 we're going to move quickly.

459
00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:34.960
There was a prophet Anna,
the daughter of Fenway,
of the tribe of Asher.

460
00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:38.860
You hear how biblical that sounds.
That's real biblical.

461
00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:41.590
The guy who wrote this,
I don't think he was a Jew.

462
00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:44.980
I think there's probably a gentile,
but he spoke Greek as his main language,

463
00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:49.630
so it's not like he's,
he's just,
you know,
automatically talking this way.

464
00:28:49.631 --> 00:28:49.961
In a sense,

465
00:28:49.961 --> 00:28:53.290
I think he's consciously constructing his book to sound like the Bible,

466
00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:57.220
to sound like the Jewish scripture.
She was a great age,

467
00:28:57.221 --> 00:28:59.740
having lived with her husband's seven years after our marriage than as a widow

468
00:28:59.741 --> 00:29:02.800
to the age of 84 she never left the temple.

469
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:07.260
There's a temple,
but worshiped there with fasting and prayer night and day.

470
00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:10.500
At that moment she came to,
began to praise God to speak about the child.

471
00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:13.800
That's Jesus to all.
You're looking for redemption of Israel.

472
00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:15.930
So Anna is this holy woman.

473
00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:19.860
Just like many of the holy woman in the Bible and then you have these songs and

474
00:29:19.861 --> 00:29:23.220
prayers.
I've already talked about magnificant that Mary says,

475
00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:27.030
look also at one 68 chapter one 68.

476
00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:29.180
<v 1>Okay.</v>

477
00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:33.500
<v 0>This is the prayer that semi,
uh,
Zachariah,</v>

478
00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:38.870
the father of John the Baptist praise blessed be the Lord God of Israel for he

479
00:29:38.871 --> 00:29:40.910
has looked favorably on his people and redeemed them.

480
00:29:40.911 --> 00:29:43.750
He raised up a mighty savior for us in the house of separate David.

481
00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:46.930
In other words,
he goes on to quote basically what sounds like a song.

482
00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:52.090
It's very much a song like piece of literary poetry there.

483
00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:54.910
Mary had her Magnificat,
which sounds like scripture.

484
00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:58.240
Zachariah has his benedictus.
Again,

485
00:29:58.241 --> 00:30:02.080
these are the songs that if you're a Roman Catholic or if you're an episcopalian

486
00:30:02.081 --> 00:30:03.080
or dilute urine,

487
00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:05.590
say the magnificant and the Benedictus and these things in liturgy.

488
00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:10.180
Any Lutherans in here?
No.
Any other denominations in here to say these things?

489
00:30:10.181 --> 00:30:14.050
I'm not sure I know which ones actually say the magnificant caught my soul

490
00:30:14.051 --> 00:30:15.460
magnifies the lord of the Benedictus.

491
00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.440
But if you're Roman Catholic or Episcopalian,

492
00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:21.400
you say these songs as part of the liturgy,
they come from the New Testament,

493
00:30:21.401 --> 00:30:25.270
but they sound very much like the Old Testament.
So Zachariah has one,
we call it,

494
00:30:25.271 --> 00:30:27.040
they'd been a Dick twos because in Latin,

495
00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:28.780
if you had a Latin Bible in front of you,

496
00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:34.020
the first word of that psalm would be benedict twos molested my soul.

497
00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:36.400
Um,
yeah bless.
It'd be the Lord God of Israel.

498
00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:39.280
The other song is to 19,

499
00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:45.150
which Simeon praise Simeon's is holy man living in the temple again.

500
00:30:45.851 --> 00:30:50.200
There's that theme of the temple when he sees Jesus the baby,
he says,
master,

501
00:30:50.201 --> 00:30:53.530
now let.
Now you are dismissing your servant in peace according to your word,

502
00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:55.420
for my eyes,
have seen your salvation,

503
00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:57.370
which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples.

504
00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:00.910
A light for revelation to the gentiles.

505
00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:03.340
Already at the very beginning of the Gospel,

506
00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:06.910
though Jesus himself won't go to the gentiles during his life.

507
00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:11.140
This is something that Luke will wait until acts to show us.
Simeon predicts it.

508
00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:12.970
He prophesies about it in this little song.

509
00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:17.080
This is called the nuke deputies in critic Christian literature,

510
00:31:17.081 --> 00:31:20.830
surgical tradition,
because in Latin now departs your servant.

511
00:31:20.831 --> 00:31:22.000
That's what the Latin means.

512
00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:25.300
Then there's the piety of the holy family already mentioned before.

513
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:28.360
Only Luke tells us about the circumcision of Jesus.

514
00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:34.020
Chapter two Verse 21 only Luke tells us in two 22 this is where they're looking

515
00:31:34.961 --> 00:31:38.410
at,
that after the prescribed period,

516
00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:41.260
according to the law of Moses,
see,

517
00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:43.990
Jesus's family followed the law of Moses very well.

518
00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:47.680
They brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord.

519
00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:49.570
As it is written in the law of the Lord,

520
00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:52.210
every firstborn male shall be designated as holy to the Lord.

521
00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:55.060
They offered a sacrifice according to what is stated in the law of the Lord,

522
00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:58.990
a pair of turtle doves,
and two young pigeons.
In other words,
over and over again,

523
00:31:58.991 --> 00:32:00.880
I could cite several different as an examples.

524
00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:04.000
Luke wants to portray the holy family,

525
00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:08.350
John the Baptist family and the holy family of Jesus and Jesus himself as all

526
00:32:08.351 --> 00:32:12.280
being good Jews who honor the temple,
who keep the law.

527
00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:14.260
They do everything like they're supposed to do.

528
00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:17.920
And so it's no surprise that when you get to the book of acts,

529
00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:23.320
the theme that comes out more than anything is to the Jew first.
So look at acts.

530
00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:26.130
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

531
00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:29.520
<v 0>I'm not gonna read all this,
but acts 1346.</v>

532
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:40.100
<v 1>This is Paul</v>

533
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:44.510
<v 0>and Barnabas.
They'd been speaking on the Sabbath Day,</v>

534
00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:49.460
uh,
to uh,
sit the a synagogue and the people,

535
00:32:49.461 --> 00:32:53.480
some of them believe in some get jealous and verse chapter 13,

536
00:32:53.481 --> 00:32:57.830
verse 46 then both Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly saying it was necessary

537
00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:02.300
that the word of God should be spoken first to you.
That is to the Jews.

538
00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:07.010
Since you reject it and judge yourselves to be unworthy of eternal life,

539
00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:11.600
we are now turning to the gentiles.
It happens again.

540
00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:16.430
The same thing is said in acts eight chapter 18 verse six.

541
00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:21.680
The same thing is said in chapter 26,
verse 20

542
00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:26.110
over and over again.
See,
Paul goes for it.
He goes to a town,

543
00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:31.210
he goes first to the synagogue.
He preaches in the synagogue.
The Jews reject him.

544
00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:35.470
He's kind of shakes the dust off his feet.
You Jews rejected the Gospel,

545
00:33:35.471 --> 00:33:37.570
therefore we're going to the gentiles.

546
00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:41.440
But he never gets to a point where he finally and completely turns away from the

547
00:33:41.441 --> 00:33:43.750
Jews.
He keeps going back to the Jews and every town he gets too.

548
00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:48.190
But this idea that the message must be preached first to the Jews and only then

549
00:33:48.191 --> 00:33:51.850
to the gentiles is a point that acts makes over and over and over again.

550
00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:54.640
So is it any surprise that in the gospel of Luke,

551
00:33:54.641 --> 00:33:58.540
he wanted it to be so careful to set up Jesus as a good Jew?

552
00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:04.240
That's the beginning of it.
It's only later that it will go to the gentiles.

553
00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:08.020
So that pattern gets played out over and over again until the very end of x.

554
00:34:08.021 --> 00:34:12.040
Now look at the end of acts chapter 28 of acts,
verse 28

555
00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:15.493
<v 1>okay,</v>

556
00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:22.540
<v 0>this is at the end of Paul's last speech and acts.</v>

557
00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:28.690
He was in Jerusalem.
He was actually trying to go worship in the temple,

558
00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:33.130
but some of the bad Jews who didn't like Paul,

559
00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:36.070
thought he was trying to take gen piles into the temple,

560
00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:38.380
which would have been against the law.

561
00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:43.860
So they grab him our big riot in suse and they take Paul before the Sanhedrin

562
00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:49.590
that the big sort of Jerusalem kind of Senate type body and they put him on

563
00:34:49.751 --> 00:34:53.800
trial.
Paul's message and all these things is that I didn't do anything wrong.

564
00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.020
I'm just here to obey the law.

565
00:34:56.021 --> 00:34:59.320
I'm here to serve the my people,

566
00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:04.240
to honor the traditions of my people and my,
my ethnic,
my ethnic group,
the Jews.

567
00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:09.780
And then eventually though such a big dispute arises him that Paul is arrested

568
00:35:10.001 --> 00:35:14.050
by the Roman governor in order.
He says to protect Paul from being lynched.

569
00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:17.200
Paul is in prison.
Then uh,

570
00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:21.010
finally Paul is afraid he's going to lose a trial with these,

571
00:35:21.011 --> 00:35:24.340
his Jewish enemies on one side.
So he appeals to the Roman governor,

572
00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:28.450
straight to the emperor.
He says,
I'm a Roman citizen.
I appealed the emperor.

573
00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:31.660
So that means he has to go to Rome.
They have to take him to Rome for trial.

574
00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.660
So the last part,
Chapter 28 is Paul in Rome.

575
00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:37.770
He preaches again there you have the kind of things happen.

576
00:35:37.771 --> 00:35:39.400
He rents a hall where he,

577
00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:42.030
he again conducts classes and conduct sermons and that sort of thing.

578
00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:45.390
And then this last sermon that he's given to the Jewish leaders in the Jewish

579
00:35:45.391 --> 00:35:48.090
elders,
and notice how it turns out,
he says,

580
00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:52.350
let it be known to you then that the salvation of God has been sent to the

581
00:35:52.351 --> 00:35:54.750
gentiles.
They will listen.

582
00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:57.990
He lived there two whole years of his own expense.

583
00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:01.230
He welcomed all who came to him proclaiming the Kingdom of God and teaching

584
00:36:01.231 --> 00:36:04.590
about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness and without hindrance.

585
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:06.180
In other words,

586
00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:11.180
the very end of the two volume work ends with this message that the message was

587
00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:14.190
preached to the Jews.
They rejected it.

588
00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:17.850
So Paul and the others went to the gentiles and it ends up in Rome,

589
00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:20.700
the capital of the whole world,

590
00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:24.930
which represents the idea that the gospel has now proceeded to the whole world.

591
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:31.390
Isn't it funny that this author doesn't tell us what happened to Paul?

592
00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:38.850
Does he mind know how Paul supposedly died?

593
00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:45.000
Anybody know?
Yes sir.
He was decapitated,

594
00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:50.250
not accidentally.
It was a Roman sword that did it.

595
00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:52.500
According to Christian tradition,

596
00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:58.710
Jesus Paul was martyred by being beheaded because he was a Roman soldier.

597
00:36:58.770 --> 00:36:59.880
Again,
according to the tradition,

598
00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:02.520
Paul actually never tells us he was a Roman citizen.

599
00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:06.060
He never tells us that it was a Roman citizen,
but according tradition,

600
00:37:06.061 --> 00:37:08.340
he was in fact,
an ax claims that he was a Roman citizen.

601
00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:11.490
So according to that tradition,
you can't crucify a Roman citizen.

602
00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:14.460
So the tradition was that Paul was martyred,

603
00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:18.750
but unlike Peter who was crucified upside down,
according to tradition,

604
00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:24.380
Paul was beheaded in Rome probably sometime in the 60s.

605
00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:25.913
That's the tradition.

606
00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:30.330
Why doesn't Luke tell us that story?

607
00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:33.600
Wouldn't that be the more logical end of the story?

608
00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:37.470
He's told us about Paul's ministry?
He told her about Paul's call.

609
00:37:37.471 --> 00:37:41.160
He's taught us Paul becoming an apostle.
He's told about Paul,
uh,

610
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:42.420
different missionary journeys.

611
00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:46.050
And he ends up with Paul living in rented rooms in Rome.

612
00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:51.270
I don't think this author wanted us to tell us about how the story ended,

613
00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:53.970
if it actually ended with Paul being martyred in Rome,

614
00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:57.150
because that kind of would spoil the story,
wouldn't it?

615
00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:02.710
Although you kind of could get the hint that since all profits and all
messenger,

616
00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:06.060
the Gospel according to this author are martyred and rejected,

617
00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:10.860
then maybe he could've portrayed Paul as a martyr and told about his death after

618
00:38:10.861 --> 00:38:12.270
all the cause.

619
00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:16.020
And that's a nice little segue into the next major theme of Luke Acts.

620
00:38:16.021 --> 00:38:19.230
And I'm going to talk about profits as martyrs.

621
00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:23.160
Profits in Luke acts get martyred.

622
00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:28.500
Jesus was one of them.
So notice first John the baptist.

623
00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:30.900
John,
I'm not going to read this because we're running a little bit out of time.

624
00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:34.200
John the Baptist himself gets martyred.

625
00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:40.210
Jesus also is a profit marker.
Look at act,
uh,
Luke nine 31.

626
00:38:40.211 --> 00:38:42.640
Now unfortunately going to be going back and forth from Luke to ax.

627
00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:46.120
So you might want to keep fingers in both places.
This is very important.

628
00:38:46.121 --> 00:38:48.400
Point nine 31 of Luke,

629
00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:49.953
<v 1>okay,</v>

630
00:38:56.280 --> 00:39:01.260
<v 0>this is the transfiguration story.
You know how it goes.
Jesus.</v>

631
00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:04.770
Take some of his disciples,
Peter,
John,
and James up onto a mountain,

632
00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:07.500
and while they're up there,
this is on their way to Jerusalem.

633
00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:11.130
Clouds overcome it's,
you know,
thunder and lightening.

634
00:39:11.131 --> 00:39:14.850
Imagine Cecil B de Mille Hollywood type lighting effects,

635
00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:19.320
and Jesus appears there with Moses and Elijah flaming just just,
they're all,

636
00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:22.950
they're shining.
And Peter says something.
There's a voice from heaven,

637
00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:27.930
all that sort of thing.
But notice most of the gospels don't tell us what p,

638
00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:32.730
what Jesus and Moses and Elijah were talking about up on the mountain.

639
00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:34.140
Luke tells us

640
00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:41.080
31 they appeared in glory and we're speaking of his departure,

641
00:39:41.350 --> 00:39:43.930
which was about to be accomplished at Jerusalem.

642
00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:48.850
Now the Greek word there for departure is exodus.

643
00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:53.620
Yep.
That word,
the very word of the second book of the Bible in Greek.

644
00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:59.110
They're talking to Jesus about his exodus.
If you read that in Greek,

645
00:39:59.111 --> 00:40:02.530
that would immediately say,
oh,
I,
now I know why Moses is there talking to them.

646
00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:05.970
He needs some advice on how to do an exodus.

647
00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:09.960
And the exodus doesn't refer to just his leaving the country.

648
00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:12.360
He refers to his martyrdom.

649
00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:18.030
And also Jesus also will be portrayed as the profit to the Jews first.

650
00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:21.270
I've already talked about Steven being a prophet and a martyr.

651
00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:25.380
The end of acts with Paul in Rome.
Again,
I just read it to you.

652
00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:30.360
Paul ends up as a prophet to the Jews.
He is the innocent martyr.

653
00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:34.260
Uh,
he's proclaimed innocent over and over again several times.

654
00:40:34.261 --> 00:40:38.940
As a matter of fact,
um,
Paul will be proclaimed first.

655
00:40:38.941 --> 00:40:42.750
Jesus is proclaimed as innocent people that the different realtors will say,

656
00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:44.910
you know,
this guy's innocent.
He's innocent.
What are you doing?

657
00:40:44.911 --> 00:40:46.920
What are you getting upset about?
And over,
and again,

658
00:40:46.921 --> 00:40:50.280
Paul himself will be taken to governors,
Roman governors,
and they'll say,

659
00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:54.060
you know,
well,
I would have released him,
but now he's appealed to Rome.

660
00:40:54.061 --> 00:40:56.610
So we've got to send him to Rome when it gets to Rome.

661
00:40:57.060 --> 00:41:00.000
Even the Jewish elders in Rome who first set and they'd say,

662
00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:04.140
now we've heard rumors,
Paul,
that about you.
We've heard some bad stuff about you,

663
00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:09.470
but we don't have any good evidence.
You're innocent as far as we're concerned.

664
00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:14.750
Even the Jewish leaders in Rome declare Paul innocent.

665
00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:19.820
So over and over again,
people in the book of acts and,
and Luke,

666
00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:23.300
um,
are portrayed as innocent martyrs and profits.

667
00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:28.600
Notice how we see they're all these different diversities of Christianity.
No,

668
00:41:28.601 --> 00:41:29.840
just some basic themes.

669
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:33.980
But if you take what do these different Christian groups about the Jewish law,

670
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:38.030
what did Moses believed about the Jewish law?
Anybody remember?

671
00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:43.610
What was Moses stance on what people should do with the Jewish law?

672
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:47.750
You know,
just remember back a week or so.

673
00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:53.780
What did I say,
Moses?
I mean,
Matthew,
I'm sorry.

674
00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:59.690
I'm crazy.
What was Matthew's view of the,
of the mosaic law?

675
00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:01.940
What did Matthew believe about the mosaic law?

676
00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:06.500
All followers of Jesus should obey it.
It's just there.

677
00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:09.170
Matthew does never get rid of the Jewish law.

678
00:42:09.171 --> 00:42:10.820
He never has Jesus get rid of the Jewish law.

679
00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:14.450
What does mark say about the Jewish law?
Well,

680
00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:16.640
Jesus declared all foods clean.

681
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:21.860
So Jesus modifies the Jewish law in a substantial way for mark.

682
00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:26.630
What does Luke believe about the Jewish law?
And this is an interesting point.

683
00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:32.200
Luke believes that the Jewish law is the ethnic contract,

684
00:42:33.201 --> 00:42:37.520
if you will,
the ethnic traditions of the Jews.
It's,
it came from God.

685
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:42.980
It came from Moses and Jews.
Keep it so throughout acts,
if you notice,

686
00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:47.480
the Jewish followers of Jesus continued to keep the law.
Even Paul,

687
00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:52.220
the gentile followers of Jesus aren't required to keep the law.

688
00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:58.070
It's it's as if,
and and people need to wear a nudist.
Americans have their law,

689
00:42:58.730 --> 00:43:03.590
Canadians have their law.
Britain's have their law,
the French have their law,

690
00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:05.473
sort of

691
00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:12.380
every nation and ethnic group has its own laws,
right?

692
00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:17.990
This is the way Lucas thinking about the Jewish law.
He says,
of course it's good.

693
00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:21.860
It's good for Jews.
So should Jews avoid pork?
Yeah,

694
00:43:21.861 --> 00:43:25.550
they're Jews should use be circumcised.
Yeah,
they're Jews.

695
00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:29.510
Even if they're followers of Jesus,
they still keep the Jewish law

696
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:33.230
gentiles totally.
Or the story.

697
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:37.520
Why should they not keep the law of Moses?
They're not Jews.

698
00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:41.030
So Luke's,
the view of,

699
00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:46.060
of the law of Moses that you get in Luke and acts is that the law is good ethnic

700
00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:52.910
law and custom for the Jewish people and it's perfectly fine for them to obey it

701
00:43:52.911 --> 00:43:57.440
and to keep it.
It's just not binding on the gentile followers of Jesus.

702
00:43:58.130 --> 00:44:01.460
They will have other ethical things to follow and he gives you some of those

703
00:44:01.461 --> 00:44:04.210
things and chapter 15 so that's,

704
00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:09.260
that's actually very different from what we've seen in Matthew or even in mark,

705
00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:12.170
right?
Luke has a different view of the law.

706
00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:16.400
These are diversity's of Christianity.
We see they weren't all this,

707
00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:18.050
they weren't all in agreement about this.

708
00:44:18.110 --> 00:44:20.000
They probably didn't even know what the others thought.

709
00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:23.510
They may have been living in different geographical areas and just develop their

710
00:44:23.511 --> 00:44:25.400
own different views about what should,

711
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:28.010
what is the Jewish law and how should it affect the followers of Jesus.

712
00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:31.070
When we get to Paul,
it'll be another story

713
00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:34.290
because it may surprise you.

714
00:44:34.291 --> 00:44:38.570
Paul will believe Luke seems to believe that he doesn't really come out and say

715
00:44:38.571 --> 00:44:42.990
it.
If there's a gentile who sort of wants to keep kosher or wants to get

716
00:44:42.991 --> 00:44:46.730
circumcised,
well,
it's no big deal that he has.
Paul circumcised.

717
00:44:46.731 --> 00:44:51.540
Timothy is follower.
Uh,
at one point Timothy wasn't circumcised.

718
00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:54.060
They're going to be going through some Jewish areas.
So Paul says,
yeah,

719
00:44:54.061 --> 00:44:56.820
let's circumcise Timothy.
Well,

720
00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.900
the Paul of his letters doesn't like that at all.
He basically says,

721
00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:03.540
if you're a follower of Jesus and a gentile,

722
00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:08.340
you cannot keep the Jewish law,
otherwise you will fall from grace

723
00:45:10.050 --> 00:45:12.540
trying to keep the law.
The law of Moses,

724
00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:15.300
if you're a gentile disciple of Jesus,

725
00:45:15.690 --> 00:45:20.690
is anathema for Paul and that'll get him in big trouble with both Jews and

726
00:45:23.701 --> 00:45:26.370
Jewish Christians,
Jewish followers of Jesus.

727
00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:29.550
So what the point I'm making is that when we get to Paula,

728
00:45:29.551 --> 00:45:32.430
we'll see another different kind of view of the law.

729
00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:36.390
So it all shows that these people were trying to figure out what does it mean to

730
00:45:36.391 --> 00:45:38.910
follow a Jewish Messiah if you're not Jewish,

731
00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:43.830
what does it mean that we're following a messiah who was predicted by Moses in

732
00:45:43.831 --> 00:45:47.880
the law and yet we're not keeping the law.
In fact,
they'd say,

733
00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:51.030
what does it mean to have a messiah at all?
What does Messiah mean?

734
00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:52.770
And here's the last little difference.

735
00:45:52.771 --> 00:45:55.350
I'll say in the next two or three minutes because we'll come back to this also.

736
00:45:55.950 --> 00:46:00.950
We've already seen different Christologies one of those two bit words again,

737
00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:03.480
what does Christology mean?

738
00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:05.743
<v 3>Anybody?</v>

739
00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:09.370
<v 0>Chris Allergy,</v>

740
00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:13.470
whether you believe Jesus was human or divine,

741
00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:15.850
whether you believe Jesus was human or divine,
very good.

742
00:46:15.851 --> 00:46:20.050
It means any doctrine of Jesus.
It could be whether is human to divine,

743
00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:24.280
it could be whether he's,
you know,
uh,
uh,
fish.

744
00:46:25.450 --> 00:46:28.210
Any teaching about Jesus is a Christology.

745
00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:32.140
It's what is your theology of Jesus Christ.
That's Christology.

746
00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:34.810
And we've already seen different ones.
For example,

747
00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:38.280
I've already said mark.
Um,

748
00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:42.130
Luke mark believes that Jesus,

749
00:46:42.131 --> 00:46:47.080
his death was a ransom.
Jesus died for your sins.

750
00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:49.960
His death was sort of like a sacrifice say.

751
00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:53.770
But at one point in mark 10 45,

752
00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:56.800
Jesus says to his disciples,

753
00:46:56.950 --> 00:47:00.430
the son of man came to give his life as a ransom for many.

754
00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:02.780
In other words,
Jesus,

755
00:47:02.781 --> 00:47:07.160
his death is for you to buy you up to save you.

756
00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:12.080
That's picked up in Matthew 2028 do you know what that saying is?

757
00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:15.260
Never found in Luke.
In fact,

758
00:47:15.261 --> 00:47:17.270
you can find nothing in the gospel of Luke,

759
00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:22.610
which identifies the death of Jesus as being an atonement for sins of people.

760
00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:28.840
Luke does not take Jesus' death as being a ransom in the way that Mark Matthew

761
00:47:29.441 --> 00:47:33.880
do.
Why Jesus,
his death is important for Luke,
right?

762
00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:38.710
But again,
what is the meaning of Jesus's death in Luke a profit martyr.

763
00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:42.790
He's the innocent prophet who is more martyred for his prophecy.

764
00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:47.290
That's the meaning of the death of Jesus in Luke and acts,

765
00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:50.980
so we have very different christologies about the meaning of the death of Jesus

766
00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:54.040
already in these different gospels.
All of this is just to say,

767
00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:56.440
we're going to find this again.
We can find it in John.

768
00:47:56.441 --> 00:47:59.380
We're going to find it in other places early.
These early Christian texts,

769
00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:02.920
if you read them really,
really carefully,
not quickly,
carefully,

770
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:08.080
you'll see amazing ways that it opens up toll windows into the very earliest

771
00:48:08.081 --> 00:48:11.650
period of Christianity that most modern people have no idea existed.

772
00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:14.950
The idea that there could be Christians who didn't believe Jesus,

773
00:48:14.951 --> 00:48:16.120
his life was an atonement.

774
00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:19.870
The idea that there were Christians who believed every Christian should keep the

775
00:48:19.871 --> 00:48:22.180
Jewish law.
The idea.

776
00:48:22.181 --> 00:48:24.490
We've also seen that there could have been Christians who believed that the god

777
00:48:24.491 --> 00:48:27.610
who created the world was evil.
These were all there.

778
00:48:29.290 --> 00:48:32.410
We'll talk about another form of it next week.
See you next week.
