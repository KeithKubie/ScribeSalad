00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.910
Unlike recessive trait pedigrees, dominant traits appear

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.960
more frequently within a pedigree, and often

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.120
do not skip generations. I'm showing you here a really great example of a

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.080
dominant trait called achondroplasia. Achondroplasia is a

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.210
major cause of dwarfism in humans. Now

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.400
in this particular pedigree, again you'll notice

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.445
right away that it effects every generation. Right?

00:00:25.445 --> 00:00:28.775
We see every generation from grandparents to parents

00:00:28.775 --> 00:00:32.790
to children, we see affected individuals. Now to this

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.980
point in the course, we haven't talked about

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.720
any specific genetic alleles that cause achondroplasia, but no

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.990
worry. We can go back to using our

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.520
symbols like we were using for lactose intolerance, the

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.010
plus and the minus. In this case, the

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.710
plus or the dominant allele is actually for achondroplasia

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.670
which causes dwarfism, and the minus allele is

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.220
what we're going to call quote, unquote normal. In this

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.404
case what we mean by normal is just

00:00:59.404 --> 00:01:02.519
normal height. So take a look at this particular

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:05.701
grandfather in this pedigree of the dominant trait

00:01:05.701 --> 00:01:08.513
of anchandroplasia, and I want you to tell me

00:01:08.513 --> 00:01:13.360
what are the possible genotypes of this indicated grandfather?

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.060
This question is not as simple as it seems,

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.585
so take a nice hard look at the pedigree here and then give

00:01:19.585 --> 00:01:23.630
it your best shot. Check any and all boxes that you think apply.
