00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:01.850
Let's say I'm over here.

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:03.110
I'm going to do two scenarios.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:04.650
So I'm an observer over here.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.990
This is me.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.730
And then maybe even better,
I should just draw my eyeball

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.920
because we're going
to be observing light.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.130
So I'm just going
to draw my eyeball.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.530
So this is me in the
first scenario or this

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.120
is one of my eyeballs.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.830
And then this is
one of my eyeballs

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.192
in the second scenario.

00:00:24.192 --> 00:00:26.150
Now in the first scenario--
so let me draw it--

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.316
so in both scenarios, we're
going to have an object.

00:00:28.316 --> 00:00:31.820
We're going to have some
type of source of light.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.080
But in the first
scenario, relative to me,

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.070
the source of light
will not be moving.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.740
While in the second
scenario, the source

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.590
of light-- just for the sake
of discussion, just for fun--

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.600
will be moving at half
the speed of light.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.260
Unimaginably fast speed, but
let's just assuming that it is.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.530
So it's moving at-- it
has a velocity of 1/2

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:02.760
the speed of light, 1/2
light speed away from me

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.220
who is the observer.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.190
Now let's just imagine
what would happen.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.490
They're both emitting light.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.906
So and they're
both going to start

00:01:09.906 --> 00:01:12.150
emitting light at
the exact same time.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.220
And when they start
emitting light,

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.090
they're both at the exact
same distance from my eye.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.940
The only difference
is is that this

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.850
is stationary, relative to
me, while this is moving away

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.950
from me at half
the speed of light.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.500
So let's say that after
some period of time,

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.150
that the light wave from
this source reaches my eye.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.930
And then it looks
something like this.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.060
I'll try my best to draw it.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.761
So let's say I have-- I want
to draw a couple of wavelengths

00:01:42.761 --> 00:01:43.260
here.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.830
So let's say that's
half a wavelength.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.030
That's a full wavelength.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.080
That's another half, a full
wavelength, another half,

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.631
full wavelength, and
then a half, and then

00:01:53.631 --> 00:01:54.380
a full wavelength.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.920
So let me see if
I can draw that.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.920
So it would look
like full wavelength,

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.480
full wavelength,
full wave length.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.610
This is not easy to do.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.470
And then you got
another full wavelength.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.650
So it would look something
like that, the actual waveform.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.370
And so the front of the wave
form is just getting to my eye.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.440
And then as the wave forms
keep going past my eye,

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.470
my eye will perceive some type
of a wave length or frequency

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.490
and perceive it to be
some type of color,

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.360
assuming that we're
in the visible part

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.694
of the electromagnetic spectrum.

00:02:28.694 --> 00:02:30.110
Now let's think
about what's going

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.770
to happen with this source.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.610
So the first thing is is that
the front of the wave form

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.930
is going to reach me
at the exact same time.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.300
One of those neat and amazing
things about light travelling

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.860
in general, or
especially in a vacuum,

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.520
it doesn't matter that this
is moving away from me at half

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.690
the speed of light.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.900
The light will still
move towards me

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.477
at the speed of light.

00:02:52.477 --> 00:02:53.060
It's absolute.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.749
It doesn't matter if
this is going away at 0.9

00:02:55.749 --> 00:02:56.540
the speed of light.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.217
The light will still travel
to me at the speed of light.

00:03:00.217 --> 00:03:01.300
And it's very unintuitive.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.140
Because in our everyday sense,
if I'm moving away from you

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.330
at half the speed of a
bullet and I shoot a bullet,

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.730
the bullet will only
move towards you

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.694
at-- it'll kind of--
that half of its velocity

00:03:12.694 --> 00:03:13.485
will be subtracted.

00:03:13.485 --> 00:03:17.357
And it'll only move towards me
at half of its normal velocity,

00:03:17.357 --> 00:03:18.940
relative to whether
it was stationary,

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.524
but not the case with the light.

00:03:20.524 --> 00:03:22.190
So with that out of
the way, let's think

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.460
about what the wave
form would look like.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.251
So by the time the
light reached here,

00:03:27.251 --> 00:03:29.750
we need to think of-- let me
actually redraw this over here.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:37.360
Let me redraw this
eyeball right over here.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.690
So this is me again.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.500
So by the time the light reaches
my eye-- so they both started

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.660
emitting the light at
the exact same time--

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.570
this guy has traveled
half this distance.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.150
If it took light a certain
amount of time to get this far,

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.740
this guy will get half as far
in that same amount of time.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.810
So by the time the
light reaches my eye,

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.560
this guy will have traveled
about half that distance.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.740
So he would have
traveled about that far.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.090
They started emitting the
light at the same time.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.600
So that very first photon, if
you view light as a particle,

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.180
will reach my eye at
the very same time

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.040
as the very first
photon from this guy.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.550
So the wave form is going
to essentially be stretched.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.560
So instead of having--
so we're still

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:28.352
going to have one, two,
three, four full wavelengths,

00:04:28.352 --> 00:04:29.560
but they'll now be stretched.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.650
Let me see if I can draw
four full wavelengths.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.040
So let me cut this
in half over here.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.800
And let me cut each
of those in half.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.670
So each of these are going
to be a full wavelength.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:47.030
And then they're going to have
a half wavelength in between.

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.295
And so the wave form is
going to look like this.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.200
Let me try my best to draw it.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.800
This is the hardest part,
drawing the stretched out wave

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.302
form.

00:05:00.302 --> 00:05:01.010
And there you go.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.450
It's going to look like this.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.740
And so when it gets
to my eye, my eye

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.790
is going to perceive it as
having a longer wavelength,

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.990
even though from the
perspective of each

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.410
of these objects, if you're
traveling with each of them,

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.550
the frequency and the
wavelength of the light emitted

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:16.380
is the same.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.910
The only difference is this
guy's moving away from me--

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.490
or I'm moving away
from it, depending

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.600
on how you want to view
it-- while I am stationary,

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.310
while in this first case,
the observer and the source

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:27.660
are both stationary.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.940
Now, in this situation,
what's my eye going to say?

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.170
Well, my eye will get each
of these successive pulses,

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.400
or each of these
successive wave trains.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.740
And it's going to say, hey,
there's a longer wavelength

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:46.280
here, a perceived
longer wavelength--

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:51.680
let me write that-- perceived
longer wavelength here,

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.265
and also, a perceived
lower frequency.

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.220
So what would that do to
the perception of the light?

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.440
Let's say that this
is green light.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.330
So if you are stationary
with the observer,

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:09.684
it would be green light.

00:06:09.684 --> 00:06:11.600
So let's look at the
electromagnetic spectrum.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.750
I got this off of Wikipedia.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.850
So if I were stationary
towards-- with the observer,

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.190
we'd be in the green light
part of the spectrum,

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:23.970
so a 500 nanometer wavelength.

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.380
But if all of a sudden,
because the object

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.800
is moving away from me
at this huge velocity,

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.560
the perceived wavelength
becomes wider.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.420
So from my perception,
it is going

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.495
to have a wider wavelength.

00:06:36.495 --> 00:06:37.870
And you can see
what's happening.

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.270
It will look redder.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.480
It will move towards the
red part of the spectrum.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.850
And this phenomenon
is called redshift.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.974
And I've done a bunch of
videos of the physics playlist

00:06:55.974 --> 00:06:56.890
on the Doppler effect.

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.890
And over there, I talk about
sound waves and the perceived

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:02.310
frequency of sound-- if
something travels towards you

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:05.280
verses away from you--
as the exact same idea.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.380
This is the Doppler
effect applied to light.

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.600
And the reason why
the Doppler effect

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.100
works for light
traveling through space

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.350
and for sound
traveling through air

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.640
is because the sound
wave in air, regardless

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.910
of whether the
source is moving away

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:21.290
or towards you,
the sound wave is

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.970
going to move at the
speed of sound in air

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:25.910
at a certain pressure
and all of that.

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:27.250
And light is the same thing.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:32.310
But in a vacuum, It will always,
regardless of the source,

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:34.740
regardless of what
the source is doing,

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:36.910
the actual light wave
itself will always

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:39.130
travel at the same velocity.

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:42.260
The only difference is is
that its perceived frequency

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:43.676
and wavelength will change.

00:07:43.676 --> 00:07:45.800
And now the whole reason
why I'm talking about this

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.460
is you can use this
property of light,

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.510
that it gets redshift, to see
whether things are traveling

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:55.140
away or towards you.

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:57.690
And people talk about redshift
because, frankly, most things

00:07:57.690 --> 00:07:59.020
are traveling away from us.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.802
And that's one of
the reasons why

00:08:00.802 --> 00:08:02.260
we tend to believe
in the Big Bang.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.660
The opposite, if something
is traveling towards me

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.946
at super high
velocities, then we

00:08:07.946 --> 00:08:09.320
would have something
called-- you

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.236
don't hear the word--
it would be violetshift.

00:08:11.236 --> 00:08:12.450
The frequency would increase.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.470
So it would look
bluer or more purple.

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:19.110
Now the other thing
I want to highlight

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:21.930
is this redshift
phenomenon, this idea,

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.830
it doesn't apply only
to visible light.

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:27.240
So it could even apply the
things that we can't even see.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.770
So it would only-- it
would become redder.

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:31.354
But it's not like
you can even see.

00:08:31.354 --> 00:08:32.770
It could even be
applied to things

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:34.280
that are even more red than red.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.030
So maybe it's a microwave
that is being emitted.

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:40.080
But because the source is
moving away from us so fast,

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.354
it could be perceived
as an actual radio wave.

00:08:44.354 --> 00:08:46.770
And actually, I should have
talked about this in the video

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:49.630
on the microwave
background radiation

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:52.820
is that we're perceiving
it as microwaves.

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:55.830
But these sources were
moving away from us.

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:57.290
They were being redshift.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:00.870
So they were not actually
emitting microwave radiation.

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:03.420
It's just what we observe--
and this is actually

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:07.200
what would be predicted based
on the Big Bang-- is actually

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.551
microwave radiation.

00:09:08.551 --> 00:09:10.050
So anyway, hopefully,
that gives you

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.860
a sense of what redshift is.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:16.450
And now we can use
this tool to explain

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:19.180
why we think many, many things
are moving away from us.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:22.810
And now let me just actually
make sure you get that idea.

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:25.990
If I have two objects, let's
say that these are suns.

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:29.620
Let's say that these are
both suns, or both galaxies,

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:30.510
either way.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:32.000
And because of
other properties--

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.625
and I won't talk
about them right now--

00:09:33.625 --> 00:09:37.400
we know that they
are probably emitting

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.179
light of the same color.

00:09:39.179 --> 00:09:41.220
They're probably emitting
light of the same color

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:45.930
because we know other properties
of that star or of that galaxy.

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:48.080
Now, if what we
actually perceive

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.440
is that this one looks
redder to us than this one,

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.090
then we know that it is
traveling away from us.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:57.100
And the redder it looks,
the more its wavelength

00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:00.540
is spread out relative to this
other star, the faster we know

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:03.310
that this is moving
away from us.
