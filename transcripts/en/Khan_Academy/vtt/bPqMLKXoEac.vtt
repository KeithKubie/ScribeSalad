- [Voiceover] Hello grammarians.

00:00:01.154 --> 00:00:05.219
Welcome to one the thorniest
fights in English usage today.

00:00:05.219 --> 00:00:06.844
The question of whether
or not you should use

00:00:06.844 --> 00:00:10.761
who or whom in a sentence
as a relative pronoun.

00:00:10.761 --> 00:00:14.431
So there's this basic idea
that who is the subject form,

00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:16.590
and whom is the object form.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.182
Which means that if we're talking about

00:00:18.182 --> 00:00:21.862
someone who is the doer, then we say who.

00:00:21.862 --> 00:00:24.126
As in, the spy who loved me.

00:00:24.126 --> 00:00:26.986
As opposed to someone who
is the doee, the object.

00:00:26.986 --> 00:00:29.579
As in, the spy whom I loved.

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:32.098
You see, cause in this
sentence, who is the subject.

00:00:32.098 --> 00:00:34.351
And in this sentence, I is the subject.

00:00:34.351 --> 00:00:35.837
Me is the object.

00:00:35.837 --> 00:00:37.137
And whom is the object.

00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:39.250
I loved whom?

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.038
In this sentence, I am doing the loving.

00:00:41.038 --> 00:00:45.042
In this sentence it is the
spy who is doing the loving.

00:00:46.352 --> 00:00:48.703
That's the basic rule.

00:00:48.703 --> 00:00:51.043
But, this does not adequately reflect

00:00:51.043 --> 00:00:52.958
the way our culture actually uses

00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:56.383
and has used whom or who for some time.

00:00:56.383 --> 00:00:59.344
In many cases it has become permissible

00:00:59.344 --> 00:01:02.855
to use who as an object.

00:01:02.855 --> 00:01:04.858
Let me show you what I mean.

00:01:04.858 --> 00:01:05.950
So the thing to remember

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.956
is that the basic rule
is a one way street.

00:01:08.956 --> 00:01:11.035
Because the way language is changing,

00:01:11.035 --> 00:01:13.694
whom is on its way out.

00:01:13.694 --> 00:01:18.675
I imagine in another 50, 75
years we won't be using it all.

00:01:18.675 --> 00:01:19.812
Is that sad?

00:01:19.812 --> 00:01:21.252
Sure, a little bit.

00:01:21.252 --> 00:01:24.756
I mean I'm sad that nobody
every uses the pronoun whoso.

00:01:24.756 --> 00:01:29.619
As in, whoso pulleth this
sword from this stone,

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.606
is rightwise born king of England.

00:01:32.606 --> 00:01:33.814
We don't use that anymore.

00:01:33.814 --> 00:01:35.509
It's old fashioned.

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.784
Now we say, whoever.

00:01:37.784 --> 00:01:41.048
And that's ok.

00:01:41.048 --> 00:01:42.127
So we know that the basic rule

00:01:42.127 --> 00:01:44.147
is that you use who as a subject

00:01:44.147 --> 00:01:46.027
and whom as an object.

00:01:46.027 --> 00:01:49.406
Well you can also now
use who as an object.

00:01:49.406 --> 00:01:53.313
The only thing you can't do
is whom is not a subject.

00:01:56.443 --> 00:01:57.950
That's the thing you need to remember,

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.552
is that whom's use is not expanding.

00:02:00.552 --> 00:02:01.852
It is contracting.

00:02:01.852 --> 00:02:04.824
Who is taking over some of whom's duties.

00:02:04.824 --> 00:02:08.470
So let's go back to that spy example.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.152
So here are the four
possible options, right?

00:02:11.152 --> 00:02:13.010
The spy who loved me,

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.831
the spy whom loved me,

00:02:14.831 --> 00:02:16.586
the spy who I loved,

00:02:16.586 --> 00:02:18.512
and the spy whom I loved.

00:02:18.512 --> 00:02:23.029
Now of these, only this one is incorrect.

00:02:23.029 --> 00:02:26.326
Because we're trying to
use whom as a subject.

00:02:26.326 --> 00:02:28.230
But here, the spy who I loved,

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.983
where who is being an object,

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:33.885
by the informal rules of our
grammar today, this is fine.

00:02:33.885 --> 00:02:36.786
Either of these is fine.

00:02:36.786 --> 00:02:40.710
The only one that's not
fine is this guy right here.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.765
The spy whom loved me.

00:02:42.765 --> 00:02:45.831
Because this language change
is going in one direction.

00:02:45.831 --> 00:02:50.324
And it's in the direction of
whom being used less often.

00:02:50.324 --> 00:02:53.087
So whom never expands from
its original position.

00:02:53.087 --> 00:02:54.932
Who does.

00:02:54.932 --> 00:02:57.232
So the next time you're
puzzling over what to do

00:02:57.232 --> 00:03:00.249
in the event of the sentence
who are you talking to,

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:02.131
and whether or not this pronoun here

00:03:02.131 --> 00:03:05.184
should be who or whom,

00:03:05.184 --> 00:03:08.772
it's really an issue of tone
rather than correctness.

00:03:08.772 --> 00:03:13.277
Because both possibilies
are equally understandable.

00:03:13.277 --> 00:03:15.819
Yes, technically if you
wanted to be very correct

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.637
you would say whom are you talking to,

00:03:20.637 --> 00:03:24.854
or you are talking to whom,

00:03:24.854 --> 00:03:27.231
because whom is the object
of this preposition.

00:03:27.231 --> 00:03:30.747
It's to whom, and so therefore
we would use the object form.

00:03:30.747 --> 00:03:34.248
But you find that when you
separate it out in this question,

00:03:34.248 --> 00:03:36.673
when you put the to at the end,

00:03:36.673 --> 00:03:39.229
and the whom question
particle at the beginning,

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:41.191
this m just kind of falls away.

00:03:41.191 --> 00:03:43.628
Cause we're more likely to use whom

00:03:43.628 --> 00:03:47.008
when it's immediately
preceded by a preposition.

00:03:47.008 --> 00:03:51.547
But otherwise, it's probably
more likely gonna be who.

00:03:51.547 --> 00:03:54.032
Which is why it's not
that big of a deal to say

00:03:54.032 --> 00:03:55.553
who are you talking to.

00:03:55.553 --> 00:03:56.865
It's not technically correct,

00:03:56.865 --> 00:04:00.510
but it's been used for
so long that it's fine.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.309
You are talking to who

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:06.292
is a little bit more
formal of a construction,

00:04:06.292 --> 00:04:09.868
and therefore you would
probably want to use whom.

00:04:09.868 --> 00:04:14.591
Saying you are talking
to who is not as common.

00:04:14.591 --> 00:04:17.691
So in this wild swamp of rule breaking

00:04:17.691 --> 00:04:20.828
there is one hard grammar
rule to pay attention to.

00:04:20.828 --> 00:04:24.693
And it's just never use whom as a subject.

00:04:24.693 --> 00:04:28.628
The role of whom in our
constellation of pronouns

00:04:28.628 --> 00:04:31.149
is decreasing, not expanding.

00:04:31.149 --> 00:04:33.808
Who is taking over whom.

00:04:33.808 --> 00:04:35.572
And since who is the subject,

00:04:35.572 --> 00:04:38.172
whom is not moving into that space.

00:04:38.172 --> 00:04:40.066
Whom is the object pronoun,

00:04:40.066 --> 00:04:43.271
and you use it when you're feeling fancy.

00:04:43.271 --> 00:04:44.767
You can learn anything.

00:04:44.767 --> 00:04:45.817
David out.
