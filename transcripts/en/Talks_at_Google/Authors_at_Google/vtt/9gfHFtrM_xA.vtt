[? HEATH ROE: ?] Hello, my
name is Heath [? Roe, ?]

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.380
I'm Research Operations Manager
for the Insights Lab at Google,

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.010
and I want to thank you for
joining us today for Cory

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.150
Doctorow.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.910
Cory Doctorow is a science
fiction author, activist,

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.880
journalist, and blogger,
co-editor of Boing Boing

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.060
and author of many books,
including the nonfiction

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.130
business book,
"Information Doesn't

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.110
Want To Be Free,"
the young adult

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.580
novel, "Little Brother," and
his newest novel, "Walkaway."

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.680
He works for the Electronic
Frontier Foundation,

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.440
is an MIT Media Lab
research affiliate,

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.870
serves as a visiting professor
of computer science at Open

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.710
University, and co-founded
the UK Open Rights Group.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.560
Born in Toronto, Canada, Cory
now lives in Los Angeles--

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.140
Burbank, to be specific.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.780
He's here today to read from
and talk about "Walkaway,"

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.760
which has been described as
an optimistic disaster novel.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.920
I introduce to
you, Cory Doctorow.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.360
CORY DOCTOROW: Thanks, Heath.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.030
Thank you very much.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.510
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.950
I have a long and, largely,
fruitful association

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.236
with this firm.

00:01:11.236 --> 00:01:12.860
I remember going to
the first Christmas

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.799
party at what used to be
the SGI offices, and going,

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:17.590
I remember when these
were the SGI offices.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.507
So I've been around the
Googles for a long time,

00:01:22.507 --> 00:01:23.840
but I've never been to this one.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.220
You have very nice digs.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.910
I like your weird, Guggy
architecture out front.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.800
I'm going to read
to you a little bit

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.630
from this novel,
if I can figure out

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.730
where my standard reading is.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.730
I was on a 35-city
book tour where

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.730
I did this reading
at least once a day,

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.853
and was able to find the
section of the book like that.

00:01:43.853 --> 00:01:46.820
[SNAP] And you can tell
I'm out of practice, now,

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.200
because I had to do
that for a second.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.740
I'm going to read to you
a little bit from the book

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.520
and then, I will answer
any questions you have.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.710
And then, we can move on
to the ritual defacement

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.490
of books with sharpies.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.832
So that's the order
of service, here.

00:02:02.832 --> 00:02:04.790
The section I'm going to
read from chapter two.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.479
It's called, "You All
Meet in a Tavern."

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.120
"Sundays at the Belt and
Braces were the busiest,

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.891
and there was always
competition for the best jobs.

00:02:13.891 --> 00:02:15.890
The first person through
the door hit the lights

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.870
and checked the infographics.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.850
These were easy enough
to read that anyone can

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.980
make sense of them, even noobs.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.990
But Limpopo was no noob.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.270
She had more commits
into the Belt and Braces

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.240
firmware than anyone, an
order of magnitude lead

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.590
over the rest.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.340
It was technically in poor taste
for her to count her commits,

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.200
let alone keep a tally.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.650
In a gift economy, you
gave without keeping score,

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.230
because keeping score implied
an expectation of reward.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.200
If you did something
for reward, it

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.290
was an investment, not a gift.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.300
In theory, Limpopo agreed.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.940
In practice, it was
so easy to keep score,

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.340
the leaderboard
was so satisfying

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.380
that she couldn't help herself.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.350
She wasn't proud
of this, mostly.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.710
But this Sunday, first through
the door the Belt and Braces,

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.950
alone in the big common
room with its aligned rows

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.910
of tables and chairs, all the
infographic showing nominal,

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.490
she felt proud.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.670
She patted the wall with
a perverse, unacceptable

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.530
proprietary air.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.420
She'd helped build
the Belt and Braces,

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.470
scavenging the
Badlands for the parts

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.560
its drone outriders
had identified

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.360
for its construction.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.200
It was the project she'd
found her walkaway with,

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.960
the thing uppermost in her
mind when she'd looked around

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.010
the Badlands, set down her pack,
emptied her pockets of anything

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.980
worth stealing, put
extra underwear in a bag,

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.610
and walked out into
the Niagara escarpment,

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.740
past the invisible line
separating civilization from

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.060
no-man's-land, out of the world
as it was and into the world

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.390
as it could be.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.830
The codebase had originated
with the UN High Commission

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.940
on Refugees and had been
field-trialed a lot.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.140
You told it the building
you wanted, gave it

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.630
a scavenging range, and
it directed its drones

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.410
to inventory anything nearby,
scanning multi-band, doing

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.020
deep database scrapes
against urban planning

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.990
and building-code sources
to identify usable blocks

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.790
for whatever you were making.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.970
This was turned into a scavenger
hunt inventory, and refugees

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.490
or aid workers, or,
in shameful incidents,

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:22.850
the trafficked juveniles
slaves, fanned out

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.590
to retrieve the
pieces the building

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.100
needed to conjure
itself into existence.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.262
These flowed onto the job site.

00:04:30.262 --> 00:04:31.970
The building tracked
and configured them,

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.850
a continuously refactored
critical path for its

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.830
build plan that
factored in the skill

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.670
levels of the workers or the
robots on-site at any moment.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.610
The effect was something
like magic and something

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.860
like ritual humiliation.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.480
If you installed
something wrong,

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.550
the system tried to find
a way to work around

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.050
your stupid mistake.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.540
Failing that, the system
buzzed your haptics

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:54.890
with rising intensity.

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:59.000
And if you ignored them, it
tried optical and even audible.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.500
If you squelched
that, it started

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.585
telling the other humans
that something was amiss

00:05:02.585 --> 00:05:04.914
and instructed them to fix it.

00:05:04.914 --> 00:05:06.830
There had been a lot of
A/B splitting of this.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.440
It was there in the codebase
and the unit-tests for anyone

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.216
to review, and the most
successful strategy

00:05:12.216 --> 00:05:14.090
the buildings had found
for correcting humans

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.780
was to pretend that
they didn't exist.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.970
If you planted a piece
of structural steel

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.580
in a way the building
really couldn't work with

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.519
and ignored the rising
chorus of warnings,

00:05:24.519 --> 00:05:26.060
someone else would
be told that there

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.580
was a piece of
"misaligned" material

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.740
and tasked to it,
with high urgency.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.960
It was the same error
the buildings generated

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.700
if something slipped,
and it didn't

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.620
assume that a human
being had fucked up

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.020
through malice or incompetence.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.000
The initial theory
had been that an error

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.310
without a responsible
party would be more

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.050
socially graceful.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.079
People doubled down
on their mistakes,

00:05:47.079 --> 00:05:48.620
especially when they
were embarrassed

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.180
in front of their peers.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.310
The name-and-shame
alternate versions

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.530
had shown that
hot-cheeked fierce denial

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:58.210
was the biggest impediment
to standing up a building.

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.990
So if you fucked
up, soon someone

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.210
would turn up with a
[INAUDIBLE] or a forklift

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.190
or a screwdriver
and a job ticket

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.410
to unfuck the thing that
you were percussively

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.677
maintaining into submission.

00:06:09.677 --> 00:06:11.760
You could pretend that you
were doing the same job

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.890
as the new guy, part
of the solution instead

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:15.480
of the problem's cause.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.820
This like you save face so
that you wouldn't insist

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.080
that you were doing it
right and the building's

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.960
stupid instructions,
and everything else

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.780
in the universe, was wrong.

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:29.220
Reality was chewily weirder
in a way that Limpopo loved.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:32.880
It turned out that if you are
dispatched to defubar something

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.890
and found someone
who was obviously

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:38.190
the source of the enfubarage,
you could completely

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:41.160
tell that that structural
steel was not three degrees off

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.720
true because of slippage.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.270
It was three degrees off
true because some dipshit

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.380
flubbed it.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.470
What's more, Senor Dipshit
knew that you knew that he was

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:53.010
at fault. But the fact that the
trouble ticket read urgent--

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:56.220
retrue structural member minus
three degrees at 120 degrees

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.420
north-northeast,
and not, urgent--

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:01.440
retrue structural member minus
3 degrees and 120 degrees

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.570
north-northeast because
some dipshit can't follow

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:08.160
instructions, let both of you
do this mannered kabuki in which

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.880
you operated in the third
person passive voice--

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:17.290
the beam has become off-true,
not, you fucked up the beam.

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:20.770
That pretense-- the researchers
called it networked social

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.590
disattention, but everyone else
called it the how did that get

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:24.760
there affect--

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.690
had been a vital shift in the
UNHCR's distributed shelter

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:29.680
initiative.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.920
Prior to that, it had all
been gamified to fuckery,

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.650
with leaderboards for the most
correct installs and the best

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:36.650
looters.

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:41.260
Test builds were marred by angry
confrontations and fistfights.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.140
Even this could be a
virtue, since every build

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:46.780
would figure into a
two or three subgroups,

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.450
each putting up
their own buildings.

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:50.560
It was three for
the price of one.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.720
Inevitably, these
forked-off projects

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.000
would be less ambitious
than the original plan.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.330
So early sites had a
characteristic look--

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:02.230
a wide, flat, low building,
the first three stories

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.810
of something that had been
planned for 10 before half

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:06.040
the workers had quit.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.920
At 100 meters away,
three more buildings,

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.200
each half the size of
the first, representing

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.050
the forked and reforked
buildings-revenge

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:16.570
built by alienated splitters.

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:21.610
Some sites had Fibonacci
spirals of ever-smaller forks,

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:24.880
terminating in a single
hostility-radiating, hate-built

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.450
Wendy house.

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:31.350
The buildings made the leap from
the UNHCR repo to the walkways

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:33.960
and mutated into
innumerable variations

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:37.230
on the clinics-school-shelter
refugee trinity.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:40.679
The Belt and Braces was the
first tavern ever attempted.

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:42.570
Layouts for restaurant
Kitchens weren't

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:45.330
far off from camp kitchens,
and big commons spaces

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:48.780
were easy enough, but the
actual zeitgeist of the thing

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:52.290
was substantially different,
tweaked in 1,000 different ways

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:54.695
so that you would never
walk into it and say,

00:08:54.695 --> 00:08:57.330
huh, this is a refugee
residence that's been

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.750
converted into a restaurant.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:01.770
And you'd also never
mistake the Belt and Braces

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:03.330
for a normal restaurant.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.240
Its major feature was the
projection-mapped lighting

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.820
that painted surfaces and
items throughout its interior

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.850
with subtle red-green tones
indicating where something

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:13.530
needed human attention.

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:16.500
This was also UNHCR
playbook, but again, there

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.720
was a world of difference
between dishing up

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.120
MREs to climate
refuse and serving

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.630
fancy dry-ice cocktails made
from wet-printers and powdered

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:25.710
alcohol.

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:29.010
No refugee camp ever went
through quite so many cocktail

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:32.970
parasols and perfect-knots
swizzle sticks.

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:35.220
On an average day,
the Belt and Braces

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.320
served a couple
of hundred people.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.990
On Sundays, it
was more like 500.

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:41.640
The influx of noobs
brought scouts

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.460
for talent, sexual partners,
bandmates, playmates,

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.010
and, of course, victims.

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:48.510
Being the first one
through the door

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:51.840
meant that Limpopo would
get to play maitre d'.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.720
The assays showed that last
night's beer had come up well.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.190
The hydrogen cells
were running 45%,

00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:00.180
which would run the Belt and
Braces for two weeks flat out.

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:02.610
The eggbeaters on the roof
had been running hard,

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:04.530
electrolyzing waste
water and pumping

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:06.570
cracked hydrogen in the cells.

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:09.060
There were 50 cells in the
basement, harvested out

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.490
of abandoned jets the
drones had spotted.

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:14.160
The jets hadn't been
airworthy for a long time,

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.170
but had yielded
quantities of materiel

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:19.230
for the Belt and Braces,
including dozens of benches

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:20.760
made from their seats.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.400
The hard-wearing
upholstery had come clean,

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.220
its dirt-shedding
surfaces revealing designs

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:30.060
with each wipe of their rags
like re-appearing disappearing

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.530
ink.

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:34.080
But the hydrogen cells had
been the biggest find of all,

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.670
and without them,
the Belt and Braces

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:38.400
would have been very
different, prone to shortages

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.750
and brownouts.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:41.880
Limpopo fretted that
they'd be stolen.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.820
It took all her self-control
not to install surveillanceware

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.430
around all the utility hatches.

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:50.220
The pre-prep stuff on
the larders showed green,

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:52.920
but she still made a point of
personally sniffing the cheese

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:56.100
cultures and prodding the dough
through its kneading film.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.440
The sauce precursors
smelled tasty

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.690
and the ice cream maker
hummed as it lazily

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:04.050
aerated the frozen cream.

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:07.710
She called for coffium
and sat skewered

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:10.320
on a beam of light in
the middle of the commons

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:15.630
as the delicious, fruity, musky
aroma wafted into the room.

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:18.810
The first cup of coffium
danced hot in her mouth,

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:21.900
and its early-onset ingredients
percolated into her bloodstream

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:24.300
through the mucous
membranes under her tongue.

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:26.430
Her fingertips
and scalp tingled,

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:29.140
and she closed her eyes
to enjoy the effects

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:30.810
the second-wave
substances brought on

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:32.520
as her gut started to work.

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.980
Her hearing became preternatural
and the big muscles

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.740
in her quads and pecs and
shoulders got a fiery feeling,

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.530
like dancing while
standing still.

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:42.990
She took another deep
draft and closed her eyes.

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:47.250
And when she opened them
again, she had company.

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:49.860
They were such
obvious noobs, they

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.840
could have come from
central casting.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:55.680
Worse, they were shleppers,
their heavy outsized packs,

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.500
many-pocketed trekking
coats, and cargo pants

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.360
stuffed to bulging.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.430
They looked overinflated.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:05.190
Shleppers were neurotic
and probably destined

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:07.020
to walk back within
weeks, leaving

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:11.160
behind lingering interpersonal
upfuckedness in their wake.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.190
Limpopo had gone walkaway
the right way, with nothing

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:18.450
more than clean underwear, which
turned out to be superfluous.

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:21.300
She tried not to prejudge
these three, especially

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:25.110
in that giddy first five
minutes of her coffium buzz.

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:27.390
She didn't want him
harsh her mellow.

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:28.890
"Welcome to the B and B!"

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:31.200
she shouted, louder
than intended.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.970
They flinched and then rallied.

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:35.800
"Hi, there," the girl
said, and walked forward.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.480
Her clothes were beautiful,
bias-cut and contrast stitched.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.580
Limpopo immediately
coveted them.

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.860
She'd pull the girl's images
from the archives later

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:47.070
and decompose the patterns
and run a set for herself.

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:49.980
She'd be the envy of all who saw
her until the design propagated

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:51.600
and became old news.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.990
"Sorry to just walk in, but
we heard--" "You heard right."

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:57.960
Limpopo's voice was quieter,
but still too shouty.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.150
Either the coffium
had to burn down

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:02.100
so she could control
her affect, or she

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:05.850
needed to drink a lot more so
she could stop giving a shit.

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:09.030
She thumped the refill zone and
put her cup under the nozzle.

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:11.080
"Open to everyone,
all day, every day.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.770
But Sundays are special,
our way of saying hello

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:15.870
to our new neighbors and
getting to know them.

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:16.710
I'm Limpopo.

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:19.230
What do you want to be called?"

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:21.600
The phrasing was particular
to the walkaways,

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.600
an explicit invitation
to remake yourself.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.600
It was the height of
walkaway sophistication

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.869
to greet people with it, and
Limpopo used it deliberately

00:13:29.869 --> 00:13:31.410
on these three
because she could tell

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:33.729
that they were tightly wound.

00:13:33.729 --> 00:13:35.520
The shorter of the two
guys, with a scruffy

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:38.580
kinked beard and a stubbly
shaved head stuck his hand out.

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:40.320
"I'm Gizmo von Puddleducks."

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.110
This is Zombie
McDingleberry and Etcetera."

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:45.240
The other two rolled their eyes.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.520
"Thank you, Gizmo,
but actually, you

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.670
can call me Stable
Strategies," the girl said.

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:52.590
The other guy, tall
but hunched over

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:55.440
with an owlish expression and
exhaustion lines in his face,

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.520
sighed.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.710
"You might as well
call me Etcetera.

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:01.050
Thanks, Herr von Puddleducks."

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:02.615
"Very pleased to
meet," Limpopo said.

00:14:02.615 --> 00:14:04.740
"Why don't you put your
stuff down and grab a seat,

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:06.900
and I'll get you some coffium."

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:09.400
so that's the reading.

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:13.130
So "Walkaway," it's an
optimistic disaster novel.

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:14.590
That's what I call it.

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:18.360
And the thesis underlying
it is that you are not

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.970
a pessimistic person if you
assume something will go wrong

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:22.110
with a system.

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:24.270
Engineers who design
systems on the assumption

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:26.040
that nothing will ever go
critically wrong with them

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.090
don't make good systems.

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:29.160
They build the Titanic.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.800
And so optimism
is not the belief

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.260
that nothing will go wrong.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.540
Optimism is the belief
that we can design systems

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:38.760
that coast to a gentle
stop when they go wrong,

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.980
instead of exploding
and showering

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:43.380
all the people around them
with white hot shrapnel.

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:45.671
And it's the belief that once
they've posted to a stop,

00:14:45.671 --> 00:14:47.080
we can get them started again.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.610
And one of the initial
impetuses for writing this book

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:53.160
was another book, a history
book by a woman named

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.720
Rebecca Solnit.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.960
She's best known for coining
the term mansplaining.

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:00.690
But she came to do that
because she's an historian.

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:03.497
And she had written a
very well-regarded history

00:15:03.497 --> 00:15:05.580
book that had been written
up in "The New Yorker,"

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:08.340
and she was at a party at, I
think Park City at Sundance

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:11.892
or something, and she met
this millionaire blowhard who

00:15:11.892 --> 00:15:13.350
started telling
her about this book

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:16.080
that he'd read a review
of in "The New Yorker,"

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.844
and he was getting it wrong.

00:15:17.844 --> 00:15:18.510
It was her book.

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:20.340
And she kept saying,
I wrote that book.

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:24.450
And he would just continue to
talk about what the book was

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:26.910
about and what its thesis was,
and she kept saying, no, I

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:28.020
wrote that book.

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:30.750
And that's how she came to
coin the term mansplaining.

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:33.169
But the book that I'd read
that really impressed me--

00:15:33.169 --> 00:15:34.710
all of her books
are very impressive.

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:36.460
The one that really
impressed me is a book

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.040
called "A Paradise
Built in Hell,"

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.590
and it's a very closely
researched history

00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:44.580
of disasters, starting with the
1906 San Francisco earthquake,

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.770
and ending around
the Haiti earthquake.

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:50.400
And it explores the
gap between the way

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.410
that people on the
ground in disasters

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.722
experience them,
the way that people

00:15:54.722 --> 00:15:57.180
who are a little distant from
the disaster experience them,

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:59.820
and then the way that we
remember them in hindsight.

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:02.340
And her thesis is
that disasters,

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:05.190
although we often
depict them in the press

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:08.010
and think about them as
being the moment at which

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:11.735
the shackles of politesse
and decency are taken off,

00:16:11.735 --> 00:16:13.860
and you know, you run over
to your neighbor's house

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:15.965
and kill them, that
actually, disasters

00:16:15.965 --> 00:16:17.340
are experienced
by the people who

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:20.010
lived through them as the moment
when, like, the refrigerator

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:23.040
hum of background
petty grievance stops

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.660
and you realize
that you have more

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:26.400
in common with the
people across the road

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.170
than you have
differential from them.

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:30.128
And you go and start
digging through the rubble

00:16:30.128 --> 00:16:31.830
to rescue them, and
everyone pitches in.

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:33.780
And that people
often, in retrospect

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:36.140
remember disasters as
a very stressful time,

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:39.490
but as a time when their
faith in humanity was renewed.

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:42.300
But in between those
two things, this thing

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:45.480
that we remember in hindsight or
assume a priori about disasters

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:48.470
and the way people
lived through disasters,

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:51.840
is a third phenomenon, something
called elite panic, which

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:54.930
is the belief of the wealthy,
that when the lights go out,

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:56.700
the poor come in to get them.

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:59.700
And the way that that
manifests is often

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:02.820
with a kind of
preemptive strike to keep

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.819
the civil order that they know
will degenerate in the moment.

00:17:05.819 --> 00:17:07.800
And that this interferes
really greatly

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:11.670
with the ability of people to
get the machine started again.

00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:13.520
And the best example
of it from the book--

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.300
it's full of great
examples, but the one

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:18.660
that's most sort of
picture-perfect of this

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:20.819
is that after the
1906 earthquake,

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:23.670
General Funston marched his
troops out of the Presidio,

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:25.829
convinced of two
things, both of which

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:27.055
he was totally wrong about.

00:17:27.055 --> 00:17:28.680
The first was that
he understood enough

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:31.440
about controlled demolition
to build fire breaks,

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:35.089
and the second was that after
he'd set fire to San Francisco,

00:17:35.089 --> 00:17:36.630
that he couldn't
let poor people back

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:38.504
into the mission to
fight the fires that he'd

00:17:38.504 --> 00:17:39.810
started because they'd loot.

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:41.280
And that's how he
came to burn down

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.200
a quarter of San Francisco.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.700
And you know, you
really couldn't

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:50.190
ask for a better example of how
the conviction that the poors

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:55.620
are coming for you,
and an unwillingness

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:57.900
to trust people to recover
from their own disaster,

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.295
turns disaster into catastrophe.

00:18:00.295 --> 00:18:01.920
And I think some of
the blame for this,

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:04.230
at least in the
contemporary era,

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:06.690
can be placed at the feet
of pulp fiction, which

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:08.990
is a place where I'm
very comfortable to be.

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:10.920
I'm a pulp science
fiction writer.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:14.654
I write stories where the
plot is front and center.

00:18:14.654 --> 00:18:16.320
William Gibson gave
this great interview

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.861
to "The Paris Review" a couple
of years ago, where they said,

00:18:18.861 --> 00:18:21.090
like, do you ever meet
snooty literary professors

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:22.380
who turn their nose
up at you because you

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:23.296
write science fiction?

00:18:23.296 --> 00:18:24.840
He says, yeah, but
when that happens,

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:26.580
I just remind myself
that I'm a pulp

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:29.250
writer, a lineal descendant
of Dashiell Hammett.

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:33.030
By God, I can plot my fucking
wheel-- my fucking tractor has

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:34.350
wheels on it, right?

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:37.050
And I'm a pulp writer
and I love pulp stories.

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:40.620
And in a pulp story, you
always put the plot first.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.500
And you can ask the reader
to suspend their disbelief

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:44.986
in order to advance the plot.

00:18:44.986 --> 00:18:46.860
So we're all familiar
with this and the genre

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:48.030
of techno-thrillers, right?

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:49.830
In techno-thrillers,
anytime a computer

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:51.746
can do something
routinely that would

00:18:51.746 --> 00:18:53.370
make the plot less
interesting, we just

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:55.020
pretend the computer
can't do it.

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:56.970
And anytime there's something
that computers absolutely

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:59.261
can't do, but it'd be great
for the plot if they could,

00:18:59.261 --> 00:19:00.630
we just pretend they can.

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:04.540
And that kind of, like,
techno-metaphoric fiction

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:09.970
is a motif in a genre who's
central figure is the computer.

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:12.240
And yet computers are like
the least important thing

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:13.710
to how that genre works.

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:16.710
And I think in pulp fiction,
we like to get a twofer out

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:17.311
of disasters.

00:19:17.311 --> 00:19:18.810
We like to say,
well, why do we have

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:21.810
to choose between man versus
nature and man versus man?

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:23.602
Can't we have man versus
nature versus man?

00:19:23.602 --> 00:19:25.893
Can't the earthquake knock
your building down, and then

00:19:25.893 --> 00:19:27.545
your neighbors come
over to eat you?

00:19:27.545 --> 00:19:29.670
Right, because that does
make for an exciting plot.

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:32.070
I mean, I like "The
Walking Dead," too.

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:35.850
But the reality is that
that's not how it plays.

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:38.580
And I wrote this novel,
"Little Brother," 10 years ago,

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:43.590
in which I kind of took as my
central operating constraint

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:47.790
to write a story in which the
actual theoretical constraints

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:50.310
and capabilities of computers
would be the constraints

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:52.170
and capabilities of the plot.

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:54.420
And it turned out
that far from making

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:57.570
the story less interesting,
it gave it longevity, right?

00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:00.210
I wrote a story about
contemporary technology

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:03.170
in 2006-- it was
published in 2008--

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:05.009
that's still read today.

00:20:05.009 --> 00:20:07.050
Edward Snowden took a copy
of the sequel with him

00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:08.340
when he went on the run.

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:10.410
It's taught at the West
Point Cyber Institute

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:12.180
in their Digital
Insurgency program,

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:13.830
and at the Air Force Academy.

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:17.070
And the reason that
book still chimes today

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:19.890
is not because I'm a fortune
teller who knew how computers

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:21.130
would work in 10 years.

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:23.340
It's because the underlying
theory of computers

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:26.280
doesn't move that quickly.

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:29.190
Things that turn on things like
Turing completeness and Von

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:34.020
Neumann architectures and the
theoretical limits of crypto,

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:38.669
those are things that
retain their longevity.

00:20:38.669 --> 00:20:40.210
And in the same way,
I thought, well,

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:44.010
what would happen if I
wrote a disaster novel where

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:47.730
instead of shelving the
inconvenient truth that people

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:50.880
are mostly OK, and mostly
want to pitch in and help

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.399
their neighbors, I made that
the central tenant of the plot,

00:20:53.399 --> 00:20:55.440
and made the conflict not
that your neighbors are

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:58.740
total bastards, but that
it's possible for people

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:00.540
who like and even
love each other,

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:04.020
and who have the same goal about
getting the machine started

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:07.320
again, to have a totally
irreconcilable difference

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.025
about how to serve that goal.

00:21:09.025 --> 00:21:10.650
And the fights you
have with the people

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:13.842
you like and even love, they
are way more dramatic and harder

00:21:13.842 --> 00:21:15.300
to recover from
than the fights you

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:16.830
have with your mere enemies.

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:19.964
Like, win the argument over
the Christmas dinner table

00:21:19.964 --> 00:21:21.880
and you'll never be
invited back again, right?

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.240
It's the only thing more
traumatic than losing it.

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:27.342
And so I wrote this novel,
it's done really well.

00:21:27.342 --> 00:21:28.800
It's been out since
April, so now I

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.600
have a little bit of data on it.

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.240
It's sold really well on a
bunch of bestseller lists.

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:35.972
It's just been sold
into France and Germany

00:21:35.972 --> 00:21:37.180
and a bunch of other markets.

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:40.380
And I think that some of this is
attributable to this underlying

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:41.370
idea.

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:43.592
And more importantly,
I think it's

00:21:43.592 --> 00:21:46.050
a vision that, rather than
being optimistic or pessimistic,

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:47.377
is hopeful.

00:21:47.377 --> 00:21:49.710
And I think of being hopeful
as a fundamentally computer

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:51.762
science way of
looking at problems.

00:21:51.762 --> 00:21:54.220
So in computer science, we
often have intractable problems,

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:57.210
problems that scale
in geometric time,

00:21:57.210 --> 00:22:01.680
problems whose terrain
can't be fully known,

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.230
or whose terrain is dynamic
and changes during the course

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:05.670
of the problem solution.

00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:07.440
And in those instances,
we deploy things

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.750
like hill climbing,
where we don't

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:12.900
know how to get from A
to Z, and even if we did,

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:15.540
computing A to Z would be
a complete waste of time

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:18.390
because by the time we got
to B, the remaining terrain

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:20.160
would have reconfigured itself.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.840
This is why the
casualty of every battle

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.179
is the plan of attack.

00:22:23.179 --> 00:22:24.720
And so instead we
have hill climbing,

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:27.240
which basically says, if
you can think of one way

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:30.130
to materially improve your
situation apropo the problem,

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:31.200
take that step.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.390
Resurveil the landscape
immediately around you

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:35.830
and see if there's another
step that suggests itself.

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:38.010
And yeah, it can get
mired in local optima,

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:40.590
but it's the way that we solve
these really hard intractable

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:41.100
problems.

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:43.384
And hope is the
belief not that you

00:22:43.384 --> 00:22:45.300
know how to solve your
problem, but that there

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:47.049
is a thing you can do
that will materially

00:22:47.049 --> 00:22:48.600
improve your situation.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.030
And that from that new vantage,
there'll be another step

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:52.530
you can take.

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:55.170
It's why you tread water
when your ship sinks

00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:56.400
in the middle of the sea.

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.195
Not because you have a realistic
chance of being rescued,

00:22:59.195 --> 00:23:00.570
but because everyone
who was ever

00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:03.120
rescued treaded water
until help arrived, right?

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:07.200
It's the necessary, insufficient
precondition for survival,

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.100
is hope.

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:09.400
And so it's a hopeful book.

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:14.190
It's a book that implies that if
the situation seems intractably

00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:17.880
difficult, but you can find one
way to make it a little better,

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.110
that from there, you
might find another way.

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:23.040
And I think that's a much better
message than the message that

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.980
says that when disaster strikes,
your neighbors are coming over

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:28.290
with a shotgun, and so you're
a sucker if you go over

00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:30.690
to their house with
a covered dish.

00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:34.300
And in that regard, like
a lot of science fiction,

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:39.360
it's not just a pulp story to
help you traverse the long slog

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:42.300
from the cradle to the grave,
but it's also an intervention

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:45.030
in the world that
I hope plays out

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:47.680
in some meaningful
way in people's lives.

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:49.655
So with that, I'll
take your questions.

00:23:49.655 --> 00:23:51.030
Long rambling
statements followed

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:52.860
by "what do you think of that"
are technically questions,

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:53.943
but they're not good ones.

00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:59.580
Anyone have a question?

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:01.282
Yeah, go ahead.

00:24:01.282 --> 00:24:03.240
Are we recording these
and need to use the mic?

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:04.320
SPEAKER: Yeah-- [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.361
CORY DOCTOROW: All right.

00:24:05.361 --> 00:24:08.280
SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.632
CORY DOCTOROW: All right.

00:24:09.632 --> 00:24:11.596
AUDIENCE: So I have
quite a naive question.

00:24:11.596 --> 00:24:13.810
I'm very familiar reading
books, but it's always

00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:16.810
been a bit of a mystery
of how to write the book.

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:19.275
And maybe you can
describe your process?

00:24:19.275 --> 00:24:20.550
So is it--

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:23.910
I mean, set the alarm
clock and get up at eight

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:27.129
and start typing, or what are
the phases you go through?

00:24:27.129 --> 00:24:28.920
CORY DOCTOROW: I get
up at 8:00 on the days

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:29.850
I don't set the alarm.

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:30.558
I get up at 5:00.

00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:33.910
How do you write a book?

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:35.592
So there's an
aphorism about book

00:24:35.592 --> 00:24:37.050
writing that every
book teaches you

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:38.633
to write the book
you've just written,

00:24:38.633 --> 00:24:41.010
and there's definitely
something to that.

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:43.650
I'm a great believer in
separating composition

00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:45.315
from revision.

00:24:45.315 --> 00:24:47.700
That I think,
premature optimization,

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:52.950
premature refactoring is a huge
crisis in prose composition.

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:57.210
That it can really confound
your ability to work.

00:24:57.210 --> 00:25:00.480
I think that one of the
great mysteries of fiction

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.442
is why fiction is interesting.

00:25:02.442 --> 00:25:04.650
And this plays into both
reading and writing stories,

00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:07.961
because by definition, nothing
that happens in a book matters,

00:25:07.961 --> 00:25:08.460
right?

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:10.439
None of the people in
this book are real.

00:25:10.439 --> 00:25:12.480
So none of the things that
happen to them matter.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.197
The most tragic death you've
ever read in literature,

00:25:15.197 --> 00:25:17.280
you know, the death of
Romeo and Juliet-- spoiler,

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:18.690
they do die at the end--

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:21.810
that death is like, less
tragic than the death

00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:23.940
of the yogurt culture you
digested with breakfast

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:27.540
this morning because the
yogurt was actually alive

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:28.837
and now it's dead.

00:25:28.837 --> 00:25:30.420
Where as Romeo and
Juliet never lived.

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:32.040
So there's this weird
thing that happens

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:34.110
when we read a book we
have this limbic response.

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:34.710
We like cry.

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:35.270
We laugh.

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:40.230
We have this overall kind
of emotional involuntary

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:41.220
experience.

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:44.250
And I think the reason that
happens is that the way we

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:47.160
experience empathy for other
people, more generally,

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.694
is that when you first
get a piece of fragmentary

00:25:49.694 --> 00:25:52.110
information about a person--
it can be seeing that person,

00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:53.443
it could be hearing about them--

00:25:53.443 --> 00:25:55.470
you start to build up a model.

00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:58.230
And you revise that model
as new information comes in,

00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:00.870
and you use that model
as a predictive tool

00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:04.820
to understand whether
you can trust someone,

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:06.570
whether you want to
play with that person,

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:08.319
do stuff with that
person, whether they're

00:26:08.319 --> 00:26:09.600
your enemy or your friend.

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:12.210
And that it's by
imagining the things that

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:13.969
happen to the
person, by imagining

00:26:13.969 --> 00:26:16.260
them happening to the model,
that we experience empathy

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:16.759
for them.

00:26:16.759 --> 00:26:18.712
So you hear about someone
who broke their leg.

00:26:18.712 --> 00:26:19.920
You break the leg of a model.

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:21.836
You imagine how the model
would feel about it,

00:26:21.836 --> 00:26:23.130
then you feel that feeling.

00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:24.750
That's our interpretive process.

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:28.440
And I think when we read, we
build up models of people,

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.552
and then we subject them to
the traumas of the literature

00:26:31.552 --> 00:26:32.760
and we feel empathy for them.

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:37.110
I think it's an optical illusion
for our empathy, reading.

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:39.030
But there's a
corollary in writing

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:41.490
because when you start writing,
it can be embarrassing.

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:43.320
It's like you're doing a
puppet show for yourself.

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:44.861
Like, hey, guys,
let's go on a quest.

00:26:44.861 --> 00:26:47.040
That sounds great, here we go.

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.540
And it feels super artificial.

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:52.930
It feels like you
are making up stuff.

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:54.336
It feels like artifice.

00:26:54.336 --> 00:26:55.710
But then there's
a point at which

00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:58.680
the story kind of-- the
engine catches and it

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:02.757
starts to plot itself through
a largely unconscious process.

00:27:02.757 --> 00:27:04.590
And that's really
important at novel-lengths

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:07.410
because generally, the moving
parts in a novel-length novel

00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:09.180
are more than you could
consciously hold in your head

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:09.990
at any given time.

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:13.251
There's a lot of intuitive
work that goes on there.

00:27:13.251 --> 00:27:15.000
And I think that the
way that that happens

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.940
is exactly the same
process as reading.

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:21.600
So I knew a guy at summer
camp, when I was about 14,

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:25.980
who had started having seizures
when he was about two years old

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:28.410
and already had profound
brain damage when I met him.

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:30.060
And I knew him at
the end of his life.

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:33.030
And in a last ditch
effort to save his life

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:34.680
and stop the seizures
from spreading

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.670
from one hemisphere of
his brain to the other,

00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:38.460
they severed his
corpus callosum, right?

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:39.918
And so this is the
bundle of nerves

00:27:39.918 --> 00:27:42.010
that join the two
hemispheres of your brain.

00:27:42.010 --> 00:27:43.634
So now the two
hemispheres of his brain

00:27:43.634 --> 00:27:45.477
became non-routable
to one another.

00:27:45.477 --> 00:27:47.310
And this has this really
interesting effect,

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:49.620
in addition to being sort
of grisly and terrible--

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:53.700
you could hold something up
and if he saw it with one eye,

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:56.280
he could tell you what it was,
but not what it was called.

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.435
And if he saw it
with the other eye,

00:27:57.435 --> 00:27:59.040
he could tell you what it was
called, but not what it was.

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:01.500
But here's the cool
part-- when he said it,

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:04.770
because both of his ears
heard it, he then knew.

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:08.340
He had created a free
space, acoustic link that

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:11.100
was this very
slow-high latency bus

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:13.950
to replace the extremely
high-low latency electric bus

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:17.040
that normally join the two
hemispheres of his brain.

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.980
I think when you
write, you have words

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:21.720
show up on the
screen that are words

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:23.970
that you are
consciously thinking of.

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:26.820
But then, they are routed
to the part of your brain

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:29.460
that automatically,
involuntarily

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:31.950
takes input from the
environment and uses

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:34.020
it to build models of people.

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:37.350
And in these two normally
non-routable parts

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:40.690
of your brain, start to
interact with each other.

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:43.260
And as you put the
words down, you

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:47.610
start to get insight,
without conscious effort,

00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:49.740
into what the characters
are going to do.

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:53.252
And like, from a Claude Shannon
perspective, it makes no sense.

00:28:53.252 --> 00:28:54.960
Like, you're basically
making information

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:56.520
where no information exists.

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.030
I think it's
basically signal loss

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:00.500
is turning into information.

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:03.290
It's just noise that you
interpret as information.

00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:06.350
You're basically breathing
your own farts, right?

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:09.200
So this is the amazing thing
is when you start writing,

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.000
if you stay at it
long enough, then

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.830
the story starts to tell itself.

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:15.230
But when you go
back and refactor,

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:18.800
which is this hugely
compelling temptation

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:22.389
because you are a Wile E. Coyote
and you've run off the cliff

00:29:22.389 --> 00:29:23.180
edge at this point.

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:25.740
You're no longer consciously
in control of the whole thing,

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:28.010
and some part of you
knows that it's not there,

00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:30.140
and you want to
retreat to the safety

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:31.400
of the edge of the cliff.

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.070
And if you do that,
what you do is

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:36.140
you remind this
part of your brain

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:38.600
that's automatically
and voluntarily creating

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:41.120
the model that's helping
you write the book that it's

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:42.840
been on a fool's errand.

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:46.490
That there is no person there,
like one of those internet

00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:48.320
hoaxes about a kid
who's dying of cancer

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:51.587
and you get all these
heart-rending letters

00:29:51.587 --> 00:29:53.420
from the kid, and then
it all just turns out

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:56.300
to be this like
dude in Topeka who's

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:58.700
been like pretending to be
the kid for all the years.

00:29:58.700 --> 00:29:59.787
It's one of those, right?

00:29:59.787 --> 00:30:02.120
And then you're like, oh, I
got a scratch out the model.

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:04.070
Well, then you're
back to a puppet show.

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:07.190
So one of the things I
do is I don't revise.

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:08.984
I write every day.

00:30:08.984 --> 00:30:10.400
I used to write
seven days a week.

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:13.000
When I became a
father, I made it five.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.810
And I pick a word count to
write that day, every day--

00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:21.127
a standard unit of work that
reflects the other stuff going

00:30:21.127 --> 00:30:21.710
on in my life.

00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:24.504
The minimum is about
a page, so 250 words.

00:30:24.504 --> 00:30:26.420
The most I've ever done
is eight pages a day--

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:28.040
2,000 words a day.

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:32.060
And when I start when I
hit the limit, I stop.

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:33.506
And I stop mid-sentence.

00:30:33.506 --> 00:30:35.630
That lets you write two or
three words the next day

00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:36.810
without having to be creative.

00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:38.480
It's like parking a
manual transmission

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.440
on a downhill slope.

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:43.370
Like, it'll roll itself into
gear before you start writing.

00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:47.150
The heuristic for plotting,
especially a pulp novel,

00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:49.340
is you have a person in a
place with a problem who's

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:50.797
trying intelligently
to solve it,

00:30:50.797 --> 00:30:52.380
failing through no
fault of their own,

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:54.030
such that things get worse.

00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:55.820
We are a nosy species.

00:30:55.820 --> 00:31:00.740
We like to watch other
people solve their problems.

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:04.910
If you believe in
unfalsifiable hypotheses

00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:06.740
from evolutionary
biology, maybe that's

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:10.891
because it lets us get a preview
into what strategies might work

00:31:10.891 --> 00:31:12.140
if we experience that problem.

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:14.027
But it's definitely
a thing, that humans

00:31:14.027 --> 00:31:15.860
find it hard to look
away from someone who's

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:18.620
solving a problem, especially
if they're just plausibly trying

00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:22.460
to solve a problem, and it's not
clear what the outcome will be.

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:24.200
When they fail to
solve the problem

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:25.700
and the problem
gets worse, you have

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:28.670
rising tension, rising stakes,
and a new problem for them

00:31:28.670 --> 00:31:29.359
to solve.

00:31:29.359 --> 00:31:31.400
If you do that long enough,
eventually the stakes

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.491
reach a limit, and
that's a climax.

00:31:33.491 --> 00:31:35.240
And then you write a
little bit afterwards

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:37.406
called the denouement, which
is kind of the settling

00:31:37.406 --> 00:31:38.424
down period at the end.

00:31:38.424 --> 00:31:39.590
And then you're done, right?

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:40.590
That's a novel.

00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:43.130
And so that's the way that
you can heuristically write

00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:45.120
a couple of pages every day.

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:47.540
Refactoring at the
end is a combination

00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:48.760
of a lot of different things.

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:51.987
One is an editorial
note from your editor

00:31:51.987 --> 00:31:53.070
who tells you about stuff.

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:53.944
One is going through.

00:31:53.944 --> 00:31:56.370
I leave myself notes
in the manuscript.

00:31:56.370 --> 00:31:58.790
Go back and fix this
later, in square brackets.

00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:00.560
You go back and fix that stuff.

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:03.810
Using those notes rather
than stopping to do it.

00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:07.400
And especially, using it
rather than researching.

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.275
Like, you know when you
have someone standing

00:32:09.275 --> 00:32:11.650
at the end of the Brooklyn
Bridge, and you want to write,

00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:14.090
he contemplated the Brooklyn
Bridge, all TK feet of it.

00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:15.622
All blank feet of it.

00:32:15.622 --> 00:32:17.330
You can go to Wikipedia
and look that up.

00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:19.220
That's one Google query.

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:22.100
But then you will end up
in a Wikipedia click trance

00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:25.290
that you might not emerge
from for half a day.

00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:27.680
And so writing TK, it just
keeps you in the zone.

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:29.430
So you go back, you
fix all of that stuff.

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:30.513
You get an editorial note.

00:32:30.513 --> 00:32:32.540
You fix anything you've
left yourself notes on.

00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:35.060
And then with this
one, I did something

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:40.130
that was really about practice
that I'd evolved through some

00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:41.290
of the internet stuff I do.

00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:44.672
So I have glibness privilege.

00:32:44.672 --> 00:32:46.130
I'm good at putting
words together.

00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:49.010
My sentences read really nicely,
usually on the first pass.

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:52.280
I don't do a lot of line
editing when I write.

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:56.630
And what I'd worked out
is that over the years,

00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:58.220
I'd spent a lot
of time just sort

00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:01.100
of making my sentences shinier.

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:03.722
And if you're pretty
good already at that

00:33:03.722 --> 00:33:05.180
and you work really
hard at it, you

00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:08.810
might get from like 95%
proficiency to 95.5%

00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:10.790
proficiency.

00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:12.510
And when I was done
with this book,

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:15.740
I had been, in the interim,
using Twitter a lot.

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:19.640
And also, we had changed the
way that we did article displays

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:20.270
on Boing Boing.

00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:25.400
We started doing leads in and
breaks with click-throughs,

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.650
which in the early days of
blogging, you never did, right?

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:31.100
It was all full
post on the page.

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:34.700
So I had to start writing these
super compact summaries that

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:36.140
would go above the fold.

00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:38.990
So between tweeting and
that, I got really good

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:42.605
not just at sentences that read
well, but sentences that where

00:33:42.605 --> 00:33:44.264
as compact as possible.

00:33:44.264 --> 00:33:45.680
So when I was done
with this book,

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:48.355
every day for about a month,
I took 5,000 words out

00:33:48.355 --> 00:33:50.480
of the book, put them in
a new text editor window--

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:52.760
I just write in gedit on Ubuntu.

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:55.460
It's just Emacs keybindings,
plain text editor.

00:33:55.460 --> 00:34:00.440
And I went through and I nuked
1,000 words out of the 5,000

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.980
words on a sentence-by-sentence
basis until it was super tight.

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:06.552
And I cut like 20% of
the length of the book

00:34:06.552 --> 00:34:08.260
without making a single
substantive edit.

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:10.219
It was all at the
line-edit level.

00:34:10.219 --> 00:34:12.020
And I realized that
if you take something

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:14.069
that you're, like,
20% proficient at,

00:34:14.069 --> 00:34:15.860
and you work really
hard at it over a book,

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:17.719
you can go to 50% proficient.

00:34:17.719 --> 00:34:19.790
That there's so
many dividends to be

00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:25.110
paid at enduring the kind
of like less emotionally

00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:27.110
satisfying work of doing
something you're really

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:29.960
good at, and instead focusing
your attention on things

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:31.840
that you kind of suck at.

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:33.797
And that produced this
spectacular dividend

00:34:33.797 --> 00:34:35.630
that, I think, made
this book a better book.

00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:37.280
And the new book I'm
writing is even tighter.

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.840
And it's coming out
tight as I write it,

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.880
because that's what happens
when you get good at stuff

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:42.713
is you don't have to
think about it anymore.

00:34:42.713 --> 00:34:45.330
It becomes just a thing
that happens automatically.

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:48.524
So let's see--
all of that stuff.

00:34:48.524 --> 00:34:50.690
I want to say there is
another important composition

00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:51.514
note in there.

00:34:51.514 --> 00:34:52.639
So yeah, I write every day.

00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:54.824
I write wherever I happen to be.

00:34:54.824 --> 00:34:57.490
When it's a small chunk, you can
kind of do it wherever you are.

00:34:57.490 --> 00:34:58.970
I wrote today's
chunk of the book

00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:02.325
I'm working on in
the Lyft over here.

00:35:02.325 --> 00:35:03.950
I wrote the sequel
to "Little Brother,"

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:06.127
I wrote "Homeland"
while touring Germany.

00:35:06.127 --> 00:35:08.460
And I would go to like, four
gymnasiums-- high schools--

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:10.670
a day, and then do a
bookstore in the evening.

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:12.299
And I was touring
with my translator,

00:35:12.299 --> 00:35:14.090
so he would read in
German for half an hour

00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:15.380
and I'd read in English
for half an hour.

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:17.922
And I'd sit next to him on the
stage while he read in German.

00:35:17.922 --> 00:35:20.130
Well, first of all, all the
kids spoke better English

00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:22.501
than I did because they go
through the German education

00:35:22.501 --> 00:35:23.000
system.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.981
But also, I not only had already
heard him read this in German

00:35:26.981 --> 00:35:28.730
and didn't speak German,
but I'd heard him

00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:29.770
read it three times that day.

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:31.894
So I started writing the
sequel to "Little Brother"

00:35:31.894 --> 00:35:32.720
on the stage.

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:35.450
Which at first, I was like,
is that going to be rude?

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:36.680
But then the kids would
go like, (GERMAN ACCENT)

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:38.150
hey, Doctor-professor
Doctorow, what are you

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:39.080
doing on the stage?

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:40.490
And I would say, well,
I'm writing is equal

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:41.000
to "Little Brother."

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000
And they'd go, (GERMAN
ACCENT) Oh, it's so cool.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.980
And so once you have
the method down,

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:48.020
you can kind of do
it wherever you are.

00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:50.360
And at 2,000 words a
day, I wrote that book

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:54.230
in six weeks, which was
six weeks well-spent--

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:57.270
a little exhausting, but
six weeks well-spent.

00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:58.355
Any other questions?

00:35:58.355 --> 00:35:58.980
Yeah, go ahead.

00:36:02.795 --> 00:36:04.670
AUDIENCE: I have a
process question in regard

00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:08.000
to writing for different media.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.170
On your blog, you talked about
writing for some of the Disney

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:14.840
ghost-post assets
within a story box

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:16.250
that were sort of in-universe.

00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:19.850
So how do you approach writing
an in-universe artifact rather

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:21.379
than, like, traditional prose?

00:36:21.379 --> 00:36:23.420
CORY DOCTOROW: Yeah,
writing the ghost-post stuff

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:24.390
was really interesting.

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:26.000
So for those of
you who don't know,

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:31.620
Disney R&amp;D decided to
experiment with Loot Crates,

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:33.980
where you get a
subscription to merchandise

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:35.800
that comes every month.

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:37.820
And they wanted to do
them with a story that

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:40.210
ran through them, so like
a series of Loot Crates

00:36:40.210 --> 00:36:43.040
with a story that ran through
them with custom bespoke,

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:47.240
low-run, limited edition
merchandise in them

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:49.531
that was related to some
Disney franchise or another.

00:36:49.531 --> 00:36:51.530
And they prototyped it
with The Haunted Mansion.

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:53.480
They did 999 of them.

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:54.930
And I was the lead writer.

00:36:54.930 --> 00:36:56.780
There was one
other writer on it.

00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:58.660
And so the assets that I wrote--

00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:00.260
it's was much more
like show writing.

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:02.990
So I worked in Imagineering
off and on as a contractor.

00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:06.590
And show writing, it's stuff
like writing the signs,

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:09.957
writing the recorded
announcements.

00:37:09.957 --> 00:37:11.540
Like if you've been
on the Jungle Boat

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:17.330
Cruise, the announcer who
speaks between the songs that

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:19.490
is supposed to be in
the 1930s, a radio

00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:25.190
DJ in the 1930s telling you
about the riverboat cruise.

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:29.420
And so those assets, it's a
different kind of writing.

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:31.260
I wrote a couple of newspapers.

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:32.900
I wrote a ton of classified ads.

00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:33.890
I wrote letters.

00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:37.310
I wrote radio plays.

00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:39.770
And they had these
formal characteristics,

00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:43.190
which is that they all had to
tell this overarching story

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:44.450
that was a mystery.

00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:47.231
And so there were elements that
couldn't be revealed in them.

00:37:47.231 --> 00:37:48.980
There were things that
had to be held back

00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:50.840
and they had to be
subsequently revealed.

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:52.850
And you had to have a sense
of how they all went together.

00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:54.475
And I had a really
good project manager

00:37:54.475 --> 00:37:56.210
on it, this woman,
Sarah Thatcher,

00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:57.410
who put it all together.

00:37:57.410 --> 00:37:59.540
Oh, and incidentally, I'm
allowed to tell you this,

00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:00.800
unlike all of the
other work I've

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:03.470
ever done for Disney, because it
won Themed Entertainment Award,

00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:05.390
and they put all the
contractors names on it,

00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:07.850
so it released me from
my non-disclosure.

00:38:07.850 --> 00:38:09.470
So I can tell you
I worked on this.

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:15.200
And so Sarah had
great spreadsheets

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:19.800
of what information needed to be
conveyed in different contexts.

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:22.940
And then in terms of the canon--

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:25.469
so first of all, I'm a
giant Haunted Mansion nut.

00:38:25.469 --> 00:38:27.260
I was bitten by
radioactive Haunted Mansion

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:29.390
when I was 16 years old.

00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:31.880
And so I know a lot of
the canon in my head,

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:34.220
but then all of that
stuff is on wikia, right?

00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:38.180
Like the Disney Wikia Haunted
Mansion fandom is hardcore,

00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:41.720
and they have resolved
all the canon.

00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:43.590
And they've also,
like, marked out where

00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:47.810
they're irreconcilable,
mutually non-routable canon,

00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:51.770
like the Kitchen Sink comic
books versus the Marvel comic

00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:53.150
books versus the thing--

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:56.270
there was a thing that the cast
members, the Haunted Mansion

00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:58.450
employees in Florida
used to have,

00:38:58.450 --> 00:39:00.950
called The Ghost Gallery, which
was just a three-ring binder

00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:02.780
full of lore they'd written.

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:05.600
And that's found its way
online, some of which has been

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:07.100
formalized and some
of which hasn't.

00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:10.220
Like a lot of the names of
the ghosts in the ride were

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:13.640
actually made up by cast members
and written down in the lore,

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:16.340
and then passed down into
the Kitchen Sink Press comics

00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:19.700
and the movie with Wallace
Shawn and Eddie Murphy--

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:22.040
which was a terrible
movie, unfortunately--

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:23.460
and what have you.

00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:27.020
So I would sit down
and say, OK, this

00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:29.300
has this formal thing it
needs to do, which is rare

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:31.340
in a novel.

00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:33.770
Novels are way
less purpose-built.

00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:35.787
They're way less like,
this is a carburetor

00:39:35.787 --> 00:39:38.120
and it does this thing, and
if it doesn't do this thing,

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:40.170
then it is not
serving its purpose.

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:41.390
And if it does anything
more than this thing,

00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:43.056
then we should take
that other thing out

00:39:43.056 --> 00:39:45.800
and put it into another
part that's machined for it.

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:48.560
It's not like
modular code, right?

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:51.020
It's a lot more blended,
a lot more kind of

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:53.910
federated and
inter-twingled than that.

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:57.050
But in this case, everything
had a clean purpose.

00:39:57.050 --> 00:40:01.050
And so once I served that
purpose, I could really play.

00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:03.050
And moreover, I could--

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:05.210
because I knew with the
whole structure was,

00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:07.820
I could add elements
that I knew I could pick

00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:09.570
up later in other elements.

00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:10.246
So it was fun.

00:40:10.246 --> 00:40:12.620
It was a lot more like writing
an ARG, I think, would be.

00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:14.160
I've never done any ARG-writing.

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:15.350
But I think that's
what it would be like.

00:40:15.350 --> 00:40:16.087
AUDIENCE: It is.

00:40:16.087 --> 00:40:17.920
CORY DOCTOROW: Yeah,
is that what it's like?

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:20.000
Yeah, I think with
ARGs, the difference

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.920
is that with ARGs,
you get to play

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:26.120
with the players theories, the
fan theories, and wrap them in.

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:26.860
So when I talk--

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:30.260
like Maureen McHugh
talks about this with I

00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:32.990
Love Bees, that they
had code fragments.

00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:38.270
And the users inferred a Turing
complete programming language

00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:40.040
from the code fragments,
which they then

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:43.310
used to write all their
remaining code fragments.

00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:45.380
So they just threw
in some garbage code

00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:48.404
and then the users inferred the
entire programming environment.

00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:52.654
Any other questions?

00:40:52.654 --> 00:40:53.153
Heath?

00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:57.590
AUDIENCE: So the
last year has been,

00:40:57.590 --> 00:41:00.006
depending on how you look at
it, either a really good year

00:41:00.006 --> 00:41:01.880
for disasters, or
a really bad year.

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:04.040
Most recently, we've had
Texas we have Florida,

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.650
other places around the world.

00:41:05.650 --> 00:41:07.580
And LA, depending on
how you look at it,

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:09.800
is a really good city
for disasters, also.

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.840
We've got fire, we've got mud.

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:13.840
We've got the earthquakes.

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:16.330
You've lived here,
now, a couple of years.

00:41:16.330 --> 00:41:19.690
How has LA fit into your
writing or your storytelling

00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:21.520
at all, if it has?

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:26.110
And what do you think the
future, optimistic or otherwise

00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:28.522
is, for where we are right now?

00:41:28.522 --> 00:41:31.780
CORY DOCTOROW: Wow, well, so
I had written a bunch of stuff

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:34.510
that's set in and
around LA, especially

00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:36.340
in the San Fernando Valley.

00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:39.550
I find it really
fascinating around there.

00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:43.570
It's such a poster child
for different kinds

00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:46.090
of ambitious Americanism--

00:41:46.090 --> 00:41:50.170
car culture, Lockheed Martin.

00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:53.660
It's where you go to
live the American dream

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:54.535
and have a big house.

00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:00.940
Burbank is this really
weird city in that it's

00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:02.950
like completely run by itself.

00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:05.770
It's not part of the city of
LA, although it's in LA county.

00:42:05.770 --> 00:42:08.350
And it's the spectacularly
well-run city where all

00:42:08.350 --> 00:42:10.750
the services are like--

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:14.957
it's like being in like an
episode of "Father Knows Best."

00:42:14.957 --> 00:42:17.290
The fire department is full
of friendly efficient dudes,

00:42:17.290 --> 00:42:19.870
and so is the water and
power department, and so

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:22.540
are their garbage men,
and are the schools.

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:24.010
And the houses all
look like b-roll

00:42:24.010 --> 00:42:25.676
from "Father Knows
Best," because that's

00:42:25.676 --> 00:42:29.140
where they shot the b-roll
for "Father Knows Best," so

00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:31.184
thinking about how that
lives in the 21st century

00:42:31.184 --> 00:42:32.350
has been really interesting.

00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:35.560
I just wrote a ton of
stuff for a TV pitch

00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:39.130
that a studio put
together with Alex Gibney,

00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:42.790
about machine learning
and its future.

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:45.580
And I wrote these fiction
sequences where I set it

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:47.320
all in the San Fernando Valley.

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:49.720
And it was about things like
the future self-driving cars

00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:51.850
in a place that's designed
around the automobile

00:42:51.850 --> 00:42:53.810
and the future of
work automation

00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:56.500
in a place where all of
the white collar jobs

00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:57.970
are super automatable.

00:42:57.970 --> 00:42:59.740
They're things like
insurance adjuster

00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:02.350
and a bunch of
low-level health stuff,

00:43:02.350 --> 00:43:03.850
like that we have
these giant health

00:43:03.850 --> 00:43:06.280
centers where 85% of the
stuff that's done there

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:08.530
is super routinized.

00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:10.540
And it's just such
a ground zero for it

00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:12.625
and such ground zero
for weird politics,

00:43:12.625 --> 00:43:14.080
where there are these--

00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:17.410
although LA, as a city,
a coastal city in the US,

00:43:17.410 --> 00:43:20.130
is pretty blue--

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:22.540
the San Fernando Valley
is full of some deep red.

00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:24.520
And so you know what
does that look like?

00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:26.710
And what does austerity
look like in a city

00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:27.640
that doesn't have it?

00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:30.850
And because it's also a
cheap place and an edge city,

00:43:30.850 --> 00:43:33.410
it's full of people
who have less money.

00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:36.920
So it's much more diverse
than you'd expect, as well.

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:38.560
And then the last
thing that it has,

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:41.260
that I think all of
LA benefits from,

00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:45.040
is the upside of sprawl,
which is that sprawl means

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:48.040
that somewhere
that you can reach,

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:50.260
there is a storefront
that is for rent

00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:54.100
so cheaply, that no idea how
matter how weird or dumb it is,

00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:55.510
can't get a shot.

00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:57.510
Whereas like New
York, it's like there

00:43:57.510 --> 00:44:00.080
are three kinds of businesses
that you can have in New York--

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:04.960
there's a bodega, there is a
CVS, and there's a bank, right?

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:07.330
And it's like the
recycled backgrounds

00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:10.930
of "Flintstones" cartoons
now, walking through midtown--

00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:14.350
just the same five stores
over and over and over again.

00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:16.750
Whereas if you've lived
in LA for any time,

00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:19.150
you know that every neighborhood
gets a sushi joint that

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:20.860
would have a Michelin
star in a strip

00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:24.760
mall between a vaping store
and a Mail Boxes Et Cetera

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:27.320
that just the locals know about.

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:31.480
And so that is the
plus and minus.

00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:34.300
In terms of the future
of LA, I don't know.

00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:37.360
I mean, we're looking to
buy a house in Burbank,

00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:41.515
and LA being in the midst
of the same housing bubble

00:44:41.515 --> 00:44:44.140
that all the great cities are in
the middle of, we keep getting

00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:44.640
outbid.

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:47.500
So we're driving around to
a house viewing this summer,

00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:50.740
and my wife, who's
British, says, so

00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:53.950
what's the earthquake
stuff like in Burbank?

00:44:53.950 --> 00:44:56.590
We're like away from the main
part of the earthquakes, right?

00:44:56.590 --> 00:44:58.820
I'm like, well,
let's have a look.

00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:00.160
So I Google it.

00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:04.010
We are, like, on the San Andreas
fault. That's in our house,

00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:04.510
right?

00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:07.444
And then there's like three
more immediately next to us.

00:45:07.444 --> 00:45:09.610
And you kind of just got
to take them at their word.

00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:12.430
I moved to San Francisco
right after Loma Prieta,

00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:14.200
when all of the
retrofitting was going

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:15.783
on in the middle of
the dotcom bubble.

00:45:15.783 --> 00:45:19.351
So every dotcom was renting
spectacularly expensive

00:45:19.351 --> 00:45:21.850
real estate in a building that
was a construction zone where

00:45:21.850 --> 00:45:24.040
they were putting
up cantilevered Xs

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:26.624
the entire length of it, that
no one knew whether they'd work.

00:45:26.624 --> 00:45:29.123
And I think we still don't know
whether they'll work, right?

00:45:29.123 --> 00:45:31.480
I think a lot of The Big
One seismic retrofitting

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:34.210
is based on super
theoretical models.

00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:37.330
And even when we
test those models,

00:45:37.330 --> 00:45:40.120
we make assumptions about
the material properties

00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:43.087
of older buildings that
are really unwarranted.

00:45:43.087 --> 00:45:44.920
We say, well, that's a
wooden building built

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:47.692
with timbers in 1925.

00:45:47.692 --> 00:45:49.400
We know what the
properties of those are.

00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:52.240
But we are assuming a
perfectly spherical cow

00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:55.060
of uniform density on
a frictionless surface.

00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:59.530
They did not have uniform
building inspection in 1925.

00:45:59.530 --> 00:46:02.044
They used bubble gum and spit
just like everybody else.

00:46:02.044 --> 00:46:04.210
And so even though we go,
oh, that's been brought up

00:46:04.210 --> 00:46:05.654
to code with seismic
retrofitting,

00:46:05.654 --> 00:46:07.570
the assumptions about
the underlying materials

00:46:07.570 --> 00:46:11.696
and construction
techniques are--

00:46:11.696 --> 00:46:13.570
we all know that they're
totally unwarranted.

00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:15.320
We know that if you
ripped up the drywall,

00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:17.950
you'd find studs that were just
not nailed to anything, just

00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:18.700
sitting there.

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:21.470
That someone was like, eh.

00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:23.740
I mean, we've all
been there, right?

00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:25.360
So I don't know.

00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:27.300
I don't know what the
hell's going to happen

00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:28.860
when The Big One comes.

00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:30.075
It scares the shit out of me.

00:46:30.075 --> 00:46:32.200
And we just had a huge fire
in Burbank where we all

00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:35.230
had to stay indoors.

00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:40.660
The one thing I do hope is that
given how collegial Burbank is,

00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:41.410
and it is--

00:46:41.410 --> 00:46:43.960
our neighborhood is super
walkable and it's full

00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:45.610
of people who know each other--

00:46:45.610 --> 00:46:49.870
that the resilience is
there in time of crisis.

00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:53.950
Like, Bug Out Bags are
for cowards, right?

00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:57.190
Like, if your first
reaction to the disaster

00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:59.440
is to run for the hills,
the one thing we know

00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:02.470
is that you will not contribute
to the recovery, right?

00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:04.900
If the lights go out and
you run to the hills,

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:06.640
you will not be a
party to the Turning

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:08.195
the Lights Back On Project.

00:47:08.195 --> 00:47:09.820
You're going to be
waiting in the hills

00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:11.800
while other people
sort your shit out,

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:14.680
and then coming back and
going, hey, what did I miss?

00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:20.500
And so Burbank is full of people
who I have kind of weak ties

00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:24.160
with, who I feel like I could
ring their doorbell and say,

00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:28.260
our freezer's knocked out so
we're smoking all the meat.

00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:31.250
Do you want to come
over for a barbecue?

00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:33.130
And that's, I
think, the best hope

00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:35.335
we have of surviving a crisis.

00:47:38.524 --> 00:47:41.842
Any other questions?

00:47:41.842 --> 00:47:43.865
How we doing for time?

00:47:43.865 --> 00:47:46.448
[? HEATH ROE: ?] We've got time
for more questions if you guys

00:47:46.448 --> 00:47:47.059
have them.

00:47:47.059 --> 00:47:48.033
CORY DOCTOROW: Yeah.

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:52.580
I'm told that if
we finish early,

00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:54.920
I get to fly home
in Larry's jet, so.

00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:00.740
Nope?

00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:02.920
All right, then--
well, if any of you

00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:04.410
would like to bring
your books up,

00:48:04.410 --> 00:48:06.574
and if anyone has a writing
implement I can borrow,

00:48:06.574 --> 00:48:07.990
because that's one
thing I forgot,

00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:12.100
I'd be happy to
deface your books.

00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:14.100
