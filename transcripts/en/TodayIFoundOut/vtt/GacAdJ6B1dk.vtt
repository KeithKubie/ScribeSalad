00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:24.970
On April 17, 1955, the 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.960
greatest scientist of his generation checked
himself into Princeton Hospital due to chest

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.960
pains.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.789
By early the next morning, Albert Einstein
had died from an abdominal aortic aneurysm

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:40.550
– the rupture of the aorta, the heart vessel
that’s the body’s main supplier of blood.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.539
While word was still getting out that the
great Dr. Einstein had passed away at the

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:47.920
age of 76, something rather disturbing was
happening at the hospital, if not downright

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:48.920
nefarious.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.590
Einstein’s brain, the keeper of one of the
world’s greatest intellects, had been stolen.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.859
And that is just the beginning of the story.

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:57.719
Dr. Thomas Stolz Harvey was the pathologist
on call during the early morning hours of

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.399
the 18th and was the doctor assigned to attend
to Dr. Einstein.

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.940
Seven hours after the great scientist’s
death at 1 am, Harvey began the autopsy he

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.910
claimed he was given permission to do.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.390
After determining the cause of death, Harvey
went about removing, measuring, and weighing

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.390
Einstein’s brain.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.140
Harvey later would say that he "knew we had
permission to do an autopsy, and I assumed

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.030
that we were going to study the brain.”

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.140
To this day, no paperwork nor permission prior
to the autopsy has ever been found.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.910
After all the calculations had been done,
Dr. Harvey interjected and immersed the brain

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:28.910
in formaldehyde.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.410
After he was done with that, he took Einstein’s
eyeballs out, which were later given to Einstein’s

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.760
eye doctor Henry Adams (rumors still exist
that the eyeballs are in a safe deposit box

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.360
somewhere in New York City).

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.200
Finally, he gave the rest of the body back
to be cremated.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.300
The removal of the brain and eyeballs were
against Einstein’s final wishes.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.770
According to to Brian Burrell’s book Postcards
from the Brain Museum, Einstein had left very

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.120
specific instructions.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.950
He wanted to be cremated with the brain still
inside of his head and his ashes scattered

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.950
in secret, in order to "discourage idolaters."

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.980
So not only was this against Einstein’s
personal wishes, Harvey had no legal nor medical

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.000
right for keeping the brain.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.700
He wasn’t even a neurosurgeon nor a brain
specialist.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.870
His responsibility simply was to determine
the cause of death – which was heart failure

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.180
and had very little to do with brain (at least,
directly).

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.930
Burrell speculates that there were two possible
reasons for Harvey to remove and keep for

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.170
himself one of history’s most famous brains
– one is that it was at the request of Harry

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.920
Zimmerman, Einstein’s personal physician
and a mentor of Harvey.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.630
Zimmerman never publicly said this to be true,
though did he make the request for the brain

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.069
after the deed was done.

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.800
The other theory that Burrell gives is that
Harvey, perhaps inspired by the study done

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.940
on Lenin’s brain in 1926, simply got “caught
up in the moment and was transfixed in the

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.370
presence of greatness.";

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.270
Whatever the case, on April 19th, after the
removal and storing of the brain, Harvey went

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.680
about asking for permission retroactively
from Einstein’s son, Hans Albert Einstein.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.400
Hans Albert granted the permission, making
Harvey promise that his father’s mind would

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.470
be used for careful scientific study and the
findings published in legitimate medical journals.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.010
When the New York Times printed Einstein’s
obituary on April 20th, it said that Dr. Harvey

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.190
performed the autopsy “with the permission
of the scientist’s son," with another headline

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.860
that same day proclaiming “Son Asked Study
of Einstein Brain."

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.190
It makes no mention that this permission came
after the fact.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.260
When word got out that Harvey had the brain,
requests came flooding in from across the

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.050
world from others who wanted to see and study
it.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.910
As mentioned, one request came from Dr. Harry
Zimmerman in New York, whom Harvey promised

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.860
would get the first chance to study it.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.489
Zimmerman and his hospital in New York prepared
for Harvey and the brain, but it never showed.

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:42.739
A short time later, it was announced by Princeton
Hospital that the brain would stay in New

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.170
Jersey.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.260
“Snarl Develops Over Which Hospital Will
Conduct Einstein Brain Study," was a headline

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.930
in the Washington Post, while another newspaper
went with “Hospitals Tiff over Brain of

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:53.930
Einstein."

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.540
The controversy over ownership of Einstein’s
brain had become a circus and it was about

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.650
to get even more bizarre.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.300
Technically, Princeton Hospital never really
had possession of the brain.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.730
Dr. Harvey did.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.130
He kept it in a jar in his home office.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.630
Soon after the public spat with Dr. Zimmerman
and with still no medical studies on the brain

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.870
underway, Dr. Harvey was fired from Princeton
Hospital.

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.210
He took the brain with him.

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:21.739
Harvey went to the University of Pennsylvania,
and with help of a technician, cut up the

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.980
brain into a thousand slides and 240 blocks,
putting them into squares of celluloid – a

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:27.980
semi-solid plastic-like substance.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.640
He finally gave some of the pieces to Dr.
Zimmerman and kept the remainder of Albert

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.170
Einstein’s brain in two formalin-filled
glass jars for himself.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.920
Other researchers made overtures about wanting
the rest of the brain, but Harvey refused

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.210
to let go – insisting that he was “a year
from finishing study on the specimen."

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.130
Harvey’s marriage fell apart and he quickly
packed his bags to get out of Princeton, bound

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.520
for the midwest.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.090
Before he could leave, his (ex) wife threatened
to “dispose" of the brain.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.580
Of course, Harvey didn’t let this happen
and took it with him as he made his way to

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.510
Wichita, Kansas, where he worked as a medical
supervisor in a biological testing lab.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.110
Legendarily, during his time in Wichita, he
kept Einstein’s brain in a cider box underneath

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.110
a beer cooler.

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.280
For the next thirty years, Harvey moved around
the Midwest, towing the brain along, never

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.639
publishing any studies.

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:16.510
Every once in awhile, a researcher would contact
him and he would send them a slide or two,

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.540
hoping they could do the research he never
did.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.949
A few times, the story of Einstein’s brain
drew the public’s attention again, especially

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:29.300
after a 1978 article in the regional magazine
New Jersey Monthly by Steven Levy.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.360
Said Levy about his first experience with
Harvey and the brain,

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.060
At first he didn’t want to tell me anything,
but after a while he finally admitted that

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.160
he had the brain.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.070
After a longer while, he sheepishly told me
it was IN THE VERY OFFICE WE WERE SITTING

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.070
IN.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.570
He walked to a box labeled “Costa Cider"
and pulled out two big Mason jars.

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.550
In those were the remains of the brain that
changed the world.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.120
Another documented interaction comes from
Kenji Sugimoto, a Japanese professor and Einstein

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.540
expert, who visited Harvey in Kansas:

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.530
Humbly, the professor asks if he maybe could
bring a piece back with him to Japan."Sure,

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:06.160
why not," Harvey replies and walks out to
the kitchen to fetch his bread board and a

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.160
knife.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.000
Harvey finds an old pill cup to store the
slice in and pours a little formaldehyde in.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.350
In 1985, three decades after Einstein’s
death, someone finally published a study on

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:21.560
Einstein’s brain after receiving slides
from Harvey – Marian Diamond of UCLA.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.990
Published in Experimental Neurology, her study
was (admittedly) far from conclusive, but

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:30.600
it did speculate that Einstein’s brain had
more glial cells for every neuron than a normal

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.600
brain.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.590
This could mean that the cells had a greater
“metabolic need" – meaning more energy

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.520
was used and needed, which it was speculated
could also mean an increase in conceptual

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.160
and thinking skills.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.510
While recent research may have debunked this
theory, there were finally studies about Einstein’s

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:49.850
stolen brain published in legitimate medical
journals.

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:53.139
Yet, this still wasn’t the end to the brain’s
journey.

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:57.889
In 1988, Thomas Harvey had his medical license
revoked when he failed a three day competency

00:06:57.889 --> 00:06:58.889
exam in Missouri.

00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:03.850
A few years later, he returned to Princeton,
only to be convinced by writer Michael Paterniti

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:06.680
to go meet Einstein’s granddaughter in California.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.490
Of course, he had to bring the brain.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:13.430
In Paterniti’s book Driving Mr. Albert,
it describes, with the jars of brain in a

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:17.669
duffle-bag in the trunk of Harvey’s Buick
Skylark, their drive to sunny California.

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:22.310
They did, indeed, meet Evelyn Einstein in
Berkeley, where Harvey forgot the brain at

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:23.590
her house when he left.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:26.180
She returned it to him, not wanting anything
to do with it.

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:30.639
Thomas Harvey passed away in 2007, but before
he did, he donated the brain to the Princeton

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:35.270
Hospital, the same place that the brain began
its extra-curricular journey over fifty years

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:36.270
prior.

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:40.480
Public interest once again increased and researchers,
who had received slides of Einstein’s brain

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:44.370
over the years, sent them back to Princeton
and the University of Pennsylvania (where

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:45.919
they were originally cut).

00:07:45.919 --> 00:07:49.770
Today, the Mutter Museum in Philadelphia is
only place in the world one can currently

00:07:49.770 --> 00:08:19.300
see pieces of Einstein’s brain (slides were
also once on display in 2013 in 

00:08:19.300 --> 00:09:05.820
the National Museum of Health and Medicine
in Maryland) – on slides, stained, and with

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:20.010
handwritten notes from Thomas Harvey.
