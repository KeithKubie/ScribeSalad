00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.920
One of the first challenges that firefighters
face when they arrive at a fire is finding

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.330
a suitable water source that provides enough
water for the type of fire they are fighting.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.820
Common sense tells us a car on fire will require
much less water than a burning apartment building.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.320
There are formulas used by firefighters that
will tell them approximately how much water

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.640
is needed to fight a given fire (see bonus
facts below).

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.010
Fire hydrants are commonly color coded to
indicate how much water a particular hydrant

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.010
will provide.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.010
This allows for quick decision making when
they are deciding which hydrant to access.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.250
Water supply for firefighting is rated in
gallons per minute (GPM) available.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.770
In most urban and suburban areas, water supply
is from a far away source such as a reservoir

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:45.770
or lake.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.810
This water is pumped through a system of above
ground and underground pipes, then supplied

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.960
to all of the buildings and homes in a given
area.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.780
Every water system is maintained by the water
district supplying the water.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:54.900
Most is used for everyday purposes like drinking
water, bathing, doing your laundry, and watering

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.900
your lawn.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.530
When there is a fire, water districts are
required to allow firefighters to access this

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.530
water for firefighting purposes.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.530
They do this with the commonly known fire
hydrant.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.530
Due to the numerous different supply systems
throughout the United States, there can be

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.530
a wide range of available supply, from 500
GPM or less to over 2500 GPM.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.530
In an effort to make it easier for firefighters
to know what a specific hydrant will supply,

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.360
the National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA)
recommends that fire departments and water

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.760
districts follow a set standard of color-coding.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.990
Known as NFPA 291, it says fire hydrants using
public water supply systems should be painted

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.049
chrome yellow, and their tops and caps should
indicate the available GPM.

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:28.049
Below 500GPM should be red, 500-999 GPM should
be orange, 1000-1499 GPM should be green,

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.570
and 1500 GPM or more should be blue.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.479
If the hydrant is not hooked to a public water
system, but instead is accessing a private

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.540
system (as in the case of a shared well by
several houses in a specific neighborhood)

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.170
the hydrant should be painted a color distinguishing
it from a publicly supplied system.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.249
NFPA recommends red.

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:53.520
OSHA (occupational safety and health administration)
further recommends that a hydrant be painted

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.380
violet for any source that is non-potable
(so what color should we paint a hydrant that

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.109
is non-potable and from a private source OSHA?….

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:04.109
sketchy!).

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:07.020
Furthermore, if a hydrant is inoperable, it’s
recommended that it be painted black.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.860
If it’s only going to be inoperable for
a short time, it’s common to just place

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.740
a black bag over the hydrant.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.600
GPM is only one of two factors of water supply.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.060
The other is pressure, rated in PSI (pounds
per square inch).

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.830
All hydrants are assumed to provide at least
20 psi.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.990
If it doesn’t, NFPA recommends that the
rated pressure be stenciled on the top of

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.810
the hydrant and on the caps.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.640
They also recommend this for extremely high
pressured hydrants.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.750
Too much pressure can cause damage to the
fire equipment if precautions aren’t taken.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.160
The NFPA sets these standards and most fire
departments and water companies try to follow

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.160
them.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.920
In the end however, these are just guidelines
and not necessarily requirements.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.970
As such, not every area will follow these
recommendations.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.750
In 2005, Firehouse.com conducted a poll of
firefighters and other fire service personnel

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.860
asking if their departments use this color-coding
system- 47% did and 44% did not.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.560
8% of respondents did not have hydrants in
their areas.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.870
In cases where there are no hydrants, water
supply trucks, known as tenders, will fill

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.540
up with water from near-by sources, such as
lakes and rivers, and bring it to the fire.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.950
The NFPA recommendation is not the only color-coding
system used.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.120
Many different municipalities create their
own, for their specific situation.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.830
For instance, the Moraga-Orinda (CA) Fire
District has taken to color-coding the tops

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.270
of the hydrants following NFPA recommendations.

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.190
They then color code the caps for the specific
PSI provided.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.230
They also mark for “dead end” hydrants,
hydrants only supplied from one direction.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.840
They have their own hydrant body color system,
and an arrow system indicating higher pressure

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:42.840
hydrants.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.470
They also provide Roman-numeral markings that
indicate where the shut off valves are for

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.820
that particular hydrant.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.760
So when you are driving around your neighborhood
and see a hydrant painted a specific color,

00:03:51.760 --> 00:04:02.070
be assured that color has a purpose.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:25.400
If you are one that has a hydrant on your
property, it is not at all uncommon to try

00:04:25.400 --> 00:05:15.879
and hide this “eye-sore” by decorating
it with flowers, butterfly’s, and all manner

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:17.949
of interesting artistry.

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:53.900
If you do, don’t be surprised if you get
a knock on your door from the local water

00:05:53.900 --> 00:06:33.910
district or fire department telling you 
your amateur art is not appreciated!
