Another trick to aiding our ability to recall previously learned information,

00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:08.366
is by using a mnemonic device. A mnemonic device is a method to help us

00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:11.982
remember information. For example, we may come up with a rhyme to remember

00:00:11.982 --> 00:00:15.950
something or perhaps an acronym. So, if we have to remember the grocery list

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.777
that we made earlier in the lesson, this one. We can circle the first letter of

00:00:19.777 --> 00:00:24.305
each of the items, and come up with an acronym. We gave you a pneumonic device

00:00:24.305 --> 00:00:27.539
in lesson 2, when we where describing how to remember the difference between an

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.178
independent and a dependent variable. We told you to remember that the

00:00:33.178 --> 00:00:38.446
independent variable starts with an I, and investigator starts with an I. So

00:00:38.446 --> 00:00:42.606
it's the investigator that manipulates the independent variable. That was a

00:00:42.606 --> 00:00:43.500
mnemonic device.
