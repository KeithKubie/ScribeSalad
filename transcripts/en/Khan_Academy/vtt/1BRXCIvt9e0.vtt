00:00:00.414 --> 00:00:01.633
- [Voiceover] So let's get some practice

00:00:01.633 --> 00:00:04.825
simplifying hairy expressions
that have exponents in them.

00:00:04.825 --> 00:00:07.200
And so we have a hairy
expression right over here

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.051
and I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:09.051 --> 00:00:11.880
and see if you can rewrite
this in a simpler way.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.150
All right, let's work
through this together

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.602
and the first thing that jumps out at me

00:00:15.602 --> 00:00:16.647
is the numerator here.

00:00:16.647 --> 00:00:19.510
I have the number 125
raised to the 1/8 power

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.914
times the same number, the same base, 125,

00:00:22.914 --> 00:00:24.957
raised to the 5/8 power.

00:00:24.957 --> 00:00:26.969
So I can rewrite this numerator.

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:29.458
I can rewrite this
numerator using what I know

00:00:29.458 --> 00:00:31.075
of exponent properties

00:00:31.075 --> 00:00:34.659
as being equal to 125

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:36.719
to the sum of these two exponents.

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.586
To the negative 1/8 power plus 5/8 power.

00:00:41.696 --> 00:00:44.909
All of that is going to be
over the existing denominator

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:47.429
we have, which is five to the 1/2.

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:51.753
All of that is going to be
over five to the 1/2 power.

00:00:51.753 --> 00:00:53.005
So, these are equivalent.

00:00:53.005 --> 00:00:55.735
Notice, all I did is
I added the exponents,

00:00:55.735 --> 00:00:57.790
these two exponents
because I had the same base

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.694
and we were taking the
product of both of these

00:01:00.694 --> 00:01:04.560
125 to the negative
1/8 and 125 to the 5/8.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.037
And so negative 1/8 plus 5/8,

00:01:07.037 --> 00:01:09.964
well that is 1/2.

00:01:09.964 --> 00:01:12.664
So, this is,

00:01:12.664 --> 00:01:15.824
this right over here is, 1/2.

00:01:15.824 --> 00:01:19.664
So, this is 125 to the
1/2, over five to the 1/2.

00:01:19.664 --> 00:01:21.892
Well, that's going to be the same thing.

00:01:21.892 --> 00:01:25.197
This is going to be equivalent to

00:01:25.197 --> 00:01:29.517
125 over five,

00:01:29.517 --> 00:01:33.612
over five, to the 1/2 power.

00:01:33.612 --> 00:01:36.610
To the 1/2 power.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.864
If I raise 125 to the 1/2 and I'm dividing

00:01:38.864 --> 00:01:40.174
by five to the 1/2,

00:01:40.174 --> 00:01:42.065
that's the same thing as
doing the division first

00:01:42.065 --> 00:01:44.372
and then raising that to the 1/2 power.

00:01:44.372 --> 00:01:47.063
Well, what's 125 divided by five?

00:01:47.063 --> 00:01:48.666
Well, that's just 25.

00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:51.473
Now what's 25 to the 1/2?

00:01:51.473 --> 00:01:53.419
Well, that's the same thing
as the principal square root

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:57.272
of 25, which is equal to five.

00:01:57.272 --> 00:02:00.563
And we're all done, that
simplified quite nicely.

00:02:00.563 --> 00:02:01.721
Let's do another one of these.

00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:03.357
And this one is a little more interesting,

00:02:03.357 --> 00:02:05.380
'cause we are starting
to involve a variable,

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.226
we have the variable w,

00:02:07.226 --> 00:02:10.834
but it's really going to be
somewhat the same process.

00:02:10.834 --> 00:02:14.439
And here the thing that jumps
out at me is the denominator.

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:17.072
I have the same base, 3w-squared.

00:02:17.072 --> 00:02:20.739
3w-squared raised to
one power, one exponent,

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.018
times the same base, 3w-squared,
raised to another power.

00:02:24.018 --> 00:02:26.690
So, this is going to be equal to,

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.835
this is going to be equal to

00:02:28.835 --> 00:02:30.532
our numerator we can just rewrite it

00:02:30.532 --> 00:02:33.465
12w to the seventh power

00:02:33.465 --> 00:02:36.665
over negative 3/2

00:02:36.665 --> 00:02:41.390
over our denominator we
can write as this base,

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.811
3w-squared,

00:02:44.811 --> 00:02:47.251
and we can add these two exponents.

00:02:47.251 --> 00:02:50.820
So, we could add negative
2/3 to negative 5/6.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.470
Negative 2/3 to negative 5/6.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.315
Well, what is that going to be?

00:02:58.315 --> 00:03:00.755
So, let's see, if I do negative,

00:03:00.755 --> 00:03:04.349
negative 2/3 is the same
thing as negative 4/6,

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.671
minus 5/6,

00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:09.661
which is equal to negative 9/6,

00:03:09.661 --> 00:03:13.291
which is equal to negative 3/2.

00:03:13.291 --> 00:03:16.660
So, this right over here is
the same thing as negative 3/2.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.002
Let me just write that.

00:03:19.002 --> 00:03:21.038
Negative 3/2 power.

00:03:21.038 --> 00:03:25.806
Negative 2/3 plus negative
5/6 is negative 3/2.

00:03:25.806 --> 00:03:28.081
Now, what's interesting is I
have a negative 3/2 up here

00:03:28.081 --> 00:03:29.959
and I have a negative 3/2 over here,

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.979
so, we can do the same thing
we did in the last problem.

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:34.743
This could simplify to

00:03:34.743 --> 00:03:37.113
12w,

00:03:37.113 --> 00:03:40.177
12w to the seventh power,

00:03:40.177 --> 00:03:43.136
over 3w-squared.

00:03:43.136 --> 00:03:44.526
3w-squared.

00:03:44.526 --> 00:03:46.265
All of that,

00:03:46.265 --> 00:03:49.442
all of that to the,

00:03:49.442 --> 00:03:53.262
all of that to the negative 3/2 power.

00:03:53.262 --> 00:03:54.276
Notice what we did here.

00:03:54.276 --> 00:03:55.628
I had something to the negative 3/2

00:03:55.628 --> 00:03:58.137
divided by something
else to the negative 3/2.

00:03:58.137 --> 00:04:00.352
Well, that's the same thing
as doing the division first

00:04:00.352 --> 00:04:04.619
and then raising that
quotient to the negative 3/2.

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:05.880
And what's nice about this,

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.717
this is pretty
straightforward to simplify.

00:04:07.717 --> 00:04:10.371
12 divided by three is four,

00:04:10.371 --> 00:04:13.741
and w to the seventh divided by w-squared,

00:04:13.741 --> 00:04:16.128
well, we could divide both by w-squared

00:04:16.128 --> 00:04:17.438
or you could say this is the same thing

00:04:17.438 --> 00:04:20.108
as w to the seven-minus-two power.

00:04:20.108 --> 00:04:23.616
So this is going to be
w to the fifth power.

00:04:23.616 --> 00:04:25.931
W to the fifth power.

00:04:25.931 --> 00:04:29.315
And so it all simplified to 4w

00:04:29.315 --> 00:04:31.265
to the fifth power

00:04:31.265 --> 00:04:33.571
to the negative 3/2.

00:04:33.571 --> 00:04:35.622
To the negative 3/2.

00:04:35.622 --> 00:04:38.121
Now, if we want to, this
is already pretty simple

00:04:38.121 --> 00:04:40.410
and at some point it becomes somewhat

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:41.972
someone's opinion on which is expression

00:04:41.972 --> 00:04:43.597
is simpler than another,
and it might depend

00:04:43.597 --> 00:04:45.415
on what you're using the expression for,

00:04:45.415 --> 00:04:47.760
but one could argue that
you could keep trying

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.355
to simplify this, this
is the same thing as,

00:04:51.355 --> 00:04:55.991
this is the same thing as
four to the negative 3/2.

00:04:55.991 --> 00:04:58.700
To the negative 3/2.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.388
Times w to the fifth

00:05:03.388 --> 00:05:05.338
to the negative 3/2.

00:05:05.338 --> 00:05:06.959
And once again this is
just straight out of our

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:08.798
exponent properties.

00:05:08.798 --> 00:05:11.209
Now, four to the negative 3/2,

00:05:11.209 --> 00:05:12.377
let's just think about that.

00:05:12.377 --> 00:05:15.333
Four to the negative 3/2.

00:05:15.333 --> 00:05:18.903
We're using a different color
just as a bit of an aside.

00:05:18.903 --> 00:05:22.873
So, four to the negative 3/2 is equal to,

00:05:22.873 --> 00:05:27.286
that's the same thing as
one over four to the 3/2,

00:05:27.286 --> 00:05:28.541
and, let's see.

00:05:30.101 --> 00:05:32.198
The square root of four is
two and then we raise that

00:05:32.198 --> 00:05:34.288
to the third power, it's gonna be eight.

00:05:34.288 --> 00:05:36.827
So, this is equal to 1/8.

00:05:36.827 --> 00:05:39.804
So, that's equal to
1/8, and so all of this

00:05:39.804 --> 00:05:41.674
is going to be equal to 1/8.

00:05:41.674 --> 00:05:43.667
And then w to the fifth, and then that

00:05:43.667 --> 00:05:47.128
to the negative 3/2, we can
multiply these exponents.

00:05:47.128 --> 00:05:51.354
That's going to be w to the
five times negative 3/2.

00:05:51.354 --> 00:05:55.112
Well, it's gonna be the
negative 15/2 power.

00:05:55.112 --> 00:05:57.673
So, I don't know which one
you would say is simpler.

00:05:57.673 --> 00:06:00.751
This one over here or this one over here

00:06:00.751 --> 00:06:03.377
but they are equivalent and
they both are a lot simpler

00:06:03.377 --> 00:06:05.077
than where we started.
