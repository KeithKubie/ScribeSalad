00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.980
We are asked to represent the
following function on the

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:04.820
coordinate plane.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.560
And they give us domain, and
then they give us a range, a

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.250
set of values that our
function can take on.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.970
And the way the question has
been phrased, I'm assuming

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:19.820
they assume that the negative 8
maps to the 4, the negative

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.260
6 maps to the 3, the negative 4
maps to the 2, the negative

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.310
2 maps to 1, and the
0 maps to 0.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.120
Because you could have another
function with this exact same

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.090
domain, and this exact same
range, where the mapping is

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.480
different, where negative
8 maps to 3, and

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.890
negative 6 maps to 4.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.650
So this domain and this
range could be for

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:40.880
many different functions.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.070
But when they say represent the
following function, I'm

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.470
assuming that they want us to
assume that they're kind of in

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:48.690
order, the pairing.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.600
So let's just graph this
function, or represent it

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.450
using their terminology.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.130
So let me draw some axes here.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.200
So this is the domain, the
independent variable, just

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.720
like that, often known as the
x-axis or the horizontal axis.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.250
And all of our domain, all of
the values, these are all

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.790
non-positive numbers, so let
me give a lot more space to

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:11.320
quadrant II.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.980
All of our range are
positive numbers.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.940
They're going to be hanging out
in the top left quadrant,

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.670
or quadrant II, just
like that.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.100
And the values that my domain
can take on are 0 through

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.780
negative 8, and every even
negative number.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.260
So it's 0, let me do it like
this, so 0 is there.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:38.340
And then we have negative 2,
negative 4, negative 6, and

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.160
then we have negative
8 just like that.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.920
And then our range goes
from 0 through 4.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.960
So this is 0, then you have 1,
then you have 2, then you have

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.560
3, and then you have 4.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.870
So if we assume the mapping,
that if you give this function

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.610
a negative 8, it's going
to map to 4, then

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:59.590
we can plot it here.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.170
So if we take this first pair
right there, you give me a

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.490
negative 8, this function
is going to give me a 4.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.539
So negative 8, 4 is that
point right there.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.390
So if you imagine that this is
the x-axis, this would be the

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.700
f of x axis, if we're assuming
that f is this function.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.320
You give me a negative
6, I'll give you a 3.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.540
Negative 6 and 3.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.740
You give me a negative 4, this
function will pop out a 2.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.640
Negative 4 comma 2.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.040
And then you give a negative
2, this function

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.060
will pop out a 1.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.910
F of negative 2 is 1.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.030
And then finally, f of 0 is 0.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.890
So we'll just plot
it right there.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:51.800
So that's the function.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.930
I've represented it.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.710
And remember, I just assumed
that negative 8 maps to 4,

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.880
negative 6 maps to 3, but you
could have multiple functions

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.610
that have this domain
and range.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.950
But just the way that they said
the following function,

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.440
I'm assuming this is what
they want us to do.
