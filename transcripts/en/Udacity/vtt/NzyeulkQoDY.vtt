00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.318
So first, our selective attention is when we're focusing on what the

00:00:03.318 --> 00:00:06.914
professor's saying and ignoring when the room is cold or the person by us is

00:00:06.914 --> 00:00:12.504
smacking. Your inattentional blindness is when you didn't notice that there was

00:00:12.504 --> 00:00:16.158
a man outside doing interpretive dance and reciting a poem saying I love you

00:00:16.158 --> 00:00:21.952
Tory, be mine, but everybody else in class noticed. Here, when you heard the

00:00:21.952 --> 00:00:25.917
people behind you talking about your favorite band, this was a cocktail party

00:00:25.917 --> 00:00:30.526
effect. Given you're focusing on the essay, here again, we have selective

00:00:30.526 --> 00:00:34.888
attention. And finally, when you realize the girl you borrowed the pen from was

00:00:34.888 --> 00:00:38.192
no longer sitting next to you and it was now a guy that was sleeping on his

00:00:38.192 --> 00:00:41.931
desk. This was your change blindness.
