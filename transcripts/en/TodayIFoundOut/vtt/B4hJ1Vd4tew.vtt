00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:16.650
Anyone who has been in a crowded bar around
closing time would agree that the higher your

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.730
alcohol consumption, the more attractive you
seem to find whoever you happen to be flirting

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.160
with at last call.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.099
Their smile is radiant; their eyes are sparkling-
everything about them is sexy, alluring and

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.099
irresistible.

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.860
However, if you were stone-cold sober, you
might not give them a second glance, and if

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.450
you get carried away and spend the night with
your new friend, you may wake up the next

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.489
morning and wonder just what the hell you
were thinking – and seeing.

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.690
This is called the Beer Goggles phenomenon,
and most of us that partake have fallen into

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.020
its trap to one degree or another.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.610
The first question that comes to mind is whether
or not the individuals you’re looking at

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.589
are really more attractive to you or if your
judgment of things is simply being impaired

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:04.720
by alcohol.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.030
So perhaps they really look the same to you
as later, but when drunk you just don’t

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.920
care, with alcohol increasing your desire
for sex and suppressing your inhibitions.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.750
But it turns out, several studies done in
the last few decades are beginning to show

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.329
that it’s not all just being extra horny
and less picky.

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:28.741
For instance, a study done by St. Andrews
and Glasgow Universities found that “… men

00:01:28.741 --> 00:01:34.241
and women who have consumed a moderate amount
of alcohol find the faces of members of the

00:01:34.241 --> 00:01:38.960
opposite sex 25% more attractive than their
sober counterparts.”

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.969
Other studies have shown similar trends.

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:46.119
For instance, another study done at the University
of Bristol with 84 college students showed

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:52.290
that, on average, they rated people’s attractiveness
10% higher a mere 15 minutes after drinking

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.380
a moderate amount of alcohol, as little as
24 U.S. ounces of beer.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.930
Further, the sex of the individual the students
looked at didn’t matter.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.469
Yes, guys will rate guys more attractive and
women will rate women more attractive after

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.259
drinking too, regardless of their normal sexual
preferences.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.400
Interestingly enough, this boost in attractiveness
is not universal.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.610
In a study done at the University of Leicester
in 2011, it showed that adults actually find

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.200
the faces of 10 years old, less attractive
when drunk, not more as when looking at adult

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.200
faces.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.450
Further, these individuals were able to accurately
judge the ages of the people whose faces they

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.980
were looking at pictures of.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.590
So while attractiveness varied based on whether
one has been drinking or not, the ability

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.590
to judge age did not.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.870
In any event, so if it’s truly not just
us lowering our standards, what’s going

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.390
on here to make other adult faces look more
attractive?

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.180
While further research still needs done, the
leading theory currently is that it has something

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.870
to do with bilateral symmetry.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.739
This simply means that if a human body was
split down the vertical center, humans typically

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:01.209
find people more attractive the closer each
side of the individual is to being a mirror

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:02.370
of the other.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.629
A series of studies, such as one done at the
London’s Roehampton University, suggest

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:12.379
that alcohol impairs our ability to perceive
asymmetry, and this could potentially be the

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:16.750
reason for people appearing more attractive
when one is under the influence.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.159
The researchers described the experiment thusly:

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:25.870
We tested the hypotheses that acute alcohol
consumption decreases ability to detect asymmetry

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.470
in faces and reduces preference for symmetrical
faces over asymmetrical faces.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.330
Twenty images of a pair of faces and then
20 images of a single face were displayed

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.840
on a computer, one at a time.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.030
Participants were instructed to state which
face of each of the face pairs displayed was

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.610
most attractive and then whether the single
face being displayed was symmetrical or not.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.849
Data were collected near campus bars at Roehampton
University.

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:57.069
Sixty-four self-selecting students who undertook
the study were classified as either sober

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.050
(control) or intoxicated with alcohol.

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:05.230
For each face pair or single face displayed,
participant response was recorded and details

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.200
of the alcohol consumption of participants
that day were also obtained.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.799
What this boiled down to was that the sober
test participants were more drawn to people

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:20.530
with symmetrical faces, and were better at
picking them out, which supported the researchers’

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:21.530
hypothesis.

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.310
Further, intoxicated individuals were less
able to notice asymmetry.

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.170
An unexpected discovery was that males proved
better than females at determining whether

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.770
faces were asymmetrical or not.

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.861
It is theorized that this perhaps has something
to do with the fact that, in general, men

00:04:36.861 --> 00:04:41.919
are more sexually stimulated visually than
women are, so whether consciously or not,

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.330
naturally pay more attention to such things.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.539
The researchers concluded: “The reduced
ability of inebriated people to perceive asymmetry

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:54.260
may be an important mechanism underlying the
higher ratings of facial attractiveness they

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:00.599
give for members of the opposite sex and hence
their increased frequency of mate choice.”

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:04.510
Interestingly enough, it would seem that beer
goggles work both ways.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.890
Not only will alcohol make those around you
become more attractive to you, it can also

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.200
turn you into a vision of epic awesomeness…
at least in your own mind.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.200
(Where have you been your whole life?)

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.029
That said, the alcohol in this case isn’t
strictly necessary; you just need to think

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:19.250
you drank some.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.860
Apropos, Laurent Begue at the Pierre Mendes-France
University conducted an experiment to explore

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.850
the phenomenon of The Drunker I Am, The Hotter
I Get Syndrome.

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.890
She asked 19 patrons in a French bar to rate
their attractiveness on a scale of one to

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:34.890
seven.

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.360
Their alcohol levels were then measured with
a breathalyzer test.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.000
Not surprisingly, the participants who were
more biffed were also more full of themselves.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.270
That was an extremely limited sample-size,
though, so as a follow-up, Begue performed

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.910
a balanced placebo test with 96 male volunteers.

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.560
They were told they were conducting market
research for fruit cocktail, and that half

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.550
of the group would be given an alcoholic drink
while the other would test the non-alcoholic

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:59.550
version.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.690
After giving the booze enough time to work
its magic, all the guys recorded a fake advertising

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.750
spot for the fake beverage company.

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.060
Immediately after, they watched a playback
and rated their own wonderfulness.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:15.469
As alluded to, not just those who had alcohol,
but those who believed they had alcohol, gave

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:17.370
themselves the best reviews.

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.349
Those who hadn’t had anything to drink – or
had but didn’t know that they had – were

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:23.100
the humblest among the bunch.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.450
So what have we learned?

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:28.610
At least according to this study, in part
we feel happier and more attractive after

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.720
a few cocktails seemingly because we assume
that we will be in the first place.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.740
There is a definite downside here though.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.730
When a panel of impartial, sober judges took
a look-see at the advertising spots, the segments

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:44.250
done by the guys that gave themselves top
marks were voted the least appealing.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:49.250
That, perhaps, explains why it’s so hard
to impress that hot number who just showed

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.680
up at the bar, when you’ve had more beers
than you can count.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:58.500
So in the end, it would seem from the studies
to date that, while it’s not yet fully understood,

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:03.770
the “beer goggle” effect is probably real
beyond being partially influenced by the simple

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:09.560
fact that when your standards and inhibitions
are lowered while your libido is increased,

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.130
you’re going to partner up with those you
might not otherwise have.

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:18.110
But beyond that, attractiveness based on bilateral
symmetry may be coming into play as well,

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:35.709
literally making certain people seem more
attractive than they otherwise would to you.
