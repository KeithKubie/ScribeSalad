00:00:01.433 --> 00:00:02.834
We are just beginning
to understand that loss

00:00:02.834 --> 00:00:06.767
of grouper and parrot
fish has a domino effect,

00:00:06.767 --> 00:00:08.667
and kills the reef.

00:00:08.667 --> 00:00:12.500
It's happening so fast, it
doesn't take an old-timer

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.133
to remember the good old days.

00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:18.500
In just my short
lifetime of 19 years,

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.934
been able to see immense
change in at least the one

00:00:21.934 --> 00:00:25.066
habitat that I've been able
to dive on since I was four

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.934
with my dad.

00:00:26.934 --> 00:00:28.467
[music playing]

00:00:28.467 --> 00:00:32.500
The way I remember it is this
absolutely magical place,

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.066
these immaculate reefs,
such vibrant color no matter

00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:39.367
where you went, a
treasure trove of fish

00:00:39.367 --> 00:00:43.266
and incredible ecosystem.

00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:46.266
But now, going back
the last three years,

00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:49.500
it looks like a pile of
rubble after a building was

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.367
demolished in New York City.

00:00:51.367 --> 00:00:55.800
It's all gray and
white and crumbled,

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.867
and the fish are gone.

00:00:57.867 --> 00:00:59.433
And that's only in--

00:00:59.433 --> 00:01:00.867
And that's just in
the United States.

00:01:00.867 --> 00:01:03.200
In 12 years, yeah.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.533
[music playing]

00:01:11.233 --> 00:01:13.834
The waters around
Buck Island are an oasis

00:01:13.834 --> 00:01:17.767
in a fast-expanding
wasteland fueled by climate

00:01:17.767 --> 00:01:19.967
change and overfishing.

00:01:19.967 --> 00:01:23.667
I would love to have seen
what you saw here as a boy.

00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:26.333
The fish population
was very diverse,

00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:27.900
very large, very colorful.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.033
But you know, even my benchmark
was nothing in comparison

00:01:32.033 --> 00:01:34.033
to my father's benchmark.

00:01:34.033 --> 00:01:35.633
You went, ah!

00:01:35.633 --> 00:01:37.533
You should have seen
it when I was a boy.

00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:39.500
You know, these are
small fish compared

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.367
to when he was growing up.

00:01:43.367 --> 00:01:46.133
The corals need the fish,
the fish need the corals.

00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:48.700
You take the fish away,
the corals are stressed.

00:01:51.734 --> 00:01:54.834
Expanding the refuge to
embrace the devastated reefs

00:01:54.834 --> 00:01:58.367
outside of the monument will
give the natural systems

00:01:58.367 --> 00:02:02.066
a chance to recover.

00:02:02.066 --> 00:02:03.834
People say I came
from a different planet.

00:02:03.834 --> 00:02:05.166
I did.

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:07.033
The planet was so
different when I arrived.

00:02:07.033 --> 00:02:09.633
[music playing]

00:02:09.633 --> 00:02:14.467
90% Of the big fish
are already gone,

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:18.700
but the great news is
we can turn the corner.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.800
We can restore.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.800
