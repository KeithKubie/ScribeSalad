00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.960
We have 7 times 10 to
the fifth over 2 times 10

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.360
to the negative 2 times
2.5 times 10 to the ninth.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.500
So let's try to simplify
this a little bit.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.230
And I'll start off by trying to
simplify this denominator here.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.764
So the numerator's just
7 times 10 to the fifth.

00:00:16.764 --> 00:00:18.430
And the denominator,
I just have a bunch

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.680
of numbers that are being
multiplied times each other.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.229
So I can do it in any order.

00:00:22.229 --> 00:00:23.270
So let me swap the order.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:31.940
So I'm going to do over
2 times 2.5 times 10

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.730
to the negative 2
times 10 to the ninth.

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:42.770
And this is going to be equal
to-- so the numerator I haven't

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.942
changed yet-- 7 times
10 to the fifth over--

00:00:47.942 --> 00:00:50.340
and here in the
denominator, 2 times--

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.310
let me do this in
a new color now.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.520
2 times 2.5 is 5.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.420
And then 10 to the negative
2 times 10 to the ninth,

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.441
when you multiply
two numbers that

00:01:00.441 --> 00:01:02.940
are being raised to exponents
and have the exact same base--

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.580
so it's 10 to the negative 2
times 10 to the negative 9--

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.160
we can add the exponents.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.500
So this is going to be
10 to the 9 minus 2,

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.040
or 10 to the seventh.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.360
So times 10 to the seventh.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.310
And now we can
view this as being

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:27.235
equal to 7 over 5 times
10 to the fifth over 10

00:01:27.235 --> 00:01:27.860
to the seventh.

00:01:36.392 --> 00:01:37.850
Let me do that in
that orange color

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.860
to keep track of the colors.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.550
10 to the seventh.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.650
Now, what is 7 divided by 5?

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.730
7 divided by 5 is equal to--
let's see, it's 1 and 2/5,

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.840
or 1.4.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.400
So I'll just write it as 1.4.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.262
And then 10 to the fifth
divided by 10 to the seventh.

00:01:56.262 --> 00:01:57.970
So that's going to be
the same thing as--

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.050
and there's two
ways to view this.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.008
You could view this as
10 to the fifth times 10

00:02:01.008 --> 00:02:01.830
to the negative 7.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:02.746
You add the exponents.

00:02:02.746 --> 00:02:03.980
You get 10 to the negative 2.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.920
Or you say, hey, look,
I'm dividing this by this.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.039
We have the same base.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.360
We can subtract exponents.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.680
So it's going to be
10 to the 5 minus 7,

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.740
which is 10 to the negative 2.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.480
So this part right over here is
going to simplify to times 10

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.860
to the negative 2.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:21.880
Now, are we done?

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.560
Have we written what we have
here in scientific notation?

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.640
It looks like we have.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.700
This value right over here is
greater than or equal to 1,

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.910
but it is less
than or equal to 9.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.550
It's a digit between 1
and 9, including 1 and 9.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.450
And it's being multiplied
by 10 to some power.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.410
So it looks like we're done.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.420
This simplified to 1.4
times 10 to the negative 2.
