Good evening everyone. It's so wonderful
to have friends from all over the city

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.610
all over the world joining us this
evening. It's a rare privilege to work

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:54.430
with an institution like MoMA PS1, and of
course The Museum of Modern Art, on a

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.570
project like this that happens every
year, and in the 18th year in the 18th

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:08.770
incarnation, it's been a true joy to work
with Jenny Sabin very closely as the

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:15.729
projects and the installation that you
see here has evolved, and it's one of the

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:22.690
first and only instances I can imagine
where a rendering—which those of us in

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.759
the architecture community have become
accustomed to for better or worse—but

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:34.720
the work itself is so much better than
the rendering, and not only from the idea

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:41.140
of detail and the immersive quality, but
the fact that one can still get lost in

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:48.310
an architecture of today. Lumen, of course, is here all summer and I highly

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.619
recommend all of you come to Warm Up and enjoy it in its full glory, day and night.

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.369
Thank you.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.700
Wow. Thank you, Sean. Thank you, Anita.
Thank you, Klaus. Thanks to all of you for

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.100
coming out this evening. It's really
amazing to be at this point within the

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.450
YAP program. I've learned so much—it's
been thrilling, it's been intense, and

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:25.590
super exciting. So Lumen really is an
experiment. It's about taking risks

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.890
through collaboration across disciplines
and, more specifically, held in tension as

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.680
you can see within the PS1 courtyard
matrix of walls, Lumen applies insights

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:45.820
and theories from both biology, material
science, yes and mathematics—yes, I do like math—and engineering.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.280
I thank so much to all of you for coming

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.530
out, and I hope you join us until about
9:15. Soon the photoluminescent

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.840
threads will start to glow and emit
light... And I'm really excited to be here.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.360
Thank you.
