00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.470
 Y 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:16.750
 rodolfo garcía I am the biggest product here 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.520
 for commercial see to my right I have to 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.100
 Katherine 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.290
 the designer of the group that created the 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.560
 originator of the idea initially that 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.790
 then we have it to nicolás also in 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.970
 the developers that has been 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:34.360
 programming together with federico the 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:38.800
 application is basically about 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:42.260
 a layer that overcomes what 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.760
 already presented by your club 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.070
 and what we did was mix the 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.050
 web concepts with the concepts of 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.620
 reality actually 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.270
 of reality of real life 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.390
 then the concepts of these two 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:59.710
 we said good perfect pool grabbed and 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:02.079
 put in digital everything we see in the 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.140
 reality with street view from 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:08.580
 this we create some virtual layer that 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:12.009
 generates on that street view image 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.259
 with the content that the user wants 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.930
 put for example I am the owner of a 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:21.220
 local that is on this area a street 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:25.450
 and it's for the live post I'm also 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.470
 the owner of placing a transparency to 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.720
 through this application 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.550
 that what he does and he can say 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.170
 combine the concepts of reality and 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.630
 virtual world with the benefits that 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:39.310
 has the virtual world that is the scope 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:41.920
 Quickly achieve effectiveness 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.800
 who specifically is watching and the 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.740
 concepts of reality that justly 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.259
 is the location where they are 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.290
 just the veracity of the person 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.990
 that is presenting misinformation and 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:59.439
 just align these two concepts 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.490
 to be able to sell in a better way in 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:02.610
 the Web 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.880
 combining the concept of 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:09.320
 classic advertising with everything that 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.320
 offers the web
