okay so now we're gonna talk about the

phenomenological existential /

phenomenological existential /
phenomenological psychiatrists and their

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190
phenomenological psychiatrists and their
 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.950
phenomenological psychiatrists and their
theories from the 1950s and as I

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960
theories from the 1950s and as I
 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.470
theories from the 1950s and as I
mentioned to you before a lot of their

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480
mentioned to you before a lot of their
 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.970
mentioned to you before a lot of their
thinking was motivated by what had

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980
thinking was motivated by what had
 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.670
thinking was motivated by what had
happened in in World War two when I when

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680
happened in in World War two when I when
 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.290
happened in in World War two when I when
I lectured to you last I pointed out I

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300
I lectured to you last I pointed out I
 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.939
I lectured to you last I pointed out I
described Nietzsche and Dostoyevsky's

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949
described Nietzsche and Dostoyevsky's
 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.190
described Nietzsche and Dostoyevsky's
summation of the world situation and

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200
summation of the world situation and
 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.810
summation of the world situation and
really the world psychological situation

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820
really the world psychological situation
 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.490
really the world psychological situation
at the end of the 1800s and that was

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500
at the end of the 1800s and that was
 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.180
at the end of the 1800s and that was
that our new modes of thinking had

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190
that our new modes of thinking had
 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.920
that our new modes of thinking had
undermined our faith in our old modes of

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930
undermined our faith in our old modes of
 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.630
undermined our faith in our old modes of
thinking and that was a problem because

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640
thinking and that was a problem because
 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.130
thinking and that was a problem because
people need something for him to stand

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140
people need something for him to stand
 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.930
people need something for him to stand
on to orient themselves and to move

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940
on to orient themselves and to move
 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.420
on to orient themselves and to move
forward and so Nietzsche and Dostoevsky

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430
forward and so Nietzsche and Dostoevsky
 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.490
forward and so Nietzsche and Dostoevsky
basically both prophesied that the

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500
basically both prophesied that the
 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.119
basically both prophesied that the
consequence of that dissolution would be

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129
consequence of that dissolution would be
 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.590
consequence of that dissolution would be
increased probability of nihilism and

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600
increased probability of nihilism and
 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.660
increased probability of nihilism and
everything that went along with that and

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670
everything that went along with that and
 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.279
everything that went along with that and
Dostoevsky wrote about that actually

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289
Dostoevsky wrote about that actually
 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.349
Dostoevsky wrote about that actually
quite extensively in a book called notes

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359
quite extensively in a book called notes
 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.030

really read because it's one of the most
 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.080
really read because it's one of the most
brilliant psychological studies of a

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090
brilliant psychological studies of a
 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.789
brilliant psychological studies of a
psychologically disturbed man that's

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799
psychologically disturbed man that's
 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.710
psychologically disturbed man that's
ever been written it's very accurate and

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890
there are sections in crime and
 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.230
there are sections in crime and
punishment that are like that - I think

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240
punishment that are like that - I think
 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.910
punishment that are like that - I think
they're unsurpassed in their

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920
they're unsurpassed in their
 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.840
they're unsurpassed in their
representation of sight of psychological

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850
representation of sight of psychological
 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.410
representation of sight of psychological
phenomena I don't I don't know how he

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420
phenomena I don't I don't know how he
 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.240
phenomena I don't I don't know how he
managed it I mean Dostoevsky was

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250
managed it I mean Dostoevsky was
 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.219
managed it I mean Dostoevsky was

morning but they only used blanks which
 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.730
morning but they only used blanks which
of course he didn't know about and that

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740
of course he didn't know about and that
 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.899
of course he didn't know about and that
scared him so badly he developed

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909
scared him so badly he developed
 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.609
scared him so badly he developed
epilepsy and then he had epileptic and

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619
epilepsy and then he had epileptic and
 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.209
epilepsy and then he had epileptic and
by the way and he had epilepsy for the

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219
by the way and he had epilepsy for the
 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.709
by the way and he had epilepsy for the
rest of his life but he had this strange

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719
rest of his life but he had this strange
 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.660
rest of his life but he had this strange
kind of epilepsy which is actually not

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670
kind of epilepsy which is actually not
 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.359
kind of epilepsy which is actually not
all that rare sometimes when people have

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369
all that rare sometimes when people have
 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.070
all that rare sometimes when people have
epilepsy they they experienced this

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080
epilepsy they they experienced this
 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.990
epilepsy they they experienced this
phenomena they call an aura which is an

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000
phenomena they call an aura which is an
 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.670
phenomena they call an aura which is an
altered state of consciousness before

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680
altered state of consciousness before
 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.319
altered state of consciousness before
epileptic seizure hits and they can be

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.329
epileptic seizure hits and they can be
 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:17.330
epileptic seizure hits and they can be
very strange these auras so I read a

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340
very strange these auras so I read a
 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.020
very strange these auras so I read a
case study once about a guy who his aura

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030
case study once about a guy who his aura
 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.030
case study once about a guy who his aura
was that his hand was being possessed by

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040
was that his hand was being possessed by
 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.250
was that his hand was being possessed by
Devils from Hell and he could feel the

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260
Devils from Hell and he could feel the
 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.740
Devils from Hell and he could feel the
possession move up his arm and into his

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750
possession move up his arm and into his
 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.149
possession move up his arm and into his
shoulder and once it hit his head he to

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159
shoulder and once it hit his head he to
 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:31.399
shoulder and once it hit his head he to
have an epileptic seizure and so then

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409
have an epileptic seizure and so then
 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:35.449
have an epileptic seizure and so then
there was another case where where this

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459
there was another case where where this
 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.209
there was another case where where this
man his aura was that his exact double

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:38.219
man his aura was that his exact double
 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:41.089
man his aura was that his exact double
had appeared behind him but if he turned

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099
had appeared behind him but if he turned
 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.379
had appeared behind him but if he turned
and if he turned to look then he'd have

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:42.389
and if he turned to look then he'd have
 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:44.030
and if he turned to look then he'd have
an epileptic seizure but if he didn't

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040
an epileptic seizure but if he didn't
 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.429
an epileptic seizure but if he didn't
turn to look that he wouldn't so these

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:46.439
turn to look that he wouldn't so these
 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:48.319
turn to look that he wouldn't so these
you know brain disorders are very

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329
you know brain disorders are very
 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.110
you know brain disorders are very
strange things because they're well the

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120
strange things because they're well the
 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.210
strange things because they're well the
system that is disordered is alive and

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220
system that is disordered is alive and
 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.830
system that is disordered is alive and
it's capable of any number of

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840
it's capable of any number of
 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.050
it's capable of any number of
extraordinarily peculiar misbehaviors

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060
extraordinarily peculiar misbehaviors
 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.740
extraordinarily peculiar misbehaviors
anyways Dostoyevsky's aura was a world

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750
anyways Dostoyevsky's aura was a world
 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.649
anyways Dostoyevsky's aura was a world
revealing aura and so what Dostoyevsky

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659
revealing aura and so what Dostoyevsky
 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.869
revealing aura and so what Dostoyevsky
would experience was that the meaning of

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879
would experience was that the meaning of
 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:07.429
would experience was that the meaning of
things got deeper and deeper and deeper

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:07.439
things got deeper and deeper and deeper
 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.860
things got deeper and deeper and deeper
and deeper and deeper and then just as

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870
and deeper and deeper and then just as
 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.509
and deeper and deeper and then just as
he was on the verge of discovering the

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519
he was on the verge of discovering the
 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.339
he was on the verge of discovering the
secret to everything he'd have an

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349
secret to everything he'd have an
 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.530
secret to everything he'd have an
epileptic seizure but he said that the

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540
epileptic seizure but he said that the
 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.659
epileptic seizure but he said that the
quality of experience during the aura

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:17.669
quality of experience during the aura
 

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:21.170
quality of experience during the aura
was so high so overpowering and so deep

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180
was so high so overpowering and so deep
 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.210
was so high so overpowering and so deep
that he would have traded all of his

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220
that he would have traded all of his
 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.280
that he would have traded all of his
normal experience just to have had those

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290
normal experience just to have had those
 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.990
normal experience just to have had those
experiences and he had them repeatedly

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000
experiences and he had them repeatedly
 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.259
experiences and he had them repeatedly
and I really do believe that it was this

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269
and I really do believe that it was this
 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.140
and I really do believe that it was this
broadening of his of his vision and

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150
broadening of his of his vision and
 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.539
broadening of his of his vision and
concept by his epilepsy that transformed

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549
concept by his epilepsy that transformed
 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.099
concept by his epilepsy that transformed
him among other things I mean he went

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109
him among other things I mean he went
 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:38.179
him among other things I mean he went
through some pretty damn rough
