00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.639
I have a passion for produce - so can somebody
do me a favor and point me toward the good

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:05.479
stuff?

00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:12.420
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.430
Over the past 5 years or so you may have noticed
the organic produce section slowly getting

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.410
bigger and bigger.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.020
Organic basically means that the produce was
grown old-school style.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.840
They aren’t using fertilizers to control
weeds or pesticides to ward off insects - they

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.920
use natural (non-chemical) means that promote
water and soil conservation while creating

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.320
less pollution.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.050
Conventional methods use all that stuff and
thus are able to grow a lot more food a lot

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.050
more quickly.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.719
While organic and conventional produce look
pretty much the same, organic is often more

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:41.719
expensive.

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:45.519
SO...the question is….what are you paying
for and is it worth the dollas?

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:49.149
At the end of the day, the answer to that
question comes down to personal priorities

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.360
and budget, but here’s a rundown of what
the studies say.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.859
A controversial study that came out of Stanford
in 2012 found that there was no significant

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:58.870
nutritional difference between organic and
conventional produce.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.660
The scientists hand-selected 237 studies to
analyze and found a few key outcomes: (1)

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.430
No difference in vitamin, protein, or fat
content, (2) no evidence of health risks with

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.920
conventional produce, but (3) conventional
produce has a 30% increased risk of pesticide

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.920
contamination.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.390
They also found that children who eat conventional
produce have more pesticide residues in their

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.890
pee and exposure to higher levels of antibiotic-resistant
bacteria.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.470
The study was WIDELY criticized by the scientific
community for using faulty methods and leaving

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.880
several really important studies about nutritional
content out of their analysis.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.350
Fast forward to 2014, and the British Journal
of Nutrition has just released the largest

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.840
international analysis ever, covering 343
studies on organic produce.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.950
Their findings tell a slightly different story.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.640
The researchers found that organic produce
IS more nutritious -- and that it contains

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.420
up to 70% more antioxidants than conventionally
grown produce.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.200
They found that chemical fertilizers, which
allow vegetables to grow bigger and faster

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.840
with little effort, don’t allow for proportional
antioxidant development - so even though the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.390
veggies are bigger, the health benefits are
not the same.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.910
Antioxidants are developed as the vegetable
fights to survive and grow, so if they’re

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.959
protected by chemicals, you get a different
result.

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.340
The review also found that conventional produce
has more pesticides (duh), and up to 48% more

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.200
exposure to the toxic metal cadmium.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.621
I’ve done a lot of personal research on
this topic and it seems to me that organic

00:02:20.621 --> 00:02:25.090
has lots of health benefits and the widespread
use of antibiotics, pesticides, and chemical

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.840
fertilizers is very questionable.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.060
But conventional produce is still MUCH better
than no produce at all and you’re not on

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.239
the fast track to death by eating it.

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.540
If you’re on a budget and need to be choosy,
prioritize the fruits and veggies where you

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.540
eat the skin.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.910
Apples are a big one, strawberries, grapes,
tomatoes, and so forth.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.560
Let me know what you think about eating organic
down below and I’ll see you soon with more

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.810
science updates!
