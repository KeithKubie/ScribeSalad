00:00:04.814 --> 00:00:06.605
PAUL MURPHY: We started
Dots two years ago.

00:00:06.605 --> 00:00:08.880
And my co-founder
Patrick had this idea

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.240
to create an art-inspired game,
a game that we wanted to play.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.550
My name is Paul Murphy.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.050
I'm one of the co-founders
of Dots, and I'm the CEO.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.976
We launched Dots and we
had a lot of downloads.

00:00:21.976 --> 00:00:23.850
Millions of people
started playing this game.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.830
It was a little bit
overwhelming and we

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.315
had a lot of feature requests.

00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:28.690
BEN RUDLIN: My
name's Ben Rudlin.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.280
I'm the visual designer
on TwoDots at Dots.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.670
One of the hardest
challenges has

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.020
been trying to find that sweet
spot between functionality

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.720
and fun.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.890
But at the same time
from the UI perspective,

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.480
there's certain
communication that

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.907
has to be conveyed, so people
know what they're doing.

00:00:44.907 --> 00:00:46.990
CHRISTIAN CALDERON: My
name is Christian Calderon,

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.750
the head of marketing at Dots.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.530
Early on, some of the
qualitative measures

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:51.950
that we would look
at in the game

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.850
was just how people would
react to holding the phone

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.220
and connecting dots.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.880
The challenge with
that is it's not

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.510
scalable to do that over
70 different countries

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.330
with millions and
millions of players.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:03.470
TONY HE: My name's Tony He.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.379
I'm a data scientist at Dots.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.650
Google Play Experiments is
kind of a one-stop service

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.580
which enabled us to upload
different marketing assets.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.290
BEN RUDLIN: Icons, screenshots,
copy that goes with those,

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.819
and optimize the directions
that we go with those.

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:22.860
CHRISTIAN CALDERON: Google
Play Store Experiments

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.210
have helped us in two main ways.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.530
One is it had an impact on
helping us really understand

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.380
how changes that we make
impact user behaviour.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.430
Our control, the icon that
we had currently in the game,

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.200
had a white background,
and we tested that

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.930
with another icon that
had a black background.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.251
And what we realized
was that the icon

00:01:41.251 --> 00:01:43.500
with the white background
just performed a lot better.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.547
The second is just the
impact of the business.

00:01:45.547 --> 00:01:47.880
We've tested many different
things with out screenshots.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.240
The two largest ones
were illustrating

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.730
gameplay graphically.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.495
Also, illustrating
gameplay with text.

00:01:53.495 --> 00:01:55.730
And what we noticed
was that together, they

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.550
had a compound effect, a
positive effect on conversion

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.410
of about 8% when used localized.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.150
The experiments help us
become smarter at what we do.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.700
It also has a business impact.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.170
TONY HE: It is very easy to use.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.229
You don't need to implement
those analytical tracking.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.080
You don't need to worry
about segmentation.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.222
All of those things will
be done automatically.

00:02:15.222 --> 00:02:17.680
CHRISTIAN CALDERON: The advice
I'd give to other developers

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.570
is to always seek knowledge.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.596
Never stop trying
to learn new things.

00:02:21.596 --> 00:02:23.470
BEN RUDLIN: Don't be
afraid to make mistakes,

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.750
and to learn from them.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.166
PAUL MURPHY: Our
plan with Dots is

00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:27.760
to continue making
Dots-based games.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.450
We've created a
mechanic that we think

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.054
is unique, very creative-led.

00:02:31.054 --> 00:02:32.720
We find the creativity,
we find the fun,

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.270
and then we try to layer on the
business aspects afterwards.

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.320
