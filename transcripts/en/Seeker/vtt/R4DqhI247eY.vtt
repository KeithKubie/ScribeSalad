00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.810
Medical technology has two tiers -- we can
fix that, or we can't fix that.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.720
Spinal cord injuries might soon be on the
good list.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:18.210
Hey everybody, I'm Trace and you're plugged
in to DNews -- When human nerves are damaged,

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.040
they don't regenerate.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.630
Regeneration is different from healing.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.880
Healing leaves scars, but regeneration returns
the tissue to the pre-injured state.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.770
We're relatively low on the regenerative scale
-- our skin, toes, fingers, ribs, liver, pancreas,

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.630
kidneys, and smooth muscles are all able to
heal or regenerate.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.110
Nerves, neurons, skeletal muscles and the
heart all grow to a certain size and stop.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.329
Some of the most devastating injuries involve
long-term trauma and paralyzation of these

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.329
non-regenerative tissues.

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.730
When nerves in the spinal cord are severed,
the brain's commands never reach the muscle.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.630
It's like losing power to your house because
of a downed power line during a storm, but

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.320
in humans, we didn't USED to be able to put
that line back up... what if we could now?

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.540
Lower vertebrates like the sea lamprey have
regenerative nerves and spinal cords.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.470
Why do THEY get all the luck?!

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.549
Their brains are itty bitty!

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.770
Well, it has to do with a growth factor affecting
reticulospinal neuron cells in their brain

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.770
stem.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.900
The cells transmit messages on movement, and
when University of Missouri researchers hit

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.900
the cells with a natural molecule called cyclic
AMP -- the cells would begin to grow!

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.500
Cells which were already growing ignored the
cyclic AMP!

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.360
No side effects!

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.290
Researchers have been looking for factors
like this which appear in humans as well,

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.320
hoping we've GOT them, but our DNA had switched
them off for some reason.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.189
A study in Nature Communications found just
that!

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:47.870
A protein called P300/CBP-associated factor
(PCAF) seems to kick off the regeneration

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:48.870
in mice.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:55.210
With this discovery, we might be able to regrow
nerve cells in human peripheral nervous systems.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.939
When researchers introduced PCAF, epigenetic
factors switched on the regeneration mechanisms

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.790
in the cells causing 30% of the nerves to
grow back!

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.340
Epigenetics, for those who don't know, is
a process that can switch genes in the body

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.599
on and off without altering actual DNA strands.

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:16.680
This discovery is one more step on the way
to regrowing spinal cords after injury, but

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.849
it's only part of the battle...

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.470
ANOTHER study in the The Journal of Neuroscience
released this week uses gene therapy to fight

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.010
spinal injury.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.940
Researchers knew the enzyme (kon-droit-en-ase)
chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) will digest scar

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.230
tissue on nerves, but administering it to
the spine was very painful and the enzyme

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.340
dissipated quickly -- so repeated treatments
were necessary.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.810
So they taught the cells to produce their
own using gene therapy!

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:52.000
Gene therapy involves injecting a reprogrammed
retrovirus into the spinal cord cells to alter

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.330
cellular DNA -- in this case, it programmed
the spinal cord to release ChABC itself!

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.910
Thus, with only ONE INJECTION of ChABC, the
cells began to produce their own.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.681
The study was done in rats and TWELVE DAYS
LATER they were up and walking around, with

00:03:09.681 --> 00:03:11.310
scar-free spinal cords.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.480
Sounds like a miracle, but it's just science.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.280
Let's get this in humans, okay?

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.280
How do you feel about this?

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.280
Excited for the future?
