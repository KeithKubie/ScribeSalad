[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.699 --> 00:00:06.990
ANDREW BROGDON: Hey, everybody.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.590
Welcome back to
"The Boring Show."

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.800
I'm Andrew Brogdon from the
Flutter team, and with me is--

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.960
EMILY FORTUNA: Emily Fortuna,
also with the Flutter team.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:13.450
ANDREW BROGDON: Yes.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.230
It's the all-redhead dream team
that you've been waiting for.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.230
More ginger than
grandma's chana masala.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.490
Here we go.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.442
All right.

00:00:21.442 --> 00:00:23.400
So today, we're going to
continue our barometer

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.330
plug-in development.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.140
So last time, where
did we wrap it up?

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.364
We had a Dart interface, right?

00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:32.280
What else did we have?

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.960
EMILY FORTUNA: You could get
one reading or a single reading

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.907
when you press the button
to get your pressure.

00:00:38.907 --> 00:00:41.490
ANDREW BROGDON: OK, and we had
it implemented on Java, but not

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:42.079
on iOS.

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:42.870
EMILY FORTUNA: Yes.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.590
ANDREW BROGDON: OK.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:45.150
Well, cool.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.540
So next step-- let's get
it implemented for iOS

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.469
and show how that works.

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:53.010
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah,
so I think we'll

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.430
get it implemented in iOS,
then we can publish that just

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.070
so you all can see the
process for the through line.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.379
Now we recognize that the
current API is not ideal.

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.670
We probably don't just want
to get one pressure reading

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.795
and then be like, I'm good.

00:01:06.795 --> 00:01:07.878
ANDREW BROGDON: Peace out.

00:01:07.878 --> 00:01:09.660
EMILY FORTUNA: My
app knows pressure.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.620
So then, we'd like
to update our API

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.089
to have streams on the Android
and iOS, time allowing.

00:01:16.089 --> 00:01:18.630
ANDREW BROGDON: Flutter is all
about the reactive programming

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.500
and streams.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.460
Very native to Flutter.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.490
OK.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.450
EMILY FORTUNA: And we'll throw
in some questions-- or answers

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.405
to questions.

00:01:25.405 --> 00:01:26.280
Maybe some questions.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.910
ANDREW BROGDON:
Maybe some questions.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.440
EMILY FORTUNA: And
not answer them.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.565
ANDREW BROGDON: All right,
so that's a good review.

00:01:30.565 --> 00:01:32.110
Let's review the code, as well.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.570
So we had an app
here that was using--

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.820
let's start with the plug-ins.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.829
We had our barometer
plug-in, which was--

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.370
let me make this a
little bit bigger.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.650
Oh, too big.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.480
So it's very simple.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.315
It was just pulling a-- so I had
that leftover platform version

00:01:45.315 --> 00:01:47.440
getter in there, which we
should probably take out.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.150
EMILY FORTUNA: That will be
in our API cleanup after this.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.816
ANDREW BROGDON: We'll
take care of that.

00:01:50.816 --> 00:01:53.100
But it had get barometer
and initialize barometer,

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.230
and so it was initializing
the barometer.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:01.440
And then in Java land, it was
just kind of kicking off--

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.720
when you initialized, it
would go get the sensor,

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.150
register a listener that would
update a little variable,

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.920
and then any time you
called in to get the value,

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.910
it would just be like, oh,
here's the latest value.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.030
EMILY FORTUNA: Here's--
yeah, it's the current one.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.570
ANDREW BROGDON: I
have one right here.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.528
EMILY FORTUNA: And all
of this is tied together

00:02:13.528 --> 00:02:17.604
with your method
channels, so we're just

00:02:17.604 --> 00:02:19.229
kind of doing a little
message passing.

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:20.728
ANDREW BROGDON: So
we have on method

00:02:20.728 --> 00:02:23.350
call right here, where we're
checking the method that Dart

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.250
is trying to call and then
returning a result based

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.470
on which method it is and
calling the right Java

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.560
function in response.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.912
So I basically need to go
implement this in iOS land.

00:02:34.912 --> 00:02:36.120
EMILY FORTUNA: Piece of cake.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.800
ANDREW BROGDON:
Yeah, no problem.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.430
I have literally days
of iOS experiences.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.290
This will be fun.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.270
So much like the plug-in
has an Android folder,

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.384
it also has an iOS
folder, and one

00:02:48.384 --> 00:02:50.550
of the nice things you can
do is right click on that

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.781
or double click with two
fingers and open in Xcode.

00:02:54.781 --> 00:02:57.030
EMILY FORTUNA: And before
you dive into this too much,

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.930
I just want to reiterate
that plug-in development is

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.420
a probably more advanced
topic than you would need

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.450
for your average Flutter app.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.540
In an ideal world and probably
most times in practice,

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.640
you're just going to be
able to write your app

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.030
and then say, oh, I need a
plug-in to do X. And then you

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.640
search, and someone will have
already implemented it for you.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.630
This is in the rare off case
that you need to emergency

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.039
measure air pressure.

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:25.080
No one has done that yet.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.130
ANDREW BROGDON: You're
in a hot air balloon

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.485
and you need to
calculate how high you

00:03:27.485 --> 00:03:28.606
are-- something like that.

00:03:28.606 --> 00:03:30.480
EMILY FORTUNA: Shooting
off in a rocket ship.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.712
Important issues.

00:03:31.712 --> 00:03:34.170
ANDREW BROGDON: This is-- we're
interacting with a platform

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.510
API, and for platform
APIs, you kind of

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.300
have to talk to the
platform for that.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.508
There's no getting around it.

00:03:39.508 --> 00:03:41.350
But I imagine as
Flutter matures,

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.260
you'll start seeing
more and more dedicated,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.190
written in Dart SDKs for
things like network services

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.014
and things like that.

00:03:49.014 --> 00:03:50.430
So that's something
I look forward

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.370
to seeing in the future.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:52.440
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah, but
this is in that rare case

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.560
that, yeah, you're
taking a trip to space.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.970
You need your air pressure.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.770
We can help you see how
to do a plug-in for that.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:59.853
ANDREW BROGDON: All right.

00:03:59.853 --> 00:04:04.920
Let me see about setting
up the font size for this.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.690
There we go.

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.140
Hello, code.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.770
OK, so this is the iOS
version of the plug-in

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.469
that we were just looking
at in Android land.

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:17.510
EMILY FORTUNA: In Objective-C,
we should mention.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.709
You can program your
plug-ins in Swift and Kotlin.

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.287
We're doing Objective-C and
Java for this particular case.

00:04:25.287 --> 00:04:26.370
ANDREW BROGDON: All right.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.980
So what are we doing here?

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.577
We've got the barometer plug-in
class, and that's being--

00:04:31.577 --> 00:04:33.410
we have a register
with-- register our class

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.720
method that's getting
called, and that's

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.220
making a method channel.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.570
So here's that barometer name.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.570
If you remember, back
in our Dart code,

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.812
we had a method channel
we called barometer.

00:04:45.812 --> 00:04:47.270
So here, we're
spinning up the sort

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.940
of other end of that channel
to listen for messages,

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.340
and we make an instance of
the barometer plug-in class

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.589
to handle the actual work and
add a method call delegate.

00:04:56.589 --> 00:04:58.880
So we've got this that kind
of sets things up, and then

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.780
here's an instance method that's
handling the method calls--

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.430
very similar to what we
saw in Java, looks like.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.920
So let's get right into it.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.670
I've got to add some
stuff to this, right?

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.080
So I need to add--

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.880
just like before, I
need to add some things.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.440
So if-- what are
our methods called?

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.630
That would be a good
thing for me to remember.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:21.500
I think initialize barometer.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.000
EMILY FORTUNA:
Initialize barometer,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.600
and then I think it's
just reading, I think,

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.522
is what we called the other.

00:05:28.522 --> 00:05:29.579
I will pull it up.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.345
ANDREW BROGDON: Oop, got
an extra bracket in there.

00:05:42.345 --> 00:05:44.317
It's equal to string
called up method.

00:05:44.317 --> 00:05:45.303
Take you out.

00:05:50.233 --> 00:05:52.210
There we go.

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.790
And so that's going
to do some stuff,

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.450
and then I need another
one of these constructions

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:01.851
for the next one.

00:06:01.851 --> 00:06:03.775
EMILY FORTUNA: Yes.

00:06:03.775 --> 00:06:08.640
And I need to see.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.600
Yeah, which is-- we were
calling it get barometer.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.370
ANDREW BROGDON: OK, so I
have initialize barometer

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.400
and get barometer.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.590
And so these are checking
the name of the method

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.210
that Dart is attempting to
call, and then we need to do--

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:23.085
EMILY FORTUNA: Stuff.

00:06:23.085 --> 00:06:24.861
ANDREW BROGDON: Stuff.

00:06:24.861 --> 00:06:25.360
So--

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.735
EMILY FORTUNA:
We're done, right?

00:06:26.735 --> 00:06:28.290
ANDREW BROGDON:
Yeah, piece of cake.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.950
So let's see.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:30.240
We're going to need--

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.290
how does the barometer work?

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:37.220
This is our old code,
which I was checking out.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:42.150
It's CMAltimeter, I
believe, from Core Motion

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.046
is what we're looking for.

00:06:44.046 --> 00:06:47.940
And so an object that
initiates a delivery

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.460
of altitude-related changes.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:51.690
That sounds fancy.

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:54.500
And so I think this is the
equivalent of a sensor that

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.089
would be accessing on Android.

00:06:59.089 --> 00:06:59.880
So we have a class.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.530
We'll need to instantiate one
of these and we'll need to--

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:07.800
ah-- start relative
altitude updates.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.360
EMILY FORTUNA: Seems like
what we're interested in.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.010
ANDREW BROGDON:
OK, so let's just--

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:15.890
OK, let's declare some--

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:17.800
we can put instance
variables in, right?

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:18.917
I vars.

00:07:18.917 --> 00:07:19.750
EMILY FORTUNA: Sure.

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:20.625
ANDREW BROGDON: Yeah.

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:24.960
So we'll want an--

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.224
what does this return in?

00:07:29.224 --> 00:07:30.890
So if you recall from
last time, there's

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:38.070
this chart for Flutter that
tells you what the types are

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:39.160
for platform channels.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:39.840
EMILY FORTUNA: Oh, for
responding between--

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.820
ANDREW BROGDON:
Yeah, so let me see.

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.190
So I want a double on
the Dart side, so what

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:48.500
do I need to give
it on the iOS side?

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.460
Already zoomed in and
everything because I

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.200
was showing this last time.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:56.244
So if I want a double,
I need an NSNumber--

00:07:56.244 --> 00:07:57.035
number with double.

00:07:57.035 --> 00:08:01.930
OK, so let's make an
NSNumber point or two

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:04.400
and call it pressure.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.170
So that can be the thing
that we just keep updating,

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:09.270
and then I need an altimeter.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.762
I'm scared because it's
not recognizing that.

00:08:15.762 --> 00:08:17.970
EMILY FORTUNA: Do we need
to import something, maybe?

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:20.960
ANDREW BROGDON: Oh, I bet we do.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.050
I'm guessing Core Motion because
it's part of Core Motion.

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:26.020
OK, so I can come up here.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.684
That's a framework,
so I do this.

00:08:28.684 --> 00:08:34.443
Oh, import Core
Motion like that.

00:08:34.443 --> 00:08:35.270
We good?

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:36.220
We're good!

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:38.240
OK, so I imported a class.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.089
OK, so that's good.

00:08:42.089 --> 00:08:43.380
EMILY FORTUNA: Newbie question.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:48.320
So someone who has not really
programmed much Objective-C.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.170
Is this like a class?

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:54.790
Is this-- I guess my, like,
oh no, global variables sense

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:55.290
is tingling.

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:56.047
ANDREW BROGDON: Oh, that's true.

00:08:56.047 --> 00:08:57.213
EMILY FORTUNA: But I don't--

00:08:57.213 --> 00:08:59.030
maybe that's--

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:01.820
ANDREW BROGDON: It's probably
tingling for a reason.

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:04.250
I believe that
these are variables

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:06.740
that will be one per class.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:08.190
I don't know that for a fact.

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:10.870
EMILY FORTUNA:
OK, well, we can--

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:11.870
we'll start it this way.

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:13.694
We will get the code
out, and then we can--

00:09:13.694 --> 00:09:15.860
ANDREW BROGDON: I don't
think it's possible for them

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.370
to spin up two instances
of the plug-in, which

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:22.054
means even if we haven't
properly done this

00:09:22.054 --> 00:09:24.470
and we're polluting the global
name-space on the iOS side,

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:27.020
there's no chance that
we can pollute it twice.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:27.907
But that's a good--

00:09:27.907 --> 00:09:28.490
you know what?

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:30.470
I bet we have commenters
that will tell us

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:33.350
exactly what's going
on, just like we

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:37.310
had someone that
explained what I had not

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:40.240
seen on the pressure sensor.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.130
Do we have-- is that
on our list of comments

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:44.380
that we were going to mention?

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:45.080
EMILY FORTUNA: Yes.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.663
ANDREW BROGDON:
Somebody mentioned it.

00:09:46.663 --> 00:09:49.310
EMILY FORTUNA: So
Fuad Khan-- and I'm--

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:50.920
ANDREW BROGDON: There we go.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.805
We'll put a graphic, so--

00:09:52.805 --> 00:09:54.790
EMILY FORTUNA: Pointed
out that Andrew

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:57.170
was missing through
the additional sensors,

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:59.130
and we will-- when
we're doing Android,

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:00.910
we can simulate the
different pressures.

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:01.785
ANDREW BROGDON: Yeah.

00:10:01.785 --> 00:10:04.640
I missed this conveniently
named additional sensors tab

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.930
right here that was
still on the path.

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:10.291
So we learn from you, as well.

00:10:10.291 --> 00:10:10.790
OK.

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:15.710
So someone can tell us if
instance variables are not

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:17.070
a good idea there.

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:19.040
In the meantime, I'm
going to use one.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.120
We're going to press
on because we--

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.120
EMILY FORTUNA: Progress.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.340
ANDREW BROGDON: Yeah,
we're coding without a net.

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.045
Not a lot of preparating here.

00:10:28.045 --> 00:10:29.170
EMILY FORTUNA: Preparating.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:29.890
ANDREW BROGDON: Preparating.

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:30.640
Yeah.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.130
OK, so we need to
make an altimeter.

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:37.310
Stay on task, as all of my
teachers used to tell me.

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:45.570
So we'll need to allocate
and initialize that,

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:49.350
and then we'll need to
subscribe to updates, right?

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:52.640
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah, and
that function was called--

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.435
we just had that.

00:10:54.435 --> 00:10:54.935
Start.

00:10:54.935 --> 00:10:57.620
ANDREW BROGDON: Start relative
altitude updates, too,

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.410
and it takes a
queue and a handler,

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:03.160
which are words I
have heard before.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.680
EMILY FORTUNA: Operation queue.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.055
ANDREW BROGDON:
OK, so it's going

00:11:06.055 --> 00:11:08.175
to take an operation queue.

00:11:08.175 --> 00:11:08.675
OK.

00:11:08.675 --> 00:11:12.306
So let's see.

00:11:12.306 --> 00:11:13.755
EMILY FORTUNA: Altimeter.

00:11:13.755 --> 00:11:16.170
ANDREW BROGDON: Altimeter.

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:18.104
Start.

00:11:18.104 --> 00:11:18.895
EMILY FORTUNA: Yes.

00:11:18.895 --> 00:11:20.080
ANDREW BROGDON: Relative.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.090
OK.

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:24.580
So I'm guessing I can do--

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:28.385
and there's a main-- there's
always a main everything.

00:11:28.385 --> 00:11:29.010
So we got that.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.380
You make that block--
paint the block for me.

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:36.880
There we go.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.630
OK.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:40.540
Let me clean that up.

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:43.467
And so that made a block for
me, which is very helpful.

00:11:43.467 --> 00:11:46.050
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah, so this is
our sort of call back handler.

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:49.619
ANDREW BROGDON: Right, so
we're giving it a block,

00:11:49.619 --> 00:11:51.660
and that's going to get
an altitude data, as well

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.580
as an error.

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.500
We'll just assume
everything's fine

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.010
and just use the altitude data.

00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:57.510
So--

00:11:57.510 --> 00:11:59.051
EMILY FORTUNA: Best
coding practices.

00:11:59.051 --> 00:11:59.940
No error checking.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:01.731
ANDREW BROGDON: Yeah,
it's a piece of cake.

00:12:01.731 --> 00:12:05.780
So altitude data dot--

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:08.070
whoa.

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:09.270
Drag source descriptors.

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.720
Probably not what
we're looking for.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:12.220
Is there--

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:13.800
EMILY FORTUNA: Is there like a--

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:14.883
ANDREW BROGDON: Let's do--

00:12:14.883 --> 00:12:15.570
OK.

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:16.070
There we go.

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:16.570
OK.

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:17.910
EMILY FORTUNA: Pressure.

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:19.955
ANDREW BROGDON:
And what are you?

00:12:19.955 --> 00:12:20.454
OK.

00:12:20.454 --> 00:12:20.953
Here.

00:12:20.953 --> 00:12:22.360
There you go.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.367
What are you?

00:12:24.367 --> 00:12:25.950
Can I jump to
definition of something?

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:26.687
Ooh.

00:12:26.687 --> 00:12:27.520
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.910
ANDREW BROGDON: So
that's an NSNumber.

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:32.586
Pressure and kilopascals.

00:12:32.586 --> 00:12:37.230
EMILY FORTUNA: And what was the
measurement for the pressure

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:38.710
in our Android one?

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:40.281
Do you remember?

00:12:40.281 --> 00:12:41.780
ANDREW BROGDON: I
know it was 1,000.

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:43.196
EMILY FORTUNA: Was
it kilopascals?

00:12:43.196 --> 00:12:44.740
ANDREW BROGDON: I don't know.

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:45.930
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah,
we'll just program--

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:47.010
I was wondering for units.

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:48.130
ANDREW BROGDON: No,
please go for it.

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:49.050
EMILY FORTUNA: I'll look
at it while you're--

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:51.341
ANDREW BROGDON: No, that's
an important thing to check.

00:12:51.341 --> 00:12:53.940
So we could-- occasionally, when
you're doing platform stuff,

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:54.750
you're going to
have platforms that

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:55.916
behave slightly differently.

00:12:55.916 --> 00:13:00.030
So in this case, if Android uses
one unit and iOS uses another,

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:01.460
and they're--

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:04.020
there's a constant that
you have to multiply by--

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:07.359
centigrade to Fahrenheit
or something like that--

00:13:07.359 --> 00:13:09.150
those sorts of
conversions-- you definitely

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:12.120
want to be aware of that.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.660
For right now, I'll just press
on, assuming this is good.

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:17.200
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah, I'll let
you know if I see something.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.700
ANDREW BROGDON: So that's going
to initialize the barometer,

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:21.400
and then here, we would just--

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:21.900
oh, wait.

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:22.920
We need to return something.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:23.640
I remember that.

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:27.030
This expects a Boolean.

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:35.124
So let's do result. What
is a Boolean in this?

00:13:35.124 --> 00:13:36.290
That's a good thing to know.

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:38.930
EMILY FORTUNA: Is it NSBool
or something like that?

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:41.287
ANDREW BROGDON: Boolean
is an NSNumber with Bool.

00:13:41.287 --> 00:13:42.870
EMILY FORTUNA: Oh,
it's just NSNumber.

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:43.690
That's the variable--

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:44.860
ANDREW BROGDON: That's
the constructor, right?

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:45.745
Or the initializer?

00:13:45.745 --> 00:13:46.490
EMILY FORTUNA: Oh, OK.

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:47.500
I thought that was
just the variable name.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:48.640
My bad.

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.650
This is why I'm not
programming this right now.

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:57.960
ANDREW BROGDON: OK,
NSNumber, which is a term

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.800
that I've heard, and--

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.630
so number with Bool.

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:04.540
OK.

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:06.640
And then yes.

00:14:13.225 --> 00:14:18.570
That looks like
reasonable code, I think.

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:19.419
OK.

00:14:19.419 --> 00:14:21.210
And then we still need
to fill in this one.

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:25.110
So initialize barometer is
going to make the altimeter.

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:29.070
Subscribe to it for updates and
update the pressure any time

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:30.510
it gets an update.

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.970
And then get barometer
needs to return

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.430
the number that it's updating.

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:38.460
Can I just do this?

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:42.820
EMILY FORTUNA: That would be--

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:44.290
ANDREW BROGDON: No!

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:45.006
No, I cannot.

00:14:45.006 --> 00:14:45.922
EMILY FORTUNA: Return.

00:14:45.922 --> 00:14:48.580
Hm.

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:56.458
So do we need to put it in
the thing that we're-- oh,

00:14:56.458 --> 00:14:56.997
there we go.

00:14:56.997 --> 00:14:58.830
ANDREW BROGDON: I'm not
returning something.

00:14:58.830 --> 00:14:59.440
I'm--

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.480
EMILY FORTUNA: Passing
the result to be returned.

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.830
ANDREW BROGDON:
Passing the result. OK.

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:04.915
Because not all six letter
words that begin with R

00:15:04.915 --> 00:15:08.140
are the same, as far
as Xcode is concerned.

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:09.730
So I can save this now.

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:14.440
I could actually-- there is a
module project you can actually

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:16.480
run from within
Xcode, but I'm going

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.790
to go back to our Flutter
code here and run from here.

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:27.430
So let's-- OK, got an iPhone
X. Let's see what we got.

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:33.984
Now before, it would have
crashed because it would have--

00:15:33.984 --> 00:15:36.150
the first thing that happens
is initialize barometer

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:36.830
gets called.

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:37.460
EMILY FORTUNA: Try to call
that, and it's like, nope.

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.043
ANDREW BROGDON: Yeah,
and the iOS code

00:15:39.043 --> 00:15:40.750
would have-- before
we added this bit,

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:41.540
it would have been
like, I don't know

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.080
what the heck you're
talking about,

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.106
and it would have
immediately crashed.

00:15:45.106 --> 00:15:45.980
It might still crash.

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:46.479
We'll see.

00:15:50.022 --> 00:15:51.730
EMILY FORTUNA: Well,
that's a good start.

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:52.170
ANDREW BROGDON: All right.

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:52.670
That's cool.

00:15:54.871 --> 00:15:55.370
Oh.

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:56.640
That--

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:57.704
EMILY FORTUNA: Hooray!

00:15:57.704 --> 00:15:59.120
ANDREW BROGDON:
That is less cool.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.120
EMILY FORTUNA:
We're in a vacuum.

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.119
ANDREW BROGDON: I'm
surprised that didn't crash.

00:16:02.119 --> 00:16:05.270
Kudos to whoever saved me
and put a two-string method

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:05.770
on null.

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:08.210
Thank you for that.

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:11.130
EMILY FORTUNA: So OK,
here's the question, though.

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:14.430
I think you were saying
that there is no--

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:18.830
you can't-- there's no simulator
for pressure with the iOS

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:19.330
simulator.

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:20.705
ANDREW BROGDON:
Oh, that's right.

00:16:20.705 --> 00:16:21.810
There might not be one.

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:22.726
EMILY FORTUNA: Is it--

00:16:22.726 --> 00:16:24.380
are we getting null because--

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:25.080
yeah.

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.707
Or is it because it's our fault?

00:16:26.707 --> 00:16:27.540
That's the question.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:28.620
ANDREW BROGDON: OK, so I did--

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:29.700
I was worried about that.

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:32.760
I know on Android,
because someone told me

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:39.330
exactly where to go to mess
with the pressure stuff

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:40.460
and I did bring--

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:43.210
I actually have a hardware
device this time, just in case.

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:44.430
So let's--

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:46.290
EMILY FORTUNA:
Test that, and then

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:48.800
we can know whether it's us or--

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.310
ANDREW BROGDON: OK, so let's
go back to Android studio,

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:53.910
ironically enough.

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:59.437
Let's stop and let's
try my hardware device

00:16:59.437 --> 00:17:00.520
and see what we get there.

00:17:06.851 --> 00:17:07.716
Is this thing on?

00:17:07.716 --> 00:17:08.216
Oh, hey.

00:17:08.216 --> 00:17:11.551
It's on and it's getting
updates from news sites.

00:17:11.551 --> 00:17:12.050
That's nice.

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:17.210
EMILY FORTUNA: Do you
have a mirroring thing?

00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:18.890
ANDREW BROGDON: I do not.

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:21.010
I can take a picture
of this with my Pixel.

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:22.210
So we could do that.

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:23.210
Like this has the real--

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:24.790
EMILY FORTUNA: Lo-fi everything.

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:26.206
ANDREW BROGDON:
She's right there.

00:17:26.206 --> 00:17:27.500
It's the real device.

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:28.310
OK.

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:31.940
So that's 101.

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:32.990
That's interesting.

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:36.680
EMILY FORTUNA: And we had 1,000.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.764
ANDREW BROGDON: It was 1,013.

00:17:38.764 --> 00:17:39.680
So what are the units?

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.810
Did you actually get a
chance to look this up?

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:44.600
EMILY FORTUNA: I got distracted.

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.130
ANDREW BROGDON:
Probably helping me.

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:48.143
EMILY FORTUNA: Let's see here.

00:17:48.143 --> 00:18:00.120
So we have this sensor
manager-- sensor--

00:18:03.592 --> 00:18:05.800
ANDREW BROGDON: We got the
recording going over here.

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.133
Let me see what I can find, too.

00:18:07.133 --> 00:18:13.540
So sensor-- let's just do
pressure Android sensor

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:15.450
and see what comes up.

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:18.650
Environment sensors.

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:23.650
EMILY FORTUNA: Oh,
millibar-- hectopascals.

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:24.694
ANDREW BROGDON: hPa.

00:18:24.694 --> 00:18:25.485
EMILY FORTUNA: Yes.

00:18:25.485 --> 00:18:28.160
ANDREW BROGDON: OK, that sounds
like a stock ticker symbol.

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:28.660
OK.

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:32.560
EMILY FORTUNA: And then on iOS--

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:36.670
ANDREW BROGDON: So
hPa is 100 pascals.

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:39.370
Hectopascal.

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:42.720
I think I killed
one of those playing

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.730
Dungeons and Dragons once.

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:45.330
Hectopascal.

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:47.540
OK, so that's 100 pascals.

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:49.750
Do we know back here?

00:18:53.331 --> 00:18:56.642
EMILY FORTUNA: Didn't it say--

00:18:56.642 --> 00:18:59.556
ANDREW BROGDON: OK, it's
got to be on here somewhere.

00:18:59.556 --> 00:19:02.304
EMILY FORTUNA: Same altitude.

00:19:02.304 --> 00:19:03.298
I'll search again.

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:16.360
Core Motion sounds like
an exercise routine.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.442
ANDREW BROGDON: Well,
there's a CMAltitude data.

00:19:18.442 --> 00:19:19.770
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah, that's
what I'm looking at right now.

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:20.600
ANDREW BROGDON: Oh,
you're already--

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:21.266
already have it.

00:19:21.266 --> 00:19:23.345
EMILY FORTUNA: I
need the actual--

00:19:23.345 --> 00:19:24.275
what is the value.

00:19:24.275 --> 00:19:25.492
Oh, kilopascals.

00:19:25.492 --> 00:19:27.280
There we go.

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:29.680
ANDREW BROGDON: OK, so
kilopascals versus--

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:30.846
EMILY FORTUNA: Hectopascals.

00:19:30.846 --> 00:19:32.510
So we're off by an
order of magnitude.

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:33.500
ANDREW BROGDON: OK.

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:36.980
EMILY FORTUNA: So that would be
why we've got 100 versus 1,000.

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:38.524
ANDREW BROGDON: OK, so--

00:19:38.524 --> 00:19:40.940
EMILY FORTUNA: So the question
is, which do we want to do?

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:42.680
ANDREW BROGDON: Yeah, so we're
in the iOS code right now,

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.138
so it would be easy
to change that.

00:19:44.138 --> 00:19:48.980
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah, and I
also feel like, from my--

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:52.930
because I'm such an
air pressure expert,

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:56.660
I feel like the 1,013 is--
that's like sea level.

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:58.340
That's like the
more standard way

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:00.090
that I normally see it recorded.

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:02.540
ANDREW BROGDON: I will take
your nautical knowledge.

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:04.039
This will also be
fun because people

00:20:04.039 --> 00:20:07.370
got to watch me try and
do math with an NSNumber.

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:12.950
So first, we want to get
the double value of it,

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:14.300
and then multiply that--

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:14.810
EMILY FORTUNA: Times 2.

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:17.351
ANDREW BROGDON: But then we have
to make another NSNumber out

00:20:17.351 --> 00:20:20.120
of it, I think.

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.810
So NSNumber.

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:27.840
Number with Bool-- with double.

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.130
Does that work?

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:33.270
Let's save.

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:41.295
Go back to Android studio
and stop and start.

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:50.183
EMILY FORTUNA: Real time
recording happening now.

00:20:50.183 --> 00:20:51.016
ANDREW BROGDON: Yep.

00:20:51.016 --> 00:20:53.481
Here we go.

00:20:53.481 --> 00:20:54.467
So there's my code.

00:20:54.467 --> 00:20:55.925
EMILY FORTUNA:
Build, build, build.

00:20:59.025 --> 00:21:01.400
ANDREW BROGDON: I borrowed
this device from the Test Lab.

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:05.040
It's all just Flutter icons from
various sample apps and test

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:06.080
apps that people made.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.455
EMILY FORTUNA: It's like we've
been working or something.

00:21:08.455 --> 00:21:10.504
ANDREW BROGDON:
Yeah, so there we go.

00:21:10.504 --> 00:21:12.920
This is-- I'm sure the video
production people in the room

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.480
are very happy to see me
doing this, by the way.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.690
There's our latest reading.

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:20.144
EMILY FORTUNA: OK, so
nothing and 1,000--

00:21:20.144 --> 00:21:21.060
ANDREW BROGDON: 1,013.

00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:21.560
All right.

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.040
EMILY FORTUNA: Woo hoo!

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:26.867
And we're around sea level
and that kind of makes sense.

00:21:26.867 --> 00:21:27.950
ANDREW BROGDON: All right.

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:28.450
So--

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:29.960
EMILY FORTUNA: Nicely done.

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:30.570
Ship it!

00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:31.940
ANDREW BROGDON: Yeah.

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:32.600
Piece of cake.

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:33.225
End of episode.

00:21:33.225 --> 00:21:34.550
No.

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:37.110
All right, so that's
task one down for today.

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:42.230
So we just finished up
adding just the iOS code

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:44.780
underneath the Dart
interface that we'd written.

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:47.680
So it was just opening
up some files in Xcode,

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.430
adding a little bit
of code here to handle

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:51.330
those methods, interact
with the platform,

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:53.330
which was the purpose
of the plug-in,

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:57.743
and then shipping those
numbers back to Dart land.

00:21:57.743 --> 00:22:00.150
EMILY FORTUNA: So I think
we are ready to share

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:01.220
this with the world.

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:01.570
ANDREW BROGDON: All right.

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:02.930
So you want to get
started publishing it?

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:03.721
EMILY FORTUNA: Yes.

00:22:03.721 --> 00:22:05.090
ANDREW BROGDON: All right.

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:07.540
