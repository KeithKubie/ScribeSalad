00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.230
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:04.570
I swear I could do
this all night long.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.426
Can we do this, Dana?

00:00:06.426 --> 00:00:08.378
Any House heads in here?

00:00:08.378 --> 00:00:09.354
[CHEERING]

00:00:09.354 --> 00:00:11.310
Dana, we've got to pick
it up a little bit.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:11.825
So listen.

00:00:11.825 --> 00:00:13.020
Craig is in the house.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.690
Craig, would you wave
your hand real quick?

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.910
So one of the first songs
my partner and I, Dana,

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.800
wrote was a song
called "Stalk You."

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.802
So I'm just going to
sing a little bit of it.

00:00:22.802 --> 00:00:23.885
I want you all to hear it.

00:00:23.885 --> 00:00:26.176
I actually traveled
to Japan with Craig.

00:00:26.176 --> 00:00:27.664
Do you remember that?

00:00:27.664 --> 00:00:30.144
In the name of Jesus.

00:00:30.144 --> 00:00:32.689
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:33.580
So this is the song.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.120
Listen.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.661
[MUSIC - AVERY
SUNSHINE, "STALK YOU"]

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.740
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.240
I just had to give
you a little bit.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.790
I love you.
