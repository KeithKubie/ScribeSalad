up from your coma!

00:00:15.381 --> 00:00:17.617
- Oh my god, what did I miss?

00:00:17.617 --> 00:00:18.784
- Well I'm really
glad you asked,

00:00:18.784 --> 00:00:20.353 align:start size:88% position:13%
because I got into Har--
- Movies!

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:21.286
You gotta tell me about
the movies that I missed.

00:00:21.286 --> 00:00:22.688
I've been in a coma a long time.

00:00:22.688 --> 00:00:24.390
- Um, I just saw Spider-Man.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.758

Andrew Garfield?

00:00:25.758 --> 00:00:27.894
- No, it's a reboot
with Tom Holland.

00:00:27.894 --> 00:00:28.961
- A three-boot?

00:00:28.961 --> 00:00:30.229
We get it.

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:31.865
His uncle's dead,
what else is out?

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:32.898
- Um, I don't know.

00:00:32.898 --> 00:00:33.866
Kong?

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:35.567
- Kong, King Kong?

00:00:35.567 --> 00:00:36.535
That stinker with Jack Black?

00:00:36.535 --> 00:00:37.870
They made another one? Ugh.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.739
- No, it's a second reboot.

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.709 align:start position:0%
And then the next one he's gonna
like, fight Godzilla, okay?

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:45.645
- They're three-bootin'
King Kong and Godzilla?

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:47.280
Jesus Christ, we get it!

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.615
They hate helicopters.

00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:50.216
What else came out?

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:51.650

please just listen to me?

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.052

00:00:53.052 --> 00:00:54.720
- No, with Tom Cruise, okay?

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.955
They three-booted that too.

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:56.789
Are you happy?

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.257
- Never, Tom Cruise?!

00:00:58.257 --> 00:01:01.060
Who reboots a movie
with an older actor?!

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.328
- Just shut up!

00:01:02.328 --> 00:01:04.063
I got a scholarship to
an Ivy League school!

00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:05.565
Aren't you proud of me?!

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:08.501 align:start size:97% position:3%
Look, I even bought you this
sweatshirt, you ass face!

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:09.735
- It's not personal,

00:01:09.735 --> 00:01:10.836
I'm very proud of you.

00:01:10.836 --> 00:01:12.404
Thank you for the sweatshirt!

00:01:12.404 --> 00:01:14.941 align:start size:84% position:16%
I've just been in a
coma a very long time,

00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:17.610
and I gotta know what
else is three-booted!

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.246
I hate three-boots,
what else came out?!

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:22.649
(breathing heavily)

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:25.084 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Lego Batman,

00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:28.254

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:29.755
(crying)

00:01:29.755 --> 00:01:32.592
- And Justice League is
coming out this year too.

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:36.529 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Rebooting two Batmans
at the same time?!

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:38.931

(heart monitor beeps quickly)

00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:39.765
(heart monitor flatlines)

00:01:39.765 --> 00:01:44.003
- Oh Dad, oh god, geez.

00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:45.304
- Stand back! Clear!

00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:55.849
