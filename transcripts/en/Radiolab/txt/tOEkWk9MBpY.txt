Speaker 2:          00:25          Hey, I'm Janet. Boom. Ryan. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab this hour. Our topic is diagnosis. This next story begins with a dad, two sons and a question. What do you do when you notice somebody different? I heard it from reporter to Gregory, right?

Speaker 3:          00:39          Hello. Hi Gregory. [inaudible] nice to meet. Nice to meet you in case. Just so you know, it took me over a year. You can sit down and you to finally get an interview with Byron France. I'm wondering if the air, I can turn the dead in their story and I'm up in his apartment in the South Bronx. You'll have skills, all this loose paperwork. Are you just, are you moving out or are you moving? It looks bad. Look like that. Was that messy? I don't want to put this [inaudible] boxes everywhere. Crazy piles of stuff. Okay, let go. Don't worry about [inaudible]. Yeah, sorry. [inaudible] it's in disarray. There's who? So who is this gun? I A, I'm a retired electrical engineer. I work for subway most of his life now. I consider myself a science researcher and it's 71 years old. He's basically teaching himself onto physics. That's what all the books and stuff you see around. I love that stuff. And he's written this book called Einstein's era, criticizing special relativity. Einstein. I sent it to the New York Academy of Science at Caltech, MIT, Harvard, even Hawkins. Still waiting for him to get back. Most people just ignore them. These are the rabies of maniac. But then he points to this letter on the wall. Yeah. From Neil degrasse Tyson. I know that name. This major scientist. Yes. Ahead of the Hayden Planetarium in Manhattan. Exactly. Yes. Yeah. And it says, how dare you. You're just an engineer

Speaker 3:          02:04          and he's beaming. You know why? Why do you smile when, when, when you talk about that letter from Neil degrasse Tyson, because I know how foolish it is. Einstein, they didn't even want to read his paper. He said, who is this guy up spot? He just a patent examination clerk. And Bern Byron banners is a man who's proud to go against the grain. The what other people do. I don't really do. And that's especially true with how he raised his son. So now a Gregory, you're gonna do, uh, some kind of a story on the manuals. Youngest son, right? Emmanuel. Okay. And that's why I'm here focusing to question him about how he raised his son. That'd be glad to. Okay, great. So here's the manual.

Speaker 2:          02:47          Hi, I'm Emmanuel [inaudible]. Amanda, could you take a drink of water for me? Just okay. Thank you. No, it don't take me. Yeah, take as many drinks of water. He's 28. So what things are you good at? Manual, um, writing essays and making sure they aren't grammatically correct bowling. And as you can hear analyzing stuff, there is something going on with them.

Speaker 4:          03:14          Um, and, and,

Speaker 2:          03:20          and not talking that much. Yes.

Speaker 5:          03:22          Now if you ask dad, he'll say manuals and excellent student. Our Future, no balance. It's gonna win a Nobel prize. You never know, but if you ask Blair, I'm Blair frown or is that Emmanuel's half-brother? I'm about 20 years old and then Emmanuel, he'll tell you that even as a little kid, very, very like five years old. There was something, oh, I didn't, I just didn't know what it was. It's a bunch of little things.

Speaker 6:          03:45          Yeah, like if you'd look at you really weird, kind of like a doll face expression. He could stare at me without blinking for 15 minutes at a time and I would notice you didn't blink once and there was a speech. I did not talk as much as other people. There was something going on with the manual, but I did not have a word for it

Speaker 5:          04:08          and so I'm pushed several times to get speech therapy, but every time he did, dad would just say, are you kidding? He may have troubled stumbling and stammering, but he'll grow out of it. I started to Blair. You also started Einstein. He didn't speak a word til he was six. He was considered retarded in school. He would say that this was some temporary problem that would pass. I didn't see anything that was, that was screaming out for attention. He was doing his work. He was interested in the Knicks. We would go out endlessly in cold weather to the park and it seemed like things were okay. What about Emmanuel?

Speaker 2:          04:47          Well, I knew that I was a nicer person, a nicer person. Yay. And then I was sent [inaudible] I don't automatically look at people in the eyes, the face and stuff, you know.

Speaker 7:          05:08          So as long as Emmanuel was a little kid, this wasn't such a big deal. But then he got older,

Speaker 6:          05:14          he was around 10 years old and it was that thing at the point where I'm on. The people would point it out. What did they say? Well, I have been called, um, returning and idiot savant, the n word and stuff.

Speaker 5:          05:31          They lost the innocence of the elementary school. Emmanuel would come home with bruises on his arms. Yeah. Yeah. It was something that I constantly thought about and worried about.

Speaker 6:          05:41          I said, yeah, well it'd be really good for him to get professional help with that.

Speaker 7:          05:45          Did you ask dad? He said the problem wasn't a manual. No, it was all the other people, the bullies, the group

Speaker 5:          05:52          in this neighborhood. It was hard. There was constant

Speaker 3:          05:58          fighting right down the street over here. People involved with crack. These are big guys, you know, I felt that it could have been a dangerous situation. So his solution, I decided that I wanted to teach you manual homeschool.

Speaker 5:          06:14          Pull his son out of school. Yeah. And how do you feel about this at the time? Well, I, I really didn't know.

Speaker 3:          06:22          Oh, up here. So we're looking in the closet here. I thought that whatever way he's kind of turned in. This is a binder from one of his classes that if he got bullied and tormented and going to school, that it would turn him further in. Let's see what this is. But that if he were here, he could develop along his own line til he became old enough that they wouldn't want to pick on him. Oh, look what we turned to nature. Nurture. It was a big deal for dad. You uh, hadn't

Speaker 5:          06:51          homeschooled anybody else before, right? No. I had to get books. I had to go meet the principal. He left his job, submitted a curriculum to the school and I had to register with the state of New York, created this syllabus for his son, great in integrated math course a lot. And they would wake up each morning rational numbers, geometry, do their lessons. Leslie's trying to leak lateral, trying to have some lunch. This is the work that he did at home and in the afternoon they'd go bowling. Bowling

Speaker 3:          07:22          manual wasn't

Speaker 8:          07:23          awesome.

Speaker 3:          07:25          His Dad would videotape him.

Speaker 8:          07:27          Today is Tuesday, December 28 1993.

Speaker 3:          07:35          It's weird footage. It's weird to watch because the manual is such an incredibly good, yeah.

Speaker 8:          07:42          Yeah. You took it out but beautiful shot. He's always by himself.

Speaker 3:          07:48          Tape after tape of nothing but a manual. Nobody else in the picture

Speaker 6:          07:54          I would fan to size about going on a tour and winning some tiles and stuff.

Speaker 3:          08:03          Did you think about joining any youth league?

Speaker 6:          08:07          Well, kind of. Well, I vaguely don't about it, but um, but for some reason my dad didn't want me to

Speaker 8:          08:28          [inaudible].

Speaker 5:          08:28          Meanwhile his brother is just players in Canada at a distance. Yeah. He followed a girl there and one day he picks a book off the shelf DSM and the DSM is the a diagdiagnosis statistical manual mental disorders. Okay. Then I started just to do, I guess what a lot of people would do who could get ahold of this thing is to start diagnosing all of their friends like diagnosed my girlfriend, I diagnosed my dad and

Speaker 2:          08:56          then I saw her right there in the page.

Speaker 9:          09:00          Marc's impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors such as eye to eye gaze, repetitive behavior patterns, problem seeking, new friends, problem, being able to understand what someone must be thinking. Problems have went down this whole list and everything seemed to fit Martin Pyramids and I, I gave this promise every time he tried to call his dad. What do you think his dad would say? Just stop whining. He'll just go through this and he shot him out. You basically cut communication. I know my son,

Speaker 2:          09:32          he would always tell me Dan, whenever I hand would go, we're way when I was in adult. What does an adult mean? Does that mean 18? Um, um, 20 meaning 20 lesson. Okay. So he thought as soon as I reached the age of 20 then I would have these problems. Yeah. So did you wake up on your 20th birthday and think, I thought they made me, things would change right away, but they didn't. After that, a manual says he got really depressed and that's how things might've stayed until

Speaker 8:          10:17          [inaudible] heart attack.

Speaker 5:          10:21          Blair comes to the hospital, finds dad unconscious on the bed, and he realizes this is my big chance because he was not in a position to intervene. And you're thinking, I'm thinking the first thing that's gonna happen is that we're going to get a diagnosis because we're waiting for it for so many years, 26 or older or whatever it goes, like 25 maybe he's going to get help.

Speaker 2:          10:40          You know? He's, he has to get out mean here's the, okay, 2005 so where are we coming into now? We're at 42nd Street Times Square

Speaker 10:         10:50          Time Square is one of Emanuel's favorite areas to hang out. And I figured I wanted to be on his surf so they're outside. The crowd is just beginning to arrive. It was starting to snow a little bit and rain some too. Yeah, I think Blair turns to management and he says, oh, have you ever heard of [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          11:12          autism? I said, I highly suspect that you have some form of autism and I want us to find some way for you to get it diagnosed. Yes.

Speaker 8:          11:31          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          11:32          oh, and I said six, don't be the word it is today.

Speaker 8:          11:44          [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          11:44          Dr, how do I pronounce your name? FDIC. Yeah. Agnostic. And pretty soon after New Year's. And where are you from? I'm awake. Manual gets his diagnosis. He goes right on this couch. I did get the feeling from my beginning of the interaction that he was going to meet criteria for autism. And a month later she told me that I was on the autistic spectrum. It was official.

Speaker 11:         12:09          Um, okay. Football. Uh, wait.

Speaker 2:          12:14          And so at the age of 26, finally [inaudible] his life completely changed. So I gave him a tape recorder to record his life. Hello with me venue. He's meeting with his speech pathologist a couple of hours a week also. He's joined this program [inaudible] and started making friends. Oh, do I say hello? Hey Jason. Peace out. Got a girlfriend. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          12:43          Hey, it's me, Emmanuel. One second again. And there's one lady that I haven't talked about your name, Norma. And we went to central park and we took pitches and it was great.

Speaker 2:          12:58          But I always say, I thought that people who are diagnosed with autism don't this, the definition is they don't want to socialize. Well ms not because I know do want to, but [inaudible] this is hard to do. He know. But here's the thing about a manual. He's had this whole new life. He hasn't told dad about any of it. Hello Haney thing, not the girl, the friends, the diagnosis. His Dad doesn't know anything's different. So how long have you been keeping it a secret? It's been since 2005. Right? Yeah. So basically for the last two years, a manual has been leading this double life outside. He's a person with autism, then he comes home. Nothing's wrong. Why? Well, I'm just afraid in the anyone, um, really, um, believe in, but he knows he's gotta tell his dad who he really is and he keeps saying he will

Speaker 6:          13:57          lemme say within a month soon. I'm not quite sure we can, I am a little bit nervous about telling him about my ass spot. Maybe within a few minutes or so. Let me tell him in like two weeks or so. [inaudible] I mind to tell him Matha I mean Blair [inaudible] well tomorrow maybe one or no yet. I'm just thinking about it a little bit too much. I don't know. And then finally one night, I just want to say that I told him [inaudible] I said I really have something important to say and don't get angry. And then I told him that I was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome and he asked me what it was and then I told him is high functioning

Speaker 2:          14:52          autism?

Speaker 3:          14:53          Uh, I was shocked that w that would be a good way to put it. So do you think he has Asperger's? Yes. Yes I do. When I look at this syndrome for a lot good parts of it, it's e manual, but I never at any point felt that that he manual was in need of any deep psychological or psych psychiatric help.

Speaker 8:          15:25          But

Speaker 3:          15:27          I mean, what makes you qualified to say that? Just being a loving parent as I'm talking to him, we're sitting there on the couches in front of us on the coffee table is all of the manuals, notebooks from age five onward and they're really good stuff. I mean it's stuff that you and I would write and he saved it all. But the question that I feel like I got to ask her and I just have one more question on my list if I can ask you that one is, um, now that you know that there is something wrong with your son, that there always was this disorder, that it's incurable. Do you think you did the right thing? So d,

Speaker 2:          16:03          do you wish that he had gotten the diagnosis earlier? No, because I think that he's better off at this point in time. Why wouldn't it make a difference to know earlier? What's why you're acting so strangely. I didn't want he manual to get a diagnosis that would put him in a box, like a label. And then dad says to me, remember, look, I mean if I had let the school give him some kind of diagnosis, they would've thrown him in special ed and say, oh, he's a retard. Look. He can't even talk. I mean, that would've destroyed them. They would cause irreparable damage. I asked the doctor was there any truth to them? If a manual was put into special Ed, hypothetically, he wasn't a district seven to five class. The technical word for special ed would not have raised his academic potential. He, he said graduate from St John's with a degree in psychology.

Speaker 2:          16:58          Kids who graduate district 75 don't do that. Just to put that in perspective, Emmanuel comes from a neighborhood where about 10% of the kids ever graduate college. And my GPA was like 3.4 and change. Wow. And he's got Asperger's. So now we're kind of in the opposite. We're kind of vindicating really what his father did. Right. Weight in terms of his academic achievement. His father did the right thing. The problem with his dad's choice, and he had no way of knowing at the time was the lack of peer groups, what team he stamped on. It seems like a cruel choice, but [inaudible] choice. So if you were your father and you were raising your kid at that time, would you have made the same choice? He did? Um, well couldn't. Well, if I had known what I

Speaker 6:          17:50          known now, then maybe I would have maybe back Tim a little more for me. You get to interact with others who were like, I am cool. Or like I am

Speaker 4:          18:18          [inaudible] [inaudible]
