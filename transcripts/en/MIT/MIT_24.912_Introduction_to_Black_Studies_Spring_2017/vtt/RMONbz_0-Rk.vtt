MICHEL DEGRAFF: Yes, I do
think that the Black Matters

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.430
course has taken new urgency
in this current climate.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.210
If we think, for example, of
the most recent elections,

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.890
the campaigns that we all
heard on TV, on the radio,

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.880
in the newspapers, it's
clear that identity politics

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.510
played a key role.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.280
So if you think of the various
claims about immigrants,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.860
about Muslims, about race,
about blacks, identity politics,

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.490
I think, was a major
focus of the campaign.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.004
And I think the students
themselves, when I look at--

00:00:43.004 --> 00:00:45.420
when we started, I gave out
the questionnaires asking them

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.510
why they took the course, what
drove them to Black Matters.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.475
And many of them actually
assume that the course

00:00:51.475 --> 00:00:53.850
is called Black Matters because
of the Black Lives Matter

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:54.620
movement.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.120
But in fact, that course
started 10 years ago,

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.550
before there was a Black
Lives Matter movement.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.620
But within themselves,
they came to the course

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.950
wanting to address current
political issues, including

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:11.430
issues of race, of identity, of
migration, of religious hatred.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.501
So definitely, there was a sense
of urgency coming especially

00:01:15.501 --> 00:01:17.250
from the students'
perspective themselves.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.960
They wanted to
discuss these issues

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.020
and get a better understanding
of how to process,

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.930
but also how to counter
some of these claims

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.610
about identity, race,
religion, migration, etc.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.850
So as I was thinking about
the syllabus and the course

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.610
description, I couldn't
help but thinking

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.670
about the slogan of building
walls to protect, say, the US.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.820
And as I was picking texts
and choosing guest speakers,

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.699
I realized that it was important
to create a new narrative

00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:50.490
around this issue of
walls, because I think

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.180
that our humanity is in reach
when we can build bridges

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.170
instead of brick walls.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.250
So for me, the course-- and also
for some of my guest speakers--

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.740
it was important to
create a new narrative

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.250
around the concept of
building bridges that indeed

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.070
will make this world
great, not just the US,

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.010
but the world great.
