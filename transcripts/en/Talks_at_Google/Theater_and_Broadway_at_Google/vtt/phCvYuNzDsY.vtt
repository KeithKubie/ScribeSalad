JULIE JAMES: Hey, everybody,
it's great to be here with you.

00:00:05.824 --> 00:00:08.830
As you've already
heard, I am Julie James.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.880
I host Broadway Names with
Julie James, no relation,

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.090
on Sirius XM radio featuring
show tunes and celebrity

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.320
and news and all those great
things about Broadway coast

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.830
to coast 24/7.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.710
I'm delighted to be taking
the next hour, or maybe two,

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.090
if George speaks in his
signature slow rate,

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.140
to introduce you to
a piece of theater

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.820
that I've been obsessed
with since its world

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.540
premiere at the Old Globe
Theater in San Diego.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.620
A show whose imminent
Broadway arrival

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.390
I've been anticipating since
I first heard the music,

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.010
and we're going to
hear a full five songs

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.580
showcased here today with
very special guests, including

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.250
the world premiere of one of
the new numbers from the show.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.630
"Allegiance" is a
new American musical

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.970
based on true events, which
means, of course, that I can't

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.240
go any further without
introducing our guest of honor.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.870
He's a sci-fi icon, a tireless
advocate for human rights,

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:22.880
and the star of "Allegiance,"
a man who really needs

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.720
no introduction
because you're already

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.510
friends with him on Facebook.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.654
That's right, here he is, the
one and only George Takei.

00:01:31.654 --> 00:01:35.112
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.360
Welcome, welcome, George.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.025
GEORGE TAKEI: Thank
you very much.

00:01:46.025 --> 00:01:47.650
JULIE JAMES: This is
going to be great.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.630
So let's dive right in.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.610
One thing that people may
not know about "Allegiance"

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.880
is that it's inspired by your
very childhood and your years

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.320
while imprisoned during the
Japanese American internment,

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.610
and that you yourself
were an internee.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.430
GEORGE TAKEI: Yes,
that is correct.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.979
JULIE JAMES: It's unbelievable.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.750
So tell us a little
bit more about that.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.520
GEORGE TAKEI: Well, Japan bombed
Pearl Harbor, as you know,

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.600
on December 7, 1941 and that
plunged the whole world it

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.440
into another world war.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.850
For Japanese Americans, American
citizens of Japanese ancestry,

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.890
it was a catastrophic
experience.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.270
Because overnight,
we were looked

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:46.630
at with suspicion and fear
and outright hatred simply

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.060
because we happened to
look like the people that

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.820
bombed Pearl Harbor.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:57.900
And the hysteria grew and grew
until on February 19, 1942,

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.550
the President of
the United States,

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.540
Franklin Delano Roosevelt,
ordered all Japanese Americans

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.930
on the West Coast,
approximately 120,000

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.110
of us, to be summarily
rounded up, with no charges,

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.420
with no trial, with no due
process, the central pillar

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.430
of our justice
system, and ordered

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.890
them to be incarcerated in
10 barbed wire prison camps,

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.110
in some of the most god
awful places in this country.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.080
The blistering hot
desert of Arizona,

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.320
the sultry swamps of Arkansas,
southeastern Arkansas,

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.380
the cold windswept high plains
of Wyoming, Idaho, Utah,

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.840
Colorado, and two of the most
desolate places in California.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.890
On April 20, I celebrated my
fifth birthday and my parents

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.290
tell me that they gave
me a birthday party,

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.910
but I don't remember that.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:03.300
Because a few weeks after that
my parents got me, my brother,

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:10.380
a year younger, and my baby
sister, not yet a year old,

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.860
they got us up very early,
and they hurriedly dressed us.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.630
And my brother and I were in
the living room looking out

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.790
the front window, and we
saw two soldiers marching up

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.350
our driveway.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.290
They carried rifles
with bayonets

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.000
shining on top of them.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.540
They stomped up the front porch
and banged on the front door.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.860
My father answered it and
literally at gunpoint,

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.810
we were ordered out of our home.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.910
My father gave my brother and
me little pieces of luggage

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.050
to carry, and we went
out on the driveway

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.160
and waited for our
mother to come out.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.670
She took some time.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.810
And when she finally
emerged she had our baby

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.160
sister in one arm
and a huge duffel bag

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:09.230
in the other and tears were
streaming down both her cheeks.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.200
I may have been five years
old, but I will never

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.750
forget that terrifying morning.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.860
We were taken from our
home on a truck where

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.370
there were other Japanese
American families gathered

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.560
to Santa Anita racetrack,
a nearby racetrack,

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.160
and driven to the stable
area where we were unloaded.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.170
And we were herded over
to the stable area.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:42.130
And we were told by the soldiers
that this one horse stall would

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.020
be where we would
stay temporarily

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.840
while the camps are being built.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.250
All five of us, three
children and our parents,

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:57.740
moved from a two bedroom home
on Garnet Street in Los Angeles

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.450
to this smelly horse stall.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:06.710
For my parents, it was a
degrading, humiliating, painful

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.460
experience, but for
five-year-old me

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.390
I thought it was
kind of fun that we

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:15.510
get to sleep where
the horseys sleep.

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:19.280
If you breathe deeply,
you can smell them.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.520
So we were there
for a few months

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.360
and then the construction
of the camps was completed,

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.960
and we were put on trains
with armed soldiers

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:36.030
at both ends of each car,
as if we were criminals.

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:40.060
And we were transported 2/3
of the way across the country

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.130
to the swamps of
southeastern Arkansas.

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:48.790
I still remember the barbed
wire fences that confined me.

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:53.760
The tall sentry towers with
the machine guns pointed at us.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.850
I remember the searchlight
that followed me

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:59.810
when I made the night
runs to the latrine.

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:04.260
But young children are
amazingly adaptable.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:08.520
What would be grotesquely
abnormal in normal times

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:13.630
became my normality behind
those barbed wire fences.

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:16.070
It became normal for me
to the line up three times

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:20.720
a day to eat lousy food
in a noisy mess hall.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.740
It became routine for me
to go to a mass shower

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.980
with my father.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:29.530
And it became normal for me
to go to school in a black tar

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:31.930
paper barrack and
begin the school

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:36.180
day with the Pledge of
Allegiance to the flag.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.090
I could see the barbed wire
fence and the sentry tower

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:41.870
right outside my
schoolhouse window

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:49.210
as I recited the words with
liberty and justice for all.

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:50.520
JULIE JAMES: Incredible.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.130
It's such an incredible
thing that you're

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:56.120
going to be telling
this true life

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:00.120
story, a mostly unknown
story of America,

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.150
and events that
you lived through,

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:04.300
but that you're going
to be reenacting

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.190
these events on
a Broadway stage.

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:09.140
What does that mean to you?

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.450
GEORGE TAKEI: It's a very
meaningful experience for me,

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:16.310
very exciting for me,
but it is profoundly

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:19.740
meaningful to Japanese
American families

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:23.830
and to the Japanese
American community.

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:33.900
And like all musicals there is
the story of forbidden love.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:41.320
And it's an epic story of
the World War II battles.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:47.430
We tell the story of a heroic,
most decorated military unit

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:50.370
in the entire Second
World War, which

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:54.850
happened to be made up of
all Japanese Americans,

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:57.320
the 442nd Regimental
Combat Team.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:06.200
But most of all, it's
a story of two people.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:13.860
A brother, I play Sammy,
and Sammy's sister,

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:21.880
played by Lea Salonga, and it's
their story, their adventures.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:26.460
It's a story that
you've never heard,

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:30.902
but a family that you
will never forget.

00:09:30.902 --> 00:09:31.860
JULIE JAMES: Beautiful.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:33.410
Beautifully said.

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:39.810
So you know words
are powerful, and we

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:44.450
have a lot of great
plays on Broadway.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:46.690
Why did you think
that a musical would

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:49.410
be the best way
to tell the story

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:53.170
of "Allegiance"
and your history?

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:58.720
GEORGE TAKEI: Words have the
power of reaching the brain,

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.630
set us thinking.

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:05.150
Music reaches the
heart, our feelings,

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:08.200
and when you combine the
two together in a musical

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.580
it becomes a singular force.

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:15.300
It is a beautiful
story that we tell,

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:22.590
and that story is still too
little known in this country.

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:26.360
And so I've spent most of my
adult life talking about it

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:33.540
to universities, to
governmental agencies,

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:35.870
and to corporate groups.

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:38.870
And we've developed
a musical about it,

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:42.570
and this is what's
so exciting to me.

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:47.760
And I consider this
musical my legacy project,

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:53.450
and my husband, Brad,
shares with me this passion

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:56.330
to get our legacy
project on Broadway.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:57.720
JULIE JAMES: Oh,
that's so sweet.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.090
Is Brad here?

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:00.560
Hi, Brad.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.545
Everybody, Brad Takei.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:10.530
It's so great to see
you here and the fact

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:15.210
that he's by your side
and believing in you 100%

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:18.270
and helping shepherd
this is fantastic.

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:20.910
It's so great to see you, Brad.

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:24.130
So now, in the show
"Allegiance," you play,

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:27.020
not one, but two
characters, right?

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.680
GEORGE TAKEI: That's correct.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:32.440
In the San Diego production
at the Old Globe,

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:37.650
I had the pleasure of the
sharing the role of Sam Kimura

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:41.727
with a very talented
young man, Telly Leung.

00:11:41.727 --> 00:11:42.810
JULIE JAMES: I love Telly.

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:45.740
GEORGE TAKEI: Oh, yeah,
he's a fantastic performer.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:51.610
And Telly plays
Sam as a young man

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:53.510
during the period
of the internment.

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:59.720
And I play Sam in the
present, many years later.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:06.470
But I also play Sam's
grandfather, an immigrant man

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:11.320
who came to this country
with hope and ambition.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:15.640
And he's something of a rascal.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.640
JULIE JAMES: Typcasting?

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:22.700
Typecasting, I hear?

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:26.550
Telly is, of course, a
veteran of the Broadway stage.

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:30.060
You might have seen him
in "Wicked," or "Rent,"

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.110
or "Godspell."

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:35.250
Many fans will recognize
him from "Glee,"

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:39.920
and unfortunately, Telly, like
some of our other original cast

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.610
members, was not able
to be here today,

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:47.020
but we are lucky enough to
have some behind the scenes

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:49.450
footage of Telly
recording an upcoming

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:52.120
single from the score
of "Allegiance,"

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:55.931
and it's called
"What Makes a Man."

00:12:55.931 --> 00:12:58.913
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:58.913 --> 00:13:02.392
[MUSIC - "WHAT MAKES A MAN"]

00:16:11.162 --> 00:16:13.154
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:16:13.154 --> 00:16:16.142
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:18.072 --> 00:16:19.780
JULIE JAMES: I got
the chills everywhere.

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:21.690
Oh my gosh.

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:23.420
That was fantastic.

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:27.550
Telly Leung in that video.

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:30.130
You know, "Allegiance"
isn't actually though

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:32.414
the story of just one man.

00:16:32.414 --> 00:16:33.330
It's about a lot more.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:34.650
GEORGE TAKEI: No, it isn't.

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:38.890
It's about our family
and the community,

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:43.490
and ultimately,
it's about America,

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:48.440
because it was our Constitution
that was egregiously violated.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:53.450
But, primarily, the
story is about Sam Kimura

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:56.060
and his sister, Kay Kimura.

00:16:56.060 --> 00:17:01.680
And that sister is played by
the luminous Lea Salonga, a Tony

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:05.060
Award winner for her
starring role in "Miss

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:10.020
Saigon," and the voice
of Jasmine in "Alladin,"

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:16.109
and also the voice of Mulan
in the Disney animated film.

00:17:16.109 --> 00:17:19.510
And she is spectacular.

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:24.640
It's a story that
people have never heard,

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:27.140
but it's a family
you will not forget.

00:17:29.259 --> 00:17:31.550
JULIE JAMES: I think one of
the other things I'm really

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:37.490
struck by in the show is the
strength and determination

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:41.500
of the women in "Allegiance."

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:43.420
One of the songs
that comes to mind

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:47.340
is called "Stronger
Than Before,"

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:52.690
and it's a duet sung between
the two main female characters.

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:56.510
And, like a lot of women
during World War II,

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:59.140
the characters have
both been empowered

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:01.720
by the fight for
freedom and found

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.340
strength in two
surprising places,

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:07.360
the support of an
unexpected ally

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:10.500
and also from within themselves.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.320
Here to sing the world
premiere-- this is really

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:16.340
special everybody, of
"Stronger Than Before"

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:19.250
are two Broadway treasures.

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:23.370
We have "Wicked's" Lindsay
Mendez and "Godspell's"

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:26.960
Anna Maria Perez de Tagle
singing a special pop

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:30.360
arrangement by Lynn Shankle.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.648
Welcome, ladies.

00:18:31.648 --> 00:18:34.576
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:42.872 --> 00:18:46.288
[MUSIC - "STRONGER THAN BEFORE"]

00:22:37.525 --> 00:22:40.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:52.060
JULIE JAMES: Two of my
favorite Broadway voices.

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:53.080
They are fantastic.

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.820
GEORGE TAKEI: And if you know
the context of that song,

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:57.670
it is so moving.

00:22:57.670 --> 00:22:58.940
It comes near the end.

00:22:58.940 --> 00:22:59.690
JULIE JAMES: Yeah.

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:01.360
GEORGE TAKEI: And
it is powerful.

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:03.070
JULIE JAMES: Yeah.

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:07.910
Brings back some memories of
some Kristin and Idina for me.

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:11.780
So George, one of
the main, I guess,

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:15.190
central pieces of the
plot of "Allegiance"

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:19.130
focuses on the
loyalty questionnaire.

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:22.430
Can you tell us more about that?

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:24.150
GEORGE TAKEI: The
loyalty questionnaire

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:27.720
turned all 10
camps into turmoil.

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:30.790
This was a year
into imprisonment,

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:35.100
and the government realized
that there is a wartime manpower

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:37.940
shortage and here are
all these young people

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:42.390
that we labeled
enemy non-aliens.

00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:43.840
Non-aliens.

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:45.260
What does that mean?

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:48.250
That's a citizen
defined in the negative.

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:51.060
They even took the word
citizen away from us

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:53.800
and put us in
these prison camps.

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:55.820
How do we tap them?

00:23:55.820 --> 00:24:01.210
Their solution was a
outrageous solution, a loyalty

00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:04.350
questionnaire, which was
a series of questions.

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:08.590
But there are two key questions
that everyone in the camp

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:10.190
had to respond to.

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:19.310
Everyone over 17 years of age,
from 17 to 87, man or woman,

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:23.540
American born or an immigrant.

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:27.110
Question 27, one of the two
controversial questions,

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:30.040
asked will you
bear arms to defend

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.760
the United States of America?

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.960
This being asked of a
17-year-old young man

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:39.450
or an 87-year-old
immigrant lady.

00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:41.620
It was preposterous.

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:45.160
Question 28 was one
sentence, and it

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:50.910
was a very insidious sentence
with two opposite ideas.

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:54.360
It asked will you swear
your loyalty to the United

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:59.180
States of America and
forswear your loyalty

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:01.780
to the emperor of Japan?

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:03.690
We're Americans.

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:08.190
For the government to assume
that we're born with a loyalty

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:11.390
to the emperor, that
there's something genetic

00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:15.190
about a loyalty to the
emperor, was outrageous.

00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:18.620
You can't forswear something
that you don't have.

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:25.310
So my father said, they took my
business, they took our home,

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:27.570
they took our
freedom, the one thing

00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:30.220
I'm not going to give
them is my dignity.

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:32.920
I am not going to grovel
before this government.

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:37.870
He answered no, and for that
he was labeled disloyal.

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:42.030
There was another group
of young men who said,

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:45.290
I will fight for my country
because I'm an American,

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:49.220
but I will fight as an American.

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:54.150
If I can report to my hometown
draft board with my family

00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:57.310
back home, I will
fight for this country,

00:25:57.310 --> 00:26:01.440
but I will not go
as an internee going

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:04.610
from behind these barbed wire
fences, leaving my family

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:06.430
and loved ones behind.

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:10.680
And for that courageous,
principled stand

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:15.570
they were tried for draft
evasion, found guilty,

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:19.420
and thrown into
federal penitentiaries.

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:23.280
But there's another
amazing group of people.

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:28.910
These young men bit the
bullet, and women too, they

00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:32.560
bit the bullet,
swallowed their pride

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:37.640
and answered both questions as
the government wanted them to,

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:41.320
and they went from behind
these barbed wire fences,

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:44.470
putting on the same uniform
as that of the sentries that

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:47.480
guarded over us,
leaving their family

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:53.290
and loved ones in imprisonment
to fight for this country.

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:56.870
And their story is
an amazing story.

00:26:56.870 --> 00:27:02.930
They fought with incredible
courage and valor.

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:05.370
They sustained the
highest combat casualty

00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:10.020
rate of any unit of
it's comparable size,

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:14.760
and they came back the
single most decorated unit

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.490
of the entire war.

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:19.540
They were welcomed back
to the United States

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:22.600
on the White House lawn
by President Truman, who

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:28.010
said to them, you fought not
only the enemy, but prejudice,

00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:28.920
and you won.

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:33.470
JULIE JAMES: That's incredible.

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:36.150
You know, I think one of the
things that really strikes me

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:41.240
about this story, your
story, is that throughout all

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:44.030
of this, at the
same time, you're

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:47.470
keeping up some
sense of normalcy.

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:49.580
It's just absolutely incredible.

00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:51.240
Tell us a little bit about that.

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:52.560
GEORGE TAKEI: Well, it's
my parents actually.

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:52.870
JULIE JAMES: Yeah?

00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:54.745
GEORGE TAKEI: And all
the adults that did it.

00:27:54.745 --> 00:27:59.350
Yes, we tried to have normalcy
while living in those black tar

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:01.010
paper barracks.

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:04.260
My mother's scavenged
around and got

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:08.870
the military to give her
some scrap military fabric,

00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:13.440
and she made curtains
for our barrack windows

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:16.140
so that we'd have some privacy.

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:18.140
There are some who
had green thumbs,

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:20.660
and they took that
barren landscape

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:25.280
and turned it into bountiful,
productive victory gardens,

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.020
if you will.

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:31.060
And there are others who
were handy with crafts,

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:33.450
and they worked on crafts.

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:36.090
My father loved
baseball and he was

00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:39.940
a member of our
block baseball team.

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:46.430
And I remember going to
sleep at the end of the day,

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:49.970
my mother put us to bed
early because we were kids,

00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:56.500
hearing the songs of the
1940s, because the camp command

00:28:56.500 --> 00:29:01.290
occasionally, about every other
month, allowed the young people

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:05.410
to have dances in the
mess hall after dinner.

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:08.270
They cleared the tables
and the benches away

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:11.370
and played their
dance songs, or they

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:13.560
may have performed themselves.

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:17.000
And I went to bed
listening to the big band

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.800
sound of Tommy Dorsey, or The
Andrews Sisters, the swing

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.320
sound, or the bebop sounds.

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:27.090
And so that's one
of the fond memories

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:33.060
of my childhood
in a prison camp.

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.180
JULIE JAMES: Yeah.

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:36.090
That's astounding.

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:38.600
We're going to use some
of that as inspiration

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:41.560
for the next song that
we're going to hear,

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:45.860
is kind of just such a
sort of a dance tune.

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:48.860
The song "Paradise,"
I understand,

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:52.640
parodies both the
injustice of the internment

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:55.400
and the propaganda
surrounding it.

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:58.850
But it's a toe-tapping
number, kind

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:01.620
of the likes of which you
can only see on Broadway.

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:05.470
So here to perform "Paradise,"
from the cast of "If/Then,"

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:07.950
is Mark de la Cruz.

00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:08.450
Welcome.

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:10.940
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:18.908 --> 00:30:22.394
[MUSIC - "PARADISE"]

00:32:42.058 --> 00:32:44.538
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:53.466 --> 00:32:55.490
JULIE JAMES: Thank
you, Mark and the cast.

00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:57.060
Oh, I love that.

00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:58.104
That is so Broadway.

00:32:58.104 --> 00:32:59.520
GEORGE TAKEI: Isn't
that terrific?

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:00.440
JULIE JAMES: Love it.

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:04.520
So George, anyone who hears
you speak, or knows you

00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:06.580
from online, knows
your body of work,

00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:11.230
knows that you always
just shoot for the stars.

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:17.120
You have so much optimism
and faith in humankind.

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:22.310
You've been a catalyst for
social justice and innovation.

00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:23.480
I mean, you're unbelievable.

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:28.250
You always ask us to
be our highest selves

00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:31.600
and to better ourselves,
even if it's grammar online.

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:33.156
Thank you for that.

00:33:33.156 --> 00:33:34.364
GEORGE TAKEI: Keep it coming.

00:33:34.364 --> 00:33:35.312
Keep it coming.

00:33:35.312 --> 00:33:37.590
I love it.

00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:41.220
JULIE JAMES: So, I guess, what
I really want you to speak to is

00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:43.370
how is it possible that
a man like you, who

00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:47.240
spent your childhood as
a political prisoner,

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:50.860
can have all of this
unending optimism

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:54.780
and resounding
faith in humankind?

00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:58.070
GEORGE TAKEI: Well, I think I'm
basically an optimistic guy.

00:33:58.070 --> 00:34:01.870
I had parents that
were optimists.

00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:06.540
I think it's optimism
that gets things done.

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:08.600
You know, we can do it.

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:12.219
I can do a marathon, 26.2 miles.

00:34:12.219 --> 00:34:15.600
People say that's impossible,
but you say to yourself,

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:16.540
I will do it.

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:19.150
And even when your
muscles complain.

00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:23.219
You say, muscle, you will do
it, and you wind up doing it.

00:34:23.219 --> 00:34:29.570
And that attitude is in
my grandfather character,

00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:30.620
Ojii-San.

00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:33.730
He has a wonderful
line that I love.

00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:36.710
He says-- and he's an
immigrant from Japan,

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:43.199
you see, flower bloom
where it is planted.

00:34:43.199 --> 00:34:46.969
So even in those
harsh circumstances,

00:34:46.969 --> 00:34:52.780
desolate high plains, or
the swamps, or the deserts,

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:56.562
you try to be the
best of yourself.

00:34:56.562 --> 00:34:58.710
JULIE JAMES: That's
so inspiring.

00:34:58.710 --> 00:35:01.630
I think that
determination is really

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:04.000
at the heart of
"Allegiance," and it's also

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.830
at the heart of the next song
that we're going to present.

00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:10.260
You probably will
recognize our next guest

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:13.910
from a little tiny show
called "American Idol,"

00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:17.860
and she is going to
be singing "Higher."

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:22.106
Here is the fantastic
Melinda Doolittle.

00:35:22.106 --> 00:35:24.571
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:40.347 --> 00:35:43.798
[MUSIC - "HIGHER"]

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:19.666
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:25.122 --> 00:39:30.070
JULIE JAMES: Melinda Doolittle,
another of our special guests

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:30.765
here today.

00:39:30.765 --> 00:39:31.740
GEORGE TAKEI: She
is sensational.

00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:32.781
JULIE JAMES: Sensational.

00:39:32.781 --> 00:39:35.650
GEORGE TAKEI: And the
song, in context, you

00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:37.760
won't believe how moving it is.

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:39.770
JULIE JAMES: Wow, wow.

00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:43.660
So I know many of
your fans are dying

00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:46.730
to know, George, including
me, when is "Allegiance"

00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:48.260
coming to Broadway?

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:50.300
GEORGE TAKEI: Ah, yes.

00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:52.360
Well, as you know,
there are many,

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:56.450
many plays lined up
waiting to get a vacancy

00:39:56.450 --> 00:40:00.189
and every theater on
Broadway is occupied.

00:40:00.189 --> 00:40:01.480
JULIE JAMES: Spoken for, right.

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:02.810
GEORGE TAKEI: Yes.

00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:05.050
Well, I'm a farmer's grandson.

00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:08.930
My grandfather was a farmer
in the Sacramento Delta

00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:13.230
and when a farmer feels
something in his bones,

00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:14.900
that's pretty reliable.

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:22.230
And I feel in my bones that we
will be on Broadway in 2015.

00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:24.380
2015.

00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:30.880
So those of you who have already
bought your Priority Access

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:34.990
pass, or are on our
email list, or follow me

00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:37.180
on Facebook, gaman.

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:41.867
That's a word you
know now, gaman.

00:40:41.867 --> 00:40:43.950
JULIE JAMES: Yes, yes,
you've introduced it to us.

00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:47.820
GEORGE TAKEI: We will be
on Broadway very soon.

00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:48.840
JULIE JAMES: Excellent.

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:51.530
I'm so glad to hear that.

00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:53.760
I'm going to go back
to gaman in a moment,

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:56.140
but also, I know
that you actually

00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:59.990
have a very special surprise
in store for everybody today.

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:01.550
GEORGE TAKEI: Ah, yes.

00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:05.880
We've made the
"Allegiance" mini album

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:09.720
completely free to
download on Google Play.

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:10.910
JULIE JAMES: Woo.

00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:14.690
GEORGE TAKEI: You
can get it all free.

00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:18.390
It features six songs
from "Allegiance,"

00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:22.010
and this is our way
of saying thank you

00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:26.660
to you for the support
you've given us on our trek

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:27.560
to Broadway.

00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:28.650
JULIE JAMES: Trek.

00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:29.750
Oh my.

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:31.223
GEORGE TAKEI: Oh my.

00:41:31.223 --> 00:41:34.331
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:34.331 --> 00:41:35.580
JULIE JAMES: That's fantastic.

00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:37.790
I love all of the cool ideas
that you guys have come up

00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:39.581
with like the priority
access and all that.

00:41:39.581 --> 00:41:40.520
It's just fantastic.

00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:42.750
So going back to
gaman, For anybody

00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:48.320
who doesn't know, since you've
introduced me to that word,

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:51.430
but for anybody who's watching,
or here in our audience that

00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:54.780
doesn't know, can you tell
us exactly what that means?

00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:59.870
GEORGE TAKEI: Yes, gaman
means to endure with dignity,

00:41:59.870 --> 00:42:05.050
to overcome whatever
challenges you

00:42:05.050 --> 00:42:09.640
are facing, by
confidence and fortitude.

00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:13.040
And it's a word that, you
know, I heard from my mother

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:15.260
often in camp.

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:19.830
I remember, particularly when we
we're lined up at the latrine,

00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:27.100
and there I was, you know,
wiggling and doing a jig

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:30.580
to try to contain
myself, and my mother

00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:35.530
would say, gaman, George, gaman.

00:42:35.530 --> 00:42:40.170
And I gritted my teeth,
and I'm proud to tell you

00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:43.486
I always made it to the
latrine with dignity.

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:50.160
But it's that word gaman
that made it possible

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:57.760
for us to make it through
that horrible period

00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:00.570
behind those barbed
wire fences, gaman.

00:43:00.570 --> 00:43:05.780
It's what kept it possible
for us to love each other

00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:10.479
and to love this country
that we were born in.

00:43:10.479 --> 00:43:12.020
JULIE JAMES: A story
of perseverance.

00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:13.630
It's perfect.

00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:16.580
Gaman is a wonderful
note for us to end

00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:19.920
our little special
showcase here today.

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:24.300
So here to perform "Gaman"
from the score of "Allegiance"

00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:27.800
is a spectacular group
of Broadway performers.

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:30.624
Come on and welcome
them to the stage.

00:43:30.624 --> 00:43:34.068
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:45.876 --> 00:43:49.320
[MUSIC - "GAMAN"]

00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:03.990
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:20.240
JULIE JAMES: So this
is really exciting.

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:24.045
We're going to actually spend
a couple of minutes doing Q&amp;A,

00:47:24.045 --> 00:47:27.790
and I want to invite
anyone who has a question.

00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:30.890
We're going to be inviting the
creative team of "Allegiance"

00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:35.190
to join us on stage with George,
and if you have a question,

00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:39.280
we have microphones on the right
and left side of the house.

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:41.010
And so we would
just ask you to step

00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:43.330
right up if you have a
question, and then we also

00:47:43.330 --> 00:47:49.920
have George's legion of
internet fans, I know,

00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:53.750
have been furiously submitting
their questions as well.

00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:55.700
So we're going to try
to take some of those.

00:47:55.700 --> 00:48:00.600
So let me just have a quick
intro from our creative team

00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:04.100
so you know who you are
being joined by here today.

00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:06.000
It's great to see you guys.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.744
What a great presentation.

00:48:07.744 --> 00:48:09.160
LORENZO THIONE:
I'm Lorenzo Thione

00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:12.492
and I'm the co-book writer
and producer of "Allegiance."

00:48:12.492 --> 00:48:13.540
JAY KUO: Jay Kuo.

00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:15.980
I'm the composer and
lyricist of the show.

00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:18.565
MARC ACITO: I'm Marc Acito,
I'm the co-book writer.

00:48:18.565 --> 00:48:19.940
LYNNE SHANKEL:
I'm Lynne Shankel,

00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:23.120
I'm the music supervisor,
arranger, orchestrator.

00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:26.140
STAFFORD ARIMA: Stafford
Arima, the director.

00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:29.900
-Gosh, what a great,
great showcase today that

00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:32.830
you gave us, just a brief
taste of "Allegiance."

00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:34.130
It's just fantastic.

00:48:34.130 --> 00:48:35.380
MARC ACITO: We won't disagree.

00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:39.810
JULIE JAMES: So I would
love to dig right in.

00:48:39.810 --> 00:48:42.010
Do we have anyone
that has a question?

00:48:42.010 --> 00:48:43.420
I think you do.

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:45.220
I see someone here
in the audience.

00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:49.142
AUDIENCE: I was just curious,
when are tickets going on sale?

00:48:49.142 --> 00:48:49.850
JULIE JAMES: Woo.

00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:51.266
LORENZO THIONE:
I'll take that one

00:48:51.266 --> 00:48:53.060
JULIE JAMES: We like that one.

00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:54.580
LORENZO THIONE: So
like George said,

00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:56.130
we've been waiting
for a theater,

00:48:56.130 --> 00:48:59.210
and we hope something will
happen for us very soon,

00:48:59.210 --> 00:49:01.660
but we did come up and
George talked about it,

00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:04.130
we did come up with an
interesting idea for getting

00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:06.210
people who were
interested in the show

00:49:06.210 --> 00:49:07.780
and were following
its development

00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:12.250
and were eager to buy
tickets to go online, even

00:49:12.250 --> 00:49:16.450
today, and buy what we call the
Priority Access Pass for $5.

00:49:16.450 --> 00:49:18.670
You actually get
to be first in line

00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:20.660
to buy tickets to
the Broadway show

00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:23.140
before the tickets go on sale
to the general public, which

00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:25.740
is an interesting way
to sort of make sure

00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:29.550
that you have your pick to
whatever performance you want.

00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:32.540
You know, before anybody else
gets access to the tickets,

00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:35.140
you get your ability
to buy a ticket.

00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:37.620
And if you then come
to the show you also

00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:42.150
get a free download of the full
cast album, not the mini album.

00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:44.220
So it's definitely
a great value,

00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:46.220
and it's a great way for
us to know that there's

00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:48.900
a real audience out there
waiting for the show to happen.

00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:51.670
GEORGE TAKEI: And I might
add, for those of you who

00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:54.120
have friends and
relatives out of town who

00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:56.170
are going to be
coming to New York

00:49:56.170 --> 00:49:59.630
to see "Allegiance," it is
particularly a good idea

00:49:59.630 --> 00:50:02.540
to get a Priority Access
Pass, because you're not

00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:05.650
going to be here
for a long time.

00:50:05.650 --> 00:50:07.630
It's a limited period of time.

00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:12.290
And so you can have your
dibs on a pair of tickets

00:50:12.290 --> 00:50:14.540
before they go on
sale to the public

00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:17.850
and be assured that those
few days that they're

00:50:17.850 --> 00:50:21.200
going to be in town they
have a pair of tickets

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:24.820
to see the greatest show they're
going to see on Broadway,

00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:27.320
"Allegiance."

00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:29.934
JULIE JAMES: Well said.

00:50:29.934 --> 00:50:30.850
Do we have any other--

00:50:30.850 --> 00:50:31.700
GEORGE TAKEI: I'm
a television actor.

00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:33.310
I'm used to doing commercials.

00:50:33.310 --> 00:50:36.738
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:36.738 --> 00:50:38.229
JULIE JAMES: Yes, your question?

00:50:38.229 --> 00:50:39.020
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:41.220
I want to thank you
guys for coming.

00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:43.230
I love to ask Broadway
performers when

00:50:43.230 --> 00:50:45.300
they come a bit about
their experience,

00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:47.860
putting their own personality
into the show and ad libbing,

00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:49.484
but I think it's a
great opportunity we

00:50:49.484 --> 00:50:51.326
have some of the
behind the scenes group

00:50:51.326 --> 00:50:52.450
here that makes it happens.

00:50:52.450 --> 00:50:55.130
So I'd love to hear
from your perspective ad

00:50:55.130 --> 00:50:57.610
libbing, adapting the
show after it's written,

00:50:57.610 --> 00:51:00.160
is that something you
encourage, you have a part in?

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:01.930
Is that solely up to the actors?

00:51:01.930 --> 00:51:04.020
I'd love to hear
your take on that.

00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:08.380
STAFFORD ARIMA: Oh I think that
once a show has been written

00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:10.580
and we have a group
of authors who

00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:17.000
have created dialogue and
lyrics and specific words

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:21.630
to say that the hope
is that the actor will

00:51:21.630 --> 00:51:24.280
remain kind of on book.

00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:28.700
Meaning, will say the words
that have been written as is.

00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:34.050
I think that the element of
something feeling spontaneous

00:51:34.050 --> 00:51:37.720
on stage, which is why a
lot of audience members

00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:40.910
enjoy the live theater
performances because it does

00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:47.960
feel alive and spontaneous, that
comes from an actor's bringing

00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:52.870
to the material a kind of
reality of that moment.

00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:55.270
If a performer
perhaps kind of zones

00:51:55.270 --> 00:51:59.150
into just kind of
like doing it by rote,

00:51:59.150 --> 00:52:01.990
then the performance
might feel stale.

00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:06.760
But you know 99% of performers,
when they're in a show stay

00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:09.820
kind of alive with the
material, but still

00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:12.750
have the kind of context
of this is the words

00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:15.570
that I have to say, this is
the blocking that I have to do.

00:52:15.570 --> 00:52:19.430
Because in theater, you
know, lights are created,

00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:22.120
spotlights are created,
there are specific areas

00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:24.980
of the stage that the
actor needs to go to.

00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:26.870
So if the actor decided
one day, oh, I just

00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:32.160
want to walk around the stage
and not follow what was given,

00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:34.654
then he or she might be
out of the light and all

00:52:34.654 --> 00:52:35.570
of that kind of stuff.

00:52:35.570 --> 00:52:38.490
So I think, in
essence, spontaneity

00:52:38.490 --> 00:52:43.730
and an honest performance
will come from an aliveness,

00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:46.445
but still within the
context of the material.

00:52:46.445 --> 00:52:48.320
MARC ACITO: The performers
make it their own.

00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:50.340
I think that's what
the audience senses

00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:51.920
when it feels spontaneous.

00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:53.990
We watched Melinda
Doolittle today,

00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:57.169
and that's the first time
I've heard her sing that song.

00:52:57.169 --> 00:52:59.210
And, you know, hearing it
in context of the show,

00:52:59.210 --> 00:53:01.630
it feels like it's one thing,
and it's part of this story

00:53:01.630 --> 00:53:03.130
that we've already
been telling you,

00:53:03.130 --> 00:53:05.140
but what it pointed
out to me was just

00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:07.900
how universal that story is.

00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:10.120
How it felt like it was
Melinda Doolittle's story.

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:12.180
I'm thinking about, oh,
I didn't know she had,

00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:15.660
you know, a swing when she
was a kid, Melinda Doolittle.

00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:20.660
And we wrote it, but it felt--
they make it so their own,

00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:24.200
you feel as if it's
them speaking to you.

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:28.160
And with Melinda, I'd follow
her anywhere, you know.

00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:29.544
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:53:29.544 --> 00:53:30.710
JULIE JAMES: Great question.

00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:33.250
Great answers, everybody.

00:53:33.250 --> 00:53:34.820
We have some questions.

00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:36.600
We have a question
here in the audience.

00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:37.930
We also have some from online.

00:53:37.930 --> 00:53:40.150
So if you guys can
refresh my screen,

00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:42.205
I think we have
some questions that

00:53:42.205 --> 00:53:44.660
are coming in from
our online fan base.

00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:47.380
But what's your question
here in the audience today?

00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:49.010
AUDIENCE: Hi, this
is for George.

00:53:49.010 --> 00:53:51.540
I was curious how
much you had to do

00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:54.560
with the writing versus
just providing the story.

00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:56.760
Like did you provide dialogue?

00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:57.950
GEORGE TAKEI: No.

00:53:57.950 --> 00:54:01.810
We have some gifted
writers here.

00:54:01.810 --> 00:54:06.800
It actually began in
a Broadway theater.

00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:10.662
Brad and I went to
see-- well, actually it

00:54:10.662 --> 00:54:15.640
began in an off Broadway
theater, forbidden Broadway.

00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:19.860
And there were two guys
seated in front of us.

00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:23.240
They happen to be
Lorenzo and Jay, who

00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:26.560
I didn't know from Adam, but
they recognized my voice,

00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:32.100
and they turned around and
we chatted a little bit.

00:54:32.100 --> 00:54:35.220
I guess I have a
recognizable voice.

00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:37.310
And we saw that they
were theater lovers.

00:54:37.310 --> 00:54:40.640
And that evening Brad and I went
back to our apartment saying,

00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:44.100
yeah, it's wonderful to have
chatted with those guys.

00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:48.750
The next night we went
to see "In the Heights,"

00:54:48.750 --> 00:54:52.910
the Puerto Rican family
in Washington Heights,

00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:56.080
and we walked into
the theater and there

00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:58.800
were those two same guys
seated in the theater.

00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:02.150
JAY KUO: They thought that
we were stalking them.

00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:06.430
GEORGE TAKEI: And our
seats were in the same row.

00:55:06.430 --> 00:55:10.160
We did think you
were stalking us.

00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:12.650
JAY KUO: At some
point during Act One,

00:55:12.650 --> 00:55:15.860
there's a song called
"Inutil," which means useless.

00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:17.010
GEORGE TAKEI: Inutil.

00:55:17.010 --> 00:55:21.010
Your Spanish
pronunciation is terrible.

00:55:21.010 --> 00:55:23.590
JAY KUO: And I
looked over and I saw

00:55:23.590 --> 00:55:26.740
George crying during that song,
so during the intermission

00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:30.170
I asked him what had moved
him so much during that song,

00:55:30.170 --> 00:55:34.429
and he started telling me about
how the notion of uselessness

00:55:34.429 --> 00:55:36.470
really resonated with him
because his father felt

00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:39.204
so useless trying to
protect and preserve

00:55:39.204 --> 00:55:41.120
their family while they
were in the internment

00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:42.110
camps of Arkansas.

00:55:42.110 --> 00:55:45.220
And every hair on
my body stood on end

00:55:45.220 --> 00:55:48.050
because I was hearing for
the first time this story

00:55:48.050 --> 00:55:50.140
and realizing this
is a terrific story.

00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:52.154
And I just turned
to Lorenzo and I

00:55:52.154 --> 00:55:53.820
said are you thinking
what I'm thinking.

00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:54.815
And we said--

00:55:54.815 --> 00:55:57.190
LORENZO THIONE: It's like a
quintessential American epic.

00:55:57.190 --> 00:55:59.610
Just the type of struggle
that these people had

00:55:59.610 --> 00:56:02.530
to endure for a country that
many had come and sought

00:56:02.530 --> 00:56:05.840
after as a promised
land, was just

00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:07.950
something that we
thought was a story that

00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:09.731
would resonate with
audiences everywhere.

00:56:09.731 --> 00:56:11.480
JAY KUO: And so just
a few weeks later, we

00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:17.830
had sent sort of a review of it.

00:56:17.830 --> 00:56:19.626
LORENZO THIONE: Jay works fast.

00:56:19.626 --> 00:56:21.250
GEORGE TAKEI: Yeah,
a few weeks later I

00:56:21.250 --> 00:56:26.260
got a song on my computer,
and I listened to it,

00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:29.480
and I was bawling at
my computer again.

00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:32.500
And so I invited them to come to
the Japanese American National

00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:35.880
Museum, which we
founded in Los Angeles.

00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:38.040
It's an affiliate
of the Smithsonian,

00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:42.350
and introduced them to the
details of the internment

00:56:42.350 --> 00:56:43.832
experience.

00:56:43.832 --> 00:56:45.290
JULIE JAMES: That's
so fascinating.

00:56:45.290 --> 00:56:46.915
MARC ACITO: On top
of that, though, I'd

00:56:46.915 --> 00:56:49.030
like to add that the
story, of course,

00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:51.244
is inspired by
George's true story,

00:56:51.244 --> 00:56:52.660
and the creation
of the characters

00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:54.730
were really inspired
by him as well.

00:56:54.730 --> 00:56:56.410
When I came on to
the project George

00:56:56.410 --> 00:57:00.000
was playing Sam, which
is a very serious part,

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.020
and there's the chance for
him to play some high drama,

00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:05.660
but there wasn't any place
for him to play comedy.

00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:09.390
And I said, this
sci-fi legend has now

00:57:09.390 --> 00:57:11.580
become an internet
comedy legend and I said,

00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:14.130
you've got to give this
guy something to do.

00:57:14.130 --> 00:57:16.040
So we invented the
role of Ojii-San

00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:18.560
for him to be able to
have that other side.

00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:20.690
And it really speaks to
what inspired me most

00:57:20.690 --> 00:57:23.620
about the story,
is the absolute--

00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:28.140
the intrepid quality that the
Japanese American people had

00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:30.420
and the way they kept
their sense of humor

00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:32.031
and the way in
which they blossomed

00:57:32.031 --> 00:57:33.030
where they were planted.

00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:37.630
They grew so much
in their gardens

00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:40.770
that they actually had a surplus
that they supplied the war

00:57:40.770 --> 00:57:43.820
department in a place
that nobody ever

00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:44.990
thought anything would grow.

00:57:44.990 --> 00:57:47.060
They bloomed where
they were planted.

00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:49.670
It's a daily inspiration to us.

00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:53.070
I mean, truly you
have to own gaman.

00:57:53.070 --> 00:57:54.820
If the subway goes
away, and you're like,

00:57:54.820 --> 00:57:55.944
oh, I have a terrible life.

00:57:55.944 --> 00:57:58.630
You're like no one's putting
me in a camp, gaman, you know?

00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:04.410
JULIE JAMES: Perfectly said.

00:58:04.410 --> 00:58:07.575
We have a great question
from The G-dog in Fremont.

00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:12.250
Got to love that screen name.

00:58:12.250 --> 00:58:16.510
Having seen the
show in San Diego,

00:58:16.510 --> 00:58:18.430
I'm curious what
changes are being

00:58:18.430 --> 00:58:20.730
made for the eventual
Broadway version?

00:58:20.730 --> 00:58:22.258
Good question.

00:58:22.258 --> 00:58:23.530
MARC ACITO: A lot.

00:58:23.530 --> 00:58:25.946
STAFFORD ARIMA: Do you
want to speak to that?

00:58:25.946 --> 00:58:31.530
MARC ACITO: I think it
has become more refined.

00:58:31.530 --> 00:58:36.270
The show runs the gamut
in terms of its bandwidth

00:58:36.270 --> 00:58:38.960
of it's-- it'd be so easy
for this to be considered

00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:39.620
a tragedy.

00:58:39.620 --> 00:58:42.870
But at the same time, it's the
triumph of the human spirit.

00:58:42.870 --> 00:58:45.710
So finding that full
range and the balance

00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:47.410
between those
things where we can

00:58:47.410 --> 00:58:51.134
take the audience to despair
and then uplift them has been,

00:58:51.134 --> 00:58:52.050
I think, a real focus.

00:58:52.050 --> 00:58:53.890
JAY KUO: We've worked
on a lot of new music.

00:58:53.890 --> 00:58:57.430
And Lynne-- it's a real
pleasure to work with Lynne,

00:58:57.430 --> 00:58:59.770
arranging some of the
new songs and working

00:58:59.770 --> 00:59:02.315
that up together, especially
for this presentation.

00:59:02.315 --> 00:59:04.750
LYNNE SHANKEL: Yes.

00:59:04.750 --> 00:59:08.290
What the two ladies sang
today, "Stronger than Before,"

00:59:08.290 --> 00:59:11.890
was an arrangement that I made
specifically for this event.

00:59:11.890 --> 00:59:16.690
Like it's a lot poppier than
it is in the show itself,

00:59:16.690 --> 00:59:19.190
and we just kind
of wanted to show

00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:20.420
a different side of things.

00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:22.140
Along with what Jay
was saying, just

00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:25.630
to really show that these
themes really are universal.

00:59:25.630 --> 00:59:30.930
That it's not just a show
about Asians for Asians.

00:59:30.930 --> 00:59:32.830
That these themes are universal.

00:59:32.830 --> 00:59:37.380
I mean, I can relate
to all of the songs

00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:39.740
that we've sung today.

00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:42.950
But we have a lot of
exciting new material.

00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:45.040
Been working on a new
opening number, the number

00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:47.690
that you heard today,
and a couple more,

00:59:47.690 --> 00:59:49.566
and I'm so excited to
get back to work on it.

00:59:49.566 --> 00:59:51.898
LORENZO THIONE: I just want
to add just one thing, which

00:59:51.898 --> 00:59:54.890
is even San Diego came sort of
midway through a development

00:59:54.890 --> 00:59:59.060
process that had taken years,
and the process has continued.

00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:03.250
One thing that we've
been pleasantly

01:00:03.250 --> 01:00:06.460
surprised at the
fact that no matter

01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:08.220
how much the show had
changed, no matter

01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:11.210
how many new scenes, no matter
how many new numbers, no matter

01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:14.070
how many songs we would cut,
and there are more songs

01:00:14.070 --> 01:00:18.290
cut than there are in the
show, and then put back,

01:00:18.290 --> 01:00:20.960
it always felt
like the same show.

01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:23.420
It always felt like the
story we we're telling

01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:26.940
and the journey we were
bringing the audience with us on

01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:27.940
was the same one.

01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:30.130
And that sort of
reinforced in us

01:00:30.130 --> 01:00:31.910
the idea that we
were making progress

01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:34.579
towards the right goal.

01:00:34.579 --> 01:00:35.620
JULIE JAMES: Really good.

01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:36.700
How are we doing on time?

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:41.042
Do we have time for another
question from the online fans?

01:00:41.042 --> 01:00:42.000
MALE SPEAKER: One more.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.130
JULIE JAMES: All
right, one more.

01:00:44.130 --> 01:00:49.450
This is a good one from
JNN 38364 up in Ontario.

01:00:49.450 --> 01:00:52.220
Uncle George, which I
love that she calls you

01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:54.820
that, you have been through
so much in your life,

01:00:54.820 --> 01:00:57.070
was it difficult to play
a role in the production

01:00:57.070 --> 01:01:00.210
without getting overly
emotional, or was the show

01:01:00.210 --> 01:01:04.024
and sharing the story
more therapeutic?

01:01:04.024 --> 01:01:05.940
GEORGE TAKEI: Well, she's
my niece calling in.

01:01:10.730 --> 01:01:12.392
You know, the characters--

01:01:12.392 --> 01:01:14.266
JULIE JAMES: Wait, you
said I was your niece.

01:01:14.266 --> 01:01:16.307
GEORGE TAKEI: I have a
lot of nieces, believe me.

01:01:16.307 --> 01:01:17.690
JULIE JAMES: And nephews.

01:01:17.690 --> 01:01:19.920
GEORGE TAKEI: Blond haired
ones, red haired ones,

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:20.860
freckled face nieces.

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:30.890
This play is so specific and,
as was said, so universal.

01:01:30.890 --> 01:01:38.610
The characters are so rich and
so human and to be one of them,

01:01:38.610 --> 01:01:42.510
in this story, it
tears me apart.

01:01:42.510 --> 01:01:48.150
And I am reliving that
and, yes, it's a catharsis.

01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:51.230
I have a final
scene there as Sam

01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:56.660
that is an opportunity
for me to feel everything

01:01:56.660 --> 01:02:01.090
that I've felt as an
adult and let it hang out.

01:02:01.090 --> 01:02:04.410
It's a wonderful, wonderful,
personal as well as

01:02:04.410 --> 01:02:06.257
professional experience.

01:02:06.257 --> 01:02:08.590
JULIE JAMES: And I love that
you said it was your legacy

01:02:08.590 --> 01:02:11.570
and that just is
so, so touching.

01:02:11.570 --> 01:02:15.310
And we cannot wait to get
more news for "Allegiance"

01:02:15.310 --> 01:02:20.910
to come to Broadway,
in your words, 2015.

01:02:20.910 --> 01:02:23.530
Let's put the good joujou
out there everybody.

01:02:23.530 --> 01:02:25.930
I want to remind everyone
that on your way out

01:02:25.930 --> 01:02:29.450
today there is an "Allegiance"
CD for you to pick up.

01:02:29.450 --> 01:02:31.810
And, of course, as
George told everybody

01:02:31.810 --> 01:02:34.610
that's watching online, it's
available for free today

01:02:34.610 --> 01:02:35.650
on Google Play.

01:02:35.650 --> 01:02:40.630
So don't miss your chance to get
that great six songs for free.

01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:42.585
Especially, "Gaman,"
as we've all

01:02:42.585 --> 01:02:44.910
said, we all need some gaman.

01:02:44.910 --> 01:02:49.060
And I really want to thank
our incredible performers

01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:52.450
and special guests who
were here joining us today

01:02:52.450 --> 01:02:54.320
and our creative team.

01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:56.900
You did such a fantastic job.

01:02:56.900 --> 01:03:00.650
Of course, the one and
only, George Takei.

01:03:00.650 --> 01:03:02.150
Thank you all for being here.

01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:03.660
I'm Julie James.

01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:04.760
Thank you so much.

01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:05.660
[APPLAUSE]

01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:08.710
