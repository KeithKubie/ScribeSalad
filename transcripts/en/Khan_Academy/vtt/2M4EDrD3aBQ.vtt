00:00:00.191 --> 00:00:01.945
- [Voiceover] Hello
grammarians, hello Paige.

00:00:01.945 --> 00:00:03.172
- [Voiceover] Hi David.

00:00:03.172 --> 00:00:04.765
- [Voiceover] In the driver's seat.

00:00:04.765 --> 00:00:07.216
- [Voiceover] So, Paige,
today, it is my understanding

00:00:07.216 --> 00:00:09.881
that we are gonna talk
about the possessive.

00:00:09.881 --> 00:00:11.602
- [Voiceover] That's right.

00:00:11.602 --> 00:00:14.437
- [Voiceover] What even is
the possessive in English?

00:00:14.437 --> 00:00:17.309
What does that mean when we say that?

00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:19.515
What does it mean to possess something?

00:00:19.515 --> 00:00:21.399
- [Voiceover] Right, so that means to own

00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:23.116
something or to have something.

00:00:23.116 --> 00:00:25.525
- [Voiceover] Okay, so this
relates to the apostrophe,

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:28.092
in that we use the
apostrophe in many cases,

00:00:28.092 --> 00:00:31.779
we use the apostrophe s in
many cases to show possession.

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:33.825
Right, so if I were
talking about, there are

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:35.179
a couple of ways to show that something

00:00:35.179 --> 00:00:38.699
belongs to someone or
something in English,

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:42.220
like I could say, the carrot that

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.007
belonged to that rabbit was delicious.

00:00:45.007 --> 00:00:47.136
- [Voiceover] Yeah, but
that's pretty complicated,

00:00:47.136 --> 00:00:50.696
and can make sentences much
longer than they need to be.

00:00:50.696 --> 00:00:53.284
- [Voiceover] So what's
a simpler way of saying

00:00:53.284 --> 00:00:56.466
the carrot that belonged to
the rabbit was delicious.

00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:57.407
- [Voiceover] You can say something like

00:00:57.407 --> 00:00:59.982
the rabbit's carrot was delicious.

00:00:59.982 --> 00:01:02.190
- [Voiceover] Oh, interesting,
so you're actually

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.067
containing, there's like
a lot of information

00:01:04.067 --> 00:01:08.294
that's contained within the
rabbit's, that little thing.

00:01:08.294 --> 00:01:09.782
'Cause you're expressing the relationship

00:01:09.782 --> 00:01:12.062
between the rabbit and the carrot,

00:01:12.062 --> 00:01:13.660
just with that little apostrophe s,

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.512
that contains so much information in it.

00:01:15.512 --> 00:01:18.509
- [Voiceover] Yeah, the
whole idea of the rabbit

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.609
owning the carrot comes
from that apostrophe s.

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:22.796
- [Voiceover] That's super cool.

00:01:22.796 --> 00:01:24.594
- [Voiceover] Yeah,
it's a pretty big deal.

00:01:24.594 --> 00:01:26.035
- [Voiceover] So this
doesn't just apply to

00:01:26.035 --> 00:01:27.807
common nouns, like rabbits, this can also

00:01:27.807 --> 00:01:30.061
apply to proper nouns, like people,

00:01:30.061 --> 00:01:32.274
or countries, or businesses, or whatever.

00:01:32.274 --> 00:01:34.900
- [Voiceover] Totally.
- [Voiceover] Or movies.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.701
- [Voiceover] Yeah, anything, I think

00:01:36.701 --> 00:01:40.873
- [Voiceover] Okay, so
to pull a completely

00:01:40.873 --> 00:01:43.093
random figure from American history,

00:01:43.093 --> 00:01:46.166
let's say Alexander
Hamilton had a surfboard.

00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:47.512
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:01:47.512 --> 00:01:48.990
- [Voiceover] So, we could say, using the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.238
apostrophe s construction,
we could refer to

00:01:51.238 --> 00:01:54.831
Alexander Hamilton's surfboard, right?

00:01:54.831 --> 00:01:56.186
- [Voiceover] Right, the surfboard that

00:01:56.186 --> 00:01:58.161
belongs to Alexander Hamilton.

00:01:58.161 --> 00:02:00.572
- [Voiceover] Alright, so that
seems pretty straightforward.

00:02:00.572 --> 00:02:04.057
If we wanna show possession,
we just add an apostrophe s.

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:06.303
Is that true in all cases though?

00:02:06.303 --> 00:02:07.814
- [Voiceover] Well, okay, not always.

00:02:07.814 --> 00:02:09.756
- [Voiceover] Okay, so there's a wrinkle.

00:02:09.756 --> 00:02:11.433
- [Voiceover] Of course,
there's always a wrinkle.

00:02:11.433 --> 00:02:13.823
- [Voiceover] Introduce
for us this wrinkle, Paige.

00:02:13.823 --> 00:02:15.225
- [Voiceover] So, there's an exception

00:02:15.225 --> 00:02:17.565
to this rule of using apostrophe s

00:02:17.565 --> 00:02:20.177
for possession when
you're using a pronoun.

00:02:20.177 --> 00:02:21.942
- [Voiceover] Ah!
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:02:21.942 --> 00:02:25.912
- [Voiceover] So, rabbit
and Alexander Hamilton

00:02:25.912 --> 00:02:28.318
are both nouns, but there are pronouns

00:02:28.318 --> 00:02:32.292
like it, or he, or she, where you don't

00:02:32.292 --> 00:02:34.580
use an apostrophe to show possessive.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.016
- [Voiceover] So if I wanted to say,

00:02:36.016 --> 00:02:38.998
that surfboard is his, there's

00:02:38.998 --> 00:02:40.390
no apostrophe in there, right?

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.057
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:02:43.007 --> 00:02:44.773
- [Voiceover] Or, we
could just as easily say

00:02:44.773 --> 00:02:47.728
his surfboard, and I think
that's the same as saying

00:02:47.728 --> 00:02:51.492
that surfboard is Alexander Hamilton's.

00:02:51.492 --> 00:02:55.624
And you can see that there's
this real, it makes sense

00:02:55.624 --> 00:02:59.791
to want to put a possessive
apostrophe s in there,

00:03:01.136 --> 00:03:03.739
right, but that's not what you do.

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:04.805
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:03:04.805 --> 00:03:06.255
- [Voiceover] This is this one kind of

00:03:06.255 --> 00:03:08.214
obnoxious exception to the rule.

00:03:08.214 --> 00:03:11.200
So, for possessive pronouns, they don't,

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.061
they just, they never take apostrophes.

00:03:14.061 --> 00:03:15.378
- [Voiceover] That's right.

00:03:15.378 --> 00:03:17.019
- [Voiceover] Okay, so
the possessive in English

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.194
usually formed with apostrophe s,

00:03:19.194 --> 00:03:21.532
The rabbit's carrot was delicious,

00:03:21.532 --> 00:03:23.865
Alexander Hamilton's surfboard,

00:03:23.865 --> 00:03:25.505
but when we're talking
about possessive pronouns

00:03:25.505 --> 00:03:29.098
like his, or hers, or ours, or theirs,

00:03:29.098 --> 00:03:32.515
or my, or its, no apostrophes are needed.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.099
Possessive pronouns
never take apostrophes.

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.999
- [Voiceover] You got it.

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:39.433
- [Voiceover] Sweet, thanks Paige.

00:03:39.433 --> 00:03:40.572
- [Voiceover] Thank you.

00:03:40.572 --> 00:03:42.255
- [Voiceover] You can
learn anything, David out.

00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:44.022
- [Voiceover] Paige out.
