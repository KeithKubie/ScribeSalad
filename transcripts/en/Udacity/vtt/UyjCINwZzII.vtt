Of course, I will focus here is on constraint propagation,

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.430
not on computive vision, we are simply using some aspect of computive vision

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.190
to illustrate constraint propagation. In particular, let us zoom into

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:18.150
a specific subtask of object recognition, In this subtask, lines

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.350
are grouped into surfaces and the orientations of the surfaces are identified

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.000
via the perpendiculars. The method we'll use for this task is called,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.240
line labelling, the method of line labelling makes extensive use of constraints.
