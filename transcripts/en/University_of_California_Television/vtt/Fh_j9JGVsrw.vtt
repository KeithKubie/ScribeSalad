00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
(chimes and mouse clicks)

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.790
(piano music)

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.370
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical eight.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.923
Bipedal, naked, large brained,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.713
long the master of fire,
tools, and language.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.023
But still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.913
Aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.883
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.683
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.243
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.273
We empathize, and deceive.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.760
We shape the future from
our shared understanding

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.693
of the past.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.160
Carta brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.230
to exchange insights on who we are

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.703
and how we got here.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.960
An exploration made possible

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.737
by the generosity by humans, like you.

00:01:15.064 --> 00:01:17.981
(electronic music)

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:23.222
(upbeat music)

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.080
- Thank you for the invitations.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.660
It's been really exciting for me.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.930
And this talk is gonna be about brains.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.460
And I'm not gonna actually
talk about primates or humans,

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.850
but I'm gonna come to some conclusions

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.230
about humans and culture.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.380
This is a brain of a bottlenose dolphin,

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.690
a back of a brain of a bottlenose dolphin,

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.280
and this is a brain of a small marsupial.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.370
And you can see the
neocortex is really large,

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.620
and I'm gonna talk about
the neocortex today,

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.520
very specifically for a couple of reasons.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.738
One is that it's the part of the brain

00:01:59.738 --> 00:02:04.450
that's changed most dramatically
in mammals over time,

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:05.380
and in humans in particular,

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.320
they have an extremely large neocortex.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.700
It's a part of the brain

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.400
that's involved in cognition, language,

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.010
and things like tool use.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.580
The question that we're
interested in addressing

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.720
in my laboratory is how the
brain gets more complex,

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.740
or how the neocortex gets more complex.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.990
We know that early mammals had a neocortex

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.820
that was very, very tiny and
had a few cortical fields.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.267
And cortical fields are
the functional units

00:02:29.267 --> 00:02:30.830
of the neocortex.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.460
And we know that if brains evolved,

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.590
and particularly primate brains,

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.423
the neocortex became

00:02:35.423 --> 00:02:37.790
a really, really, enormous cortical sheet

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.140
that now is proposed,

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.630
humans are proposed to have
hundreds of cortical fields.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.320
So the question is how do you get

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.740
from a very, very simple form

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.320
to a very, very complicated form?

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.570
But this is a serious problem to address,

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.470
because these types of changes,

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.480
certainly from early mammals,

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.330
are 200 million years of changes.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.320
And we can even see the sorts of changes

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.730
that have occurred in the human line

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.570
over a six million year period.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:00.900
So how do you address these changes?

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:01.733
And there are two ways

00:03:01.733 --> 00:03:04.710
that you can get at this
question of evolution.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.300
You can look at, you can do, you can say

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.890
what has evolution produced?

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.910
And the way we can understand
what evolution is produced,

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.220
is we look at brains and bodies.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.700
We do a comparative approach.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.930
So I can look at a lot of different brains

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.810
using a variety of different techniques,

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.630
electrophysiological, anatomical,

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.010
and I can say, "What sorts
of changes have come about?"

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.510
The problem is evolution
is a moving picture,

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.720
and the life of an individual
is a moving picture,

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.360
so anytime we study an
individual or a mammal,

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.100
we're taking one snapshot of
that moving picture of life,

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.520
and trying to figure it out.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.060
So what we do with a comparative analysis,

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.950
is we look at a lot of snapshots

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.580
and try to put this moving
picture back together.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.710
However, while these sort
of comparisons can tell us

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.010
what evolution has produced,

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.840
they don't tell us how
phenotypic transformations occur.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.150
How do I get more cortical fields?

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.000
How do I change connections of a cortex,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.740
which in turn, changes behavior.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.230
And this is where studies of
development come into place,

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.190
because the evolution of any aspect

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.190
of the body, the brain,

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.100
is actually the evolution
of developmental mechanisms

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.460
that give rise to that
aspect of the phenotype.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.360
So I'm gonna, my talk is gonna
focus a little bit on this.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.730
Comparative analysis, this
is many, many years of work.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.070
This is a cladogram,

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.230
and these are neocortices,

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.500
And you're gonna see
these sort of cartoons

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.770
throughout the talk.

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:16.630
This is a neocortex.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.270
These red, and blue, and yellow areas

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:20.680
indicate cortical fields.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.610
And the most important thing
to take away from this,

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.420
is that you could have common answers

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.700
which we don't know about.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.180
Humans, Macaque monkeys, cats, squirrels,

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.460
there is a constellation
of cortical fields

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.070
that all species possess.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.410
Even in the absence of use,

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.380
and this is due to inheritance
from a common ancestry.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.470
And it's also due to the way

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.130
genes are deployed in development,

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.030
but that's gonna be a different story.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.600
So there are similarities in brains.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.250
Even my brain is very similar
to a mouse brain in some ways,

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.400
but it's also very different.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.220
And here are some of the source

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.160
of differences you're gonna see.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.200
This is a flattened view of the neocortex,

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.090
this is the front of the brain,

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.100
this is the top of the brain.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.400
This is a Macaque monkey,

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.280
and this is a mouse.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.260
And they're not drawn to scale.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.100
This would actually,

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.390
this mouse neocortex would
be a little tiny portion

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:01.960
of the Macaque neocortex.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.260
And what we can see is
that there are changes in

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.810
the size of the cortical sheet,

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.060
there are changes in
cortical field number,

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.510
there are changes in the
relative size of cortical fields,

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.440
there are changes in
the connection patterns

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.210
of homologous cortical fields.

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.110
And of course the question is

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.790
to what extent, these
differences due to genes,

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.550
that are intrinsic to
the developing neocortex,

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.050
have they changed in species over time?

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.240
And they probably have.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.290
Genes associate with the
development of the body.

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.590
Because the body changes,
we use the body differently

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.690
and you cannot think about the brain

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:31.870
without thinking about the body.

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:32.980
There's a middle man there, right?

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.500
The brain is not embodied itself.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.630
It needs the body to give it,

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.650
provide all information about the world.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.060
Epigenetic influences, and by this,

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.010
I mean sensory-driven, or environmental,

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.093
or context-driven changes
to the brain and the body.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.940
Or is it some combination
of these factors?

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.100
Is any creature, due to
just one sort of thing,

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.730
or is it some combination
in different species

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.500
over the course of evolution?

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.190
So I'm gonna give you some
examples of comparative work

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.090
in changes in peripheral
morphology that give us some clue

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.730
about what the answer to that question is.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:09.930
So this is one of my very
favorite examples on the planet.

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.170
It's the duck-billed platypus,

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:12.340
and this is a real animal.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.223
This is the bill, and
what's really cool...

00:06:14.223 --> 00:06:15.410
(laughs)
(audience laughs)

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:16.250
Yeah, and I had it,

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.640
and the reason I'm also
interested in the body,

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.490
is when I started working on
different animals in Australia,

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.420
I had to catch every
single animal I worked on,

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.770
and it gives you a really,
really great appreciation

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.110
for the body and how important it is,

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.890
because they're hard to catch.

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:29.670
Anyway, I digress.

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:31.490
So what's really cool about the platypus,

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.790
is that it has mechanosensory receptors

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.280
that are exquisitely sensitive to touch.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.160
Interdigitated with electrosensory
receptors on its bill,

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.640
and when it does anything important,

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.510
capture prey items, mate,

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.500
it closes its eyes, its ears, and its nose

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.630
so all it has is a bill.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:47.990
And if you look at its neocortex

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.160
using electrophysiological
recording techniques,

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.980
this is the front of the brain,

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.860
this is the top of the brain,

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.430
this is the representation of the bill

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.030
on the cortical sheet.

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:58.100
There are a number of cortical fields,

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.380
so within the somatosensory cortex,

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.920
it takes up about 90% of
the entire representation

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.140
of the somatosensory cortex.

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:06.670
And if you look at the cortex itself,

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:09.620
it takes up about 75% of
the entire cortical sheet.

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.703
This animal is one big, huge bill.

00:07:11.703 --> 00:07:12.548
(audience laughs)

00:07:12.548 --> 00:07:14.010
(laughs) And it's hard to imagine,

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:15.870
this is called cortical magnification.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.370
And the question is,

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.250
is this due to genes
intrinsic to the neocortex

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:21.360
that have made this
cortex one big, huge bill?

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.193
Changes to the body?

00:07:22.193 --> 00:07:23.610
It has to be to some extent,

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.420
due to changes in the
body, the environment,

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:29.410
and how the animal uses the
body in the environment.

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:31.580
And I gave you the example
of the duck-billed platypus,

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.550
because it's an extraordinary example

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:35.240
of cortical magnification.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.190
But we must appreciate

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.410
that we see this across the
board in a lot of species,

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:39.410
including humans.

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:42.910
If you look at the evolution
of the supralaryngeal tract

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:45.540
and the specializations
of this body morphology,

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:48.890
we have an expanded representation
in somatosensory cortex,

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:52.510
motor cortex, premotor cortex
of this specialized structure,

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:53.730
which we call Broca's area.

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:55.683
So they are following the same rules

00:07:55.683 --> 00:07:57.793
of evolution as other species.

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:01.430
I'm gonna switch really rapidly

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.730
to experimental manipulations
in peripheral morphology,

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:04.840
so it's okay.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:08.380
To what extent is the ratio
of incoming sensory inputs

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.850
to the developing neocortex,

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:12.900
determining the functional
organization of the neocortex?

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.110
And for this, we used little
short-tailed opossums.

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:17.060
They are models of early blindness.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.220
We bilaterally enucleator removed the eyes

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.360
when these animals are embryos.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.070
So it's just like, basically
a little layer of skin.

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:23.050
We let them grow up,

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:24.224
and we looked at the connections,

00:08:24.224 --> 00:08:26.720
we look at the functional
organization of their brain,

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.840
and what we see is that here's
visual cortex in this animal.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:30.800
This is the front of the brain,

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.840
and this is the top of the brain.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.110
And all of what would
normally be visual cortex,

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:35.290
which is in blue here,

00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:36.520
is now processing inputs

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.210
from the somatosensory
and auditory system.

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:40.500
So we totally functionally
changed the reorganization

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.120
of this neocortex.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.510
And if we look at the connections,

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:45.830
these are connections, this is,

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:48.040
these are visualaries here in blue,

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.190
primary visual cortex.

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:51.290
And it's getting input from
other visual structures.

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:53.270
These are auditory structures in yellow,

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:55.190
and somatosensory structures in red.

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:57.400
And what we see in our bilateral nucleus,

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.530
is that now the connections
of the brain have changed.

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:01.150
We've done nothing to
the neocortex itself,

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:02.040
not one thing.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.170
We've simply removed all visual input

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:05.460
really early in development.

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.700
And what we see is this
functional takeover

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.160
and connectional takeover
of the developing brain.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:14.240
And if we look at what that
region is representing,

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.860
which would normally be visual,

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:17.840
it's representing the
head and the verbrice.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.500
We basically, I wanna say,
we made a platypus, right?

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.650
So something like 80% of the neocortex

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:24.950
is now processing inputs from this stuff.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:27.300
From the verbrice, and
the snout, and the face.

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:31.520
And we did, and of course
it's great to have a big brain

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.130
and transform the neocortex,

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:34.140
but you have to ask yourself,

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.400
what does this mean for behavior?

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.250
Which is the targeted selection.

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:39.720
We had trained discrimination
tasks, and natural behavior,

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.050
and I wanted to show
you the natural behavior

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:42.250
'cause it's really cool.

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:47.020
These animals, they end up
becoming super tactile animals.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:47.960
They do really, really well

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.460
with tactile discrimination tasks.

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:50.620
This is a ladder rung task,

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:53.500
where the animal starts
at one end of this ladder,

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:54.540
and moves to the other end.

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:57.780
And you train him to walk
on evenly spaced rungs.

00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:59.750
And then what you do is, (laughs)

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:02.310
you then space the rungs unevenly,

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:03.640
and you have 'em do this task again.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:04.960
And I'm gonna show you
some movies of this.

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:05.810
This is a normal animal,

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:07.310
this is a bilateral enucleate.

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:09.280
And this is really pretty beautiful.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.250
So here's what a normal animal looks like,

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:13.280
and you can score them based on

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.230
when their legs fall through,
and how well they do.

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:16.240
You'll see this.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.044
And, you know, is he legs
falling through, oops.

00:10:18.044 --> 00:10:19.040
(audience laughs)

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.220
Whoops.

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.390
Oops.

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:22.223
Ya know.

00:10:22.223 --> 00:10:25.000
He was trained, but this
is now a novel task.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.250
Here's the bilateral enucleate.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:28.040
No eyes, whatsoever, right?

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:32.222
So it's never had any access
to visual input, ever.

00:10:32.222 --> 00:10:33.650
This is what the bilateral
enucleate looks like

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:35.700
on this novel task, look at this.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:36.533
Bam.

00:10:36.533 --> 00:10:37.366
(audience mumbles)

00:10:37.366 --> 00:10:38.793
Okay, this is good.

00:10:41.128 --> 00:10:43.287
We propose that because the
whiskers are so important,

00:10:43.287 --> 00:10:45.740
you have this huge representation
of the whiskers now.

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.345
We trimmed the whiskers.

00:10:47.345 --> 00:10:49.200
(audience groans)
I know, I know, I know.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.070
They grew back, they grew back, okay?

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:52.490
But check this out, this is so cool.

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:55.470
Look, this is the same animal
with his whiskers trimmed,

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:57.429
and here's what happens.

00:10:57.429 --> 00:10:59.060
(audience mumbles)
Right?

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:00.870
So with this, this is really cool

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:02.790
because you were showing
this enormous brain change

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:03.830
and behavior change,

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.570
and that the two coincide.

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:08.980
And just to end this
little tiny portion of it,

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.320
so blindness is not an absence of light.

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.840
Because this animal has a
functional respecification,

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.917
changes in cortical and
subcortical connections,

00:11:16.917 --> 00:11:19.560
a really big magnification
of its verbrice,

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:23.450
so its entire nervous system has been

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:25.070
kind of rewired and reorganized

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:26.930
based on this lack of sensory input.

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:27.763
But that's pretty,

00:11:27.763 --> 00:11:29.630
that's sort of like taking a
sledgehammer to the system.

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:31.240
Let me show you something
a little more subtle.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.460
This is natural differences
in rearing conditions,

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:35.690
cultural transmission of rearing style.

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:36.630
And these are voles.

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:38.090
Voles are biparental.

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:39.790
They both, both parents rear their young.

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:41.120
And we can measure differences

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.540
in total tactile contact of the young.

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.980
We look at high contact parents,
and low contact parents.

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:47.370
And important to remember,

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:50.320
is that high contact offspring
show differences in behavior,

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.970
high contact offspring
become high contact parents,

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:54.930
and if you cross foster
them on the day of birth,

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:56.400
you take low contact parents

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.880
and put them with high contact parents,

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.240
they become high contact parents.

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:02.350
So this is a social
transmission of a rearing style.

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:03.650
And if we look at the connections

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:04.820
of their somatosensory cortex,

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:05.780
particularly in the regions

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:07.600
of the body that are being touched,

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.470
we see that connections
are mostly the same.

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:12.500
This is an injection site, and
these are connections to it.

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.460
But we also see
differences in connections.

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:15.800
And remember, this is pretty subtle.

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.870
And differences in connections
of frontal cortex as well.

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:20.760
So what factors contributed
to the phenotypes?

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.760
So I'm just showing you a
much more subtle example

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.050
of the role of sensory input

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:28.430
in shaping the brain and
shaping connectivity.

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:31.950
Well, genes definitely contribute
to cortical sheet size,

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:33.910
cortical field size, cortical connections,

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:35.220
peripheral morphology.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.810
And cellular mechanisms
involved in plasticity

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:39.550
may be genetically specified,

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:41.490
which allows the environment to impact

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:42.750
some of these same things.

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:44.980
I can change cortical field
size, cortical connectivity,

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:47.690
peripheral morphology, which
I showed in these experiments.

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:50.030
And I've given you examples
from the bill of the platypus,

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:53.500
and I suggest that the same
thing is occurring in humans.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:54.333
But what about things

00:12:54.333 --> 00:12:56.840
like social learning,
language, and culture?

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.810
I would suggest that the
best way to think about these

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:03.290
as these are simply complex
patterns of physical stimuli

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:05.170
that are impinging on the
developing nervous system.

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:10.040
So mother's love is temperature,
touch, cadence of a voice,

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:10.873
nothing more.

00:13:10.873 --> 00:13:14.920
And this can impact how
the brain wires itself.

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:16.610
It can impact size of cortical fields,

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:18.240
and connections of cortical fields.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.110
So I'm gonna end a little bit with this.

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:22.840
This is a sort of a human evolution,

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:23.850
not quite a cladogram.

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:26.000
And on the bottom is
environment and social context,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.530
and on the top, it's
sort of truncated here,

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:32.980
is meant to be sort of
morphology or genes.

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.570
And modern hand is proposed
to have been around this

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:37.380
for about 700,000 years.

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:39.120
But what's really pretty fascinating

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.160
is that until recently,
we were using stone tools.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.010
So we had, and big brains
happened way back here, right?

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:48.070
So we had the big brain,
we had the modern hand,

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:50.550
but we were not doing what we're
doing with the modern hand.

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:52.330
And if you believe that all behaviors

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:53.330
is generated by the brain,

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:55.490
and I believe that all behavior's
generated by the brain,

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:57.000
then the brain must have changed.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.570
And if the brain didn't change
by changes in DNA sequence,

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:02.200
it must have changes by
activity dependent mechanisms,

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.233
and/or culture.

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:07.560
It's hard to believe that
the Industrial Revolution

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:09.320
was less than 300 years ago.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.153
And if you look,

00:14:10.153 --> 00:14:11.970
we actually changed the
scape of this planet.

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:14.360
And now we have daily and
prolonged interactions

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.560
with computers, and machines, and tools,

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:17.940
really sophisticated tools.

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:19.540
And I'll end by saying

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:21.710
we are combinatorial creatures
constructed by genes,

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:23.840
bodies, behaviors, and
environmental context.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.270
And I think, you can look for the genes

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:27.760
that are distinguishing humans,

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.370
I think you're gonna find only a few,

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:32.040
maybe some involved in
expansion of the neocortex.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.490
But humans have evolved
an extraordinary capacity

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:35.790
to construct our neocortex

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:38.890
over the course of a prolonged
infancy and childhood,

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:41.000
allowing for rapid phenotypic change

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.380
even within a single generation.

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:45.800
I would say that if Leah
Krubitzer born 30 years ago,

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:49.240
or hundred years ago,
or 300,000 years ago,

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.900
I wouldn't be Leah Krubitzer,

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:53.410
have kidney rock, or using a spear.

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:55.130
I would be a different brain.

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:57.170
We have a remarkable
fluid brain/body interface

00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:58.003
with the environment,

00:14:58.003 --> 00:14:58.890
such that tools and machines

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:02.490
can extend our embodiment
and our peripersonal space

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:04.390
and expand the loop between
our brains, our bodies,

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:05.223
and the world.

00:15:05.223 --> 00:15:08.490
And I think this has made us
unique biohybrid creatures

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:10.720
whose brains adapt and
bootstrap themselves

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.880
with the technologies
that we give rise to,

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.300
and for better or worse,

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.830
with whom our futures are
increasingly entwined.

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:18.029
Okay, thank you.

00:15:18.029 --> 00:15:21.029
(audience applauds)

00:15:22.895 --> 00:15:25.478
(upbeat music)
