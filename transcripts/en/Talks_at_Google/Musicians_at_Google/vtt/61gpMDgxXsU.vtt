ANGELA PRIMAVERA:
Hi, everyone.

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.600
I'm Angela Primavera, curriculum
specialist here at

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.410
the Google Children's Center.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.880
And when I was thinking about
a phrase that could describe

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.530
our next guest, what kept coming
to mind was the power

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.110
of connection.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.192
For anyone who's been to a
Michael Franti show, you know

00:00:18.192 --> 00:00:20.980
that he has a way of reaching
out to each and every member

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.940
of the audience.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.230
For over 20 years, Michael has
found a way to connect not

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.960
only with his musical fans, but
people around the globe.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.660
Whether it's bridging a
conversation using just his

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.270
guitar, as documented in his
film "I Know I'm Not Alone,"

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.710
or utilizing technology to
connect to his fans in FranTV,

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.320
or even his Power to the
Peaceful festivals right here

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.200
in the Bay Area, Michael Franti
embraces the power of

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.780
connection.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.020
More recently, he's used his
poetic abilities to connect

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.610
with our newest generation of
environmental stewards in his

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.000
children's book "Where in the
World Is Away?" In partnership

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.320
with Talks at Google, Google
Play, and the Google

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.410
Children's Center's Parent
Education Series, I'm honored

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.280
to offer Googlers this
opportunity to connect once

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.521
again with Michael Franti.

00:01:15.521 --> 00:01:23.868
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:23.868 --> 00:01:25.950
MICHAEL FRANTI: How's
it going, y'all?

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.626
How you feeling?

00:01:28.626 --> 00:01:30.940
All right.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.750
Well, I was really excited to
come to Google today because,

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.070
well, there's this urban myth
about Google, which is--

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.740
that I--

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.530
can you push that
in for me, Jay?

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.140
That I believed up until about
15 minutes ago, which is that

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.790
when you type in something on
Google, there's this giant

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.270
room full of 1,000 people
in lab coats.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.350
And they see what you've typed
in, like Roberto Clemente's

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.600
batting average in 1967.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.009
And then a guy gets up, and he
runs down this corridor to

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.050
this shelf full of books
and encyclopedias.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.940
And he pulls it out, and
he thumbs through it.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.230
And then he slams it shut,
and then he runs back.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.840
And he types in 323.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.460
And I found out that it's
not actually true.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.800
So maybe you should
be a myth buster.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.300
JAY BOWMAN: Myth buster.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.770
MICHAEL FRANTI: But it is true
that kids love music, right?

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.598
Make noise, kids.

00:02:40.598 --> 00:02:42.600
I love this kid with
the sunglasses.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.000
So let play some music.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.470
It goes like this.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.525
One, two, three.

00:02:46.525 --> 00:02:46.970
Uh-huh.

Awesome.

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:34.406
Well, I wrote a book.

00:07:34.406 --> 00:07:35.460
I wrote two books, actually.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.310
This one's called "What I Be,"
and this one's called "Where

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:39.030
in the World is Away?"

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:42.430
I'm going to read from this one
today because April is a

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:43.475
very important month.

00:07:43.475 --> 00:07:45.840
Do you know why April is
an important month?

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:49.180
We have a birthday that we
celebrate in April every year.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.955
And you know who was
born in April?

00:07:51.955 --> 00:07:53.610
The earth.

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:55.670
The earth was-- you
can Google it.

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:59.290
Earth was born in April.

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:02.670
And this is a book that's about

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:04.840
taking care of our Earth.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:09.130
And it's called, "Where in the
World is Away?" And it goes a

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:10.880
little something like this.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.060
Little Lee and little
Lou sat by a lake,

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.170
sharing a bottle of juice.

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:19.830
It was a warm, sunny day, and
the birds where at play.

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:23.690
And they smiled as they
watched mama goose.

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:26.620
As they finished the drink, Lou
pulled back his arm and

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.560
said, I'm going to
throw it away.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.300
Stop, Lou.

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:33.440
Think, before you make
a mistake, where in

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.460
the world is away?

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:39.690
If we throw it in the lake,
it's gone for today.

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:42.580
But is that really away?

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:46.185
Not for the frogs who hip hop
on the logs or the fish who

00:08:46.185 --> 00:08:49.540
jump up in the air or the little
tiny things that live

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:52.715
off the greens that grow on
the bottom down there.

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:58.990
All of our spills just fill up
their gills, and it's so hard

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:00.850
to breathe without air.

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:02.510
They play hide and
go seek, and they

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:05.280
think, school is cool.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.950
So we shouldn't make
a mess down there.

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:10.530
I've got a plan, Lou
started to say.

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.700
Over the hill's where
I'll throw it away.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:17.120
Not so fast, Lou,
if I may say.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.130
Is over the hill there
really away?

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:20.970
What do you kids think?

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:21.980
Is that really away?

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:22.720
AUDIENCE: No.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.310
MICHAEL FRANTI: No.

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:26.560
That's where the forest
grows, tall and wide.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.630
And all kinds of critters
live deep inside.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:32.560
It's cool in the daytime
and warm at night.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:36.980
And squirrels do twirls while
birds are in flight.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:38.600
There's nuts, and
there's berries.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.770
There's bears, and there's
fairies and a

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:43.030
butterfly up in a tree.

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:46.740
By the light of the moon, they
play drums with raccoons as

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:51.140
the mice shout, one,
two, three.

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:54.400
Can I hear you kids say, one,
two, three, like mice?

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.240
AUDIENCE: One, two, three.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:56.660
MICHAEL FRANTI: Yay!

00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:00.420
[LAUGHS]

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:04.170
But if the forest has bottles
on a hot, sunny day, the sun

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:07.970
magnifies and might set it
ablaze, then all of the forest

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:10.310
beings would run
with a fright.

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:12.210
We don't want that, Lou.

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:14.450
No, you're right.

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:17.100
Lou said, let's just throw
it here on the street.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.190
Someone will come and
eventually sweep.

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:23.580
But look down below, even
up through the cracks.

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:27.290
There grows the tiniest
blades of green grass.

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:31.040
And where there is grass,
then grasshoppers be.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.260
And where there are
grasshoppers,

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.380
let's let them be.

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:38.050
And besides, we all like to
keep the street neat.

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:42.780
And we don't need glass where
there might be bare feet.

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.590
There's far too much garbage.

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:46.150
It's just got to stop.

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:51.220
The landfills are filling
right up to the top.

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:54.890
Then where is away, said
confused little Lou.

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:58.250
And what of the bottle when
there's no more juice?

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:02.860
They spotted a bin with a round
symbol on it, and can

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:05.660
with the word recycling on it.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:09.580
And inside the can there were
hundreds of bottles in all

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:13.790
kinds of shapes and
colors and models.

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:17.620
If we put it in there, will it
go away, sweet little Lou

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:19.290
started to say.

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:22.510
Lee opened her mouth to
say, we'll never know.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:27.300
And just as she did,
along came a crow.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:32.200
This grow at her feet was oh,
so unique, a crow named Mo

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.860
with a beak that could speak.

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:37.130
Good heavens, they shouted.

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:38.520
How could this be?

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:40.350
The crow said, relax.

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:42.270
It's just a little old me.

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:45.060
If you'd like to know where old
bottle should go, close

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:51.470
your eyes, spread your wings,
and follow this crow.

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:55.020
The bottles are picked up by
truck and transported to a

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:59.480
glass sorting center, then
they are sorted.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:02.620
Green ones go there, and
brown ones go here.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:07.620
There's places for blue and
for yellow and clear.

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:10.140
All of the paper and
caps are removed.

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:14.430
And yes, even those things
are recycled too.

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:18.430
All of the glass gets crushed
into cullet, a word you

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:20.870
mightn't heard, but that's
what they call it.

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:29.910
Then it's thrown into a
furnace to heat to a

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:33.110
temperature of over
2000 degrees.

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:36.020
And then when it's melted,
it glows into goo.

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:41.810
And then there are so many
things you can do.

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:45.560
You can bend it and shape it and
pour it into molds, make

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:48.480
magical art work or
things to be sold.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:51.880
And when it cools down, it
turns hard very fast and

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:55.880
quickly returns int shiny,
smooth glass.

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:59.190
It makes mirrors and lamps and
grape jelly jars, even

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:01.740
eyeglasses and windows
for cars.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.120
There's so many things,
so many to choose.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:09.450
And yes, you can even make
bottles for juice.

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:12.550
So always recycle, said
crow with a smile.

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:15.710
And reduce what you use
every once in a while.

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:20.120
When you reach for that bottle
high up on the shelf, remember

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:25.300
away is just somewhere else.

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.930
There's so many choices,
said sweet little Lou.

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:32.180
But this here bottle, we're
going to reuse.

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:34.740
And they each put
a flower in it.

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:35.990
The end.

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:41.210
Yay!

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:42.640
All right.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:43.800
Let's play some more music.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.190
You guys ready for a song?

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:47.630
This one, you have to
repeat after me.

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:49.160
OK?

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.450
It goes--

Big kids, too.

00:16:25.046 --> 00:16:27.386
I like that dance you were
doing over there.

at your house?

don't embarrass them.

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:54.360
Do you separate it out,
like bottles and cans?

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.340
Or do you just put
it in one thing?

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:56.110
Yeah.

then they turn it into

then it gets turned into dirt.

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:13.320
Do kids know what that
is, composting?

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.950
It's when you take all
your food scraps, and

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:15.840
you put it in a bowl.

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:17.980
And then you put it in a
place in your garden,

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:20.370
and worms eat it.

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:24.410
And then the worms poop it out,
and it turns into dirt.

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:25.660
That's pretty cool.

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:32.162

Awesome.

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:52.720
Cool.

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:53.810
All right.

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:56.300
Well, we were going to just open
it up to any questions

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:58.790
for any Googlers, perhaps
if you have for

00:18:58.790 --> 00:18:59.820
us, about any subject.

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:03.110
It doesn't have to be about
worms and poop.

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:06.770
But it can also be about
that, if you want.

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:08.060

ahead and start it off.

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:08.930
MICHAEL FRANTI: OK, go ahead.

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:10.635
ANGELA PRIMAVERA: And for those
of you on the VC, you

00:19:10.635 --> 00:19:13.430
can add it to the Dory
at goto slash Franti.

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:17.730
Or anybody here can go ahead
and step up to the mic.

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:21.340
So you found an inspirational
way to use your voice to

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:22.850
connect with those around you.

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:25.765
Is there a message that you
have for some of our young

00:19:25.765 --> 00:19:28.400
children here about the
power of their voice?

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:32.130
MICHAEL FRANTI: Well, my message
to every kid here is

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:34.940
that all of us are different.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:38.680
And being different
is beautiful.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:43.450
When you look in your house at
something that's like a salad,

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:48.370
if you have tomatoes in there
and carrots and greens and

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:49.550
sprouts and--

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:52.400
what are kinds of things you
guys put in your salads?

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.860
What do you put in your
salad at home?

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:57.490
Avocado?

00:19:57.490 --> 00:19:58.740
I love avocado.

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:02.090
Tea?

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:02.650
JAY BOWMAN: Cheese.

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:03.290
MICHAEL FRANTI: Cheese.

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:03.610
Oh, yeah.

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:06.710
We love cheese.

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:08.760
What?

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:09.270
Fruits.

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.390
Yeah.

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:10.320
Yeah, fruits.

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:13.660
So the more things that are in
the salad, the more beautiful

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:15.640
and tasty the salad is.

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:17.490
And that's the same thing with
people in our world.

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:21.950
The more difference that we have
and the more diversity--

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:25.420
we call it-- that we respect
and love and honor and

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:28.100
cherish, the better
the world is.

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:31.410
So that's my message to kids,
same as to adults.

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:35.260
Be your authentic self.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:36.510
Live your truth.

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.190

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:43.340
MICHAEL FRANTI: Pizza.

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:45.780

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:47.030
You do?

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:01.370
AUDIENCE: What'd you say?

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:03.191
I didn't hear.

00:21:03.191 --> 00:21:04.441
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.165
MICHAEL FRANTI: Nice, nice.

00:21:08.165 --> 00:21:10.230
You put salad in the garbage
when it's done.

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:15.190
ANGELA PRIMAVERA: I'll go ahead
and ask another one.

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:15.630
MICHAEL FRANTI: OK, cool.

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:17.240
ANGELA PRIMAVERA: Feel free to
hop up on the mic there.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.400
We also have books for those of
you that would like to ask

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.240
a question of Michael.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.010
What is something you've learned
from fatherhood that

00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:26.650
you'd like to share with us?

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:28.280
MICHAEL FRANTI: That I'm
wrong most of the time.

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:35.360
Being a dad, you have to make
it up as you go along.

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:39.530
I have one son who's 25 and
another son who's 14.

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:42.240
And I was really young when
I had my first son.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:51.870
And so when you have a kid, your
first kid, your time--

00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:54.810
you have to do all the wonderful
things in life that

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:58.945
you do, like go to parties and
hang out at the beach and do

00:21:58.945 --> 00:21:59.900
all these things.

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:02.050
It gets eliminated.

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:04.760
And so you have the time
with your kids.

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:08.350
And then you have like just
that one hour or two hours

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:11.200
that you have for yourself
every day.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:15.560
And so what I did during that
time is I would take care of

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:19.190
my son all day and then
put him to sleep.

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:24.260
And he would go off with his mom
after that in the night.

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:27.820
And I'd go to work at night at
nightclubs in San Francisco.

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:29.860
But I'd have one or
two hours at home.

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:31.010
And I would just write.

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:34.270
I had these yellow legal pads
of paper that I would

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:35.850
write lyrics on.

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:39.400
And at first, I was like,
man, my time is gone.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.160
But then it really makes
you think about

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.910
what you want to do.

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:45.560
What's the most important
thing that you want to

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:46.680
do with your time?

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:48.190
And for me, it was writing.

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:54.230
And so it really helped me to
hone in on what I love and

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:59.590
what my passion is and to really
do my best during those

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:01.080
moments that I had.

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:04.970
And my mom was--

00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:07.140
she is an amazing woman.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:09.380
Mrs. Franti adopted me.

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:12.230
And she had three kids
of her own with my

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:13.640
father, Charles Franti.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.530
And they're Finnish Americans.

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:18.570
And they adopted myself and
another African American son.

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:23.240
So we grew up in this house,
a diverse household.

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.150
I have one sister
who's lesbian.

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:28.440
And it's a very mixed
household.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:34.060
And one time I asked my mom.

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:38.470
I said, what did you
do with us kids?

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:41.160
You worked as a school
teacher for 35 years.

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.770
Then you'd come home and
deal with us five kids.

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:45.890
And she said, every
day I'd come home.

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:50.240
And I had one expectation of all
of you, which is that when

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.430
you went out into our
neighborhood, you treated

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:55.040
everybody as good or better
than you wanted to

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.440
be treated at home.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:02.100
And she said, I tried to teach
all of you kids and treat all

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:06.930
of you kids exactly the same,
which meant that if one of us

00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:10.210
got a lollipop, then all
of us had to share it.

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:14.220
I'm just kidding.

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:17.630
I don't advise that
to any parent.

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:20.150
But she insisted that we
treat every kid in our

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:21.720
neighborhood the same.

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:25.560
And she said that the greatest
gift that any parent could

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:29.320
give their children is wings.

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:33.530
And the wings are the self
confidence you have, that when

00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:36.390
you're in whatever precipice
in your life, that you feel

00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:41.280
like I have the ability to
jump off and fly and face

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:44.380
whatever it is that this
challenge is in my life.

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:48.550
And so that's what I try to
do with both my sons.

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:51.970
And my mom did a really
great job with that,

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:54.850
I think, with me.

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:55.090
ANGELA PRIMAVERA: All right.

00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:56.770
We have a question from
the audience.

00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:57.270
MICHAEL FRANTI: Cool.

00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:57.770
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:24:57.770 --> 00:24:58.630
Thank you for coming out.

00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:59.470
And we really appreciate it.

00:24:59.470 --> 00:24:59.820
MICHAEL FRANTI: You're
welcome.

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:01.760
AUDIENCE: What's the story
behind you being barefoot?

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.480
And how often do you run into
a place where you think, no,

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.920
probably not going
to go there?

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:10.510
MICHAEL FRANTI: Well, man,
walking onto the Google

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:13.990
campus, I was like, ew, with a
name like Google, I don't know

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:15.550
if I even want to--

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:16.180
no.

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:17.270
I've been barefoot--

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:20.390
it'll be 13 years on my
birthday, which is at the end

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:21.410
of this month.

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:27.290
And I started walking barefoot
in countries where kids

00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:28.960
couldn't afford to wear shoes.

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:31.140
And I'd go out and I'd play
soccer with them and stuff.

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:35.480
And so I would take off my shoes
just to not stomp on

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:36.970
their feet or whatever.

00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:39.150
And I could barely
take three steps.

00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:40.890
I was like, ouch, ouch, ouch.

00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:42.210
So I decided to go home.

00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:45.040
And for three days, I was
going to go barefoot.

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.556
You have a question?

00:25:47.556 --> 00:25:49.492
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:49.492 --> 00:25:53.364
When did you learn guitar?

00:25:53.364 --> 00:25:54.830
AUDIENCE: When did
you learn guitar?

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:57.210
MICHAEL FRANTI: When
did I learn guitar?

00:25:57.210 --> 00:25:59.980
I learned guitar not
too long ago.

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:01.600
I've only been playing
guitar about seven or

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.450
eight years, actually.

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:04.220
Yeah.

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:06.080
I started really late.

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.450
I'll tell you more about
that in a minute.

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:12.620
But so I decided to go barefoot
for three days.

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:15.090
And three days turned into
a week and into a

00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:16.740
month and into a year.

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:22.810
And my son's waving
at me back there.

00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:26.020
He's like, dad, your
feet are gross.

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:31.150
And there are times when I feel
like, wow, it's really

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:31.750
gross around here.

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:34.380
But I'm just more observant
of where I step.

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:40.200
It's funny that you have to wear
shoes when you go into

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.280
the airport, and then you have
to take them off when you go

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:43.010
through the security.

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:44.670
And then you got to put
them back on again.

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:45.910
Then when you get on
the plane, you can

00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:46.590
take them off again.

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:49.630
So I always carry a pair of
flip-flops around that are for

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:51.490
those kind of moments.

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:55.820
And I never do it out of
any form of protest.

00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:58.030
If I'm somewhere, and they say,
please put your shoes on,

00:26:58.030 --> 00:27:00.720
I always put my flip-flops on.

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:04.470
And that's kind of the story.

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:06.680
And when it was the tenth
anniversary of me being

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:08.640
barefoot, I partnered with
this organization called

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.130
Soles4Souls.

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:13.850
And we collect used shoes
for kids and families

00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:15.820
all around the world.

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:18.230
It started after Hurricane
Katrina.

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:21.570
A lot of people left their
homes without shoes.

00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:25.310
And so they started collecting
shoes for that.

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:29.890
But now we're in Haiti, South
America, Africa, places in

00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:31.140
Asia, all over the world.

00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:37.080
Oh, so my guitar--

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:41.390
I went on this trip to this
place called Cuba.

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:45.150
And I was there with a group of
musicians from around the

00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:48.610
world who are collaborating
with Cuban artists.

00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:52.330
And we were there singing the
songs that we'd written

00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:54.800
together during a week.

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:58.120
And so every night, this guitar
would get passed around

00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:58.960
this table.

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:02.830
And everybody would sort of sing
these wonderful boleros

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:06.300
off into the Cuban Havana
moonlit night with bottles of

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:08.350
rum and cigars being
passed around.

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:15.690
And probably should lay off the
cigars and rum till you

00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:19.240
get your first chords
down, at least.

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:23.360
And so I decided, I'm never
going to be caught in this

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:25.320
situation when I can't
play guitar.

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.750
And so a year passed.

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:28.910
And I was at this great
festival up in Oregon.

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:31.160
And the same thing, the guitar
got passed to me.

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:33.060
And all I could do was go--

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:34.310
[MUSIC - THE SUGARHILL GANG,
"RAPPER'S DELIGHT"]

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.170
MICHAEL FRANTI: So I decided,
golly, I'm going

00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:41.960
to learn the guitar.

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:44.710
So finally, another
year passed.

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:46.580
And I was in another
embarrassing situation.

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:49.100
And I was up with a friend of
mine who's a farmer up in

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:50.350
Humboldt County.

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:57.060
And I decided this would be the
perfect place to sit on

00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:02.370
his porch for hours and learn
my first guitar chords.

00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:04.360
And I've been playing now about
seven, eight years.

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:05.870
And I love it.

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:07.120
Yeah.

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:09.590
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:10.940
Thanks again for coming here.

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:14.750
It is just terrific to have
people like you come visit us.

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:16.680
So you've had this
amazing career.

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:19.830
Musically, you've done an
incredible range of things,

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:23.270
and then outside of music, from
video stuff to writing

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:25.440
children's books to just
social projects.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.930
What are you most proud of?

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:29.770
And what do you think is going
to have the biggest legacy?

00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:32.930
MICHAEL FRANTI: Well,
it's the same thing,

00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:33.860
the two same things.

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:35.020
I'm most proud of my kids.

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:37.745
And hopefully, my kids have
the biggest legacy.

00:29:37.745 --> 00:29:38.000
Right?

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.250
High five, son.

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:44.800
There's a lot of things that
I've done in music.

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:49.010
And the most memorable things
are being in places where

00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:52.210
music is absent most of the
time and then going and

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:55.820
bringing music there and seeing
the environment change

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:56.795
immediately.

00:29:56.795 --> 00:30:00.670
AUDIENCE: You had such an
eclectic career from your

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:04.060
activism, social justice,
your films, to music.

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:06.920
What inspired you to jump
into children's

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:07.970
books of all things?

00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:12.170
And then I think what you
previously just said might

00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:13.010
explain that already.

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:13.290
But--

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:14.040
MICHAEL FRANTI: Yeah.

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:14.940
OK.

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:22.640
Well, my favorite artists
have been--

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:28.240
my favorite artists are Bob
Marley, Marvin Gaye, John

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.800
Lennon, and Johnny Cash.

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:33.310
And the reason is because they
both-- or all of them were

00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:36.970
able to write songs about how
much they wanted to see the

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:40.080
world be a better place.

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:43.870
And then they would also write
a song right next to it about

00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:46.950
how much they love
their girlfriend.

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:51.630
And I've always felt like if
you can't do both, or if

00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:54.620
you're only settled on just
doing one of those things,

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:59.500
then you're missing so much
of what it's about.

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:02.610
And so that's why I do
the different things.

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:07.380
That's why I go to Iraq and play
music on the street and

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:11.240
make a film about that and then
write a children's book,

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:13.860
like this book, the other book
that's here, "What I Be,"

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:16.720
which is about being yourself.

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.920
And really, the message
is the same thing.

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:23.930
It's about reaching out to other
people and being the

00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:26.820
person that you are and then
being able to embrace other

00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:32.620
people for being the person
that they are.

00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:35.930
And my mom used to always tell
me, it's not enough--

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:37.360
she hated the word tolerance.

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:38.830
That was a buzz word.

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:39.980
We need to have tolerance.

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:42.060
And there's a Museum of
Tolerance, which is a

00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:43.350
fantastic place.

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:46.540
But she never liked the
word tolerance,

00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:48.370
because it was always--

00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:53.300
you tolerate getting your teeth
grinded at the dentist.

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:58.240
But she liked the words like
embrace and to honor and to

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:01.790
respect and cherish because
she's always felt like we

00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:05.400
should be that towards other
people, towards other

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:10.540
cultures, other walks of life,
that to really live life and

00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:14.210
to live a fullness for yourself
is to find the beauty

00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:17.200
in other things that are
different than you.

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:17.700
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:19.200
MICHAEL FRANTI: Yeah.

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:20.700
ANGELA PRIMAVERA: Go ahead.

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:22.600
AUDIENCE: Did you do
any Johnny Cash

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:25.710
songs at San Quentin?

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:29.575
"Folsom Prison," or
"Cocaine Blues?"

00:32:29.575 --> 00:32:30.240
MICHAEL FRANTI: It was funny.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:33.270
Before we-- we also played
in Folsom Prison.

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:33.670
AUDIENCE: Oh, wow.

00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:34.930
MICHAEL FRANTI: And we were
the first artists playing

00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:37.960
there in 37 years since Johnny
Cash had done it.

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:43.800
And when we went in, the warden
of the prison required

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:46.530
that I send a list of the songs
that I was going to sing

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:48.960
and all the lyrics.

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:53.740
And he went through line item,
veto style, and said, you

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:54.510
can't sing this line.

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:55.550
You can't sing this line.

00:32:55.550 --> 00:32:56.660
And you can't sing this song.

00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:57.910
And you can't sing this song.

00:32:57.910 --> 00:33:02.450
And at first, I was like,
man, this is not cool.

00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:04.050
I'm not going to do this.

00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:09.270
I got a pride feather
sticking out of me.

00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:11.560
And then I thought, these
cats are locked

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.010
down for a long time.

00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:17.930
And who am I to not sing or not
show up because the warden

00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:19.450
won't let me sing a song?

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:22.823
This is not the protest
that I want to make.

00:33:22.823 --> 00:33:25.480
So the answer to your question,
no, we weren't

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:25.950
allowed to.

00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:26.675
And no, I didn't

00:33:26.675 --> 00:33:27.810
AUDIENCE: Oh, wow.

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:29.910
Just Sesame Street.

00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:32.100
MICHAEL FRANTI: Well, there's
plenty of other

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:34.120
songs besides that.

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:37.350
But that's what--

00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:42.480
one of the things that we come
across as musicians is where

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:43.860
are our values?

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:46.250
And what are the lines that
we choose to cross?

00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:48.760
Are we going to put a
song in this movie?

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.570
And if we put a song in the
movie, are we going to put a

00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:52.770
song in the commercial that
goes along with the movie?

00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:56.560
And then if that commercial also
has a partnership with

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:58.670
some brand, do we support
that brand?

00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:01.640
Do we allow the song
to be in there?

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:05.080
And at the end of the day, I
always feel like I'm out there

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:08.995
every day of my life on tour,
singing things and expressing

00:34:08.995 --> 00:34:11.830
the things I can in the best
way I can for whatever the

00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:13.310
situation is.

00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:17.239
But I'll talk to these kids
differently than I would kids

00:34:17.239 --> 00:34:20.659
in San Quentin.

00:34:20.659 --> 00:34:23.239
AUDIENCE: What I really want to
ask though was about, when

00:34:23.239 --> 00:34:25.199
you were a kid, what was
your favorable books?

00:34:25.199 --> 00:34:26.480
Or do your kids have
any favorite?

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:27.520
MICHAEL FRANTI: Oh, yeah.

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:30.340
My favorite books were the
"Curious George" books.

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:30.875
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:34:30.875 --> 00:34:32.030
MICHAEL FRANTI: Yeah.

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:36.830
And "Harold and the Purple
Crayon." And then all of the

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:42.940
Roald Dahl books, and especially
"Willy Wonka and

00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:44.250
the Chocolate Facotory."

00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:45.440
AUDIENCE: What about music
when you were young?

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:46.804
What was the first
stuff that you

00:34:46.804 --> 00:34:47.929
listened to and then after?

00:34:47.929 --> 00:34:49.889
MICHAEL FRANTI: The first stuff
that I listened to was

00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:52.360
music that was in my house that
my brothers and sisters

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:53.040
were playing.

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:59.440
So it was Al Green, Jim
Croce, Carole King.

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:02.240
And then it was The Clash and

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:05.290
Parliament-Funkadelic and The Police.

00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:08.250
And then it became Run-DMC.

00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:10.490
Somewhere in all of that was
the "Saturday Night Fever"

00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:14.600
soundtrack which didn't leave
the turntable for a long time.

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:15.880
Earth, Wind &amp; Fire.

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:19.610
And then once I went through
all that stuff, I went

00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:23.730
straight into hardcore punk rock
for many years and just

00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:29.000
listen exclusively to all the
great Bay Area bands, Dead

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.320
Kennedys and the Circle Jerks
and all the bands that were

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:36.450
touring through here.

00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:36.710
ANGELA PRIMAVERA: All right.

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:38.440
We'll take one more
from the audience.

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:38.890
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:40.640
I want to say, thanks
for coming.

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:41.750
Your message that
you're sending--

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:42.610
it's really positive.

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:44.080
And you're doing a great
job inspiring

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:45.410
children as well as adults.

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:46.010
MICHAEL FRANTI: Thank you.

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:48.390
AUDIENCE: I'm also an aspiring
writer myself.

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:51.430
My question goes out to--

00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:53.140
it's for adults but
also for children.

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:55.710
Can you give us words and
advice in overcoming a

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:59.140
challenging situation or whether
it's music, writing,

00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:01.780
or just in life in general?

00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:09.520
MICHAEL FRANTI: Well, I think
that if you get yourself out

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:14.290
of your comfort zone a lot of
the time, then it becomes more

00:36:14.290 --> 00:36:18.150
familiar crossing over those
lines where you don't feel

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:21.000
comfortable or where
you feel scared.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.300
I practice yoga.

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:25.840
And in our practice of yoga,
we put ourselves into

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:26.990
uncomfortable positions.

00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:29.530
And we learn how to breathe
while we're going through

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:32.400
these really intense
stretches.

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:38.210
And to quiet our mind and say,
I'm not going to listen to

00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:40.660
this voice that's saying I'm
not good enough or I'm not

00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:44.140
limber enough or I'm too
tired or whatever--

00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:48.140
and we practice the exercise
so that when we get into

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:50.820
uncomfortable situations in
our day to day life, they

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:52.260
become easier.

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:55.390
And they're still not.

00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:57.710
It's still always hard.

00:36:57.710 --> 00:37:03.340
But writing a book is something
that I never

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:05.000
imagined I would do.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.150
But I made a five year
plan at one point.

00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:09.710
And I said, there's a few things
that I want to do.

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:11.080
I want to write a book.

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:13.090
I want to make a film.

00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:16.570
I want to start a yoga school.

00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:22.540
And I wanted to get my band
to a certain level of

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:26.440
musicianship and get ourselves
out touring at a certain level

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:27.940
and had goals in that regard.

00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:31.270
And just to write them down,
those goals, was really

00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:32.620
helpful for me.

00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:37.150
And then I said, I'm not going
to prioritize them in terms of

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:39.010
what's most important, because
they're all really

00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:40.280
important to me.

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:42.970
But I prioritized
them in terms of

00:37:42.970 --> 00:37:44.520
what was most imminent.

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.870
So in order to become a better
musician, I needed to take

00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:47.750
guitar lessons.

00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:51.060
So that became in the A pile.

00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:53.010
And then there was the
B pile of things and

00:37:53.010 --> 00:37:53.980
the C pile of things.

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:58.610
So writing stuff down and then
creating a priority of--

00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:00.150
I need to-- if I'm going
to write a book, I

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:02.500
got to do this first.

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:04.160
And then I got to find the
illustrator second.

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:06.430
Then I got to figure out
a way to publish it.

00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:06.890
AUDIENCE: Nice.

00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:07.700
Thank you.

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:08.846
MICHAEL FRANTI: You're
welcome.

00:38:08.846 --> 00:38:09.230
ANGELA PRIMAVERA: All right.

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:10.890
You got another song for us?

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:11.263
MICHAEL FRANTI: I do.

00:38:11.263 --> 00:38:12.010
Yup.

00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:12.280

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:14.680

00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:15.730
MICHAEL FRANTI: All right.

00:38:15.730 --> 00:38:17.976
Let's do [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:17.976 --> 00:38:19.290
JAY BOWMAN: OK.

00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:21.150
MICHAEL FRANTI: So we need
some kids up here.

00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:22.330
We need some kids up
here to dance.

00:38:22.330 --> 00:38:24.100
Come on up.

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:25.350

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:34.460
OK.
