00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.920
[Singing]

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.780
I grew up in a little Baptist Church
called Mills Chapel Baptist Church and

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.980
it was right beside the house that I
grew up in, so I tell everybody, every

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.280
time the church doors opened, I was there
because there was nothing else to do

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.060
but go to church.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.020
Dr. Jill Hamilton has come a long
way as a nursing professor and researcher,

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.620
but her heart has never strayed far 
from Black Mountain, North Carolina,

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.360
where the grandmother who raised her with church and song championed her ambition to go to college.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.760
"My grandmother used to always say to me,

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.910
'I couldn't go, but you gonna go.' She'd
always brag on me, and you know she was

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:04.049
always encouraging, and so I think what
motivates me now to really do what I do,

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.390
do the research that I ] do, do the nursing
care that I do for the population is

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.060
because I used to always say, 'I want to
do something to give back to people like my grandmama.'

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:24.180
So my passion even today is with the 
care of older and African Americans.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.080
Because when I give back to
them, I'm giving back to my grandmama."

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.630
Hamilton's most recent study intends to
demonstrate that positive health

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.950
outcomes for African Americans with
serious diseases like cancer can be

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.259
buoyed by religious comforts like
favorite songs or Bible verses.

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.540
"When a patient first comes in, part of the
assessment should be, 'Do you have a song

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:55.439
or Bible verse that you use when you are
stressed, when you're worried, when you're

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:03.110
nervous, when you're anxious?' and we
should document that in the chart."

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.069
Hamilton has amassed a database of
several dozen, recordings showing people

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.590
reciting a prayer, Bible verse, or singing
a song of comfort. She plans on sharing

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.330
the scenes with willing patients as part
of a forthcoming study that will try and

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.360
find out to what degree this type of
spiritual therapy can aid the healing process.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.400
But when Hamilton began her work conventional wisdom was not on her side.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.970
"They said, 'What else was published?'
and I would say, 'Well, we're gonna change that!'

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.459
But at the time this was like in
1997, when I first started doing my

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:44.220
dissertation research, and it was
absolutely forbidden just to talk about

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:53.280
God in healthcare. I was told, 'No, you can't
do that,' but I kept doing it anyway

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.480
because that's what people that
was what was important to the population.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:06.959
We think of social support coming from a
spouse, from a friend, from a family member,

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.220
and yes, African Americans have that also, but

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.840
for African Americans, and I'm sure for
other racial ethnic groups as well,

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.549
but particularly for older African Americans,
they have come to rely on God as a

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.389
source of support, and you can't ignore
that,  you can't separate it, because

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:32.160
God is as real in their network of support as any
other close relative that we can actually see."

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.650
Cory Woodyatt is a student of Hamilton's
who got the notion to try out her approach

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.970
during one of his clinical rotations.
"The ER was busy. There was a lot of people,

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.810
there was a long line up for folks to
get in and we received a new patient

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.519
who came into the main ED with his wife."

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.079
The patient was impaired and agitated, and so it was
difficult for the medical staff to help him.

00:03:55.079 --> 00:04:00.569
"He was getting a lot more anxious
and he was shaking and he was trying to

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.470
get out of the bed, and he was getting
more confused, so I pulled out my cell

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:11.880
phone and I put on 'Amazing Grace.'  The moment that the song came on he calmed right down."

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.940
"Perceptions have changed about spirituality
and now we realize

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.640
that is a very important part of health care.
