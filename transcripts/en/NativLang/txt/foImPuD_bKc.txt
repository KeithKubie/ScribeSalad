Speaker 1:          00:00          It turns out that in some languages out there, people sing when they speak. So how does that work?

Speaker 2:          00:07          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10          When you think of the sounds that you put together to make a word, vowels and consonants come to mind, and that's good usually. But to build words in tonal languages like a house or Mandarin, you need another set of musical pieces called tones to make meaning. Yes. These languages pay attention to higher and lower notes like a singer or a musician would. They don't do this by requiring their speakers to have perfect pitch and hit the same notes as everyone else every time. Not everyone who speaks your language will be a metal soprano after all. So if it's not about the specific notes, how do tonal languages use so many tones? They pay attention to changes in pitch. A syllable sung higher hot can mean something different than that same syllable. Sun Lower are linguistically. We would count these as two different tones, whether you're high, low or just right in the middle, you're contrasting steady notes.

Speaker 1:          01:07          These different pitches are called register tones in the band, two languages of Africa and Athabaskan languages like Navajo. The two basic register tones are a high tone and a low tone. Changes in pitch can get more dynamic, rising, falling, bouncing, or staying level like they do in mandarin or Vietnamese. These tones are more about the shape of the tone, not simply whether the note stays high or lower, so they're called contour tones. In Mandarin, a syllable can be pronounced in four different contour tones. In Tai, there are five contour tones. Think you've mastered register versus contour tones. Well then combine them. Mandarin may have four contrary tones, but look to the south to see how Cantonese distinguishes a low rising tone from a medium rising tone. Oh, and it also has a high level tone, which is different from a medium level tone and a low level tone.

Speaker 1:          02:03          Add in that low falling tone and you've got six ways to sing a Cantonese syllable. Notice that both register and contoured tones are some on valves. Continents have your tongue blocking, smacking. We're pushing the airflow around. Unlike this smooth vibrating air characteristic of valves, which makes them the perfect environment for sing song. Eat tones. Tones are an extra feature that tonal languages use to build words. Rising level and falling are as distinct as PT and k. So speaking of word in the wrong tone in one of these languages can sound as bad as putting a keyword doesn't belong. This makes tonality in the tutorial. A really difficult feature to pick up for people coming from a non tonal language like English, much sympathy my friend. So keep your ears alert and practice, practice, practice. Thanks again for learning with me and subscribed for language.
