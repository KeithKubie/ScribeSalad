00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.300
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:12.170
&gt;&gt; An introduction to the
IQ Five Battery Analyzer.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.470
&gt;&gt; KEVIN WATSON: Hi.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.130
I'm Kevin Watson and I'm the
equipment repair officer here

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.730
at NLS in Washington, DC.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.360
This video is an introduction to
using the iQ5 Battery Analyzer.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.760
NLS provides the IQ Five Battery
Analyzer to the repair network

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.210
for testing and analyzing
Talking Book Machine Batteries.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.370
All batteries, whether from a
machine returned from a patron

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.570
or from new stock, should
be tested before re-using.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.150 position:56%
Before we start analyzing batteries,
I want to show you how to set

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.660
up the IQ5 so that
it is ready to use.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.080 position:56%
To set up your iQ5 Battery Analyzer,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.910
you will need a flat blade
screwdriver and 6 DTB Adapters.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.080
The DTB adapters are
available from NLS.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.960
You can order them using the WOW
system, under stock number ITECH C.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.620
If you are going to be
analyzing C-1 batteries,

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.940
you can order the C-1 adapters
from the WOW system too,

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.940
stock number iTech B. Remove
your analyzer from the box.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.320
Note that the iQ5 is
cooled by a fan in the back

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.490
so be sure you leave enough
room behind it to circulate air.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.740
Your iQ5 comes equipped with a
power button, a printer port,

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.550
six adapter slots,
and a display screen

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.750
and three buttons for each slot.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.060
&gt;&gt; Set Up

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.500 position:56%
&gt;&gt; KEVIN WATSON: To set up your iQ5,

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.210
you will need to remove the slot
covers and install the adapters

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.660
for each slot you plan to use.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.740
You should not plug the unit in
until all adapters are installed.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.300
Remove the cover on the first
slot using the screwdriver.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.860
Be sure to keep all covers you
remove nearby because you will have

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.630
to put them back on
each slot not in use.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.610
Never install or uninstall adapters
while the unit is plugged in.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.850
Note that the connection of the far
left is positioned a bit different

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.190
from the others.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.480
You should always connect
the adapters beginning

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.020
from the far right before
connecting the others.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.730
Only remove the covers of slots
you plan to attach an adapter to.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.740
Connect the adapter to
the slot connection.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.130
Repeat this effort for each
slot you plan to use until all

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.650
of the covers are removed
and adapters connected.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.010
Make sure the power button is
OFF, then plug in your iQ5.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.880
Turn the power ON.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.060
Note that you do not need to turn
your iQ5 off unless you are going

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.910
to install or uninstall an adapter.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.680
Now that all of your adapters are
attached and your iQ5 is plugged in

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.090
and powered up, we are ready
to begin testing batteries.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.900
To demonstrate the iQ5 I'm going
to make use of several boxes.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.460
This is just one way you
can organize your battery

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.480
testing operation.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.220
Here I have four boxes.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:14.340
I've labeled them: Pass,
Test, Fail, and Condition.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.250
When a player is returned
from a patron,

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.370
you should remove the battery
and place it in the Test box.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.130 position:56%
You should take a known-good battery
and install it in the player.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.510
As you test your batteries using
the iQ5, you should pull one

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.470
from the Test box and then
put it in the Pass, Fail,

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.920
or Condition box depending
on the results of the test.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.710
The iQ5 has five modes:
Charge, Discharge,

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:47.590
Cycle Test, Analyze, Condition.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.100
Charge. Charges a battery
and sets it to trickle,

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.050
which is a holding charge.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.350
Discharge.

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.830
Discharges a battery to
test, charges the battery,

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.800
and then sets it to trickle.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.160
Analyze. Charges, discharges
to test, recharges,

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.260
and then sets the battery
to trickle.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.730
Condition.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.880
Charges and discharges to
test a battery three times

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.520
and then sets it to trickle.

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.430
Cycle Test.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.330
Charges and discharges to test.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.120
This loop has to be manually
stopped by removing the battery.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:37.050
&gt;&gt; Charging Mode, Discharging
Mode, and Cycle Test Mode.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.350 position:56%
&gt;&gt; KEVIN WATSON: Generally speaking,

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.310
repair staff will not be using
the Charging, Discharging,

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.460
or Cycle Test modes on the iQ5.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.510
When you attach a battery to the
iQ5, it will automatically go

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.260
into Charging mode unless
you select another option.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.060
Using the iQ5 for charging
batteries is not recommended.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.680
A digital talking book player will
charge a battery in half the time.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.940
If you only need to charge a
battery, use a player instead

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.580
to keep the slots on
your iQ5 available

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.410
for testing or conditioning.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:16.030
Discharging and Cycle test modes
are advanced functions of the iQ5

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.040
that we will not be
covering in this video.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.850
&gt;&gt; Analyze Mode - Used Batteries

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.770
&gt;&gt; KEVIN WATSON: Analyze mode will
be the most used mode on your iQ5.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.620
To analyze a battery that
has been out in the field,

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.140
connect it to the adapter,
and push the Analyze button.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:41.320
In my demonstration, I'm going to
take 6 batteries from my Test box,

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.990
attach them to the iQ5 adapters,

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.530
and push the Analyze
button on each display.

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.140
The iQ5 will take several
hours to analyze a battery,

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.390
so you can leave and come back.

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:58.960
When you return to your iQ5, check
the display panel for the results.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:04.500
The lowest acceptable level for
battery analysis is 650 mAh,

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.010
which is equivalent to
16 hours of playtime

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.960
in a digital talking book player.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:16.050
If you get a reading of 650 mAh
or higher, remove that battery

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:20.540
from the iQ5 and place it
in the box marked Pass.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.760
If you get a reading of 649 mAh
or below, remove that battery

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:30.110
from the iQ5 and place it
in the box marked Fail.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:34.240
Remember, this is for batteries
that have been out in the field.

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:40.730
&gt;&gt; Analyze Mode - Unused Batteries

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:42.030
&gt;&gt; KEVIN WATSON: Now
we are going to talk

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.190
about analyzing unused batteries.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.890
To keep your operation
as efficient as possible,

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:51.360
you should analyze a sample from
every box of unused batteries.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.810
Remove six unused batteries
from the box.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:58.730
Connect each of them
to a slot on the iQ5.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:02.060
Push the Analyze button
on each display.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.770
Leave the iQ5 to do the
analyzing and come back later.

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:10.610
When you return, read the
results on each display.

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.700
For practical purposes, we
should set the acceptable limit

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:18.510
for unused batteries at
1000 mAh, which translates

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:22.890 position:56%
to 24 hours of playtime on the DTBM.

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:27.020
Remove batteries that return a
reading of 1000 mAh or better

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:32.250
from the iQ5 and place them
in the box marked Pass.

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:35.600
If any of the batteries in the test
sample return a reading of less

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.610
than 1000 mAhs, you should
remove them and place them

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:42.400
in the box labeled Condition.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.310
It's a good idea to analyze the
entire box of unused batteries

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:51.670
if any in your sample yield
results lower than 1000 mAh to weed

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:55.190
out any defective batteries.

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:58.130
&gt;&gt; Conditioning Mode

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:00.820 position:56%
&gt;&gt; KEVIN WATSON: Conditioning unused
batteries will either bring them

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:06.550
up to acceptable levels or it
will detect if they are defective.

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:10.020
To condition batteries,
attach them to the slots

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:13.740
and press the Condition
button on each display.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:18.190
Conditioning mode goes through
three charge and discharge cycles.

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:20.460
It may take a while to
run through the cycles.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.600
So, once you press
the condition button,

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.140
you can leave and come back later.

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:28.290
When you return, read the
results on each display.

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:33.290
Again we are looking
for 1000 mAh or better.

00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:37.180
Batteries that show 1000
mAh or better on the display

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:40.750
when the conditioning cycle
is complete, can be removed

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:43.700
and placed in the box labeled Pass.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.760
When the conditioning cycle is
complete, you should run batteries

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:52.610
that read less than 1000 mAhs
through a second condition cycle

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:55.570
by pressing the condition button.

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:59.100
Again, this will take some time,
so come back and check on it later.

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:03.600
After a second conditioning cycle,
if your batteries are still reading

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:08.060
under 1000 mAh, it's safe
to say they are defective.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.720
They should be removed
from the iQ5 and placed

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.910 position:56%
in the Fail box for proper disposal.

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:18.240
This concludes the introduction
to the iQ5 Battery Analyzer.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.690
Remember that we are a service
oriented operation and it's

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:26.210
up to you to make sure that
DTBM batteries are functioning

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:30.260
at an acceptable level when the
players are delivered to patrons.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.870
If you have problems or questions

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:37.590
about using the iQ5 Battery
Analyzer, please contact me,
