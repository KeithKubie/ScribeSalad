00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.448
(drum beats)

00:00:01.448 --> 00:00:02.281
- [Nathan] Sue Stanford
(slow guitar tune)

00:00:02.281 --> 00:00:04.444
is one of over six
thousand licensed realtors

00:00:04.444 --> 00:00:05.767
in L.A. County.

00:00:05.767 --> 00:00:08.275
And in an over-saturated
market, it can be hard

00:00:08.275 --> 00:00:09.905
to stand out from the crowd.

00:00:09.905 --> 00:00:14.130
- We're continually trying
to outdo the other (laughs)

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.875
person you know trying to get business.

00:00:15.875 --> 00:00:18.554
- So I paid her a visit to
help her become one of the most

00:00:18.554 --> 00:00:20.812
sought after realtors in the city.

00:00:20.812 --> 00:00:24.419
So, I always like to
begin with some small talk

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:27.771
to break the ice and make
the other person comfortable.

00:00:27.771 --> 00:00:29.165
- Okay

00:00:29.165 --> 00:00:33.165
- Um, have you ever posed
for a painting before?

00:00:34.585 --> 00:00:38.124
- No, not actually, have
not for anything like that.

00:00:38.124 --> 00:00:40.115
- You'd make a good model,
you're very beautiful.

00:00:40.115 --> 00:00:42.722
- Well bless your heart, thank
you so much for saying that.

00:00:42.722 --> 00:00:44.893
- You're welcome.

00:00:44.893 --> 00:00:48.879
So is that enough small talk
to make you comfortable?

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:50.796
- Yeah, I guess so, um?

00:00:52.392 --> 00:00:55.829
- My mission was to make Sue
one of L.A.'s top realtors.

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.309
The plan, have her specialize
in a currently unrepresented

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.857
group of home buyer.

00:01:00.857 --> 00:01:04.330
The 50% of people who believe in ghosts.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.602
- Ghosts?

00:01:05.602 --> 00:01:09.035
- When you show a house, half
the people that come through

00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:11.864
are thinking, is there a ghost in here?

00:01:11.864 --> 00:01:12.790
- Okay.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.744
- So it surprised me that
I've never seen a realtor

00:01:14.744 --> 00:01:17.985
that can guarantee that
all the homes they sell,

00:01:17.985 --> 00:01:20.291
are entirely ghost free.

00:01:20.291 --> 00:01:21.804
- True, yeah.

00:01:21.804 --> 00:01:24.890
- So what I'm suggesting is
a complete rebranding of you,

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.965
as the ghost realtor.

00:01:26.965 --> 00:01:30.507
(Sue breaths in heavily)
(chuckles)

00:01:30.507 --> 00:01:32.179
- It's really a wild idea.

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:34.213
- Sue wasn't fully seeing my vision yet.

00:01:34.213 --> 00:01:37.273
So to help sell it to her, I
mocked up some new branding,

00:01:37.273 --> 00:01:40.130
and prepared a special
surprise to get her excited.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.546
Ready?
- Uh huh.

00:01:41.546 --> 00:01:43.004
- Alright, open your eyes!

00:01:43.004 --> 00:01:44.462
Look!

00:01:44.462 --> 00:01:45.545
- Oh my gosh!

00:01:46.668 --> 00:01:48.660
That's amazing.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.620
- Pretty great, huh?

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.200
- That's me!

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.506
My homes are 100% ghost and demon free!

00:01:55.506 --> 00:01:56.699
Oh my goodness!

00:01:56.699 --> 00:01:58.573
- [Nathan] I could tell Sue was
thrilled with her new image.

00:01:58.573 --> 00:02:00.934
But to fully rebrand as the Ghost Realtor,

00:02:00.934 --> 00:02:03.460
she'd need to work with the
professional psychic medium

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.685
who could verify whether her
homes were truly ghost free.

00:02:06.685 --> 00:02:08.973
So I found a local psychic online.

00:02:08.973 --> 00:02:11.716
- Hello, I'm psychic Ron Bard.

00:02:11.716 --> 00:02:13.256
- [Nathan] And arranged
for he and Sue to meet at

00:02:13.256 --> 00:02:14.555
one of her listings.

00:02:14.555 --> 00:02:17.424
- My mother was considered
queen of the psychics by

00:02:17.424 --> 00:02:21.353
Dr. Hans Holzer, he's written 145 books.

00:02:21.353 --> 00:02:22.349
- Wow.

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.403
- And my daughter just found
her first missing child

00:02:25.403 --> 00:02:27.113
in New York.

00:02:27.113 --> 00:02:27.946
- Okay.

00:02:27.946 --> 00:02:31.307
So just to be clear, if
there's a ghost in this house,

00:02:31.307 --> 00:02:32.535
you'll be able to tell.

00:02:32.535 --> 00:02:33.618
- That's correct.

00:02:33.618 --> 00:02:36.013
- With Ron's guarantee,
I introduced him to Sue.

00:02:36.013 --> 00:02:37.562
- My great pleasure.

00:02:37.562 --> 00:02:40.182
- And then we followed as he
lead us through the house,

00:02:40.182 --> 00:02:43.392
inspecting each room for
the presence of any ghosts.

00:02:43.392 --> 00:02:46.053
- Definitely a change of
energies, you feel that correct?

00:02:46.053 --> 00:02:48.301
- Mm hmm, definitely, I feel
like chills are coming down

00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:49.884
my spine.

00:02:49.884 --> 00:02:50.887
- Is it a ghost?

00:02:50.887 --> 00:02:51.793
- No.

00:02:51.793 --> 00:02:53.347
- Things were off to a great start,

00:02:53.347 --> 00:02:56.579
as Ron believed the first house
was completely ghost free.

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:59.711
- I'm not feeling there's
any entities in this house.

00:02:59.711 --> 00:03:00.943
- Well that's good!
- That's good!

00:03:00.943 --> 00:03:02.144
- Yes!
- I can sell the house!

00:03:02.144 --> 00:03:03.293
- Yeah (laughs)!
- Yeah.

00:03:03.293 --> 00:03:05.729
- But when we visited another
one of Sue's listings,

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:07.844
Ron felt a presence immediately.

00:03:07.844 --> 00:03:10.484
- A man is screaming, you
know, arguing throughout

00:03:10.484 --> 00:03:11.317
the house.

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:13.569
- Screaming and arguing?

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.448
- Yeah, this is no good.

00:03:15.448 --> 00:03:17.401
- Oh dear.
- The bathroom?

00:03:17.401 --> 00:03:19.990
- This whole house, something's wrong.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:21.016
- Wow.

00:03:21.016 --> 00:03:23.412
- Ron sensed evil all around us.

00:03:23.412 --> 00:03:25.319
- Something went on back there.

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.087
- But it wasn't until
we went into the bedroom

00:03:27.087 --> 00:03:29.582
that he felt the true
presence of the ghost.

00:03:29.582 --> 00:03:31.493
- Do you feel like
there's ghosts around, or?

00:03:31.493 --> 00:03:32.326
- Yeah.

00:03:33.584 --> 00:03:35.204
- Ooh, Is that right?

00:03:35.204 --> 00:03:36.940
- I feel there are entities in this house.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:37.824
- I see.

00:03:37.824 --> 00:03:39.990
- There's no question about it.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.370
- Well that sucks for you.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.725
- Yeah, yeah.

00:03:43.725 --> 00:03:47.205
- What is his activity in the house?

00:03:47.205 --> 00:03:48.692
- It's like evil.

00:03:48.692 --> 00:03:50.949
It's like, you know what an incubus is?

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:55.010
It's a ghost that will have sex
with someone until they die.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.999
(Sue gasps)

00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:59.337
- Wow, that's like what I
experienced when I was in

00:03:59.337 --> 00:04:00.519
Switzerland.

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.163
Something, a bad spirit or a bad entity.

00:04:04.163 --> 00:04:06.760
- This is a room that
it's generating from.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.043
- What happened in Switzerland?

00:04:08.043 --> 00:04:09.957
- When I was being choked.

00:04:09.957 --> 00:04:11.471
- You were being choked in Switzerland?

00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:12.304
- Yeah.
- We were just talking

00:04:12.304 --> 00:04:13.345
about that.
- What?

00:04:13.345 --> 00:04:15.452
- Earlier we were.
- Choked by what?

00:04:15.452 --> 00:04:18.072
- By an entity like that, I
felt like I was being picked,

00:04:18.072 --> 00:04:20.313
- Wait, a ghost choked you in Switzerland?

00:04:20.313 --> 00:04:21.422
- Yes!

00:04:21.422 --> 00:04:22.424
- Wow!

00:04:22.424 --> 00:04:25.642
- Oh yes, there's been many
things that has happened

00:04:25.642 --> 00:04:26.475
in my life.

00:04:26.475 --> 00:04:28.442
That's why it's such
interesting to meet you.

00:04:28.442 --> 00:04:29.540
(gloomy music)
- Sue's bombshell

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.980
about the Switzerland ghost

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.253
made me feel an urgency
to get rid of this entity

00:04:33.253 --> 00:04:34.395
right way.

00:04:34.395 --> 00:04:35.962
The only question was how?

00:04:35.962 --> 00:04:37.592
- Could always be cleaned.

00:04:37.592 --> 00:04:39.271
- Ron suggested an exorcism.

00:04:39.271 --> 00:04:41.988
So the next morning I found
an exorcist from Fresno

00:04:41.988 --> 00:04:43.469
named Brother Carlos.

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:44.586
- You have to obey me.

00:04:44.586 --> 00:04:48.634
You have to come out in the
name of Jesus Christ, devils!

00:04:48.634 --> 00:04:51.078
- And booked him to do an
exorcism in the master bedroom

00:04:51.078 --> 00:04:52.294
for the following week.

00:04:52.294 --> 00:04:53.358
(synthesized flash)
(slow guitar music)

00:04:53.358 --> 00:04:55.698
In the meantime, Sue had an
appointment to show the house,

00:04:55.698 --> 00:04:57.447
that she preferred not to cancel.

00:04:57.447 --> 00:05:00.156
So before the potential
buyer arrived, I reminded her

00:05:00.156 --> 00:05:02.602
to be upfront about
the status of the home.

00:05:02.602 --> 00:05:05.144
You just have to be honest
with the person you're

00:05:05.144 --> 00:05:06.477
showing it to.

00:05:06.477 --> 00:05:09.224
And let them know that even
though there is an entity,

00:05:09.224 --> 00:05:12.012
we will be doing an exorcism
very soon, and that will

00:05:12.012 --> 00:05:13.220
get rid of it.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.919
- That's yes, okay, that sounds perfect.

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:17.449
- Okay, great, so good luck!

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:19.328
- Okay, thank you so much.

00:05:19.328 --> 00:05:20.278
- Thanks.

00:05:20.278 --> 00:05:21.111
(Nathan and Sue kiss)
(bright piano music)

00:05:21.111 --> 00:05:23.408
And moments later, Sue
began her first showing

00:05:23.408 --> 00:05:24.643
as the Ghost Realtor.

00:05:24.643 --> 00:05:27.335
- So the dining room's this
way and then the kitchen's

00:05:27.335 --> 00:05:28.599
to your right.

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:30.657
- [Nathan] After the potential
buyer made her way through

00:05:30.657 --> 00:05:32.982
the house, it was up to
Sue to close the deal.

00:05:32.982 --> 00:05:34.131
- So what did you think?

00:05:34.131 --> 00:05:35.106
- I like it!

00:05:35.106 --> 00:05:36.649
Especially the walk-in closet.

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:38.262
- Oh, a nice big one!

00:05:38.262 --> 00:05:39.095
- Yes!

00:05:39.095 --> 00:05:40.307
It's a nice big closet.

00:05:40.307 --> 00:05:42.592
And the master bedroom is really nice.

00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:44.434
- Yes.
- I like it, yes.

00:05:44.434 --> 00:05:45.267
- Wonderful.

00:05:45.267 --> 00:05:48.392
Well I do have to
explain something to you.

00:05:48.392 --> 00:05:50.568
Um, upstairs in the mater bedroom,

00:05:50.568 --> 00:05:54.651
we did find an entity,
and um, it was an incubus.

00:05:56.079 --> 00:05:57.565
I know you're wondering what that is.

00:05:57.565 --> 00:05:59.777
- I have no idea (laughs).
- Yeah, yeah.

00:05:59.777 --> 00:06:02.620
Well that is a pretty
evil spirit actually.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.953
And he said that the spirit rapes women,

00:06:08.126 --> 00:06:11.701
and has sex with them until they die.

00:06:11.701 --> 00:06:14.111
I know it sounds awful
but we're going to have it

00:06:14.111 --> 00:06:15.470
taken care of.

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.827
We're going to have an exorcist
come in and get rid of it.

00:06:18.827 --> 00:06:20.340
- This is real, really, like?

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.888
(laughs uncomfortably)
- I know.

00:06:21.888 --> 00:06:24.200
I know, isn't that unbelievable

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.775
that things like this
happen in this world.

00:06:26.775 --> 00:06:28.016
So trust me!

00:06:28.016 --> 00:06:30.531
Come back in a couple
of days and you'll see,

00:06:30.531 --> 00:06:32.308
it's a big difference.

00:06:32.308 --> 00:06:33.917
- [Nathan] It was clear
Sue was having trouble

00:06:33.917 --> 00:06:36.870
keeping buyers interested
with an incubus still present.

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:41.354
But I was hopeful all that
would change after our exorcism.

00:06:41.354 --> 00:06:42.187
(synthesized flash)
(spooky keyboard music)

00:06:42.187 --> 00:06:43.880
It was finally the night of the exorcism,

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.690
and after Brother Carlos,
our exorcist arrived,

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:48.898
Sue and I let him upstairs
to the bedroom where

00:06:48.898 --> 00:06:50.452
the entity was detected.

00:06:50.452 --> 00:06:54.408
- So what I'm gonna do, I'm
gonna anoint this place,

00:06:54.408 --> 00:06:55.333
- Mm hmm.
- Okay,

00:06:55.333 --> 00:06:57.132
and I'm going to command
the spirits to leave.

00:06:57.132 --> 00:06:58.678
(intense spooky music)
In the modern day of

00:06:58.678 --> 00:07:00.872
The Lord Jesus Christ,
come out evil spirits!

00:07:00.872 --> 00:07:04.367
Making people believe you are
spirits of bad humans, huh?

00:07:04.367 --> 00:07:06.912
Liars, liars and deceivers!

00:07:06.912 --> 00:07:08.859
Get out, get out of here!

00:07:08.859 --> 00:07:11.102
And don't ever, ever come back!

00:07:11.102 --> 00:07:11.935
(bells chiming)

00:07:11.935 --> 00:07:12.768
- After getting rid of the spirit,

00:07:12.768 --> 00:07:14.537
Brother Carlos insisted that he had to

00:07:14.537 --> 00:07:16.836
cleanse us as well, as
demons can sometimes

00:07:16.836 --> 00:07:19.601
attach themselves to
humans and manifest as

00:07:19.601 --> 00:07:20.695
physical ailments.

00:07:20.695 --> 00:07:23.823
- Do you have any health issues?

00:07:23.823 --> 00:07:25.602
Are you constantly getting sick?

00:07:25.602 --> 00:07:28.222
Do you have migraine headache
hitting you all the time?

00:07:28.222 --> 00:07:31.327
- I do have one thing, but it's kind of,

00:07:31.327 --> 00:07:34.088
private, personal?
- Alright.

00:07:34.088 --> 00:07:36.430
- It's a, hemorrhoids.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.388
- Yeah, that's demonic, oh yeah.

00:07:38.388 --> 00:07:39.221
- Okay.

00:07:39.221 --> 00:07:40.559
- So how do you say it again?

00:07:40.559 --> 00:07:41.772
I don't say this name very often.

00:07:41.772 --> 00:07:42.772
Hemorrhoids?

00:07:44.904 --> 00:07:46.592
- Hemorrhoids.
- Hemorrhoids, hemorrhoids.

00:07:46.592 --> 00:07:47.881
Yeah, I don't say this name very often.

00:07:47.881 --> 00:07:48.714
- Oh, I see.

00:07:48.714 --> 00:07:50.807
- So let me go ahead and
address this thing right now.

00:07:50.807 --> 00:07:51.640
Okay?

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.321
In the name of The Lord Jesus Christ,

00:07:53.321 --> 00:07:55.793
I command demons of hemorrhoids.

00:07:55.793 --> 00:07:57.884
I am casting you out evil
spirits, in the name of

00:07:57.884 --> 00:07:59.651
The Lord Jesus Christ.

00:07:59.651 --> 00:08:01.984
Hemorrhoid demons, come out!

00:08:03.099 --> 00:08:04.132
- Is it gone?

00:08:04.132 --> 00:08:05.516
- Wow, you look different.

00:08:05.516 --> 00:08:06.445
- I do?

00:08:06.445 --> 00:08:07.778
- Mm hmm.

00:08:07.778 --> 00:08:10.554
You look like something
just happened, definitely.

00:08:10.554 --> 00:08:11.387
- Wow.

00:08:11.387 --> 00:08:13.060
If Sue noticed a change that quickly,

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.817
I wanted to be sure to
leave no stone unturned.

00:08:15.817 --> 00:08:18.150
Can it help with penis size?

00:08:20.505 --> 00:08:21.735
- You see, yeah, okay.
- Do you have something

00:08:21.735 --> 00:08:22.619
for a small penis?

00:08:22.619 --> 00:08:25.050
- If it's demonic, yeah,
I can cast out the demon

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:25.883
from that.

00:08:25.883 --> 00:08:30.144
I don't have to say for
the thing to, you know,

00:08:30.144 --> 00:08:32.154
increase in size, or whatever.

00:08:32.154 --> 00:08:32.987
- Okay.

00:08:36.587 --> 00:08:37.839
- In the name of The Lord Jesus Christ,

00:08:37.839 --> 00:08:39.991
I command all of you demons!

00:08:39.991 --> 00:08:43.241
If there's a demon there, um, you know,

00:08:44.501 --> 00:08:47.751
affecting this man's penis male organs,

00:08:50.976 --> 00:08:55.735
making it smaller, whatever,
if there's any demon there,

00:08:55.735 --> 00:08:58.877
lodged in his penis right now, come out!

00:08:58.877 --> 00:09:01.888
In the name of Jesus Christ, come out!

00:09:01.888 --> 00:09:03.595
You might be free from this thing already.

00:09:03.595 --> 00:09:04.660
- Really?
- Oh yeah.

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.187
- After Brother Carlos had
addressed by personal demons.

00:09:07.187 --> 00:09:10.183
- I have extremely bad back
problem if that can be.

00:09:10.183 --> 00:09:11.016
- [Brother Carlos] Oh yeah.

00:09:11.016 --> 00:09:12.802
- He offered to help Sue
by removing the demons

00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:14.521
causing her back pain.

00:09:14.521 --> 00:09:16.279
- And as I am addressing
these demons right now,

00:09:16.279 --> 00:09:17.719
I'm gonna be more aggressive, okay,

00:09:17.719 --> 00:09:20.501
because I know you have
signs of someone that has

00:09:20.501 --> 00:09:22.088
demons inside, okay?

00:09:22.088 --> 00:09:22.921
So.
- Okay.

00:09:22.921 --> 00:09:24.248
- Just make eye contact with me right now.

00:09:24.248 --> 00:09:27.520
- Okay.
(intense spooky music)

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:30.095
- In the name of The Lord Jesus Christ,

00:09:30.095 --> 00:09:33.552
I command any evil spirit
that The Lord Jesus Christ

00:09:33.552 --> 00:09:36.591
has identified, to face divine judgement

00:09:36.591 --> 00:09:38.831
for violating this soul.

00:09:38.831 --> 00:09:41.355
In the name of The Lord Jesus
Christ, I command you now

00:09:41.355 --> 00:09:43.379
to get out of this woman
right now evil spirits.

00:09:43.379 --> 00:09:44.892
I command you now to get out!

00:09:44.892 --> 00:09:46.712
Demons look at my eyes!

00:09:46.712 --> 00:09:47.785
Look at my eyes!

00:09:47.785 --> 00:09:49.775
You've been messing up with her back, huh?

00:09:49.775 --> 00:09:50.796
Right devils!

00:09:50.796 --> 00:09:52.908
I'm commanding you to come out!

00:09:52.908 --> 00:09:55.539
I am commanding you to come out!

00:09:55.539 --> 00:09:56.830
I am commanding you to come out!

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:57.663
(Sue yells and cries)

00:09:57.663 --> 00:09:59.683
I am commanding you to
come out in the name of

00:09:59.683 --> 00:10:00.794
Jesus Christ, come out!

00:10:00.794 --> 00:10:01.627
Come out!

00:10:01.627 --> 00:10:02.460
Get out!

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:03.293
Get out!

00:10:03.293 --> 00:10:05.026
Come out of Sue's chest.

00:10:05.026 --> 00:10:05.873
Come out!

00:10:05.873 --> 00:10:06.706
Come out!

00:10:06.706 --> 00:10:07.804
Come out evil spirits!

00:10:07.804 --> 00:10:09.010
Come out evil spirits!

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:11.404
Demons messin' up with the
vertebrae's in the neck!

00:10:11.404 --> 00:10:14.407
Come out in the name of
Jesus Christ, come out!

00:10:14.407 --> 00:10:16.963
I want all demons out
of her spine, get out!

00:10:16.963 --> 00:10:18.239
(Sue cries)
Get out!

00:10:18.239 --> 00:10:19.221
Get out!

00:10:19.221 --> 00:10:20.440
Get out!

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.631
Get out!

00:10:21.631 --> 00:10:23.261
In the name of Jesus Christ, get out!

00:10:23.261 --> 00:10:24.094
(phone camera clicks)

00:10:24.094 --> 00:10:25.812
In the name of Jesus Christ, get out!

00:10:25.812 --> 00:10:26.645
Come out!

00:10:26.645 --> 00:10:27.604
Come out!

00:10:27.604 --> 00:10:28.642
Come out!

00:10:28.642 --> 00:10:29.680
Come out!

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.060
In the name of Jessuah, come out!

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.144
In the name of Jessuah, come out!

00:10:34.144 --> 00:10:36.959
Get out, look in my
eyes, you have to go now.

00:10:36.959 --> 00:10:38.625
- Uh huh.
You have to go!

00:10:38.625 --> 00:10:40.041
I'm casting you out, you have to go.

00:10:40.041 --> 00:10:41.676
- Okay.
- You have to go!

00:10:41.676 --> 00:10:42.884
Leave now!
(Sue moans softly)

00:10:42.884 --> 00:10:44.143
Leave now!
(Sue moans loudly)

00:10:44.143 --> 00:10:45.606
Leave now!
- Okay!

00:10:45.606 --> 00:10:47.603
- Leave, leave, leave!
- Stop it!

00:10:47.603 --> 00:10:48.744
- Leave!
- Stop it!

00:10:48.744 --> 00:10:49.577
- Leave!

00:10:49.577 --> 00:10:50.881
Go now, and don't ever come back.

00:10:50.881 --> 00:10:52.842
Take a deep breath three times, please.

00:10:52.842 --> 00:10:54.770
(Sue breathing deeply)

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:56.160
(sighs)

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.901
- You didn't hurt her or anything, right?

00:10:57.901 --> 00:10:58.734
- No.

00:10:58.734 --> 00:10:59.817
- Okay.

00:10:59.817 --> 00:11:02.824
'Cause she looks like she's almost dead.

00:11:02.824 --> 00:11:04.547
Are you okay Sue?
- Yeah,

00:11:04.547 --> 00:11:05.557
actually I'm fine.

00:11:05.557 --> 00:11:08.785
I think I've been feeling
a lot of relief now.

00:11:08.785 --> 00:11:11.818
It's amazing (sighs).

00:11:11.818 --> 00:11:15.985
(intense synthesized creepy music)
