00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.160
English historian and politician Lord Acton
famously said "Power tends to corrupt, and

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.900
absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great
men are almost always bad men." But how true

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.680
is that?

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.960
Hey guys, Julia here for DNews.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.820
One of the classic examples of twisted psychology
is the brutal 1971 Stanford prison experiment.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.820
Hand a bunch of regular college age guys power
without reservations and things turn very

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.980
dark, very quickly. But what was it about
being given power that changed these young

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.790
men so fast? Does power really corrupt? Or
is it in human nature to dominate completely

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.580
when in a position of privilege?

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.480
Dacher Keltner, professor of psychology at
the University of California Berkeley, believes

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.420
that empathy and social intelligence have
been shown to be important in acquiring power,

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.101
but these skills seem to be the first to go
when actually in a position of power. This

00:00:50.101 --> 00:00:51.760
is called the Power Paradox.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.550
Keltner’s research shows that when in groups,
humans tend to promote socially intelligent

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.630
and empathetic people to positions of power.
That we’re actually wary of people who seem

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.339
too self-serving and opportunistic. So we’re
pretty good at spying who is unfit for power,

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.500
and tend to rally around someone who does
want what’s best for the group. Unfortunately

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.869
once that person is given power… things
seem to go a little wrong.

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.020
Some wonder, does power corrupt? Or do the
corrupt seek power? It’s more the former

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.530
according to a study in the journal Leadership
Quality. Researchers analyzed people’s potential

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.630
for corruption by judging some of their personality
traits, like honesty. Then through a series

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.100
of experiments gave people varying degrees
of power over dividing up an amount of money.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.330
The people in positions of higher power tended
to make more anti-social choices than those

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.640
in a lower position of power. Even though
beforehand everyone agreed that the prosocial

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.431
choices were the best. But what’s interesting
in this study, is that the researchers, in

00:01:41.431 --> 00:01:45.600
one of the experiments, introduced a time
crunch. When under pressure from time, even

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.329
the more “honest” participants fell down
a more corrupt path.

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.909
And it’s not just the top dogs that are
corrupt. People stuck in the middle can act

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.770
horribly too. So think of like a prison guard,
they have almost no status, but a lot of power.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.130
Because of this, according to a study published
in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.650
guards are much more likely to act corruptly.
To test this researchers assigned students

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.170
to either a high status title “idea producer”
or a low status title “worker”.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.239
The students then told other students to perform
from a list of ten tasks. Some were pretty

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:18.319
demeaning like "bark like a dog three times."
They found, students in low status roles were

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.150
more likely to make their fellow participants
do the more demeaning tasks.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.450
Concluding that being in a low status position,
just makes us feel bad about ourselves, but

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.489
controlling someone else, helps alleviate
some of those bad feelings.

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.209
So there does seem to be something about power
that makes us behave in not the nicest of

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.879
ways. And it also goes to our heads. According
to a study published at the journal Psychological

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:42.129
Science, found that people in power suffer
from an illusion of control.

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:46.079
In a simple experiment the researchers assigned
people into groups, some with high power positions

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.549
such as “manager”. Then they were asked
to predict the outcome of rolling a pair of

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.189
dice. But when confronted with the option
to roll the dice themselves or let someone

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:58.019
else do it, every single person in the high
power group wanted to roll the dice themselves

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.489
compared to less than 70% of people in lower
positions. Basically they believed they could

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.500
control the outcome of something, even something
as random as a roll of a dice.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.909
While the roll of a dice isn’t that big
of a deal, such a mindset could have huge

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:14.110
implications for life and death matters, like
the outcome of corporate merger or war.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.799
and according to another study also published
in the journal Psychological Science, people

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:22.310
in positions of power tend to overestimate
their own height! People who feel powerful…

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.470
literally feel taller!

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.750
So, what should we do as a society? Well,
authors from the study in Journal of Experimental

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.050
Social Psychology said "find ways for all
individuals, regardless of the status of their

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.360
roles, to feel respected and valued,” because
"…respect assuages negative feelings about

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.780
their low-status roles and leads them to treat
others positively."

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.219
and the authors of the Leadership Quality
study say it’s more simple than that, "Organisations

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:47.969
should limit how much leaders can drink from
the seductive chalice of power."

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:52.189
So how do you think you would behave if you
had power?

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:56.630
So maybe Abraham Lincoln was right when he
said “Nearly all men can stand adversity,

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.060
but if you want to test a man’s character,
give him power.”

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:11.689
So it begs the question according the authors
of the study, “Can feeling powerful make

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:16.569
leaders less able to feel empathy and relate
to the "little people" because they literally

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:17.190
feel bigger?”
