ADAM: Well, I'm
Adam [? Quayo. ?]

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.560
thank you very much
for being here.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.520
I'm excited to see a lot
of faces that I do now

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.270
and then a lot of faces
that I don't know.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.310
So that's really
good that people are

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.350
excited to hear these ideas.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.630
As I introduce Rob, I
wanted to just share

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.160
a personal story of how these
powerful ideas have impacted

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.880
my life.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.040
So for that I'll use an
example from last year

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.830
where I was invited to speak at
an entrepreneurial conference.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:37.350
And, you know, I kept
putting off and putting off

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.250
planning this speech.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.270
It was just a 10-minute talk,
but I was kind of convinced

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.430
that I didn't really
have anything to share.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.980
So I just was like, eh, you
know what, I'll just wing it.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.330
And two hours
before my talk, Rob

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.660
gets up at the same
conference and shares

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.100
some ideas-- some of
which you'll hear today,

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.920
many of these have
evolved since then--

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.740
but even as I was hearing
him say that we often

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.490
sabotage ourselves to
give ourselves an out.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.220
So in this case I
was not planning

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.340
so that if I winged it and it
didn't go well I could say,

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.850
oh well, I just winged it
and I didn't really plan.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.660
So if I had planned it
would have been great.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.920
So I gave myself that out and
sure enough I went up there,

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.080
I winged it, and
it went all right,

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.790
but I didn't really crush
it like I would've hoped.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.710
But I winged it, so
what can I expect?

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.860
And as people kept coming up to
me and saying, hey, great job.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:34.485
Loved the talk.

00:01:34.485 --> 00:01:35.734
Thank you so much for sharing.

00:01:35.734 --> 00:01:36.690
I was like, really?

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:37.580
No way.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.890
That wasn't very good.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.570
I just winged it.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.100
So from the time I finished
my speech until about 10:00

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.680
PM that night I just
kept beating myself up.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.300
Just negative self talk.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.430
Man, you're so stupid.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.610
You didn't even plan this talk.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.270
You're up in front all
these people just rambling.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.740
And no matter how many people
kept telling me great job,

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.180
I wasn't hearing it.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.520
And then I ran in to
Rob later that night

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.880
at the bar for the after
party of this event.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.500
And he again said, great job.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.870
And I said, I don't really know.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.578
I just kind of got up
there and winged it

00:02:13.578 --> 00:02:15.210
and I don't think
it went very well.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.646
And he essentially
was like, do you mind

00:02:19.646 --> 00:02:20.770
if we do guided meditation?

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.770
I was like, well, we're
standing at the bar here

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.110
but all right, let's do it.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.750
Why not?

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.420
And so he guided me
through a meditation

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.110
and he basically created
the space for this idea

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.740
that no matter what happens,
whether that speech was great

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.910
or that speech was terrible
in any moment we have a choice

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.830
to decide is this thought that's
running through my head useful

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.160
or not useful?

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.410
And if it's not useful, you
can just choose to let it go.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.330
So that's really stuck with me
in this high pressure Google

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.580
environment that we all work
in where we're constantly

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.480
trying to innovate and
do really cool things.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.900
There's some negative self talk
that comes in for me a lot.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.810
And so now I can just decide
is that useful or not useful.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.210
So that's just one
thing that I wanted

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.770
to share because it really made
a huge impact on me and the way

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.010
that I look at things.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.910
And so please join me in
welcoming my friend Rob Scott

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.790
to the stage and to Google.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.170
Thanks for being here, Rob.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.045
ROB SCOTT: Thank you.

00:03:22.045 --> 00:03:23.445
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:26.800
Hi, everybody.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.410
How are you guys doing today?

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.910
Good?

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:29.510
Doing well?

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.440
Awesome.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.130
So this talk is called
"The Fundamental Shift."

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.070
And I'm really planning to
give you guys a really, really

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.520
tangible fundamental shift.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.330
And the subtitle of this is how
to destroy any limiting belief

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.240
and master your mind, which
might sound slightly dramatic.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.420
It's like master your mind.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.240
What is that?

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.040
But I'm hoping to make
that really tangible

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.790
and give you guys a
profound understanding

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.164
of a different way that we
can kind of relate to our mind

00:03:53.164 --> 00:03:55.740
and deal with our mind and
really tangible tools that Adam

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.520
gave an example of right there.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.980
Before we dive in,
I want to really

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.944
kind of get down to the
reality that you guys want

00:04:02.944 --> 00:04:04.110
to make a difference, right?

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.930
This is your time.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.000
This matters.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.110
And you guys are important
and you're up to cool things.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.800
And so to come spend time,
this should make a difference.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.250
So in that can we set
an intention together

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.200
that maybe we open
to the possibility

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.829
that this talk could
profoundly change you.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.930
There's a lot of different
things that happen.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.500
There's a lot different
things that we can experience.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.920
We could be wasting time
watching TV or doing whatever.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.240
Some time is more
valuable than other time.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.160
So I want you to open to
the possibility maybe even

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.890
in a collective
breath or something

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.210
that we could all kind of
set the intention that this

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.220
is really profound.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.720
That we actually
do something that's

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.020
really meaningful long
term for you guys.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.580
So is that possible?

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.250
Think about some other powerful
ideas that changed the game.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.164
Things like the
wheel or figuring out

00:04:53.164 --> 00:04:55.330
what your next move is,
where you're going to apply,

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.050
or maybe meeting
your partner in life.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.190
Some moments really matter.

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.500
And so what if I
could promise you

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.180
a shift caused you not only to
become incredibly productive

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.310
but also deeply fulfilled
at the same time?

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.580
Because we've kind of
got two worlds going on.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.150
We've got the world of being
and experience and sort

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.860
of the art of fulfillment.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.210
And then we've got the
doing, the success part.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.980
And they both really matter.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.390
They both really matter.

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.050
Tony Robbins or somebody like
that is awesome at success.

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.320
And maybe Eckhart Tolle is
really awesome at presence.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.680
We want to master both.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.920
And so for this shift that
we're talking about today

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.480
it really does apply
to both of those areas.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.340
And so my intention is to
create that space for that shift

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.570
in you guys today.

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.720
And minimally I promise that
I'm going to share at least one

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.320
incredibly valuable idea
with you today and probably

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.370
many of them.

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.760
So last little
intro here is I want

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.810
you to relax and just trust that
you can get the transmission.

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.025
We're really, really
good at communicating.

00:05:56.025 --> 00:05:57.650
You don't have to
furiously take notes,

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.120
although you may choose
to write some things down.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.300
But just relax into this.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.040
Let's have fun.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.150
Let's enjoy this time and
make it really valuable, OK?

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.570
So things that I'm going
to cover today quickly,

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:08.950
I'm going to share a
little bit more about me.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:10.744
Many of you probably
have no idea who I am.

00:06:10.744 --> 00:06:12.910
And so I want to let you
know a little bit about why

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.880
I get to come and talk to you.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.564
I'm going to talk
and share with you

00:06:16.564 --> 00:06:18.230
through hopefully a
visualization you'll

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:22.130
join me in the cost of
our limiting beliefs.

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.740
We're going to talk about
where these beliefs come from,

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.800
because it's really important
to understand how insidious

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.040
and kind of sneaky they can be.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.630
And I'm going to share with
you some of the reasons why

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.625
we can't see them.

00:06:34.625 --> 00:06:36.750
How do we get in touch with
them when we don't even

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:37.810
know they're there.

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.940
Is it possible you're
carrying a limiting belief

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:41.439
and you don't even
know you have it.

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:43.116
It just feels like
a truth to you.

00:06:43.116 --> 00:06:45.490
And then we're going to talk
about the single change that

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.220
shifts everything.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.940
Some things you should
take away is really

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.920
how to master your beliefs.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.320
After this talk I want you guys
to have access to mastering

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.940
your own belief structures.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.060
I want you to understand
this concept of lenses

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.010
that I'm going to go
into in depth today.

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:04.490
We're going to talk about a
formula for procrastination.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:04.990
OK?

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:06.614
There's actually a
formula that kind of

00:07:06.614 --> 00:07:08.660
explains why we choose
to procrastinate

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:10.880
or why we feel resistance
when we're trying to do

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.140
some important piece of work.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.515
And we're going to get
into impostor syndrome.

00:07:16.515 --> 00:07:18.390
I don't know if any of
you ever feel slightly

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:20.200
fraudulent or worried
that maybe they'll

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:25.070
find out that I'm really not as
special as I like to think I am

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:26.430
or that I hope they think I am.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:28.388
So we're going to talk
about impostor syndrome.

00:07:28.388 --> 00:07:30.520
And then other things
like core story,

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.549
meaning making, where you get
into it what truth is actually

00:07:33.549 --> 00:07:34.090
in this talk.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.630
But the most important takeaway
is the fundamental shift

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.760
that changes everything.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.790
So why should you listen to me?

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:44.040
Why would you spend this time?

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.610
Well, I'm Rob Scott and
I wish that was enough.

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:50.020
But there's probably
more to it than that.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.850
I went through some really
major abuse as a child.

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:54.781
And not to be overly
graphic or whatever,

00:07:54.781 --> 00:07:57.030
but there was a period of
time from like three or four

00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:00.210
to about eight or nine where
I was actually being raped

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:03.490
and just really violently
sexually abused, et cetera.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:05.669
And not only that,
but other dysfunctions

00:08:05.669 --> 00:08:08.210
in the family and addiction in
the family and all that stuff.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:11.290
These things left me scarred
physically, emotionally,

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:11.990
and mentally.

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:14.800
I basically didn't feel safe.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:20.240
I didn't have a lot
of emotional maturity.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.690
I kind of got stunted in
a lot of ways emotionally

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:23.670
and in other things.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:26.210
And so I turned to
drugs and alcohol,

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:28.730
starting to play with them
as early as 7-years-old.

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:31.890
And when I had my first
nephew in my life,

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:33.620
when I looked at how
old he was at seven,

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.789
and now I have a boy in my
life through my girlfriend

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:40.450
and my partner who's six, it
just kind of blows my mind

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:43.150
that that was what was
going on for me at that age.

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.460
And so later that
grew into me being

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:51.050
in and out of institutions and
jails and just a ton of chaos

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:52.610
and I ended up homeless.

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:54.860
I was not able to
deal with life.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.195
So I was horribly dysfunctional.

00:08:57.195 --> 00:08:59.610
Like pretty much as bad
as it gets without dying.

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.050
I had a lot of people
around me that died,

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:05.770
commit suicide, gun fights, all
kinds of crazy stuff like that.

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:08.310
And so I was living
as a victim and I

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:10.620
was unable to deal
with my own life.

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.740
And after all that
was going on and I

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:15.220
began trying to get
my life back together,

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:18.810
I had my next challenge and I
got really sick with cancer.

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:22.530
And so here's a picture of
me going through chemotherapy

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:23.960
and smoking.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.890
And right above that
which is out of frame

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:27.440
is a No Smoking sign.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:31.010
So that was the kind
of guy that I was.

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:31.510
Right?

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:36.460
I'm rolling my chemo dose
outside to smoke back then.

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:37.710
So that was what was going on.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.260
My mom actually
worked close to where

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.030
I was getting this treatment.

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:41.480
And I didn't know
she was walking up

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.020
but she came up and just
took a picture of me

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:44.350
and that's what this is.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:49.040
So I know what it is to
be really sick mentally,

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.490
emotionally, and physically.

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:51.460
I'm in touch with that.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:55.250
And from that abuse and sickness
and homelessness and addiction

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:57.240
and all that stuff,
what happened?

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.140
Well I had a profound
shift in awareness.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:02.872
Somewhere along the way I
really woke up to the victim

00:10:02.872 --> 00:10:03.580
that I was doing.

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.790
And I realized that nobody
was punching me anymore.

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:08.730
Nobody was doing anything, but
I was carrying a story with me

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:10.180
that was no longer empowering.

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:15.270
It was very, very difficult
to function because poor me.

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:16.582
Look at all I've been through.

00:10:16.582 --> 00:10:17.790
And I really woke up to that.

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:19.560
And it was deeply profound.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.540
And a new level of consciousness
became available to me.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:25.640
I didn't relate to my brain
in the same way again.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.500
And from then just a few short
years I went from being a temp,

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.030
like my first attempt to getting
a job after being homeless

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:33.910
was filing papers in the
basement of a company.

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:36.290
And a few years after that
I became the youngest vice

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:38.790
president-- I had moved
companies-- but it

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:39.790
was a different company.

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:41.590
And I was running
technology and building

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:43.240
and I built and
sold a big business

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.600
for them, a big software
company, and all that.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.860
And so I learned to
manage myself and others

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:50.130
and started to get really
incredible results.

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:53.150
But I also felt deep
fulfilment and happiness.

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:56.890
There was a being and doing that
was really addressed in this.

00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:58.930
So in 2005 I started
a podcast where

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:01.220
I was sharing ideas
about conscious evolution

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.220
and what is it, what's
hypnosis, and what's NLP,

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.469
and what are all these things
about managing our brain

00:11:05.469 --> 00:11:06.840
and getting better results?

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.710
And people all over the world
started asking me for coaching.

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:12.499
So Japan and Australia
and Ireland and Canada

00:11:12.499 --> 00:11:13.790
and a lot in the United States.

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:18.080
And so about a decade ago
I left the corporate world

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:21.170
to start this company where
I get to help people and help

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:22.910
them get better
results, help them

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:26.814
resolve a lot of inner
conflict, and just grow.

00:11:26.814 --> 00:11:28.230
So I know what it
takes to change.

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:30.620
I've done it myself and I've
helped thousands of others

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:31.860
do it, as well.

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:35.250
And what it really takes
is this fundamental shift

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:37.160
that I'm going to be
sharing with you today.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.251
So are you guys ready
to dive in on this?

00:11:39.251 --> 00:11:40.750
Do you want to know
more about this?

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:42.980
And does this sound important?

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:43.564
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:11:43.564 --> 00:11:44.938
ROB SCOTT: I get
like quiet nods.

00:11:44.938 --> 00:11:45.620
That's awesome.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:46.380
How about a little louder?

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:47.820
Do you want to hear
about this or no?

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:48.190
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:48.460
ROB SCOTT: All right.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:49.390
Awesome.

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:52.340
So when people hire me, when
people come to work with me,

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:56.120
they often want very
different things.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:01.180
But there's three or so
flavors of what people want.

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.951
First they want often better
stuff to happen in their life.

00:12:03.951 --> 00:12:04.950
They want better events.

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:05.900
They want to get the house.

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:07.275
They want to get
the girl or guy.

00:12:07.275 --> 00:12:08.940
They want to have the new job.

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:11.630
They want better events
to happen in their world.

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:13.910
The next one is they
want to feel better.

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:16.697
Some people come to me and they
go, I'm anxious all the time.

00:12:16.697 --> 00:12:18.280
How can you help me
be more confident?

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.310
Or I'm depressed.

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:21.550
I can't figure out
happiness, et cetera.

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:24.832
So there's this focus on state
and how they feel that way.

00:12:24.832 --> 00:12:27.290
And then the last one is many
people come and they're like,

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:30.070
I can't stick to my habits
or I can't break this habit.

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:32.490
I want to work out all
the time but I can't.

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:34.392
So they want
different behaviors.

00:12:34.392 --> 00:12:36.350
And I just want to show
a little bit of a model

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:39.920
here for you guys
about how this works.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.660
Events happen out there, and of
course we want different ones,

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:45.390
but as events happen
to us they end up

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.000
making us feel a certain way.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.790
And so these events lead
to a certain state for us.

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:53.427
Events happen, we
sort of have them,

00:12:53.427 --> 00:12:54.760
they make us feel a certain way.

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:57.730
If we feel a certain
way, that affects what?

00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:59.520
So events affect our state.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.670
Our state affects our behaviors.

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:05.022
And if I'm confident I'll
take different behaviors

00:13:05.022 --> 00:13:06.480
than if I'm anxious
about something

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.327
or if I'm fearful,
if I'm depressed.

00:13:08.327 --> 00:13:10.660
That's going to change what
I choose to do in the world.

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.870
And then our behaviors,
to whatever degree,

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:13.890
affects our events.

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:14.980
It doesn't have total
control over it.

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:15.688
None of these do.

00:13:15.688 --> 00:13:18.150
But this is a loop of
how our life goes by.

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:19.380
Events happen.

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:21.340
It creates a certain
feeling in us.

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:22.950
That creates certain behavior.

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:23.700
We get new events.

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.490
And that goes on like that.

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:27.560
So let's be clear.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:29.050
We want all of it.

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:31.820
We actually want better
events to happen in our life.

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:34.020
We also want better
state experiences.

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:37.270
And we also want more
control over our behavior.

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:40.310
And there's one
place on that slide

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:43.022
that we're going to make a
slight addition to later that's

00:13:43.022 --> 00:13:44.230
going to be the game changer.

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:46.146
So this slide you'll be
seeing it again later.

00:13:46.146 --> 00:13:47.736
And there's one
place where we're

00:13:47.736 --> 00:13:49.110
going to make a
big change there,

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:51.410
and I'll share
what that is later.

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:54.580
Before we really get
started, I want to find out

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:56.790
what limiting beliefs cost us.

00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:59.970
And I'd like to do that kind
of experientially if that's OK.

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:01.680
So if you guys are
open to it, would you

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.710
do a visualization with me?

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:04.430
Yeah?

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:04.930
OK.

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:06.480
Again, really quiet.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.355
Yes?

00:14:07.355 --> 00:14:08.200
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:08.500
ROB SCOTT: Awesome.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:08.780
Good.

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:09.280
All right.

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.100
So get comfortable
in your chair.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.670
And go ahead and just start
to get in touch with like what

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:15.300
your breath feels like.

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:17.850
And I'm going to invite
you all to close your eyes.

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:19.800
And anybody watching
the recording

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.930
go ahead and close your
eyes and really get

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:24.770
into this experience.

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:26.620
I want you to notice
your breath as it

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:28.070
goes in and out of your body.

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:31.750
And you may notice
that down in your belly

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:37.210
as you breathe in it's almost
as if a balloon is expanding.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:40.830
And you can feel that
expand and contract.

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:46.540
You may notice the slight hum
of technology in the room.

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:48.926
You can hear that.

00:14:48.926 --> 00:14:50.300
I'm going to invite
you to notice

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:51.466
another part of your breath.

00:14:51.466 --> 00:14:55.440
You can maybe notice what
the rim of your nostrils

00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:00.140
feels like as you
breathe in and out.

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:02.590
Cool, dry air going in.

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:06.770
Maybe a little bit warm, a
little bit more moist air

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:08.874
leaving.

00:15:08.874 --> 00:15:11.290
And I'm going to invite you
to scan your body for anywhere

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:14.363
that feels pleasurable.

00:15:14.363 --> 00:15:17.027
Any sensations that
feel comfortable.

00:15:17.027 --> 00:15:19.110
I'm noticing what my feet
feel like on the ground.

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:21.200
You may notice your
seat in the chair.

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.060
So this is presence.

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:27.580
There's not really
any thought here.

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:29.730
This is just experience.

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:33.000
And this is a fantastic place
to get really grounded into

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.360
and know about.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.890
But now we're going to actually
start to use our imagination.

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:39.390
So keep your eyes
closed, but I want

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:43.430
you to imagine a person maybe
down in a way and kind of

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:45.680
off to the left so you
could see over their life.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:50.960
And this person is a lot
like you but they're not you.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:52.730
But they have goals
like you have.

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:54.410
They want to be successful.

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:57.220
They want to be loved.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:00.324
They want to have friendships.

00:16:00.324 --> 00:16:01.740
See this person
going through life

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:05.979
trying to achieve all the things
that they're trying to achieve.

00:16:05.979 --> 00:16:08.020
Have the connections that
they're trying to have.

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:11.150
And yet they walk through
life thinking these kinds

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:12.360
of thoughts about themselves.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:17.300
They say, I have no energy.

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:19.510
I hate my body.

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:22.830
I'm fat and I'm ugly.

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:23.490
I'm too lazy.

00:16:25.954 --> 00:16:27.120
People don't really like me.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.200
I'm not lovable.

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.770
I'm not approachable.

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:31.520
I'm kind of nerdy.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.230
Nobody really gets me.

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:37.360
See them trying to shake
hands, meet people,

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.733
forward their initiatives
what they want to do.

00:16:39.733 --> 00:16:41.733
And yet they say things
in their head, you know,

00:16:41.733 --> 00:16:42.649
I already have enough.

00:16:42.649 --> 00:16:45.540
I shouldn't want anymore.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.040
I'm not really very smart.

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.510
I'm certainly not as smart
as people think I am.

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:54.160
What if they find out that
I'm not what I say I am?

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.050
I'll never be rich.

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:56.690
I'll never have enough time.

00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:58.360
I'm always late.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.330
I'm going to mess this up.

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:01.420
Nothing I do matters.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:04.329
I'm just not enough.

00:17:04.329 --> 00:17:07.200
I'm just not enough.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.660
Get really in touch
with this person.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:12.308
Up late at night worried
about their life.

00:17:12.308 --> 00:17:13.599
Worried about different things.

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:17.339
Trying to go to sleep and
those thoughts creep in again.

00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:20.670
My family doesn't
really love me.

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:22.000
I'm never really happy.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.416
I kind of don't
know what that is.

00:17:23.416 --> 00:17:25.790
The world is scary
and dangerous.

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:26.829
I'm kind of a loser.

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:28.620
This isn't really going
to work out for me.

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:32.990
I want you to keep
your eyes closed,

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:35.550
but you can answer out loud
if it makes sense to you.

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:39.302
How's that person going to
do with their goals in life?

00:17:39.302 --> 00:17:41.510
Are they going to do really
well or are they going to

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:44.362
do not so well?

00:17:44.362 --> 00:17:45.570
Go ahead and answer out loud.

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:48.010
Are they going to
do not so well?

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:49.840
They're not going
to do very well.

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:53.960
It's almost like they're
carrying a huge albatross.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.970
They're just weighed
down like they've

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:59.130
got a weight on their
ankle carrying them down.

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:02.110
So I want you to now
imagine another person.

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:04.160
Maybe they're down and
away off to the right

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.370
and you can see them.

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:07.770
And this person
has no advantages

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:09.220
over the first person.

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:10.930
They don't have
more connections.

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:12.630
They don't have any more money.

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:15.000
They don't have any
more intelligence.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.070
In fact, they're
not even as smart.

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:19.710
They don't have as many friends.

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:21.550
Their style isn't even as good.

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:24.530
They don't dress as well.

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:25.726
And they have similar goals.

00:18:25.726 --> 00:18:26.850
They want to be successful.

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:27.800
They want to be loved.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.310
They want all these things.

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:34.120
And the difference between this
person and the first person

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.850
is that their brain
is saying things

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:39.020
like this-- I love what I do.

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:42.430
I'm really, really
good at my job.

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:44.070
My mind is incredible.

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:47.020
I can't believe
how well it works.

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:49.720
I love learning and growing.

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:52.120
I love making and saving money.

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.800
I feel so grateful and happy.

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:57.730
I love my body.

00:18:57.730 --> 00:18:58.730
How it takes care of me.

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:02.370
See this person meeting
people, deciding to work,

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:04.427
deciding to show up,
deciding to apply themselves

00:19:04.427 --> 00:19:05.260
to different things.

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:09.700
See them bebopping along going
I feel like I'm in my purpose.

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:11.540
I love focusing on
what matters most.

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:12.680
I get great results.

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.200
I make a difference.

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.920
I love how much energy I have.

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.770
I am enough.

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:19.485
I am amazing.

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:23.620
I love meeting people.

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:24.880
I feel so grateful, happy.

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:25.660
I'm enough.

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:26.830
I get great results.

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:29.442
How is this person going to do?

00:19:29.442 --> 00:19:30.650
Go ahead and answer out loud.

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:35.040
Are they going to do OK or are
they going to be struggling?

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.149
They're going to be doing
really, really well.

00:19:37.149 --> 00:19:38.690
And I want you to
notice while you're

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:40.481
thinking about this
person that they're not

00:19:40.481 --> 00:19:42.760
going to be successful
in the future,

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.740
this is an expression
of success now

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:47.846
with all the disadvantages
without everything.

00:19:47.846 --> 00:19:49.720
Hold in your mind for
a second the difference

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:50.761
between those two people.

00:19:53.655 --> 00:19:55.780
And I want you to just
breathe into that difference

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:58.310
and when you feel comfortable
you can open up your eyes

00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:59.250
and join us back here.

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:09.214
So are we clear on the cost
of what our thought is?

00:20:09.214 --> 00:20:10.880
Do you guys feel the
difference in that?

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.000
Can you feel that the
invitation of even

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.920
a single negative thought
can make us not do something?

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:19.680
It can cost us
quite a bit, yeah?

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.710
And these beliefs don't
have to be 100% true.

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:23.210
We're not talking
about somebody who

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:25.840
is that kind of stuck in it.

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.450
Imagine just going to a party
with the simple difference

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:31.497
of in one moment feeling
really connected,

00:20:31.497 --> 00:20:33.080
like I can't wait
to be in this party.

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:34.770
Oh my god, all these people
are my close friends.

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:36.103
This is going to be so much fun.

00:20:36.103 --> 00:20:40.310
Versus having a different
thought of I feel separate.

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:41.470
I don't feel connected.

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:42.580
This isn't my tribe.

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:43.570
I don't like them.

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:46.542
This party's going
to suck or whatever.

00:20:46.542 --> 00:20:48.750
One person's going to actually
see a different party.

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:50.261
Same party.

00:20:50.261 --> 00:20:52.135
One person who's connected
and looking for it

00:20:52.135 --> 00:20:53.560
is going to be super thrilled.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:54.170
How you doing?

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:54.710
Oh my god.

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:54.810
What's going on?

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:55.310
Hey.

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:56.250
It's good to see you.

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:57.350
Right?

00:20:57.350 --> 00:21:00.410
Somebody else is going
to be kind of inviting

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:01.270
this negative thing.

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:03.186
Can you guys feel the
difference between that?

00:21:03.186 --> 00:21:05.720
That just that in any
moment our thoughts

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:08.440
have that kind of control over
what's going to happen for us.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:11.700
So let's go over a couple
ways we can pick up these

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:14.010
limiting beliefs in our life.

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:16.920
I want to introduce an idea
called your core story.

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:19.130
A friend and mentor of
mine, [? Mark Ofney, ?]

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:21.020
calls this your core sentence.

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:24.390
And what I want you to do is
I want you to imagine yourself

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:25.450
as a baby.

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:25.950
All right?

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:28.525
And you don't have a
huge sense of self yet.

00:21:28.525 --> 00:21:29.900
You're still
completely dependent

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:31.430
on your primary caregivers.

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:32.210
And you're there.

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:34.150
And every time you
cry, you're met

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:36.840
with a bottle or
your wiped clean,

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.690
or you're sort of
doted on and dealt

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:42.710
with until there was a
first time where maybe

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:46.310
your mom was busy doing dishes
or didn't hear you or whatever.

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:50.230
There's a first time that your
primary caregiver didn't come.

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:53.720
And when that happens
there's a bit of a crisis.

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.870
There's this kind of, oh no.

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:57.330
What happened here?

00:21:57.330 --> 00:22:00.050
And so that first
hurt led to a meaning.

00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:03.150
And ultimately it's
really hard to blame

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:04.820
the all powerful caregiver.

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:09.890
It's very hard to say this
all powerful godlike creature

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:13.100
that's giving me all
my needs meeting those

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:14.680
that there's some flaw there.

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:16.680
There can't be something
wrong with the universe

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.170
or it's just too unsafe.

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:19.880
So there must be
something wrong with me.

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:20.380
Right?

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:22.960
There must be something
wrong with me.

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:26.630
And so we end up making
a meaning out of that.

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:29.560
And some possible meanings
that we can start to grab onto

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:32.270
are maybe I don't deserve love.

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:34.120
Maybe in this moment
I don't deserve love.

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:37.370
Maybe I didn't do right or I was
too loud or I was too annoying.

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:42.270
Maybe I'm too much
for my mother.

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:43.490
Maybe nobody loves me.

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:46.310
Maybe love isn't
real or permanent.

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:47.900
Maybe the world's
just dangerous.

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:51.520
And my personal favorite
is I'm not enough.

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:53.050
Maybe I'm just not enough.

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:56.050
Maybe I am not enough.

00:22:56.050 --> 00:23:00.640
So when that becomes true for us
as a small child, what ends up

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.620
happening is we grow
up continually looking

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:04.742
for examples of that truth.

00:23:04.742 --> 00:23:06.950
That truth made sense out
of something in the moment,

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:10.990
so it becomes what
we think is real.

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:13.860
And so we end up seeing not
enough kind of everywhere.

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:17.517
If I'm not enough, well,
I don't have enough time.

00:23:17.517 --> 00:23:18.600
I don't have enough money.

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:20.683
There's all these examples
of where that shows up,

00:23:20.683 --> 00:23:21.843
this not enough.

00:23:21.843 --> 00:23:23.390
I'm not popular enough.

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:24.720
I'm not funny enough.

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.030
I'm not pretty enough.

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:26.990
My car's not enough.

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:28.323
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

00:23:28.323 --> 00:23:31.680
It becomes this prism
that we look through kind

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:32.934
of at the whole world.

00:23:32.934 --> 00:23:34.350
And that's because
this truth made

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:35.940
us feel safe in the moment.

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:39.630
It's how the world made
sense to us at one point, OK?

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:42.060
So we actually live
into that belief.

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:45.810
And if you think about that
in any way, maybe some of you

00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:49.090
can identify with this
sense of I'm not enough.

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:50.170
I'm not smart enough.

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:52.480
I'm not standing out enough.

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:56.480
I'm not really where
I'm supposed to be yet.

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:59.280
So this belief is
potentially I'm not enough,

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:02.270
but it could be any of
those other ones, as well.

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:07.100
Can you see how subtle
and non-obvious this is?

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:09.510
It's from the very
beginning of our narrative

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:11.000
potentially of growing up.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.620
And it just becomes
kind of true.

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:15.200
It's like we have this
facade of I'm totally enough.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:15.830
Yeah, sure.

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:16.560
I got it.

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:17.650
We're cool.

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:19.440
But down deep I'm
worried about it

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:22.270
because maybe I'm not enough.

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:24.940
So I want to quickly
look at another example.

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:27.685
And this is really the
formula for procrastination.

00:24:27.685 --> 00:24:29.560
And if you're not taking
notes, that's great.

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:30.935
I'm not inviting
you to, but this

00:24:30.935 --> 00:24:33.740
might be something cool to just
make a note of in your head.

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:35.670
The formula is this.

00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:41.550
Self worth equals ability
which equals performance.

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:43.490
And for this I
want you to imagine

00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:49.986
that you are potentially
a hunter 10,000 years ago.

00:24:49.986 --> 00:24:53.330
And you eat a lot as a hunter
but you're not performing.

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:56.380
You're not actually bringing
back food to the tribe.

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:59.370
So you're doing your best,
but it's just not working out.

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:02.960
All of a sudden your lack of
performance might be fatal.

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.570
They might say,
hey, stop eating.

00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:05.990
You're eating too much.

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:08.230
You're not bringing
in enough food here.

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:10.960
Or they might actually
leave you or whatever.

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:14.870
So it's possible that
in our DNA in our way

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:18.610
we have this ability to
really connect with this idea

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:22.730
that my self worth, my
value as a human being,

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:26.260
is proven by my
ability at things.

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:29.600
And my ability is proven
by my performance.

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.170
Does that makes sense?

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:34.000
Like I may not really be
worthy as a human being

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.820
to be taking up the resources
or doing whatever if I don't

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:38.740
perform exceptionally well.

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:41.020
If I can't perform fantastic.

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:45.110
Well, what procrastination
does-- procrastination is not

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:46.540
like a problem in your mind.

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:48.100
It actually gives us an excuse.

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:50.760
It actually kind of
breaks this formula

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:54.550
because the cost of performing
becomes very, very high.

00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:57.710
And if I can avoid performance
when these kinds of things

00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:00.640
are true for me, if I
can avoid performance

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:04.170
I can keep a story of a
really high self worth.

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:06.200
I can keep a story of I matter.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:09.872
Man, me and my
potential is amazing.

00:26:09.872 --> 00:26:10.580
So what do we do?

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:12.030
We stay disorganized.

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:15.509
Or we leave certain
things unattended to.

00:26:15.509 --> 00:26:16.550
Or we just don't show up.

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:19.640
Or, in Adam's case, we
don't prepare the talk.

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.650
So that unconsciously
or subconsciously

00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:23.279
we can show up
with the excuse of,

00:26:23.279 --> 00:26:24.820
you know what, if
I'd really studied,

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:26.650
I would have done fantastic.

00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:28.330
I would've done amazing.

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:31.710
But because I didn't
study I got a 78 on that.

00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:35.030
So that's OK, because there's
a version of me that could

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:37.060
have shown up and been amazing.

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:41.760
But if I really do try as hard
as I can or I really do show up

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:45.470
and then I fail, than
I'm really not worthy.

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:48.112
And this comes up in subtle
ways across all kinds of things.

00:26:48.112 --> 00:26:50.320
When we have parents that
are like, did you get an A?

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.900
Oh, you got a B.
Did you get an A?

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:53.400
Awesome.

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:54.675
Did you get the best score?

00:26:54.675 --> 00:26:55.175
Oh.

00:26:55.175 --> 00:26:57.250
Somebody else in your
class is ahead of you?

00:26:57.250 --> 00:26:57.750
All right.

00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:59.880
Well, try harder next time.

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:05.120
So our worth is equated
to our performance.

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:08.740
And it puts a huge amount
of pressure on performing.

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:10.720
So what procrastination
does is it

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:14.520
allows us to have a fully
worthy version of ourselves

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.340
in our psyche.

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:19.000
And this unchecked can
lead to impostor syndrome.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.170
It can lead to a
whole lot of fakery

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:25.960
in certain situations
about who you really are.

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:27.810
And we end up hiding
in all kinds of ways.

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:31.360
And one of my stories
about this is Fonzie Cool.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:35.790
I had this idea of growing up
that Fonzie was super duper

00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:36.457
cool.

00:27:36.457 --> 00:27:38.040
And I don't know if
you guys remember,

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:41.970
but he used to bang the
jukebox and it would turn on.

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:43.880
And he would hit the
lights like that.

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.290
And when he danced he just
did this and girls kind of

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:48.200
circled around like magically.

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.886
And I grew up as a TV baby
watching Fonzie and going

00:27:50.886 --> 00:27:52.852
like, he's got it amazing.

00:27:52.852 --> 00:27:53.560
Look at this guy.

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:55.720
He's the jam.

00:27:55.720 --> 00:28:00.860
And so me feeling so much shame,
so much embarrassment about who

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:03.720
I really was, I
developed-- and not

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.490
consciously, I'm
a kid doing this,

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:07.300
this was kind of like
the game I played--

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:11.200
I developed this bravado
of I'm Fonzie Cool.

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.010
Nothing gets to me.

00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:13.850
We'll do whatever
you want to do.

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:14.420
Let's do it.

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:15.640
I don't rattle.

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:16.290
I'm good to go.

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:17.645
I can do anything.

00:28:17.645 --> 00:28:19.520
And in a lot of ways
that got me in to really

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:23.080
dangerous situations
because I would go do crazy

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:24.810
stuff to be Fonzie Cool.

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:27.950
But also it really held me back
from doing things like this.

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:31.240
I used to be absolutely
phobic-- not just afraid,

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:34.070
not just anxious--
but completely phobic

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:35.910
about giving a public talk.

00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:36.880
Now why is that?

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:39.697
Because I had an unconscious
impostor syndrome going

00:28:39.697 --> 00:28:42.030
on where if you'd asked me I
would've earnestly told you

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:42.760
I am this cool.

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:43.434
I am Fonzie.

00:28:43.434 --> 00:28:44.350
Like, that's going on.

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:47.370
But in reality I
was not that at all.

00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:49.120
And what would happen
when I would come up

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:51.620
to give a speech was
my hand might shake

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:53.000
or my voice might shake.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.690
And the mere
possibility that people

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:59.630
could look through that to see
that it might really be true

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:04.840
that I'm worthless and not
this kind of magical cool guy,

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:06.360
I couldn't resolve it.

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:09.364
And so for years-- like
I didn't go to college

00:29:09.364 --> 00:29:10.280
because of this stuff.

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:11.460
I'm like, do they
have to give talks?

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:11.959
Oh, they do.

00:29:11.959 --> 00:29:13.810
I can't do that and I'm out.

00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:16.780
So think about the limits that
that would put on someone if it

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:19.430
wasn't addressed or dealt with.

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:23.910
So another possible belief--
and these are just two,

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:27.020
one is I'm not enougg-- this
one is my value is directly

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:29.190
linked to my performance.

00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:30.260
But I have news for you.

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:33.620
That formula is bullshit
because our self worth

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:35.740
should be inherent.

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:38.580
And to a child that is
loved differently or made

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:40.780
to feel more safe,
what ends up happening

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:45.234
for them is that if they
need to go give a talk

00:29:45.234 --> 00:29:47.400
it's just something they
do even if they're nervous.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.316
It's like, sure I was
nervous, because there's

00:29:49.316 --> 00:29:52.740
no kind of attack on
their identity about that.

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:53.420
Right?

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:55.940
I used to do things,
like an example

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:57.195
I always use is bowling.

00:29:57.195 --> 00:29:58.570
I would be invited
to go bowling.

00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:00.940
And I'd be like, sure,
it'll be my first time.

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:03.350
But I would go
practice privately so

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:07.540
that I would be amazing or
amazing for the first time.

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:09.190
Whatever I could do
in the three days.

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:11.230
And then I'd show
up and pretend.

00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:14.820
Total imposter, be completely
inauthentic about that I'd

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:16.540
been playing for
three days, hoping

00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:18.248
that the people at
bowling alley wouldn't

00:30:18.248 --> 00:30:20.400
be like, good to see you again.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.900
And then I'd go just so that I
could have that effective of,

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:24.420
isn't he amazing?

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:26.970
Look at how exceptional
this guy is.

00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:29.780
I really needed to be
exceptional because who I was

00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:30.874
wasn't OK with me.

00:30:30.874 --> 00:30:32.665
Now somebody who is
much more well adjusted

00:30:32.665 --> 00:30:36.440
than that shows up and
if they bowl a 27 it's

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:40.220
just like I bowled a 27,
because they are actually OK.

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:42.740
They don't hold this
belief necessarily

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:47.330
that my performance defines
my worth as who I am.

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:48.720
So you guys get that?

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.180
And this is
underneath the scenes.

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:53.305
You could have listened to
that first visualization

00:30:53.305 --> 00:30:55.388
and thought to yourself
none of this is really me.

00:30:55.388 --> 00:30:56.610
I don't do these things.

00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:57.780
It's not going on like that.

00:30:57.780 --> 00:30:59.863
But so much of this is
happening in the background

00:30:59.863 --> 00:31:01.730
and we can't even really see it.

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:04.620
So where does inherent
self worth come from?

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:07.140
Well, obviously maybe a
safer environment growing up,

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:09.160
maybe good parents,
maybe, maybe, maybe.

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:11.362
It certainly comes
from our core story.

00:31:11.362 --> 00:31:12.820
If I've got a core
story of I'm not

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:16.530
enough it's going to
be difficult to feel

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:18.540
really good about myself.

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:20.340
It also comes from
our meaning making.

00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:21.881
And we're going to
talk about meaning

00:31:21.881 --> 00:31:23.270
making in just a little bit.

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:26.000
And it basically comes from
our beliefs about ourself.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.715
What do we really truly believe
about who we are and how

00:31:28.715 --> 00:31:32.397
can we make who we are really,
really amazing exactly as we

00:31:32.397 --> 00:31:34.480
are, wherever we're kind
of coming in on the thing

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:36.930
so that we can actually show
up to do the things that feel

00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:38.820
most important to us.

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:41.110
So, again, you may be
thinking this isn't really me.

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:42.310
I don't have these issues.

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:46.174
But they may be more
pervasive than you think.

00:31:46.174 --> 00:31:48.340
And so I want to introduce
another idea to you guys.

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:50.923
I'm going to suggest that we've
actually been bred to believe.

00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:56.400
And I'm going to share a
story that I originally

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:57.940
from Michael Shermer.

00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:01.300
I want you to imagine
you're that hunter 1,000

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:03.050
years ago or 10,000
years ago or whatever.

00:32:03.050 --> 00:32:06.790
And you've actually this time
got a kill on your shoulder.

00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:10.940
And you have the food with you
and you're going down a path.

00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:13.200
And on the right is
like a shear wall.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:14.650
There's some cliff going up.

00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:16.060
So you can't go that way.

00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:17.170
And you're on a path.

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:19.240
And all you have is
this field of grass

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:20.890
over here on your left.

00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:24.090
And all of a sudden you
hear a rustle in the grass.

00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:26.710
And you wondered to yourself,
that could be a tiger

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:28.850
or that might just be the wind.

00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:32.080
So is it a tiger
or is it the wind?

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:33.330
Not sure.

00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:36.870
Well, it's a long
way back to camp.

00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:37.850
I got food here.

00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:39.780
Kind of important I
go deal with this.

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:43.050
And around the mountain
has got costs to it.

00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:45.410
There's basically two
ways to be wrong here.

00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:52.350
I can go the long way and it
was just wind and I overreacted.

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:55.590
Or I can go the short
way and it be the tiger

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:56.590
and I'm wrong that way.

00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:58.340
There's two ways
to be wrong here.

00:32:58.340 --> 00:32:59.030
You get it?

00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:03.310
But one error costs a whole
lot more than the other error.

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:05.560
So one way I might hurt myself.

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:06.530
The food might go bad.

00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:08.020
I might run into other trouble.

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:09.300
Whatever.

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:11.240
But if I'm wrong that
way I ran from wind

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:14.050
and probably I get back
and probably I keep living

00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:16.150
and probably I continue
to procreate and do

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:17.430
whatever I'm doing.

00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:20.422
But the other way
you lose your life.

00:33:20.422 --> 00:33:21.880
It's like, if I
thought it was wind

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:24.386
and it was really a saber
tooth tiger and I get eaten up,

00:33:24.386 --> 00:33:26.930
I kind of end right there.

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:28.180
So think about that.

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:31.710
Not only do my genes
not get forwarded,

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:36.080
but the memes-- my mental genes,
my teachings, my way of being,

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:39.180
my thoughts about the
world, my belief structure,

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:41.790
maybe any confidence that I had.

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:43.310
So it was incredibly safe.

00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:46.510
And over and over and over
again in examples like this

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:50.070
the ones who were
worried made it home.

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:50.820
They made it home.

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:52.060
They didn't take that risk.

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:53.969
And this is prevalent today.

00:33:53.969 --> 00:33:56.510
I'm living outside Detroit right
now in Birmingham, Michigan,

00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:57.730
but I'm from Philadelphia.

00:33:57.730 --> 00:34:01.192
And I used to see old lady
hooligans, which are really

00:34:01.192 --> 00:34:02.900
just people coming
back with a basketball

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:04.441
or something like
that, and she would

00:34:04.441 --> 00:34:07.090
go the long way like over
here and then she'd get home

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:10.900
and then she'd tell the story
of how she almost got killed.

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:12.440
It almost happened again.

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.569
And really she could
have done that 100 times

00:34:14.569 --> 00:34:15.610
and had nothing happened.

00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:19.780
But it's probably slightly
safer and she's certainly

00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:23.920
forwarding her genes and her
memes by doing that move.

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:27.840
So it was safe to believe
the fear, for sure.

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:32.199
And we are the offspring
of that process.

00:34:32.199 --> 00:34:34.639
Can we all get on
board with that?

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:37.389
And this works incredibly
well for survival.

00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:37.949
I'm curious.

00:34:37.949 --> 00:34:40.469
Does anyone here know
when the first year

00:34:40.469 --> 00:34:44.080
was that human beings
reached a billion

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:46.659
in population on planet Earth?

00:34:46.659 --> 00:34:49.570
I'll just let that hang and if
there's not any quick answers.

00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:50.570
When was it?

00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:51.510
AUDIENCE: 1900?

00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:52.176
ROB SCOTT: Yeah.

00:34:52.176 --> 00:34:54.045
It's a little
earlier, but not much.

00:34:54.045 --> 00:34:56.530
So it was 1804 actually
that it was the first time.

00:34:56.530 --> 00:34:59.630
And I'm shocked that you
were that close really.

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:01.990
Because to me I wouldn't
have guessed that at all.

00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:04.270
It feels like it had
to be longer than that.

00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:07.390
But it's been about
200 years since then

00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:10.572
and now we're about seven
times more than that.

00:35:10.572 --> 00:35:12.030
And the only reason
I bring that up

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:14.894
is that survival is
not the problem anymore

00:35:14.894 --> 00:35:15.560
in the same way.

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:18.760
We don't have that
problem in the same way.

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:21.350
So we do have beliefs though.

00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:23.920
We do have these kind
of demons of fear

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:25.930
and different ways
of looking at things.

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:29.314
And this leads to wars and
all kinds of other stuff.

00:35:29.314 --> 00:35:31.230
I would suggest that
understanding our beliefs

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:34.330
is a much bigger problem now.

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:37.850
So how often are we believing?

00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:40.080
Because people might go
well, I hold some beliefs.

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:43.500
I have my religious beliefs and
I've got this kind of belief

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:45.380
and I've got that kind
of belief going on.

00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:47.380
And we're talking about
limiting beliefs especially.

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:49.170
Those are the ones that we'd
really like to get out of here.

00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:50.711
But let's look at
beliefs in general.

00:35:50.711 --> 00:35:53.680
How often are we believing?

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:56.350
So I'll tell you a story
so we can try and put

00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:59.060
some gumption around this.

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:00.480
I want you to
imagine two really,

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:01.720
really attractive goldfish.

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:03.420
And they're enjoying the pond.

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:06.390
And they're cruising around
all sassy and enjoying the day

00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:08.410
and it's like, ho-hum,
ho-hum, what's up.

00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:09.120
How you doing?

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:14.450
And an older, wiser fish
swims by and asks, hey guys,

00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:17.125
how's the water?

00:36:17.125 --> 00:36:18.750
And two younger fish
look at each other

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:24.530
confused for a second and they
go, what the fuck is water?

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:25.850
What's he talking about water?

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:27.182
What is water?

00:36:27.182 --> 00:36:29.390
So the idea here is that
the fish can't see the water

00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:31.260
because it's their everything.

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:32.456
I haven't been a fish.

00:36:32.456 --> 00:36:33.330
They might see water.

00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:34.395
They might be like,
that's air up there.

00:36:34.395 --> 00:36:35.060
This is water.

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:35.560
Whatever.

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:38.337
However, for this we're
going to kind of get

00:36:38.337 --> 00:36:40.170
the idea that they're
swimming in the water.

00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:41.410
So it's their whole reality.

00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:45.451
So they have no context
of what water is or isn't.

00:36:45.451 --> 00:36:45.950
Right?

00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:47.076
It's their whole reality.

00:36:47.076 --> 00:36:49.200
Well, there's something
that we can't see, as well.

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:51.760
Something that we're swimming
in constantly they we're

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:53.800
not really awake to.

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.770
And that is meaning.

00:36:55.770 --> 00:37:00.090
We are constantly making up
meaning as we go through life.

00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:04.490
We're literally
swimming in meaning.

00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:09.630
So my boss looked at me funny,
that means she doesn't like me.

00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:11.060
I see horrible
things on the news,

00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:14.070
that means the world is unsafe.

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:16.010
The new hot shot got hired.

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:19.900
That means I'm going
to be forgotten.

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:21.690
At our current level
of consciousness,

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:24.700
we make up meaning constantly.

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:27.130
It's actually like the
world that you're living in

00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:30.430
is a construction
of your meaning.

00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:34.140
So you're believing
all the time.

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:36.240
It's not just the
occasional limiting belief,

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:39.049
although I could probably
find 10 hot buttons or three

00:37:39.049 --> 00:37:41.590
hot buttons for any one of you
and make a profound difference

00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:42.131
in your life.

00:37:42.131 --> 00:37:43.960
But there's an engine
of belief making,

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:46.020
of meaning making,
happening all the time.

00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:47.520
And we do it unconsciously.

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:51.080
And sadly often we
do it negatively.

00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:53.990
Your meaning in any
moment is your belief.

00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.826
Now, why is that?

00:37:54.826 --> 00:37:56.450
Why am I so sure that
I could say that?

00:37:56.450 --> 00:37:58.490
Because the meaning
of belief is this--

00:37:58.490 --> 00:38:01.030
it's an assuredness of meaning.

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:02.810
My boss looked at
me with funny eyes,

00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:05.610
I know she doesn't like me.

00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:06.610
I know it.

00:38:06.610 --> 00:38:07.640
It's what it means.

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:10.710
I'm believing that
in that moment.

00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:14.440
And the meaning that you create
creates absolutely everything

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:16.730
in your life.

00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:19.590
Creates whether
you think you can

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:21.300
have a certain success
along this line

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:22.979
or whether you can
build a big business

00:38:22.979 --> 00:38:24.270
or whether you can do whatever.

00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:27.369
The meaning you create, if you
keep carrying, I'm not enough,

00:38:27.369 --> 00:38:29.160
if you keep carrying,
people don't like me,

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:31.380
if you keep carrying
I'm not attractive,

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:33.440
that's going to affect
to a great degree

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:36.180
everything in your life.

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:38.060
Meaning creates
your very identity,

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:39.980
who you think you are.

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:43.470
Your story of yourself.

00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:45.720
So looking at it in
that light, shouldn't we

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:47.590
learn to master our meaning?

00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:52.170
Wouldn't it be helpful if
we could master our meaning?

00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:54.660
I'm going to teach you
another little idea here.

00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:57.780
I want to go into
belief as an error.

00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:00.280
So I'm just saying it's kind
of like all belief pretty much.

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:03.050
We're making up meaning
all of the time.

00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:04.840
And then I'm going to
call that an error.

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:07.244
And I'm going to mean
it really sincerely.

00:39:07.244 --> 00:39:08.660
I want to talk
about three things.

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:10.770
I want to talk about
truth, opinion, and belief.

00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:14.470
If we could just kind of slice
up the world into some chunks

00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:15.615
here, OK?

00:39:15.615 --> 00:39:16.380
Truth.

00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:17.879
I'm going to hope
that you can agree

00:39:17.879 --> 00:39:19.550
with me that truth is weird.

00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:21.900
We think we kind of
have access to truth,

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:24.380
but this has really become
a philosophical debate

00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:25.880
on what is true.

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:29.230
And there's always
this kind of parachute

00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:31.440
out of the conversation if
philosophers got together

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:31.740
about this.

00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:33.490
Well, all of this
could just be a dream.

00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:35.340
We could wake up in
some other reality.

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:36.680
And that might be true.

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:37.380
That's great.

00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:39.066
But if we really start
to chunk it down,

00:39:39.066 --> 00:39:40.440
there is certainly
the difference

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:44.160
between subjective truth
and objective truth.

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:46.170
There's a useful truth
that we can agree on

00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:48.580
at like what time it
is and what happened,

00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:51.490
but as soon as something happens
and it goes back in the past,

00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:54.130
it sort of gets further
from us, and then we

00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:55.666
need to depend on
stories about it.

00:39:55.666 --> 00:39:57.540
And if we think about
how history is written,

00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:58.998
usually the winners
are writing it.

00:39:58.998 --> 00:40:01.910
And so what really
happened we don't always

00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:03.720
have great access to that.

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:05.730
And subjectively I
would say that it's

00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:07.820
very true to kind of be
in touch in the moment

00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:10.220
with how you feel, but, again,
as soon as you report on

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:11.560
that then it becomes a history.

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:13.101
And the truth of it
kind of goes away

00:40:13.101 --> 00:40:15.849
and it needs to turn into
a story of some sort.

00:40:15.849 --> 00:40:17.390
And then there's
the amount of truth.

00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:19.940
If we say this is happening,
like my truth is all you

00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:22.510
guys now, your truth is
me, not the same thing,

00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:24.970
but we would all say it
happened and it was true.

00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:28.870
So let's just agree that there
are absolutely useful truths

00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:30.840
and there are some
maybe absolute truths,

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:32.310
but truth is weird.

00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:35.930
And it's a lot harder to kind of
get our finger on than maybe we

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:37.690
thought about before this.

00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:40.400
If that's not clear, I could go
deeper into that, but trust me,

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:41.040
truth is weird.

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:44.110
It's very hard because we're
perceiving and our perception

00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:45.384
kind of effects truth.

00:40:45.384 --> 00:40:46.800
And so there's a
weird dance there

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:49.680
that we're not
totally in control of.

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:51.320
Then there's opinion.

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:52.770
Opinion is pretty awesome.

00:40:52.770 --> 00:40:54.700
Opinion is pretty healthy.

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:57.174
Imagine I'm one of the first
people and I'm walking around

00:40:57.174 --> 00:40:59.590
and there's a tree and I bump
into the tree and it really,

00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:00.610
really hurts.

00:41:00.610 --> 00:41:02.570
Totally healthy for
me to have the opinion

00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:05.140
that bumping into
the tree was bad.

00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:06.830
And I can say that's my thing.

00:41:06.830 --> 00:41:09.440
And these lead to cultures.

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:11.315
Opinions are our own
special preference.

00:41:11.315 --> 00:41:12.720
It's some of the stuff
that I want to know

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:13.850
about you if I get to know you.

00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:14.710
Or what are your opinions?

00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:15.660
How do you see the world?

00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:16.440
What's happening?

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:18.420
So opinions seem
very, very safe,

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:19.980
but when we start
to take opinions

00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:22.550
too far-- when that guy who
bumped the tree goes back

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:26.530
to his village and starts going,
bumping trees is bad and so

00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:28.315
we're not going to
ever bump trees.

00:41:28.315 --> 00:41:29.940
And that goes even
further to the point

00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:32.720
that anybody who bumps
trees is a lunatic

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:35.720
and we need to kill
them on some level.

00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:38.610
Until that guy's walking and
he finds the other place that

00:41:38.610 --> 00:41:40.330
bumped into trees and
found the value out

00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:42.960
of training by kicking
trees and they're all strong

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:44.460
and now we have a war.

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:46.419
It's like bumping trees is bad.

00:41:46.419 --> 00:41:47.460
Kicking trees is amazing.

00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:48.585
What are you talking about?

00:41:48.585 --> 00:41:50.709
And now we're literally
like firing, right?

00:41:50.709 --> 00:41:51.750
Now, what happened there?

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:52.990
It's no longer an opinion.

00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:54.490
It's no longer
something I'm holding

00:41:54.490 --> 00:41:56.156
that's a preference
of mine or something

00:41:56.156 --> 00:41:58.690
that I think is smart but I'm
open to another discussion,

00:41:58.690 --> 00:42:03.150
it has solidified into a belief,
an assuredness of meaning.

00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:05.230
Kicking trees is lunacy.

00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:06.551
What are you doing?

00:42:06.551 --> 00:42:07.800
Please cut it out immediately.

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:09.620
Nobody should do that.

00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:12.000
And so what happens
is that opinions

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.760
start to move toward
feeling like truth.

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:17.130
They start to cruise
over and all of a sudden

00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:19.560
they get kind of overtaken
mixed with all that.

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:21.760
And all of a sudden the
opinion part goes away

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:24.170
and all we have is a
big, healthy belief

00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:27.180
that feels like truth.

00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:30.355
And don't mistake it, our
believes feel like truth to us.

00:42:30.355 --> 00:42:32.730
A lot of times we talk about
religious beliefs and things

00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:34.750
like that and it's something
we're consciously choosing

00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:35.833
and we know it's a belief.

00:42:35.833 --> 00:42:37.840
But most of the meaning
making that we're doing

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:40.094
is an assuredness of meaning.

00:42:40.094 --> 00:42:41.510
And it's important
that we do that

00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:43.718
or we'd be walking around
kind of doubting everything

00:42:43.718 --> 00:42:46.425
and it'd be very difficult.
Like we've got to kind of ground

00:42:46.425 --> 00:42:47.440
in this.

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:51.040
So just be clear, our
beliefs feel true to us.

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:53.320
I've had clients come to
me and they say, no, Rob,

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:54.490
I am a loser.

00:42:54.490 --> 00:42:55.520
You don't understand.

00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:56.230
I lost this.

00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:56.730
I lost that.

00:42:56.730 --> 00:42:57.560
I lost all my money.

00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:58.226
I lost the girl.

00:42:58.226 --> 00:43:00.240
I lost da, da, da,
da, da, da, da.

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:03.594
And I'm like great, I don't
care at all about any of that

00:43:03.594 --> 00:43:05.260
because even if you
have evidence of it,

00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:06.704
it's not useful.

00:43:06.704 --> 00:43:07.370
It's not useful.

00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:10.090
And if you plan to change,
we better put down you

00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:13.470
holding on to this
idea of that truth

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:15.385
because it's not really true.

00:43:15.385 --> 00:43:16.890
Not if you're capable of change.

00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:18.789
It's not an absolute
permanent thing.

00:43:18.789 --> 00:43:20.080
It's just been your experience.

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:21.746
But because you're
making it your story,

00:43:21.746 --> 00:43:24.330
it's becoming more true for you.

00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:26.350
So our beliefs feel true to us.

00:43:26.350 --> 00:43:29.670
So remember they're an
assuredness of meaning

00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:31.940
and that the error here
is that we're treating

00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:33.650
an opinion like a truth.

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:36.200
We've lost access to
knowing which is an opinion

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:38.080
and which is a truth.

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:40.130
This is actually
dangerous and delusional.

00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:42.360
Every war that's
ever been fought,

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:46.540
every punch that's ever been
thrown has been over a belief.

00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:48.220
It's been an
attachment of meaning

00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:50.090
that my way is the
right way and then

00:43:50.090 --> 00:43:53.110
I have to go hurt you about it.

00:43:53.110 --> 00:43:55.280
So in the same breath
that I say that, beliefs

00:43:55.280 --> 00:44:01.130
themselves aren't the problem
because we make meaning

00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:02.890
and we have beliefs
kind of all the time.

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:05.540
The problem is being
unaware of our beliefs.

00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:08.180
The problem is that we can't
see that we're carrying them,

00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:10.365
so they've kind of
stopped into truth.

00:44:10.365 --> 00:44:11.740
So maybe it'd be
more true for me

00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:15.220
to say opinions, even strong
opinions, aren't the problem,

00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:17.590
but as soon as we start
making that error of belief

00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:19.510
we have an issue.

00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:22.440
So mastery of our beliefs
of our meaning making

00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:24.670
is actually the solution.

00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:27.290
If we can master this meaning
making, become aware of it

00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:31.050
in a different way, we have
a total different access

00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:31.590
to things.

00:44:31.590 --> 00:44:33.510
So how do we fix this?

00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:36.190
We fix this by understanding
an idea about lenses, just

00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:37.190
simple lenses.

00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:39.237
And I see a bunch of
people wearing glasses.

00:44:39.237 --> 00:44:40.820
Some of you might
have contact lenses.

00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:42.528
If you haven't had
experience with those,

00:44:42.528 --> 00:44:45.070
you've certainly looked through
a microscope or a telescope.

00:44:45.070 --> 00:44:48.924
And I want to ask you, what is
the main function of a lens?

00:44:48.924 --> 00:44:50.210
AUDIENCE: Distort reality.

00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:50.918
ROB SCOTT: Right.

00:44:50.918 --> 00:44:53.050
It's to alter what we see.

00:44:53.050 --> 00:44:54.530
And it might make it more clear.

00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:55.700
It might make it closer up.

00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:57.160
It might make it blurry.

00:44:57.160 --> 00:45:01.050
But the literal function of a
lense is to alter what we see.

00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:03.026
It's what it's built for.

00:45:03.026 --> 00:45:04.650
But there's another
function of a lense

00:45:04.650 --> 00:45:07.410
that we often don't think about.

00:45:07.410 --> 00:45:10.620
And it's not just in
our awareness at all.

00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:13.110
It's that lenses are
built to be invisible.

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:15.780
Lenses themself don't
function as well

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:18.720
if I have raindrops on my
glasses or scratches on them,

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:21.021
or if I even just take
them off and consider them

00:45:21.021 --> 00:45:22.020
they don't work as well.

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:24.210
They're built to be
looked through so

00:45:24.210 --> 00:45:27.150
that I can get into the
altering of whatever I'm

00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:29.230
supposed to see through them.

00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:32.230
So lenses they alter and
they're built to be invisible

00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:33.390
themselves.

00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:36.505
Well, our thoughts and
our beliefs are lenses.

00:45:39.001 --> 00:45:40.750
I want you to just
grab that for a second.

00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:43.530
Our thoughts and our
belief are simply lenses.

00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:46.940
And like any good lenses,
they're built to be invisible.

00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:50.124
And these lenses alter the
meaning of the world to us.

00:45:50.124 --> 00:45:51.540
So whatever lenses
we're carrying.

00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:55.390
If you had the parental you're
horrible, you're horrible,

00:45:55.390 --> 00:45:57.990
you're horrible, you may
get the I'm horrible lense

00:45:57.990 --> 00:46:01.190
and your life will be dealing
with the I'm horrible lense.

00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:04.560
If you suddenly had friends
that were different and cool

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:07.160
than you in some way and they
had hurtful things or somebody

00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:09.270
called you fat once
when you were younger,

00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:11.200
you start to get that lense.

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:14.460
And so we start to see the
whole world through that lense.

00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:16.670
Just like our core
story, we can stack

00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:19.690
tons of these on top of each
other and make up, what?

00:46:19.690 --> 00:46:20.587
Make up our identity.

00:46:20.587 --> 00:46:21.420
So think about this.

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:24.250
Think about like a die
hard Republican over here

00:46:24.250 --> 00:46:26.162
who's like, those
people are crazy.

00:46:26.162 --> 00:46:27.120
What are they thinking?

00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:30.870
And then you have the die
hard Democrat over here

00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:32.580
who are sure that they're right.

00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:35.730
They literally can't understand
how the other one can see it

00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:36.230
differently.

00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:37.250
Well, what's different?

00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:38.958
They're looking through
different lenses.

00:46:38.958 --> 00:46:42.330
They're just simply looking
through different lenses.

00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:44.870
So pro-choice versus pro-life.

00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:46.400
Different lenses.

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:48.580
Omnivore versus vegan.

00:46:48.580 --> 00:46:50.230
Different lenses.

00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:53.390
Christianity versus
Islam versus Judaism.

00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:54.470
Different lenses.

00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:57.320
Where did we get them?

00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:57.870
Our parents.

00:46:57.870 --> 00:46:59.020
Our culture.

00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:00.240
What our friends think.

00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:02.770
This makes up our lenses.

00:47:02.770 --> 00:47:06.940
And as we stack up these
different lenses in our life,

00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:09.790
they make up our whole
meaning, our whole everything,

00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:11.975
in fact our whole self
concept about who we are

00:47:11.975 --> 00:47:14.300
and what's possible for us.

00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:14.960
What we can do.

00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:16.750
What we can and
can't do, et cetera.

00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:18.850
And so as we stack
all these lenses,

00:47:18.850 --> 00:47:21.170
all these different ways of
seeing ourselves and seeing

00:47:21.170 --> 00:47:21.670
others.

00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:24.720
Those purple people are bad
and yellow people are good

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:27.730
and mauve people
are whatever, how

00:47:27.730 --> 00:47:31.300
clearly are we seeing when
we're kind of stacking up all

00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:34.670
these different views on life?

00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:36.950
We're not really
looking at truth.

00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:39.050
We're looking
through these lenses.

00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:43.670
So the fundamental shift
that I promised you guys.

00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:46.080
This is what I want
to offer you guys

00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:49.580
as a shortcut to getting
to the next level

00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:51.880
in your own life in some way.

00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:54.230
Instead of blindly looking
through our lenses,

00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:57.156
instead of just going
through all those lenses

00:47:57.156 --> 00:47:59.780
and being unaware of it because
we're not even aware that we're

00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:02.544
doing it most of the time,
we need to actually--

00:48:02.544 --> 00:48:03.960
and here's the
fundamental shift--

00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:06.894
we need to shift from
looking through our lenses

00:48:06.894 --> 00:48:08.310
to move the frame
of our awareness

00:48:08.310 --> 00:48:10.830
back to see our
lenses, to actually

00:48:10.830 --> 00:48:14.170
consider how am I seeing.

00:48:14.170 --> 00:48:17.852
So it's an invitation to go,
I feel like this is true,

00:48:17.852 --> 00:48:19.560
but how can I investigate
the truth of it

00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:21.660
by looking at how I'm seeing.

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:24.450
Because without this
awareness our limits

00:48:24.450 --> 00:48:25.832
seem like truth to us.

00:48:25.832 --> 00:48:26.790
They just seem factual.

00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:28.230
I am a loser.

00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:29.420
This will never work out.

00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:31.510
I'll never get that job.

00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:32.474
She will never date me.

00:48:32.474 --> 00:48:33.390
He will never date me.

00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:35.420
This will never work out.

00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:36.770
People don't really like me.

00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:38.940
I'm unattractive.

00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:42.125
They feel like true to us unless
we investigate them and look

00:48:42.125 --> 00:48:45.660
and go, what am I
looking through here.

00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:48.050
I'm here to tell you that
your mind is lying to you.

00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:50.620
It's making up
meaning constantly

00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:52.890
and it's making up meaning
that at one time probably

00:48:52.890 --> 00:48:55.850
kept you safe and was
useful in that moment,

00:48:55.850 --> 00:48:57.350
but then you built
a story around it

00:48:57.350 --> 00:49:00.130
and you carried it
further and it has created

00:49:00.130 --> 00:49:01.589
the limits of your life.

00:49:01.589 --> 00:49:03.130
And your limits
might be really high.

00:49:03.130 --> 00:49:04.180
You guys might be incredible.

00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:05.240
Huge houses and all that.

00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:06.487
But why not even more?

00:49:06.487 --> 00:49:07.320
Why not even bigger?

00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:09.670
Why is that the
level of comfort?

00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:11.350
Why is wherever you
are in the company

00:49:11.350 --> 00:49:12.440
kind of where you landed?

00:49:14.671 --> 00:49:15.920
Because of your self identity.

00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:18.110
It's because of your lenses.

00:49:18.110 --> 00:49:21.482
So if you remember
this slide I told

00:49:21.482 --> 00:49:23.190
that there was going
to be one place that

00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:24.800
was going to change the game.

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:28.040
Right here is where we
make a fundamental shift.

00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:31.770
Right here is where we start
to become aware of our lenses.

00:49:31.770 --> 00:49:33.880
And so these events
that come in, instead

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:36.886
of just not changing how
we see and just like work,

00:49:36.886 --> 00:49:38.610
work, work, work to
get different events,

00:49:38.610 --> 00:49:41.790
how can we actually
really become

00:49:41.790 --> 00:49:45.390
elevated in how we
understand how we're seeing?

00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:48.750
So events come in and we
can now master our meaning

00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:50.700
making to a great degree.

00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:54.189
And as we do that, we can affect
the states that we experience.

00:49:54.189 --> 00:49:55.980
As we affect the states
that we experience,

00:49:55.980 --> 00:49:57.900
that influences our behavior.

00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:00.610
As our behavior changes,
our events change.

00:50:00.610 --> 00:50:01.610
And then we can do this.

00:50:01.610 --> 00:50:05.690
And this is a virtuous cycle
that stars to exponentially

00:50:05.690 --> 00:50:07.840
grow as we do this.

00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:09.340
It's not just one change.

00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:14.930
It can become a way to
change iteratively over time.

00:50:14.930 --> 00:50:19.670
So ultimately we want
to master our meaning.

00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:21.250
We want to become
aware that we're

00:50:21.250 --> 00:50:24.330
playing this game
of meaning creation

00:50:24.330 --> 00:50:27.510
and start to be able
to edit our thoughts.

00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:30.830
Start to check in-- is
that thought helpful to me,

00:50:30.830 --> 00:50:32.420
or is it holding me
back in some way?

00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:34.750
Instead of just
believing the thought,

00:50:34.750 --> 00:50:37.250
we can actually begin
to edit our thoughts.

00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:38.930
So to do this we need
to actually begin

00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:41.890
to challenge our
interpretations, our truths.

00:50:41.890 --> 00:50:44.560
We need to actually challenge
the things that come up

00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:46.380
for us, because
if we don't, we're

00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:49.810
believing a very biased,
fear-based machine that's

00:50:49.810 --> 00:50:51.397
doing great at survival.

00:50:51.397 --> 00:50:53.480
You can keep your small
house and keep your limits

00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:58.350
and not talk to them and do all
this stuff and you'll survive.

00:50:58.350 --> 00:51:01.220
You'll even procreate maybe and
do whatever you do that way,

00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:04.050
but you may not thrive
in the same way.

00:51:04.050 --> 00:51:06.980
So sadly that's what
most of us are stuck in.

00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:08.390
Most of us are blind to this.

00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:09.639
We're stuck in our own limits.

00:51:09.639 --> 00:51:11.660
We don't know how
to get out of that.

00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:14.290
So the power of this
begins to fix the world

00:51:14.290 --> 00:51:17.160
because it removes this
delusion that leaders

00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:19.530
of state and leaders of
companies and all that stuff

00:51:19.530 --> 00:51:20.140
suffer.

00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:23.090
So we actually evolve
our consciousness.

00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:26.320
This is actually an evolution
in our consciousness.

00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:28.330
So I realize we're
coming up on time.

00:51:28.330 --> 00:51:30.090
I'm going to speed
up a little bit here.

00:51:30.090 --> 00:51:32.298
Are you guys interested in
a simple three-step system

00:51:32.298 --> 00:51:33.560
to tangibly do this?

00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:34.890
Does this make sense to you?

00:51:34.890 --> 00:51:35.390
Yeah?

00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:35.710
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:51:35.710 --> 00:51:36.610
ROB SCOTT: Awesome.

00:51:36.610 --> 00:51:38.220
So really, really fast.

00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:41.370
LCR-- Look, Challenge,
and Replace.

00:51:41.370 --> 00:51:44.550
Step one is to look.

00:51:44.550 --> 00:51:47.380
If you were to actually sit
down and do this with me,

00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:49.494
we would actually sit
down and go-- put down

00:51:49.494 --> 00:51:51.160
that it's 100% true,
but just write down

00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:52.550
any kind of negative
thoughts that you have.

00:51:52.550 --> 00:51:53.820
Like give me a list of them.

00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:54.903
Well, I'm not really this.

00:51:54.903 --> 00:51:57.380
And it takes honesty and it
takes really looking at stuff

00:51:57.380 --> 00:51:59.213
that we would normally
bounce off of and not

00:51:59.213 --> 00:52:02.860
want to deal with, but
you find your limits.

00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:05.330
And, again, we can do
this in a big process

00:52:05.330 --> 00:52:07.639
or you can do it
as you see them.

00:52:07.639 --> 00:52:10.180
If you learn how to do this,
you can just do it, you see one,

00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:11.132
and you can switch it.

00:52:11.132 --> 00:52:12.840
If I go to the party
and I feel separate,

00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:15.397
I can go, wait, how about I just
connect with how connected I

00:52:15.397 --> 00:52:16.480
am to all of these people.

00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:18.580
Even if it's just
because you're human.

00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:20.490
Or maybe it's because
we're all at Google.

00:52:20.490 --> 00:52:24.450
Or maybe it's because whatever,
just that change in that moment

00:52:24.450 --> 00:52:26.040
changes the game.

00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:28.940
Awareness itself is curative.

00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:32.230
If we become aware of it, it
can't affect us negatively

00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:34.150
without us seeing it.

00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:37.760
So step one by itself
can be largely curative.

00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:40.330
Step two is once you know
the negative thought that's

00:52:40.330 --> 00:52:42.410
going on-- and, again,
this could be in a process

00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:43.380
where you're dealing
with a lot of them

00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:46.270
and making a huge change, or it
could be as they kind of occur

00:52:46.270 --> 00:52:47.997
to you-- challenge it.

00:52:47.997 --> 00:52:48.830
Challenge the story.

00:52:48.830 --> 00:52:51.730
Decide to debate it.

00:52:51.730 --> 00:52:55.910
I'm not good at this, just
go, maybe I'm good at this.

00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:56.810
This won't work out.

00:52:56.810 --> 00:52:58.810
Maybe this will work out.

00:52:58.810 --> 00:53:00.980
It's literally as
simple as that.

00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:04.470
It's having the awareness to go,
what am I thinking right now?

00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:05.620
Is that useful?

00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:08.790
And is there a better
thought I could be having?

00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:11.850
Simply try the opposite idea.

00:53:11.850 --> 00:53:14.400
Now there is subtlety to this,
and when I work with people--

00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:15.940
it's not like I
am a millionaire.

00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:16.580
I am a million.

00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:17.690
That's not useful.

00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:19.140
You're subconscious is
going to go, no you're not.

00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:20.264
What are you talking about?

00:53:20.264 --> 00:53:22.730
But I love growing my money.

00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:23.340
Really useful.

00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:26.170
Instead of, I never have
money, or this won't work out.

00:53:26.170 --> 00:53:28.244
So last one is to replace.

00:53:28.244 --> 00:53:29.910
So obviously we're
going to challenge it

00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:31.330
and then is there
a positive thing

00:53:31.330 --> 00:53:33.440
we could actually anchor in?

00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:35.430
Again, simply moving
your focus in the moment

00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:38.570
is massively effective for this.

00:53:38.570 --> 00:53:40.256
But we can also
place new truths.

00:53:40.256 --> 00:53:41.880
This is what I do
working with clients.

00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:44.360
There's a way to kind of get
these into your subconscious.

00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:46.420
If you have I'm not good
enough, we can actually

00:53:46.420 --> 00:53:48.310
kind of re-pattern that.

00:53:48.310 --> 00:53:50.020
We can re-pattern
your subconscious

00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:54.680
with fundamentally more useful,
helpful ideas about yourself

00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:55.580
and about the world.

00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:57.900
So it's as simple as LCR.

00:53:57.900 --> 00:54:01.960
Look-- take the time to
look at what you're doing.

00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:02.734
Challenge it.

00:54:02.734 --> 00:54:03.400
That's not true.

00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:03.986
Wait a second.

00:54:03.986 --> 00:54:04.819
Let me look at that.

00:54:04.819 --> 00:54:06.217
That's not useful.

00:54:06.217 --> 00:54:07.050
And then replace it.

00:54:07.050 --> 00:54:09.740
Put something in that's good.

00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:11.310
I can kind of
cruise through here

00:54:11.310 --> 00:54:12.880
because I know we're
sort of at time,

00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:16.410
but there are other paths
as well that can do this.

00:54:16.410 --> 00:54:19.220
Any awareness practice
will be beneficial here.

00:54:19.220 --> 00:54:19.960
Why?

00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:22.050
Because we're starting
to play with thoughts.

00:54:22.050 --> 00:54:24.220
We're starting to watch am
I attached to the thought

00:54:24.220 --> 00:54:27.480
and caught, or can I abandon
the thought and come back.

00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:28.880
Can I drop it and come back.

00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:31.366
The benefits of
meditation are many.

00:54:31.366 --> 00:54:33.240
In the interest of time
I won't go into this,

00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:35.750
but almost anything
valuable in your life

00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:37.200
involves delaying gratification.

00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:40.205
Having the willpower to
not be instantly like,

00:54:40.205 --> 00:54:41.580
I'm just going to
have the sugar,

00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:44.204
or I'm going to drink the drink
because I can't control myself,

00:54:44.204 --> 00:54:47.210
or I'm going to go touch
that because she's pretty,

00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:47.930
or whatever.

00:54:47.930 --> 00:54:51.020
We got to slow it
down a little bit.

00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:53.470
And every time we delay
gratification, instead of sugar

00:54:53.470 --> 00:54:55.221
you eat broccoli,
longer term in your life

00:54:55.221 --> 00:54:56.803
it starts looking
much better for you.

00:54:56.803 --> 00:54:58.550
Instead of spending
your check every time

00:54:58.550 --> 00:55:01.560
you get it, if you invest it, it
starts looking better for you.

00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:04.145
And so there's this quality
of delayed gratification

00:55:04.145 --> 00:55:05.770
that if you start an
awareness practice

00:55:05.770 --> 00:55:07.680
and work with your
mind, what ends up

00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:10.300
happening for you is you
actually strengthen the part.

00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:12.410
Because every time
you put down a thought

00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:15.210
and come back-- because
the instant gratification

00:55:15.210 --> 00:55:16.490
is following the thought.

00:55:16.490 --> 00:55:18.450
The instant gratification
is going with it.

00:55:18.450 --> 00:55:22.230
And if you drop it and come
back to presence or your breath,

00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:23.110
you're doing a rep.

00:55:23.110 --> 00:55:24.026
You're doing a muscle.

00:55:24.026 --> 00:55:26.170
Literally they've shown
strengthening the mind so

00:55:26.170 --> 00:55:28.560
that everywhere else in
your life it becomes easier

00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:32.185
to delay gratification and stay
wise, stay on the path of what

00:55:32.185 --> 00:55:33.560
you really do want
to do and what

00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:36.110
you don't want to do
instead of being impulsive.

00:55:36.110 --> 00:55:39.312
So this hugely and quickly
helps with habit building.

00:55:39.312 --> 00:55:41.520
The other thing that I want
to mention before we wrap

00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:46.880
is that your thoughts and your
mind are built to be invisible.

00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:48.580
So I want you to
notice your emotions

00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:51.630
because as our thoughts
are built to be invisible,

00:55:51.630 --> 00:55:54.667
what's not invisible
to us is how we feel.

00:55:54.667 --> 00:55:56.500
Remember the meaning
that we're making leads

00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:58.360
to a state experience for us.

00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:03.120
So if you are depressed,
edit your meaning making.

00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:05.320
Emotions come from the
meaning making that we do.

00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:07.630
So your emotions will
always be telling you

00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:10.530
when it's a good time to
challenge your thinking.

00:56:10.530 --> 00:56:15.810
And so basically when you feel
crappy check your thinking.

00:56:15.810 --> 00:56:19.070
Go back to that and edit how
you're looking at the world.

00:56:19.070 --> 00:56:20.160
So let's wrap this up.

00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:21.390
What we've covered.

00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:23.350
You learned a little
bit more about me.

00:56:23.350 --> 00:56:26.260
You learned the cost
of limiting beliefs.

00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:28.510
We looked at core story.

00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:31.040
We looked at the formula--
self worth equals ability

00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:32.390
which equals performance.

00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:35.530
We went deep into truth,
opinion, and belief.

00:56:35.530 --> 00:56:39.180
And hopefully you now understand
meaning making in your lenses.

00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:41.990
And you understand
this awareness shift.

00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:44.400
This just becoming aware of
how we're making meaning,

00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:47.900
bringing the focus
back to the lenses,

00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:49.660
what we're doing so
that you can master

00:56:49.660 --> 00:56:50.743
all your limiting beliefs.

00:56:50.743 --> 00:56:53.180
You can put them down
and make other choices.

00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:55.130
So what would
change in your life

00:56:55.130 --> 00:56:58.390
if you'd just change one
persistent negative belief?

00:56:58.390 --> 00:57:01.125
Probably quite a bit.

00:57:01.125 --> 00:57:03.000
What would change in
your life if you started

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:06.210
being able to optimize
your thinking consistently

00:57:06.210 --> 00:57:07.104
and on the fly?

00:57:07.104 --> 00:57:08.520
One little change
after one little

00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:09.860
change after one little change.

00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:11.090
It's a whole new life.

00:57:11.090 --> 00:57:13.280
It's a whole new way of being.

00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:15.907
So this is a simple shift in
the evolution of consciousness.

00:57:15.907 --> 00:57:17.990
If we're blind and just
looking through our lenses

00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:19.962
without even knowing it,
that's a certain level

00:57:19.962 --> 00:57:20.670
of consciousness.

00:57:20.670 --> 00:57:23.310
And then if we develop
the awareness to do this,

00:57:23.310 --> 00:57:26.910
it's literally a shift
in consciousness.

00:57:26.910 --> 00:57:31.460
So raise your hand if you
learned anything useful today?

00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:32.720
Beautiful.

00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:33.400
Beautiful.

00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:34.250
Yay.

00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:36.470
So, thank you so very
much for this time.

00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:37.900
It's really great
to be with you.

00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:39.050
I appreciate it.

00:57:39.050 --> 00:57:40.310

this topic specifically

00:57:48.241 --> 00:57:49.740
coming soon at
identityshifting.com.

00:57:52.810 --> 00:57:53.790
And thanks for staying.

00:57:53.790 --> 00:57:55.350
I think we're a
couple minutes over.

00:57:55.350 --> 00:57:56.760
But if anybody
has any questions,

00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:58.530
I'm happy to stay
for a little bit.

00:57:58.530 --> 00:58:01.680
AUDIENCE: The people
that you worked with,

00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:04.880
how often are they aware of
what their self limiting beliefs

00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:07.767
are versus you sort of
helping them figure them out?

00:58:07.767 --> 00:58:08.600
ROB SCOTT: Not very.

00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:08.880
Not very.

00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:11.213
They might know some and they
might have inklings of it.

00:58:11.213 --> 00:58:14.200
But it's often not exactly
what they thought it was.

00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:17.390
So they're not always
in our consciousness

00:58:17.390 --> 00:58:20.260
because we're looking through
them instead of at them.

00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:23.470
And so I have a process to
help pull that out for people

00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:24.970
so that they can
kind of investigate

00:58:24.970 --> 00:58:27.880
these different dimensions of
their thinking and their life.

00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:30.280
And they often have
like a huge epiphany

00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:32.560
of like, wow, I didn't
see that at all,

00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:34.790
but that's been an
absolutely consistent theme

00:58:34.790 --> 00:58:35.700
throughout my life.

00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:37.420
And then when we
change that, there's

00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:39.892
a huge change in their life.

00:58:39.892 --> 00:58:42.290
Yeah.

00:58:42.290 --> 00:58:45.910
That actually speaks a
little bit to shadow work.

00:58:45.910 --> 00:58:48.110
Shadow is when we
kind of stuff things

00:58:48.110 --> 00:58:51.390
psychologically down that are
not OK for our self concept.

00:58:51.390 --> 00:58:54.070
And what ends up happening
is that we project those out

00:58:54.070 --> 00:58:55.160
on to other people.

00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:59.075
So we end up feeling like if
it's not OK for me to be angry,

00:58:59.075 --> 00:59:01.200
because maybe I was born
and I was supposed to turn

00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:02.366
the other cheek or whatever.

00:59:02.366 --> 00:59:05.010
And now I'm in a situation as an
adult and there is anger here,

00:59:05.010 --> 00:59:07.980
but it's not OK for me to be
angry, than someone else must

00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:08.480
be angry.

00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:11.232
So I actually start projecting
my anger on to other people.

00:59:11.232 --> 00:59:13.440
And what ends up happening
is that that will actually

00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:14.420
make someone mad.

00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:16.420
So before you know it,
they really will be angry

00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:18.650
and I will have proven
my little dance.

00:59:18.650 --> 00:59:20.660
And so we go through
life like that.

00:59:20.660 --> 00:59:24.230
What can actually happen is
you can go to therapy for 10

00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:28.470
years working on, let's say,
anxiety because you wake up

00:59:28.470 --> 00:59:31.040
out of dreams really,
really scared and anxious

00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:33.220
and you're working with
a therapist on confidence

00:59:33.220 --> 00:59:34.970
techniques and all
these different things,

00:59:34.970 --> 00:59:37.050
but the true emotion that
needs to be addressed

00:59:37.050 --> 00:59:38.966
is something that's
really in your shadow that

00:59:38.966 --> 00:59:42.500
might be rage that's showing
itself in dreams of yours that

00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:44.490
are like a big monster
that's coming at you.

00:59:44.490 --> 00:59:46.410
And it feels like I'm
just scared of monsters,

00:59:46.410 --> 00:59:49.240
but the reality is that nobody
else is in your dream but you,

00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:51.526
and that rage is
you in some way.

00:59:51.526 --> 00:59:53.400
And so it's just been
disassociated from you.

00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:54.980
And if you don't
address that, it

00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:56.750
doesn't really matter if
you address the other things

00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:59.000
on top of that because that
will just keep expressing.

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.150
So digging into people's
shadow and really seeing

01:00:01.150 --> 01:00:04.400
what the true, authentic
issue is with their psyche

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:06.615
is really, really important
to be able to do that.

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:12.020
AUDIENCE: Where do you
say the fine line is

01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:15.845
between not being impulsive
and not falling into a routine?

01:00:15.845 --> 01:00:17.720
ROB SCOTT: I'm not sure
I know what you mean.

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:19.886
So not being impulse and
not falling into a routine.

01:00:19.886 --> 01:00:21.560
AUDIENCE: As in like
you were describing

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:24.960
towards the end kind of--

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:27.460
ROB SCOTT: Instant gratification
and delaying gratification.

01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:28.084
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:00:28.084 --> 01:00:31.120
But at the same
time is there a time

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:35.070
where you would
kind of say to lean

01:00:35.070 --> 01:00:38.914
towards a sort of instant
gratification as long as--

01:00:38.914 --> 01:00:39.580
ROB SCOTT: Yeah.

01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:41.256
If you're annoyingly
anal, we're going

01:00:41.256 --> 01:00:42.880
to need you to loosen
up and just go do

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:44.470
some fun stuff or something.

01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:45.930
No, but what's
really going there

01:00:45.930 --> 01:00:48.254
is that's obviously a personal
decision for whoever's

01:00:48.254 --> 01:00:48.920
dealing with it.

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:52.430
And what we want to make sure
is that somebody to the level

01:00:52.430 --> 01:00:54.490
that they're satisfied
in control of their life.

01:00:54.490 --> 01:00:56.910
It's really fun to sometimes
just go do something.

01:00:56.910 --> 01:00:58.646
But if you're
compulsively doing things

01:00:58.646 --> 01:01:00.270
that you know are
bad for you-- I mean,

01:01:00.270 --> 01:01:02.090
human beings are
really the only species

01:01:02.090 --> 01:01:04.660
that I know of anyway
that consciously do

01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:05.960
things that are bad for them.

01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:08.360
Like we know working
out is better for us

01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:11.077
than eating the ice cream
and we eat the ice cream.

01:01:11.077 --> 01:01:13.410
Even though we've made a huge
declaration that we're not

01:01:13.410 --> 01:01:14.340
going to eat the ice cream.

01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:15.720
Even though we've
gone to a coach

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:17.190
and invested money
and time and effort

01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:18.460
in not eating the ice cream.

01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:19.800
We keep doing it.

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:21.730
We keep kind of choosing wrong.

01:01:21.730 --> 01:01:23.190
And so when that's
out of control

01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:25.710
for you, it's time
to tighten it up

01:01:25.710 --> 01:01:28.690
I would say and work
toward mastering

01:01:28.690 --> 01:01:30.070
delaying gratification.

01:01:30.070 --> 01:01:31.590
I have some
shortcuts about that.

01:01:31.590 --> 01:01:34.220
For most of us we're exhausted
with decision fatigue.

01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:37.330
We're dealing with choices
and communication level

01:01:37.330 --> 01:01:39.230
that we've never
had to as humans.

01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:41.690
And so we're almost
all in a constant state

01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:45.820
of overwhelm, shock, tiredness,
adrenal fatigue, whatever.

01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:46.980
There's some form of that.

01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:49.680
And so we're constantly
walking through our life

01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:52.370
looking at all our commitments
and going, I should do that.

01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:53.150
I should do that.

01:01:53.150 --> 01:01:55.030
I should have all
my taxes ready.

01:01:55.030 --> 01:01:56.650
All my emails should be zero.

01:01:56.650 --> 01:01:58.450
That pile, my wash
should be done.

01:01:58.450 --> 01:01:59.350
All that stuff.

01:01:59.350 --> 01:02:00.810
And we end up at
the end of our day

01:02:00.810 --> 01:02:03.010
feeling really bad because
we've made commitments

01:02:03.010 --> 01:02:05.800
and we've not shown up
for ourself in any way.

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:07.830
And if you had a friend
that was not showing up

01:02:07.830 --> 01:02:10.420
for dinner for you like
two or three times,

01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:13.220
you'd not trust them, not like
them, not invite them back.

01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:16.890
But for ourselves we continually
beat ourselves up about

01:02:16.890 --> 01:02:18.447
how we don't show
up for ourselves.

01:02:18.447 --> 01:02:20.030
So part of that
delaying gratification

01:02:20.030 --> 01:02:21.830
and like figuring
that out is really

01:02:21.830 --> 01:02:24.001
coming up with not
doing everything,

01:02:24.001 --> 01:02:25.750
because there's just
too many invitations.

01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:28.650
We need to start saying no to
a lot of stuff that is just

01:02:28.650 --> 01:02:30.622
too much, choosing the
handful of things--

01:02:30.622 --> 01:02:32.830
the three or four things--
that really, really matter

01:02:32.830 --> 01:02:33.660
that are game changers.

01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:35.243
You might call them
your bottom lines.

01:02:35.243 --> 01:02:36.790
These are super important to do.

01:02:36.790 --> 01:02:39.470
And then see if you can
play with creating behaviors

01:02:39.470 --> 01:02:41.640
around those that really
matter to you over time.

01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:43.473
And when you show up
like that for yourself,

01:02:43.473 --> 01:02:45.600
making better, more clear
agreements with yourself,

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:48.590
you end up having this deep
sense of self, confidence,

01:02:48.590 --> 01:02:50.840
and self love because you
are showing up for yourself.

01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:52.477
You are getting
results, et cetera.

01:02:52.477 --> 01:02:54.060
But when we don't
get results anywhere

01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:55.390
because we're
overwhelmed and all that,

01:02:55.390 --> 01:02:56.973
we start feeling
really bad and crappy

01:02:56.973 --> 01:02:59.310
and we really do feel like
we're not enough, et cetera.

01:02:59.310 --> 01:03:00.555
AUDIENCE: So I loved
the visualization,

01:03:00.555 --> 01:03:02.274
but I have a quick
question on that.

01:03:02.274 --> 01:03:03.940
Is there ever a time
in which the person

01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:07.000
on the right who is
like very positive

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.550
where that's like
counterintuitive

01:03:08.550 --> 01:03:10.430
and that doesn't work
as well as it should?

01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:11.055
ROB SCOTT: Yes.

01:03:11.055 --> 01:03:12.560
AUDIENCE: So like,
oh, I love my job

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:15.650
and just going above and
beyond on these statements that

01:03:15.650 --> 01:03:18.200
may hold you back from finding
something that you really do

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:18.520
love.

01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:19.190
ROB SCOTT: 100%.

01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:21.050
And it's a really good point.

01:03:21.050 --> 01:03:23.790
I think that in that
dramatic example

01:03:23.790 --> 01:03:26.980
it would be good to err on
the side of positive there.

01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:28.720
And that was really
just to illustrate

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:32.734
the power of showing up
kind of confident, happy,

01:03:32.734 --> 01:03:33.650
in love with yourself.

01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:35.430
Not egoically in
love with yourself,

01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:37.910
but just healthily
respectful of who you are

01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:39.790
and what you're
capable of right.

01:03:39.790 --> 01:03:42.540
Where that really is an issue is
when you're getting delusional.

01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:44.927
When you start to say things
like I am a millionaire.

01:03:44.927 --> 01:03:47.260
A lot of things like The
Secret or the Law of Attraction

01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:50.140
might kind of invite us in to.

01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:52.330
It's got to be authentic
and it's got to be real.

01:03:52.330 --> 01:03:53.380
And so when I help
people actually

01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:55.040
craft those to do
the work that I do,

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:56.600
which we didn't go
in too deeply to,

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:59.280
but there's a way to like
re-pattern that for somebody's

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:02.220
subconscious, it really
is important in how

01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:03.920
you pick those.

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:05.840
So in the amount of
time we had, it's

01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:07.450
important to just be positive.

01:04:07.450 --> 01:04:09.280
There's a lot of gain to that.

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:11.841
But then there is a way
to author those correctly

01:04:11.841 --> 01:04:13.840
so that it's really,
really valuable for people.

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:16.755
And so good notice there.

01:04:16.755 --> 01:04:19.130
AUDIENCE: In your opinion--
using the word opinion-- what

01:04:19.130 --> 01:04:21.270
are the global implications
of the current level

01:04:21.270 --> 01:04:24.386
of collective consciousness?

01:04:24.386 --> 01:04:26.260
Actually I'm currently
a life coach, as well.

01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:26.670
ROB SCOTT: Awesome.

01:04:26.670 --> 01:04:28.130
AUDIENCE: You do what you do.

01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:31.450
What do you think are the macro
level kind of implications

01:04:31.450 --> 01:04:35.145
and affects-- symptoms, so
to speak-- that you have

01:04:35.145 --> 01:04:36.320
noticed as a result of this.

01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:36.540
ROB SCOTT: Yeah.

01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:38.320
I think it's the
number one thing.

01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:39.900
I think it's the
number one thing.

01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:45.030
I think if we don't master
our own delusion-- and we can.

01:04:45.030 --> 01:04:46.330
It's not just a hope or a wish.

01:04:46.330 --> 01:04:48.129
It's the profound
difference in my life

01:04:48.129 --> 01:04:49.670
and the profound
difference that I've

01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:52.870
been able to create in
clients-- or facilitate,

01:04:52.870 --> 01:04:56.070
I should say-- profound change.

01:04:56.070 --> 01:04:59.590
Very, very different levels of
consciousness in these people.

01:04:59.590 --> 01:05:02.874
Without that we're kind of
playing whack-a-mole outside.

01:05:02.874 --> 01:05:04.290
It's like, let's
get this problem,

01:05:04.290 --> 01:05:06.623
let's get this problem, but
we're creating more problems

01:05:06.623 --> 01:05:07.900
and we don't kind of see it.

01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:10.820
The story that I
often tell is I was

01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:13.730
really interested in hearing
what Bill Gates decided

01:05:13.730 --> 01:05:16.600
to point his philanthropy at.

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:19.590
Just tons of access, tons
of money, tons of ability,

01:05:19.590 --> 01:05:22.660
access to the best
people, et cetera.

01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:25.895
And he came up at one
point anyway with malaria

01:05:25.895 --> 01:05:26.800
and mosquitoes.

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:29.050
It was like, this is the
problem we're going to solve.

01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:31.630
And there is something that's
very awesome about that.

01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:32.500
It's solvable.

01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:33.310
It's a real thing.

01:05:33.310 --> 01:05:36.242
He's going to attack it in a
way that other people haven't.

01:05:36.242 --> 01:05:38.450
And I think he's probably
made great strides in that.

01:05:38.450 --> 01:05:42.040
But when I hear that, I go
that's the thing that we're

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:42.760
working on?

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:43.530
That's the thing?

01:05:43.530 --> 01:05:46.660
Because why isn't it sex
trafficking, or peak oil,

01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:48.280
or sustainability?

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:51.080
Or the eight million other
things that are going on?

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:53.440
It's because it's not out there.

01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:56.220
It's not out here.

01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:58.180
Problems aren't really problems.

01:05:58.180 --> 01:05:59.460
Problems are opportunities.

01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:02.150
When you start to master
kind of how you think,

01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:04.650
the whole perception of the
world really, really deeply

01:06:04.650 --> 01:06:07.150
changes because we're not
separate from this world

01:06:07.150 --> 01:06:08.780
perceiving this static thing.

01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:11.995
We're creating it in
our experience of it.

01:06:11.995 --> 01:06:15.140
So as we move to having more
healthy, really grounded

01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:15.640
self love.

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:19.086
As we move to having
solutions based

01:06:19.086 --> 01:06:20.460
thinking as a way
of being simply

01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:21.501
because it's more useful.

01:06:21.501 --> 01:06:23.010
Not because we're
delusional or we

01:06:23.010 --> 01:06:25.630
want to be weirdos or
hippies or whatever,

01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:27.890
but it's just that this
is a more useful way

01:06:27.890 --> 01:06:30.140
to think about the world and
think about our problems,

01:06:30.140 --> 01:06:32.470
we can elevate all
of those problems.

01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:33.680
They start to go away.

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:36.159
And when you see more
conscious leaders,

01:06:36.159 --> 01:06:38.700
whether that's political leaders
but I think there's probably

01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:40.330
more examples of
corporate leaders,

01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:42.940
you get really different
kinds of leadership.

01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:44.190
You get contribution back.

01:06:44.190 --> 01:06:46.797
You get this natural way
towards sustainability

01:06:46.797 --> 01:06:48.880
and these problems will
start to solve themselves.

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:50.050
So thank you.

01:06:50.050 --> 01:06:53.930
It's almost like you
seeded that question.

01:06:53.930 --> 01:06:56.009
This is, I think, the
most important thing

01:06:56.009 --> 01:06:56.800
in the whole world.

01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:59.390
Because we are literally walking
around delusional and we're

01:06:59.390 --> 01:07:03.110
blowing people up
for belief systems.

01:07:03.110 --> 01:07:05.610
Our nations and our ideas only.

01:07:05.610 --> 01:07:08.320
And we hold to them so strongly.

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:11.772
We actually grow 18 and 19
and 20-year-olds to go murder

01:07:11.772 --> 01:07:13.230
other people and
be killed themself

01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:16.080
over economies that
are made up and fake.

01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:20.050
So we're stuck in ideas
that we're treating as true

01:07:20.050 --> 01:07:21.320
and they're not true at all.

01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:23.650
And we really need to
evolve how we think.

01:07:23.650 --> 01:07:27.700
We need to really evolve how
we approach these issues.

01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:29.294
And so if we don't
have this ability,

01:07:29.294 --> 01:07:30.710
we're going to
remain in delusion.

01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:33.310
It's going to be very
difficult to profoundly change

01:07:33.310 --> 01:07:34.438
any of those things

01:07:34.438 --> 01:07:37.063
AUDIENCE: Can you talk a little
bit about your choice of tattoo

01:07:37.063 --> 01:07:37.750
on your hand?

01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:39.281
ROB SCOTT: This one?

01:07:39.281 --> 01:07:39.780
Yeah.

01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:43.600
So that is the word "now" placed
right where a watch would go.

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:49.249
And it really is to signify that
time is a construct of thought.

01:07:49.249 --> 01:07:51.540
We've never really been to
the future or into the past.

01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:52.610
We're always here.

01:07:52.610 --> 01:07:56.260
And there is this very
useful kind of play of time.

01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:58.600
And so there's certainly
a reality to it.

01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:00.040
But we're never not here.

01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:02.120
And so this is an
invitation to be present

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:04.990
because if you think
about the future,

01:08:04.990 --> 01:08:06.852
it's really anxiety and fear.

01:08:06.852 --> 01:08:08.310
If you're thinking
about the future

01:08:08.310 --> 01:08:09.640
it's like planning and
how am I going to win

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:10.520
and what's going on.

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:12.470
And the past is guilt and shame.

01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:14.250
The past is like,
what did I do wrong?

01:08:14.250 --> 01:08:15.458
What was going on back there?

01:08:15.458 --> 01:08:17.430
And so that's what a lot
of people in our fear

01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:19.720
based world we're
kind of living.

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:21.920
So the wake up to
this-- and this

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:23.800
is probably close
to 25 years old

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:27.460
now-- is just the truth
that it's always now.

01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:29.520
We should really be
embodied and present

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:33.210
and in this moment fully instead
of overly anxious or worried

01:08:33.210 --> 01:08:35.220
or carrying too much
other story, because it's

01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:36.720
just beautiful right here.

01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:39.826
There was a moment where I
really woke up to the fact--

01:08:39.826 --> 01:08:41.950
like I could have been
really mad about my abusers.

01:08:41.950 --> 01:08:44.381
I could still just be
so pissed about that.

01:08:44.381 --> 01:08:44.880
Oh my god.

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:45.170
Oh my god.

01:08:45.170 --> 01:08:45.669
Oh my god.

01:08:45.669 --> 01:08:47.930
And if I do that, if I'm
experiencing about that

01:08:47.930 --> 01:08:50.263
and ranting about it and I'm
pissed and this is horrible

01:08:50.263 --> 01:08:52.569
and all that stuff,
what's going on?

01:08:52.569 --> 01:08:54.189
They're not here.

01:08:54.189 --> 01:08:55.080
They're not here.

01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:56.330
Nothing's happening to me now.

01:08:56.330 --> 01:08:58.704
Nobody's punching me or hurting
me or doing anything now.

01:08:58.704 --> 01:09:00.479
So who's bringing it here?

01:09:00.479 --> 01:09:01.840
I'm bringing it here.

01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:05.300
I'm carrying this
crap from my past

01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:07.660
and literally in the form
of experiencing it now

01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:09.550
I'm kind of planning
it into my future just

01:09:09.550 --> 01:09:12.394
to keep living through it
again and again and again.

01:09:12.394 --> 01:09:13.810
And if I don't
wake up to the fact

01:09:13.810 --> 01:09:16.370
that I'm doing that, that that's
the meaning that I'm making,

01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:19.540
then I'm just stuck in that.

01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:22.729
This is a very high
level group of people.

01:09:22.729 --> 01:09:24.970
I have lived in
places where there's

01:09:24.970 --> 01:09:28.450
a lot more dysfunction than you
might find on a Google campus.

01:09:28.450 --> 01:09:32.000
And you see people 50-years-old
that are literally delusionally

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.279
angry about something that
happened when they were 16

01:09:34.279 --> 01:09:36.859
and they're still mumbling
about it, carrying it around.

01:09:36.859 --> 01:09:40.649
And the core is all in the
anger and the Pabst Blue Ribbon

01:09:40.649 --> 01:09:42.810
to make that feel better.

01:09:42.810 --> 01:09:44.470
That's not a very
expressed life.

01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:45.660
That's not a powerful life.

01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:46.550
It's not a big life.

01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:49.670
And we're capable of more
if we can wake up and start

01:09:49.670 --> 01:09:50.479
to manage this.

01:09:50.479 --> 01:09:53.094
Start to manage our thinking.

01:09:53.094 --> 01:09:53.760
ADAM: All right.

01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:54.940
Well, thank you,
everybody for coming.

01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:56.790
And thank you, Rob, for
sharing these ideas with us.

01:09:56.790 --> 01:09:57.690
ROB SCOTT: Deeply
appreciate your time.

01:09:57.690 --> 01:09:58.890
Thank you guys so much.

01:09:58.890 --> 01:09:59.490
Thank you.

01:09:59.490 --> 01:10:00.731
Awesome.
