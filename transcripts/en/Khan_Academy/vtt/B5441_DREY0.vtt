00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:03.232
- [Instructor] So I have
two curves graphed here.

00:00:03.232 --> 00:00:06.405
And we're used to seeing things
where y is a function of x,

00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:09.889
but here we have x as a function of y.

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:12.554
In fact, we can write this top expression

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:15.460
as being a function of y.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.890
And this second one, just
to make it different,

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.529
we could view this as g of y.

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.352
Once again, it is a function of y.

00:00:23.352 --> 00:00:27.035
And what we're concerning
ourselves with in this video is

00:00:27.035 --> 00:00:28.523
how do we find this area

00:00:28.523 --> 00:00:32.938
in this light blue color
between these two curves?

00:00:32.938 --> 00:00:35.023
And I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:35.023 --> 00:00:37.674
and try to work through it.

00:00:37.674 --> 00:00:39.758
All right, so a huge hint here is

00:00:39.758 --> 00:00:43.044
we're going to want to
integrate with respect to y,

00:00:43.044 --> 00:00:46.427
a definite integral where
our bounds are in terms of y.

00:00:46.427 --> 00:00:47.933
So for example, this is,

00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:50.636
this lower point of
intersection right over here,

00:00:50.636 --> 00:00:53.615
this would be our lower
bound in terms of y.

00:00:53.615 --> 00:00:55.380
Let's call that y one.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.043
And then,

00:00:57.043 --> 00:01:00.771
this up here, this would
be our upper y bound.

00:01:00.771 --> 00:01:04.183
So if we think about where do
these two curves intersect,

00:01:04.183 --> 00:01:07.378
and we look at the y-coordinates
of those intersections,

00:01:07.378 --> 00:01:10.671
well, that gives us two nice
bounds for our integral.

00:01:10.671 --> 00:01:15.367
So we're gonna take our
integral from y one to y two,

00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:16.200
from y one

00:01:17.697 --> 00:01:18.530
to y two,

00:01:20.692 --> 00:01:21.685
y two.

00:01:21.685 --> 00:01:26.167
We're going to integrate
with respect to y, dy.

00:01:26.167 --> 00:01:29.054
And so what are we going to sum up?

00:01:29.054 --> 00:01:32.261
Well, when we integrate,
we can think about

00:01:32.261 --> 00:01:35.639
taking the sum of
infinitely thin rectangles.

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:37.869
And in this case, it would
infinitely flat rectangles

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.279
since we're thinking about dy.

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:43.963
So dy would be the height
of each of these rectangles.

00:01:43.963 --> 00:01:46.770
And what would be, in this case, the width

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.705
or the length of this
rectangle right over here?

00:01:49.705 --> 00:01:53.042
Well, over this interval,
from y one to y two,

00:01:53.042 --> 00:01:55.753
our blue function, f of y,

00:01:55.753 --> 00:01:59.108
takes on larger x-values than g of y.

00:01:59.108 --> 00:02:03.275
So this length right over
here, this would be f of y,

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.546
f of y,

00:02:05.546 --> 00:02:08.687
this x-value minus this x-value,

00:02:08.687 --> 00:02:09.770
minus g of y.

00:02:11.447 --> 00:02:13.864
So this is going to be f of y

00:02:15.295 --> 00:02:16.378
minus g of y,

00:02:17.716 --> 00:02:19.338
g of y.

00:02:19.338 --> 00:02:21.926
Well, we know what f of y and g of y are.

00:02:21.926 --> 00:02:23.044
Really, the trickiest part is,

00:02:23.044 --> 00:02:25.198
is figuring out these
points of intersection.

00:02:25.198 --> 00:02:27.653
So let's think about where
these two curves intersect.

00:02:27.653 --> 00:02:29.018
They are both equal to x,

00:02:29.018 --> 00:02:32.231
so we can set these two y
expressions equal to each other.

00:02:32.231 --> 00:02:34.995
So we know that negative,

00:02:34.995 --> 00:02:36.540
let me do it in that other color,

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.054
so we know that negative
y squared plus three y

00:02:41.054 --> 00:02:44.388
plus 11 is going to be equal to this,

00:02:44.388 --> 00:02:47.684
is going to be equal to y squared

00:02:47.684 --> 00:02:48.517
plus y

00:02:50.158 --> 00:02:50.991
minus one.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.183
So let's just subtract all
of this from both sides

00:02:54.183 --> 00:02:55.903
so that on the right side we have a zero

00:02:55.903 --> 00:02:58.298
and on the left side we
just have a quadratic.

00:02:58.298 --> 00:03:00.452
So let's subtract y squared.

00:03:00.452 --> 00:03:01.854
Let's subtract y.

00:03:01.854 --> 00:03:06.189
And then subtract negative
one, which is just adding one.

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:08.485
And over here, we're going
to do the same thing,

00:03:08.485 --> 00:03:10.151
minus y plus one.

00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:13.100
And what we are left
with is going to be a,

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.153
hopefully, a straightforward quadratic.

00:03:15.153 --> 00:03:19.524
So let's see, this is going
to be negative two y squared

00:03:19.524 --> 00:03:20.441
plus two y.

00:03:21.795 --> 00:03:22.628
Am I doing that right?

00:03:22.628 --> 00:03:24.628
Yep, plus two y, plus 12

00:03:26.328 --> 00:03:27.745
is equal to zero.

00:03:29.095 --> 00:03:32.785
And then this over here I can
factor out a negative two,

00:03:32.785 --> 00:03:36.838
and I get negative two
times y squared minus y

00:03:36.838 --> 00:03:39.049
minus six is equal to zero.

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.084
This we can factor from inspection.

00:03:41.084 --> 00:03:43.245
What two numbers, when we
add, equal negative one?

00:03:43.245 --> 00:03:45.603
When we take their product,
we get negative six?

00:03:45.603 --> 00:03:48.133
Well, that would be
negative three and two.

00:03:48.133 --> 00:03:52.896
So this is going to be negative
two times y minus three

00:03:52.896 --> 00:03:54.313
times y plus two.

00:03:55.811 --> 00:03:58.298
That's just straightforward
factoring a polynomial,

00:03:58.298 --> 00:03:59.233
a quadratic.

00:03:59.233 --> 00:04:00.078
Did I do that right?

00:04:00.078 --> 00:04:02.491
Yep, that looks right, is equal to zero.

00:04:02.491 --> 00:04:04.368
So what are the points of intersection?

00:04:04.368 --> 00:04:07.156
The points of intersection are going to be

00:04:07.156 --> 00:04:11.323
y is equal to three and y
is equal to negative two.

00:04:13.306 --> 00:04:16.642
So this right over here is
y is equal to negative two,

00:04:16.642 --> 00:04:20.642
and then the upper bound
is y is equal to three.

00:04:21.903 --> 00:04:26.248
So now we just have to evaluate
this from negative two,

00:04:26.248 --> 00:04:28.973
all the way until three.

00:04:28.973 --> 00:04:29.806
So let's do that.

00:04:29.806 --> 00:04:30.804
I'm gonna clear this out,

00:04:30.804 --> 00:04:33.612
so I get a little bit of real estate.

00:04:33.612 --> 00:04:37.274
So this is equal to the integral from

00:04:37.274 --> 00:04:38.712
negative two

00:04:38.712 --> 00:04:39.629
to three of

00:04:42.585 --> 00:04:44.168
negative y squared,

00:04:45.384 --> 00:04:47.098
plus three y,

00:04:47.098 --> 00:04:47.931
plus 11,

00:04:49.067 --> 00:04:51.027
minus all of this stuff.

00:04:51.027 --> 00:04:52.804
So if we just distribute
a negative sign here,

00:04:52.804 --> 00:04:54.985
it's minus y squared,

00:04:54.985 --> 00:04:56.485
minus y, plus one,

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.213
and then we have a dy,

00:05:00.123 --> 00:05:01.589
dy.

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:04.973
This is equal to the
definite integral from

00:05:04.973 --> 00:05:07.806
negative two to positive three of,

00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:13.359
let's see, negative y
squared minus y squared,

00:05:13.359 --> 00:05:15.515
negative two y squared,

00:05:15.515 --> 00:05:20.178
and then three y minus y
is going to be plus two y.

00:05:20.178 --> 00:05:24.395
And then 11 plus one, plus
12, we saw this just now,

00:05:24.395 --> 00:05:27.572
when we were trying to solve for y, dy.

00:05:27.572 --> 00:05:29.890
And so what is that going to be equal to?

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.115
Well, we just take the
antiderivative here.

00:05:32.115 --> 00:05:35.130
This is going to be,
let's see, negative two.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.226
Let's increment the
exponent, y to the third.

00:05:37.226 --> 00:05:39.579
Divide by that exponent,
reverse power rule,

00:05:39.579 --> 00:05:43.746
plus two y squared divided by
two, which is just y squared,

00:05:44.658 --> 00:05:46.464
just the reverse power rule,

00:05:46.464 --> 00:05:48.047
and then plus 12 y.

00:05:49.876 --> 00:05:53.293
And we're going to evaluate that at three

00:05:54.662 --> 00:05:57.003
and at negative two.

00:05:57.003 --> 00:06:00.862
So if we evaluate that at
three, we are going to get,

00:06:00.862 --> 00:06:03.192
let's see, negative two

00:06:03.192 --> 00:06:04.025
times 27

00:06:05.137 --> 00:06:06.462
over three,

00:06:06.462 --> 00:06:08.072
plus nine,

00:06:08.072 --> 00:06:08.905
plus 36.

00:06:09.813 --> 00:06:14.488
And then we are going to
want to subtract, minus

00:06:14.488 --> 00:06:16.158
all of this evaluated at negative two.

00:06:16.158 --> 00:06:20.325
So it's going to be negative
two times negative eight

00:06:21.654 --> 00:06:22.571
over three,

00:06:24.343 --> 00:06:25.176
plus four,

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:28.063
minus 24.

00:06:28.063 --> 00:06:30.552
So we just have a little bit
of mathematics ahead of us.

00:06:30.552 --> 00:06:31.443
So let's see,

00:06:31.443 --> 00:06:34.848
this is going to be 27
divided by three is nine.

00:06:34.848 --> 00:06:36.765
So this is negative 18.

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:38.766
Negative 18

00:06:39.717 --> 00:06:43.329
plus nine is going to be negative nine,

00:06:43.329 --> 00:06:46.999
plus 36, all of that is
going to be equal to,

00:06:46.999 --> 00:06:49.999
so the stuff in blue is equal to 27.

00:06:50.916 --> 00:06:51.896
Right, did I do that right?

00:06:51.896 --> 00:06:55.641
Get negative 18 plus nine, yep, 27.

00:06:55.641 --> 00:06:59.005
And then all the stuff in red over here,

00:06:59.005 --> 00:07:02.098
we have, this is going to be
negative times a negative,

00:07:02.098 --> 00:07:06.115
so it's 16 over three,
plus four, minus 24.

00:07:06.115 --> 00:07:08.198
So that is going to be 16

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:10.797
over three,

00:07:11.766 --> 00:07:13.016
and then minus,

00:07:14.126 --> 00:07:14.959
minus 20,

00:07:16.487 --> 00:07:18.001
minus 20.

00:07:18.001 --> 00:07:20.446
But then we have this
negative out here, so it's,

00:07:20.446 --> 00:07:22.879
if we distribute that, we'll get plus 20,

00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:25.900
minus, we could say
instead of 16 over three,

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.218
we could rewrite that as 5 1/3,

00:07:28.218 --> 00:07:30.423
minus 5 1/3.

00:07:30.423 --> 00:07:31.964
And so what is that going to get us?

00:07:31.964 --> 00:07:34.558
Let me scroll down a little
bit, or let me go to the right,

00:07:34.558 --> 00:07:37.580
so I have a little bit
more real estate here.

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.838
So then that is going to be equal to,

00:07:40.838 --> 00:07:43.338
get a minor drum roll here, 47

00:07:44.259 --> 00:07:45.092
minus five

00:07:45.964 --> 00:07:47.694
minus 1/3,

00:07:47.694 --> 00:07:51.609
which is equal to, let's see,
47 minus five, that's 42,

00:07:51.609 --> 00:07:55.478
minus 1/3 is, now we get a drum roll,

00:07:55.478 --> 00:07:56.978
41 2/3.

00:08:00.513 --> 00:08:01.846
And we are done.
