00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:12.830
Using a Charge Card to Buy $170 Million Painting

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.820
Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s
there was a legend that was passed around

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.240
speaking of a special credit card only issued
by American Express to people with more zeroes

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.130
in their bank balance than a half eaten bowl
of Cheerios.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.820
This was, of course, not true, or at least
it wasn’t until 1999 when American Express

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.970
decided to make the card a reality.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.830
To quote a director for the company, Doug
Smith, “There had been rumors going around

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.290
that we had this ultra-exclusive black card
for elite customers.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.900
It wasn’t true, but we decided to capitalize
on the idea anyway.”

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.600
Dubbed “The Centurion Card”, this card
is functionally identical to an American Express

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.190
platinum card with a few added benefits exclusive
to Amex’s most affluent customers.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.630
We won’t bore you with some of the more
mundane benefits of being rich enough to have

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.270
a platinum card, like hotel upgrades and having
most transaction fees waived, because there’s

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.290
a much more interesting benefit to talk about-
the 24 hour concierge service.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.000
Yes, the platinum customers have unlimited,
round the clock access to a number they can

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.530
call for help doing just about anything.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.970
While on paper the service is supposed to
be used for things like booking hotels or

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.640
finding restaurants in a city one is not familiar
with, if the individual is a little more,

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.870
shall we say, creative, the service is essentially
a 24 hour personal assistant.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.280
For example, consider the story of internet
prankster John Hargrave, who once tried to

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.730
push the limits of a similar service offered
by his Visa Signature Chase card.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.460
Hargrave found that his concierge service
were happy to help him do everything from

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.430
book a trip to space to help him with a crossword
puzzle he was stuck on.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.670
However, after asking a representative if
there was something they wouldn’t do, he

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.950
discovered it was against Chase’s policy
to use the service to run personal errands,

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.920
plan a wedding or help arrange a visit to
a child prostitute…

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.670
The company did, however, admit that they’d
be more than happy to help “make an appointment

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.450
for a rendezvous at the Bunny Ranch” (a
legal brothel in Nevada), if a customer so

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:05.450
desired it.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.660
Now, keep in mind, this is the level of service
offered by a regular credit card a person

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.260
with an average income could afford- so imagine
what kind of things a billionaire with an

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.200
uber-exclusive card only granted to the upper
echelons of society can get if they asked.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.030
If you’re imagination isn’t all that great,
according to one executive at Amex asked about

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.190
the most outlandish requests the company has
fulfilled, he noted they were once asked to

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.220
deliver a handful of sand from the Dead Sea
to London.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.090
The company did this by sending an international
courier to the shores of the Dead Sea on a

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.090
motorcycle.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.560
The courier then posted the sand to the customer.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.270
Apparently the sand was to be used in a school
project.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.670
In another case, the cardholder wanted to
appear on a soap opera, but wasn’t sure

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.200
how to make this happen.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.550
The Amex representative managed to get the
woman an audition for a role in such a show.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.180
Yet another bizarre request was from someone
wanting Amex to find the horse ridden by Kevin

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.450
Costner in Dances with Wolves.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.790
They were not only able to track this down
for the customer (with the horse then residing

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.641
in Mexico), but were also able to arrange
for purchase of the animal and then had it

00:03:01.641 --> 00:03:04.120
transported to Europe where the customer lived.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.040
In addition to a more tailored, dedicated
concierge service, the Centurion Card comes

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.830
with a personal travel agent, automatic access
to a number of high-end clubs for rich people,

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.330
and personal shoppers for the most exclusive
stores in the world.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.490
The card also grants extensive travel related
benefits such as free travel insurance, access

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:26.860
to exclusive airport lounges and first class
upgrades on flights with certain airlines.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.000
This might all have you wondering how exactly
you get your hands on such a card and what

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.920
the specific requirements are.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.459
Well, nobody outside the company knows exactly.

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:42.239
You see, it’s invitation only and American
Express has never released any official information

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.230
about what criteria they use to decide who
is eligible.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.750
This said, the rumour mill has it that if
you really want an invitation for a Centurion

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.450
Card there are three basic criteria you need
to fill:

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.550
You need to already be an American Express
platinum card holder.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.730
You need to have used that card for at least
a year.

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:09.720
You need to spend on average between $250,000
and $500,000 each year on your card.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.900
As for any overall wealth requirement, there’s
currently no consensus on how wealthy you

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.430
need to be to be eligible for the card, though
a commonly quoted annual income is about $1.3

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.430
million minimum.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.830
This said, there are reportedly Centurion
Card holders “who merely make mid-six-figure

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.520
salaries”, so perhaps they use a flexible
or weighted requirements system (presumably

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.330
including net worth and credit score), rather
than a more rigid one mostly based on income

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.819
and spending habits.

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:40.870
What is more definitively known is that, once
offered the card, you usually have to pay

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.339
a joining fee, plus a rather hefty annual
fee.

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:49.341
While it varies from country to country, for
reference, in the United States it’s a $7,500

00:04:49.341 --> 00:04:55.089
joining fee with a further annual charge of
$2,500 for each card holder.

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:59.750
While this is amazingly expensive, if one
travels a lot, the perks of the card, including

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.969
that virtual personal assistant, can very
easily make it worth it.

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:07.759
So what can the lucky few who do own a Centurion
Card buy with it?

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:11.129
Well, to put it simply, anything they want.

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:14.619
According to American Express executives,
the card’s limit is effectively infinite

00:05:14.619 --> 00:05:17.710
and only bound by the holder’s individual
wealth.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.009
To this end, the card’s actual limit is
decided by a comprehensive analysis of the

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:23.939
holder’s spending habits and net worth.

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:29.229
As for the most extravagant thing ever purchased
using one, that is probably the Amedeo Modigliani

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:35.009
painting Reclining Nude which was purchased
by Chinese billionaire, Liu Yiqian, in 2015.

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:36.319
The total cost?

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:37.970
$170 million…

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.529
And, yes, he put it on his card.

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:45.050
This was actually the second time he’d used
his card for such an expensive object around

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:50.259
this time, previously paying $36 million for
a tea cup that dated back to the Ming Dynasty.

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:55.659
As if being able to pay for a $170 million
painting (among many other large purchases)

00:05:55.659 --> 00:06:00.280
with a an Amex wasn’t ridiculous enough,
Yiqian has also earned perhaps the most charge

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.419
card reward points of anyone in history, with
his wife noting they had enough points to

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:07.869
fly the family in luxury for free for the
rest of their lives.

00:06:07.869 --> 00:06:12.819
However, apparently one can also use the points
to buy luxury items, such as a 26-carat diamond

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:16.919
bracelet that goes for a mere 33 million rewards
points…

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:20.449
Of course, the points weren’t the only reason
he put the painting and other such expensive

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:22.930
items on his charge card, instead of paying
cash.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.599
You see, China has restrictions on how much
money an individual can transfer out of country

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:30.939
per year at around the equivalent of $50,000.

00:06:30.939 --> 00:06:35.120
Needless to say, for a billionaire with expensive
tastes, this is extremely restricting when

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.500
wanting to buy something out of country.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.169
By using the card, it circumvents this restriction
completely as his card was issued through

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:42.520
the bank of China.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:07:36.120
So he’s paying them back, not sending money
out of country himself.
