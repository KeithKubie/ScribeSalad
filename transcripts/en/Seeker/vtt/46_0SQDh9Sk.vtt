00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.420
Throw away that antibacterial soap, no use
fighting it anymore.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:15.780
Scientists have found bacteria are perfectly
happy living 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.440
in the clouds!

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.080
Clouds are pretty, and it’s fun to imagine
what the shapes are.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.210
That one's a dinosaur holding a picnic basket!

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.949
That one's a box with… a lid.

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.720
And they're both filled to the brim with bacteria!

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.259
Bacteria are literally everywhere, on every
surface of everything all the time.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.780
I mean, it's pretty obvious that bacteria
can live in the air down here, but they're

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.359
tiny after all and thus can be easily picked
up by the wind.

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:43.909
Full disclosure, I never even thought about
this, but bacteria have been found almost

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:47.899
25 miles up and all OVER in the clouds!

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.140
Scientists have found bacteria living above
rainforests and deserts, mountains and seas,

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.530
even inside hail and snow!

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.839
Before you freak out, that's not actually
a bad thing; they might help in cloud formation,

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:03.660
and can even live in lightning-prone storm
clouds to encourage rain or hail.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.210
Researchers have found as many organisms in
parts of the sky as in an average river.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.380
Clouds look pure and pretty, but on the microlevel
they're teeming with bacteria, algae, fungi

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.390
and other tiny plants and animals.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.479
Microorganisms may see clouds as a giant transportation
system, growing and multiplying so the colony

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.810
can populate a new area, quote "piggybacking
on the hydrological cycle," said one scientist.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.649
But, a new study in Environmental Science
and Technology has found bacteria are quite

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:32.170
happy to live in the upper atmosphere.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.729
They're not just looking to populate new areas
alone!

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.299
They're okay with this crazy fly-by-the-seat-of-their-pants
life!

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.270
This study was specifically done on a species
of bacillus bacteria, in the Auvergne region

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.270
of France.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.979
Bacteria have been collected from the sky
since the 1920s, so they probably flew up

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.079
and collected samples and brought them back
to Earth for testing.

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:57.429
But, somewhat unexpectedly, the researchers
found these cloud-borne microorganisms weren't

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:02.420
dormant and floating aimlessly, but were actively
consuming saccharides, or sugars, which are

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.140
also found in that white puffy stuff!

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.610
The sugars are blown there by the wind too;
originating from plants and microorganisms

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:11.610
on the ground.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.390
The bacteria use those sugars to sustain themselves,
but more importantly as building blocks to

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.800
create polysaccharide armor which serves to
protect the little guys.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.007
More research is needed, but it appears the
microbes have evolved to fight the stronger

00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:24.620
UV rays which reach the clouds at high altitude;
not to mention the sub zero temperatures.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.010
From there, they multiply, help form clouds,
and then rain, hail or snow back to Earth

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.569
again.

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.120
Amazing!

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.640
There's even bacteria on the Space Station
guys.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.640
It's inescapable.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.730
Are you freaking out?

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:40.730
Bacteria everywhere!!!

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:48.049
Or are you shrugging and living with the reality?
