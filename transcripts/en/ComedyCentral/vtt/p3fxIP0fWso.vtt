It's time to play
First Draft Movie Quotes.

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.005
First Draft Movie Quotes.

00:00:10.344 --> 00:00:12.179
Movies are great
not only 'cause they feature

00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:15.115
often Tom Hardy doing a weird
accent with his shirt off--

00:00:15.148 --> 00:00:18.952
meow-- uh, but also because they
give us very memorable quotes,

00:00:18.986 --> 00:00:20.621
from "Life is like a box
of chocolates,"

00:00:20.654 --> 00:00:22.289
pretty much anything
from <i>Lebowski.</i>

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:24.758
But all good writing takes work,
and I'm sure some

00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:27.227
of those timeless words sucked
before they were great.

00:00:27.261 --> 00:00:29.897
So I'd like you to give me
as many first draft movie quotes

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.499
as you possibly can.
Examples might be like, uh,

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:34.334
"Life is like a box of (bleep)"

00:00:34.368 --> 00:00:38.472
or "Come with me if you want
to continue breathing

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:42.009
and taking oxygen and converting
it into carbon dioxide."

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:44.011
Uh... It was very bad.

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:46.980
The first draft of that
was very bad.

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:50.017
And begin. Jonathan.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.686
I'll have what Meg Ryan's
having, an orgasm.

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.688
Nice. Points. Dave Hill.

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:56.890
My name is James Bond.
What's your name?

00:00:56.924 --> 00:00:58.492
Points.

00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:00.360
Jonathan Coulton.

00:01:00.394 --> 00:01:03.564
I'm not literally Spartacus, but
I support what he stands for.

00:01:03.597 --> 00:01:06.166
All right, points. Dave Hill.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.235
I really hope these fences
hold up.

00:01:08.268 --> 00:01:10.170
After all, it is Jurassic Park.

00:01:10.204 --> 00:01:12.506
Yeah, points. Aimee Mann.

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:14.308
This boat is too small
for this big shark.

00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:16.977
Yes, points. Points. Dave Hill.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.479
"Murder" backwards.
"Murder" backwards.

00:01:19.513 --> 00:01:21.849
"Murder" backwards.

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.891
Uh, Aimee.

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:33.060
It's against regulations
to have snakes on this plane.

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:34.795
Yes, points.

00:01:34.828 --> 00:01:36.530
Uh, Jonathan Coulton.

00:01:36.563 --> 00:01:39.499
I see dead people.
For instance, you, you're dead.

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:42.269
Points.
