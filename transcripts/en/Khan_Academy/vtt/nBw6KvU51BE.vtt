00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.150
Let's think about the
market for plastic bags.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.900
And I'm picking this
market in particular

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.430
because there might be
some cost associated

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.060
with plastic bags that aren't
captured when you're only

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.980
looking at it from
the point of view

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.910
of the suppliers
or the consumers.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.980
So right over here, you
have a demand curve.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.630
And that's really the demand
coming from the supermarkets.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:24.970
So this is the demand curve.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.510
You could also view it
as marginal benefit.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.450
So that very first bag
that gets produced,

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.570
a supermarket gets a
lot of marginal benefit.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.029
They'd really want
to get that bag,

00:00:34.029 --> 00:00:36.070
because then they could
give it to the people who

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.980
shop at the supermarket, and
they can carry their bags home.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.830
But then each incremental
bag after that,

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.230
the marginal benefit gets
lower and lower and lower.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.940
And this green curve
over here-- we've

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.980
seen this multiple times--
that is our supply curve, which

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.370
we can also think of it as
our marginal cost curve.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.260
To produce the very first
bag, the opportunity cost

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.930
for that very
first bag is about,

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.730
looks like about
a penny per bag.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.605
And then it gets higher
and higher and higher

00:00:59.605 --> 00:01:01.240
as you produce
more and more bags.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.101
And we have an equilibrium price
and an equilibrium quantity.

00:01:04.101 --> 00:01:06.100
Our equilibrium quantity
looks like it's about 3

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.700
and 1/2 million bags.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.000
We have an equilibrium price
of about $0.02 per bag.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.380
And if this were all of the
cost and all of the benefits,

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.520
then this area right over
here would show the total,

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.000
the aggregate total benefit
that the ecosystem here,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.550
that the suppliers
and the consumers,

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.790
or the supermarkets or the
consumers in this case,

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.980
are getting from
this transaction.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.899
Marginal benefit higher
than marginal cost;

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:35.690
marginal benefit higher
than marginal cost.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.160
This whole area is
our total surplus,

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.380
and we've seen that
multiple times.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.970
But now let's think
about that added cost

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.070
that plastic bags have that
are not factored in to the cost

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.110
and the prices, or the cost and
the benefits right over here.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.410
Plastic bags have a
negative externality.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.880
There's a cost associated.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.530
So it's negative because
there's a cost associated

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.130
with plastic bags that is
not being borne by either

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.310
in this situation, that
is not being factored

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.112
into the marginal cost curve.

00:02:10.112 --> 00:02:11.820
You can also have
positive externalities,

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:12.550
which are a benefit.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.550
Maybe you're talking about
the market for trees,

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.010
and society benefits when
more plants or more trees

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.687
are being planted, or whatever.

00:02:18.687 --> 00:02:19.520
And let's just say--

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.150
And that negative
externality, that's

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.590
coming from obvious things.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.470
You know, these bags
are going to be litter.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.428
They're going to be on
the side of the highway.

00:02:26.428 --> 00:02:28.040
The city has to clean them up.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.170
There's environmental
risks due to them.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.230
Animals might eat them
and choke on them,

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.490
and turtles might drown,
and whatever else,

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.990
because they're choking on
plastic bags and whatever else.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.580
And so they hire some experts.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.150
And this is not an
easy thing to do,

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.060
but it's determined that
the negative externality

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.440
of these plastic bags
is $0.02 per bag.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.680
Or another way to think
of it, the cost to society

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.700
and the environment above
and beyond the marginal cost

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.400
to the producers,
is $0.02 per bag.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.700
Now, given that, if we
assume this statement right

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.510
over here-- and it's
not an easy thing

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.750
to come up with this
number-- but if we assume

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.940
that this number
is true, what then

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.970
is the optimal amount
of bags to purchase?

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.074
And what are we
actually doing if we--

00:03:09.074 --> 00:03:10.990
What is the optimum
amount of bags to produce?

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.510
And what are we doing when
we do produce this much?

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.070
And to think about that,
let's create a new curve.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.864
This is the supplier's
marginal cost.

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:19.280
Let's create another
curve that is

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.390
the supplier plus
society's marginal cost.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.960
So that first bag supplier,
his opportunity cost

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.010
is about a penny,
but for society it's

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.350
costing another $0.02.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.170
So supplier plus society
is costing almost $0.03.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.440
And so we can plot
out another curve

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:44.010
which we can view as the
supplier plus society

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.560
marginal cost.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.400
So now we can think of things
in terms of total benefit,

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.720
or total net benefit, I
guess, that's happening.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.130
That very first
bag, the supermarket

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.470
that buys it is still getting
that over $0.05 of benefit.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.260
But now if we think about
the net benefit to society,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.110
it's not this whole height
all the way down to a penny.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.340
It's only this part
right over here.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.870
It's only the difference
between five and three

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.970
is the marginal net benefit, if
you take the marginal benefit

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.140
and you subtract out the total
marginal costs, including

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.649
the externalities.

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:20.510
And so the next bag, the total
cost gets a little higher,

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.670
the marginal benefit
gets a little bit lower.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.230
And you keep, it makes
sense for society--

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.650
It will keep getting
benefit from this,

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.250
if we think of the
entire ecosystem,

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.060
will keep getting benefit until
we hit this other equilibrium

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.680
point over here.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.580
And once we get past
that equilibrium point,

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.080
now when we think
holistically, when

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.010
we think of the environment and
the government and all of that,

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.280
now all of a sudden the marginal
cost of each incremental unit

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.200
is higher than the
marginal benefit.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.060
So if we were to
produce beyond that,

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.300
now we're incurring costs.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.952
Now we're essentially
eating out all

00:04:53.952 --> 00:04:55.660
of the benefit that
we would have gotten.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.420
And if we were to produce all
the way to our old equilibrium

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.620
point over here, we more, in the
way-- I was just eyeballing it,

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.900
the purple area is more
than the yellow area--

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.040
we're now getting a negative
total benefit to society.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.760
Or you could say a
negative total surplus.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.340
And we haven't visualized
it this way in the past.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.930
It's unusual for us
to see a dead weight

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.550
loss on this side of
the equilibrium point,

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.380
but you can also
view it that way.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.445
So this right over here
is negative surplus.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.840
And so what you really
want holistically

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.789
if you are the benevolent
emperor of the society,

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:35.830
and you really want to
factor in all of the costs

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.270
and benefits of the plastic
bags, the ideal thing

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.070
if you want to optimize
the benefit in society,

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.570
you would want the
equilibrium price

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.860
to be around here-- that
looks like about 350--

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.880
and the equilibrium
quantity to be--

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.240
this looks about 1.8 million.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.000
And you would not want all
of this excess quantity that

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.690
is taking away, that is
less efficient for society.
