00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
I was scrolling through my Instagram the other day when I realized

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:08.040
Lots of selfies.  Which reminds me...

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.640
And even though social media is kind of technically my job

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.560
we live in a world that tells us that looking prettier means more

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.720
of everything.  More compliments.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.320
You look like a girl with a lot of cats!

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.160
More tips.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.560
Hi, how can I help you?

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.840
Hey you're pretty.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:25.980
Oh, thank you--

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.440
You're pretty!

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.520
Oh, okay.  Th-thank you.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.800
More opportunities.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.900
Hey.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.520
Ew.  Never.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.340
I'm rich.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.680
Ew.  Go buy me a bunch of drinks.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.240
Attention, affection, visibility, likes, views, subscribers

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.900
and on and on and on.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.920
And there has been scientific proof on attractive privilege.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.820
Just like white or rich privilege, there are benefits to being attractive.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.760
And this kind of brought me to the question:

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.880
Oh my God.  Am I narcissistic?  No!

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.200
I'm not narcissistic.  I mean yeah, I've put a considerable amount of time analyziing

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.600
how I could brand myself as a Leading Lady forcing me to work out, learn how to apply my make up

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.220
get my nails done, enhance my stupid straight eye lashes with eyelash-extensions so I never have to

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.300
curl them again. I mean I did it for my birthday once and now I'm addicted.  Shut up.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.540
And it really started making me think about how social media not only makes it so easy

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.300
to get wrapped up in ourselves, but kind of makes you fine tune your appearance and like

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.720
wanna strive to be better and how you know the right angle for a selfie.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.160
And it was just like ewh!

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.660
Like I don't want to be that.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:38.360
But what about you?  Do you ever think about how the internet has affected our level of self-involvement?

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.160
And if it has made us more narcissistic or not?

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.120
I like to think that I'm not narcissistic but sometimes I wonder if I'm hiding behind the excuse that like

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.580
Oh, I'm an actress.  I have to think about what I look like.  In Hollywood you have to be beautiful

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.000
or you're not going to have a career.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.740
But I don't really know and I'm genuinely afraid sometimes that I'm going to be a narcissist.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.260
But then I'm like:  Oh, as long as I'm aware like, it wont happen, it's fine.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.400
But who knows?

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:09.160
I'm Anna Akana.  Oh and, before I go--my make up just looks real good today so I'm going to just snap one.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.400
Just kidding.  I'm Anna Akana.  Stay awesome Gotham.  Or attractive.
