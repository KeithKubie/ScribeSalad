00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.680
&gt;&gt;Dan Galpin: Nice.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.319
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: All right.

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:06.319
Hi there.

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:07.720
Welcome to the Friday Games Review.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.600
I am your host, Ian Ni-Lewis.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.600
Wait!

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.600
No, we totally switched off, right?

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.600
&gt;&gt;Galpin: We totally switched off.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.600
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: I'm not the host anymore.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.600
&gt;&gt;Galpin: That's okay.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.600
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: God, I'm not the host anymore.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.083
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Actually, according to the titles,
you're Dan Galpin and I'm Ian Ni-Lewis.

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:18.170
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Did I get that wrong?!

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.000
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I know, I know.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Ah.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Wait, [laughs] hold on.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.939
[rustling sounds] I just dropped my mike,
so everyone's going, "Oh no, this rustling

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:27.939
sound!"

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:28.939
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Nice.

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.650
It's okay, dude, don't complain on YouTube!

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.669
We've heard it all before.

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:33.669
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, exactly.

00:00:33.669 --> 00:00:34.669
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: I can't believe I did that.

00:00:34.669 --> 00:00:35.669
You know why?

00:00:35.669 --> 00:00:36.669
'Cause I'm left-right challenged.

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:37.669
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Oooookay, okay.

00:00:37.669 --> 00:00:38.669
Here we go.

00:00:38.669 --> 00:00:39.949
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: It's because I come from a mirror
universe.

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:41.850
&gt;&gt;Galpin: That makes sense, that makes sense.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.510
Yeah, that would explain a lot, actually.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.699
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Actually, I'm pretty sure Dan's
from the mirror universe, 'cause he has the

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:48.850
Spock evil twin beard going.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:49.850
&gt;&gt;Galpin: That's true.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.789
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Dude, that's not the Spock evil
beard!

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:54.289
That's the plantation owner beard.

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:56.079
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Oh, that's what that is.

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:57.079
Yeah, I see.

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.710
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: In fact, this shouldn't say Dan
Galpin, it should say Colonel Dan Galpin.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:01.710
&gt;&gt;Galpin: That's right.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.420
It does look kinda like Colonel Sanders, doesn't
it?

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.780
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: It does indeed, my friend.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.579
&gt;&gt;Galpin: In his younger years, before it
came up in 11 herbs and spices.

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:09.579
All right.

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:10.579
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:12.270
It was nine herbs and spices back then.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.770
Speaking of herbs and spices--

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.920
&gt;&gt;Galpin: They discovered the other two at
that point.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.530
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: [laughs] Let's bring in our special
guest.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.530
[pause]

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:19.530
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Special gue--?

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.530
Oh!

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.530
Yes, absolutely.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.530
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: We have a special guest every
week.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.530
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Special guest, I know.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.200
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: So today, we are drinking Hoogstraten
Poorter.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.200
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Oooooh.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.759
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Which may or may not be good.

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:32.130
I don't know.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.500
&gt;&gt;Galpin: All right.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.000
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: You can see it's-- the bottle
is resealable.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Ooooh.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.240
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: So if we don't drink it all--

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.320
&gt;&gt;Galpin: That's right.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.670
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: That's [laughs] that's a useless
expense.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.670
&gt;&gt;Galpin: That's not going to happen.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:43.670
Yeah.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:44.670
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: That's pretty needless right there.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.979
We have some great apps today.

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.899
Dan and Co talked last time, and they're like,
"Screw this whole theme thing."

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:51.899
&gt;&gt;Galpin: That's right.

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.220
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: "We're just going to go with whatever
the viewers want."

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.220
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Exactly.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.611
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: And by viewers, we mean whoever
had enough friends to nominate something and

00:01:59.611 --> 00:02:00.611
get it voted up.

00:02:00.611 --> 00:02:02.630
We've got some good stuff today, I think.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.070
Oh, and we also have our new high tech title
system.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.070
Watch this.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.070
[pause] Whee!

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.070
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Oooooh.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.110
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: So that's what we're going to
watch.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.930
That's what we're going to talk about today.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.200
And I have to-- Oh yeah, yeah.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.380
I'm supposed to be sitting over here.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.380
Right.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.380
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Right, I know, I know.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.380
This is all challenging.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.380
All right.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.380
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: No, we're totally good, we're
totally good.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.380
We just have less space.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.220
So, we're talking-- we're going to be talking
about Pearls Deluxe, Asuri Tower Defense,

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.230
Sacracy RPG, Patentia, and Offroad Legends.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.120
That's a lot to get through, so let's start
up our super duper sports center title sequence.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.590
Okay, well, that's all there is.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.770
&gt;&gt;Galpin: What?

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:46.870
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: But I totally downloaded the demo
version of Aftereffects last night.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:47.870
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah?

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.770
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: So if I get some time over the
weekend, who knows what amazing things might

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:53.770
happen?

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.110
&gt;&gt;Galpin: There might be some amazing, cool
stuff.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.110
All right.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.010
I've now put them on in the right order here.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.840
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: [beer glugs] Your beer, sir.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.060
&gt;&gt;Galpin: There we are.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.060
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: All right.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.060
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Oh!

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.060
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Indeed.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.060
Okay, so let's start with Pearls Deluxe.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:12.470
Now, Pearls Deluxe is a game that reminds
me a lot of something I've seen before.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.200
Did we play Pearls the non-Deluxe version
at some point, or?

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.750
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I don't know.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.120
I thought you were going to say, "Pearls Deluxe
has got the most washed out looking feature

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.563
graphic that I've ever seen."

00:03:23.563 --> 00:03:24.563
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: That is an issue, yeah.

00:03:24.563 --> 00:03:29.650
You may-- A lot of things about this feature
graphic are good.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:30.650
It's definitely legible.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:31.650
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:32.650
Yeah.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.650
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: But it's-- it could maybe--

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.970
&gt;&gt;Galpin: It looks like it's been-- Not only
does it look washed out, but also, it looks

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.070
like it's just been scaled up rather than
scaled down, which--

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.260
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Oh, really?

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.260
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.990
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Well, that may actually be my
fault.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.600
I may have actually put it on a different
resolution.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.390
&gt;&gt;Galpin: No, no, I looked at it on Google.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:48.390
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Oh, okay.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.390
All right.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.390
&gt;&gt;Galpin: It's kinda fuzzy looking.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:51.390
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: All right.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.010
So obviously, a great feature graphic is important.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.990
But it's particularly important if you want
to get featured.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.990
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yes.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.730
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Now, let's talk about Pearls Deluxe.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.400
So Pearls Deluxe ended up being a really fun
game, I think.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.520
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Absolutely.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.750
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Do you play it much?

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.290
Oh, it doesn't support--

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.940
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, we're going to play--

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.410
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: We're going to just put this down,
I think.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.740
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Play it like that, just so we don't
jiggle the HDMI, 'cause it's-- Okay.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:15.740
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yep.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:16.740
Oh, that's funny.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.350
I put it down at an angle, and then I looked
at this, and I thought, "Oh no!

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.350
How-- wait.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:21.519
How is that at an angle?"

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.270
And it's just the way it works.

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.660
So yeah.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:31.740
Pearls Deluxe is a-- it's a slight twist on
your typical bubble popping game.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:32.740
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.669
Actually, I think it's a pretty significant
twist.

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:42.990
Basically, what you have to do is create sequences
of paths that have to cover all of the dots--

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:49.741
you can't-- all of the pearls that are the
same color that are touching each other, but

00:04:49.741 --> 00:04:56.680
also have to be in a line that goes straight
through without any turns or diagonals.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.650
So, it's impossible to pick up--

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:59.650
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Well, without any backtracking,
yes.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:00.650
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Without any backtracking.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:01.650
It's impossible.

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:02.650
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: So for instance, this one you
can't do.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:03.650
&gt;&gt;Galpin: You can't do.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:04.650
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Uh-uh!

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:05.650
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Uh-uh!

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:06.650
Exactly.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:07.650
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: And they have a really, really
cute sound effects that we can't play because

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:08.650
of the man.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:09.650
All right.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:10.650
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Exactly.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.139
Ooh, there's a big one over there on the--

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:13.139
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: There is?

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:14.139
Oh, let's see.

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:15.139
Ooooh, yeah.

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:16.139
Nice!

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:17.139
Okay.

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:18.139
Yeah.

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:23.629
So what I like about this twist is that it's
not just a change in the way it's played from

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:25.099
a mechanics level.

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:27.639
It does affect your strategy deeply.

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:28.870
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, absolutely.

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.620
And it's-- You can definitely screw yourself
up and get to a point where's there's just

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.450
nothing you can pop anymore, if you're not
careful.

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.539
Also, there's a timer throughout the game,
as we just saw.

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:41.719
So just some general comments about the game:
1.

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:46.009
This is an example of what happens when you
don't actually look at the ad on a tablet

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:47.009
device.

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:48.539
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:51.300
Your ad network is probably not going to be
happy with you for that.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.561
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I think it's more of a-- You're
probably-- People aren't even going to know

00:05:55.561 --> 00:05:56.689
that it is-- Maybe they'll get some clicks
that way, I don't know.

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:59.620
But I suspect you'll get fewer clicks if people
can't read the ad.

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:00.939
But you never know.

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:02.479
I never know what really works with these
things.

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:05.280
So that's definitely one thing to look at.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.669
Now, what is the share button do?

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:07.870
I didn't actually try it.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:08.990
I'm a little bit terrified.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.470
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Well, that is a share intent,
actually.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:11.840
&gt;&gt;Galpin: It is a share intent.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:12.840
That's good.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.160
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: But you've also got a Facebook
button.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.440
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Which takes you to the website.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.440
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.520
We're not super thrilled with that.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:26.009
And let me be really clear: it has nothing
to do with the particular social network.

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:30.560
If this was a Google+ button, we would feel
exactly the same way.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:38.249
It's just [pause] there's already a share
intent, and adding extra stuff on there, especially

00:06:38.249 --> 00:06:41.810
something that's going to take you out of
the game and launch a web browser, which is

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.720
almost always going to take a long time to
start up, and it uses battery, and it uses

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:46.720
data.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.720
Why?

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.800
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, it's one of the things where
it's also a question of where you want to

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.870
actually launch it in an external browser,
launch it in a web view.

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:56.309
I don't even know what you wanted to do in
this case.

00:06:56.309 --> 00:07:00.990
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah, it's like-- And the thing
is, part of it is the fact that there's already

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:04.909
the share intent available, but I understand
that there's a difference between liking something

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:07.240
or +1ing something and sharing it.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:12.599
But if you look at how these buttons work
on websites, when you +1 something, or when

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:15.340
you like something, that's a single action.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.520
You just press that button and you're done.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.879
It's supposed to be a very, very lightweight
action.

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:22.659
But here, you've changed something that's
supposed to be lightweight, and you've made

00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:24.100
it extremely heavyweight.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:25.449
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Exactly, exactly.

00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:27.270
I completely agree with you.

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:30.190
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Basically, I liked you when I
press that button, but by the time the web

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:32.449
browser launched, I no longer like you.

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:33.470
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Exactly.

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:37.699
You just have to be that much more enthusiastic
about the game to actually get to the liking

00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:38.699
phase.

00:07:38.699 --> 00:07:39.699
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Exactly.

00:07:39.699 --> 00:07:40.699
It is a pretty good game, though.

00:07:40.699 --> 00:07:42.860
&gt;&gt;Galpin: It is, it is.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.930
In general, it behaves reasonably well.

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:47.590
Nothing wrong with this.

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:48.729
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: All right.

00:07:48.729 --> 00:07:53.169
&gt;&gt;Galpin: So in terms of what happens when
you press the back key here.

00:07:53.169 --> 00:07:54.719
Reasonable.

00:07:54.719 --> 00:07:58.360
Again, it looks like a dialog, and there we
are.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.360
Back at our home screen.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.360
So not too bad.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.370
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Now, in sharp contrast to that,
let's take a look at our next game.

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:11.039
So Asuri Tower Defense, I have to admit, it
reeeeally got my hopes up.

00:08:11.039 --> 00:08:12.889
&gt;&gt;Galpin: You are a tower defense fanatic.

00:08:12.889 --> 00:08:14.620
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: I love tower defense!

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:15.620
And when I saw--

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:19.039
&gt;&gt;Galpin: This is the man who purchased tons
and tons of items in Radiant Defense.

00:08:19.039 --> 00:08:21.740
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: I purchased every item in Radiant
Defense.

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:22.740
Absolutely.

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:23.740
Got every upgrade.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:25.950
So I would love to have a game like that again.

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:27.389
I still play Radiant Defense sometimes.

00:08:27.389 --> 00:08:29.539
I'm up to 13 million.

00:08:29.539 --> 00:08:30.539
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Exactly.

00:08:30.539 --> 00:08:33.010
So you have the right reviewer here for this
one, is what I'm saying.

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:36.030
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: And then I looked at the feature
graphic and I'm like, "That looks pretty promising.

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:39.070
That's got some nice-- It's a little dated,
but not bad."

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:43.640
I looked at this, and I'm like, "Whoa, hell
yeah!"

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.830
Asuri TD is an awesome new strategic tower
defense game filled with action.

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:50.950
Asuri Tower Defense is an awesome new tower
defense game.

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:51.950
Okay.

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:54.770
It's the unique strategy game and full of
action.

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:56.730
&gt;&gt;Galpin: You'll never have a dull moment
while playing it.

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.410
You may have other tower defense games--

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:00.620
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: [yelling] But Asuri is the ultimate
tower defense game and brings you to places

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:05.890
with a unique story mode! [normal voice] I
was excited.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:09.590
&gt;&gt;Galpin: We love the idea that if you repeat
a keyword a whole bunch in the description,

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:11.370
it's more likely to be found by us.

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:12.510
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: That's not actually true now.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:13.510
&gt;&gt;Galpin: It's not.

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:17.120
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: It's actually less likely, because
we think it's spam.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.510
But here's the thing--

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:20.490
&gt;&gt;Galpin: The general thing: don't do it.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:24.490
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: I think you could forgive me for
getting my hopes up once I read this.

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:25.640
Now, once I read the--

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.050
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I read it and I looked at it.

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:30.880
Why are they spelling "tower defense" multiple
ways within their description?

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:31.880
Maybe--

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:37.210
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: My guess is they're from India
and they're-- they've still got a bunch of

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:39.530
leftovers from their former British masters.

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:40.743
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Well, it was interesting to me.

00:09:40.743 --> 00:09:41.743
They spelled it both ways.

00:09:41.743 --> 00:09:45.150
And I was thinking, maybe they wanted to make
sure they got both keywords or something.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:46.150
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: It's possible.

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:47.150
Yeah.

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:48.150
&gt;&gt;Galpin: But our system is smart.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:49.350
I don't think that's actually necessary.

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:50.350
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:55.900
In any case, I got to the part about the story
plot, and I'm like, "Oh, a story plot."

00:09:55.900 --> 00:10:00.000
And then it says, "The story is about a hero
and Rose, they travel through space and time,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
they start to like each other."

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.290
That's "hmmm."

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:05.680
And then I read the reviews.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.160
And here's where it got interesting for me.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.160
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Okay, okay.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.230
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: I read the reviews and I noticed
they had a very good rating.

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:13.230
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Okay.

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:20.890
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: I noticed that there are two reviews
left by random people with random names that

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:24.080
say, "This game is not worth your time.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.200
It's absolute rubbish."

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.950
Okay.

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:34.400
There are then three reviews that are extremely
complementary, all of which have Indian names.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.400
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Ah!

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.400
Okay.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.510
Well, maybe it's just designed to appeal to
that demographic.

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:39.290
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: That is completely possible.

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:41.210
Or it might very well be that the dude's Indian,
and--

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:43.080
&gt;&gt;Galpin: The demographic of their friends,
exactly.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.080
It could be.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.080
That happens.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:49.190
If you have a small enough sample set, your
friends can actually alter the--

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:50.190
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:57.380
I guess what I'm saying is if you're going
to pack reviews with your friends, make sure

00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:04.250
that they've got distinctive names, instead
of just-- The same family name, that's a tip-off.

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:07.550
Anyway, let's take a look at the game.

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:13.900
Now, the thing about tower defense-- Oh, now
this is where it goes wrong.

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:16.210
Can you take my overlay off?

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:18.880
[pause] Beautiful.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.020
See, that's what we get for having a professional
engineer.

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.760
&gt;&gt;Galpin: You can get rid of us, actually,
momentarily.

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:28.580
'Cause I think people should-- [game music
playing] --screen without our faces-- No!

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:29.580
We're back!

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:30.580
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: There are some--

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:35.760
&gt;&gt;Meier: You did say "momentarily."

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:41.090
&gt;&gt;Galpin: [laughs] [game music playing]

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:47.150
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Unfortunately, they're further
behind [game music playing] that I would probably

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:48.150
like.

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:59.490
It's covered with these gigantic, fake, Comic
Sans, bubbly, in a sort of 1995 way buttons,

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:01.620
which is just horrible.

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:05.640
And they've got their own take on the blink
tag.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:09.170
So kudos there.

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:13.730
There's also something on the title screen
that says, "When experiencing lag in game,

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:17.610
consider to turn off music and/or sound by
clicking sound icons."

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:18.610
[pause]

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:22.740
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Are those the icons here, or are
those the icons in the game?

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:24.710
I think this may be the--

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:25.710
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: I don't care.

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:26.710
I don't care at all.

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:28.190
This is an ugly title screen.

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:29.190
Fix it.

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:31.700
You need to fix that.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:36.551
You've also reused the exact same set of 9-patches,
apparently, for-- Or is that even 9-patches?

00:12:36.551 --> 00:12:37.890
I'm not sure.

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:43.230
For these buttons on the left- and right-hand
side of the screen, where they look very inappropriate.

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:46.530
&gt;&gt;Galpin: The big button on the left that
says back is kinda pointless, isn't it?

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:51.400
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: This is one of the cases that
we've said that just because you got yourself

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:56.460
a demo copy of Photoshop and you know how
to use the gradient tool, does not mean that

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:59.080
you're going to make a beautiful glass UI.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:02.320
It's a lot easier to put together something
that looks like this.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.260
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I'm totally betting on the gimp
right now.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.290
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: You think this is a gimp?

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:07.290
Oh, yeah.

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:08.290
&gt;&gt;Galpin: But anyways.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:10.780
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: It doesn't have a cheesy embossing
effect, at least.

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:12.450
And then, they have a start here--

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:13.450
&gt;&gt;Galpin: [unintelligible]

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:18.540
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: They have a start here, which
is nice, because I wouldn't have known, although

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:23.830
I will say that the blue arrow here, below
the start here button, is almost invisible.

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:27.240
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I do kinda like the effect, the
pixelation effect, they've got going over

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.240
there.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.220
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: So this is kinda cool.

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:33.940
Definitely needs some-- a little bit of thinking
about fonts.

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:38.730
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Actually, I would just like it to
be rendering the font on the device.

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:40.780
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Right, that would help too.

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:44.000
&gt;&gt;Galpin: That actually would make a huge
difference in all of these things.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.890
You may not be able to tell out there in viewer
land, but the font is really low res.

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:48.890
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: You know, it's interesting.

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:53.850
I actually-- That slipped past me, and this
whole time I've been thinking, "Well, I guess

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:58.060
it makes sense that the fonts look crappy
because I must just not be looking at it at

00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:59.870
the resolution it was offered."

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:00.870
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Oh, okay.

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:01.870
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: But no.

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:02.870
They actually baked these fonts in.

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:03.870
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:05.440
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: So this is great.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.390
Again, you need to have a designer on this.

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:10.390
[pause]

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:11.390
&gt;&gt;Galpin: [unintelligible]

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:16.890
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Okay, this is-- Again, some really--
You know, here, for instance--

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:18.410
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Now we have high res fonts, which
is cool.

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:24.880
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: So we've got a lot of text here
that is not well planned out.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:29.070
For instance, "resources", the word is actually
broken in--

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:30.850
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah.

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:32.630
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Right?

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:39.530
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I guess-- I don't even know what
to say about this, other than "Wow."

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:40.880
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:47.250
When you actually get into the game, again,
we've got a weird mix of somewhat attractive

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:50.630
graphics and things that aren't attractive
at all.

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:53.310
It's not at all apparent how I start the game.

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:57.950
I seem to remember that I finally clicked
over here.

00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:01.910
And then I'm going to build some stuff here.

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:02.910
Build some towers.

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:07.130
&gt;&gt;Galpin: It seems like it was an amazing
amount of text to not tell you anything useful

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:11.360
about-- Oh I guess you don't have any more
funds left to build.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.360
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.360
Right, right.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:17.590
Now, in this case, there's a couple of things
that I have to object to.

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:20.320
The individual pieces of art are okay.

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:23.820
The animation is disappointing.

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:31.240
The [pause] death graphics are kinda cool.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.940
You've got a little explosion.

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:39.070
But you'll notice they don't remove the sprite
until after the explosion animation finishes,

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:40.070
which completely breaks the--

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:44.610
&gt;&gt;Galpin: It'd be so much cooler to fade the
sprite out during the explosion, at least.

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:45.800
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah, absolutely.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:51.600
Generally, you should be-- what you really
want to do is take your sprite, get rid of

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:57.340
the unit sprite as soon as it dies, and replace
it with something else, whether it's the explosion,

00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:03.080
or something that shows it breaking up, or
something that fades out, or whatever.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:06.340
Also, these laser beams, I'm not buying 'em.

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:07.520
They're not exciting.

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:11.510
These things aren't taking damage in any obvious
way.

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:14.940
Even the health bars are very, very hard to
see.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:15.940
And some--

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:18.180
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I like the little explosions when
they reach your base, though.

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.180
That's kinda cool.

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:22.480
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: It is cool, but it'd be great--
I mean, they completely cover the unit.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.590
Why isn't the unit being removed under cover
of that explosion?

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:27.210
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I agree.

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:28.722
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: It's odd.

00:16:28.722 --> 00:16:31.010
&gt;&gt;Galpin: It's odd because a lot of these
things seem really easy to do.

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:32.010
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:35.940
&gt;&gt;Galpin: It's like, this is fairly-- Forget
you got this really cool little water effect

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:40.260
there on the other side, which I'm sure someone
spent a little bit of time actually thinking

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:41.260
about doing.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:42.260
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:46.930
I mean, it feels like they've got some talent,
but it's just very, very uneven.

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:52.320
And when I played this on my Nexus 7, it actually
had an interesting bug where they would reach

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:57.590
the heart, here, which is the endpoint, and
actually just turn around and go back.

00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:59.410
They wouldn't die until they got all the way
back.

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:00.410
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Wow.

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:02.120
That seems like that actually requires some
really interesting pathing.

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.420
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:05.790
&gt;&gt;Galpin: That's cool, but odd.

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:06.980
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah, indeed.

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:07.980
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Exactly.

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.760
I wonder if that's-- huh.

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:10.949
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Essentially, yeah.

00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:12.020
This isn't grabbing me.

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:22.490
It's also-- It starts out very difficult,
and continues to be difficult, and then doesn't

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:25.600
really give you any payoff for that difficulty.

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:30.289
So I have to admit that while I love tower
defense games and I really wanted to like

00:17:30.289 --> 00:17:32.090
this one, I didn't play past the first level.

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:33.090
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Ah.

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:34.090
So--

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:35.820
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: If the second level's awesome,
mess with me--

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:39.120
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Well, I'm hoping that this story
actually continues on.

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.360
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: I don't want the story.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.740
Some guy falls in love with a girl.

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:44.539
I hate those things.

00:17:44.539 --> 00:17:45.539
Stories.

00:17:45.539 --> 00:17:47.249
&gt;&gt;Galpin: All right, all right.

00:17:47.249 --> 00:17:48.249
That's that.

00:17:48.249 --> 00:17:52.100
It sounds like there's the core of a lot of
ideas there that could be polished up into

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:53.100
the game.

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:54.100
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:57.350
Now, this is probably a good time to mention
that our good friend and producer Alex is

00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:02.720
online watching the YouTube video-- I have
to check, because last time he was getting

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:03.720
his email and stuff.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.139
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, I know, I know.

00:18:05.139 --> 00:18:08.309
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Producer Alex is sitting there,
bitter, because Dan finally showed up.

00:18:08.309 --> 00:18:10.250
And so he didn't get to do the game show.

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:11.749
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Did you play his games, Alex?

00:18:11.749 --> 00:18:12.749
&gt;&gt;Alexander Lucas: Yeah.

00:18:12.749 --> 00:18:14.100
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: No, but he grew a beard.

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.399
&gt;&gt;Lucas: I played them all too.

00:18:15.399 --> 00:18:16.399
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Okay.

00:18:16.399 --> 00:18:21.610
Well, comment: what did you think of Asuri
TD, because I didn't-- that was the one I

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:23.070
actually didn't have time to play.

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:24.929
&gt;&gt;Lucas: Pretty much everything Ian said.

00:18:24.929 --> 00:18:28.410
One interesting thing they do have going for
them, though, is zero permissions.

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:29.410
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Nice!

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:30.410
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: That is cool.

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:31.410
&gt;&gt;Galpin: All right.

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:32.410
A thumbs up to that.

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:33.410
&gt;&gt;Lucas: That's impressive.

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:34.410
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Thank you guys.

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:37.190
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: By the way, Alex, we're not to
your left.

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:39.370
We're right in front of you.

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:40.370
Yeah, totally.

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:41.370
Okay.

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:42.370
All right.

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:43.990
So let's go-- Oh, actually, you know what?

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:46.110
I have to mention one other thing.

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:52.190
Asuri TD-- Now, this does not apply to the
full version, which, for all I know, is completely

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:53.980
different and better.

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:56.519
But, you know, whatever.

00:18:56.519 --> 00:18:59.409
[pause] What is up with this icon?

00:18:59.409 --> 00:19:02.670
You don't need to put the name of your app
in the icon.

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:03.670
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah.

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:04.670
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: That's sorta a waste of space.

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:07.480
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Could you go to the screen, Reto?

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.870
Just switch over to the tablet, because I
just want to show this icon off.

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:12.309
Because it is kinda special.

00:19:12.309 --> 00:19:15.730
And I noticed the actual-- the Asuri TD paid
icon is actually pretty cool.

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:16.730
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah, yeah.

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:17.730
It's all right.

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:19.440
&gt;&gt;Galpin: It looks better and it doesn't have
the name in there.

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.440
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:21.440
The free one-- yeah.

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.440
It feels like--

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.720
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Does the menu look better too?

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.360
I'm curious.

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:27.360
You know?

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:28.620
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: No, no.

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:29.620
It's exactly the same.

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:32.250
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Well, it doesn't have the "buy"
thing at the top, which makes it look better.

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:33.250
But yeah.

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:34.250
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Well, that's true.

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:35.250
Starting the-- yeah, yeah.

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:36.250
It's all the same.

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:37.250
&gt;&gt;Galpin: It is.

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:38.250
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:39.250
Okay.

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:40.250
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Okay.

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:41.250
Anyways, just thought it'd be worth checking
out.

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:42.250
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: All right.

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:45.080
Well, let's go ahead and move on, then, to
Sacracy, I guess.

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.470
Or "Sac-racey"?

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:47.470
I don't know?

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:48.639
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I'm going to go with "Sac-rahcy."

00:19:48.639 --> 00:19:49.639
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Okay.

00:19:49.639 --> 00:19:52.760
So Sacracy, apparently, is a location-based
action RPG.

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:57.470
Now, I didn't play this because, as an ethereal
being, I have no location.

00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:58.700
But Dan did.

00:19:58.700 --> 00:19:59.700
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah.

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:05.169
This is going to be fun because-- I'm turning
on location here.

00:20:05.169 --> 00:20:06.980
I didn't actually try the location.

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:09.830
[pause] [whispers] "Mock locations aren't
allowed.

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:11.249
Please disable mock."

00:20:11.249 --> 00:20:12.249
All right.

00:20:12.249 --> 00:20:15.519
I'm going to go to couch mode.

00:20:15.519 --> 00:20:16.519
Come back!

00:20:16.519 --> 00:20:17.519
All right.

00:20:17.519 --> 00:20:18.519
Okay.

00:20:18.519 --> 00:20:20.399
So I actually never got to see the location
software in the game.

00:20:20.399 --> 00:20:23.590
I have no idea whether it has any relevance
to the gameplay.

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:32.049
It doesn't feel like it will, but that's just--
that being said, the game is set in this 16

00:20:32.049 --> 00:20:36.990
bit styled fantasy world that we're looking
at here.

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:37.990
And it has--

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:38.990
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: That's kinda cool.

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:42.110
&gt;&gt;Galpin: And it has touch controls that move
you ever so slowly through the board.

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:43.450
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Ooooh.

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:44.700
&gt;&gt;Galpin: And because of--

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:48.080
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: So is this one of those games
that advertises there's like 30 hours of gameplay

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.450
and 29 of them are spent walking from one
place to another?

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:51.450
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah.

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:54.789
And I'm here at this temple, and you see I
just killed off someone.

00:20:54.789 --> 00:20:57.869
It doesn't actually go through explaining
how to actually play the game.

00:20:57.869 --> 00:21:01.450
It has a tutorial that explains what you're
supposed to do next.

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:05.899
Like, as you go through, it's like, "All right,
now find this skeleton and kill him, but it

00:21:05.899 --> 00:21:06.899
doesn't actually explain how.

00:21:06.899 --> 00:21:07.899
It turns out--

00:21:07.899 --> 00:21:08.899
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Isn't that just an old dude?

00:21:08.899 --> 00:21:11.460
So it's like some random senior citizen that
you just killed?

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:14.409
&gt;&gt;Galpin: It's not clear why that guy was
attacking me.

00:21:14.409 --> 00:21:15.409
He might--

00:21:15.409 --> 00:21:16.409
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Oh, he was attacking you?

00:21:16.409 --> 00:21:17.580
Is that what you're trying to go with?

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.020
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, yeah, he was actually.

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:20.540
&gt;&gt;Meier: That's his defense, anyway.

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:21.540
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah.

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:22.540
Oh!

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:23.540
Now that looks like a zombie.

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:24.540
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Maybe a Frankenstein.

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:25.690
&gt;&gt;Galpin: It's kinda cool looking.

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:27.379
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Oh, no, no, it's like a zombie
knight, I think.

00:21:27.379 --> 00:21:31.169
&gt;&gt;Galpin: It looks like I might have gotten
poisoned, 'cause I'm all green.

00:21:31.169 --> 00:21:33.970
Anyways, the game mechanics are actually pretty
basic.

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:35.809
The graphics are definitely a combination.

00:21:35.809 --> 00:21:40.240
They remind me of Ultima 5 or Ultima 6.

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.240
[unintelligible]

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.240
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: You know what?

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.700
This is actually-- I think this is the first
game of sort that I've actually liked the

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:50.201
graphics, because usually, my attitude is,
"Okay, dude, if you're going to go retro,

00:21:50.201 --> 00:21:55.659
go full retro" because if you go retro but
higher res, it just ends up looking stupid.

00:21:55.659 --> 00:21:57.679
But these guys totally pulled it off.

00:21:57.679 --> 00:22:01.269
It looks retro, and yet it's really high res
and it looks good.

00:22:01.269 --> 00:22:02.269
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah.

00:22:02.269 --> 00:22:05.330
And you know, there's lots of really, really
nice touches in the graphics of this game.

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:08.320
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: And I'm really digging that temple
that's right under my arm.

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:09.320
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah.

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:12.850
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Move over so it gets-- so the
viewers can actually see it.

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:13.850
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah.

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:15.129
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: That looks cool.

00:22:15.129 --> 00:22:19.510
&gt;&gt;Galpin: While the game did drive me crazy
with this actual play of the game and the

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:24.789
[slowed voice] very, very slow pacing of these
early scenes, and the semi-bewildered state

00:22:24.789 --> 00:22:25.789
of what I'm supposed to be doing in the game--

00:22:25.789 --> 00:22:31.090
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: I assume you're supposed to be
killing everything, and then taking whatever's

00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:32.090
not nailed down.

00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:33.090
Can you go inside the temple?

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:36.080
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Not that I was able to actually
find out.

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:37.119
I tried doing it.

00:22:37.119 --> 00:22:38.740
It didn't seem like I could go in the temple.

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:40.159
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Is that dude associated with the
temple?

00:22:40.159 --> 00:22:41.490
Is it like a friar or something?

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:42.490
Don't kill him!

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:43.490
&gt;&gt;Galpin: No, I know.

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:44.649
That's the-- If he-- Now I know--

00:22:44.649 --> 00:22:45.649
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Oh, okay.

00:22:45.649 --> 00:22:46.649
&gt;&gt;Galpin: "Welcome.

00:22:46.649 --> 00:22:47.649
What is it that leads you here?"

00:22:47.649 --> 00:22:48.649
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: [inhales]

00:22:48.649 --> 00:22:51.320
&gt;&gt;Galpin: "You say there are resurrecting
creatures?

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:52.320
Just as it was predicted.

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.071
Only an ancient ritual can free us from this
horror.

00:22:54.071 --> 00:22:55.071
I will beg the gods for help."

00:22:55.071 --> 00:22:58.720
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: I'm going to say right now: that
is pretty, and I love the font, but it's not

00:22:58.720 --> 00:22:59.720
a font.

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:00.720
It's a bitmap.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.249
And it's really, really small on this device.

00:23:02.249 --> 00:23:03.249
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah.

00:23:03.249 --> 00:23:04.249
That's what-- Definitely.

00:23:04.249 --> 00:23:07.740
It actually might be a font, but if it is,
it's being rendered really small.

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:08.740
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:09.740
A little too small.

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:10.970
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I can't actually tell.

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:15.279
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: The rest of the UI is actually,
I would say, it's as small as it possibly

00:23:15.279 --> 00:23:16.769
could be, but it's not too small.

00:23:16.769 --> 00:23:18.730
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, it actually works pretty well
in this screen.

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:21.750
What's kinda cool about this game-- and we'll
try not to lose HDMI in this.

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:22.750
Maybe we can't do it here.

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:23.750
--is that this game--

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:25.659
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Oh, no, yeah, you can't rotate
while you're--

00:23:25.659 --> 00:23:29.750
&gt;&gt;Galpin: You can't rotate while-- So this
game will actually play in both portrait and

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:30.750
landscape.

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:31.750
It has to do with--

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:32.750
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Now, that's nice.

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:33.750
Yeah.

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:35.820
And it's-- I mean, why wouldn't a game like
this be able to do that?

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:36.820
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Absolutely.

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:37.820
Now, it does have audio on the lock screen.

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:38.820
I will say that.

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:39.820
Which was maybe kinda sad.

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:40.820
And the game--

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:42.720
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: We've been beating that drum for
a looooong time.

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.249
&gt;&gt;Lucas: It has audio when you leave the application.

00:23:44.249 --> 00:23:45.249
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Oh, yeah, yeah!

00:23:45.249 --> 00:23:46.249
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, yeah.

00:23:46.249 --> 00:23:49.610
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah, there were a ton of people
complaining about this.

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:54.090
And this is an example of something-- Like,
we get really, really anal about things like

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:56.860
no audio in the lock screen.

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:59.269
There's good reasons for that, but nobody's
going--

00:23:59.269 --> 00:24:01.059
&gt;&gt;Galpin: You should get really, really anal
about audio in the app.

00:24:01.059 --> 00:24:03.679
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: If you can't-- Yeah, you can't
kill the audio?

00:24:03.679 --> 00:24:05.289
It's just playing all the time?

00:24:05.289 --> 00:24:06.289
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah.

00:24:06.289 --> 00:24:11.230
If you don't exit and log out of the app,
it keeps going until the system accidentally

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:12.340
kills the app for whatever reason.

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:14.090
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah, you might want to take care
of that.

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:16.049
I think it would actually boost your sales.

00:24:16.049 --> 00:24:22.070
&gt;&gt;Galpin: The other thing to note is that
there is a theory, a way to get to other aspects

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:24.450
of your character without doing this, but
I couldn't find it.

00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:26.909
There's a lot of controls that are sitting
underneath the menu key.

00:24:26.909 --> 00:24:27.909
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Okay.

00:24:27.909 --> 00:24:30.470
&gt;&gt;Galpin: And there's a lot of stuff here
underneath the menu key.

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:36.259
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: And like Reto and I just pointed
out on the last show, on the App Clinic, using

00:24:36.259 --> 00:24:41.179
the menu key is problematic because it is
implemented in different ways across different

00:24:41.179 --> 00:24:42.179
devices.

00:24:42.179 --> 00:24:47.299
So if you can get rid of it and move to either
an on-screen button or an action bar pattern,

00:24:47.299 --> 00:24:51.210
or something else that is predictable, that's
what we would recommend at this point.

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:52.210
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah.

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:56.019
I mean, given that you guys have a lot of
space, you could be using, to pull up these

00:24:56.019 --> 00:24:57.019
kinds of--

00:24:57.019 --> 00:24:58.380
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Well, and they've got eight freaking
other buttons too.

00:24:58.380 --> 00:24:59.410
It's not like they're--

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:00.570
&gt;&gt;Galpin: No, exactly.

00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:02.809
It's not like this is a menu that's devoid
of buttons.

00:25:02.809 --> 00:25:05.889
But the main problem with this is that they're
just not very discoverable.

00:25:05.889 --> 00:25:08.909
And it's actually kinda a pain to go here
to get to my inventory.

00:25:08.909 --> 00:25:12.419
Now, there's supposedly a green jewel that
I can click on to get to the inventory.

00:25:12.419 --> 00:25:14.029
I don't see it.

00:25:14.029 --> 00:25:15.029
But--

00:25:15.029 --> 00:25:16.029
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Green jewel.

00:25:16.029 --> 00:25:17.029
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Green jewel.

00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:18.759
[rustling sound] And this was the one.

00:25:18.759 --> 00:25:20.963
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: There's-- But that's not a-- It
looks like a talk thing.

00:25:20.963 --> 00:25:21.963
&gt;&gt;Galpin: That's the chat.

00:25:21.963 --> 00:25:22.963
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah, it's the chat.

00:25:22.963 --> 00:25:23.963
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Exactly.

00:25:23.963 --> 00:25:25.320
So I'm not-- I don't--

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:26.320
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Well-- Oh, dude!

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:31.850
What if the color that you think is green
is actually what they think is red, dude?

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:32.980
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, I thought about that.

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:37.119
You click on here and you get to this backpack,
which is not the inventory.

00:25:37.119 --> 00:25:40.269
Oh, but I can get to it that way?

00:25:40.269 --> 00:25:41.269
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: See, that's a problem.

00:25:41.269 --> 00:25:43.880
Ideas that you come up with when you're high,
they never work out.

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:49.159
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

00:25:49.159 --> 00:25:51.730
Or maybe I don't know.

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:57.889
[laughs] My feeling is I wanted the game to
grab me faster with a story and an engaging

00:25:57.889 --> 00:25:58.889
game.

00:25:58.889 --> 00:26:02.059
Now, the-- I'm really curious about the location-based
stuff.

00:26:02.059 --> 00:26:08.059
There is actually-- And also with the tutorial
that really explained how to play, not to

00:26:08.059 --> 00:26:09.059
tell you what to do.

00:26:09.059 --> 00:26:10.059
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:26:10.059 --> 00:26:11.059
That would really help.

00:26:11.059 --> 00:26:12.279
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I really wanted "Tap on the skeleton.

00:26:12.279 --> 00:26:16.389
You'll find the skeleton in the map because
he's blinking in the corner."

00:26:16.389 --> 00:26:17.389
You know?

00:26:17.389 --> 00:26:21.360
The map will show a map of the world around
you, because we're actually in a parallel

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:22.749
universe, and that's what we're seeing here.

00:26:22.749 --> 00:26:23.919
All that kind of stuff--

00:26:23.919 --> 00:26:25.000
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Really, that's the whole story?

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.850
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I think that actually is what's
going on, but I don't--

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:29.850
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Niiiiiice.

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:30.850
&gt;&gt;Galpin: But I don't completely know.

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:34.429
It's a little confusing.

00:26:34.429 --> 00:26:38.830
There's a lot-- This game really requires
probably five or six hours of deep exploration.

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:43.980
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Here's the other thing that I
just want to mention, and it's a little nit,

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:53.889
and wouldn't get anybody fired or anything,
but [pause] but that's the word "temples"

00:26:53.889 --> 00:26:55.509
spelled out in Greek characters.

00:26:55.509 --> 00:26:56.889
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah.

00:26:56.889 --> 00:26:58.279
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Temple.

00:26:58.279 --> 00:26:59.659
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah.

00:26:59.659 --> 00:27:03.759
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: You know what, if you're going
to use Greek characters, learn Greek.

00:27:03.759 --> 00:27:05.149
It's not that hard.

00:27:05.149 --> 00:27:06.149
[pause]

00:27:06.149 --> 00:27:07.889
&gt;&gt;Lucas: It is kinda hard.

00:27:07.889 --> 00:27:08.909
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: What?

00:27:08.909 --> 00:27:10.453
&gt;&gt;Lucas: I think it's kinda hard.

00:27:10.453 --> 00:27:11.720
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: It's not hard at all!

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:12.720
&gt;&gt;Lucas: It is!

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:13.720
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: You are Greek!

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:14.720
&gt;&gt;Galpin: [laughs]

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:15.720
&gt;&gt;Lucas: I know!

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:16.720
I'm speaking with authority!

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:17.720
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: You're biased!

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.590
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Oh wait, hey, put the camera on
the Greek man, okay?

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:22.140
&gt;&gt;Meier: I actually want to ask a question,
Alex.

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:25.010
How old were you when you learned Greek?

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:28.989
&gt;&gt;Lucas: I don't really know Greek very well
because it's hard!

00:27:28.989 --> 00:27:29.989
&gt;&gt;Galpin: [laughs]

00:27:29.989 --> 00:27:30.989
&gt;&gt;Meier: Good answer.

00:27:30.989 --> 00:27:31.989
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Malacca.

00:27:31.989 --> 00:27:32.989
&gt;&gt;Galpin: It is Greek to him.

00:27:32.989 --> 00:27:33.989
There we are.

00:27:33.989 --> 00:27:34.989
All right.

00:27:34.989 --> 00:27:40.509
So thank you for being there as our Greek
correspondent.

00:27:40.509 --> 00:27:45.100
It's not often we get to take advantage of
that.

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:46.480
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: All right.

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:51.289
Let's move on, because this is obviously a
deep game, but it's just so slow that I--

00:27:51.289 --> 00:27:52.289
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Did you play this game, Alex, by
the way?

00:27:52.289 --> 00:27:53.289
&gt;&gt;Lucas: Yeah.

00:27:53.289 --> 00:27:54.779
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Any other comments you have on the
game?

00:27:54.779 --> 00:27:56.090
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Alex is there.

00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:57.090
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Sorry.

00:27:57.090 --> 00:27:58.679
Any other comments you have on the game?

00:27:58.679 --> 00:28:00.230
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: All right.

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:06.519
&gt;&gt;Lucas: Pretty much everything that you guys
said.

00:28:06.519 --> 00:28:07.519
I found it very slow to get started.

00:28:07.519 --> 00:28:08.519
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Okay.

00:28:08.519 --> 00:28:09.919
&gt;&gt;Lucas: And it was like the Lord of the Rings
thing where there's just a whole lot of walking.

00:28:09.919 --> 00:28:14.350
It's supposed to be an adventure, but it's
90% just walking.

00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:15.929
&gt;&gt;Galpin: [laughs] Without the poetry.

00:28:15.929 --> 00:28:17.330
&gt;&gt;Lucas: Right, without the poetry.

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:18.649
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: So there's a plus.

00:28:18.649 --> 00:28:20.559
But other than that, yeah.

00:28:20.559 --> 00:28:22.090
So this is something that--

00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:23.739
&gt;&gt;Galpin: And it's also an online game, by
the way.

00:28:23.739 --> 00:28:24.739
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:28:24.739 --> 00:28:28.279
&gt;&gt;Galpin: And I have also not yet gotten to
the really cool online features that I know

00:28:28.279 --> 00:28:29.950
must be there, other than the chat.

00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:31.549
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Well, but this is a good point.

00:28:31.549 --> 00:28:35.100
I mean, it's true that we review five games
a week.

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:39.739
We don't have to time necessarily to put huge
amounts of effort into each one.

00:28:39.739 --> 00:28:42.970
But then again, neither do the people that
you're hoping will purchase things.

00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:44.409
If we--

00:28:44.409 --> 00:28:47.559
&gt;&gt;Galpin: We have short attention spans, but
so does everyone.

00:28:47.559 --> 00:28:48.559
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Everyone, yeah.

00:28:48.559 --> 00:28:52.279
I attended a talk by John Romero last year.

00:28:52.279 --> 00:28:55.350
As you know-- I mean-- So John is obviously
famous for--

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:56.590
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Having a short attention span?

00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:57.590
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: No!

00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:58.590
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Oh.

00:28:58.590 --> 00:28:59.590
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: For Doom--

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:00.590
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I know, I know.

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:01.590
[laughs]

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:05.179
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah, for making an awesome game
called Doom and a crappy one called Daikatana.

00:29:05.179 --> 00:29:06.760
But recently, he's been in--

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:08.869
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Hey, I killed lots of frogs in Daikatana,
okay?

00:29:08.869 --> 00:29:14.039
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Lately, he's been in the Facebook
space, and he had some really, really good

00:29:14.039 --> 00:29:15.120
things to say.

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:22.779
He and his wife made a game whose title escapes
me at the moment, but it is very, very popular.

00:29:22.779 --> 00:29:27.610
And they pointed out that according to their
metrics, people gave you about 30 seconds

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:30.309
to a minute before they moved on to the next
thing.

00:29:30.309 --> 00:29:31.309
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Wow, okay.

00:29:31.309 --> 00:29:36.240
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: And so no matter how deep your
game is, if you can't grab someone in that

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:41.470
amount of time, it's very, very unlikely that
they will give you a second thought, because

00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:46.149
there are just so many things out there that
people can be entertained by.

00:29:46.149 --> 00:29:51.450
Why would they work hard to be entertained
by your system, if it takes a huge amount

00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:57.059
of grinding, when they could very easily go
to some other game and be entertained immediately?

00:29:57.059 --> 00:29:58.059
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Exactly.

00:29:58.059 --> 00:30:02.960
I just wanted to get grabbed by the story
more quickly.

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:06.149
Definitely the movement speed was driving
me just crazy in the game.

00:30:06.149 --> 00:30:08.590
And also, to be honest, it's really not clear
when you're fighting.

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:11.270
When you click-- So there's your 'click to
move' and 'click to fight', so you have to

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:15.809
actually stop moving, wait for the guy to
be there, then click him once you stop moving

00:30:15.809 --> 00:30:16.809
and he's next to you.

00:30:16.809 --> 00:30:18.309
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Well, that's just a poor interface
there.

00:30:18.309 --> 00:30:22.940
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I really wanted the interface to
be-- Even though I like the, in general, 'tap

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:27.039
to move where you want to go,' if you see
the monster's there, I really want the 'tap

00:30:27.039 --> 00:30:28.720
to walk up and start bludgeoning'.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:30.529
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah, I thought that was pretty
obvious.

00:30:30.529 --> 00:30:33.059
I mean, any mouse-based RPG, that's exactly
what you do.

00:30:33.059 --> 00:30:35.799
If you tap on an enemy, you will move to him
and start attacking.

00:30:35.799 --> 00:30:36.799
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah.

00:30:36.799 --> 00:30:37.850
Now here's what you-- That moves you to the
position.

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:40.570
You'll walk right through the enemy until
[coughs]

00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:41.690
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: That's nasty.

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:43.799
&gt;&gt;Lucas: That was the most awkward part for
me.

00:30:43.799 --> 00:30:46.700
I'd click on the skeleton, we'd start walking
toward each other, and then pass each other.

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:47.700
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: [laughs]

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:48.700
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah.

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:51.220
&gt;&gt;Lucas: The skeleton turns around and starts
bludgeoning me in the back, and I just keep

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:53.549
walking forward like I don't care.

00:30:53.549 --> 00:30:57.289
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Wow, that's like Starcraft UI.

00:30:57.289 --> 00:30:58.289
All right.

00:30:58.289 --> 00:30:59.779
You know what?

00:30:59.779 --> 00:31:02.359
We're just going to get madder and madder
the further we go with this.

00:31:02.359 --> 00:31:05.100
Let's talk about Patentia, which I actually
really enjoy.

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:06.820
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Patentia's super clever.

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:07.820
I love--

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:08.820
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:09.820
The guy said it was his first game.

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:10.820
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah.

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:15.169
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: And it's certainly a simple game,
but it's very well executed.

00:31:15.169 --> 00:31:20.820
So the idea with Patentia is that you're going
to--

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:23.220
&gt;&gt;Galpin: You can even switch-- There we are,
yeah, exactly.

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:26.850
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: You're going to go ahead and draw
a shape.

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:28.980
These are mostly-- They start out as Tetris
shapes--

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:31.669
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Most of them are tetrominos.

00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:34.230
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: But you can draw them in any orientation.

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:39.399
Which honestly was the one thing I didn't
like, because it meant I had to do a lot of

00:31:39.399 --> 00:31:41.559
drawing, and sometimes I'd get it wrong.

00:31:41.559 --> 00:31:45.570
But as an interface, there's a couple things
that are really good about it.

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:47.139
First, it's very reactive.

00:31:47.139 --> 00:31:51.960
It's got this particle system which means
absolutely nothing, but it's kinda cool.

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.080
And it shows you where you're drawing.

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:57.020
It's just really, really good at that.

00:31:57.020 --> 00:32:03.320
And then, what's clever about it is you're
trying to fill space so no matter what shape

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:07.639
things are, the idea is you need to put them
together so that you can get these things

00:32:07.639 --> 00:32:08.639
through.

00:32:08.639 --> 00:32:09.639
And if you wait for these--

00:32:09.639 --> 00:32:10.870
&gt;&gt;Galpin: You're trying to create rectangles
or squares.

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:11.870
That's your goal.

00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:12.870
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:18.289
And you're trying to fill the entirety of
the board.

00:32:18.289 --> 00:32:27.259
And if you can make it a square, for instance,
like this, well, almost like that-- Let's

00:32:27.259 --> 00:32:31.700
see, I think I-- All right, I'm going to need
a new shape there.

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:35.100
[pause] [clicking sounds] Darn it.

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:42.499
See, this is where I would love to have better
[pause] intelligence of some kind.

00:32:42.499 --> 00:32:45.999
Why am I-- Everything I draw doesn't work.

00:32:45.999 --> 00:32:49.519
Okay, there we go.

00:32:49.519 --> 00:32:50.519
All right.

00:32:50.519 --> 00:32:51.519
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah.

00:32:51.519 --> 00:32:52.519
It's--

00:32:52.519 --> 00:32:53.519
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Help me out here, man.

00:32:53.519 --> 00:32:54.519
&gt;&gt;Galpin: You have to think about that block.

00:32:54.519 --> 00:32:56.159
You can only draw it in the four rotated orientations
of that block.

00:32:56.159 --> 00:32:57.159
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:32:57.159 --> 00:33:00.570
&gt;&gt;Galpin: So you can't-- Unfortunately, it's
a little-- You do have to think back to the

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:05.210
block and it's physical shape rather than
just it's-- You can't draw its flipped orientation,

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:06.210
basically.

00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:07.210
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Right, exactly.

00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:13.159
You have to just draw it rotated, and so for
me, because I'm handicapped that way, it was

00:33:13.159 --> 00:33:14.539
a little more difficult.

00:33:14.539 --> 00:33:18.950
Which is weird, because I did so well on the
ASVAB spatial rotation stuff.

00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:21.970
I don't know, maybe it's just-- Anyway--

00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:24.229
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I blame the alcohol right now.

00:33:24.229 --> 00:33:25.229
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Right, there you go.

00:33:25.229 --> 00:33:29.489
Now, I'm going to-- See, that made me a huge
rectangle.

00:33:29.489 --> 00:33:33.369
And one thing that's kinda cool about this
is that while that rectangle's building, I

00:33:33.369 --> 00:33:34.509
can actually make it bigger.

00:33:34.509 --> 00:33:37.190
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, that is really cool.

00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:41.740
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: I don't know if that actually
helps anything, but I can do it.

00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:45.230
And then as long as I wait for it to fill
up, it gives me more score.

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:48.600
Now, that doesn't seem like a big deal on
a level like this, but in a level where you

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:53.249
have very little space, and very little time,
that's kinda a big deal.

00:33:53.249 --> 00:33:58.960
Do you wait for it to fill up, or do you tap
it immediately to get less score but more

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:01.399
space?

00:34:01.399 --> 00:34:04.919
As you go on, the levels get more and more
difficult.

00:34:04.919 --> 00:34:10.580
And you start moving from these tetrominos
to more and more weird and interesting shapes.

00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:17.169
Some of them are quite frustrating, and very
large gameboard.

00:34:17.169 --> 00:34:22.490
So actually, I think I have to admit, after
several hours of play, I think I ended up

00:34:22.490 --> 00:34:27.029
crapping out on level four or five, which
is was just gigantic.

00:34:27.029 --> 00:34:30.230
It was almost impossible to fill in the time
they gave you.

00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:31.230
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Let's see.

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:36.800
I thought I-- I know I was drawing that correctly,
so it just didn't register my draw.

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:37.800
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:42.069
The other thing that's interesting is that
you'll notice that some of these little blocks

00:34:42.069 --> 00:34:44.039
have cracks in them.

00:34:44.039 --> 00:34:50.030
And that becomes important later on because
those will get removed if you don't have space.

00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:51.190
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Ohhhh, nice.

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:57.200
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Those are what they call "leftovers",
which are just-- Once you've drawn something,

00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:03.480
if part of the shape forms a rectangle, and
the rest of them don't, like these two right

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:04.480
here--

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:05.480
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Gotcha.

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:08.099
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Those are now going to turn into
leftovers.

00:35:08.099 --> 00:35:11.180
And if you run out of space, those will get
removed.

00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:18.119
And if that happens, you'll get more space,
but your score multiplier will get reset.

00:35:18.119 --> 00:35:22.260
Right now, you're at a score multiplier of
two.

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:24.000
And it would get reset back to one.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.099
&gt;&gt;Galpin: "Next board unlocked."

00:35:25.099 --> 00:35:29.839
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Right, and that's because you
covered 50% of the board or more.

00:35:29.839 --> 00:35:30.839
So you can tell this--

00:35:30.839 --> 00:35:32.310
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I thought this game was totally
clear.

00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:33.990
We're both-- You know.

00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:38.440
I would like to see them get rid of the compatibility
button in the zoom and the zoom thing and

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:39.440
target--

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:43.290
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: If you look down at the bottom
of the screen, you can see a lot of things

00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:45.579
going wrong that shouldn't be going wrong.

00:35:45.579 --> 00:35:51.640
But overall-- And of course, on this Asus
Transformer Prime, the UI up in the upper

00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:54.450
left-hand corner is much smaller than it needs
to be.

00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:57.270
It's verging on not being readable.

00:35:57.270 --> 00:36:02.200
You also do need a pretty hefty manual.

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:06.490
I had to reread the instructions several times
before I understood what was going on.

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:10.840
And I would say that a more professional game
would have introduced all of the concepts

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:16.072
to me via tutorials rather than just throwing
me into the--

00:36:16.072 --> 00:36:19.829
&gt;&gt;Galpin: The only reason I know what I was
doing was that I watched the video.

00:36:19.829 --> 00:36:21.420
And that was super, super helpful.

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:22.420
But I agree.

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:23.420
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: See, that's the thing.

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:24.420
I never watch videos.

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:25.420
Why?

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:26.420
Because they're a complete waste of time.

00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:27.420
Why would anyone watch a video?

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:28.420
[laughs] All right!

00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:29.420
&gt;&gt;Galpin: So.

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:30.570
This is low on battery.

00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:32.620
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: We'd better get to the end.

00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:34.369
Fortunately, we're almost to the next game.

00:36:34.369 --> 00:36:35.369
Okay.

00:36:35.369 --> 00:36:37.160
&gt;&gt;Galpin: We didn't bring the charger.

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:38.250
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:40.720
Yeah, Patentia-- Oh, look at that.

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:45.500
Patentia had good [pause] feature graphic.

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:50.710
"Block dropping puzzle game reinvention for
touchscreen" will not be legible if Patentia

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:52.430
is featured on a phone.

00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:54.640
So that's one thing that you want to look
out for.

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:55.990
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Also, that icon, really?

00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:58.620
Do we really need a rounded rectangle for
that?

00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:00.740
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: No, you don't at all, actually.

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:01.740
No.

00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:04.309
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I love to see you come up with some
other theme, other than--

00:37:04.309 --> 00:37:09.319
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Well, at least it's not as bad
as the Offroad Legends icon, which has chrome

00:37:09.319 --> 00:37:10.400
around it.

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:13.950
Although, since it's about monster trucks,
I'll allow the chrome.

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:14.950
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah.

00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:19.109
And actually, I like the fact that the dust
actually covers up the chrome as if it were

00:37:19.109 --> 00:37:20.109
real.

00:37:20.109 --> 00:37:21.109
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: That is cool.

00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:22.109
It should pop out, right.

00:37:22.109 --> 00:37:23.109
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Oh, yeah.

00:37:23.109 --> 00:37:24.109
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:37:24.109 --> 00:37:28.450
These guys-- Now, the Offroad Legends icon
there, or the title, should be larger for

00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:29.820
a feature graphic.

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:33.270
We usually recommend that it covers about
50% of the available pixels.

00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:35.119
So it should be twice as big.

00:37:35.119 --> 00:37:37.730
&gt;&gt;Galpin: It's got to be at least a third
the height of it.

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:42.910
If it's smaller than a third the height of
it, we say it's going to be illegible.

00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:48.750
I would say if it were a good 25% bigger,
it would be the minimum acceptable size there.

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:51.450
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: This is Offroad Legend by Dog
bite games.

00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:55.789
I mean, how much more masculine can you get?

00:37:55.789 --> 00:37:57.059
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Exactly, exactly.

00:37:57.059 --> 00:37:58.660
Actually, I really like their other game.

00:37:58.660 --> 00:37:59.660
It's 8 bit Ninja.

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:00.660
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: [laughs]

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:02.850
&gt;&gt;Galpin: It made my kinda laugh as I was
looking.

00:38:02.850 --> 00:38:03.850
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: It's very awesome.

00:38:03.850 --> 00:38:05.510
&gt;&gt;Galpin: This is a fairly radically different
kind of game.

00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:06.510
We'll actually bring it up.

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:09.210
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah, let's take a look at this.

00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:11.349
Offroad Legends' is a very polished game.

00:38:11.349 --> 00:38:14.119
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Let's bring up a scoreloop and say,
"Hello!

00:38:14.119 --> 00:38:15.309
Do you like fun?"

00:38:15.309 --> 00:38:18.049
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: No, scoreloop doesn't ask if you
like fun.

00:38:18.049 --> 00:38:20.391
&gt;&gt;Galpin: No, I know it doesn't.

00:38:20.391 --> 00:38:21.391
Oh, no, no, it's bringing up Tapjoy ads.

00:38:21.391 --> 00:38:22.391
All right.

00:38:22.391 --> 00:38:23.391
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Really?

00:38:23.391 --> 00:38:24.391
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah.

00:38:24.391 --> 00:38:25.391
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Oh.

00:38:25.391 --> 00:38:26.391
I didn't get hit with that.

00:38:26.391 --> 00:38:27.391
Maybe my--

00:38:27.391 --> 00:38:28.391
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Oooh, I do like that.

00:38:28.391 --> 00:38:29.391
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: What?

00:38:29.391 --> 00:38:30.391
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Is that not the awesome--

00:38:30.391 --> 00:38:31.391
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: That is pretty sweet.

00:38:31.391 --> 00:38:32.391
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I know.

00:38:32.391 --> 00:38:33.391
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: It's not exactly a monster truck,
though.

00:38:33.391 --> 00:38:34.391
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I know.

00:38:34.391 --> 00:38:35.391
There we are.

00:38:35.391 --> 00:38:37.140
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: You've got quite an accomplished
garage, my friend.

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:39.980
&gt;&gt;Galpin: No, that's 'cause I pretend to go
and review the game.

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:42.340
You get that if you hit the--

00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:45.390
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: They gave you an incentive for
reviewing the game?

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:46.390
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah!

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:47.480
They didn't actually say what kind of--

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:48.650
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: [exhales] Get a room.

00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:50.380
&gt;&gt;Galpin: They didn't say what kind of review
to give.

00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:51.839
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Oh, that's a good point.

00:38:51.839 --> 00:38:55.170
&gt;&gt;Galpin: They just said, "Review the game
and get this."

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:58.020
I'm like, "Cool," so I clicked the button
and then I went back.

00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:00.250
And I got this, which is kinda awesome.

00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:03.559
[rustling and scraping sounds] Okay.

00:39:03.559 --> 00:39:05.609
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Go ahead.

00:39:05.609 --> 00:39:08.940
[more rustling and scraping]

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:09.940
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Okay.

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:15.369
Now the bummer is that I can't actually choose
that bus for the monster warm-up.

00:39:15.369 --> 00:39:16.369
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Oh, that sucks!

00:39:16.369 --> 00:39:18.710
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I know, I know.

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:25.690
But this game has got pretty good visuals.

00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:32.780
For the style of game it is, which is kinda
this web style of track--

00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:34.650
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah, it's like a four button--
Basically.

00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:41.540
&gt;&gt;Meier: I have to ask: are the wheels on
the truck filled with helium, 'cause I'm not

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:43.280
sure that those physics are legit.

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:44.609
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I don't think this game--

00:39:44.609 --> 00:39:48.190
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: That's because you don't live
in America, my friend.

00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:49.470
&gt;&gt;Meier: [laughs]

00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:51.380
&gt;&gt;Galpin: [laughs] Whoohoo!

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:53.299
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: You'll learn.

00:39:53.299 --> 00:39:54.579
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah.

00:39:54.579 --> 00:39:56.780
Monster-- This has monster truck physics.

00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:57.780
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:59.260
&gt;&gt;Galpin: It's the kind of physics we invented
here.

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:02.300
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Monster trucks are completely
different from other trucks.

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:03.480
They're monstrous.

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:04.480
The thing--

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:06.069
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Oh yeah, there we are.

00:40:06.069 --> 00:40:10.442
You have to have gratuitous and unnecessary
pictures of people who look like Danica Patrick

00:40:10.442 --> 00:40:11.570
in your game.

00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:13.109
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: That's right.

00:40:13.109 --> 00:40:14.109
Americaaaaa!

00:40:14.109 --> 00:40:16.609
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I'm thinking Go Daddy right now.

00:40:16.609 --> 00:40:17.619
I don't know why.

00:40:17.619 --> 00:40:18.619
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Right?

00:40:18.619 --> 00:40:22.569
I'm thinking that half of the racing games
in the world, honestly.

00:40:22.569 --> 00:40:28.119
But I'll tell you what sets this apart is
not only do they have a fairly good set of--

00:40:28.119 --> 00:40:29.619
not perfect.

00:40:29.619 --> 00:40:31.140
The presentation is not perfect.

00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:34.079
There is a few cheesy icons--

00:40:34.079 --> 00:40:35.480
&gt;&gt;Galpin: It's a little busy at times.

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:37.890
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: --and some gradients that look
really, really out of place.

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:42.970
But in general, especially in the game, it
looks great.

00:40:42.970 --> 00:40:48.059
And unlike many of the racing games we've
reviewed, they have some great crash physics.

00:40:48.059 --> 00:40:50.160
&gt;&gt;Galpin: They really, really do.

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:51.160
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:52.309
Yeah, give us a crash.

00:40:52.309 --> 00:40:53.530
Give us a crash.

00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:54.530
Crash for daddy.

00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:55.530
Boom!

00:40:55.530 --> 00:40:56.530
No, that's not a crash.

00:40:56.530 --> 00:40:57.530
&gt;&gt;Galpin: That was a bad crash.

00:40:57.530 --> 00:40:59.450
Well, this is a good one.

00:40:59.450 --> 00:41:01.200
There we are.

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:02.200
Boom!

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:03.200
Oh, there we are!

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:04.200
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Ah, there you go!

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.200
Yeah!

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:06.200
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, that's a good one.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:07.200
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:08.200
Yeah, I don't know-- The truck is a little
better, I think, than the car.

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:09.700
I think they have a better crash model.

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:11.359
&gt;&gt;Galpin: They do, they do.

00:41:11.359 --> 00:41:12.360
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: But yeah.

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:14.690
Now, they do have some weird physics.

00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:18.430
And it is actually possible to lose a wheel
without ending the race.

00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:19.680
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Oh, wow, that's cool.

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:26.049
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: I know this because last night,
I lost three wheels and was unable to do anything.

00:41:26.049 --> 00:41:27.599
But the race was still on.

00:41:27.599 --> 00:41:28.859
You know why?

00:41:28.859 --> 00:41:29.960
[pause] America.

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:31.060
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Absolutely.

00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:33.260
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: [laughs] So-- Whoa!

00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:34.910
That is awesome.

00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:39.980
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I think that's actually the first
time you've ever sworn on the program.

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:40.980
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: What?

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:42.450
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I think, I think.

00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:43.530
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: What?

00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:45.150
Did I swear?

00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:48.079
&gt;&gt;Galpin: [laughs] I know, I know.

00:41:48.079 --> 00:41:49.079
Shocking.

00:41:49.079 --> 00:41:50.130
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: I totally--

00:41:50.130 --> 00:41:52.619
&gt;&gt;Galpin: You sang the song from--

00:41:52.619 --> 00:41:53.779
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: No I didn't!

00:41:53.779 --> 00:41:54.779
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Okay.

00:41:54.779 --> 00:41:56.480
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: No, that happened inside your
head.

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:57.950
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Oh, okay, okay, it might have.

00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:58.950
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Weird.

00:41:58.950 --> 00:41:59.950
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Ooooh, there we are.

00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:00.950
Finally I get to use my bus.

00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:01.950
Yaaaaay!

00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:02.950
&gt;&gt;Lucas: I think there's auto complete profanity.

00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:03.950
[laughs]

00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:04.950
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: That's possible.

00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:09.710
&gt;&gt;Lucas: He talks and we just fill in the
f-bombs.

00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:14.779
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Whoohoo! [pause] So yeah.

00:42:14.779 --> 00:42:17.950
I don't know what else to say on this game.

00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:23.010
I believe this game also plays audio on the
lock screen, as I recall.

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:26.780
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: [laughs] I'm going to give it
a pass.

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:27.839
&gt;&gt;Lucas: [laughs]

00:42:27.839 --> 00:42:30.510
&gt;&gt;Meier: Would that be because "America"?

00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:31.510
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Exactly!

00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:32.900
Because of America, that's why!

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:33.900
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Oooh, man.

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:35.270
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah, check that out!

00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:37.200
See, the race is still on.

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:38.620
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Dude, there's nothing I can do.

00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:41.150
Can I put the tires back on? [all laugh]

00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:43.319
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: I don't know, maybe that's an
in-app purchase.

00:42:43.319 --> 00:42:44.319
&gt;&gt;Lucas: [laughs]

00:42:44.319 --> 00:42:45.319
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: It totally should be.

00:42:45.319 --> 00:42:46.319
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Gaaah!

00:42:46.319 --> 00:42:48.410
How do I manipulate my car anymore?

00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:50.750
&gt;&gt;Meier: Can you in-app purchase an RAC membership
for that service?

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:52.800
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I guess I can.

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:55.740
Wow, this is pretty sad.

00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:57.230
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: [laughs] Nice.

00:42:57.230 --> 00:43:00.710
&gt;&gt;Galpin: All right, all right, all right.

00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:01.710
Restart.

00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:04.280
It looks like we're going to run out of battery
just at the right time here.

00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:06.770
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Oh, we're already overtime.

00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:08.140
But this was a great game.

00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:09.970
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, it's totally fine.

00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:11.122
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: It's not everybody's cup of tea.

00:43:11.122 --> 00:43:13.960
It's honestly, all joking aside, probably
not my cup of tea.

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:16.250
There's a few things that I would love to
change about it.

00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:17.710
I feel like the--

00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:18.710
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Ahhh!

00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:20.779
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: --the difficulty is just wrong.

00:43:20.779 --> 00:43:26.740
It's not easy enough to get big air, yet it's
too easy to land small jumps.

00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:29.330
There's not a lot of skill involved.

00:43:29.330 --> 00:43:36.770
And maybe it's just me, because I live in
the Bay Area and for all my bragging, I know

00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:40.140
nothing about monster truck physics, but--
Nice!

00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:43.430
Okay, now, see, that's the thing!

00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:47.589
Right there, I'll tell you what really needs
to happen: you need an achievement.

00:43:47.589 --> 00:43:50.150
You need something that pops up and says,
"Pancake!"

00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:51.319
&gt;&gt;Galpin: That's so true.

00:43:51.319 --> 00:43:52.319
&gt;&gt;Meier: [laughs]

00:43:52.319 --> 00:43:53.940
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, 'cause that actually-- that
takes--

00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:55.440
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: You know what?

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:58.829
Everything that I was saying that was critical,
I take it all back.

00:43:58.829 --> 00:44:00.349
'Cause that was awesome.

00:44:00.349 --> 00:44:02.190
That was so awesome.

00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:04.049
All right, you know what?

00:44:04.049 --> 00:44:05.130
Let's go ahead and--

00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:09.330
&gt;&gt;Galpin: We're never going-- I can already
tell that Ian's never going driving with me

00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:10.330
again.

00:44:10.330 --> 00:44:12.849
This is-- I have demonstrated--

00:44:12.849 --> 00:44:13.849
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: I never drive with you.

00:44:13.849 --> 00:44:14.849
You drive a Prius.

00:44:14.849 --> 00:44:15.849
&gt;&gt;Galpin: That's true, actually.

00:44:15.849 --> 00:44:16.849
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: [laughs] All right.

00:44:16.849 --> 00:44:19.260
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Never again are we doing monster
trucks together.

00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:21.180
&gt;&gt;Lucas: Is it an offroading Prius?

00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:22.180
&gt;&gt;Galpin: That's true.

00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:26.680
That would be kinda awesome, to get the jacked
up Prius.

00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:29.079
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: How would you know the difference?

00:44:29.079 --> 00:44:30.079
&gt;&gt;Galpin: The diff-- Whoohoo!

00:44:30.079 --> 00:44:31.079
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Oh yeah, you could.

00:44:31.079 --> 00:44:32.079
&gt;&gt;Lucas: Spray-on mud.

00:44:32.079 --> 00:44:33.079
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Nice.

00:44:33.079 --> 00:44:34.079
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Whoa!

00:44:34.079 --> 00:44:35.079
There we are!

00:44:35.079 --> 00:44:36.079
All right!

00:44:36.079 --> 00:44:37.079
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Boom! [music playing] That's it!

00:44:37.079 --> 00:44:38.079
All right.

00:44:38.079 --> 00:44:39.079
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Just after I made it through the
jump.

00:44:39.079 --> 00:44:40.079
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Oh, oh, oh!

00:44:40.079 --> 00:44:41.079
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Oh, nice.

00:44:41.079 --> 00:44:42.079
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Oh, yeah, I forgot.

00:44:42.079 --> 00:44:43.079
I did this for Dan.

00:44:43.079 --> 00:44:44.079
Watch.

00:44:44.079 --> 00:44:45.079
We're done!

00:44:45.079 --> 00:44:46.079
Brrrr [makes exploding noise]

00:44:46.079 --> 00:44:47.079
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Oh man, flame effects.

00:44:47.079 --> 00:44:48.079
That's awesome.

00:44:48.079 --> 00:44:49.079
And that worked so well after Offroad.

00:44:49.079 --> 00:44:50.079
That was cool.

00:44:50.079 --> 00:44:51.079
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Right?

00:44:51.079 --> 00:44:52.079
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah.

00:44:52.079 --> 00:44:53.819
Well definitely, I can't wait to see what
you do with aftereffects now.

00:44:53.819 --> 00:44:54.819
We could--

00:44:54.819 --> 00:44:55.819
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: I know, right?

00:44:55.819 --> 00:44:56.819
It's going to be incredible.

00:44:56.819 --> 00:44:57.819
All right.

00:44:57.819 --> 00:45:00.350
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Wait, wait, wait, look.

00:45:00.350 --> 00:45:01.859
Check this out.

00:45:01.859 --> 00:45:02.859
What happened?

00:45:02.859 --> 00:45:04.890
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: I poured myself a second glass.

00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:05.890
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Oh, okay.

00:45:05.890 --> 00:45:07.190
I was going to say!

00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:08.920
&gt;&gt;Lucas: And he poured me zero.

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:11.619
&gt;&gt;Galpin: You've not given Alex any beer yet?

00:45:11.619 --> 00:45:12.619
[scoffs]

00:45:12.619 --> 00:45:14.609
&gt;&gt;Lucas: I'm going to be sober.

00:45:14.609 --> 00:45:15.609
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Wow.

00:45:15.609 --> 00:45:16.609
&gt;&gt;Lucas: Hurts.

00:45:16.609 --> 00:45:18.010
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, I know.

00:45:18.010 --> 00:45:19.480
&gt;&gt;Lucas: This is why I've been randomly muting
you throughout the show.

00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:20.480
&gt;&gt;Galpin: [laughs]

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:24.280
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Makes sense-- did-- So Alex, producer
Alex, how did the YouTube comment stream go?

00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:25.500
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yes.

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:30.430
&gt;&gt;Lucas: Actually, we have, from the developer
of Pearls, who's also invited the developer

00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:33.579
of Vision of the Veggies, which we reviewed
a couple months ago.

00:45:33.579 --> 00:45:34.579
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:45:34.579 --> 00:45:35.579
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Oh!

00:45:35.579 --> 00:45:38.920
&gt;&gt;Lucas: He says he updated the feature graphic,
and it should be up soon.

00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:39.920
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Awesome!

00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:40.920
&gt;&gt;Lucas: And he'd like to get our feedback.

00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:42.940
It doesn't look like it's refreshed yet, but
as far as developers and apps we've reviewed

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:46.130
on this show, he's by far the fastest turnaround
load, the fastest feedback loop.

00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:47.130
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah, yeah.

00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:48.130
Rock on.

00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:53.440
&gt;&gt;Lucas: While we-- This is the second time
while we comment on the thing.

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:56.289
He says, "Hey, I can fix that."

00:45:56.289 --> 00:45:57.289
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Nice.

00:45:57.289 --> 00:45:59.569
Well, I think it's a good game.

00:45:59.569 --> 00:46:00.569
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, it is.

00:46:00.569 --> 00:46:02.071
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: And it's one of those games that's--

00:46:02.071 --> 00:46:03.071
&gt;&gt;Galpin: It's hard, actually.

00:46:03.071 --> 00:46:04.071
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:46:04.071 --> 00:46:06.579
It's fun to pick and-- Well actually, that's
a good point.

00:46:06.579 --> 00:46:13.859
Actually, if you're still listening: bubble
popping games are incredibly popular, and

00:46:13.859 --> 00:46:17.520
they are-- Hey Reto, you can switch to me
anytime you want.

00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:19.049
&gt;&gt;Lucas: I'm the prettier one.

00:46:19.049 --> 00:46:21.910
&gt;&gt;Galpin: I actually kinda like it on Alex.

00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:23.520
&gt;&gt;Meier: You get some of the best [inaudible].

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:24.520
&gt;&gt;Lucas: [laughs]

00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:27.490
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, in fact, we're totally scoring
points with our Greek audience now.

00:46:27.490 --> 00:46:28.490
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Gotcha.

00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:29.490
Anyway.

00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:35.569
What I was trying to say is, if you're still
listening: the bubble popping game audience

00:46:35.569 --> 00:46:42.670
skews older, female, and is almost certainly
not an audience that's looking for a really

00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:44.440
high stress game.

00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:48.510
Also, I play them a lot, despite not being
female.

00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:51.120
Or [pause] anyway.

00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:52.120
The point is--

00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:53.120
&gt;&gt;Galpin: You use it to de-stress.

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:54.120
It's my moment of Zen.

00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:58.050
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: The point is that you do need
to make sure you've got a learning curve on

00:46:58.050 --> 00:47:01.109
these things that isn't going to completely
frustrate your audience.

00:47:01.109 --> 00:47:05.799
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, I would say that was my one
comment about the game, was I wanted there

00:47:05.799 --> 00:47:07.039
to be an "ease you in" moment.

00:47:07.039 --> 00:47:12.950
And because of the design of the puzzles,
it is actually tricky to do that.

00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:15.049
But I think it's possible.

00:47:15.049 --> 00:47:20.279
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Well, the other thing that I would
suggest that I think would improve the game

00:47:20.279 --> 00:47:26.299
is it did take me a few times before I understood
what the rules were of drawing the line through

00:47:26.299 --> 00:47:27.880
the pearls.

00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:31.060
And the game does a pretty good job of it.

00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:32.060
&gt;&gt;Galpin: It does, actually.

00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:33.180
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: It's not bad.

00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:37.550
But I think it could really be improved with
a few examples where you actually just draw

00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:39.400
the line for the user.

00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:41.650
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, definitely, definitely.

00:47:41.650 --> 00:47:43.339
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: All right.

00:47:43.339 --> 00:47:45.450
Anything else on the YouTube there, Alex?

00:47:45.450 --> 00:47:46.450
Producer Alex?

00:47:46.450 --> 00:47:47.660
Executive Producer Alex?

00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:49.480
&gt;&gt;Lucas: All's quiet on the YouTube front.

00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:50.480
&gt;&gt;Galpin: All right.

00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:54.329
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Well, you guys suck. [laughs]
All right.

00:47:54.329 --> 00:47:55.540
So that's our show for today.

00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:56.540
&gt;&gt;Galpin: We abuse our audience.

00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:58.400
That's what we do here on the Friday Game
Review.

00:47:58.400 --> 00:47:59.400
&gt;&gt;Lucas: Oh actually--

00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:00.400
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: That's exactly what we do.

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:02.960
&gt;&gt;Lucas: Igor says, "I think I'll be getting
hammered tonight.

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:03.960
Sorry, not me.

00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:04.960
I was thinking of Ian.

00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:05.960
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah!

00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:06.960
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Oooh, yeah!

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:07.960
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: All right.

00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:11.119
Who's got two thumbs and needs to go to AA?

00:48:11.119 --> 00:48:12.119
&gt;&gt;Galpin: [squeaks]

00:48:12.119 --> 00:48:13.150
&gt;&gt;Lucas: That guy.

00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:14.680
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: No. [laughs] All right.

00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:17.240
Actually, I've been babysitting my baby daughter
all week.

00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:18.640
My wife is out of town.

00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:20.570
She's in Shanghai on business.

00:48:20.570 --> 00:48:24.690
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Hopefully she's bringing you some
cool stuff back for the household?

00:48:24.690 --> 00:48:25.690
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Well, I hope so.

00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:27.630
I could use some more of those ceramic knives,
I'll tell you that much.

00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:29.069
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, those ceramic knives were
kickass.

00:48:29.069 --> 00:48:30.069
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Weren't they good?

00:48:30.069 --> 00:48:31.069
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah, really good.

00:48:31.069 --> 00:48:32.069
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: All right.

00:48:32.069 --> 00:48:33.069
&gt;&gt;Galpin: It's a pack for me.

00:48:33.069 --> 00:48:34.069
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: [laughs] All right.

00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:35.069
Well, that is our show.

00:48:35.069 --> 00:48:37.849
Thanks very much for joining us on the Friday
Games Review.

00:48:37.849 --> 00:48:41.250
We will be back next week with another open
topic.

00:48:41.250 --> 00:48:42.250
We'll see how this goes.

00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:43.250
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah.

00:48:43.250 --> 00:48:46.289
There was a lot of other stuff in the topic
from this week, too.

00:48:46.289 --> 00:48:47.289
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:48:47.289 --> 00:48:52.130
Just remember that, unlike before, we are
refreshing the topic each week.

00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:56.910
So if you nominate something this week and
it didn't get chosen, you do need to renominate

00:48:56.910 --> 00:49:00.350
it for next week in order for it to be considered
again.

00:49:00.350 --> 00:49:01.599
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Absolutely.

00:49:01.599 --> 00:49:04.700
And we'll probably at some point have some
themes as well, again.

00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:11.480
I think the current thought is that we'll
actually always take some random games, so

00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:16.750
we don't have to have someone who waits for
six months 'til we get back to the theme again.

00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:19.299
Because a lot of people want us to look at
their games.

00:49:19.299 --> 00:49:23.520
But also, we do really, really like the idea
of being able to theme some of the shows.

00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:26.400
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: We've also talked about a few
other options.

00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:28.230
I'd love to get some feedback from our viewers.

00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:29.230
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Absolutely.

00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:33.230
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: For instance, we've discussed
the possibility of talking about the games

00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:36.970
that are going to be featured that week, and
why they were featured, and what they have

00:49:36.970 --> 00:49:37.970
in common.

00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:38.970
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Exactly.

00:49:38.970 --> 00:49:43.400
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: We've talked about maybe looking
at games from unknown developers, or maybe

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:47.589
even previewing games from known developers
that you might be excited about.

00:49:47.589 --> 00:49:48.799
Let us know what you're interested in.

00:49:48.799 --> 00:49:52.450
We'd love to make this show more valuable
to you.

00:49:52.450 --> 00:49:54.099
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah.

00:49:54.099 --> 00:49:59.490
What I really want, actually, at some point,
is to do a show where people nominate games

00:49:59.490 --> 00:50:00.630
that they wish were better.

00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:02.690
Wouldn't that be kinda cool?

00:50:02.690 --> 00:50:05.390
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: That would be an excellent-- And
that's one thing that we have talked about

00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:06.990
doing: maybe a game clinic.

00:50:06.990 --> 00:50:09.369
'Cause we have plenty of tools here.

00:50:09.369 --> 00:50:14.099
We look at games in very in depth ways all
the time, trying to figure out how their draw

00:50:14.099 --> 00:50:18.530
order and their texturing and their resources
and their geometry affects their performance.

00:50:18.530 --> 00:50:21.109
&gt;&gt;Galpin: How can we make this game suck less?

00:50:21.109 --> 00:50:22.109
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:50:22.109 --> 00:50:23.109
&gt;&gt;Galpin: We do that all the time.

00:50:23.109 --> 00:50:24.869
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: We would love to switch into that
mode, I think.

00:50:24.869 --> 00:50:25.869
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Absolutely.

00:50:25.869 --> 00:50:27.359
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Let us know what you think.

00:50:27.359 --> 00:50:30.710
And to all our drunk friends in Austria: "Hey."

00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:34.869
And-- Cool, do you want to do mirror?

00:50:34.869 --> 00:50:35.910
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Yeah!

00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:37.470
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: All right.

00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:40.640
Anyway, it's been good chatting with you on
the Friday Game Review.

00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:43.059
And we will see you next week at our new time.

00:50:43.059 --> 00:50:44.059
Right?

00:50:44.059 --> 00:50:45.400
We have a new time?

00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:48.130
&gt;&gt;Galpin: Do we have a new time?

00:50:48.130 --> 00:50:49.130
Sure.

00:50:49.130 --> 00:50:50.130
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Next week.

00:50:50.130 --> 00:50:53.809
Make sure you check our Google+ page, because
there may be a new time.

00:50:53.809 --> 00:50:54.809
&gt;&gt;Galpin: May be a new time.

00:50:54.809 --> 00:50:57.930
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: And if there is, you do not want
to miss that.

00:50:57.930 --> 00:50:58.930
&gt;&gt;Galpin: That's right.

00:50:58.930 --> 00:51:00.050
All right, thanks everyone.

00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:01.050
&gt;&gt;Ni-Lewis: Take care.
