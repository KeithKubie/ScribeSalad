00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.110
Hi, I'm Jason from the
Google Sign-in team.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.540
I'm going to talk with you
about helping more Google users

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.600
sign into your app or website.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.380
Connecting with your
users is important to you.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.020
It's how you build a stronger,
more meaningful, and sometimes

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.990
more profitable
relationship with them.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.040
But some users may not
be willing to jump right

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.142
into a deep, committed
relationship.

00:00:19.142 --> 00:00:20.600
Asking for this
level of commitment

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.380
too early can turn
users off and make

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.580
them think of connecting to your
app as cheap and unimportant.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.090
People naturally build trust
in a relationship over time.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.590
That's why we're
excited to tell you

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.800
about incremental authorization.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.900
With incremental auth,
you can let your users

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.120
connect with your app,
see what you're all about,

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.770
then decide to deepen
that relationship.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.830
When you ask a user to authorize
your app to access data

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.320
during sign-in, she is
presented with a screen that

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.540
describes the data your
app is trying to access.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.740
It's up to you as the developer
to put yourself in her shoes.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.220
Ask yourself, will
she understand

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.299
why I'm asking for a
certain permission?

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:55.840
Are there so many
permissions that it

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.420
seems scary to sign into my app?

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.810
If she clicks through without
reading or understanding

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.990
exactly how a
permission works, how

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.830
will she feel later
if she finds out

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.810
she granted me this permission?

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.820
All of these answers
may affect the trust

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.150
that your current and future
users feel towards your app.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.660
If your answers point to
showing fewer permissions,

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.530
you need something that will
simplify signing into your app.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.890
To do this, you can
use incremental auth.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.210
With incremental auth,
you can ask your user

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.150
to give just a basic
set of permissions

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.750
that are easy to accept,
like accessing her profile

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:27.860
information.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.920
Profile information includes
her Google user ID, full name,

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.310
and profile image.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.150
With just this basic connection,
you now have a way for her

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.480
to connect with your app
across different platforms

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.760
with just a single tap or click.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.610
You can also personalize
her experience

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.620
by showing her profile image
and name inside your app.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.940
Your app may also have great
collaboration or sharing

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:48.940
features.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.750
After using it for
a while, your user

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.310
may find it useful to sign
into more Google services

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.320
within your app.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.610
For example, if your app
allows him to create images,

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.320
he may want to upload them to
his Google Drive or share them

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.163
on Google+.

00:02:01.163 --> 00:02:04.590
Incremental auth enables you to
ask him for these permissions

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.900
at exactly the right
time, when he has already

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.960
expressed interest by
interacting with a saving

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.840
or sharing feature in your app.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.550
By providing the proper
context for the decision,

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.340
your user already
knows he's ready to use

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.060
more features of your app, to
be more involved in your app's

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.225
community, and to tell his
friends to come join him

00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:23.600
in that community.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.560
Letting your user understand why
you're asking for authorization

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.350
before asking for it can
dramatically increase

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.360
sign-in conversions, leading
to more users with a deeper

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.780
involvement in your app.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.700
It's that simple.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.640
You can use Google Sign-in
today to connect any Google

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.600
user to your app or website.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.630
If you offer an option
to connect with Google+,

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.370
we make sure they have a Google+
account set up before your app

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.300
uses Google+ features.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.410
But feel free to use any Google
API such as YouTube or Drive.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.860
Consult the documentation
for the specific API

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.360
to decide which
permissions you need

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.990
to ask for before
calling the API.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.400
And remember, it may be best
to ask for permissions one

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.470
at a time or to ask
for a few at a time.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.680
The list just needs to
make sense to the user,

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.640
so they can feel
confident granting

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.850
your app the access it needs.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.440
By using incremental auth
and building a relationship

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.350
with your user
over time, you can

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.670
build a long-term, harmonious
relationship with them.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.430
I'm Jason from the
Google Sign-in team,

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.304
and you just learned
how incremental auth can

00:03:22.304 --> 00:03:24.840
help you to grow your
signed-in Google users.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.590
For more information
on how to get started

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.131
with incremental auth, check
out these pages on our developer

00:03:29.131 --> 00:03:31.750
site and get ready
to grow with Google.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.590
Thanks for watching.
