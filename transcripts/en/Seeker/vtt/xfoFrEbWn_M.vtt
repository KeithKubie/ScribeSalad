00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.240
Diamonds come with a lot cultural implications
because, in part, they're rare!

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.500
But what if you could just make some?

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:15.969
Hey there my precious little gemstones, Trace
with ya on DNews today.

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.640
Geologists are still figuring out the exact
details, but we know nature’s recipe for

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.300
diamonds is carbon, heat, and pressure.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.720
Naturally-formed diamonds start with carbon
dioxide buried some 100 miles deep in the

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.820
Earth’s mantle.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.760
At those depths, there’s incredible heat
and pressure from the rock above, which is

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.760
good!

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.870
The heat of about 2,200 degrees Fahrenheit
and the pressure of 725,000 pounds per square

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.920
inch
causes the carbon to crystallize, forming

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:43.920
a diamond.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.219
And with each carbon atom bonded to four others,
it’s one of the hardest materials on Earth.

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.039
The diamond is then punted up to the surface
hitching a ride on lava flows.

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.909
And because they’re coming from deep in
the Earth, diamonds are really old!

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:01.480
This process happened anywhere from hundreds
of millions of years ago to a few billion

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.480
years ago.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.030
There are a few other things that can also
produce diamonds, like meteor impacts.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.790
These more recent events have the same combination
of heat and pressure, so if carbon is present,

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.400
it can crystallize into a diamond.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.810
But again, this isn’t something happening
everyday.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.670
Luckily for those among us with a penchant
for pretty, shiny things, we can also make

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.180
diamonds in a lab!

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.439
To be clear, a synthetic diamond isn’t the
same as cubic zirconia -- which is a gem made

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:28.430
in a lab from zirconium dioxide (it doesn’t
have the same composition as a diamond) A

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.909
lab-made diamond is a diamond with the exact
same physical structure and chemical composition

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.140
as a stone that’s been mined from the ground.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.010
Which means the recipe is the same: carbon,
heat, and pressure.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.899
One way of making a synthetic diamond is the
“high pressure high temperature” method.

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:48.890
Graphite (yup, pencil lead!) is squeezed by
tiny anvils in a machine while being zapped

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.320
by intense bursts of electricity.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.020
In a few days, that graphite will have crystallized
into a diamond, though it won't be pure since

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.450
there's a metallic solution in the graphite.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.560
Another method is called chemical vapor deposition.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.659
A piece of diamond is put into a depressurizing
chamber filled with natural gas.

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.879
As the gas is zapped with a microwave beam,
it get hot.

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:14.879
This causes carbon atoms to “fall” and
attach themselves to the diamond.

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:19.520
They stick to it making the diamond grow,
turning it into a sheet of pure diamond overnight.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.340
You can even make diamonds in a microwave!

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.980
But please don’t try this at home because
it’s dangerous.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.660
A tiny fragment of diamond is put into a microwave
with a carbon-heavy gas like methane.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.590
The gas is heated to produce a plasma ball,
inside of which the gas breaks down.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.610
The carbon atoms then stick to the diamond
fragment, causing it to grow.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.760
This process can take up to ten weeks before
you’d get a diamond large enough to sell,

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.129
but the resulting stones are so pure even
gemologists need machines to tell them apart

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:48.909
from mined stones.

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.430
Diamonds are more than just pretty, sparkly
things that you wear.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.790
Here are seven really neat uses for diamonds
out in the real world!

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.700
Would you be happy with a diamond made in
a lab or do you need the real thing?
