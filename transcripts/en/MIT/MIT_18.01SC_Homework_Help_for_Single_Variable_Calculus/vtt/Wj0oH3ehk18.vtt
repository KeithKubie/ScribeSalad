JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:08.860
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.470
You've been doing some
work on trig integration.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.240
I have a nice example
here of a problem

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.910
that requires trig
integration in order to solve.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.330
So what I'd like you to do is to
compute the volume of the solid

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.640
that you get when you take one
hump of the curve y equals sine

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.390
a*x and you revolve
it around the x-axis.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.250
So you take the curve between
two consecutive roots,

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.000
and then you, you know,
revolve that around the x-axis

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.190
and that gives you
some, I don't know,

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.580
vaguely football-shaped thing.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.890
And so then the
question is, what's

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.150
the volume of that solid?

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.029
So why don't you pause the
video, take a little while

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:48.570
to work that out, come back,
and we can work it out together.

00:00:57.423 --> 00:00:59.400
Welcome back.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.210
In order to solve
this problem, we just

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.910
are going to apply
our usual methods

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.550
for computing a volume
of a solid of rotation.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.270
So in order to do that, remember
that one of the things you need

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.790
is you need to know the region
over which you're integrating,

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.920
and you need to choose
a method of integration.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.690
So in this case,
looking at this region,

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.440
here, I'm rotating
it around the x-axis.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.780
It looks to me-- so
we have two choices.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.350
We could do shells with
horizontal rectangles,

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.320
or we could do disks
with vertical rectangles.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.140
Looks to me like
vertical rectangles

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.770
are going to be the way
to go for this function.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.670
Nice, simple, have their
base on the x-axis.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.090
You know, this is a
nice setup for disks.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.514
So we're going to take
vertical disks here, like this.

00:01:50.514 --> 00:01:51.930
Vertical rectangles
that are going

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.780
to spin into vertical disks.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.910
And so we're going to
integrate all these disks,

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.580
we're going to add them
up starting at x equals 0,

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.357
and going until the
end of this region.

00:02:02.357 --> 00:02:04.690
So we need to figure out what
the end of that region is,

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.900
so we need sine
a*x to be 0, again.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:14.920
Well, the first 0, the first
time sine is 0 after 0 is

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.090
at pi, so we need a*x to be pi.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.700
So this value is at pi over a.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.200
OK.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.120
So that's the setup
for the problem.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.430
And now we just need
to remember, you know,

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.710
how to do a problem like this.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.000
So we have each of these disks.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.330
Well, its height
here is the height

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.630
of the function, which
is y, in this case.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.790
So the area of a
little disk-- sorry.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.351
The area of a disk,
the little-- oh, dear.

00:02:49.351 --> 00:02:52.570
The element of volume, the
little bit of volume that we

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:58.210
get is equal to-- well, the area
of the disk is pi y squared,

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.210
which is pi sine squared of a*x.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.150
And then the thickness of
the disk is a little dx.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.920
So this is our little
element dV of volume.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.690
And now to get the
whole volume, we just

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.060
integrate this over
the appropriate range.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.590
So this means V is equal to the
integral from 0 to, as we said,

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:32.510
to pi over a of pi times
sine squared of a*x dx.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.880
So this is just like
the sorts of integrals

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.739
you were doing in class.

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:38.780
It's a definite integral.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.740
I guess most of the ones you
did were just anti-derivatives,

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.990
but of course, that's
an easy translation

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.580
to make by via the
fundamental theorem.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.940
So, OK, so we have
this a*x here.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.300
You know, it's up to you.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.050
I think my life will be
simpler if I just make a little

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.850
u-substitution,
get rid of the a*x,

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.266
and then I don't have to think
about it very much anymore.

00:03:58.266 --> 00:04:04.290
So I can take u equals
a*x, so du equals a*dx,

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.530
or dx equals 1 over a du.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.430
So I, OK, so I make
this quick substitution.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.670
When x is 0, u is also 0.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.280
When x is pi over
a, u is just pi.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.155
So this becomes
the integral from 0

00:04:24.155 --> 00:04:27.310
to pi-- I can pull
this pi out front.

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:33.720
And I can pull-- so I'm going
to get pi times sine squared

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.860
u times dx is 1 over a du.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.710
So I'm going to pull the 1
over a out front, as well.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.780
So it's pi over a times the
integral from 0 to pi of sine

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.200
squared u du.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.750
OK.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.010
So now we've just simplified
it to the situation where

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.154
we've just got a trig integral,
no other complications at all.

00:04:54.154 --> 00:04:55.070
How do we do this one?

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.650
Well, OK, so this is not
one of those nice ones

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.870
where we have an odd power
for either sine or cosine.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.820
We have sine is appearing
to the even power of 2,

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.550
and cosine, well,
it doesn't appear.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.150
It appears to the even
power 0, if you like.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.700
You could say it that way.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.330
So when we have
a situation where

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.400
sine and cosine both appear in
even powers, what we need to do

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.020
is we need to use one
of our trig identities.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.790
We need to use a
half angle identity.

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.400
So the identity in particular
that we want to use

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.460
is we want to replace sine
squared u with something

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.940
like a cosine of 2u somehow.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.790
So in order to do that,
we need to remember

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.470
the appropriate identity.

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:40.990
So one of the double angle
identities is cosine of 2t

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.890
equals 1 minus 2
sine squared t, which

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:52.660
we can rewrite as the half angle
identity sine squared t equals

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.510
1 minus cosine 2t over 2.

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.060
So this is true for any value t.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.086
In particular, it's true
when t is equal to u.

00:06:03.086 --> 00:06:03.710
Back over here.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:09.430
So we can rewrite this by
replacing sine squared u

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.330
with 1 minus cosine
of 2u divided by 2.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:18.340
So this integral becomes, so
our integral is equal to-- well,

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.630
we've still got the pi over a
in the front-- integral from 0

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:34.240
to pi of 1 minus
cosine of 2u over 2 du.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.880
OK, and so now we integrate it.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.160
So 1 over 2, that's easy.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:43.050
That's just-- so, OK, so the pi
over a is still out in front.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:47.340
1 over 2 integrates,
just gives us u over 2.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.020
How about cosine of 2u?

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.510
Well, so minus
cosine of 2u, so that

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:55.860
should give us a minus sine.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:56.700
Right?

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.780
Derivative of sine is cosine,
derivative of minus sine

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.000
is minus cosine.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.430
So its minus sine of 2u,
and then because it's 2u,

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.330
we're going to have
to divide by 2 again.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.810
So over 4.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:16.741
All right.

00:07:16.741 --> 00:07:18.198
If you don't believe
me, of course,

00:07:18.198 --> 00:07:20.590
you could always check by
differentiating this expression

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.730
and making sure that it matches
that expression, the integrand,

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:25.650
here.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:28.370
And OK, and so we need
to take that between u

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.802
equals 0 and u equals pi.

00:07:30.802 --> 00:07:32.760
So luckily we changed
our bounds of integration

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:36.950
and we don't have to go all
the way back to x again.

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:46.740
OK, so this is pi
over a times-- OK,

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:54.310
so u over 2 minus sine, 2u
over 4 when u is pi over 2

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:57.200
minus sine of 2 pi.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.990
That's just 0, right?

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:01.550
Yes, that's just 0.

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:02.050
Good.

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:03.440
So this term is just 0.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:07.680
pi over 2 minus-- OK, now
when we put in 0, here,

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.700
well, we get 0 minus sine
of 0, so that's just 0-- so

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:13.631
just pi over 2.

00:08:13.631 --> 00:08:14.130
OK.

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:20.380
So the answer, then,
is pi squared over 2a.

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.440
So that's the volume
we were looking for.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:29.950
So just to quickly recap, we
have our solid of revolution

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:34.180
here that we get by spinning
this region around the x-axis.

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:37.220
We use our typical methods
for computing volumes

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.660
of solids of revolution.

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:43.090
We've got a, when we do that,
the integral that we set up

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:45.670
is a trig integral with
a sine squared in it.

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:48.290
So both sine and cosine
appear to an even power

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:49.610
in this trig integral.

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:51.370
When you're in that
situation, you're

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:54.550
going to have to use your
half angle formulas, like so.

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:56.310
Once you do that,
you'll simplify.

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:59.330
Sometimes life is hard, you'll
have to do it more than once.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.250
In this case, we only
had to do that once,

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.730
so we got-- then
we-- that reduces

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:09.160
the integral to something
that's easy to compute,

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.350
where you have one
of sine or cosine

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:13.040
always appearing
to an odd power.

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.350
In this case, very simple.

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:17.060
You just had a cosine.

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:21.240
And then you integrate it,
and this was our final answer.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.463
I'll end there.
