[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.090
PATRICK BRADY: Hello, and
welcome to Google I/O 2017.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.090
I'm Patrick Brady from the
Android team at Google,

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.610
and I'm here with AJ and
Chen to give you guys

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.752
an update on Android in cars.

00:00:17.752 --> 00:00:19.210
We have a lot to
cover today, and I

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.310
see there's still
people streaming in.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.670
But let's buckle
up and get driving.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.560
The automotive industry
is really heating up.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.410
I think that's no secret.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.700
We see cars rapidly transforming
from disconnected mechanical

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.910
machines to powerful
connected computers on wheels.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.650
The controls are shifting from
mechanical knobs and dials

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.470
to software defined interfaces
accessible through touch

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.300
screens and voice controls.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.210
Cars are getting more sensors
and screens, microphones,

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.060
connectivity, and compute power.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.270
We also see a convergence
between the mobile and

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.720
automotive worlds, creating
exciting opportunities

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.300
to revolutionize the way
we interact with our cars

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.590
today, through open platforms,
artificial intelligence,

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.720
and vibrant
developer ecosystems.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.900
Android Auto is an effort
from Google and our partners

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.750
to bring all of these
advances together and create

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.930
a safe and seamless experience
for drivers everywhere.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.650
It's still early days, but today
anyone with an Android Auto

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.780
compatible car can
see the beginnings

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.700
of this vision at
work with access

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.740
to their favorite Android apps
right from the car's display.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.470
We continue to expand the number
of Android Auto compatible

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.110
models available through
great partnerships

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.420
with over 50 car brands.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.990
There are over 300 Android
Auto cars available today--

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.830
compatible cars available
today, including first launches

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.570
from Chrysler, Renault, Volvo
in the last few months alone.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.260
And that's triple the number
from just one year ago.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.440
It's well on its way to
becoming a standard feature

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.750
in every new car.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.890
But, of course, we know that
not everyone has a new car.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.740
And so we've also
made the Android Auto

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.450
app available as a standalone
experience on Android phones.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.270
This opens up the
platform and ecosystem

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.950
to many millions of drivers
no matter what kind of car

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:24.450
they drive.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.010
Whether you're looking to
stay connected with WhatsApp,

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.170
Facebook Messenger or Allo,
or pass the time with NPR 1

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.700
and audio books from
Audible, or the latest album

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.130
release on Spotify,
the apps drivers

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.310
want on the road are available
through Android Auto.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.580
And before anyone asks,
Ways is now hitting beta,

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.850
so we're very excited to welcome
them into Android Auto as well.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.600
We're seeing strong growth on
the developer front, as well.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.840
In fact, we've seen a
50% increase in auto

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.390
enabled apps in the Play
Store since last year.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.210
But none of this would matter
if we didn't have users, right?

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.490
Well, I'm happy to say
that Android Auto usage is

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.060
growing like crazy, as well.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.980
Here's where we were
at Google I/O 2016.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.730
And here's where we
are today at I/O 2017.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.270
We've seen a 10x growth in
usage over the last year alone.

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.130
And the strong
trajectory continues.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.340
But this is really
just the beginning,

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.710
and we're really more
excited about where Android

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.000
is going on the road ahead.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.460
Last year at I/O we
announced that we're

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.910
building automotive features
right into the Android platform

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.990
to make it a turnkey
solution for cars every bit

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.100
as much an automotive platform
as it is a mobile platform

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.930
today.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.550
We're doing this
because we believe

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.630
open platforms are powerful
enablers of ecosystems.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.880
They reduce the
cost of development,

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.130
and they speed time to market.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.850
In a sense, they
accelerate innovation.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.040
We're also doing this
because it enables

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.709
us to deliver an even
more seamless driving

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.560
experience with all the
information controls

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.950
and connectivity available
through a single system that's

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.130
infused with the driver's
identity, their digital life,

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.140
and context.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.570
We listen and learn from
partners who had already

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.270
brought Android into
automotive, and we

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.040
worked hard to solve
the challenges they

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.450
hit along the way--

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.180
a robust and full-featured
Bluetooth stack.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.080
A standard way to connect with
the cabin controls for Windows

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.990
and air conditioning
and car sensors,

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.050
a system that boots instantly.

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.610
At Google I/O 2016, we showed
this all off with Android

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.550
Nougat powering the entire
in-car experience of a concept

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:58.510
Maserati--

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.580
the windows, the doors,
the air conditioning,

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.100
the instrument cluster.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.850
And as much as we really
loved that Maserati,

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.750
and I'd really like
to take it home.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.800
It was a concept, and
I think what we want--

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.520
and what we think you all want--

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.740
is to see real cars
running modern,

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:15.955
Android powered systems.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.210
The traction we're seeing in
the industry is pretty amazing.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.090
Just a few short months after
the official Android Nougat

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.670
release, several of
our partners were

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.100
demoing Android powered
infotainment systems

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.630
at CES 2017, including
Chrysler's Android powered U

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.430
Connect system.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.980
Earlier this week, the
automotive industry

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.930
heavyweight with a
reputation for building

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.840
some of the most advanced
systems on the market--

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.900
Audi-- announced that they will
build their next generation

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.180
infotainment systems on Android.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.910
Please join me in
welcoming Alfons Pfaller,

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:56.030
Head of Connected Car and
Infotainment at Audi AG.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:07:11.750
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.080
Patrick, and our
friends from Google,

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.670
thank you all very, very
much for being here.

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:23.620
That we got the invitation to be
a at the Google I/O. For Audi,

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:27.350
it's the third time that
we are here at the I/O.

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:30.050
And for Audi, a
Google I/O is really,

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:31.910
really a special event--

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.770
a great event.

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:38.012
We have a very, very long
term relationship with Google,

00:07:38.012 --> 00:07:39.470
and together Patrick
and your team,

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:44.180
we have been able to launch
a lot of really cool services

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.110
over the last years.

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:48.980
We started with Google
Earth-- amazing.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:54.570
[INAUDIBLE], BUI, Street
View, a lot of things.

00:07:54.570 --> 00:08:00.590
And now the really big
next step is coming.

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:03.800
If you are looking
on the picture--

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:10.670
on this picture we see up
brand new Audi interior design.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:20.380
This design is based on the
best in class digital cockpit

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.870
technology.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:30.910
And we see here three absolute
automotive high-end displays

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:37.120
in the front, and additional
displays in the form.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:41.559
Based on this
digital cockpit, we

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:47.360
are able to bring it in a
really, really amazing design,

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:53.860
and really straightforward,
excellent user experience.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.890
And in this interior
design, we are

00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:03.130
doing a seamless integration
of embedded Android.

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:06.070
And I think that is
really, really a big step.

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:09.190
If I am to do a short
summary in terms of time,

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:10.840
what's ongoing automotive?

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:13.690
We are bringing together
with our silicon [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:18.400
partners really, really high
end computing inside the car.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.600
Next step is with our friends
from mobile communication,

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:28.310
we are connecting all
cars with high-speed LTE,

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:33.940
and very soon also is 5G to
the whole cloud ecosystem.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:39.010
Now the point is
this embedded Android

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:44.710
we are able to provide an
open platform for automotive.

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:50.590
And this enables
us to invite you--

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.900
to invite all of you--

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:58.430
to participate in automotive
development, and that's great.

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:00.730
So thanks very much,
and looking forward

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:04.660
to seeing this concept
on our show car outside.

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:07.220
And have [INAUDIBLE]
force of discussion.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:08.279
Thank you very much.

00:10:08.279 --> 00:10:09.239
Thanks.

00:10:09.239 --> 00:10:10.155
PATRICK BRADY: Thanks.

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:15.680
Thank you Alfons.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.330
We couldn't be more
excited to partner

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:21.770
with Audi again to bring
Android into their future cars.

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:24.680
But you can't build an ecosystem
with just one partnership,

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:25.880
right?

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.910
And that's why I'm happy to say
that one of the industry's most

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:30.560
innovative companies--

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:33.710
Volvo-- is also putting their
weight behind the Android

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:35.510
in-car ecosystem.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.810
I'm happy to welcome up
Henrik Green, Senior Vice

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:41.840
President of Research and
Development at Volvo Car Group

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.740
to tell you a bit
about their new system.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.115
HENRIK GREEN:
Thank you, Patrick.

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:53.260
Good afternoon, and
thank you the friends

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.500
at Google for inviting us
here to this great event.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:59.450
Thank you for the
sun, and most of all,

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:02.110
thank you for the sunscreen.

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:04.720
I haven't looked at the
mirror yet, so I'm not sure.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:08.560
But I'm definitely
burned on the right side.

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.330
I mean, we have
worked with Google

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:13.360
for a number of years on a
different size of projects,

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.650
and, of course, the
recent Android Auto

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:18.710
is a fantastic success of that.

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:22.450
But today we're here to
announce that our partnership is

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:24.730
going to the next level.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:27.010
We are, together
with Google team

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:32.050
here, going to develop the next
generation of connected car

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:34.450
infotainment.

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:38.290
And as always for Volvo,
it's very important for us

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:41.560
to create a completely
seamless solution

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:45.520
where the user experience is
at the heart of everybody,

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:50.290
and that we can provide a better
life, and a better experience

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:57.240
through the integrated use
of this infotainment system.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:01.290
Now, the design of a UX
system plays, of course,

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:04.320
an enormous important
role, but at the heart of

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.200
it is the operating system.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.150
And here we strongly believe,
that together with Google,

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:13.740
we will develop the next
generation based on the Android

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:15.280
platform.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:21.310
So, again, it's
to you out there--

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:23.440
you are the developers.

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:26.890
You are now the people
and the brain power

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:33.050
that will bring this experience
to life in the future cars.

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:35.540
So be with us here
and show that we

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:39.170
can make the best connected
infotainment system and car

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:41.990
experience out there.

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:43.856
Thank you so much.

00:12:43.856 --> 00:13:37.240
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:40.030
PATRICK BRADY: It's
pretty cool, right?

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:43.410
I definitely I definitely
encourage you to go check

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:45.360
out the demos that
Audi and Volvo are

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:48.810
showing in the Android
and IOT booths out there.

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:51.750
As good as the cars
look up on the screens,

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:53.760
they look even better in person.

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.070
Sadly, I have to say
we're not giving out

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:59.330
any free cars this
year at I/O, so you'll

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:01.800
have to make do with a t-shirt.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.310
But Audi and Volvo are
really true pioneers

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:07.860
in automotive electronics
and infotainment,

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:10.080
and we couldn't have
picked better partners

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:13.170
to usher in the future
of connected cars.

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:15.900
We're really, really
excited about that.

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.240
With the Android
Auto app on phones,

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.740
with 300 Android Auto
compatible car models,

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:25.290
and with Android built in
systems hitting the road soon,

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:27.630
we're pushing forward
to revolutionize

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:30.180
the way we stay
connected in our cars,

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:33.180
creating a safe and seamless
connected experience

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:35.420
for drivers everywhere.

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:39.470
But a big part of the
driver's digital life--

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:41.480
as Henrik and Alfons said--

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.370
is the applications
and services they

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:46.810
use throughout their digital
life on their other devices.

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:50.100
And we need to bring the
ecosystem along for the ride.

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:53.060
So I'd like to
welcome up onstage AJ

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.540
Kimbembe from the Android Auto
UX team to talk about what this

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:57.830
all means for developers.

00:15:01.177 --> 00:15:02.510
AJ KIMBEMBE: Thank you, Patrick.

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:06.380
Thank you, Patrick.

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:07.560
And hi, everyone.

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:10.520
My name is AJ, and I am the
lead designer for Android

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.740
in-car infotainment.

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.830
Patrick already detailed how
we've been out at work to make

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:19.010
Android the best possible
infotainment platform.

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:22.120
We've can plug-in to Bluetooth,
BlueTIME, car control--

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:26.480
such as HVAC, radio car
sensors, closers, and so on.

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.790
But Android is not
only a great platform,

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:33.290
it's also an entire ecosystem
of apps and services.

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:36.590
But first, I would like to talk
about why are we doing this?

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:40.610
So this is natural for
our field research.

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:43.130
This driver is trying to
catch Pokemons on Pokemon

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:44.995
Go while at the wheel.

00:15:44.995 --> 00:15:47.700
And you can see the family
crossing in the background.

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.480
So don't worry,
everybody is safe.

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:53.140
And again, this is
not a stock image.

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:56.870
This is our researchers in
the car with the drivers

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:58.310
out on the road.

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:00.980
And now if this is happening
with our researchers

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:06.260
in the vehicle, the gist of
it is our internal research

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:07.490
shows that people--

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:09.750
drivers-- wants
to stay connected,

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:11.750
and they may result to
use their phone to do so,

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:16.250
and that can lead to situations
that are fundamentally unsafe.

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:17.990
We want to have
drivers stay connected

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:21.320
with your interface auto
safe and predictable.

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:23.930
So I'd like to [INAUDIBLE]
three things here--

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:27.500
why it's complex to design
services for the car.

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:30.410
What Android is doing to
help as a platform then.

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:32.450
And finally, what
are the various ways

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:37.410
that you can integrate with
Android Auto as a developer.

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:41.300
OK, what is making
designing apps and services

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:46.350
for the car specific, exciting,
but sometimes challenging?

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:48.350
Android is a platform
for infotainment

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:51.427
across a wide range of
possible surfaces with shapes,

00:16:51.427 --> 00:16:53.510
aspect ratio, that could
be different-- densities,

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:54.680
fidelities.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:58.220
A car interior is a
meticulously crafted experience.

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.830
Everything is optimized
for safety, of course,

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:03.170
but also to provide
a specific experience

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:05.490
for each brand and
each price point.

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:09.440
This space can big, small, wide,
tall, [INAUDIBLE] close or as

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.920
of this place.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.450
Android is a platform that
supports all of these.

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:16.880
But along with the
outputs, the inputs methods

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.530
are multiple, as well.

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:21.260
Touchscreens are more and
more common in the cars,

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:25.089
but also D-pad, touchpad, rotary
inputs, and many more cause

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:26.119
of that as well.

00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:28.760
And some systems are even
hybrids of multiple input

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:30.920
mechanism, and
Android is a platform

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.730
that supports that, as well.

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:37.174
Safety-- safety, of
course, is our priority.

00:17:37.174 --> 00:17:38.590
We are working
really, really hard

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:41.830
to reduce driver distraction,
visual distraction, minor

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:44.230
distraction,
cognitive distraction.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:48.520
Our internal user research team
works closely and interactively

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.580
with the broader team to
strengthen understanding

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:55.840
of in-vehicle
driver interaction,

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:58.470
and also to get our
feature developments.

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:00.830
Our team conduct
definitional research--

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:02.860
the studies, the
needs assessment,

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:06.310
usability evaluation, quantity
surveys and formal driver

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:08.680
distraction testing, as well.

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.650
Also engaging the positive
working relationship

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:14.890
with [INAUDIBLE] organization
and to stay up to date

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:17.640
with the regulation standards.

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:20.890
And we do all that so our
partners and developers

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:22.720
don't have to do it.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:26.510
So you can see that our driving
simulator is an expensive set

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:32.140
up that can offer us, at least,
simulate driving conditions.

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:34.130
We use it for many
things, including

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:36.340
the detection
[INAUDIBLE] on task

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:40.364
that is one way that we use
to evaluate cognitive load.

00:18:40.364 --> 00:18:41.530
We also use it eye tracking.

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:45.420
You can see on the picture Katie
with the apparatus on her face.

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:47.590
And we also use the
Octagon glasses.

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:49.270
The little tool that
we use to simulate

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:52.810
a driver focusing on the road
and glancing at the eye--

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:54.760
they close and they open.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:58.090
What I would like to say is,
it's a complex and expensive

00:18:58.090 --> 00:18:58.870
endeavor.

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:01.497
And again, we are doing all
that so our partners and drivers

00:19:01.497 --> 00:19:03.080
don't have to worry
too much about it.

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:12.730
OK, so now to what Android
is doing to add developers.

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:14.830
So, like we said
earlier, we know

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:17.080
that drivers want to
stay connected, and want

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:20.530
to have them with interface
that are safe and predictable,

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:21.970
but the content--

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:23.980
the context and the
[INAUDIBLE] free nature

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:28.020
of modern digital services
can make that a challenge.

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:32.230
The content of infotainment
used to be more predictable.

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:33.850
Now with Android
we are designing

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:37.890
a system that is ready to
safely bring into cost services

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:41.470
that we know autos use on other
platforms, and that we like,

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:42.620
as well.

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:44.080
Android is already
a great platform

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.940
for more digital services--

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:49.300
on phones, on tablets, on
TVs, on wear-ables, and now

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:53.240
we are bringing that
into cars, as well.

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:56.050
The key to adapt
quickly and efficiently

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:59.170
to the wide diversity of
human machine interfaces

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:02.530
that we find in the
industry is modularity.

00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:05.830
Android is abstracting
away the inputs and outputs

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:08.020
so developers don't have
to worry about screen size

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:10.720
or shapes, or whether
something is touch or rotary.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.610
We take care of that.

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:14.530
Android also provides
an in-car platform

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:17.470
so developers can quit
to innovate and focus

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:19.554
on building innovative
apps without having

00:20:19.554 --> 00:20:20.845
to worry about all the details.

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:26.510
One way Android does the
heavy lifting for developers

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:28.310
is through templates.

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:31.190
We've designed a system that
enabled automotive grade

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:34.190
templates to safely
and effectively perform

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:37.040
the most common driving tasks.

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:39.590
Those templates are designed
to connect to a wide variety

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:41.372
of regulatory concerns.

00:20:41.372 --> 00:20:42.830
So for instance,
for Spotify, don't

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:47.250
have to worry about what is the
target size for some screens

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:48.830
or how many items
can be displayed

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:51.320
on one screen in a
given country or region.

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:54.100
We take care of that.

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:55.880
And another way we
make Android in the Car

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.210
a predictable
experience is with apps.

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:00.830
Although powerful,
the app grid is not

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:05.100
the most suitable metaphor
for the automotive space.

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:07.850
If I notified the key
areas for the car and made

00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:09.930
it easy to switch between them.

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:12.830
And it's not only in our
own Android auto platform.

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:14.570
You can see this
today, for example,

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:17.360
in the best in class systems
designed by our partners--

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.740
Audi and Volvo.

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:21.920
And be able to take them
after the IOT and Android

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:23.020
right outside.

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:25.910
Here, the most
commonly used functions

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:29.420
are elevated so drivers can
quickly and safely switch

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:32.670
between them without having to
make their way to an upgrade.

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:39.620
We also want the experience
to feel personal and tailored.

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:42.140
We work hard to make sure
that Android understands when

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:45.620
a driver is in the car
and can optimize its self

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:49.100
to safely bring the
drivers apps and services.

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:51.740
Android is already built
in with much user support.

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:53.630
It's been a few years now.

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:55.930
And we are fully
leveraging this framework

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:59.870
in the vehicle to enable
frictionless personalization.

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:01.245
We want to get to
the point where

00:22:01.245 --> 00:22:04.172
a driver can step
into a rental car

00:22:04.172 --> 00:22:06.380
and have an experience that
is personalized and ready

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:06.879
to drive.

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:12.380
Now onto the last portion--

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:14.930
what are the different ways
that you can bring your Apple

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:16.540
service into cars.

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:23.070
Android is a common platform
that millions of Americans

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:25.650
already know how to build for.

00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:29.520
If you're already invested
in Android system,

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:32.310
we want to make
things easy for you.

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:34.950
Android, as a platform,
does the heavy lifting,

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:37.470
and provides a set
of tools and APIs

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:39.540
to integrate very
easily with the car.

00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:43.980
Our goal is to have one single
platform across every car.

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:47.130
Let's look at that
in more details.

00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:49.710
We want to be respectful
of the time and resources

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:51.855
that are required to
commit to bring the app

00:22:51.855 --> 00:22:53.364
and services to the car.

00:22:53.364 --> 00:22:54.780
That's why there
are multiple ways

00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:56.550
you can integrate
with Android Auto,

00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:59.990
depending on the nature of
your service, of course.

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:04.530
For a few of those apps, it will
require a lot of more effort--

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:07.300
a lot more design time, and
possibly more cost, as well--

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:10.140
but for most of the app, it will
be less effort and less time

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.440
that will be involved.

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:15.150
What we call full
app, or services

00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:17.860
that need full control of what
is displayed on the screen--

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:22.310
I'll elect the examples
here, in the [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:25.920
the Volvo S90 that is on demo.

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:30.020
Google Maps is using dynamic,
Collarbone, pinchable maps

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:33.690
appitized bringing a
full app experience--

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:38.340
[INAUDIBLE] a huge amount of
human and technical resources.

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:41.760
You have to think about target
size, type size, day and night

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:43.500
done, focus best system--

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:46.170
such as rotary
input on touchpads.

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:49.110
All of these, then, required
full testing capabilities

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:52.260
to ensure that the resulting
app is up to formal standards

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:55.830
regarding driver distraction.

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:58.300
Waze is another example
of an application

00:23:58.300 --> 00:23:59.980
that we are full
peaks in control.

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:02.739
As you can see here,
presenting our Android Auto

00:24:02.739 --> 00:24:03.905
for your car screen version.

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:10.100
Not all the apps are
making application, though.

00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:12.170
For audio apps,
we've created a set

00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:14.483
of templates that
safely offer all

00:24:14.483 --> 00:24:17.510
the necessary functionalities
in a simple, predictable,

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:19.020
and safe manner.

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:23.059
Here we like the example of
the Audi q8 sport concept

00:24:23.059 --> 00:24:24.100
that is on demo, as well.

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:33.050
You can see how Audi
elegantly implemented

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:36.040
the media station API that they
can use to bring their media

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.810
app into cars.

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:40.970
The templates are working
off all our surfaces,

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:43.700
screen densities, and inputs
and they are rigorously

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.160
tested for driver distraction.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:49.370
And the great thing is all
of the applications that

00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:52.430
are already working with Android
Auto for your phone's screen

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:54.740
or for your car screen
will be working here,

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:58.940
as well without extra
work from our developers.

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:03.050
And you can also see
how Audi implemented

00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:06.920
media browse API, and here
presented with Pocket Casts,

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.480
so we can find
your content easily

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:14.390
and safely in [INAUDIBLE] and
right in place in the car.

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:18.110
Messaging is one of the major
use case in the car-- for SMS,

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:22.410
but also apps such as WhatsApp
or Facebook Messenger, or Auto.

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:24.980
Intuition with Auto
is simple and based

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:27.110
on Android notifications.

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:30.170
All that is necessary is to
integrate with our Car Extender

00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:32.960
object with a safe,
voice centric message

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:35.490
experience for your users.

00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:39.970
This is another example of
the media station implemented

00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:41.030
with [INAUDIBLE] one.

00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:46.280
But here you can see a WhatsApp
notification showing up.

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:50.160
We've made them working grades
for safe and practical use

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:53.360
on a phone that is mounted on
your dashboard of your car.

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:56.720
And the great thing is that
[INAUDIBLE] for WhatsApp we can

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:58.970
make it work on different
on different phone factors--

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:02.420
Android Auto for your
car screen and that

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:05.150
is working for touch, but
also focus-based system,

00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:06.230
such as rotary inputs.

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.665
Another way to
integrate with auto

00:26:10.665 --> 00:26:13.390
is through the Google Assistant.

00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:16.070
Assistant based apps and
services are inherently

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:18.560
cross-platform, and their
voice centric nature

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:22.190
makes them ideally
suited for in-car use.

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:24.540
The next speaker is going
to talk more about that.

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:26.690
And so we not explain it
into more detail here.

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:31.610
So that's what we
are working hard on

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:34.880
to enable a healthy
ecosystem with Android.

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:37.910
We work hard to have
tucked away the complexity

00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:39.920
and provide developers
and car manufacturers

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:44.120
with a robust, up-to-date,
and secure platform.

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:46.930
Now we'd like to welcome Chen
Xiao to talk more about how

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:50.080
you can integrate with Google
Assistants on Android Auto.

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:50.580
Thank you.

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:01.110
CHEN XIAO: Thank you, AJ.

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:04.350
Hello, I'm Chen,
Technical Lead and Manager

00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:07.250
on the Google Assistant
on Android Auto Team,

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:10.260
and I'm here to tell you
about how you, the developers,

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:13.350
can engage with
users in the car.

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:16.140
See if this scenario
sounds familiar.

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:19.230
You're running late for work
and you rush out the door.

00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:22.170
On your drive, you
think back to yourself,

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:24.870
did I actually locked
the front door?

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:27.970
Wouldn't it be awesome if you
could talk to your car and say,

00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:31.200
OK Google, did I lock the door?

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:34.110
Or maybe on that same
commute, you're thinking,

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:36.180
what meetings am I
actually rushing to?

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:40.470
Or, I better not forget to
buy milk before I go home.

00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:43.330
It'd be great if you could
talk to your car and say,

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:45.000
what's my next meeting?

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.070
Or, remind me to buy
milk before I go home,

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:52.410
these are all things
that the Google Assistant

00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:54.120
can help you with.

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:57.330
And more importantly,
you as a developer,

00:27:57.330 --> 00:28:00.690
can make your services
available via the assistant.

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:06.220
As AJ has mentioned
before, voice input

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:08.380
is critical in the car.

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:10.510
For safety reasons,
we want to make

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:13.570
sure the users keep
their eyes on the road

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:16.060
and hands on the wheel.

00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:18.280
While the users are
on this journey,

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:20.140
we want to make
sure the user stays

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:24.567
connected, they can get things
done, and stay entertained.

00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:30.620
The Google Assistant can
provide that intelligent and

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:34.400
conversational voice as we
move from a mobile first

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:36.890
to an AI first world.

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:39.350
We want it to be
the ultimate copilot

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:41.930
for the user in the car.

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:44.420
Users are spending
precious time in the car,

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:46.340
and we're making
the assistant help

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:49.790
the user complete the mission
and make the journey fun.

00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:57.650
With the feature called My Day,
you can say, OK Google, tell me

00:28:57.650 --> 00:28:59.150
about my day.

00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:02.810
And the assistant will tell you
about upcoming calendar events,

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:07.700
reminders, commute traffic, so
you can hit the ground running

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:10.610
when you get to work.

00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:15.110
On the road, your assistant can
tell you about traffic ahead,

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:18.020
or show you gas stations if
you need to make a pit stop.

00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:23.250
If you're bored, you
can ask the assistant

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:25.980
to play that favorite
song you've downloaded

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:29.130
or listen to a variety
of music and pod casts.

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:35.310
We know that staying connected
is very important for users

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:38.340
on the road, so we make
calling and messaging

00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:43.680
easy with voice actions like,
call mom, send a WhatsApp

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:46.490
message, or read my messages.

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.440
Many of these
experiences are only

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:55.260
possible because
developers like you have

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:57.510
implemented the right APIs.

00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:59.940
So thank you for helping
us create that great user

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:00.660
experience.

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:06.170
Since the assistant
is cross surface,

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:10.550
it will help the users get
things done wherever they are--

00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:12.810
in the home, and on the go.

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:19.070
Patrick and AJ have already
talked about messaging

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:22.130
and media apps can
integrate with Android Auto

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:26.720
for a seamless and consistent
user experience in the car.

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.880
Those are the templated
and notification

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:33.260
apps in AJ's pyramid
that want to show a UI.

00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:35.360
But there are tons of
other apps that don't

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:37.760
fall under these categories.

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:41.300
How can you, as a developer,
get your experience in the car

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:44.240
without having to deal with
the complexity of building

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:47.810
a full automotive app and having
to accommodate different screen

00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:50.105
sizes, various
inputs, and outputs?

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:56.400
If your service can be
voice centric in the car,

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:58.160
and you want a
lightweight integration

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:01.490
for reaching these users,
then the good Google Assistant

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:03.600
is a good option.

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:08.260
So how do you build for
the Google Assistant?

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:10.390
Actions on Google
is the platform

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:14.200
for developers to build
for the Google Assistant.

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:17.530
The platform allowed developers
to reach users wherever

00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:20.020
the assistant is available.

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:22.360
The platform uses
cloud execution

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:25.150
so users don't need
to preinstall any app.

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:27.670
When they ask for
your service by name,

00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:31.510
you'll be connected immediately.

00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:34.030
Many developers are already
building for the Actions

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:35.620
on Google.

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:37.630
When building for
Actions on Google,

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:39.820
there are three key
pieces that need to be

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:42.260
defined by the developer--

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:48.190
invocation triggers,
dialog, and fulfillment.

00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:50.890
Let me illustrate
with an example.

00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:54.130
I like coding, and I
like fortune cookies.

00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:56.020
So I want to build
a service that

00:31:56.020 --> 00:32:01.380
gives me a daily dose of
coding fortune cookies.

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:05.700
So the first step is I need to
define my invocation trigger.

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:08.640
How does the user
connect to my service?

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.980
What do they
actually have to say?

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:13.020
In this case, I'll
make it simple.

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:16.900
Whenever the user says, talk
to coding, fortune cookie,

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:20.040
then the Google Assistant will
connect the user to my service.

00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:25.370
The next step is dialogues.

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:28.360
So once the user is
connected to my service,

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:30.260
how do I talk to them?

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:32.170
What kind of
information am I asking,

00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:35.060
and what kind of
responses am I expecting?

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:36.800
What are valid responses?

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.140
What are valid responses?

00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:44.160
In this case, I'm going to
make it a simple question--

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:48.470
do they want a Java,
or c++ fortune cookie?

00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:51.810
So there are only two valid
responses in this case.

00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:54.800
So let's suppose that
the user picked Java.

00:32:54.800 --> 00:33:00.520
Now we can move on to the third
step, which is fulfillment.

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:03.040
For fulfillment, I have
all the information

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:06.010
that I need, so how do
I go about committing

00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:09.580
that transaction or executing
that action on behalf

00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:11.300
of the use?

00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:13.000
So in this case,
I'm going to look

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.430
in my bank of Java
fortunes, and I'm

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:17.770
going to pick one
out for today--

00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:20.560
random one.

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:23.140
Today's fortune
says Confucius says,

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:25.840
for true happiness
prefer interfaces

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.600
over abstract classes.

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:30.497
That's one I actually
use everyday.

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:38.020
That's a high level view
of actions on Google.

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:40.510
The Google Assistant
and Actions on Google

00:33:40.510 --> 00:33:44.890
are coming to Android Auto and
will open up a wide possibility

00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:46.570
of use cases.

00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:49.940
Agents and services that are
built on top of the platform

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:52.330
will transfer over.

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:55.050
If you think that users will
interact with your agent

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:58.390
or service in the
car, it's a good idea

00:33:58.390 --> 00:34:00.850
to start thinking
about, what is the user

00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:05.360
experience you want to build
for that special context?

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:09.159
One car-specific consideration
is safety and driver

00:34:09.159 --> 00:34:10.810
distraction.

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:13.210
How can you build
a user experience

00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:16.840
that both minimizes driver
distraction and allows

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:20.064
users to get things done
and stay entertained?

00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:24.530
Let's think about
some potential use

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:28.360
cases for engaging
with users in the car.

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:29.480
What is possible here?

00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:34.800
One idea is reservations.

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:36.630
It's a Friday night,
and I'm meeting up

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:38.310
with my husband for dinner.

00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:40.530
We pick out a restaurant,
and on the way

00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:44.040
there, I would love to be
able to say, book a table--

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:48.389
and have that table waiting
for me by the time I get there.

00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:51.020
What would be even more
awesome and magical

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:54.480
is if the Google Assistant
and that third party service

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:57.480
can suggest a good
reservation time that

00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:01.650
takes into account my
location, traffic, and maybe

00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:05.340
parking availability so I
make a reservation for a time

00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:06.650
that I can definitely make.

00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:11.850
Another idea is food ordering.

00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:15.860
I'm working late on a weeknight
and I'm too lazy to cook.

00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:17.840
On my way home, I
would love to be

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:21.020
able to put in an order
at my favorite restaurant

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:24.440
and have that food delivered
and arrived at my home

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:26.060
by the time I get there.

00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:27.830
Saves on time, saves on cooking.

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:33.620
Like I mentioned
earlier, how many times

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:35.210
have you driven
away from your house

00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:37.010
and can't remember
whether you've actually

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:38.600
locked the front door?

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:42.740
It'd be very cool if you could
say, OK Google, check my door.

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:44.509
Or, did I lock my door?

00:35:44.509 --> 00:35:45.050
Just lock it.

00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:51.450
Another one is lights.

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:55.200
I'm driving home and I actually
hate walking into a dark house

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.780
because I'm actually
afraid of the dark.

00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:59.940
It would be great if from
the car I could just say,

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:01.740
turn on my living room lights.

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:03.630
Or turn on my
dining room lights,

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:06.200
and I never have to walk
into a dark house again.

00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:12.970
Games and entertainment--
how many times

00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:15.900
have you been on long
road trips with kids

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:19.570
where you struggle to find a
way to keep them entertained?

00:36:19.570 --> 00:36:23.110
Wouldn't it be awesome if you
could say, OK Google, entertain

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:25.660
my kids and have
games that are age

00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:27.730
appropriate for
different kids so they

00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:29.740
can play whatever they want?

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:32.570
They stay entertained and
I can focus on the road.

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:39.680
These are just some ideas
on ways developers can

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:41.930
engage with users in the car.

00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:45.710
I look forward to what creative
ideas you come up with.

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:47.960
Please check out the
Actions on Google site

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:50.540
where there are actually
code samples and tools

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:53.330
to help you build the
dialogue, and triggers,

00:36:53.330 --> 00:36:55.880
and fulfillment steps
so that makes it easier

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:57.890
to bring up your service.

00:36:57.890 --> 00:37:00.937
We also have demos at
IOT and Android domes

00:37:00.937 --> 00:37:03.020
where we'll actually be
showcasing some of the use

00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:06.300
cases that I just talked about,
including controlling hue

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:11.150
lights and August door locks
directly from inside the car.

00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:12.770
Thank you, and back to Patrick.

00:37:19.224 --> 00:37:20.390
PATRICK BRADY: Thanks, Chen.

00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:23.120
It's really exciting to see
a new way for developers

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:26.300
to easily extend their
services into cars.

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:28.430
With conversational voice,
powered by the Google

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:31.940
Assistant, we hope to see many
new types of apps and use cases

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:34.910
by next I/O. We
also heard from AJ

00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:36.770
earlier on how
media and messaging

00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:41.360
apps can extend into the
car through a scalable way

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:45.320
with Android Auto templates
and notification extensions.

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:47.270
Android Auto and
the Google Assistant

00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:50.330
abstract most of the complexity
of automotive development

00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:52.940
so that you can just worry
about building a great app

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:57.410
and experience for your drivers.

00:37:57.410 --> 00:37:59.720
This model has helped
Android Auto grow

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:02.720
to be the largest
in-car ecosystem today,

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:04.400
and it's about to get
a whole lot bigger

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.200
with the Google Assistant.

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:09.890
With 10x growth and users over
the last year, and new partners

00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:12.530
like Audi and Volvo
building Android directly

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:15.380
into their cars, we
know that developers

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:17.600
are going to have
plenty of eager drivers

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:20.510
out there who want to stay
connected on the road.

00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:23.570
So we're excited to continue
this road ahead with all of you

00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:26.180
to build the future of
automotive infotainment

00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:28.550
and create a safe and seamless
experience for drivers

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:29.450
everywhere.

00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:32.500
Thanks, and enjoy
the rest of the show.
