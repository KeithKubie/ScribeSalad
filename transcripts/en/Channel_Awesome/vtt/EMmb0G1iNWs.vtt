RACER: Dad!

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.580
(sigh) I don't have time time right now...

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.740
...Rocket?
- No.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.620
- Rebel?
- No.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:42.600
- Racer?
- Yes.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.200
I don't have time right now, Racer!

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.680
I'm writing, directing, editing, shooting, rendering, composing...

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.460
...and providing the catering for Spy Kids 4!

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.460
Do you even have a crew anymore?

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.860
Yeah, he's over there.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:52.820
(typing)

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.220
- Hi Racer.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.820
Now go play with you other siblings who have radical 'R' names.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.740
Racer: But dad, it's my birthday.
- And, that's why I'm...

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.300
- ...making this movie for you.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.180
Huh?

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.980
Really?

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.920
Spy Kids 4 was just a lie to trick ya.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.480
I'm actually making a movie based on all the characters that you've created.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.020
You know the ones I'm talking about.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.000
RACER: Sharkboy and Lavagirl?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.260
Sharkboy and Lavagirl! That's right.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.760
And all the crazy adventures they go on.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.800
Oh, I haven't thought of any adventures for them yet.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.700
What'd you dream last night?

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.560
Oh, mom said I shouldn't dream that anymore-

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.500
What else did you dream last night?

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.260
MILK AND COOKIES!

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.940
The Land of Milk and Cookies is where it takes place!

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.100
And I will give you full credit at the beginning of the film, so everybody knows it was your idea.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.140
Wait. Doesn't that just give you an easy out if the movie's bad?

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.040
I prefer to see it as the greeting card before you open your gift.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.720
D'aww.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.740
Now off you go, Daddy has to get some inspiration.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.600
Oh! Are you gonna play your tiny paper flute?

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.300
What can I say? I just write so much better with it.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.100
Now, off you go.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.140
*inhales*

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.620
- Sharkboy and Lavagirl?

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.000
- Sharkboy and Lavagirl.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.480
NC: In many respects, Robert Rodriguez is a film-maker's film-maker.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:15.580
He started off with no money, but made up for it by incorporating what little he had into a unique and clever style.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.440
He saved on crew by doing most of the work himself: directing, editing, writing, composing, special effects...

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.800
He's cheap, quick, and best of all, cool.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.960
It's pretty hard not to be impressed with the guy.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.740
But not surprisingly, sometimes the fast-paced cheapness can backfire.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.040
Particularly with his children's films.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.900
While the first "Spy Kids" was a big hit with most audiences and critics,

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.520
They seemed to get more and more childish and gimmicky as they went on

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.680
But its not the Spy Kids movies that people remember being the most outlandishly strange and fucked up,

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.360
that distinction goes to The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl!

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.340
This is a film that actually starts off by saying it was inspired by the stories and dreams of one of his kids.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.720
A charming gesture on say, a behind the scenes featurette,

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:05.540
but when you had to put that before your movie, almost like you're trying to already set the curve pretty low,

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.920
well, let's just hope the family enjoys it because for the rest of us...

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.980
Um... let's just hope the family enjoys it.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.700
Let's take a look at Sharkboy and Lavagirl.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.200
*sigh* Okay, filmmakers, as well as the internet in general, word of advice,

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:34.660
If you put quotes around something and then a name after it, it surprisingly doesn't automatically make it important.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.040
You can, do it with anything really.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.240
Not very happy when you really think about it...

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.960
We start with the backstory of Sharkboy as, I have to admit, it's actually kind of funny and creative.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:02.740
(Film) "He was a marine biologist or at least in training but one day an incredible, mysterious storm appeared.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.080
Oh shit, this is just exposition for Sharknado 4. Quick! Hide all your Tara Reids!

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.880
"Sharkboy and his father survived, but they survived on different sides of the wreckage,

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.560
each floating off in a different direction.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.160
Sharkboy was completely alone."

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.360
Yeah, he looks really torn up about it.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.760
[NC] Sharkboy: "Ah, I should've gotten his adult password for Netflix."

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.820
The sharks take him in as one of their own, he grows gills...

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.140
As most growing boys do...

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.580
And he comes across our main character, Max.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.880
Who decides to take him home.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.040
Max: "Then one night, I was visited by a glowing light.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.280
An amazing girl with purple flames for hair and skin of molten lava-rock appeared.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.160
I called her 'Lavagirl'."

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.760
[NC] Lavagirl: Uhh, actually it's Amanda.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:50.880
[NC] Max: "Lavagirl."

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.540
[NC] Lavagirl: Why do you feel like you need to name me?

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:53.500
[NC] Max: "Lavagirl."

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.380
[NC] Lavagirl: Does Rodriguez always name kids after things?

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.520
[NC] Max: "Lavagirl."

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.840
[NC] Lavagirl: Okay, Fine! Lavagirl. Jesus...

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.240
She says she has to take Sharkboy to planet Drool and that's the last he's ever seen of them.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.060
Not surprisingly, everyone doesn't believe his story. Including his teacher, played by George Lopez.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.680
Mr. Electricidad: "How many people think Max's story is true?"

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:12.660
"Have a seat, Max."

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.560
[NC] Mr. Lopez: "I have five failed sitcoms to get to."

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.980
But a bunch of Disney Channel villains try to take his dream journal.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.200
You know, that device that every kid in movies has but you never actually met somebody who has one.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.320
And Max tries to run away.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:25.940
Linus: "Get the book!"

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:32.780
*Chuckle* Oh My God, this kid is so confident in his master evilry, he just has to point and his minions understand?

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.400
In fact, why the hell does he even have minions?
HE'S FUCKING EIGHT!

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.760
Linus: "I'll bring you a revised edition tomorrow."

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.180
And don't worry, I'm sure it'll be better than what this story is turning out so far.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.980
But Max finds out more and more how few people actually believe him.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:52.360
Max: "It was Sharkboy and Lavagirl! Look, this one has shark bites, and this one is singed! Ooh!"

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.060
Mom: "There's no such thing as Sharkboy and Lavagirl."

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:56.920
Dad: "Well, I believe him..."

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:03.860
But I also my believe my penis is my eleventh toe, so I might not be the best person to ask.

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.060
Max: "Stupid plugs..."

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.200
"Please don't let me have to go to school.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.020
They'll make fun of me, I know it..."

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.000
[NC] Max: "Please, top-bunk which, seeing how I have no other siblings, I'm not sure why is here."

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.260
Seriously, who's up there? Tom Hanks from 'Big'?

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.280
Max: "Linus took my journal!"

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.760
Mr. Lopez: "Give Max back his journal."

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.460
After the teacher forces Linus to give back Max's dream journal,

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:29.000
Max sees that it's ruined, leading to one of my favorite deliveries from Linus.

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.580
Max: "HE RUINED MY  D  R  E  A  M   J  O  U  R  N  A  L!"

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:37.020
Linus: "I did not! Mr. Electric, send him to the principal's office AND HAVE HIM  E  X  P  E  L  L  E  D  ! "

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:42.020
(Chuckle) Okay, this kid's training to be a Spider-Man villain. I mean who talks this way?

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.680
Linus: "...send him to the principal's office AND HAVE HIM  E  X  P  E  L  L  E D  ! "

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.320
"Then, it'll be MY turn to look after Mr. Fluffy the Hamster for the school weekend!"

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.560
(Dramatic Thunder) MWAH-HAHAHAHAHA!

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:57.020
But Mr. Lopez says "Hey, I can act even fucking sillier than that!"

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.680
Mr. Lopez: "I know everything! And you...

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.420
Know nothing!"

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.300
"At the end of class, BOTH of you report to the principal's office.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.000
With your parents!"

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.800
Somebody. Give me direction as I, Have no idea, What I, am doing.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:13.820
With your parents.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.600
But suddenly, Sharkboy and Lavagirl bust in.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:23.380
Sharkboy: "If you wanna stop the Darkness from destroying our worlds... Come with us."

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.820
Mr. Lopez: "You better go with 'em."

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.360
Jesus, is this guy trying to get worst teacher of the year?

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.140
"Go with the two strangers towards the killer tornado,

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.860
I'm just going to stay here and teach everybody how they'll never need geometry."

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:39.640
Max: "I can't believe I'm finally getting to ditch this place and go to Planet Drool!"

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:44.260
By the way, that's Taylor Dooley as Lavagirl and guess who as Sharkboy.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.780
Having trouble?

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.460
Well, just imagine him with his shirt off...

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:52.820
That's right! That little kid is Jacob from Twilight.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:54.900
By God...

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.180
I'd never thought I would need it again but...

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.480
the time has come.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:08.720
♫ Church Choir ♫

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.220
(Explosion)

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.060
♫ Church Choir reaches crescendo♫

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.280
I thought I put you away forever,

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.000
But you are needed once more.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.140
You will be most useful, my friend.

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:27.060
*kiss*

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:33.560
They get aboard a shark spaceship and get ready to launch.

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:37.260
Lavagirl: "Blue goggles for the boys, pink for the girls."

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.140
Max: "Do you have another pair of boy goggles?"

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:40.640
Sharkboy: "Nuh-huh."

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.120
Then why would you say pink is for girls?

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.420
And why is there only one pair of boy goggles?

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:48.580
And why would you have that selection to begin wi- This mission's already bullshit!

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.020
(Rocket Launch Noises)

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:56.500
They take off to Planet Drool but, is it me or do they look more like they landed on Planet Food Fight?

00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:00.920
Oh boy, I do hope there's a stereotypes and sex innuendo part of the planet!

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.800
Lavagirl: "Recognize your dream world, Max?

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.720
Max: "Not really."

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.180
Jesus, it's like somebody melted the Teletubbies.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.360
Which I would like this movie a lot more if that was the story,

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.400
But nope, this is where all of Max's dreams go,

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.120
and is being taken over by something called 'The Darkness'.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.840
Sharkboy: "The Darkness! Run!"

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:17.920
(Metal groaning)

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.860
And if you think this is the closest thing to mocking The Neverending Story,,

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:23.440
remember, The Neverending Story did it pretty well on its own.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.640
*Kids screaming*

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.480
Lavagirl: "Kids aren't allowed to rest, 'cause if they rest, they sleep.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.480
and if they dream-”
Sharkboy: “It takes away power from Mr. Electric.”

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.080
(Rocketing Jump Sounds?)

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.820
[NC] Max: "Hey, come on, I can't green-screen like you can!"

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.720
So they try to save some kids from a roller coaster that won't stop and...

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:50.020
You know what, I just figured out why this movie looks more gimmicky than it does creative.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:55.640
The whole thing, I mean the whole thing looks like one giant, extreme 90's commercial.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.200
Think about it, can't you see it advertising something?

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.100
90's Malcolm: "Woah!

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.420
Ride the roller-coaster of flavor with Capri Sun!

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.200
90's Tamara: "Hey! Ever ridden a

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.340
EXTREME JELLY BEAN!?

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:08.880
Well, now you can with Ext-Relly Belly!"

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:13.000
90's Malcolm: "Hey! Ever go through a door that looks like a penis and testicles?"

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:19.040
90's Tamara: I... I completely forgot what we were selling.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:24.540
So they come across one of the villains named Mr. Electric, played again by George Lopez.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.420
Mr. Electric: "No school, no discipline, no rules,

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:30.100
and most important, no dreams!"

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:32.940
(Power plugs hissing)

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.100
(Cartoon Punch Sounds)

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:37.740
(Chuckle) Now that's the face of an invested hero.

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:39.760
[NC] Lavagirl: "I'm flying, who cares..."

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.540
Mr. Electric: ('Evil' Laugh)

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.620
[NC]: I'm Mr. Possession Head with my bucket of Hell!

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.660
Hey-ey, this looks like fun! Where do I put the quarter in?

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:53.580
What. I can't play it?

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:57.400
I just assumed this was all a cutscene for a McDonalds online game or something.

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.560
You mean we're supposed to take this story seriously?

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.420
I was just watching to get an Egg McMuffin coupon at the end.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:08.280
So he captures them and sends them on their way to the Graveyard of Dreams where...

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:08.780
Sharkboy: "Duck!"

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.400
(Duck Calls)

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.780
(Sigh) Did I mention this was in 3D?

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.180
You know, sometimes that can be a good thing, like,

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:20.040
flying through the skies in 'How to Train Your Dragon',

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.780
Or experiencing breathtaking worlds in 'Avatar'.

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:26.900
But then every once in a while you get the Youtube Poop of 3D.

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:28.520
Where every so often they just go:

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.760
FUCK YOU WE'RE 3D! FUCK YOU WE'RE 3D!

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.800
Can you see this in 3D! Can you see this in 3D!?

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.080
You fucking little dick whores!

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:35.580
*Smack*

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:37.540
Lavagirl: "Close your eyes and dream.

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:41.140
If Max can't remember his dreams, maybe he can re-dream them."

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:42.780
Sharkboy: "He can dream us out of here."

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.140
Lavagirl: "Dream, Max."

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:50.540
I would love you if you never do that smile again.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:54.740
Lavagirl: "I know you got a lot to figure out, but if you happen to dream about

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:57.600
who I am, and how I fit into this world..."

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:01.560
Please dream up a plot for me, the writers forgot to give me one.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:06.340
They come across a robot that Max dreamed up and hope will have some answers.

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.080
Max: "Tobor, awake!"

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:10.800
Tobor: "Yes?"

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.760
Max: "We can ask him anything now."

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:13.900
Lavagirl: "Let me, Let me!

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.920
Tell me something about me.

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:17.340
I'm clueless."

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.340
Bernard: Your joke, sir.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.000
NC: Oh, thank you so much, Bernard.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.120
Ah, look at that, silver platter and everything,

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.360
you've made it impossible for me to ignore this.

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:29.860
Bernard: My pleasure, sir.

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:32.020
NC: *Ahem*

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:35.680
NOT AS CLUELESS AS YOUR AGENT!

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.920
HAHAHAHAHA! AH-HAHAHAHA

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.100
IN FUCKING 3D! FUCKING 3D!

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:41.880
Bernard.

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:47.780
FUCKING 3D! FUCKING 3D!

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:51.240
So the robot tells them to go to the Land of Milk and Cookies,

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.880
which, I think this the Holy Land from Moses, Jr.,

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.700
where they come across the Train of Thought.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:59.620
Max: "That's the Train of Thought? How do I keep it on track?"

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:02.140
Well if we knew that, we'd be in a much better movie wouldn't we.

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:05.000
Max: "Sorry I forgot about you, Tobor."

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.260
Tobor: "Are you kidding? You just saved me.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.640
I'm freeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!"

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:14.400
God, even the magical robot sounds disinterested!

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.680
Tobor: "...I'm freeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!"

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.820
[NC] Tobor: "I'm going to go visit my children."

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.720
"Look kids, I'm home."

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.160
Tobor's Kids: Yaaaaaaaaaay.

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:33.160
♫ Commercial Break ♫

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:43.160
♫ Now back to: Nostalgia Critic ♫

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.600
So while they fly by all the brains this movie killed,

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.180
they realized that the locomotive is out of control.

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:50.260
(Lever pull)

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:51.300
(Door Opening)

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.620
Lavagirl : "Jump! It'll be all right!"

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:57.880
Annnd that was the end of Lavagirl! We never knew that much about her but we never wanted to anyway.

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:03.440
And that was the end of Sharkboy, at least he won't imprint on any newborn babies anytime soon.

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.020
Can we go now?

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:05.980
(Squish)

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.600
They end up in literally a half-baked Mario Kart level,

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.100
but it looks like they're not out of the woods yet.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.180
Look out! The film's just given up!

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:20.440
(Stomping)

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:23.160
Okay, so the parents are in this dream too.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:27.460
Well, good, this could give some very visual insight into Max's feelings towards them.

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:30.200
Max: "Those giants almost look like my parents"

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.780
Lavagirl: "They seem happy together. Is that your dream?"

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:36.340
Max: "We had a dream we're a family. It hasn't been coming true lately."

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:38.560
Lavagirl: "Most dreams don't come true on their own,

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.600
You have to make them true.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.680
Takes a lot of work.

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:44.420
Not easy."

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:50.660
*Sigh* Okay, wow. I never thought I would have to say this in a Robert Rodriguez movie but...

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.500
Show. Don't. Tell.

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:59.320
That's the idea of film. In 'Where The Wild Things Are', the monsters represent the boy's insecurities.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:04.540
Even in 'Bridge to Terabithia', the shadow catching up to our lead shows us his fear of confronting death.

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:07.700
Here, the parents attack him for no reason, and leave!

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:10.360
They have no character, they don't even have any lines,

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:13.800
and everything that's said here could just be said in the real world!

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:18.960
So this sequence was practically pointless. In a visual medium like this, we gain nothing!

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:23.440
How would you like it if in 'The Wizard of Oz' the characters just explained, rather than expressed?

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:28.360
Wicked Witch of the West: "...and as for you, my fine lady, it's true, I can't attend to you here and now as I'd like,

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.960
but just try to stay out of my way."

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:35.640
[NC] Glinda: Well, she certainly seems like a representation of abandonment issues you're feeling for Toto.

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:41.260
As well as your feels of limited mortality not allowing you to see as much of the world as your short time-span allows.

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:45.600
(Stunned Silence)

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:50.760
So they tell Max that he needs to dream in order to stop the land from being consumed by The Darkness.

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:55.080
Sharkboy: "Alright Max, you've had your cookies and milk. Now go to sleep."

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:57.840
Yeah, we filled you up with sugar little boy. Now sleep!

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:02.460

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:45.460
What?

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:49.620
But Mr. Electric starts to approach and they need to wake him up.

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:51.160
Mr. Electric: "...power!"

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:55.940

Oh, I've missed you!

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.960
Lavagirl: "Hot lava..."

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:14.660
NC: What the hell?

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:15.900
Max: "Where's Lavagirl?"

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:17.800

NC: WHAT THE HELL!?

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:31.540
You know, General Patton used to say you'll gain strength when you look into a pile of goo that's a best friend's face.

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:36.220
Well, I'm looking into a pile of goo that's a best friend's face, and I'm scared fucking shitless of it!

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:38.780
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS MOVIE?!

NC: Yeah, I would've loved to have seen the direction on that one.

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:04.980
Just act like you don't know what you're supposed to be doing and nobody is helping you at all.

Oh yeah, visual dead air.

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:13.940
They tell Max that apparently he's getting better at mastering the next stage: daydreaming.

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:20.840
Lavagirl: "This is great, Max. You're starting to daydream. Keep that up, and they'll never get us."

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:25.180
NC: Much like the audience, pay no attention to what's going on and imagine something better.

Check the bottom of the ocean."

NC: I'm not gonna lie, I think this kid has been waiting all his life to play this part.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.280
I mean, just watch him in this performance.

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:20.560
I'm just trying to imagine this obvious James Bond villain trying to cope in a 4th grade environment.

But fear exists in the one place you can never escape!

[NC] Minus: Oh, yes. You may think you have won at Guess Who, but let me ask you this.

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:38.220
Does your person have brown hair?

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:40.720
Robert!

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:03.200

♫ Narwhals by Weebl plays ♫

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:09.080
To be fair, I'd go nuts if I had to hear that song again, too.

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:14.260
So they get back the Dream Journal and Sharkboy is able to find out what happened to his father.

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:17.600
Max: "Your father really is at the bottom of the ocean.

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.880
He's in a submarine. Looking for you!"

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:29.340
NC: Okay, for the record... Dick delivery, all right?

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:31.420
[NC] Max: "It says here that he crashed.

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.620
On the bed because he was so tired.

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.560
But then apparently he died!

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:38.280
Of exhaustion because he's working so hard.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:43.020
But then a squid ripped off his head, ate his body, and has been digesting it for weeks!

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:48.000
Is what he would call his memoirs if a squid ripped off his head, ate his body, and has been digest-

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.140
Sharkboy: *Loud scream*

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:51.500
[NC] Max: "I'm sorry, I focus on weird details."

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:54.860
NC: So they go back to the ice castle to see the Princess of Ice.

00:20:54.900 --> 00:21:02.260
♪ [NC] Let it blow, let it blow, at least I don't have penis hair! ♪

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:07.380
She gives him the crystal heart to help them on their mission, but Mr. Electric shocks Sharkboy unconscious.

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:11.640
So Lavagirl has to go save him, even though the water will kill her in the process.

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:14.740
Max: "Come on, Sharkboy!"

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:19.380
[NC] Lavagirl: "My last request is to put a bullshit quote for me at the beginning of the film."

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:25.140
NC: But Creepy-as-Shit Face comes back and tells them that she needs to be thrown into the volcano to save her.

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:27.940
Sharkboy: I'll go. I'm stronger and faster.

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:36.280
[NC] Sharkboy: "Hey, at least you're unconscious. I've had to carry a girl just to make some cougar's horny fantasy come to life."

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:36.860
(Closing book)

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:40.160
NC: I think that's enough for now. But you will be missed, old friend.

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:41.140
*kiss*

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:49.240
(Lava bubbling)

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.240
Sharkboy: *Grunt*

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:54.040
[NC] Sharkboy: Oh, my God, that killed her! I don't know why I thought that would work! I'm a terrible person!

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:59.300
NC: It, of course, brings her back to life.

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:03.000
Which is good, as a healthy dose of scenery seems to be next on the menu.

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:06.260
Minus: (swishes cape dramatically) "How'd you get in here?"

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:07.300
NC: *Bursts out laughing*

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:10.960
Minus: "I hate to burst your bubble, Dreamboy, but I read your book."

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:15.020
[NC] Minus: "Hate to burst your bubble, but the marbles on my side of the Hungry, Hungry Hippos

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:17.640
are more than the marbles on your side of the Hungry, Hungry Hippos."

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:24.240
NC: "So it's a showdown between Linus' nightmares and Max's pussy dreams."

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.860
Max: "Brainstorm!"

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:34.160
What was that supposed to stick to?

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:37.900
Max: "Brain...

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:39.300
F  A  R  T  !  "

00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:58.720
(Phone beeps)

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:03.440
(Phone ringing)

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:04.620
Past!NC : Hello?

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:07.500
NC: Hi, this is you twenty minutes from now, umm...

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:09.140
you need to get out.

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:11.360
Past!NC: What are you talking about? It's just Sharkboy and Lavagirl.

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:15.820
NC: No, you don't understand! You will not be able to SLEEP!

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:17.420
For a year!

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:21.280
Past!NC: Come on, I survived Son of the Mask; and Foodfight!. Those had a ton of scary scenes in it.

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:24.580
What it lacks in quantity it makes up for in magnitude!

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:28.980
Past!NC: Look, if you're there, obviously I did it. I'm... not even sure how we're really doing this right now.

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:34.920
NC: Okay, okay, but I want you to write "I'm sorry" on a piece of paper and stick it under the desk.

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:36.020
Past!NC: Why?

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:38.620
NC: BECAUSE I DESERVE AN APOLOGY FROM SOMEONE!

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:48.380
*NC cries as melancholy music plays*

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:51.600
NC: So after... Oh, God... fucking that scene,

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.760
Sharkboy defeats Mr. Electric.

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.440
Mr. Electric: *Struggling grunts*

00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:01.580
[NC] Mr. Electric "Wait, I'm electricity in water. Shouldn't this kill you? I really am a bad teacher."

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:06.900
NC: Meanwhile, Linus, really with the most minimal effort, is convinced to be good again.

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:08.880
No, really, this is all it took.

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:11.800
Max: "We can create a better dream than this.

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.560
A better world.

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:14.880
What do you say?"

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:20.180
NC: God, I wish all villains were this easy to win over.

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:23.860
Darth Vader: If you only knew the power of the Dark Side-

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:24.600
NC: Hey, knock it off!

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.120
[NC] Darth Vader: Oh, okay.

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:27.780
NC: Lets get some clippertinis.

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:28.700
[NC] Darth Vader: Sure.

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:38.120
Sharkboy: I am King of the Ocean.

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.000
Lavagirl: "Thanks for saving me."

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:47.160
NC: Well, technically, you saved him first, but fuck it, the chick saving the dude never counts in movies.

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:50.460
Minus: "Everything will return to being the way it was.

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:53.380
You will be able to travel to Earth and back again as you wish.

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:55.100
You can search for your father.

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:57.220
You can rule Earth's lava world."

00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:00.320
NC: Oh, he's such a bad actor when he's not evil.

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:02.720
I mean, a less fun kind of bad.

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.180
*Mr. Electric blasts off*

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:05.480
Sharkboy: "He's headed to Earth!"

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:08.940
Minus: "He's going to try and destroy you in your sleep."

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.300
NC: Oh, my God, go back to waving your cape or something!

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:12.780
Just keep your head the same size!

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:18.560
When he gets back to Earth, he finds it's still under a tornado attack and this time, it's caused by Mr. Electric.

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:21.540
On top of that, Max's parents get dragged in, too.

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.740
Mom: "Find Max! Tell him I love him!"

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:26.440
Dad: "Don't leave me!"

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.500
Mom: "I thought you wanted me to leave!"

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:32.560
Dad: "No, I don't! You're my best friend!"

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:37.780
NC: Wow, this is the most disinterested couple getting sucked into a tornado ever.

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:39.620
Mom: "Ahhhhhhhhhhhh."

00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:41.820
NC: Even her scream kinda sounds half-assed.

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:45.640
Mom: "Ahhhhhhh-" [NC] Don't forget to take out the garbage... "

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:53.460
But Lavagirl saves her as Max figures out that the teacher's daughter, being the only one who believed Max to begin with, is the only one to stop the evil.

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:56.440
Max: "Do you know what to do?"
Marissa: "I believe so."

00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:00.500
[NC] Marissa: "I'm gonna do what I always dreamed: kill my dad."

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:05.880
NC: She saves the day as everything seems okay now.

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:08.480
In fact, a little too okay.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:14.960
Max: "So dream a better dream. Then work to make it real."

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:20.780
NC: So remember, kids: if your parents are getting a divorce, just dream really, really, REALLY hard,

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:24.840
and eventually, they'll get back together. It always works.

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:33.840
And that was Sharkboy and Lavagirl, a nice gift from a good father, but a LOUSY movie from a great director.

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:42.080
I'll give it credit for some of its creativity, and again, it's kind of hard to be angry at someone who basically made this movie for his kids.

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:47.640
But the cheapness of the story and the effects don't work to the film's advantage like his other works.

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:51.520
In Sin City, the cheapness is stylized and gives a unique look.

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:56.580
In this, the cheapness is too similar to so many other bad films that obviously didn't try.

00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:59.520
So this just looks like another one of those bad films.

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:05.180
Aside from one or two entertaining performances, most of the acting is really wooden or just flat out awkward.

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:08.160
A noble idea, but sadly, a failed delivery.

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.140
So Racer? What do you think of your birthday gift?

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:17.240
I got you a car too.

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.840
Racer: *Gasp* Yeah! Woo!

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.320
-Ungrateful little shit...

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:25.860
*Inhales*

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:27.740
*Exhales*

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:33.020
♫ Ending Credit Theme ♫

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:52.800
Linus: Send him to the principals office and HAVE HIM EXPELLED!

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:56.840
Lavagirl: "We believe in you, Max!"
