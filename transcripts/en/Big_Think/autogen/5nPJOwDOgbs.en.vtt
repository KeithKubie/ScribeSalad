I don't know kind of how it happens but

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:12.730
I don't know kind of how it happens but
 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.340
I don't know kind of how it happens but
I think fundamentally it's all about

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:15.350
I think fundamentally it's all about
 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.140
I think fundamentally it's all about
venture capital the more money that's

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150
venture capital the more money that's
 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.790
venture capital the more money that's
available and the more sort of the

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800
available and the more sort of the
 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.589
available and the more sort of the
culture is about going out and raising

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:23.599
culture is about going out and raising
 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:25.420
culture is about going out and raising
money and the more it just happens and

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430
money and the more it just happens and
 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.639
money and the more it just happens and
it sort of feeds on itself if the

00:00:27.639 --> 00:00:27.649
it sort of feeds on itself if the
 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:29.109
it sort of feeds on itself if the
venture capitalist weren't there there'd

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119
venture capitalist weren't there there'd
 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:30.429
venture capitalist weren't there there'd
be a lot of empty companies that

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439
be a lot of empty companies that
 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:32.380
be a lot of empty companies that
wouldn't be there in that pod that I

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390
wouldn't be there in that pod that I
 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.330
wouldn't be there in that pod that I
think probably be better not in every

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340
think probably be better not in every
 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.250
think probably be better not in every
case but in most cases I think it's

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260
case but in most cases I think it's
 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.200
case but in most cases I think it's
better when your forces an entrepreneur

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210
better when your forces an entrepreneur
 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.150
better when your forces an entrepreneur
to bootstrap and here's the fundamental

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160
to bootstrap and here's the fundamental
 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.880
to bootstrap and here's the fundamental
reason why if you have two companies one

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890
reason why if you have two companies one
 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.259
reason why if you have two companies one
that's bootstraps one that's you know

00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:44.269
that's bootstraps one that's you know
 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:46.360
that's bootstraps one that's you know
self-funded one that's got venture

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370
self-funded one that's got venture
 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.549
self-funded one that's got venture
capital money in the bank the primary

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559
capital money in the bank the primary
 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.349
capital money in the bank the primary
difference is this on day one a

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:50.359
difference is this on day one a
 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:53.069
difference is this on day one a
bootstrap company has to make money on

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079
bootstrap company has to make money on
 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.200

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210
day one a funded company has to spend
 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.880
day one a funded company has to spend
money they have like money in the bank

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890
money they have like money in the bank
 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.979
money they have like money in the bank
to spend that's their first task is to

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989
to spend that's their first task is to
 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.889
to spend that's their first task is to
spend to hire to get a great beautiful

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899
spend to hire to get a great beautiful
 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:04.420
spend to hire to get a great beautiful
beautiful office to do all that stuff

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430
beautiful office to do all that stuff
 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.770
beautiful office to do all that stuff
that's what they have to do that to

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780
that's what they have to do that to
 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.870
that's what they have to do that to
spend money unlike a bootstrap company

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880
spend money unlike a bootstrap company
 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.100
spend money unlike a bootstrap company
that doesn't have my tits but I have to

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110
that doesn't have my tits but I have to
 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.630
that doesn't have my tits but I have to
make money first and I think that's the

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640
make money first and I think that's the
 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.730
make money first and I think that's the
right instinct for an entrepreneur to

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740
right instinct for an entrepreneur to
 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.950
right instinct for an entrepreneur to
start out with is the idea of I gotta

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960
start out with is the idea of I gotta
 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.600
start out with is the idea of I gotta
make money that's the right that's the

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610
make money that's the right that's the
 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.070
make money that's the right that's the
right thing and I think what happens is

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080
right thing and I think what happens is
 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.480
right thing and I think what happens is
especially in Silicon Valley where

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490
especially in Silicon Valley where
 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:20.740
especially in Silicon Valley where
there's a lot of spare money around

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750
there's a lot of spare money around
 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.550
there's a lot of spare money around
people are handing it out essentially

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560
people are handing it out essentially
 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.530
people are handing it out essentially
that you don't have the instinct the

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540
that you don't have the instinct the
 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.210
that you don't have the instinct the
instinct isn't built to make money the

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220
instinct isn't built to make money the
 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.770
instinct isn't built to make money the
instinct is built to spend money any of

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780
instinct is built to spend money any of
 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.360
instinct is built to spend money any of
that just kind of perpetuates itself and

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370
that just kind of perpetuates itself and
 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.010
that just kind of perpetuates itself and
people don't have to make money because

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020
people don't have to make money because
 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.780
people don't have to make money because
other people are paying for things until

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790
other people are paying for things until
 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:35.950
other people are paying for things until
the money runs out and then you're kind

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960
the money runs out and then you're kind
 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:36.850
the money runs out and then you're kind
of screwed then it's too late because

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860
of screwed then it's too late because
 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.080
of screwed then it's too late because
you don't have the skills to make money

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090
you don't have the skills to make money
 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.540
you don't have the skills to make money
so that's I think the problem with

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550
so that's I think the problem with
 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.240
so that's I think the problem with
Silicon Valley

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250
 
 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.840
 
well I think the thing is is that not

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850
well I think the thing is is that not
 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.580
well I think the thing is is that not
having money or having to make your own

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590
having money or having to make your own
 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.260
having money or having to make your own
forces you to make really smart

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270
forces you to make really smart
 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.690
forces you to make really smart
decisions and good decisions and makes

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700
decisions and good decisions and makes
 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.580
decisions and good decisions and makes
you think about stuff like for example

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590
you think about stuff like for example
 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.170
you think about stuff like for example
you know if you go out and what if you

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180
you know if you go out and what if you
 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.030
you know if you go out and what if you
win the lottery you're probably going to

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040
win the lottery you're probably going to
 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.020
win the lottery you're probably going to
make good decisions about how to spend

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030
make good decisions about how to spend
 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.550
make good decisions about how to spend
your money you've got a lot of it so you

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560
your money you've got a lot of it so you
 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.469
your money you've got a lot of it so you
just now buy a house I'll buy a boat

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479
just now buy a house I'll buy a boat
 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.520
just now buy a house I'll buy a boat
I'll buy this stuff like you're not

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530
I'll buy this stuff like you're not
 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.810
I'll buy this stuff like you're not
actually making decisions you're just

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820
actually making decisions you're just
 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.250
actually making decisions you're just
spending money but when you have very

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260
spending money but when you have very
 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.840
spending money but when you have very
limited resources you're forcing the

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850
limited resources you're forcing the
 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.330
limited resources you're forcing the
making decisions that makes sense does

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340
making decisions that makes sense does
 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.070
making decisions that makes sense does
it make sense for us to spend this money

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080
it make sense for us to spend this money
 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.510
it make sense for us to spend this money
on marketing we have it should we just

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520
on marketing we have it should we just
 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.610
on marketing we have it should we just
blow it or are we not gonna get a return

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620
blow it or are we not gonna get a return
 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.800
blow it or are we not gonna get a return
on it and you start to think about these

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810
on it and you start to think about these
 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.240
on it and you start to think about these
things and you start to find yourself

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250
things and you start to find yourself
 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.890
things and you start to find yourself
wondering like does it make sense to

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900
wondering like does it make sense to
 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.560
wondering like does it make sense to
hire 20 people or should we hire two we

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570
hire 20 people or should we hire two we
 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.330
hire 20 people or should we hire two we
can afford to hire two so let's hire to

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340
can afford to hire two so let's hire to
 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.460
can afford to hire two so let's hire to
really good people because that's all we

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470
really good people because that's all we
 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.410
really good people because that's all we
can do and when you're forced to like

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420
can do and when you're forced to like
 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.940
can do and when you're forced to like
forcing those constraints you just make

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950
forcing those constraints you just make
 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.800
forcing those constraints you just make
better decisions I always look at this

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810
better decisions I always look at this
 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.050
better decisions I always look at this
is probably weird analogy but I tend to

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060
is probably weird analogy but I tend to
 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.660
is probably weird analogy but I tend to
look at prisoners in jail how they make

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670
look at prisoners in jail how they make
 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.910
look at prisoners in jail how they make
these weapons or they'll take like a pen

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920
these weapons or they'll take like a pen
 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.970
these weapons or they'll take like a pen
and like a piece of tape and in a comb

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980
and like a piece of tape and in a comb
 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.530
and like a piece of tape and in a comb
and they make they can like break out of

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540
and they make they can like break out of
 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.020
and they make they can like break out of
prison with that but if someone had all

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030
prison with that but if someone had all
 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.070
prison with that but if someone had all
the money in the world to break out of

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080
the money in the world to break out of
 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.150
the money in the world to break out of
prison and they would like buy a

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160
prison and they would like buy a
 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.100
prison and they would like buy a
jackhammer and they would buy like you

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110
jackhammer and they would buy like you
 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.720
jackhammer and they would buy like you
know chisels and stuff they'd make too

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730
know chisels and stuff they'd make too
 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.789
know chisels and stuff they'd make too
much noise they attract too much

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799
much noise they attract too much
 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.530
much noise they attract too much
attention and it wouldn't work they have

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540
attention and it wouldn't work they have
 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.090
attention and it wouldn't work they have
all the resources but they'd spend them

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100
all the resources but they'd spend them
 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.190
all the resources but they'd spend them
they wouldn't spend them wisely but the

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200
they wouldn't spend them wisely but the
 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.870
they wouldn't spend them wisely but the
person who has no resources has to make

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880
person who has no resources has to make
 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.340
person who has no resources has to make
something that's very very very simple

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350
something that's very very very simple
 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.800
something that's very very very simple
and just as effective and that's sort of

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810
and just as effective and that's sort of
 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.360
and just as effective and that's sort of
the mentality I think that you see in

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370
the mentality I think that you see in
 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.920
the mentality I think that you see in
bootstrap companies like we don't have

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930
bootstrap companies like we don't have
 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.030
bootstrap companies like we don't have
the resources we've got to make

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040
the resources we've got to make
 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.259
the resources we've got to make
something that makes sense and we only

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269
something that makes sense and we only
 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:13.819
something that makes sense and we only
really have one shot at it so we're

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829
really have one shot at it so we're
 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.380
really have one shot at it so we're
going to do a good job and just do

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390
going to do a good job and just do
 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.880
going to do a good job and just do
exactly what we need and not all the

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890
exactly what we need and not all the
 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.880
exactly what we need and not all the
things that we could do

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890
 
 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.590
 
I think we probably hired a lot of

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600
I think we probably hired a lot of
 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.780
I think we probably hired a lot of
people if we had a lot of money that's

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790
people if we had a lot of money that's
 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.640
people if we had a lot of money that's
just something you tended to do in the

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650
just something you tended to do in the
 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.280
just something you tended to do in the

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.260
late 90s I heard so many companies so
we're going to staff up that is the

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270
we're going to staff up that is the
 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.330
we're going to staff up that is the
stupidest thing to say staff up

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340
stupidest thing to say staff up
 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.860
stupidest thing to say staff up
we're going to stat how about we're

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870
we're going to stat how about we're
 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.570
we're going to stat how about we're
going to hire somebody that we need what

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580
going to hire somebody that we need what
 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.040

is this idea of staffing up there was

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050
is this idea of staffing up there was
 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.600
is this idea of staffing up there was
this there's this thing going on the 90s

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610
this there's this thing going on the 90s
 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:40.920
this there's this thing going on the 90s
I remember people saying like we're

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930
I remember people saying like we're
 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.199
I remember people saying like we're
going to staff up to a hundred or people

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209
going to staff up to a hundred or people
 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:44.940

they're talking about this big they're
 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.330
they're talking about this big they're
talking about employees and it is very

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340
talking about employees and it is very
 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.860
talking about employees and it is very
easy it carried away with that and

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870
easy it carried away with that and
 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.110
easy it carried away with that and
thinking like that your inferior unless

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120
thinking like that your inferior unless
 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.030
thinking like that your inferior unless
you have a lot of employees so I think

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040
you have a lot of employees so I think
 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.350
you have a lot of employees so I think
that's something we probably done we

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360
that's something we probably done we
 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.640
that's something we probably done we
probably put money into marketing that

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650
probably put money into marketing that
 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:57.600
probably put money into marketing that
would have been wasting money we

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610
would have been wasting money we
 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.220
would have been wasting money we
probably put a ton of money at a PR that

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230
probably put a ton of money at a PR that
 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.050
probably put a ton of money at a PR that
would have been a waste of money and it

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060
would have been a waste of money and it
 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.460
would have been a waste of money and it
wouldn't have forced us to be creative

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470
wouldn't have forced us to be creative

about how to get the word out which is

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790
about how to get the word out which is
 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.699
about how to get the word out which is
something we've learned how to do over

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709
something we've learned how to do over
 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.050
something we've learned how to do over
the past ten years without having to

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060
the past ten years without having to
 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.710
the past ten years without having to
spend money so we would have bought some

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720
spend money so we would have bought some
 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.910
spend money so we would have bought some
stuff and maybe done some things but i

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920
stuff and maybe done some things but i
 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.229
stuff and maybe done some things but i
think the real thing is we would have

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239
think the real thing is we would have
 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.470
think the real thing is we would have
missed learning the important lessons

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480
missed learning the important lessons
 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.430
missed learning the important lessons
that's what i think we would have

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440
that's what i think we would have
 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.159
that's what i think we would have
suffered most over

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169
 
 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.420
 
well my feeling is that like the stuff

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430
well my feeling is that like the stuff
 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.709
well my feeling is that like the stuff
that I like to talk about is really

00:04:25.709 --> 00:04:25.719
that I like to talk about is really
 

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:29.129
that I like to talk about is really
about my business my industry so I'm not

software business which is the business

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:43.539
software business which is the business

the business a lot of people are in
outside of the technology world where

00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:48.159
outside of the technology world where
 

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:50.100
outside of the technology world where
you don't have you don't have a factory

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110
you don't have you don't have a factory
 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.050
you don't have you don't have a factory
you don't have to have raw materials so

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060
you don't have to have raw materials so
 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.490
you don't have to have raw materials so
you don't damage any you don't have

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500
you don't damage any you don't have
 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.010
you don't damage any you don't have
these upfront costs that would typically

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020
these upfront costs that would typically
 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.920
these upfront costs that would typically
require you to raise capital if you

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930
require you to raise capital if you
 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.149
require you to raise capital if you
don't have those costs then you

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:00.159
don't have those costs then you
 

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:03.149
don't have those costs then you
shouldn't get the money that you might

00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:03.159
shouldn't get the money that you might
 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:05.490
shouldn't get the money that you might
need to spend to buy those things in the

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500
need to spend to buy those things in the
 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.170
need to spend to buy those things in the
software business you need a computer in

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180
software business you need a computer in
 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.850
software business you need a computer in
an internet connection it's like you

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860
an internet connection it's like you
 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.399
an internet connection it's like you
know a couple grand to get started it

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:11.409
know a couple grand to get started it
 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:12.779
know a couple grand to get started it
but if I'm building a factory and I'm

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:12.789
but if I'm building a factory and I'm
 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:14.309
but if I'm building a factory and I'm
making widgets I might need to you know

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:14.319
making widgets I might need to you know
 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:16.230
making widgets I might need to you know
raise hundreds of thousands or a few

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240
raise hundreds of thousands or a few
 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.550
raise hundreds of thousands or a few
million bucks to make that big capital

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560
million bucks to make that big capital
 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.080
million bucks to make that big capital
expenditure so I think if you don't have

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090
expenditure so I think if you don't have
 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.480
expenditure so I think if you don't have
the raw capital expenditure requirements

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490
the raw capital expenditure requirements
 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.040
the raw capital expenditure requirements
then you should not be raising money up

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050
then you should not be raising money up
 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.289
then you should not be raising money up
front
