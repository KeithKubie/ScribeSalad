00:00:00.176 --> 00:00:01.626
- [Sal] We're now
going to talk about one of

00:00:01.626 --> 00:00:04.297
the most significant figures
in all of human history,

00:00:04.297 --> 00:00:07.471
and that is Siddhartha Gautama,
who would later be known

00:00:07.471 --> 00:00:10.741
as Buddha, as the awakened
one, or the enlightened one.

00:00:10.741 --> 00:00:12.948
Now before we get into his life,

00:00:12.948 --> 00:00:15.864
let's think about the
context in which he was born.

00:00:15.864 --> 00:00:18.342
So we see from this timeline,
most accounts place his

00:00:18.342 --> 00:00:21.763
birth at around 563 BCE,
although there are some

00:00:21.763 --> 00:00:24.641
historians who think that he
might have been born about

00:00:24.641 --> 00:00:27.445
100, 150 years later than that.

00:00:27.445 --> 00:00:29.542
But either way, that
would've been near the end of

00:00:29.542 --> 00:00:31.080
the Vedic Period.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.602
And the Vedic Period is
named after the Vedas,

00:00:33.602 --> 00:00:37.867
these Hindu scriptures
written by those Indo-Aryans

00:00:37.867 --> 00:00:41.876
who came into India,
most historians believe,

00:00:41.876 --> 00:00:45.043
around 1500 BCE, or maybe before that.

00:00:46.632 --> 00:00:48.781
Now by the time of Siddhartha's birth,

00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:50.971
Hinduism was really
starting to take shape.

00:00:50.971 --> 00:00:53.248
Many of the things that
we would now recognize as

00:00:53.248 --> 00:00:57.071
modern day Hindu practice already existed.

00:00:57.071 --> 00:00:59.738
And he was born into that world.

00:01:01.071 --> 00:01:03.163
Now on this map here you
see the major sites of

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:04.179
Buddha's life.

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:07.199
He's born in Lumbini,
modern day southern Napal,

00:01:07.199 --> 00:01:11.296
he eventually meditates at
Bodh Gaya under the Bodh tree

00:01:11.296 --> 00:01:13.163
where he reaches enlightenment.

00:01:13.163 --> 00:01:15.460
He does his first preaching at Sarnath,

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.530
and then he eventually dies at Kushinagar.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.987
And to modern Buddhists,
these are still considered

00:01:20.987 --> 00:01:23.415
major pilgrimage sites.

00:01:23.415 --> 00:01:27.448
So he's born, according
to tradition, at Lumbini.

00:01:27.448 --> 00:01:30.207
His mother is in transit
and born along the way

00:01:30.207 --> 00:01:31.261
at Lumbini.

00:01:31.261 --> 00:01:35.792
His mother dies shortly afterwards,
he's raised by his aunt,

00:01:35.792 --> 00:01:38.243
but his father in some accounts is a king,

00:01:38.243 --> 00:01:42.960
a chieftain, and he's able
to give the young Siddhartha

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.206
Gautama a very good,
a very sheltered life.

00:01:47.206 --> 00:01:49.404
And this life continues into his 20s,

00:01:49.404 --> 00:01:53.215
he's able to get married, have a child.

00:01:53.215 --> 00:01:57.382
But at the age of 29 he's
able to leave the compound.

00:01:58.652 --> 00:02:01.768
He's able to see the world
as it really is outside of

00:02:01.768 --> 00:02:04.590
this world that his father
has created for him,

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.200
and he sees old age, he sees
sickness, he sees poverty,

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.289
and this creates a lot of
consternation in Siddhartha.

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:15.706
He wonders why this is so,
why is there this suffering

00:02:15.706 --> 00:02:16.827
in the world?

00:02:16.827 --> 00:02:20.550
And so he decides, once again, at age 29,

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.559
to seek the truth, to try
to understand the universe

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:24.578
as it is.

00:02:24.578 --> 00:02:26.542
And remember, this is in
India where it was common

00:02:26.542 --> 00:02:29.437
practice for religious
ascetics to go off into the

00:02:29.437 --> 00:02:32.930
woods and to meditate about
the true nature of reality,

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.313
try to obtain moksha.

00:02:35.313 --> 00:02:38.341
So he goes and follows that same practice.

00:02:38.341 --> 00:02:41.501
And for six years, he is
going through the woods,

00:02:41.501 --> 00:02:45.050
he's wandering, he's left all
of his possessions behind,

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.122
he has left his family behind.

00:02:46.122 --> 00:02:49.065
He famously starts off
trying to go in the mold

00:02:49.065 --> 00:02:51.986
of these Hindu ascetics,
letting go of everything,

00:02:51.986 --> 00:02:55.937
including trying to deprive
the body of food and water,

00:02:55.937 --> 00:02:57.810
and he almost kills himself.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.087
But then eventually, at age
35, he makes his way to the

00:03:02.087 --> 00:03:05.170
town of Gaya, now known as Bodh Gaya.

00:03:06.268 --> 00:03:10.147
And over there he meditates
under a sacred fig tree,

00:03:10.147 --> 00:03:12.299
later known as the Bodhi tree.

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.770
And he meditates there for seven days.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.860
And on the seventh day, it strikes him,

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.422
he has a revelation, he
awakens, so to speak.

00:03:21.422 --> 00:03:24.002
And according to Buddhist
tradition, from that moment

00:03:24.002 --> 00:03:27.585
he becomes the Buddha,
or the awakened one.

00:03:30.137 --> 00:03:33.926
And for the next 49 days he
makes no contact with anyone,

00:03:33.926 --> 00:03:38.124
but he eventually makes
his way to Sarnath.

00:03:38.124 --> 00:03:42.870
And at a deer park there he
re-encounters five of his

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.607
previous followers and
they had given up on him.

00:03:45.607 --> 00:03:48.254
But now they see that
there's a change in Siddhartha,

00:03:48.254 --> 00:03:49.858
now the Buddha.

00:03:49.858 --> 00:03:53.671
And he begins to explain
to them what he has seen,

00:03:53.671 --> 00:03:55.588
what he has discovered.

00:03:58.547 --> 00:04:01.747
This is a quotation from the
Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta,

00:04:01.747 --> 00:04:03.429
what is was called in the Pali language,

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:05.809
which was the language of Buddha's time.

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:09.857
And it can be translated as
Setting the Wheel of Dhamma,

00:04:09.857 --> 00:04:11.953
which is another word for
Dharma, the (mumbles) word

00:04:11.953 --> 00:04:14.234
Dharma, in motion.

00:04:14.234 --> 00:04:18.884
And Dhamma in Hinduism
means this cosmological law.

00:04:18.884 --> 00:04:21.390
What you should follow in your life.

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.570
Dhamma in Buddhism, or Dharma
in Buddhism can mean that,

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.153
but it can also mean the
teachings of Buddha and the

00:04:28.153 --> 00:04:30.415
Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta.

00:04:30.415 --> 00:04:32.610
The sayings of Buddha at
Sarnath are considered to be

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.327
his first teachings to his followers.

00:04:35.327 --> 00:04:37.825
"There are these two
extremes that are not to be

00:04:37.825 --> 00:04:40.485
"indulged in by one who has gone forth.

00:04:40.485 --> 00:04:41.396
"Which two?

00:04:41.396 --> 00:04:44.026
"That which is devoted
to sensual pleasure with

00:04:44.026 --> 00:04:47.193
"reference to sensual
objects: base, vulgar, common,

00:04:47.193 --> 00:04:50.256
"ignoble, unprofitable;
and that which is devoted

00:04:50.256 --> 00:04:54.609
"to self affliction: painful,
ignoble, unprofitable.

00:04:54.609 --> 00:04:57.929
"Avoiding both of these
extremes, the middle way

00:04:57.929 --> 00:05:01.591
"leads to calm, to direct
knowledge, to self-awakening,

00:05:01.591 --> 00:05:02.841
"to Unbinding."

00:05:03.747 --> 00:05:06.560
So this is considered to
be Buddha's first reference

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.227
to the notion of the middle way.

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:13.176
And what's interesting here,
he's saying things that

00:05:13.176 --> 00:05:15.511
are consistent with many
of the Hindu ascetics

00:05:15.511 --> 00:05:16.503
of the time.

00:05:16.503 --> 00:05:19.087
That you shouldn't devote
yourself to sensual pleasure,

00:05:19.087 --> 00:05:21.329
with reference to sensual
objects, base, vulgar,

00:05:21.329 --> 00:05:23.116
common, ignoble.

00:05:23.116 --> 00:05:25.249
But he's also saying that
you shouldn't go the other

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:26.499
extreme either.

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:29.108
You shouldn't devote
yourself to self-affliction,

00:05:29.108 --> 00:05:30.719
painful, ignoble, unprofitable.

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:33.524
That, too, is not going
to lead to the truth.

00:05:33.524 --> 00:05:37.999
He says, avoid both of these
extremes, the middle way.

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:41.859
Now in the Dhammacakkappavattana
Sutta he goes on

00:05:41.859 --> 00:05:45.859
to describe what are known
as four noble truths.

00:05:49.083 --> 00:05:52.410
"Now this, monks, is the
noble truth of suffering,"

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.286
or dhukka, "Birth is
suffering, aging is suffering,

00:05:56.286 --> 00:05:58.490
"death is suffering:
sorrow, lamentation, pain,

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.690
"distress, and despair are suffering.

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.909
"Association with the
unbeloved is suffering,

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:05.512
"separation from the loved is suffering.

00:06:05.512 --> 00:06:08.844
"Not getting what is wanted is suffering."

00:06:08.844 --> 00:06:12.010
So the first noble truth,
he's describing this notion

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.938
of dhukka, this notion of suffering.

00:06:14.938 --> 00:06:17.168
And later on he goes to expand on it.

00:06:17.168 --> 00:06:19.514
Saying it's not just
traditional notions of sorrow,

00:06:19.514 --> 00:06:23.640
lamentation, pain, distress,
but it's also trying to

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.790
desire or pursue anything
that is temporary in nature

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:31.198
will eventually lead to
dhukka, or suffering.

00:06:31.198 --> 00:06:34.281
"And this, monks, is the
noble truth of the origination

00:06:34.281 --> 00:06:37.378
"of suffering, the craving
that makes for further

00:06:37.378 --> 00:06:40.470
"becoming -- accompanied
by passion and delight,

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.100
"relishing now here, and
now there -- craving for

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.718
"sensual pleasure, craving for becoming,

00:06:46.718 --> 00:06:48.860
"craving for non-becoming."

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.979
So that cause of the
suffering is this craving.

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:55.040
Craving for these impermanent things.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.624
"And this, monks, is the
noble truth of the cessation

00:06:58.624 --> 00:07:01.783
"of suffering: the remainderless
fading and cessation,

00:07:01.783 --> 00:07:03.823
"renunciation, relinquishment, release,

00:07:03.823 --> 00:07:06.736
"and letting go of that very craving."

00:07:06.736 --> 00:07:10.676
So here he's saying, "Look,
you don't have to suffer,

00:07:10.676 --> 00:07:13.670
"there's a way to escape from it."

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:17.019
And it's essentially to stop that craving.

00:07:17.019 --> 00:07:19.290
That's the third noble truth.

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:22.196
"And this, monks, is the
noble truth of the way of

00:07:22.196 --> 00:07:26.216
"practice leading to the
cessation of suffering."

00:07:26.216 --> 00:07:29.110
So, how do you actually
practice life in way

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:31.631
that you can seize this suffering?

00:07:31.631 --> 00:07:34.627
"Precisely this Noble Eightfold Path,"

00:07:34.627 --> 00:07:37.321
which is another concept
which is quoted a lot in

00:07:37.321 --> 00:07:39.879
Buddhism, this notion of
these eight things that

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:44.399
you need to do in order to
escape from this suffering,

00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:47.128
from this dhukka, from this craving.

00:07:47.128 --> 00:07:51.662
"Right view, right resolve,
right speech, right action,

00:07:51.662 --> 00:07:55.788
"right livelihood, right
effort, right mindfulness,

00:07:55.788 --> 00:07:58.502
"and right concentration."

00:07:58.502 --> 00:08:01.978
This comes from the Dhammapada,
which you can interpret

00:08:01.978 --> 00:08:03.811
as the path to dhamma.

00:08:05.289 --> 00:08:08.727
And Buddha says, "All that
we are is the result of

00:08:08.727 --> 00:08:10.419
"what we have thought: it
is founded on our thoughts,

00:08:10.419 --> 00:08:12.540
"it is made up of our thoughts."

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:15.290
Which is a core idea in Buddhism.

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:20.043
That this notion of separateness,

00:08:20.043 --> 00:08:21.697
this is just due to our thoughts,

00:08:21.697 --> 00:08:23.344
it's all happening in our mind.

00:08:23.344 --> 00:08:26.363
The psychical reality
that you think is somehow

00:08:26.363 --> 00:08:29.568
more permanent than
the transient thoughts,

00:08:29.568 --> 00:08:31.602
it's all happening in your thought,

00:08:31.602 --> 00:08:34.239
it's all happening in your
mind and the separateness

00:08:34.239 --> 00:08:36.540
is really an illusion.

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:39.468
And once again, very similar
idea to what we see in the

00:08:39.468 --> 00:08:40.985
Upanishads.

00:08:40.985 --> 00:08:45.152
Now one final idea, Buddha
taught throughout his life,

00:08:46.227 --> 00:08:48.374
and eventually dies at Kushinagar,

00:08:48.374 --> 00:08:50.217
which is one of those four
pilgrimage sites that we

00:08:50.217 --> 00:08:51.462
saw on that map.

00:08:51.462 --> 00:08:54.171
But really accelerated
the spread of Buddhism,

00:08:54.171 --> 00:08:58.630
especially beyond India,
was the reign of the emperor

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:01.284
Ashoka during the Maurya Empire.

00:09:01.284 --> 00:09:04.282
And we talk about Ashoka, we
have a whole video on him,

00:09:04.282 --> 00:09:08.528
but he eventually converts to
Buddhism and he sponsors it,

00:09:08.528 --> 00:09:11.304
he builds temples, and he
sponsors missionaries to

00:09:11.304 --> 00:09:15.569
spread Buddhism from Europe
all the way to China.

00:09:15.569 --> 00:09:18.572
And so Buddha was obviously
the central figure,

00:09:18.572 --> 00:09:21.264
but Ashoka was the accelerant
that spread Buddhism

00:09:21.264 --> 00:09:22.347
to the world.
