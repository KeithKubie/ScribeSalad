00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.169
 
so here's three of only three of the

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179
so here's three of only three of the
 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.090
so here's three of only three of the
Platonic solids the things you can make

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100
Platonic solids the things you can make
 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.130
Platonic solids the things you can make
out of equilateral triangles so here

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140
out of equilateral triangles so here
 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.080
out of equilateral triangles so here
I've got tetrahedron for triangles

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090
I've got tetrahedron for triangles
 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.820
I've got tetrahedron for triangles
octahedron eight triangles in the

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830
octahedron eight triangles in the
 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.730
octahedron eight triangles in the
icosahedron 20 triangles what's changing

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740
icosahedron 20 triangles what's changing
 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.580
icosahedron 20 triangles what's changing
as you go from here to here to here is

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590
as you go from here to here to here is
 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.279
as you go from here to here to here is
how many triangles there are around each

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289
how many triangles there are around each
 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.370
how many triangles there are around each
corner on each vertex so the tetrahedron

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380
corner on each vertex so the tetrahedron
 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.590
corner on each vertex so the tetrahedron
rate has three triangles around a corner

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600
rate has three triangles around a corner
 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.650
rate has three triangles around a corner
and the octahedron has four and the

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660
and the octahedron has four and the
 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.220
and the octahedron has four and the
icosahedron has five what comes next

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230
icosahedron has five what comes next
 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.979
icosahedron has five what comes next
well six triangles around a vertex do

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989
well six triangles around a vertex do
 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.110
well six triangles around a vertex do
you get a platonic solid that has six

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120
you get a platonic solid that has six
 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.630
you get a platonic solid that has six
triangles on a vertex no no no what do

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640
triangles on a vertex no no no what do
 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.790
triangles on a vertex no no no what do
you get so all right so here's six so

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800
you get so all right so here's six so
 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.139
you get so all right so here's six so
here's you know there's one triangle two

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149
here's you know there's one triangle two
 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.479
here's you know there's one triangle two
two three four five six so six triangles

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489
two three four five six so six triangles
 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.310
two three four five six so six triangles
around a vertex that tiles the plane

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320
around a vertex that tiles the plane
 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.260
around a vertex that tiles the plane
right it goes on forever yes so it

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270
right it goes on forever yes so it
 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.330
right it goes on forever yes so it
doesn't have any curve to it so here's a

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340
doesn't have any curve to it so here's a
 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.920
doesn't have any curve to it so here's a
way to think about it so your triangle

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930
way to think about it so your triangle
 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.700
way to think about it so your triangle
has 60 degrees at this corner and so

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710
has 60 degrees at this corner and so
 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.189
has 60 degrees at this corner and so
like 60 plus 60 plus 60 those are the

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199
like 60 plus 60 plus 60 those are the
 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.290
like 60 plus 60 plus 60 those are the
three around here that adds up to 180

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300
three around here that adds up to 180
 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.770
three around here that adds up to 180
which is well less than 360 so it sort

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780
which is well less than 360 so it sort
 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.539
which is well less than 360 so it sort
of curves it makes a cone shape if you

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549
of curves it makes a cone shape if you
 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.030
of curves it makes a cone shape if you
do this with the octahedron you get 60

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040
do this with the octahedron you get 60
 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.440
do this with the octahedron you get 60
60 60 60 which is what 240 still less

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450
60 60 60 which is what 240 still less
 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.190
60 60 60 which is what 240 still less
than 360 with five of them you've got

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200
than 360 with five of them you've got
 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.160
than 360 with five of them you've got
300 when you get to six it has of the

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170
300 when you get to six it has of the
 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.100
300 when you get to six it has of the
360 right there's no there's no lack of

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110
360 right there's no there's no lack of
 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.990
360 right there's no there's no lack of
space there's no there's nothing missing

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000
space there's no there's nothing missing
 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.460
space there's no there's nothing missing
so it doesn't make a cone it just makes

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470
so it doesn't make a cone it just makes
 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.880
so it doesn't make a cone it just makes
it flat three four five six what happens

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890
it flat three four five six what happens
 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.850
it flat three four five six what happens
if you put even if you try and put seven

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860
if you put even if you try and put seven
 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.280
if you put even if you try and put seven
triangles on each vertex actually you

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290
triangles on each vertex actually you
 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.010
triangles on each vertex actually you
know what would be good to try drawing

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020
know what would be good to try drawing
 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.899
know what would be good to try drawing
it I'm not going to be able to make them

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909
it I'm not going to be able to make them
 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.149
it I'm not going to be able to make them
all equilateral but let's see how far we

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159
all equilateral but let's see how far we
 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.770
all equilateral but let's see how far we
can get so I got to fit seven so there's

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780
can get so I got to fit seven so there's
 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.899
can get so I got to fit seven so there's
going to be one here and then I got

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909
going to be one here and then I got
 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.940
going to be one here and then I got
fitted fit three in here so I got to do

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950
fitted fit three in here so I got to do
 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.370
fitted fit three in here so I got to do
this and all right so I fit seven around

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380
this and all right so I fit seven around
 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.260
this and all right so I fit seven around
a vertex so let's keep going so I got

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270
a vertex so let's keep going so I got
 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.050
a vertex so let's keep going so I got
two here already so maybe I'll do that

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060
two here already so maybe I'll do that
 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.819
two here already so maybe I'll do that
that's 5 6 7 2 2 2 2 2 3 I got to fit

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829
that's 5 6 7 2 2 2 2 2 3 I got to fit
 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.889
that's 5 6 7 2 2 2 2 2 3 I got to fit
four in here you can go for quite a

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899
four in here you can go for quite a
 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.690
four in here you can go for quite a
while actually before you start running

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700
while actually before you start running
 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.289
while actually before you start running
into trouble

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299
into trouble
 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.490
into trouble
1 2 3 4 you can speed this up right ok 1

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500
1 2 3 4 you can speed this up right ok 1
 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.339
1 2 3 4 you can speed this up right ok 1
2 3 4 I got to fit 3 in here you see it

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349
2 3 4 I got to fit 3 in here you see it
 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.229
2 3 4 I got to fit 3 in here you see it
starts getting difficult there's too

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239
starts getting difficult there's too
 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.520
starts getting difficult there's too
many of them they

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530
many of them they
 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.310
many of them they
don't really fit very nicely and you

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320
don't really fit very nicely and you
 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.110
don't really fit very nicely and you
start oh now I'm in real trouble look at

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120
start oh now I'm in real trouble look at
 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.610
start oh now I'm in real trouble look at
this one two three four I got to fit

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620
this one two three four I got to fit
 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.670
this one two three four I got to fit
three in here one two three four in here

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680
three in here one two three four in here
 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.070
three in here one two three four in here
so Wow I mean you can sort of see that

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080
so Wow I mean you can sort of see that
 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.440
so Wow I mean you can sort of see that
like this iswell try it at home right

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450
like this iswell try it at home right
 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.510
like this iswell try it at home right
how far can you get drawing triangles

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520
how far can you get drawing triangles
 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.270
how far can you get drawing triangles
seven triangles on each vertex what if I

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280
seven triangles on each vertex what if I
 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.340
seven triangles on each vertex what if I
don't do it on paper what if I do with

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350
don't do it on paper what if I do with
 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.310
don't do it on paper what if I do with
3d printed stuff then you get this thing

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320
3d printed stuff then you get this thing
 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.890
3d printed stuff then you get this thing
so right well you can see there one two

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900
so right well you can see there one two
 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.140
so right well you can see there one two
three four or five six seven triangles

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150
three four or five six seven triangles
 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.030
three four or five six seven triangles
around each vertex you know the first

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040
around each vertex you know the first
 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.229
around each vertex you know the first
thing you try and do is you try and lay

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239
thing you try and do is you try and lay
 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.660
thing you try and do is you try and lay
it flat and it doesn't work like you can

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670
it flat and it doesn't work like you can
 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.610
it flat and it doesn't work like you can
make bits of it be kind of flat and

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620
make bits of it be kind of flat and
 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.170
make bits of it be kind of flat and
there's some given the hinges which sort

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180
there's some given the hinges which sort
 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.550
there's some given the hinges which sort
of helps out but then it bunches up

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560
of helps out but then it bunches up
 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.800
of helps out but then it bunches up
somewhere else like there's just no way

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810
somewhere else like there's just no way
 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.900
somewhere else like there's just no way
to make it flat everywhere it doesn't

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910
to make it flat everywhere it doesn't
 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.880
to make it flat everywhere it doesn't
work right what is going on right these

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890
work right what is going on right these
 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.800
work right what is going on right these
are sort of like they're closed around

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810
are sort of like they're closed around
 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.440
are sort of like they're closed around
this or like spheres right three four

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450
this or like spheres right three four
 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.960
this or like spheres right three four
and five six is like the flat plane

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970
and five six is like the flat plane
 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.420
and five six is like the flat plane
sphere plane what is this thing trying

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430
sphere plane what is this thing trying
 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.300
sphere plane what is this thing trying
to be it doesn't look like it's some

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310
to be it doesn't look like it's some
 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.220
to be it doesn't look like it's some
nice surface is just some horrible thing

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230
nice surface is just some horrible thing
 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.840
nice surface is just some horrible thing
we don't know what seven is maybe eight

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850
we don't know what seven is maybe eight
 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:21.440
we don't know what seven is maybe eight
will be better

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450
will be better
 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.570
will be better
no no eight is not better right so this

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580
no no eight is not better right so this
 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.180
no no eight is not better right so this
is eight equilateral triangles around

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190
is eight equilateral triangles around
 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.150
is eight equilateral triangles around
each vertex like I mean you can count

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160
each vertex like I mean you can count
 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.039
each vertex like I mean you can count
them but like it's this horribly crinkly

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049
them but like it's this horribly crinkly
 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.770
them but like it's this horribly crinkly
it's sort of like it's like coral or

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780
it's sort of like it's like coral or
 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.330
it's sort of like it's like coral or
it's like lettuce so these are

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340
it's like lettuce so these are
 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.030
it's like lettuce so these are
positively curved things which like a

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040
positively curved things which like a
 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.550
positively curved things which like a
hill or a bowl sort of curves towards

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560
hill or a bowl sort of curves towards
 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.220
hill or a bowl sort of curves towards
you in all directions whereas like

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230
you in all directions whereas like
 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.229
you in all directions whereas like
something that's flat it's not it's not

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239
something that's flat it's not it's not
 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.539
something that's flat it's not it's not
curving at all or like like it can curve

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549
curving at all or like like it can curve
 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.460
curving at all or like like it can curve
in one direction but then the other

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470
in one direction but then the other
 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.620
in one direction but then the other
direction is is flat right as I map does

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630
direction is is flat right as I map does
 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.330
direction is is flat right as I map does
that make sense like it's curved this

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340
that make sense like it's curved this
 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.920
that make sense like it's curved this
way but it has to be flat this where you

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930
way but it has to be flat this where you
 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.810
way but it has to be flat this where you
can't curve it in both directions so one

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820
can't curve it in both directions so one
 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:57.890
can't curve it in both directions so one
of the directions is flat was really

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900
of the directions is flat was really
 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.740
of the directions is flat was really
just flat and these are like so it wants

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750
just flat and these are like so it wants
 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.110
just flat and these are like so it wants
to be like a saddle so you imagine my

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120
to be like a saddle so you imagine my
 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.449
to be like a saddle so you imagine my
hand is a horse right and like the hand

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459
hand is a horse right and like the hand
 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.220
hand is a horse right and like the hand
is like awesome like your legs go either

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230
is like awesome like your legs go either
 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.740
is like awesome like your legs go either
side of here so so right so what does

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750
side of here so so right so what does
 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.270
side of here so so right so what does
that mean like sometimes it's curving

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280
that mean like sometimes it's curving
 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.190
that mean like sometimes it's curving
towards you and sometimes it's curving

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200
towards you and sometimes it's curving
 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.750
towards you and sometimes it's curving
away from you so when you've got both of

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760
away from you so when you've got both of
 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.940
away from you so when you've got both of
those that's negative coach or negative

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950
those that's negative coach or negative
 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.650
those that's negative coach or negative
Gaussian curvature so what are these

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660
Gaussian curvature so what are these
 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.539
Gaussian curvature so what are these
things these are sort of like so these

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549
things these are sort of like so these
 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.060
things these are sort of like so these
are models of hyperbolic space in a way

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070
are models of hyperbolic space in a way
 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.770
are models of hyperbolic space in a way
there's sort of too much of it it

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780
there's sort of too much of it it
 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.440
there's sort of too much of it it
doesn't want to fit in or

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450
doesn't want to fit in or
 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.900
doesn't want to fit in or
Euclidean space it kind of wrinkles up

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910
Euclidean space it kind of wrinkles up
 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.090
Euclidean space it kind of wrinkles up
and gets out of control so these these

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100
and gets out of control so these these
 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.040
and gets out of control so these these
ones here right you you run out of

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050
ones here right you you run out of
 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.570

evening you're done this one I could
 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.550
evening you're done this one I could
have kept going forever right is it's

like I could just keep tying this

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850
like I could just keep tying this
 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.060

outwards and it was just you know fall

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070
outwards and it was just you know fall
 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.010

world this one well so again I've only

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570
world this one well so again I've only
 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.330
world this one well so again I've only
done like a little bit of it it's it

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340
done like a little bit of it it's it
 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.910
done like a little bit of it it's it
seems clear that I could keep going I

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:51.920
seems clear that I could keep going I
 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.920
seems clear that I could keep going I
mean I tried doing it over here with the

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930
mean I tried doing it over here with the
 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.620
mean I tried doing it over here with the
the pen but it was sort of you know it's

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630
the pen but it was sort of you know it's
 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.780
the pen but it was sort of you know it's
difficult but it seems like you know if

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790
difficult but it seems like you know if
 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:59.980
difficult but it seems like you know if
you're allowed to sort of wrinkle them

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990
you're allowed to sort of wrinkle them
 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.930
you're allowed to sort of wrinkle them
up out of the plane and like make this

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940
up out of the plane and like make this
 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.430
up out of the plane and like make this
sort of wrinkly thing then I could just

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440
sort of wrinkly thing then I could just
 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.100
sort of wrinkly thing then I could just
keep going well you kind of might run

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110
keep going well you kind of might run
 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.720
keep going well you kind of might run
into trouble so there's actually an open

could put triangles but the number of
 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:34.780

maybe you'd somehow be able to fit them

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490
maybe you'd somehow be able to fit them
 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.820
maybe you'd somehow be able to fit them
in without crashing into each other we

don't think so

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610
don't think so
 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.670
don't think so
but there's no proof like nobody knows

what's the what's the the farthest now
you can go I mean it's sort of like

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:16.100
you can go I mean it's sort of like
 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.000
you can go I mean it's sort of like
really crinkly and nasty and not really

really crinkly and nasty and not really
smooth and in the same in same sort of

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:21.200
smooth and in the same in same sort of
 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.780
smooth and in the same in same sort of
way like the icosahedron is not that

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:22.790
way like the icosahedron is not that
 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.000
way like the icosahedron is not that
smooth it's got these sort of corners so

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.010
smooth it's got these sort of corners so
 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.220
smooth it's got these sort of corners so
what you can do to an icosahedron to

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:27.230
what you can do to an icosahedron to
 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.710
what you can do to an icosahedron to
make it smoother is like make a geodesic

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:29.720
make it smoother is like make a geodesic
 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.360
make it smoother is like make a geodesic
dome so here's one way to do it right

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.370
dome so here's one way to do it right
 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.670
dome so here's one way to do it right
you take each triangle and you subdivide

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680
you take each triangle and you subdivide
 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.590
you take each triangle and you subdivide
it into four you know like a Triforce

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:35.600
it into four you know like a Triforce
 

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.150
it into four you know like a Triforce
cut it into four and then you've got

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:37.160
cut it into four and then you've got
 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.010
cut it into four and then you've got
these extra vertices on in the middle of

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:39.020
these extra vertices on in the middle of
 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.150
these extra vertices on in the middle of
the edges and you push them out to the

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160
the edges and you push them out to the
 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.800
the edges and you push them out to the
fear and that makes a smoother

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:41.810
fear and that makes a smoother
 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.590
fear and that makes a smoother
polyhedron it's no longer regular but

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:44.600
polyhedron it's no longer regular but
 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.000
polyhedron it's no longer regular but
you know it's a smoother thing that's

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.010
you know it's a smoother thing that's
 

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.070
you know it's a smoother thing that's
more like a sphere so I was like all

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080
more like a sphere so I was like all
 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.000
more like a sphere so I was like all
right let's do that with this it's got

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.010
right let's do that with this it's got
 

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.490
right let's do that with this it's got
this crinkly thing that's too like here

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:54.500
this crinkly thing that's too like here
 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.110
this crinkly thing that's too like here
that like that the angles that up to

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.120
that like that the angles that up to
 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.760
that like that the angles that up to
what 360 plus 60 is 420 it's too many

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:00.770
what 360 plus 60 is 420 it's too many
 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:02.440
what 360 plus 60 is 420 it's too many
there's like a lot of angle at each

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:02.450
there's like a lot of angle at each
 

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:05.220
there's like a lot of angle at each
vertex so if you do this sort of like

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:05.230
vertex so if you do this sort of like
 

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:09.580
vertex so if you do this sort of like
geodesic dome thing with this thing then

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:09.590
geodesic dome thing with this thing then
 

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.320
geodesic dome thing with this thing then
it turns into this thing so this is like

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:11.330
it turns into this thing so this is like
 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.690
it turns into this thing so this is like
a little hot it's a little hard to see

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:13.700
a little hot it's a little hard to see
 

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.750
a little hot it's a little hard to see
but so I don't can see this right so

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:16.760
but so I don't can see this right so
 

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.410
but so I don't can see this right so
these four triangles the the three on

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:20.420
these four triangles the the three on
 

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.090
these four triangles the the three on
the outside are slightly isosceles and

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:22.100
the outside are slightly isosceles and
 

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.110
the outside are slightly isosceles and
the one in the middle is actually

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:23.120
the one in the middle is actually
 

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.300
the one in the middle is actually
equilateral so this is subdivided than

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:25.310
equilateral so this is subdivided than
 

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:27.610
equilateral so this is subdivided than
then and then the vertices to the extra

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:27.620
then and then the vertices to the extra
 

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:28.750
then and then the vertices to the extra
vertices just squished around a little

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:28.760
vertices just squished around a little
 

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.400
vertices just squished around a little
bit to make it make it a bit smoother

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:30.410
bit to make it make it a bit smoother
 

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:32.890
bit to make it make it a bit smoother
and then it's it's nicer right it's sort

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:32.900
and then it's it's nicer right it's sort
 

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.400
and then it's it's nicer right it's sort
of you can get quite large bits of it to

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:36.410
of you can get quite large bits of it to
 

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.710
of you can get quite large bits of it to
be flat or you can't get all of it to be

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:38.720
be flat or you can't get all of it to be
 

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.970
be flat or you can't get all of it to be
flat it always sort of bunches up

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:39.980
flat it always sort of bunches up
 

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.920
flat it always sort of bunches up
somewhere no matter how hard you try

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:41.930
somewhere no matter how hard you try
 

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:44.020
somewhere no matter how hard you try
looks like a doily yeah it's a

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:44.030
looks like a doily yeah it's a
 

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.110
looks like a doily yeah it's a
hyperbolic doily that's what it is

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:46.120
hyperbolic doily that's what it is
 

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.580
hyperbolic doily that's what it is
it really likes to be in sort of like

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:48.590
it really likes to be in sort of like
 

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:52.780
it really likes to be in sort of like
saddles or crinkly star for yeah fun to

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:52.790
saddles or crinkly star for yeah fun to
 

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:55.810
saddles or crinkly star for yeah fun to
play with on the short side so long side

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:55.820
play with on the short side so long side
 

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.030
play with on the short side so long side
is n the short side is n minus one so

00:07:58.030 --> 00:07:58.040
is n the short side is n minus one so
 

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.180
is n the short side is n minus one so
each rectangle is n times n minus 1

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:01.190
each rectangle is n times n minus 1
 

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.610
each rectangle is n times n minus 1
there's three of them so there's three

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:03.620
there's three of them so there's three
 

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.350
there's three of them so there's three
lots of that and then there's one in the

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:05.360
lots of that and then there's one in the
 

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.650
lots of that and then there's one in the
middle well right so that's a really

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:08.660
middle well right so that's a really
 

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:12.130
middle well right so that's a really
hard question okay all right here we go
