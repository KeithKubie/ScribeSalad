the film for that just because Laura

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510
the film for that just because Laura
 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.940
the film for that just because Laura

because if that's really how it was then
 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.060
because if that's really how it was then
that's how it was and that's fine my

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070
that's how it was and that's fine my

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.210
think if it had been in chronological
order as I said it would have been more

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220
order as I said it would have been more
 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.550
order as I said it would have been more

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.640
and Anna Gunn in particular I think
these performances really worked also

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650
these performances really worked also
 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.469
these performances really worked also

does have a good feeling of suspense and
 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.809
does have a good feeling of suspense and
for all those reasons I enjoyed Sully
