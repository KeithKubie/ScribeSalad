[Captions by Y Translator]
Today, we're gonna
see what happens

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:02.740
when we take our design for ninja balls,

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:04.950
and scale them up
to much larger balloons

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.460
holding 10 pounds of flour at once.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.660
And then we might see what happens
if we drop that 10-pound flour balloon

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:11.760
off of a tall roof.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:19.000
[Music]

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.220
These flour filled balloons are what
we call ninja balls or stress balls.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.340
They're fun because they have some good
resistance when you squeeze them.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.410
They kind of keep their shape
after we flatten them out a little bit,

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.210
and overall, there's a lot
of things you can do with them.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.259
They work as stress balls,
they're great for juggling,

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:35.240
or we've shown you how you
can attach parachutes onto them,

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.350
chuck them up in the sky,

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.820
and have them float gently down.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.360
Well today, we wanted to see
what happens if we scaled that up.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.340
Not too long ago, we showed
you how to build this sort of

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.440
reverse vacuum chamber.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.280
It's literally a vacuum chamber.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.000
You attach a vacuum cleaner on to,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.800
but with a balloon stretched
around the mouth here at the top,

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.670
and when you do that,
it inflates the balloon from the outside.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:56.820
Well, while I was doing that,

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.600
I thought what else could
we fill one of these large balloons with,

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.880
other than a shark
with a laser on its head.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.140
I thought it'd be cool to see if we
could make one of our ninja balls,

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.060
but out of much bigger balloons.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.940
Here's the basic idea.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.340
We'll stretch our balloon open,
fill it up with ten pounds of flour,

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.620
and then add two more
layers of balloon on top of that.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:26.800
[Music]

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.620
Our balloon is now completely
stretched inside the bucket.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.840
It's reaching every single
edge, nook, and cranny.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.360
Now, we've got this giant wide nozzle,

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.640
and we can pour in
our 10 pounds of flour.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.920
[Music]

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.920
The flour is in there.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.180
Now, we're gonna take
the balloon off of this opening,

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.580
and all the air is gonna run out,

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.260
and it's gonna start spraying
flour in the air like that.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.160
At this point, the balloon,
it has a little bit of air in it,

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.020
it's squishing the flour,

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.220
and the flour itself has a lot of air in it.

00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:03.720
It was kind of well packed
when it was in the bag,

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.600
but as I poured it out,
it got a lot of air introduced into it,

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.080
so we have very fluffy flour
in our balloon right now,

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.100
and the balloon squeezing
is actually enough to

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.920
try and push some of that flour out

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.140
so you can see if I just let go,

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.940
it sort of starts bubbling out the top.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.575
What we need to do is
compact this flour back down,

00:02:19.575 --> 00:02:22.020
and to do that, we're basically
just going to take it out,

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.250
and squish it around for a while.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.480
And I'm going to get
covered in flour today.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.620
[Music]

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.680
There we go.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.500
Try and tie a knot in this balloon.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.060
One giant balloon full of flour.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.040
Now, the goal is to
cover it in more balloons,

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.600
and to do that, we're gonna follow
the same strategy that we did

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.879
with our little ninja balls,

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.600
and we're gonna cut
the neck off of a balloon,

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.019
and try and stretch it over
what we've already got here.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.380
First, I'm going to try and wash
it off so it's not so slippery.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.180
So the balloon sticks
to it a little better.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.420
This part can get a little bit tricky
because I need this balloon to stretch

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.660
enough to fit over
the balloon that's full of flour,

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.340
but I don't want it to tear,

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.049
and I want it to stay closed
enough that after its wrapped

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.140
around this balloon,
it doesn't just slide right off.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:16.680
[Music]

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.880
Okay, our balloon actually
did tear a little bit fitting on there,

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.200
so now, it looks like a balloon
wearing pants that are too tight for it.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.880
[Music]

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.220
Now it looks like a swim cap.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.700
[Music]

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:32.700
Sweet.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.220
[Music]

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.580
Got layer 2 on, let's go for one more.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.920
[Music]

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.060
Alright.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.140
There we go.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.260
It needs its ninja mask.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:53.140
[Music]

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.420
I keep wiping the balloon off
because there's flour all over the table,

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.749
and when there's too much flour,
the balloons don't like to stick

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:02.949
to each other, the different layers
don't and so if I try and apply a piece

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:06.650
of balloon over another balloon,
then it just sort of slides right off.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:07.140
Alright.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.800
I'd say now we have a giant ninja ball,
or maybe a regular-sized Yoshi egg.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.820
It might not be quite as good
for relieving stress as the regular size.

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:17.440
You can't just hold it
in one hand and squish it,

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.300
and frankly, if I had this in my office,

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.820
I'd be terrified of popping it
and getting so much flour

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.940
that a professional
cleaning crew needed to come in.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.270
I have a fairly tall building that
I'm allowed to throw stuff off of.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.460
At least, for now.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.740
They may kick me out after I try
this, but I'm gonna throw this off,

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.300
and see if it explodes on the ground.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.180
We've now come to a location where
I can take this 10-pound flour-filled

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.720
Yoshi egg balloon,
and drop it off the roof.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.760
Should be good.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:47.180
[Music]

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.580
Alright, here we go.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.100
Giant balloon Yoshi egg.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.220
Ten pounds of flour wrapped in balloons,

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.940
let's see what happens when this
hits the ground from about 25 feet up.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.220
[Music]

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.480
I thought it would tear right open.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.140
Oh, that's great.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.580
Well, the outside layer
of balloon ripped a little.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.960
More power.
I need to throw it harder.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.740
Alright.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.080
I thought this was gonna tear right open,

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.820
but apparently,
that's not what it wanted to do.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.700
We've lost our outer shell a little bit.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.780
Our balloon ninja mask has suffered,

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.480
but the rest of it seems to be doing okay.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.980
So, I'm gonna take it up,
and I'm just gonna throw it down.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.860
See if I can get it to
tear open like that.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.840
Attempt number 2.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.020
This time with more force.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.180
Three, two, one.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.820
Oh my goodness!

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.800
I had no idea three balloons would
have that kind of strength behind it.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.300
Alright.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.540
I have an idea.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.700
Back when we were filling these up,
I thought ten pounds of flour,

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:49.700
that's pretty good in a balloon.

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.500
But what would be even better
would be 25 pounds of flour.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.820
So, I put a balloon in that bucket,
and filled it all the way up.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.000
It's actually more like 23
and 1/2 pounds of flour,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.360
but we're gonna try that one now.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.360
Alright.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.560
Let's see if we can get
this balloon out of the bucket intact.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.180
[Music]

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.520
It's kind of bucket shaped.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.340
There's only one layer of balloon on this.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.620
So, if this doesn't pop,
I'm amazed at the strength of balloons,

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:18.940
but let's try it.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.280
[Music]

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.160
Yeah!

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.160
That's what I was looking for.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.680
Well, it didn't work on the first couple
of tries with the smaller balloon,

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.660
but the bigger one
with 25 pounds of flour in it,

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.020
that exploded beautifully.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.280
That was great.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.960
I just like dropping exploding
things off of tall buildings.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.530
And now I have a
regular-sized ninja ball,

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.780
and we're gonna see what
happens if it lands in the flour.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.540
[Music]

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.040
It's pretty much what I expected.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.080
I do have one more of the 10-pound ones.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.080
I made this before.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.920
It doesn't have its ninja
wrapping around it,

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.820
but I think it'll probably look really
cool landing in the giant pile of flour.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.840
It's the size of me head.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:06:59.720
Here it goes.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.380
[Music]

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.200
That did look cool landing
in the giant pile of flour.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.180
Neat.

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:09.330
Anything else you we should be doing
with giant 10-pound balloons of flour

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.860
that are surprisingly
resistant to damage?

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.480
Ten pounds of flour
inside three layers of balloon,

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.530
a lot tougher than
I thought it was gonna be.

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:20.340
I thought this was just
gonna tear right open.

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.820
This is not like nice,
smooth ground either.

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:26.240
There's gravel, and sand,
and screws, and nails, and stuff on it.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.160
Thought it'd shred open.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:27.740
It did not.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.240
Fortunately, we had
our 25 pound Big Bertha.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.140
That exploded beautifully,
just what I was hoping to see,

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:37.590
and it also looked really cool dropping
the 10-pound ball on to the flour.

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:39.360
Got like a secondary
explosion out of that.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.320
Very fun stuff.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.200
Let us know what else
you'd like to see us do with these,

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.340
or maybe some other things you'd like
to see us drop from tall heights.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:51.840
Guys, the fun doesn't end here.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:52.800
There's more for you see.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.640
The box at the top will transport
you directly to our last video,

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:56.680
and you should go check that out.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.860
The box at the bottom will
show you that YouTube thinks

00:07:58.870 --> 00:07:59.990
you should be watching next.

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:02.340
And if you hit this bomb in the middle,
you will be subscribed to our channel,

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.540
and that way, you'll never
miss out on a cool video.

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.640
Don't forget to ring that bell,
and we will see you in the next one.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:07.200
Talk to you then
