You've now learned about the most powerful thing about GPUs, their

00:00:02.654 --> 00:00:05.916
programmability. GPUs are astounding things, and I guess that could be almost

00:00:05.916 --> 00:00:09.220
considered inevitable. A quarter of our brain is used to process what comes

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.916
from our eyes. We're a very visual species. If we were blood hounds, we might

00:00:12.916 --> 00:00:17.346
be using NPUs, nasal processing units. Me? I was amazed when 3D accelerators

00:00:17.346 --> 00:00:21.139
caught on in the last half of the 1990s. Who would pay a few hundred bucks just

00:00:21.139 --> 00:00:24.843
to accelerate a few applications? Luckily, I was wrong. I've decided to ask a

00:00:24.843 --> 00:00:27.720
few other people what they've found surprising over the past years.
