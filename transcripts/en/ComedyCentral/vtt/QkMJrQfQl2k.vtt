- I love pot.
I love it.

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:05.398
People think that I actually
have a problem with pot,

00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:07.600
but I don't remember
their fucking names,

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.769
so it doesn't matter to me.

00:01:09.769 --> 00:01:11.170
It doesn't affect me at all.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.239
But I don't like
traveling with pot.

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:15.408
Being a comedian, you got
to travel all over the place.

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:17.576
I'm not good going
through the airport.

00:01:17.576 --> 00:01:19.412
I'm paranoid enough as it is.

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:21.948
I'm usually high
on the way to the airport.

00:01:21.948 --> 00:01:24.950
So the last thing I need
is to be my own drug mule,

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.454
going to TSA worrying
about getting busted, you know?

00:01:28.454 --> 00:01:30.122
Last time I did it, Ari told me,

00:01:30.122 --> 00:01:32.691
"Just put some joints
in an airtight thing

00:01:32.691 --> 00:01:34.093
and put it
in your underwear."

00:01:34.093 --> 00:01:35.461
They have these little
airtight containers.

00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:36.962
So I put the joints
in the airtight thing,

00:01:36.962 --> 00:01:38.030
and I put it in my underwear.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.331
And as I'm going through TSA,

00:01:39.331 --> 00:01:41.267
it starts to slip
down my pants leg.

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:43.770
And now I'm like, "Oh, boy,
if it falls out, this is it."

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.139
So I'm dead-legging it the rest
of the way through the airport.

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:50.476

and the show's got
a huge stoner demographic,

00:02:07.893 --> 00:02:09.862
so I'm taken care of.

00:02:09.862 --> 00:02:11.697
Lot of heavy handshakes
on the road.

00:02:11.697 --> 00:02:14.066

with Kevin.

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:27.480
to take drunk and stoned Kevin
wherever he has to go.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.481
But this pot,
it doesn't come free, you know.

00:02:29.481 --> 00:02:31.517
You think, "Oh, you're just
gonna get free pot on the road."

00:02:31.517 --> 00:02:34.220
No.
There's a price you pay.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.323
Yeah.
Awkward conversations.

00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:39.692
Dealing with people who aren't
used to smoking pot.

00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:41.528
I smoke a fucking shit ton
of pot.

00:02:41.528 --> 00:02:42.895
I'm used to it,

00:02:42.895 --> 00:02:44.864
but you will get people
who just smoke so much

00:02:44.864 --> 00:02:47.666
that they just smoke themselves
onto the spectrum.

00:02:47.666 --> 00:02:50.203
You know? They just--
they smoke themselves special.

00:02:50.203 --> 00:02:51.871
They'll just stare at you.

00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:53.439
And you got to deal
with these people.

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:55.875
You're among strangers.
You don't want to be rude.

00:02:55.875 --> 00:02:57.543
So you're just, like, hanging
out with them,

00:02:57.543 --> 00:03:01.047
and they'll just stand there,
lingering, staring at you,

00:03:01.047 --> 00:03:04.450
you know, introducing themselves
multiple times,

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.054
asking questions, answering
questions nobody else asked.

00:03:08.054 --> 00:03:10.222
Just weird...
[groaning awkwardly]

00:03:10.222 --> 00:03:13.226
You try not to--"Hey, man,
I think our time here is done."

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:14.961
They don't pick up
on any social cues.

00:03:14.961 --> 00:03:17.229
So you have to deal
with these people.

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:20.266
I call these people
pot blockers, okay?

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:22.535
They block the fun
for everybody else.

00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:25.738
We all want to be fun on pot,
and you're ruining it for us.

00:03:25.738 --> 00:03:27.073
So I stay away
from the pot blockers.

00:03:27.073 --> 00:03:29.242
And now--recently
I was in Nashville,

00:03:29.242 --> 00:03:31.377
and after my first show--
I was doing stand-up.

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:33.246
After the first show,
talking to people,

00:03:33.246 --> 00:03:35.982
hanging out after,
smoking joints with the staff,

00:03:35.982 --> 00:03:38.084
some fans hanging out, and
it was real shit dirt weed.

00:03:38.084 --> 00:03:39.785
So I'm not usually like this,
but I was like,

00:03:39.785 --> 00:03:41.254
"Hey, I don't want to be
an asshole,

00:03:41.254 --> 00:03:43.389
"but does anyone have
any better weed than this?

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:46.091
You know, like, I didn't come to
Nashville for this shit weed."

00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:47.727
And they were like,
"Oh, let's go to Santa's.

00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:49.562
I got some friends.
We can smoke some pot there."

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:52.097
And I was like, "Fuck, yeah,
sounds like a great idea."

00:03:52.097 --> 00:03:56.402
So I pile into a car
filled with strangers...

00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:58.804

go wrong, guys?

00:04:01.474 --> 00:04:02.942
What could go wrong?

00:04:02.942 --> 00:04:04.510
And as I'm dri--
They're driving.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.279
We're smoking
more of this shit weed,

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:08.014
and I'm starting
to get paranoid,

00:04:08.014 --> 00:04:09.949
'cause I'm seeing
less and less civilization

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:13.286
and more and more
"Making a Murderer," you know?

00:04:13.286 --> 00:04:15.488
I don't know if we passed
Steven Avery's house,

00:04:15.488 --> 00:04:16.655
but I think I saw him.

00:04:16.655 --> 00:04:18.424
And now I'm like, "Oh, shit."

00:04:18.424 --> 00:04:20.459
I'm getting nervous,
'cause I'm like, "This is it."

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.328
I know what
I'm in the middle of.

00:04:22.328 --> 00:04:24.497
I'm being kidnapped. I'm
in the middle of being kidna--

00:04:24.497 --> 00:04:26.465
This is Kidnapping 101.

00:04:26.465 --> 00:04:28.134
This is the first thing
you would teach--

00:04:28.134 --> 00:04:30.369
You would be like, "Hey, buddy.
Hey, you.

00:04:30.369 --> 00:04:31.603
"You like puppies?

00:04:31.603 --> 00:04:34.373
"Yeah, my friend Santa's
got all the puppies.

00:04:34.373 --> 00:04:36.308
"He's got them.
Get in the van.

00:04:36.308 --> 00:04:38.644
He's got them in a bucket
at home--he'll give you one."

00:04:38.644 --> 00:04:40.980
"Okay, I'll get in the van."

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.449
So I'm nervous,
and then all of a sudden,

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:45.485
one of the passengers we're with
goes, "Oh, we're here.

00:04:45.485 --> 00:04:47.719
We're here. We reached it.
This is Santa's Pub."

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:49.722
And that's where we were going,
Santa's Pub.

00:04:49.722 --> 00:04:53.726
Santa's Pub is the number-one
dive bar in Nashville,

00:04:53.726 --> 00:04:55.661
and it's not really--
Have you been there before?

00:04:55.661 --> 00:04:59.798
I mean, it's not really a bar
as much as it is

00:04:59.798 --> 00:05:04.404
a double-wide trailer that they
tried to convert into a bar

00:05:04.404 --> 00:05:06.338
and just shoved it
into the middle of the woods.

00:05:06.338 --> 00:05:10.542
It looks like Santa Claus went
through a really bad divorce

00:05:10.542 --> 00:05:12.011
in the '70s

00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:14.813
and this is all
Mrs. Claus would give him.

00:05:14.813 --> 00:05:18.417
Just take your shanty shack
and sit in the woods, fat man.

00:05:18.417 --> 00:05:21.020
[laughter]

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.388
Here's a great example

00:05:22.388 --> 00:05:24.857
of the clientele
that goes to Santa's Pub.

00:05:24.857 --> 00:05:27.393
Beer is $1.

00:05:27.393 --> 00:05:29.562
Water is $2.

00:05:29.562 --> 00:05:30.663
Yes.

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:32.165
So anyplace--
Think about it.

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:35.201
Anyplace where beer is less
expensive than water

00:05:35.201 --> 00:05:37.035
and you're not
in Flint, Michigan,

00:05:37.035 --> 00:05:38.704

00:05:38.704 --> 00:05:41.707
[cheers and applause]

00:05:41.707 --> 00:05:43.009
So I was like, "Fuck it.

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:44.711
Let's go
into this Santa's hovel."

00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:46.946
We walk inside, and they do
karaoke every night.

00:05:46.946 --> 00:05:48.748
Karaoke seven nights a week,

00:05:48.748 --> 00:05:50.683
'cause it's Nashville,
and everyone can sing.

00:05:50.683 --> 00:05:52.050
They take it seriously.

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.418
Everyone's hanging out.
They're singing.

00:05:53.418 --> 00:05:55.088
They're getting
their songs together.

00:05:55.088 --> 00:05:56.722
And this dirt weed
must have started kicking in,

00:05:56.722 --> 00:05:58.457
because now I'm in the book
and I'm like, "What"--

00:05:58.457 --> 00:06:00.259
I'm already picking out
my third song.

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:02.795
I've got one and two.

00:06:02.795 --> 00:06:05.531
I've got "I'm Too Sexy"
followed by "Pink Cadillac."

00:06:05.531 --> 00:06:09.034
In my mind, I would've taken the
house down with "Pink Cadillac."

00:06:09.034 --> 00:06:10.703
And all of a sudden,
everyone went nuts,

00:06:10.703 --> 00:06:12.404
because that's when
Santa showed up--

00:06:12.404 --> 00:06:14.073
the guy that owns the place,
Santa's Pub--

00:06:14.073 --> 00:06:16.542
and he was with his buddy,
and this Santa Claus--

00:06:16.542 --> 00:06:18.911
he takes it
very seriously, okay?

00:06:18.911 --> 00:06:20.146
This is not ironic Santa.

00:06:20.146 --> 00:06:21.413
He's got the beard,

00:06:21.413 --> 00:06:24.317
the hair, all white,
the big belly,

00:06:24.317 --> 00:06:26.419
except he puts his own
little twist on it, okay?

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:28.420
He looks like Santa Claus
gave up

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.422
all that Christmas nonsense
20 years ago

00:06:30.422 --> 00:06:32.925
and started making meth
in the woods with his friends.

00:06:32.925 --> 00:06:36.629
He's a little rough around
the edges, this Santa Claus.

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:38.330
I was fixated on it.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.065
I couldn't believe it, but
everybody else was so psyched.

00:06:40.065 --> 00:06:41.934
They didn't care about Santa.
They cared about his friend.

00:06:41.934 --> 00:06:43.402
They were like,
"Oh, shit, he's here."

00:06:43.402 --> 00:06:44.770
I'm like, "Who?"
They're like, "That guy is

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:47.072
the greatest unknown singer
in Nashville."

00:06:47.072 --> 00:06:48.106
I'm like, "Really?

00:06:48.106 --> 00:06:50.242
"The guy in pajama pants, Tevas,

00:06:50.242 --> 00:06:52.744
and a T-shirt
in the middle of the woods?"

00:06:52.744 --> 00:06:55.281
They're like, "Oh, no, that
guy's got a voice of an angel."

00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:56.849
I'm like, "Oh, sure.

00:06:56.849 --> 00:06:59.118
I heard that's how Springsteen
started out, too."

00:06:59.118 --> 00:07:00.352
Like, "Oh,
you have to hear him sing."

00:07:00.352 --> 00:07:01.587
I'm like, "Well,
when does he go on?"

00:07:01.587 --> 00:07:03.489
They go, "Well,
he smokes pot with Santa

00:07:03.489 --> 00:07:04.857
"around the back
of the trailer,

00:07:04.857 --> 00:07:06.758
and then he goes on
whenever he feels like it."

00:07:06.758 --> 00:07:09.528
And all I heard was
"smokes pot with Santa,"

00:07:09.528 --> 00:07:11.497
and I fucking bee-lined
for the door.

00:07:11.497 --> 00:07:15.434
I was like, "I'm going to find
these fuckers."

00:07:15.434 --> 00:07:19.504
30 seconds later, I am slopping
through the snow in Jordans

00:07:19.504 --> 00:07:22.374
around the back
of his double-wide trailer.

00:07:22.374 --> 00:07:24.710
Pitch black, I can't see
anything at all.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.379
I'm going, "Santa?

00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:31.383
Santa?
Is Santa here?"

00:07:31.383 --> 00:07:33.052
Finally look over,
and I see three people.

00:07:33.052 --> 00:07:35.487
I see Santa Claus,
the angel-voiced guy,

00:07:35.487 --> 00:07:37.390
and a third person
who was holding court.

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:39.357
The guy was in the middle
of a conversation, talking,

00:07:39.357 --> 00:07:40.560
and I walked up to them, right?

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.194
And they must have
heard me coming,

00:07:42.194 --> 00:07:43.896
because they stopped talking
and they were,

00:07:43.896 --> 00:07:45.231
like, they were shocked.

00:07:45.231 --> 00:07:47.199
I guess that's
the way you would be

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:50.002
if a stranger came tumbling
out of the woods

00:07:50.002 --> 00:07:52.738
and interrupted
your conversation.

00:07:52.738 --> 00:07:55.574
So I didn't want to seem weird,
so I just was like,

00:07:55.574 --> 00:07:57.243
"Okay, I'm just gonna
introduce myself,"

00:07:57.243 --> 00:08:00.512
so I walk up to Santa
and I was like, "Hey, Santa.

00:08:00.512 --> 00:08:03.516
"Hey, my name is Steve, and
I'm super excited to meet you,

00:08:03.516 --> 00:08:05.651
and I-I really love
your place."

00:08:05.651 --> 00:08:08.020
And he just stared at me
like, "Does this motherfucker

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.822
think I'm
the real Santa Claus?"

00:08:10.822 --> 00:08:12.825
He probably thought, like,
"Is he gonna sit on my lap

00:08:12.825 --> 00:08:16.094
and tell me he wants a 10-speed
for Christmas next?"

00:08:16.094 --> 00:08:17.663
So I was like,
"Oh, okay, strike one."

00:08:17.663 --> 00:08:19.665
So I turned to the second guy,
the angel-voiced guy,

00:08:19.665 --> 00:08:21.667
and I'm like, "Hey, man,
my name's Steve.

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:26.204
"Nice to meet you.
Um, I-I heard you can--

00:08:26.204 --> 00:08:28.040
"heard you got a great voice.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.009
You going on tonight?"

00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:31.844
And he's like, "Yep!"

00:08:31.844 --> 00:08:36.214
And I was like, "Angel Voice
just left me for dead."

00:08:36.214 --> 00:08:37.382
And I was like, "Strike two."

00:08:37.382 --> 00:08:38.951
So I turned to the third guy,

00:08:38.951 --> 00:08:41.052
and before I could say anything,
he goes, "Hey, I'm Bob."

00:08:41.052 --> 00:08:42.954
And I was like, "Oh, okay, cool.

00:08:42.954 --> 00:08:44.789
"All right, Bob.
Look at us.

00:08:44.789 --> 00:08:45.957
"What a crew we got out here.

00:08:45.957 --> 00:08:47.393
"We got Crystal Meth Kringle,

00:08:47.393 --> 00:08:49.895
"Susan Boyle, and Bob.

00:08:49.895 --> 00:08:51.630
Nice, let's smoke pot."

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:55.233
Except this Bob wasn't
any old Bob, all right?

00:08:55.233 --> 00:08:56.903
This wasn't just
a run-of-the-mill Bob

00:08:56.903 --> 00:08:58.404
you run into.

00:08:58.404 --> 00:09:01.072
This guy, his real name was
Robert James Ritchie.

00:09:01.072 --> 00:09:02.708
Does that ring a bell to anyone?

00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:06.812
Yeah, you may know him by his
better-known name, Kid Rock.

00:09:06.812 --> 00:09:08.580
Yes.

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.450
I interrupted
Kid Rock's conversation,

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:14.053
and he wasn't
fucking psyched.

00:09:14.053 --> 00:09:16.589
He was staring at me like I was
Tommy Lee's dick,

00:09:16.589 --> 00:09:20.726
just like, "What the fuck is
this guy doing here?"

00:09:20.726 --> 00:09:23.495
Now I'm starting
to put all this together.

00:09:23.495 --> 00:09:26.331
I was like, "I interrupted
their conversation.

00:09:26.331 --> 00:09:28.767
"I'm asking questions.
I'm lingering.

00:09:28.767 --> 00:09:32.305
"Holy shit,
I'm the pot blocker now.

00:09:32.305 --> 00:09:34.073
Fuck, how do I get
out of this?"

00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:36.675
But you know what?
I didn't want to get out of it.

00:09:36.675 --> 00:09:37.776
I wanted to stay there,

00:09:37.776 --> 00:09:39.611
'cause how many times
in your life

00:09:39.611 --> 00:09:41.747
are you gonna get an opportunity
to smoke pot

00:09:41.747 --> 00:09:45.451
with Santa Claus
and Kid fucking Rock?

00:09:45.451 --> 00:09:50.122
I mean, if you asked me in 1994,
what do you want for Christmas?

00:09:50.122 --> 00:09:53.125
Smoke pot with Santa
and Kid Rock.

00:09:53.125 --> 00:09:54.626
And maybe instead
of Angel Voice,

00:09:54.626 --> 00:09:56.462
it would've been
the fucking Joe C. guy--

00:09:56.462 --> 00:09:58.130
the little guy that Kid Rock
used to hang out with.

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.700
He would've been
the other guy there.

00:10:03.302 --> 00:10:04.936
So I was like,
"I'm gonna stall

00:10:04.936 --> 00:10:07.306
"and try to wait for someone
to pull out some sticky icky,

00:10:07.306 --> 00:10:09.475
and let's get
this party going."

00:10:09.475 --> 00:10:12.778
So everyone is still staring at
me like I am a science project.

00:10:12.778 --> 00:10:15.481
So I just--I go,
"Okay, what do I do next?"

00:10:15.481 --> 00:10:16.815
So I turn to Bob and go,

00:10:16.815 --> 00:10:18.317
"Hey, Bob,
are you gonna go on tonight?"

00:10:18.317 --> 00:10:19.384
And he goes,
"What do you think?"

00:10:19.384 --> 00:10:20.719
And I just went, "Okay."

00:10:20.719 --> 00:10:22.220
And then all of a sudden,
thank goodness,

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:23.655
out of the front patio,
you hear someone go,

00:10:23.655 --> 00:10:25.323
"Hey, Kevin,
we got more weed!"

00:10:25.323 --> 00:10:26.859
And I was like,
"Oh, that's me, guys.

00:10:26.859 --> 00:10:28.227
I got to get out of here."

00:10:28.227 --> 00:10:30.796
And I turned and started
shame-slopping my way

00:10:30.796 --> 00:10:32.498
back around the front.

00:10:32.498 --> 00:10:35.968
And as I got about 10 feet away,
I heard Angel Voice go...

00:10:35.968 --> 00:10:39.805
[whispering] "He doesn't
even know his own name."

00:10:39.805 --> 00:10:43.876
And they started laughing, and
I was like, "Oh, this is a low.

00:10:43.876 --> 00:10:46.178
This is a true low."

00:10:46.178 --> 00:10:48.848
[laughter]

00:10:48.848 --> 00:10:50.715
So I got up front
to the front patio,

00:10:50.715 --> 00:10:52.984
and everyone was like, "Hey,
did you get to see Santa Claus?

00:10:52.984 --> 00:10:54.386
Did you find him?"

00:10:54.386 --> 00:10:56.021
I'm like, "Yeah.
"Yeah, I found Santa Claus.

00:10:56.021 --> 00:10:57.222
And you could have told me

00:10:57.222 --> 00:10:59.558
Kid Rock was
around the corner, too."

00:10:59.558 --> 00:11:01.193
And they're like,
"Oh, bullshit, Kid Rock"--

00:11:01.193 --> 00:11:02.828
I go, "Yeah,
Kid Rock's right there.

00:11:02.828 --> 00:11:04.530
He's around the corner."
"Oh, fuck you, Kid Rock's"--

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:07.900
I go, "Listen, I understand
that I am a known liar,

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:09.768
"but Kid Rock--

00:11:09.768 --> 00:11:12.437
"I understand,
trust me, I get it,

00:11:12.437 --> 00:11:15.607
"but I promise you,
Kid Rock is 100 feet away

00:11:15.607 --> 00:11:17.709
around the corner,"
and they all went for him,

00:11:17.709 --> 00:11:19.945
and I used that
to slowly back my way--

00:11:19.945 --> 00:11:23.282
and I got into a cab and I got
the fuck out of there.

00:11:23.282 --> 00:11:24.849
And the cab driver's
driving home.

00:11:24.849 --> 00:11:26.518
You know how you start
to replay what you--

00:11:26.518 --> 00:11:29.221
You're like,
"Oh, what have I done?

00:11:29.221 --> 00:11:30.722
This is not good."

00:11:30.722 --> 00:11:32.424
And I'm like,
"How do I make up for this?

00:11:32.424 --> 00:11:35.394
How do I make this better?"
And I go, "Okay, oh."

00:11:35.394 --> 00:11:36.795
I text my friend
Chris Porter.

00:11:36.795 --> 00:11:38.864
Chris Porter, comedian--
very funny comedian.

00:11:38.864 --> 00:11:41.967
He's also great friends
with Kid Rock, and I texted him,

00:11:41.967 --> 00:11:44.970
and I was like, "Dude,
I think I just met Kid Rock,

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:49.474
"and it didn't go well at all,
and just please let him know

00:11:49.474 --> 00:11:52.478
that I am not
mentally challenged."

00:11:52.478 --> 00:11:55.414
And I went to be feeling
much better about myself,

00:11:55.414 --> 00:11:56.815
and I woke up
in the morning

00:11:56.815 --> 00:11:59.051
to a text message
from Chris Porter.

00:11:59.051 --> 00:12:01.987
It was a screen grab,
and he had cut and paste

00:12:01.987 --> 00:12:06.959
exactly what I had sent to him
and sent it to Kid Rock,

00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:10.596
and Kid Rock wrote back--
I shit you not--

00:12:10.596 --> 00:12:14.733
on my sons' lives,
"Yes, he is, period."

00:12:14.733 --> 00:12:17.569
[laughter,
cheers, and applause]

00:12:17.569 --> 00:12:19.905
And I can't say
I disagree.

00:12:19.905 --> 00:12:22.675
Thank you guys very much.
Thank you.
