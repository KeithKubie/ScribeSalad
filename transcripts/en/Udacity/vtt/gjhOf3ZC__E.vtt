00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.439
Both user feedback and the UX review
are examples of user research.

00:00:04.439 --> 00:00:08.849
A whole set of techniques used to
understand what users are experiencing,

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.055
and how we can use that information
to help build the best app possible.

00:00:13.055 --> 00:00:17.950
In general, we can split user research
into two styles, quantitative and

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.900
qualitative.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.330
Quantitative user research produces
data in the form of numbers.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.557
How many users signed in, or
how long people spend in your app?

00:00:26.557 --> 00:00:31.467
In many cases, this data's captured
indirectly via analytics tools

00:00:31.467 --> 00:00:36.720
that can aggregate data
automatically across all your users.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.610
Qualitative research, on the hand,
can't be reduced to a simple number.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.600
Instead, the data produced here
is often via direct communication

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.360
between users and the development team.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.270
In many cases, qualitative research
takes the form of interviews

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.650
that are either undirected,
in the form of our UX Review, or

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.559
directed with specific tasks or
goals for the user to accomplish.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.090
For that reason, qualitative research
tends to be better at answering why

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.610
questions, such as why do
users disable notifications or

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.700
why do they like one
interface over another.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.617
We've just touched on only a few of the
things that make up the field of user

00:01:15.617 --> 00:01:16.220
research.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.110
There's a ton more out there which can
help get your app production ready.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.260
For now, let's focus on Sunshine.
