00:00:00.279 --> 00:00:01.112
- [Voiceover] Hello, grammarians,

00:00:01.112 --> 00:00:02.026
and, hello, Paige.

00:00:02.026 --> 00:00:02.859
- [Voiceover] Hi, David.

00:00:02.859 --> 00:00:05.117
- [Voiceover] So, what
are we working on today?

00:00:05.117 --> 00:00:06.469
- [Voiceover] So, today
we're gonna talk about

00:00:06.469 --> 00:00:09.487
the difference between it's and its.

00:00:09.487 --> 00:00:12.274
- [Voiceover] Oh, oh,
that sounds real tricky.

00:00:12.274 --> 00:00:14.473
- [Voiceover] Yeah, but we'll be okay.

00:00:14.473 --> 00:00:15.450
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.955
So, it's, with an apos--

00:00:16.955 --> 00:00:18.854
So, we have these two forms in English

00:00:18.854 --> 00:00:21.399
and they mean very different things.

00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:24.125
So, let's go though them really quick.

00:00:24.125 --> 00:00:28.392
So, it's with an apostrophe
is a contraction, right?

00:00:28.392 --> 00:00:30.090
What is it a contraction of?

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.059
- [Voiceover] It is or it has.

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.730
- [Voiceover] As in, it's
a lovely day outside.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.950
Or, for it has, like it's been,

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.410
it has been one week since
you looked at cheese.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.199
- [Voiceover] (laughing)
Sad, it's been a sad week.

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:45.668
- [Voiceover] It's been a sad week.

00:00:45.668 --> 00:00:46.915
As opposed to its.

00:00:46.915 --> 00:00:48.291
Can you walk me through its.

00:00:48.291 --> 00:00:52.282
- [Voiceover] So, its
is a possessive pronoun.

00:00:52.282 --> 00:00:54.178
And it's a little
confusing 'cause possessive

00:00:54.178 --> 00:00:56.816
usually uses an apostrophe, too.

00:00:56.816 --> 00:01:00.649
But possessive pronouns
don't use apostrophes.

00:01:02.551 --> 00:01:04.034
So, you would say something like,

00:01:04.034 --> 00:01:07.431
I like rib-eye steak
because of its rich flavor.

00:01:07.431 --> 00:01:09.731
- [Voiceover] That's a
pretty grody-looking steak.

00:01:09.731 --> 00:01:12.038
- [Voiceover] (laughs) I
know, pink and green is

00:01:12.038 --> 00:01:15.271
not how you want your steak to look.

00:01:15.271 --> 00:01:17.490
- [Voiceover] So, we frankly just used

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.657
its where we would use his
or her or their or our.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.203
You would use its.

00:01:24.203 --> 00:01:27.103
- [Voiceover] Right, it's just
that it's not a person, so.

00:01:27.103 --> 00:01:27.936
- [Voiceover] So, if I were asking you,

00:01:27.936 --> 00:01:29.983
can I borrow your book?

00:01:29.983 --> 00:01:32.109
That's kinda the same thing as

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:35.944
I like rib-eye steak
because of its flavor.

00:01:35.944 --> 00:01:37.719
- [Voiceover] Right, it's showing that

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:39.742
the flavor belongs to the steak

00:01:39.742 --> 00:01:41.788
just like the book belongs to me.

00:01:41.788 --> 00:01:42.857
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:01:42.857 --> 00:01:45.138
So, flavor belongs to it,

00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:46.805
book belongs to you.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.590
So, this is the core distinction,

00:01:53.589 --> 00:01:56.057
is if you're talking about anything

00:01:56.057 --> 00:01:59.640
that would be about
possession you use its.

00:02:00.627 --> 00:02:03.036
I-T-S, no apostrophe.

00:02:03.036 --> 00:02:05.477
If you're trying to contract something,

00:02:05.477 --> 00:02:08.673
it is or it has, like
it's a lovely day outside

00:02:08.673 --> 00:02:11.140
or it's been one week
since you looked at cheese.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.980
Then you would use I-T apostrophe S

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.496
'cause it's a contraction,
you're trying to

00:02:15.496 --> 00:02:18.599
cram more information into
this one little phrase.

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.163
- [Voiceover] Precisely.

00:02:20.163 --> 00:02:21.645
- [Voiceover] Sweet.

00:02:21.645 --> 00:02:24.378
That's how you choose
between I-T apostrophe S

00:02:24.378 --> 00:02:26.378
and I-T no apostrophe S.

00:02:27.371 --> 00:02:28.413
You can learn anything.

00:02:28.413 --> 00:02:29.246
David out.

00:02:29.246 --> 00:02:30.183
- [Voiceover] Paige out.
