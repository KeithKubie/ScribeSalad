Hey it's me Destin. So here's the deal. If you watch this video it has

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.070
the potential to change every day of your life for the rest of your life, however,

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.090
you also have the potential to think about me, and whoever sent you this video, every day

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.100
when you're alone and half naked. So I'm going to give you three seconds

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.730
to think about this.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.140
This is one of those things that affects billions of people all over the world

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.150
but nobody talks about it. At least not in an intelligent respectful way.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.210
In 1895 there was a paper published by the London Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.220
by a guy named A. M. Worthington. It had to do with splashes, so after

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.440
reading that, and looking at some work by a guy named Weber, I got to thinking.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.220
Is there a way we can eliminate what's known as a Worthington jet? Or as I like to call it...

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.360
poop splash.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.620
OK if you imagine in your head right now if you were to drop a rock in water,

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.670
what happens is a cavity opens up and it's air, and all that air

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.680
has nowhere to go so it slaps back together because there's a discontinuity in pressure.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.500
Now if you break it down, surface tension is force per unit length.

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.810
(Destin) Nice goggles.
- (Sister- Briley) Thumbs up for science.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.850
(Sister) Sample A. What do you think?
(Destin) [laughs] I don't know

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.890
about you but I have never made anything like that with my body.
(Sis) Well I did make

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.950
more samples, but it just depends on how much tolerance you have.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.980
(Destin) What does tolerance mean?
(Sis) Tolerance for accuracy if you will.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.010
(Destin) I think we need to scrub accuracy and go for more realism.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.560
(Sis) Hey Dest I got the uh..
(Destin) What's up? We got number two here?

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.260
(Destin) Are those beads?

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.200
(Sis) Technically.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.210
3..2..1.. drop the deuce

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.250
[music]

00:01:51.270 --> 00:02:01.310
 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.380
Pinch the loaf in 3..2..1..

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.570
What can we do to eliminate this?

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.650
The answer is, vary the surface tension. All you have to do

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.700
is grab a piece of toilet paper that's already in the bathroom with you

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.730
and lay it on the surface. I like to use

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.760
four pieces so that it touches each side. That way it stays in one position.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.840
[music]

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.900
It totally caught all the bubbles...

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.920
See that?

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.960
[music]

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.020
(Destin) There you go. That fun?
(Daughter) Are you potty training big people?

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.020
(Destin) Yesss. [laugh]

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.050
[music]

00:03:29.070 --> 00:04:10.980
        

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.290
Alright. In summary, I hope you don't think we were being rude or crude or anything

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.340
like that, we're just not that kind of people, we don't uh..
(Sis) Very nice. [laugh]

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.350
This affected billions of people and nobody talks about it. Why don't they talk about it?

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.380
I don't know, but you're gonna go home and try it and you're gonna...

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.430
You're welcome.
(Destin) Don't even act like you're not gonna try it.
(Sis) What we need you

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.480
to do is subscribe if you learned, actually, something.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.510
- And probably better, send it to your friends to weird them out.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.570
Cause I think this is pretty weird.
- Me too.
- It's pretty weird but it was pretty awesome.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.640
- If you would like to click on the cat to subscribe...

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.670
Can you make that happen?
- I can make that happen.
- Awesome. Do that! Click on the cat!

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.790
(Destin) Send this to your friends, word of mouth, so they'll think about you every time they're uh..
(Sister) He's Destin,

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.800
You're getting Smarter Every Day. That's it.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.810
You're making fun of me...
