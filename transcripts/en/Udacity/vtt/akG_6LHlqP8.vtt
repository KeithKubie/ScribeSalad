00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The answer is N must be an even digit because D plus D, no matter what D is,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
that's equal to 2 times D, so N must be even.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Human problem solvers would continue on like that,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
making inferences from what they know about the rules of arithmetic

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
to figure out what each letter should be.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
In the end we come up with one of two possible solutions.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Either 655 plus 655 equals 1310

00:00:36.000 --> 09:59:59.000
or 855 plus 855 equals 1710.
