it's easy to look past what's right in
front of you and not accept your current

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769
front of you and not accept your current
 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:14.210
front of you and not accept your current
situation

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220
situation
 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.790
situation
and think that you don't have enough and

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800
and think that you don't have enough and
 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.410
and think that you don't have enough and
that you're only ever going to be happy

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420
that you're only ever going to be happy
 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.330
that you're only ever going to be happy
if you achieve other things in the

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340
if you achieve other things in the
 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.100
if you achieve other things in the
future and if you maintain that

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110
future and if you maintain that
 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.080
future and if you maintain that
viewpoint throughout life you'll

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090
viewpoint throughout life you'll
 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.910
viewpoint throughout life you'll
probably never be fully happy because

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920
probably never be fully happy because
 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.170
probably never be fully happy because
you're always trying to achieve

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180
you're always trying to achieve
 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.420
you're always trying to achieve
something and once you achieve it it's

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430
something and once you achieve it it's
 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.040
something and once you achieve it it's
like what's the next thing and I can

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050
like what's the next thing and I can
 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.510
like what's the next thing and I can
totally understand that because that's

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520
totally understand that because that's
 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.220
totally understand that because that's
actually the exact type of person that I

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230
actually the exact type of person that I
 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.260
actually the exact type of person that I
am I always feel like I have to do

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270
am I always feel like I have to do
 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.520
am I always feel like I have to do
something better than what I've done

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530
something better than what I've done
 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.820
something better than what I've done
before and that's a good mentality you

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830
before and that's a good mentality you
 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.430
before and that's a good mentality you
know if you're an artist or someone who

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440
know if you're an artist or someone who
 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.950
know if you're an artist or someone who
just really wants to work really hard

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:44.960
just really wants to work really hard
 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.500
just really wants to work really hard
there's this drive to want to always be

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510
there's this drive to want to always be
 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.240
there's this drive to want to always be
better than you were before and and

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250
better than you were before and and
 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.430
better than you were before and and
that's positive but if you take the

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440
that's positive but if you take the
 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.080
that's positive but if you take the
viewpoint that George Bailey has where

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090
viewpoint that George Bailey has where
 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.490
