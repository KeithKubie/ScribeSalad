00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.630
CO2 is created by every living thing on the
planet, but also by burning fossil fuels,

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:05.920
which is causing global warming…

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.330
So, what if we just trapped it all under the
ocean?

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.829
That'd work, right?

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:16.090
Howdy oxygenators, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.490
Every breath you take, you'll be exhaling
CO2.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:24.230
In fact, each exhale contains 100 times more
CO2 than was inhaled, totalling about 2 lbs

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.960
of CO2 per day, per person.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.650
Carbon Dioxide is odorless, colorless, highly
toxic; and apparently tastes "pungent" and

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:31.650
acidic.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.070
Because Earth is a relatively closed system,
so carbon never leaves.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:40.110
It gets burned and then trapped and then breathed
and reused all over the planet again and again.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.420
Most of us probably connect CO2 with breathing.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.700
While we only release pounds per day, industry
releases tons, and if we don't capture it,

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.740
the CO2 will continue to exacerbate the greenhouse
effect.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:56.710
In 2014 we were projected to release 37 gigatons
of carbon dioxide into the air, which is more

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.020
than the planet can absorb.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.290
This is getting serious.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.460
So, scientists are working on ways to filter
and trap this ubiquitous gas.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.120
In the 1930s, researchers figured out if you
bubble air through a solution of a derivative

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.100
of ammonia called amine, the CO2 will be plucked
out, "scrubbing" the air clean.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.530
We've since developed a bunch of other ways
to capture it, but in 2014 MIT developed a

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.990
super-efficient process using electrochemistry
-- electricity plus chemistry -- it's awesome.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.180
The researchers used amines to pick up CO2,
just like in the 1930s, but they added a modern

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.180
twist.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.150
When you bubble polluted air through an amine
solution those guys naturally want to cling

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.159
to CO2.

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:35.159
They love it.

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.400
But then, electricity throws copper ions into
the mix.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.200
If you're an amine, copper ions are way more
enticing than CO2, so they drop the toxic

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.590
gas like a bad habit and pick up the copper.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.100
At that point the lonely CO2 floats out of
the system!

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.100
Yay!

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.270
Afterward, the copper is pulled away from
the amines who have to run through that process

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.270
again and again.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.650
I sort of feel bad for the hard-workin' little
guys, you know?

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:56.979
But back to the CO2.

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.120
So now that we've filtered it, then what?

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.350
Well, because industry faces such strict penalties
for releasing CO2 into the atmosphere, they've

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.180
created Carbon Capture and Storage technologies.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.270
Essentially, most companies take the filtered
CO2, cool it until the gas becomes a liquid,

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.680
and then transport it somewhere for storage.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.560
There are two major ways to do this, one is
straightforward, and one just seems crazy.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.470
The straightforward one is called geologic
carbon sequestration.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.430
In the States, the US Geological Survey has
identified 36 regions around the country where

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.950
the CO2 could be injected into porous areas
of rock between 3,000 and 15,000 feet underground

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:35.950
(914-4600M).

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.010
And hopefully, there it will stay.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.840
The second CRAZY one, is similar, but it's
oceanic carbon sequestration.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.319
In liquid form, CO2 is denser than water.

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.300
So theoretically, if we just, pumped it under
the ocean, the water above it would hold it

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.980
down there like a weighted blanket.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.600
A 2013 study in Geophysical Research Letters
looked at the viability of pumping liquid

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.400
CO2 to the bottom of the ocean, and determined
it would form a lake of liquid carbon dioxide.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.400
Yep.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.530
A lake.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.090
The high-pressure, cold world of the deep
sea would hold it in stasis for perhaps 1,000

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.090
years.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.739
I know what you're thinking, and yes, both
of the ideas have their dangers.

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.720
For example in geologic sequestration the
pressure of the rock above should keep the

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.819
CO2 liquid and it should stay there.

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:21.819
Should.

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.580
But if the CO2 finds its way out of the rock…
global disaster.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.340
In the undersea example, the implications
are also dangerous.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.950
CO2 is toxic, remember, so it could drastically
increase ocean acidity, and deep sea life

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.220
might not survive.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.840
Plus, if it DID leak out… global catastrophe
again.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.030
Look, there's no real, permanent solution
to CO2 problems except maybe venting it into

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.240
space somehow… or simply stopping the release
of so much carbon.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.780
Pollution doesn't just hurt the planet, it
can also hurt YOU.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:04:03.230
Check out how in this video!

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:10.520

come subscribe to my podcast!

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:19.259
On each episode we take 45 minutes to dig
into a topic all the way to the brass tacks.

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:36.469
Here's a taste

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:40.129
Every time we talk about this stuff, I just
want to never use fossil fuels again.

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:41.139
What about you?

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:43.150
Ever feel guilty about your carbon footprint?

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.959
Tell me about it...
