00:00:00.804 --> 00:00:04.543
Voiceover: We've seen that the
payoff diagram at option expiration

00:00:04.543 --> 00:00:09.615
for owning the stock
plus a put on that stock

00:00:09.615 --> 00:00:13.363
at some strike price
that this payoff diagram

00:00:13.363 --> 00:00:16.538
will look exactly the
same as the payoff diagram

00:00:16.538 --> 00:00:21.023
as owning a call option on that
stock at the same strike price

00:00:21.023 --> 00:00:25.069
as the put option plus a
bond that's going to be worth

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:28.110
the strike price at
the time of expiration.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.471
One point of clarification

00:00:29.471 --> 00:00:31.784
and actually let me just
draw that payoff diagram

00:00:31.784 --> 00:00:33.611
just so you know what it looks like.

00:00:33.611 --> 00:00:39.275
So, if this is the underlying
stock price, stock price.

00:00:39.275 --> 00:00:41.076
And let's just do the payoff diagram

00:00:41.076 --> 00:00:45.658
when we look at the value of
the portfolio or your holdings.

00:00:46.135 --> 00:00:49.870
What it looks like is this is
the strike price over here.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.069
If the stock is at the stock
price or anything lower

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:55.476
you make a fixed value

00:00:55.476 --> 00:00:58.077
and anything above that you
get some type of upside.

00:00:58.447 --> 00:01:00.863
So, either if you have
the stock or the put

00:01:00.863 --> 00:01:02.359
you have this type of a payoff

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:04.855
or if you have the call plus the bond.

00:01:04.855 --> 00:01:07.536
The one point of
clarification I want to make

00:01:07.536 --> 00:01:11.402
is that you can only say that this
is definitely true for European.

00:01:11.695 --> 00:01:14.291
For European call options,

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.061
for European options I
should say in general.

00:01:17.061 --> 00:01:18.803
European call and put options.

00:01:18.803 --> 00:01:22.404
Because only in European options
can you know for certain,

00:01:22.404 --> 00:01:26.942
for sure that the options are
going to be exercised on the ex

00:01:26.942 --> 00:01:30.202
or they can only be exercised
on the expiration date.

00:01:30.202 --> 00:01:31.806
If we're dealing with American options

00:01:31.806 --> 00:01:36.609
either party could either on
the put side or the call side

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:39.946
could exercise their options earlier
so it becomes a lot more complicated.

00:01:39.946 --> 00:01:42.737
Normally when we kind of deal
with the mathematics of options

00:01:42.737 --> 00:01:44.806
we're dealing with European options.

00:01:44.806 --> 00:01:50.074
So, even in the example where we
did our put-call parity arbitrage

00:01:50.074 --> 00:01:52.140
where we're able to make that free $5,

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.282
the implicit assumption I made is that
we were dealing with European options.

00:01:57.282 --> 00:02:02.133
That the options could only be
exercised at the expiration date.
