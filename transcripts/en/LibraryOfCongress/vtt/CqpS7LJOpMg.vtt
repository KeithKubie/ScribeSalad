to do research, yes.

But often to write a school
paper, or write a book,

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.640
and actually when I was in
school here in Washington,

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.400
I did a lot of my reseach here
in the Library of Congress.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.240
So it's a great place to come and
learn about all kinds of things.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.560
And in writing my books, these are
children's books, but I wrote grown

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:41.420
up books with the same names,
and I did a lot of my work here

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.040
in the Library of Congress
for those books.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:51.670
But the reason I wrote those
books is because I kept looking

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:57.440
at pictures of day, the Declaration
of Independence or the Constitution

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.000
or things like that and I thought

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.680
"there's something
missing in these pictures."

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.860
Do you think there's
something missing?

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.950
What do you think's
missing in those pictures?

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.980
When you look at the pictures of
the folks writing the Consititution

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.440
or the Declaration of Independence?

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.740
What's missing?

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.800

what might be missing?

Right! There are no
women in those pictures.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.940
None! So my question was:
"Were there women then?"

How do we know there
were women then?

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:57.680
&gt;&gt; Because they were
making stuff for men.

were making stuff for men.

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.360
They certainly were,
all kinds of things.

But, So I was very curious
about what they were doing.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:14.180
Sine it was a very
important time in our country.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.570
It's when the country
started to become a country.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:22.340
And the first thing that had
to happen for the United States

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.060
to become the United States
was that we had to fight a war.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.850
And we had a fight
a war against who?

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:32.350
Who did we have to fight against?

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:36.010
Guys? Who did we have
to fight against?

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:40.380
We fought a war called
the "American Revolution".

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:43.890
Right. And who was it against?

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:45.190
&gt;&gt; Russia.

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:46.490
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: No not Russia.

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:47.940
It was against Britain.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:53.740
And at that point we
were part of Britain.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.040
We weren't our own country.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:00.980
And the men and women who were here
said "We want to be on our own.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.340
We want to be our own country."

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:08.450
And so they said "We're
going to tell Britian we want

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:11.140
to be our own country" and
they wrote something called

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:16.400
"The Declaration of
Independence" to say we're not part

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.820
of you any more we're independent.

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:23.310
But Great Britain said "Nuh
uh, you are part of us.

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:26.270
And we're going to show you,
you're going to have to fight

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:28.170
to be a separate country.

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:33.820
And so they fought us,
and we had a general

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:38.520
in charge during the American
Revolution, what was his name?

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:39.880
&gt;&gt; George Washington.

Washington, exactly right.

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:45.220
And George Washington had a wife.

What was her name?

Cokie Roberts: Her name
was Martha Washington.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:07.870
And every year the soldiers that
George Washington was leading went

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:19.810
to camp and they, it was the winter
time, it would be very, very cold,

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:24.720
and sometimes they
didn't have enough to eat,

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.200
and sometimes they didn't
have a place to stay,

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.980
and Martha Washington
would come into camp

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:35.600
and she an the other officers
wives would sew for the soldiers,

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:40.240
and cook for the soldiers, and
make up songs for the soldiers,

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:44.650 position:56%
and have big dances for the soldiers
so that they would be happier

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:46.560
and they would stay in the army.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.300
And so George Washington wanted her

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.740
to come every year even
though it was scary.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:56.160 position:56%
Because sometimes bullets were
flying and that wasn't a lot of fun.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:01.600
But then, the country became a
country because we won that war

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.950
and George Washington became what?

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:05.250
&gt;&gt; The president.

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:06.550
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: The president.

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:07.850
What number president?

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:09.150
&gt;&gt; The first.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:10.450
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: The
first president.

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:12.620
And Martha Washington
became the first First Lady.

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:15.680
And she had to figure out how to
do that, which was complicated.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:21.030
And then, actually I should
tell you one of the years

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:25.280
that they were a camp during
the war, and this woman came

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:30.400
to visit George Washington and
her name was Phyllis Wheatley.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.520
Has anybody ever heard of her?

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:37.680
Hm? She was a poet, she
was a very famous poet.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.610
And she had been a slave.

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:42.920
She had been enslaved,
and she became free

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:48.090
and as a teenager she wrote
this poem that were so popular

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:50.850
that people in England
read about them,

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:52.590
and people in America
read about them.

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:55.700
So she was known on
both sides of the ocean,

00:10:55.700 --> 00:11:00.020
and George Washington wanted to
meet her because she was so famous

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.260
and wrote such wonderful poems.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:07.910
And so, when he was in camp in
Massachusetts she went to visit him

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:10.930
and he said she was
"gifted by the muse",

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:13.680
meaning she wrote such
beautiful poems.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:20.290
But then he became president, the
country still needed some help

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:26.800
because there is a lot of work to
be done making it, a new country,

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:33.460
and the British came
again and were not happy

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:36.650
that we had become
a brand-new country.

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:41.620
And they were trying to take us
back, back to be part of Britain.

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:43.510
And so, there was another war.

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:48.180
And that one was called
the war of 1812.

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:51.540
And the British came
here to Washington,

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:57.090
and Dolly Madison was the
president's wife, the first lady.

00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:00.840
You know what her husband's
name was, if she was Madison?

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.600
What was her husband's name?

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.200
&gt;&gt; [ inaudible response ]

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:11.350
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: Dr. Hayden's
giving it away, James Madison.

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:15.890
And he had gone out to camp with
the soldiers, to see what was going

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:18.620
on in the field, and she
was at the White House.

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:20.480
And the British were coming.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.290
And she went out on the
top of the White House,

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:26.800
with the spyglass they called
it, it'slike binoculars.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.960
And she could see them
coming in the distance.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.650
And she kept waiting for
her husband to get home,

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:37.690
and she had made a big dinner
for him, and for his cabinet,

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:41.350
and generals, and they were coming.

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:43.540
And she could see the
British coming.

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:46.450
And everybody said to her "you've
got to go, you've got to go,

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:48.320
it's getting really dangerous!

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:52.950
The British are coming!", and she
said "Well I'm not going to go,

00:12:52.950 --> 00:13:00.470
until I make sure that the portrait
of George Washington is safe,

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:03.710
because the British will
do something awful to it."

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:08.160
so she made sure it was taken down
from the walls of the White House,

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:14.680
and safely taken away in a carriage
before she left the White House.

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:18.800
And so she escaped just as the
British arrived in Washington.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:22.040
And they got here and they
started burning the city.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.370
They burn the capital,
and they march

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:27.030
down Pennsylvania Avenue
burning things,

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:29.340
and then they got to
the White House.

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:32.150
You know what they did
before they burned it down?

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:35.320
They sat down in a
Dolly Madison's dinner.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.630
And they said it was
a delicious dinner,

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:42.160
and that they were sorry
they had to do something

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.310
so awful to her, but they did.

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:46.940
And so after they finished
their dinner,

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:48.890
they took a torch and
lit the White House.

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:52.850
And since they didn't have George
Washington's picture to steal,

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:58.150
they stole Dolly Madison's picture
and took it with them as they left.

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:03.220
So then, the country
still had to be a country,

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.840
and they beat the British again.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:10.470
And it was now clear
that we were going

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:14.090
to be the United States of America.

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:19.010
We were going to go on
and be a great country,

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:26.630 position:56%
and we became a bigger country
because Thomas Jefferson had decided

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:30.880
to buy some land that would
double the size of the country.

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.760
Does anybody know what
that was called?

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.060
When you bought all that land?

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:38.280
It's called the Louisiana purchase.

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:43.050
And he asked a couple of
men to go see what was

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:45.300
on the land, see how big it was.

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:51.670
And they had an expedition, called
the Lewis and Clark Expedition.

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:55.150
And they needed someone,
they knew they'd be dealing

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:57.600
with Native Americans
as they went all the way

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:00.360
across the country
to the Pacific Ocean.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:04.720
And they needed someone to
help them talk to the Indians.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:09.360
So they went up to
an Indian settlement,

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.950
in what's now North Dakota,
then it wasn't a state,

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:18.740
and met a man who could speak
some of the native languages

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:21.610
and he was married to this woman.

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:23.930
Does anybody know who she is?

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:26.520
Anybody know who that is?

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:29.890
No? That's Sacajawea.

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:35.770
And she was a young Indian
girl who, right before they set

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:38.910
out on this big expedition
to go all the way

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:42.500
across the country, she had a baby.

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:46.090
So she had to do this
with her baby on her back.

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:47.650
There's the baby.

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:56.370
And as they set out on their
expedition they realized Sacajawea

00:15:56.370 --> 00:16:00.390
new all kinds of things
that nobody else knew.

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:07.400
She knew how to find all kinds of
fruits, and berries, and vegetables

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:12.530
that were hidden in the soil,
so she could help everybody eat.

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:16.410
And when there was a bad
flood, because they were going

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:20.770
by river most of the way, and the
boats were swamped with water,

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:23.590
she saved a lot of the provisions.

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:27.580
And the men who wrote
about it, Louis and Clark,

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:33.090
said she was wonderful, and her
husband was totally useless.

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:38.050
But she had did all this
was the baby on her back!

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:41.260
And she was only probably
15 years old.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:45.720
But she still did this
incredible walk across the country.

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:49.070
But at some point they
knew they were going

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:51.580
to hit big, tall mountains.

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.800
And what would they need to
get them across the mountains?

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.130
The boats weren't going to get
them across the mountain, right?

&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: A
stick would help,

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:06.450
but what would carry
them across the mountain?

&gt;&gt; [ Inaudible Response ]

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:15.460
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: You can
do that for rope climbing,

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:20.890
but what would you ride across the
mountain back in the olden days?

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:23.190
&gt;&gt; A sled?

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:24.570
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: No,
it would be a sled.

00:17:24.570 --> 00:17:26.010
Go ahead.

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:27.310
&gt;&gt; Horses.

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:28.610
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: Horses.

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:30.300
They needed horses.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:35.010
And the people who had horses
where the Native Americans.

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:39.620
And the Shoshone tribe was
known to have the best horses.

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:41.880
And when they reached
the Shoshone's,

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:45.380 position:56%
out in what is now probably Wyoming,

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:49.030
Sacajawea who was a
Shoshone said "Oh!

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:53.820
My brother has become the
chief since I've been away!"

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:58.540
and she was so excited to see him,
and see all of her old friends,

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:03.320
and then she worked it out so
Lewis and Clark got the horses.

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:07.970
They treated them for some
ammunition, and off they went

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:12.900
across the mountains and got all
the way the to the Pacific Ocean.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:17.670
But right before they got to the
Pacific Ocean, they set up camp

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:20.880
and the men were going
to go see The ocean.

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.940 position:56%
And Sacajawea said "That's not fair!

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:29.820
I've come all this way with you,
and I've guided you along the way

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:33.410
and shown you how to go,
and gotten you these horses,

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:35.770
and you're not letting
me go see the big water?

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:37.070
That's not fair!"

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:42.350
and they said "You're right", and
so she went with them to see it.

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:45.330
And then she guided
them back all the way

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:49.220
across the country to
St. Louis, Missouri.

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:53.930 position:56%
And when they got there, Clark wrote

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:57.220
that she should have done a
bigger reward then she got,

00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:01.020
because she had been so
important to what they were doing.

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:04.840
Well she sure should have, because
you know what her reward was?

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:08.250
Zero. So it was not fair to her,

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:11.850
but she had a very
interesting experience,

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:15.100
and then William Clark
helped raise her son,

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:17.870
the baby who had been on her back.

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:24.900
But, while the country was moving
west, and everybody was excited

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:32.070
to have this very brave new country
where they could have a new life

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:37.550
and start off new farms, for
new businesses all on their own,

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:40.560
there were some people
who were doing as well.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:45.590
In some of them were poor,
and some of them were widows,

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:47.270
women whose husbands had died.

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:53.210 position:56%
And some of them were children whose
parents had died, who were orphans.

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:58.000
And the women looked around
and saw that, and said we need

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.370
to do something about that.

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:03.400
And so one of them was a
woman named Isabella Graham,

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.690
and she was a widow
herself, her husband had died

00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:10.480
and she had four little children,
and she moved to New York,

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:13.010
and she opened a school for girls,

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:16.620
and she made some money
on that school.

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:20.520
So that then she was able to do
what she really wanted to do,

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.640
which was help for people.

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:27.840
So she started with other women,
one of them was Eliza Hamilton,

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:31.790
anybody know who her
husband might have been?

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:33.490
Alexander Hamilton was her husband.

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:38.420
And one of them was
Elizabeth Bailey Seddon.

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:40.610
You go to Seddon School?

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:46.080
Yeah. And one of them was Mother
Seddon,, who I'll tell you

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:50.360
about as well, she's got
a big story in this book.

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:53.980
Here she is, so that's your school.

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:57.380
This is the woman that
your school is named after.

00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:02.900
Yeah, go ahead.

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:08.540
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: Her
husband was dead.

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:11.180
I'll tell you her story
just a minute.

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:15.510
So these women got
together and said "we have

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:18.930
to help the children of New York".

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:23.300
So they started an orphanage
which was really hard to do,

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:28.990
because they didn't have the right
to vote, women couldn't vote,

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:31.790
until not even 100 years ago.

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:35.220 position:56%
And this is more than 200 years ago.

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:39.240 position:56%
And they couldn't even own property.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:42.980
Their husbands had on their
property if they were married.

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:48.080
But they were brave, and they went
to the people who ran the state

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:51.180
and said "we need an
orphanage, you have to help us.".

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:56.360
And then they went out into
the streets, and had meetings

00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:00.180
of the public and said "we need an
orphanage, you have to help us".

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:02.190
And they started an orphanage,

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:05.790
and it still in New York
today, helping children.

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:08.980
It's not an orphanage anymore,
children don't live there,

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:11.970
but it still helps the
children of New York.

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:17.990
So even without any rights
these women did incredible work

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:19.870
that has been lasting.

00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:22.490
And, Elizabeth Bailey Seddon,

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:25.630
at your school's named
after was one of them.

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:30.110
So she left New York,
because her husband was sick,

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:35.920
and they went to Italy hoping he'd
get well in Italy, and he died.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:41.110
And so she came back to America,
because she had five children,

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:44.160
and she came back with no money,

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:48.260
and she went to Baltimore
and opened the school.

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:53.310
And the Bishop of Baltimore said
"We need you to open more schools".

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:55.770
And so she opened more, and more,

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:58.840
and more schools all
over the country.

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:03.030
And she opened orphanages
as well, and hospitals,

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:07.330
and she did incredible
work, all over the place.

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:12.660
Because these children and
poor people needed her,

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:14.800
and she just said "I'm
going to do it."

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:18.670
and it was really hard
work but she did it.

00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:25.730 position:56%
We also had in this time some first
ladies, and one of them was the wife

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:32.850
of the president who was the son

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:35.270
of President Adams,
and his name was what?

00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:42.180
Anybody know the name of
the son of President Adams?

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:46.810
Who was also a president.

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:50.070
&gt;&gt; John Quincy Adams?

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:52.290
&gt;&gt; John Quincy Adams.

00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:59.360
And his wife is the only other
First Lady, other than Mrs. Trump,

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:02.870
to have been born outside
of the United States.

00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:09.260
Her name was Louise Catherine
Adams, and she was born in England

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:14.210
where her father was working for
the United States in England.

00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:18.760
That she had never been to America
when she married John Quincy Adams.

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:25.730
And she came, and she was
very involved in politics.

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:29.050
And her father-in-law, who had
then president, John Adams,

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:32.630
she wrote to him and
said "it is my job-- -

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:34.910
my vocation was the word she was--

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:38.480
my job to get my husband
elected president."

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:40.450
Now people don't think
women were involved

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:42.960
in politics then, they're wrong.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:46.810
The women were very, very
involved in politics.

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:49.480
And she worked to get her
husband elected president,

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:51.810
and she succeeded.

00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:57.400
But she also worked with
the women here in Washington

00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:00.010
to help the poor children.

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:04.310
Because after the British had
invaded, they needed help as well,

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:05.930
and there is an orphanage started

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:08.940
by the women here,
and it still is going.

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:13.580
Again, nine orphanage anymore, but
helping children in Washington.

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:16.580
That's Hillcrest.

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:22.350
So these women did incredible
things, and they were very,

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:28.470
very interested in making sure that
the country was a better country.

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:29.770
It was a great country!

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:32.350
But they wanted it to
be a better country.

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:35.340
And so then, they started looking
around and seeing the things

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:39.060
that it's not just people that
were poor, but there are people

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:43.400
who were enslaved, and they
thought that was the wrong thing.

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:48.160
And so they started working
for freedom for the slaves.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:52.420
And then they started going to
those meetings about freedom

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:56.360
for the slaves, and they discovered
that they weren't allowed to talk,

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:59.600
because they were women, and
they weren't allowed to vote,

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:02.470
because they were women,
and it made the mad.

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:06.820 position:56%
And so, then they started working
for women to have the right to vote.

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:11.730
So the two great big things that
have happened in this country

00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:14.870
to make a better country,well,
lots of things have happened,

00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:20.670
but the two great big things:
ending slavery, and making sure

00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:26.190
that everybody could vote,
started very, very early.

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:28.290
And it started with the women.

00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:31.740
So that's why I call them
the "Ladies of Liberty",

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:34.250
because they made this happen.

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:39.450
So I'm really happy to share
them with you today and I'm happy

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:43.510
to take your questions, if
you have some questions, okay?

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:50.040
[ applause ]

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:53.420
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And we also
want to thank "Everybody Wins".

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:57.200
That's a group that made sure
that Miss Roberts was here,

00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:05.340
so please thank Everybody Wins,
you see the wonderful sign?

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:06.640
Because everybody wins?

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.130
When we read together.

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:11.040
So you can ask questions,
and we had questions

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:14.910 position:56%
from Arkansas, and Pennsylvania too!

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:16.250
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: so
that's exciting we'll hear

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:17.610
from the other kids as well.

00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:21.170
So somebody had a question
back here, sir?

00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:24.350
I think he's turned around.

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:26.510
You had a question.Yeah.

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:27.810
Kay.

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:32.840
&gt;&gt; When he was in this book maded?

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.170
When was it published?

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:36.700
Today? Or a long day ago?

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:38.250
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: Not
a long time ago.

00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:40.990
It was just published this year,

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:47.150
and I should have told you a little
bit more about the illustrations.

00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:55.170
Because the woman who drew the
pictures did a wonderful job,

00:27:55.170 --> 00:28:00.960
her name is Diane Good and
she drew great pictures

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.630
of all of these women.

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:07.890
And when she was doing the first
book, this one came out first,

00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:10.790
and it was a couple of years ago.

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:13.640
She got very interested
in all of their writings,

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:18.610
not just what they wrote, but how
they wrote: their handwriting.

00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:21.420
And she got an old-fashioned--

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:25.590
but call a quill, that's what they
wrote with, it had a little point

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:30.790 position:56%
in the end-- and she started writing
with that just like they did.

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:35.020
And she lives in New Jersey,
and then Hurricane Sandy hit,

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:38.980
and she didn't have any
power, so she was in the dark,

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:41.490
and had to draw by candlelight.

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:47.040
So she really knew how they felt,
and she got so interested she said

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:49.120
to me "Do you think we
could we could find all

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:54.490
of their signatures?", And so I
said "gee, that's gonna be hard".

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:56.470
Because it's really
hard to find out things

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:59.330
about women a couple
of hundred years ago.

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:00.630
But, I did.

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:02.330
I found all of their signatures.

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:07.460
So under each of the pictures
is how they wrote their name.

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:12.090
And I teased her that
she did such a good job

00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:14.180
at copying how they
wrote their names,

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:18.650
that she should be a
counterfeiter in her next job.

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:21.870
Okay. Yeah?

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:29.590
&gt;&gt; Will you have the Lady of
Liberty in other libraries?

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:30.890
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: Yes!

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:39.100
It's in libraries all around
the country, I'm happy to say.

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:47.420
&gt;&gt; You were just talking about
all of the important ladies,

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:50.800
are those the only
ladies in the book?

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:53.270
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: So in
the book, the publisher,

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:58.570
the people who publish the book,
one in 10 ladies in each book.

00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:01.490
So I picked 10 for each book.

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:07.020
And so there are people from
different parts of the country,

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:11.190
and there are people of
different races in both books.

00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:12.490
&gt;&gt; Question.

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:13.790
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: Yes.

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:16.750
&gt;&gt;We have a question from
Pine Road Elementary School,

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:18.050
which is in Pennsylvania.

00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:20.290
Remember you guys said
"hi Pennsylvania"?

00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:24.780 position:56%
So lots of kids in the fifth grade
have a question, so Joel, Valentina,

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:28.440 position:56%
acqlyn, Abdullah, all want to know:"
why did you decide to write a book

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:30.970
about women who helped
form this country?"

00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:32.550
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: Well because
I thought it was important

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:33.850
that we know about them.

00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:36.910
You know it's my view that
if you only know about half

00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:40.890
of the human race, and not the
other half of the human race,

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:43.030
you don't know the whole story.

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:49.150
And it's not even really
accurate, it's not exactly true

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:52.610
if you only know about
half of the human race.

00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:54.170
So I thought that it
was very important

00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:58.890
that we know the whole story,
and what everybody was doing

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:05.610
to create this country and make it
the wonderful country that it is.

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:07.040
We have another one from there?

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:08.800
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden:We
actually just have a tweet,

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.980
that Shelley Porter is excited

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:13.960
that Mrs. Johnson's fourth
grade class is participating

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.540
with a class from Arkansas.

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:17.510
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: well
that is exciting,yay!

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:23.580
[ applause ]

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:25.000
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: So,more
questions here?

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.530
Right here.

00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:29.600
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: We have one more.

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:33.060
We have one from Arkansas,
Crossett Elementary school.

00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:36.820
And Cameron wants to know--
who is in fourth grade--

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:39.840
which lady of liberty was
your favorite to write about?

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:42.660
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: The people always
want to know who my favorite was.

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:46.170
In the truth is, I don't
really have a favorite.

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:49.650
Because they were all very
different from each other.

00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:53.830
And some of them would have been
a lot of fun to have dinner with,

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:59.440
I think that, let's see,
in this book I would say

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:02.460
that Louisa Adams would've
been fun to have dinner

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:06.070
with because she had
a good sense of humor.

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:11.150
And some of them I would
have just admired greatly,

00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:14.380
like Elizabeth Seddon,
who I told you about.

00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:18.950
And some of them I would have
been very interested to just get

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:20.630
to know because of the writings.

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:28.350 position:56%
This woman, Judith Sargeant
Murray, wrote way back in the 1700s,

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:31.080
she wrote that women
should be equal.

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:33.880
And so this picture of the
scales, with the little boy

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:37.860
and a little girl on the scales
at the same level, she wrote

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:41.540
and said "Does anybody
look at a two-year-old boy,

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:45.520
and a two-year-old girl, I
think that the boy is smarter?"

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:47.100
What do you think?

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:50.820
Huh? No? No.

00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:52.170
So what happens?

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:56.140
So what happens, in that
time girls weren't educated.

00:32:56.140 --> 00:33:00.100
So she said girls needed to go
to school, and become educated,

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:02.800
and they could do anything
the boys could do.

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:06.910
I would've loved to getting to
know her, and know why she thought

00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:09.850
that so early, when other
people weren't thinking

00:33:09.850 --> 00:33:12.750
about it so much yet.

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:20.720
So different ones I like for
different reasons.Yeah, go ahead.

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:23.780
&gt;&gt; Did any one of them,
in each book,

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:28.050
did any one of them inspire
you to do anything like this?

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:33.670
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: well, actually,
what they've inspired me to do is

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:36.510
to not say I can't do something.

00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:40.890
Because they did things
that are really hard

00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:43.570
with much less ability to do them.

00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:46.810
They didn't have computers, and
they didn't have dishwashers,

00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:50.180
and they didn't have all the
things that make our lives easier.

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:54.030
And terrible diseases
were around at the time.

00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:58.540
So sometimes I'm on could
lose two children in a week,

00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:01.500
and it was unbelievably sad.

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:05.400
And still, they would do
things for the country.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:10.360
Not just for themselves,
not just for their family,

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:13.060
but they would do things
for other people even

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:16.000
when they were having a
very hard time themselves.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.650
So it's made me realize
I can't say "oh,

00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:21.910
it's too hard", that's
just sissy talk.

00:34:21.910 --> 00:34:28.030
I have to be able to say "of course
I can do it, these women did it".

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:31.400
&gt;&gt; How did you feel
when you wrote Ladies

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.990
of Liberty, and Founding Mothers?

00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:39.250
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: it was
really nice to finish them.

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:45.240
Writing a book is hard, and writing
the grown-up books was very hard.

00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:48.910
And one of the reasons it's
hard to read about women is

00:34:48.910 --> 00:34:53.800
because as I was saying
earlier it's not easy to find--

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:56.500 position:56%
I talked about research, remember?--

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:58.020
it's hard to research them

00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:01.280
because people haven't
saved a lot of their things.

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:02.870
How do you think we
learn about history?

00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:06.170
What do we look at?Yeah?

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:07.470
&gt;&gt; Encyclopedias.

00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:09.020
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: encyclopedias
help, but the encyclopedias have

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:11.150
to go to some place to learn.

00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:14.780
So where else might
we learn about it?

00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:18.520
What might we read?

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:24.390
Well I'll tell you: we read
letters, and we read diaries--

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:29.290
see now, their dead, so it's okay
for us to read their diaries--

00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:34.150
so you have to save those
letters, and save those diaries,

00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:37.400
for us to know what's in them.

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:40.110
And for the women, a lot
of people didn't save them.

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:45.450
So you really have to look hard
to find out what they were doing.

00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:49.420
And so, it's hard work to write
the book, but it's really great

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:53.250
to see it once it's done.

00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:54.550
Yeah?

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:55.900
&gt;&gt; We do have a question
from Arkansas.

00:35:55.900 --> 00:36:00.240
We have a different elementary
school, Oak Grove, so Logan wants

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:04.910
to know:"why did they want to
steal the picture of Washington?"

00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:07.000
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: They wanted to
steal the picture of Washington

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.700 position:56%
because Washington was the leader of
the country, and everyone knew that.

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:20.960
So sometimes, still today you'll
see when someone is overthrown

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:22.750 position:56%
in a country their government falls.

00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:28.530
For instance, in Iraq
when Saddam Hussein--

00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:31.570
I guess you all are still
too young for that now--

00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:35.400
he was ousted, they
toppled his statue.

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:41.530
And that has happened in America
during the Revolutionary war.

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:44.570
King George's statue
was up in New York,

00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:49.130
and the Americans toppled
it, and sent it flying.

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:51.600
So King George hit the dust.

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:56.220
And so, the British wanted to
retaliate, wanted to fight back,

00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:58.840
and I wanted to take
George Washington's picture

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:06.410
and show the Americans that their
leader no longer had a place

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:09.150
of honor.

00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:14.370
At Dolly Madison made
sure that didn't happen.

00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:17.900
&gt;&gt; Did all of those
people in the books,

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:22.100
did all of them have
a disease, or...?

00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:24.630
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: no, they
didn't all have a disease.

00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:26.950
But diseases would happen.

00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:31.840
And so, sometimes something like
yellow fever, which doesn't exist

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:37.020
in America anymore, thank
goodness, would calm

00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:40.220
and then people would
get sick like that.

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:44.240
Not everybody had it, but you'd
sometimes have something happen

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:48.230 position:56%
where everybody in town, where a
lot of people in town would get sick

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:52.170
and it would be very very hard.

00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:57.660
&gt;&gt; Jamal's got another question.

00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:58.960
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: Okay.

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:02.200
&gt;&gt; Jamal: why did they want to
take charge Washington's picture,

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:07.780
but why did they want to take
the lady's picture instead

00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:09.080
of George Washington's?

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:13.400
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: so they couldn't
take George Washington's picture

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:18.190
because it was gone, she had made
sure that it wasn't there anymore.

00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:22.650
It was on a carriage
on the way out of town.

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:27.950
But her picture was there, and
they were trying to find something

00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:30.680
that they could mess with.

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:38.100
And so they took her
picture and destroyed it.

00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:43.150
&gt;&gt; we have a question from Avery in
fourth grade, West Fork Elementary.

00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:45.460
The question is:" how
much research did you have

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:47.270
to do to write this book?"

00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:50.520
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: Lots, and
lots, and lots of research.

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:54.900
And as I said earlier it
wasn't that easy to do.

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:59.650
And some of it is that
people didn't think

00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:02.540
that women were important
enough to save their letters,

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:04.380
but some of it is that the women

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:07.900
or their husbands,
burned their letters.

00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:13.610
So after George Washington died,
for instance, Martha burned all

00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:16.670
of her letters between
herself and George.

00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:21.140
Which I could kill her for,
if she weren't already dead.

00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:24.760
We think she thought that
they were just too personal,

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:28.980
and that she didn't want people
reading her personal mail later.

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:32.840
So we only have a very
few of her letters.

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:35.920
But, another woman, the wife

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:42.590
of our second president,
who was John Adams.

00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:49.960 position:56%
John Adams was in the Congress
leading up to the Revolutionary war,

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:56.220
and he then became America's--
the person who spoke for America

00:39:56.220 --> 00:40:01.240
in Europe and Holland,
and France, and England--

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:06.990
and because of that he was
away a lot of the time.

00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:13.460
And so his wife, Abigail Adams,
wrote to him all the time.

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:17.810
And fortunately, he
saved her letters.

00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:22.970
And we have thousands of
their letters to each other.

00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:26.130
And they tell us very,
very interesting stories.

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:34.900 position:56%
And then her son, who was-- what
this tells you, is when her husband,

00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:39.000
hen John Adams was in the Congress
that was writing the Declaration

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.640
of Independence, it
was in Philadelphia,

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:46.560
and she was in Massachusetts,
where the British were.

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.940
And it was really dangerous.

00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:50.900
And at one point, John wrote to her

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:53.420
and said "if it gets
really dangerous,

00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:56.550
take our children and
fly to the woods."

00:40:56.550 --> 00:41:01.010 position:56%
Thank you John, I hope you're having
a nice dinner in Philadelphia.

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:08.410
But her son, John Quincy Adams, who
also of course became president,

00:41:08.410 --> 00:41:12.480
to diary every single day.

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:16.320
And we have everything
that he wrote,

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:19.180
so he wrote about his
mother as well.

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:22.720
And so we can learn
about her from him,

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:25.650
and so that's the way
we do the research.

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:28.940
But it's not easy, it can be very,

00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:33.630
very difficult to get
the information.

00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:37.020 position:56%
Okay, do we have any more from afar?

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:38.660
&gt;&gt; We do have a lot, actually.

00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:40.690
So let's go back to Pennsylvania.

00:41:40.690 --> 00:41:43.150
Pine Road elementary school.

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:46.560
So we have Madeleine who is in
third grade,Pine Rd., Elementary,

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:48.230
just to make sure we got that."

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:50.800
what other children's
books have you written?"

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:53.750 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: These are the only
two children's books I've written.

00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:58.750
I've written a bunch of grown-up
books, the ones with these names.

00:41:58.750 --> 00:42:01.870
And then a book called " We
Are Our Mother's Daughters",

00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:06.200
and a book called "From
This Day Forward".

00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:09.740
And a book called "Capital Dames".

00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:13.130
And then a book about
the Jewish Passover,

00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:16.530
celebrated with interfaith
families "Our Haggadah".

00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:22.850
So, a bunch of books, in all, but
just these two children's books.

00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:26.120
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Kind of a follow-up
question from the same school.

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:29.380
What inspired you to become
an author for children?

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:34.530
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: well I became an
author kind of almost by accident,

00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:39.190
because I work as Dr. Hayden
said, I work covering the news.

00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:43.260
And it's a lot of work,
and it takes a lot of time.

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:47.560
And I really didn't think I
had time to do anything else,

00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:52.660
because I also raised a
family, but a publisher came

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:54.320
to me and said "write a book".

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:55.930
And I said "what book?",

00:42:55.930 --> 00:42:57.750
And she said "oh you are
bound to have a book."

00:42:57.750 --> 00:43:00.360
and I said "I actually
don't have a book".

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:03.310
And so she said "well,
think about it,

00:43:03.310 --> 00:43:06.220
you know you've probably
written some articles,

00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:09.060
and given some talks
that could be a book."

00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:10.530
and I said " well okay,
I'll think about it."

00:43:10.530 --> 00:43:14.360
So I did, I put together
a lot of those things

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:17.520 position:56%
and some interesting interviews with
people and I wrote a book called

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:19.460
"We Are Our Mother's Daughter's".

00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:22.130
And that book did very,
very, very well.

00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:26.100 position:56%
And so the publisher wanted me to
come back and write some more books.

00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:32.100
And so then my interest in
history really got me writing the

00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:33.400
other books.

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:37.920
And then I discovered, even as hard
as it is, and it really is hard,

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:41.170
that writing books is
incredibly satisfying.

00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:45.560
And so, I just keep doing it, even
though I still have a day job.

00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:47.510
Yeah, Go ahead.

00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:52.480
[ background conversation ]

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:54.470
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: Well she's
had a lot, can we just, yeah,

00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:57.000
this gentleman here who's
looking for a question?

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.300
You don't have a question?

00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:00.120
Okay how about one
more from them, then?

00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:03.970
&gt;&gt; How about, we have yet
another school in Arkansas,

00:44:03.970 --> 00:44:09.050 position:56%
this is from a librarian at Sparkman
school in Sparkman, Arkansas.

00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:12.180
The fourth grade student,
Lane, who wants to know:"

00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:14.940 position:56%
when you began writing the book, and
if you'll be writing another book

00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:17.640
about influential women of today?"

00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:21.770
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: Not of today,
because I write about people

00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:27.590
who are alive for my regular
work, and they'll get mad at you.

00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:30.740
So I don't want to write
about living people in books.

00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:35.510
But I probably will
write another book,

00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:40.740
and what's on my mind I
haven't 100 percent decided yet,

00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:42.720
is the fact that we're soon going

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:46.300
to be celebrating the
hundreth anniversary

00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:49.800
of women getting the right to vote.

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:55.640
And not much has been
written about the end of that,

00:44:55.640 --> 00:45:00.370
when women actually got
the Congress to approve

00:45:00.370 --> 00:45:04.390 position:56%
of the amendment they gave us the
right to vote, and then having to go

00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:06.960
after the states, and
get the states to do it.

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:08.260
There's been nothing that's written

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:10.610
about what's called
"ratification" will.

00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:13.350
And so, that's probably
my next book.

00:45:13.350 --> 00:45:14.850
But I haven't done it yet,

00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:18.470
because I'm so busy right
now, with our new president.

00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:23.280
He's taking up a lot of my time.

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:28.010
&gt;&gt; How did you know all
the faces of the women

00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:30.210
that were in your two books?

00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:31.790
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: The faces?

00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:33.440
Is that your question?

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:37.690
Yup.So that's a very good question

00:45:37.690 --> 00:45:42.860
because of course we
didn't have cameras then,

00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:45.870
so there were no photographs
of the women.

00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:53.850
So what we have for most of them
is someone did a painting of them.

00:45:53.850 --> 00:45:57.290
So it's copied after the paintings,

00:45:57.290 --> 00:45:59.380
and that's true for
most of these women.

00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:04.690
But for a couple of them we really
don't have what they look like.

00:46:04.690 --> 00:46:11.450
Like this woman, who was very
early in our history, whose sons--

00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:13.380
her name is Eliza Lucas Pinckney--

00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:17.660
her sons were both in the
revolution, became great statesmen,

00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:20.200
and she was brilliant herself.

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:23.950
When she was 16 years old
her father left her in charge

00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:26.790
of two plantations
in South Carolina.

00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:31.790
So we have all of her writing, but
there was never a portrait of her.

00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:36.990
What we do have, and travels around
sometimes, is a dress of hers.

00:46:36.990 --> 00:46:40.260
So we know how big she was,

00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:43.220
but she started making
silk and made a dress.

00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:46.890
And so we have that, but we don't
really know exactly what she

00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:48.190
look like.

00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:49.490
So it's a very good question.

00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:53.240
And then in this book we have
this very interesting woman,

00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:58.610
Lucy Terry Prince, who we think
wrote the first African-American

00:46:58.610 --> 00:47:03.180
poem, or composed it,
and again she was written

00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:07.690
about in all the newspapers, which
was really unusual for any woman,

00:47:07.690 --> 00:47:12.010
but particularly a
formally enslaved woman.

00:47:12.010 --> 00:47:16.990
But she was brilliant, and she
conducted arguments that she won,

00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:21.360
and she was known, very well known,

00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:23.710
but we don't really know
what she look like either.

00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:28.300
But for the rest of
them we have paintings.

00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:32.660 position:56%
Will thank you also much for
coming, Dr. Hayden I'm sure wants to

00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:36.510 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden:Well we want to
thank Ms. Roberts, can we thank her?

00:47:36.510 --> 00:47:40.040
[ applause ]

00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:45.560
And and we want to thank
our friends in Arkansas

00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:48.010
and Pennsylvania, and
tell them goodbye.

00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:49.310
[ children in Unison ]

00:47:49.310 --> 00:47:50.610
&gt;&gt; Bye!

00:47:50.610 --> 00:47:53.860
And thank "Everybody Wins",
and miss Robert thank you

00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:55.560
for making history come alive.

00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:56.860
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: Well
thank you so much

00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:58.160
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: We hope
you come back again.

00:47:58.160 --> 00:47:59.460
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: Thank

00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:01.100
