1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,880
The Joe Rogan experience, but I think
Pete, I'm Deborah tried DMT. Oh,

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:11,100
I think he's too measured for that. Well,
I think he would want to know. You know,

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:16,100
maybe, I bet he's done a lot of shit. He
does whatever he wants. Yeah, for sure.

4
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:20,690
Czar. How many, how many checks do you
think he's gotten? A stable? Well, I,

5
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:25,380
I will tell you this, I truly
believe this. I think that he does.

6
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,090
He can just sit there and he has
women flock to him. Oh, for sure.

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,820
They love him for sure.
The best looking woman in the world.

8
00:00:32,821 --> 00:00:37,510
He doesn't have to do anything.
Right. This kind of power.
My wife was like, he's,

9
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,610
he's hot. Whoa. I go, but he's,
he's a gangster. She goes,

10
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,390
who doesn't like a gangster? Ooh. And I
was like, Ooh, Geez. I had to walk away.

11
00:00:45,391 --> 00:00:49,130
I was like, oh, it's
uncomfortable. Steal your girl.
Yeah, I'll take your girl. Yeah.

12
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,700
Still your,
your football ring here.

13
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:55,260
But that know the story about
fucking steroidal told me about this.

14
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:00,000
He, uh, who was the football
player where Putin stole his ring.

15
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,190
Google that the owner of the Patriots
wasn't him. It wasn't a player,

16
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:08,580
it was just the owner of the Patriots. Is
that the guy that craft that guy? Okay.

17
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,690
So he had this a Superbowl ring
on, he meets Putin. Putin says,

18
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:15,530
can I hold the dream? You know, and then
like takes the ring off, puts it on.

19
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,280
It's like, hmm. And he
said something like,

20
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:18,990
you could smash someone's
face with this ring.

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,590
And laughed and then just walked off with
the ring and they were like, Hey, uh,

22
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,360
where's the ring? He's like, no,
he just stole the ring. You know,

23
00:01:27,361 --> 00:01:32,340
Harvey Keitel really just took his
ring money ring. No, that's awesome.

24
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,290
This murdering a dick.

25
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,010
So he just decided he wanted it and took
it off the guy's hand and was laughing

26
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,150
and walked off with it.

27
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,780
As the story goes crap hand to the
diamond studded ring to Putin is a bit of

28
00:01:42,781 --> 00:01:45,120
show and tell I could
kill someone to string.

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,300
Putin reportedly said as
he fitted to his finger.

30
00:01:48,301 --> 00:01:51,060
Then when Kraft held out his hand to
get it back Pruett and surrounded by KGB

31
00:01:51,061 --> 00:01:55,440
agents, wordlessly slipped
the ring into his pocket. Wow.

32
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,780
News circulated quickly.
The brain was not meant to as a gift,

33
00:01:57,781 --> 00:02:00,090
which prompted craft to issue
this statement at the time.

34
00:02:00,091 --> 00:02:03,450
At the end of a very productive three hour
business meeting with President Putin,

35
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,240
I showed the president my most
recent Superbowl ring, Kraft said,

36
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,160
upon seeing the ring president,
Putin,

37
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,520
a great knowledgeable sports fan
was clearly taken by its uniqueness.

38
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,331
At that point,

39
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:15,720
I decided to give him the
rings as a symbol of the
respect and admiration that I

40
00:02:15,721 --> 00:02:19,740
have for the Russian people and the
leadership of President Putin, Aka,

41
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,990
I want to live. I want
to love it. I dig this,

42
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:29,160
this muttering. No, I do.
I do have an admiration.

43
00:02:29,161 --> 00:02:33,630
I just think you think he's ever killed
anybody with a ring? Uh, yes. Probably.

44
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,740
He was the guy from beating
people to death. George W.

45
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,370
Bush administration had pressured him at
the time to let go of the ring to avoid

46
00:02:41,371 --> 00:02:43,800
an international incident. Hilarious. Wow.

47
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:47,970
In 2013 craft reneged and offered
some backstory about the incident.

48
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,480
A legging alleging that
the Bush administration had
pressured him at the time to

49
00:02:51,481 --> 00:02:54,000
let go of the ring.
Wow.

50
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,500
It would really be in the best interest
of us Soviet relations if you meant to

51
00:02:58,501 --> 00:03:01,930
give the ring as a present craft
or crawls the White House saying,

52
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,800
I really didn't want to. I
had an emotional tie to the
ring. It has my name on it.

53
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:10,380
Kraft said, I didn't want to see it
on Ebay, but maybe putting ms stuff,

54
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,240
you know there's a language barrier,
so he probably miss. Understood.

55
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:16,180
Listen what he's saying. No, he
didn't shut the fuck up. They will.

56
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,690
You have Russian propaganda agent.

57
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,070
There was a pause at the other end
of the line and the White House voice

58
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:21,904
repeated.

59
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,480
It would really be in the best interest
if you meant to give the ring as a

60
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:29,030
painful, I'm putting a faith, bro.
No, I'm saying shut down your podcast.

61
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,130
He took that ring.
He punked that dude and took his ring.

62
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,040
It's not yet a thief. He's gangster. Yeah.

63
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,140
It's out there pumping like Harvey
Keitel to drop 124 diamonds.

64
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,970
The Great Harvey Keitel. Yes. Tell me
a story. I think it was him. They said,

65
00:03:45,971 --> 00:03:49,540
you know, remember the Akita?
What? No. Um, what's that?

66
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:52,150
What's that fucking that left
him. Nikita La femme. Nikita.

67
00:03:52,151 --> 00:03:56,080
Remember the actress in the TV
show? Yes, I met her once. She was,

68
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:59,260
she went to Russia. Candy
Alexander. So tell ask. Okay,

69
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:02,890
so she went to Russia with her boyfriend.
The Putin likes her.

70
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,610
He used to watch the show all the time.
I heard this from,

71
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,320
I think it was Harvey Keitel.

72
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:14,190
He kept that dude out into another room
and had her out on the balcony talking

73
00:04:16,811 --> 00:04:19,510
to her the whole time.
And basically he,

74
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,800
the guy couldn't get back in and it was
very clear that Putin was making a play

75
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:28,630
for La Femme, Nikita. And then it's like,
you're in my town now. You go over there,

76
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,580
take a seat. I know you came here and take
a seat. I'm going to take what's mine.

77
00:04:33,581 --> 00:04:36,250
And apparently she was gone. I don't
think she did anything, obviously,

78
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:39,940
but you know, let's pretend she
did right there. It is. It is.

79
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:43,810
And he dug her was, oh, Jack
Nicholson turning around, Bro.

80
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,790
[inaudible] boyfriend's not
around. He's not there, Bro.

81
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,930
He's not allowed to be at his table.
You have legs for this.

82
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,370
He was apparently locked out.

83
00:04:51,371 --> 00:04:54,590
He was like trying to get in the room and
there was, sorry. We didn't know. Wow.

84
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:59,650
It's kind of interesting when you see a
guy running a country like that in 2019

85
00:04:59,651 --> 00:05:04,651
that he can run the country
in that gangster fashion
more and saying that he got

86
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,720
people to Sean Penn.
Yeah.

87
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:12,070
It's more interesting to me that he's
gotten himself in a position where people

88
00:05:12,071 --> 00:05:15,760
would actually vote for. So
it technically, he's been
democratically elected.
