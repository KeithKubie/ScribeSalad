00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.674
If we divide this entire left side of the equation by 3, then we just get rid of

00:00:04.674 --> 00:00:09.341
this coefficient in front of the parentheses and we end up with x plus 2. Over

00:00:09.341 --> 00:00:14.064
here, things get a little bit more complicated. Since we're dividing the whole

00:00:14.064 --> 00:00:18.276
side by 3, we have to divide each term by 3. 12 over 3 is 4 and negative 2x

00:00:18.276 --> 00:00:20.517
divided by 3 gives us minus 2 3rds x.
