00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.000
Lee: I moon people on a daily basis.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.270
Anthony: Okay that's fine.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.350
Happy to have you.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.039
Anthony: Hey guys Anthony here for Dnews.

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:14.119
Got Lee Newton here with me from Sourcefed.

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:16.199
More videos!

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.929
So Lee, you know how people blame stuff on
the full moon like werewolves, crazy people,

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:22.240
coyote ugly songs.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.070
Well it turns out that the scientists at the
University of Basil in Switzerland now have

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.499
evidence that lunar cycles and sleep behaviors
are actually connected.

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:31.800
Lee: I knew it!

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.160
No I'm mess during a full moon.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.420
Every time a full moon comes around, my communications
all messed up.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.010
Wait that might be mercury in retrograde.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.510
I oftentimes get the two confused.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:42.920
Science is hard man.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.280
Anthony: Well the University monitored the
brain patterns and the eye movements of 30

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.930
volunteers and they found that even today,
with all our night masks and ambien and white

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.550
noise machines, humans still respond to the
geophysical rhythms of the moon.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.410
Lee: Turns out that round a full moon, brain
activity in the areas that relate to deep

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.329
sleep drop by 30 percent.

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.160
It also took people five minutes longer to
sleep and they slept twenty minutes less,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.230
which explains werewolves.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.340
Anthony: Does it?

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.760
You know also Lee, I told you, werewolves
are not real.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.770
Lee: I think the jury's still out on that
one.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.320
Anthony: I don't know if a jury can be out
because it's kinda science.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.940
Lee: Ok cool.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.160
Crush my dreams a little bit.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.160
That's fine.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.160
Anthony: I'm sorry.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.160
Lee: Eh it's fine.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.160
Can't argue with science.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.750
Now the idea of a full moon being responsible
for synchronizing human behavior has been

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.710
around forever, but that whole electricity
thing tends to get in the way of the moon's

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.710
influence.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.500
Anthony: However this study shows that the
moon really does have a hold on us.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.500
Lee: See?

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.500
[whispers] Werewolves.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.820
Anthony: I just...there's no possible way
for a wolf and a person to coexist in a single

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:43.820
body.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.220
Lee: Can I just have them please?

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.480
Anthony: Werewolves are real everybody!

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.880
Hey if you're wondering where Laci Green is,
she is over on Sourcefed.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.230
That's where you usually are.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:54.230
Where's that?

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.230
Lee: It's at YouTube.com/sourcefed.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.580
Anthony: So go check that out.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.710
If you want to see Laci, she will be back
in a few days and subscribe here for mroe

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.710
Dnews.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:03.400
Lee: Bye
