00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.070
- [Instructor] Joey is training for a

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.060
hot dog eating contest.

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:05.850
The person who eats the most hot dogs

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.040
in 10 minutes is the winner.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.970
If r is the number of hot
dogs that Joey can eat

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:12.170
in a minute.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.890
And N is the total number
of hot dogs he eats

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.100
in the contest.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.820
We can write the following equation.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:18.810
So this makes sense.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.830
He eats a total of N hot dogs.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.410
And the contest is 10 minutes.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.750
So you divide that by 10.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.080
So he's gonna eat N hot dog in 10 minutes.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.170
And so, yes, this will give you the number

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.960
how many hot dogs on
average he ate per minute.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.290
If Joey can eat six and
four-fifths hot dogs per minute.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.560
So they're saying, r
is six and four-fifths.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.250
How many hot dogs does he eat during

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.410
the 10 minute contest?

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.467
So they're saying, "Hey,
what is N going to be,

00:00:45.467 --> 00:00:46.880
"right over here?"

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.050
And so N divided by 10
is six and four-fifths.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.410
r in this situation is
six and four-fifths.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.970
That's how many hot dogs
he can eat per minute.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.670
Now there's a couple of ways
that you could tackle this.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.290
You could say, "Hey,
some number divided by 10

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.280
is six and four-fifths."

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.957
And so you say, "Well that number must be

00:01:05.957 --> 00:01:08.307
"six and four-fifths times 10.

00:01:08.307 --> 00:01:10.817
"And six and four-fifths times 10 would be

00:01:10.817 --> 00:01:14.030
"60 plus eight, or 68."

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.360
So that's one way you could do it.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.190
And you're essentially
multiplying both sides

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.680
of this equation by 10.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.980
The other way you could do it,

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.500
is you could just try out numbers.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.980
And that usually takes a lot longer.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.790
But at least it will
give you the sense of how

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.320
the equation relates.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.230
And, especially 'cause
they have choices here.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.120
It's not a bad idea.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.210
Obviously the ideal one is to just

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.380
think logically through it.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.110
Hey, if something divided by
10 is six and four-fifths.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.370
Then 10 times six and
four-fifths is going to

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.310
be that something.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.830
And that's how you can get 68.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.630
Or, if you want, you could
try out the different numbers.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.810
Look, 65 divided by 10,
is only gonna give you

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.560
six point five.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.090
That's not the r we're looking for.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.180
56 divided 10 is gonna
give you five point six.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.743
Not the r we're looking for.

00:01:57.796 --> 00:02:01.400
68 divided by 10 is going
to give you six point eight.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.440
Or six and eight-tenths.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.030
And six and eight-tenths
is the same thing as

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.430
six and four-fifths.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.970
So 68 works.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.620
45 hot dogs, you divide that by 10.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.120
You're gonna get four point
five hot dogs per minute.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.930
So all of these are completely legitimate

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:16.763
ways of doing it.

00:02:16.763 --> 00:02:18.940
The important thing that you
understand this relationship.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.820
And you understand how
these variables work

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.170
with respect to each other.
