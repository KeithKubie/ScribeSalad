00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:28.590
reminder in the special effects like the
 

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:31.190
reminder in the special effects like the
movie did that kind of gets lost no you

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.200
movie did that kind of gets lost no you
 

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.750
movie did that kind of gets lost no you
know I don't know how you feel but they

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:32.760
know I don't know how you feel but they
 

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.160
know I don't know how you feel but they
and exact thing that I thought the movie

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:34.170
and exact thing that I thought the movie
 

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:35.660
and exact thing that I thought the movie
did really well was I really do believe

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:35.670
did really well was I really do believe
 

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:37.700
did really well was I really do believe
that a half left no I it's fine cuz it's

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:37.710
that a half left no I it's fine cuz it's
 

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:39.320
that a half left no I it's fine cuz it's
almost the exact opposite with me I felt

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:39.330
almost the exact opposite with me I felt
 

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.210
almost the exact opposite with me I felt
really visually in the movie I thought

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:41.220
really visually in the movie I thought
 

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:42.440
really visually in the movie I thought
they captured the blindness but I

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:42.450
they captured the blindness but I
 

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:43.970
they captured the blindness but I
thought was a very clever way to show

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:43.980
thought was a very clever way to show
 

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.220
thought was a very clever way to show
that it was very nicely done and you had

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:46.230
that it was very nicely done and you had
 

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:48.410
that it was very nicely done and you had
whatever Ben Affleck at the context he

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:48.420
whatever Ben Affleck at the context he
 

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:50.150
whatever Ben Affleck at the context he
played it very blind I mean his eyes

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:50.160
played it very blind I mean his eyes
 

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.880
played it very blind I mean his eyes
were always straight where this guy yeah

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:52.890

to remember like when he's on the couch
with dogs and stuff maybe he's looking

00:10:58.820 --> 00:10:58.830
with dogs and stuff maybe he's looking
 

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:00.290
with dogs and stuff maybe he's looking
around and not to say my people can't do

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:00.300
around and not to say my people can't do
 

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.300
around and not to say my people can't do
that but you know like you said visually

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:02.310
that but you know like you said visually
 

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:03.800
that but you know like you said visually
it's a good reminder when you have an

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:03.810
it's a good reminder when you have an
 

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:04.970
it's a good reminder when you have an
app like just staring off into space

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:04.980
app like just staring off into space
 

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:07.640
app like just staring off into space
which is very good at um I mean bar the

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:07.650
which is very good at um I mean bar the
 

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:10.190
which is very good at um I mean bar the
key is even if a blind person moves

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:10.200

accepted visual trope that that doesn't
 

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:15.110
accepted visual trope that that doesn't
happen

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.120
happen
 

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:19.280

yeah I know actually but but with that

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:19.290
yeah I know actually but but with that
 

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:21.590

because they zero in so much on the

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480
because they zero in so much on the
 

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.260
because they zero in so much on the
listening and the darkness you know

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:27.270
listening and the darkness you know
 

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:29.240
listening and the darkness you know
because he is constantly in this one he

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:29.250
because he is constantly in this one he
 

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:32.570
because he is constantly in this one he
is black and slowing down and he's

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:32.580
is black and slowing down and he's
 

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.700
is black and slowing down and he's
listening and he's taking that time and

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:34.710
listening and he's taking that time and
 

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:37.130
listening and he's taking that time and
for me it's a constant reminder that he

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:37.140
for me it's a constant reminder that he
 

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:38.780
for me it's a constant reminder that he
is wearing the other one again not

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:38.790
is wearing the other one again not
 

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:41.690
is wearing the other one again not
because you only have so much time so I

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:41.700
because you only have so much time so I
 

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.070
because you only have so much time so I
don't necessarily blame it for that but

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:43.080
don't necessarily blame it for that but
 

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.510
don't necessarily blame it for that but
you have to keep the movie going you

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:44.520
you have to keep the movie going you
 

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.160
you have to keep the movie going you
have to get the action scene to get the

fight you're right I guess it's a
 

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:48.620
fight you're right I guess it's a
difference between doing it through a

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:48.630
difference between doing it through a
 

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:50.269
difference between doing it through a
performance and doing it by having the

00:11:50.269 --> 00:11:50.279
performance and doing it by having the
 

00:11:50.279 --> 00:11:51.950
performance and doing it by having the
plot set it up to remind you that he's

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:51.960
plot set it up to remind you that he's
 

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.840
plot set it up to remind you that he's
blind yeah or even and I don't I don't

blind yeah or even and I don't I don't
 

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:55.850
blind yeah or even and I don't I don't
feel like the performance is doing it as

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:55.860
feel like the performance is doing it as
 

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:57.500
feel like the performance is doing it as
much for me and maybe it that's just

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:57.510
much for me and maybe it that's just
 

00:11:57.510 --> 00:11:59.390
much for me and maybe it that's just
more important to me is that I'm not

00:11:59.390 --> 00:11:59.400
more important to me is that I'm not
 

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.650
more important to me is that I'm not
saying it's a bad performance I actually

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:00.660
saying it's a bad performance I actually
 

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:02.450
saying it's a bad performance I actually
think it's overall a very good

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:02.460
think it's overall a very good
 

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:03.500
