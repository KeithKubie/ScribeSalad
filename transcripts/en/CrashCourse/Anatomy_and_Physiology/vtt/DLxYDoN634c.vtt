00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.880
I am so glad that you guys are not five years
old!

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.180
If you were all in, like, kindergarten, the
only way I could teach you about your skeletal

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.510
system would be to sing you that stupid song.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.639
You know, “The toe bone’s connected to
the foot bone, the foot bone’s connected

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.519
to the ankle bone...the ankle bone’s connected
to the leg bone.”

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.480
Like apparently there’s one leg bone.

00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:21.150
For the purposes of teaching college-level
anatomy and physiology, let’s just say that

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.770
that song is … reductive.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.160
Insufficient.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.820
For that song to be at all useful for remembering
all 206 bones that make up your skeletal structure,

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:33.309
it would have to begin with something like:
“The distal phalanx is connected to the

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:38.000
middle phalanx …” and then end with something
like: “the frontal bone meets the parietal

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.550
bone along the coronal suture.”

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.090
And it would probably take like two and a
half hours to sing the whole thing.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.270
But there is way more to know about your skeletal
system than just the names of the bones. In

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.880
addition to bones, there’s cartilage and fibrous
connective tissue that allows them to work together.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.040
And maybe more importantly, if you’re going
to gonna talk about the physiology of your

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.980
skeleton, you have to talk about joints.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.460
Joints are the meeting places between two or
more bones -- and even though it might not

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.420
sound mathematically possible, you actually have
more joints in your body than you have bones.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.780
In a lot of places -- like your hands and
feet -- each individual bone is part of more

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.120
than one or two joints.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.939
And then there’s the matter of what all
that bone, cartilage, connective tissue -- and

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.519
the joints that they form -- actually work
together to do.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.420
And that is … move.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.800
Body movements happen when muscles contract
across joints, moving one bone toward another.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.580
And studying the different types of movements
your body is capable of, is not only pretty

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.040
fun, it’s also one of the best practical
ways to understand your bones and joints.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.280
If you ask me, all of that is infinitely more
interesting than memorizing what goes where

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.069
and pretending like a “backbone” is really
an anatomical structure.

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:38.800
So. Aren’t you glad you’re a grown-up?

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.140
Dont worry, it’s not anyone you knew. It’s plastic, and
it’s a little bit smaller than the average adult skeleton.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.479
But -- other than having me stand in front
of a giant x-ray machine for 10 straight minutes

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.599
-- I can’t think of a better way to walk you through
the major anatomical structures of your skeleton.

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:06.399
Now, if you managed to retain our introduction
to human bones last week, you’ll recall

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:11.640
that anatomists typically divide the skeleton
into two major parts: the axial and the appendicular.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.980
The axial structure includes all 80 midline bones that
form your skull, vertebral column, and thoracic cage.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.140
Starting at the top here, your skull’s eight
cranial and fourteen facial bones form your

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.230
body’s most complex bony structure, coming
together to do some pretty great things, like

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.330
protect your brain, help you see, smell, hear,
eat, and you know, have a face.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.160
The 33 irregular bones in your vertebral column
start with your atlas vertebra -- the one that holds

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.180
up your skull, and is named for the Greek god Atlas,
who held the world on his shoulders as a punishment.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.020
I’m not saying you’ve got a huge head or anything.
I’m just saying that’s what it’s called.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.440
The vertebrae run down from your skull to
your pelvis, providing the central support

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.370
for your upper body and completing the enormously
important job of protecting your spinal cord

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.070
-- the main communication line between nearly
all of your body, and your brain.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.300
Most of your vital organs are protected by
the 12 pairs of ribs and dagger-like sternum

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.540
that together comprise your thoracic cage,
which also provides attachment points for

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.060
your back, chest, shoulder, and neck muscles.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.560
Now, the appendicular skeleton includes your
upper and lower limb appendages and pectoral

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.320
and pelvic girdles that attach to the axial
skeleton at the shoulder and the thigh.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.150
And even though your arms and legs clearly
serve different functions -- unless you spend

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.100
a lot of time walking around on your hands
or picking stuff up with your feet -- both

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.750
sets of limbs share a similar set-up.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.290
They’re each composed of three major segments
-- a common arrangement we see in loads of

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.220
animals all the way back to fish, which anatomists
refer to as “one bone, two bones, lots of

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.570
bones and digits.”

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:32.970
We can’t all be Dr. Seuss.

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.330
And that’s just about enough anatomy for
this plastic skeleton to pay for itself. I’d

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.200
rather focus on the physiology of the skeleton, and
in order to do that, we’ve got to talk about joints.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.960
As is often the case in anatomy, we classify
joints both by what they’re made of, and by

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.720
what they do. Because form follows function, we can't
really talk about one without talking about the other.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.430
So, the structural classification of your
bones is all about what kind of material binds

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.819
those bones together -- like, is it a fibrous tissue
or cartilage, or a special fluid-filled joint cavity.

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:02.550
But the functional classification focuses
on how much that joint can move.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.430
So, for example, you have joints in your body
that don’t move at all. These include, say, the

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.120
joints between the bones that make up your cranium.
These non-moving joints are called synarthroses.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.600
But you also have joints that move only slightly,
like the spot where your two pubic bones meet

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.030
to form your pelvis. That joint exists mainly
to absorb shock from walking and running,

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.210
but it also has proven very handy during things
like childbirth. These partly-moving joints

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.530
are called amphiarthroses.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.650
Finally, there are the diarthroses, which
are fully movable, like your classic knee

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.250
and elbow joints. They’re mostly found in
your limbs.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.650
But if you eventually find yourself in the
business of examining and treating people’s

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.240
joints -- and there are a lot of doctors who
do -- then it’ll be especially useful to

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.190
know the structural classifications.

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.490
Structurally speaking, you’ve got fibrous,
cartilaginous, and synovial joints.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.880
Fibrous joints connect bones with dense fibrous
connective tissue, and are mostly immovable

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.100
-- like those sutures between your skull bones.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.920
As you might guess, your cartilaginous joints
unite bones using cartilage, and are similar

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.030
to their fibrous brethren in that they don’t
move very much, and they lack a joint cavity.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.880
But the family of joints that make all the
sports, and the entire art of breakdancing,

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.510
and yoga possible, are the freely movable
synovial joints.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.210
Most joints in your body fall into this category.

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.490
Although they do make use of cartilage and
fibrous connective tissues like ligaments,

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.139
they’re different in that the bones they join
are separated by a fluid-filled joint cavity.

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:21.460
The cool thing about these cavities is that
they contain a bit of viscous, egg-white-like

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.680
synovial fluid that acts like grease on a
hinge.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.919
Without that lubricant, just running down
the street could cause enough friction not

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:32.520
only to wear out your joint surfaces, but
actually overheat your joints enough to essentially

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.560
cook the surrounding tissue and leave your legs
smoking like a desperate Looney Tunes character.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.580
These freely moveable synovial joints come
in six different configurations that together

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:47.340
allow pretty much any movement your body can make,
from a subtle head nod to a vigorous jumping jack.

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.169
All of which you will find in action at your
typical dance party.

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:53.900
Seriously, though, dance parties are an excellent
place to study skeletal physiology.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.919
I mean let’s just take this from my perspective:
I’m at my high school prom. I’m wearing

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:02.299
a tux that is really uncomfortable and I’m feeling
kind of shy, standing on the edge of the crowd.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.780
Maybe I want to test the waters out a little
bit with like a little hand dancing. Just

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.980
the hand going. Waving my hand from side to
side -- it’s a type of gliding movement,

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.480
one that occurs when one flat bone surface
glides over another.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.620
All these motions use gliding, or plane joints,
like the one between the distal ends of your

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.900
radius and ulna, and the carpal bones of your
wrist.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.520
But say after a while I feel like these gliding
movements just aren’t enough to fully express

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.240
myself. I have to enlist the more versatile
angular movements.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.199
These are the types of motion that either
increase or decrease the angle between two

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:36.930
bones across any plane in the body, like if
I bob my head, or kick my leg up, or raise

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.169
the roof. If people still do that.

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:42.930
If that bending motion decreases the angle
of the joint and brings those bones together,

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.419
like when I bend my arm together, that movement
is called flexion.

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:48.590
When I bend it back, I’m increasing that
angle, and it’s called extension.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.639
And if I continue that motion beyond my normal
anatomical positioning, and it’s somewhat

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:54.699
dangerous, that is called hyperextension.

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:59.590
These motions enlist the hinge joints. Similarly,
my oval-shaped condylar knuckle joints allow

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.199
my fingers to bend and ball up for a good
fist pump.

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:05.760
Now I’m getting super into it. I might like
raise my arms up over my head. Well, the act

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.800
of raising my arms away from my body is called
abduction, while moving them back down toward

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.560
the body is called adduction.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.740
And this here, like, lasso movement? That’s
circumduction -- a combination of all five

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:20.860
of those movements that allow the forearm to move
in a circle while the elbow joint stays relatively stable.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.880
Which really makes you wanna give credit to
those cowboys.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.000
Now if you want to get really serious about
that lassoing and expand it enough to include

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:30.680
the entire arm, the move eventually will morph
from an angular movement to a rotational one

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.940
-- a motion that turns the bone around its
axis, in this case, the humerus.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:39.080
Hip and shoulder joints use a ball-and-socket
design that allow rotational movement, but

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:43.500
the more flexible a joint is, the more unstable
and fragile it is -- which is one reason why

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.260
you see so many dislocated shoulders and hip
replacements.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:50.220
And it’s worth pointing out that some movements
are just special and unique and weird, and

00:07:50.229 --> 00:07:54.979
only occur in a few select joints -- especially
in your hands, feet, and jaw.

00:07:54.979 --> 00:07:58.370
For example, your ability to touch your thumb
to your fingertips or give a thumbs up is

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:03.480
thanks to opposition movement, facilitated by your
saddle joint, which makes your thumbs opposable.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:08.320
The pivot joint between your radius and ulna
allow you to rotate your palm forward or anteriorly

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:13.500
in a motion called supination, and turning
it backward or posteriorly is called pronation.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:17.980
So that’s what I like to think is the more grown-up
approach to teaching you about your skeleton.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:21.620
It did not involve any singing, but yes, a
little dancing.

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:26.280
And it was worth it, because you learned about
the basic structure of your skeletal system,

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:30.420
including the arrangements of both the axial
and the appendicular skeleton. And we went

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:34.220
over the structural and functional classifications
of your joints, along with the major types

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:36.240
of movement that they make possible.
