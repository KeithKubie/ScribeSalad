00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:02.400
[dramatic music]

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.967
Cameras aren't working.

00:00:03.967 --> 00:00:07.066
That's getting
super frustrating.

00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:09.133
MAN 1: This is what it's
like on "Life Below Zero."

00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:10.533
NATHANIEL STEPHENS:
Camera's already down.

00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:13.734
Tough conditions all
around to film in.

00:00:13.734 --> 00:00:16.333
CROFTON DIACK: No heat,
no power, no anything.

00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:17.567
[groans]

00:00:17.567 --> 00:00:19.200
Won't even turn on.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.767
CROFTON DIACK: I've
fallen too many times.

00:00:22.767 --> 00:00:27.767
We have bad winds and it's just
a typical day in the Arctic.

00:00:27.767 --> 00:00:29.633
NATHANIEL STEPHENS: Making
the best of what we got.

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:38.367
[serene music]

00:00:38.367 --> 00:00:41.500
This is an exciting time
getting ready for our big trip

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.367
in the most remote
location you can think of.

00:00:47.667 --> 00:00:48.800
CROFTON DIACK: Wow.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.800
The cache is still standing.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.233
MAN 1: This is just one
of our cycles in the year.

00:00:53.233 --> 00:00:54.533
The time to come
down here is now.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.100
We're getting ready to
follow the Hailstones out

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.934
to their hunting
grounds in Kiwalik.

00:01:02.934 --> 00:01:06.100
We're here in Noorvik right now,
so that's about 90 miles away

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.400
by snowmachine, so there's a lot
of prep that goes into getting

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.734
ready for the journey.

00:01:10.734 --> 00:01:12.533
A lot of things up here when
we're filming in the winter

00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:13.233
start with digging.

00:01:16.433 --> 00:01:18.800
This CONEX trailer where
we store our gear here

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.100
Noorvik has pretty well
drifted in with snow.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.700
Hoping to get it dug out and
get one of our sleds out so

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.300
I can load it up and
start the packing process

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.200
for our big trip to Kiwalik.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.900
So I've get the
door cleared out.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.600
And hopefully, it should be
enough clearance to open it up

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.133
and get the sled out of here.

00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:38.066
Seems like we have
a frozen lock.

00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:39.367
That happens from time to time.

00:01:39.367 --> 00:01:41.800
I think some water got into
the mechanism of the lock

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.166
and froze.

00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:45.900
Just putting a little bit of
lighter heat on it in the past

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.767
has worked pretty well for us.

00:01:47.767 --> 00:01:49.200
See if that'll do the trick.

00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:53.367
[triumphant music]
Yes.

00:01:53.367 --> 00:01:54.066
Got it.

00:01:57.133 --> 00:01:58.600
All right.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.867
Here's the sled I
was looking for.

00:02:00.867 --> 00:02:02.533
So this is our crew flat sled.

00:02:02.533 --> 00:02:07.200
It's very similar to a sled
that the Hailstones use to move

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.734
their gear around as well.

00:02:08.734 --> 00:02:13.166
Pretty common in this area for
moving stuff in the wintertime.

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:15.800
In addition to keeping the
crew safe and well-fed,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.767
my role on the crew is
taking care of logistics.

00:02:19.767 --> 00:02:22.033
So when we go out and
do a remote shoot,

00:02:22.033 --> 00:02:25.400
it's my job to make sure we have
everything we need to set up

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.066
a little city that
we can live and work

00:02:27.066 --> 00:02:28.867
out of when we're out there.

00:02:28.867 --> 00:02:31.600
I can't run down to the corner
store if I forget something,

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.033
so I need to make sure I've got
everything that we need to set

00:02:35.033 --> 00:02:38.867
up a comfortable little
tent city where we can live,

00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:43.200
and eat, and sleep, and work,
and enjoy ourselves as well

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.266
out there.

00:02:44.266 --> 00:02:46.266
So this is something
that we use whenever

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:48.133
we're working remotely.

00:02:48.133 --> 00:02:51.834
It's a big heavy-duty
double wall canvas tent.

00:02:51.834 --> 00:02:54.633
It weighs a ton, but
it's really ready

00:02:54.633 --> 00:02:55.867
for an arctic environment.

00:02:55.867 --> 00:02:57.233
It can handle big wind.

00:02:57.233 --> 00:03:00.567
It's a good spot to set up all
of our camera equipment inside,

00:03:00.567 --> 00:03:02.033
also to set up a kitchen.

00:03:02.033 --> 00:03:03.633
That's where the crew
hangs out and sleeps,

00:03:03.633 --> 00:03:06.800
so it's really important that we
have something good for tents.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.767
Hailstones like to move around
depending on where the game is

00:03:09.767 --> 00:03:11.300
or what the story
is we're working on.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.867
I need to also be ready to set
up a mobile camping situation.

00:03:16.867 --> 00:03:19.834
Heat is going to be really
important out there.

00:03:19.834 --> 00:03:22.033
I've got a couple
different systems for that.

00:03:22.033 --> 00:03:26.900
A very crucial part of our gear
here is this gas generator.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.433
Electricity is very important
when you're making television.

00:03:30.433 --> 00:03:33.900
Obviously, we have to charge
all of the camera batteries

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.100
and keep all of the other
equipment functioning.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.500
This is our toilet.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.867
And we practice leave no trace
camping out there, which means

00:03:40.867 --> 00:03:43.900
we want to leave the Arctic
environment just like we

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.633
found it or even better.

00:03:45.633 --> 00:03:48.000
So we pack it in and
we pack it all out,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.066
including our human waste.

00:03:51.066 --> 00:03:54.934
And I put a little foam seat on
there to keep everyone's butt

00:03:54.934 --> 00:03:56.133
warm in 30 below.

00:03:56.133 --> 00:03:58.667
I packed a lot of
food ahead of time.

00:03:58.667 --> 00:04:02.667
When we're out spending a long
day filming and then coming

00:04:02.667 --> 00:04:05.200
back to camp, it's not always
practical to make a big dinner,

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.867
so I've prepared a lot of meals
ahead of time and frozen them.

00:04:09.867 --> 00:04:12.133
And they'll travel
out with us and make

00:04:12.133 --> 00:04:15.266
the cooking job a little bit
easier once we get out there.

00:04:15.266 --> 00:04:16.333
So I've gone through the list.

00:04:16.333 --> 00:04:17.700
I've got all my essentials.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.433
I'm going to pack all this stuff
along with our personal gear

00:04:20.433 --> 00:04:23.100
and all of our camera
gear on our four sleds,

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.367
and we're going to head out for
our big journey to the Kiwalik

00:04:25.367 --> 00:04:26.967
following the Hailstones.

00:04:26.967 --> 00:04:29.967
CROFTON DIACK: We're
Eagle Crew out.

00:04:29.967 --> 00:04:34.233
I think this is
our last year load.

00:04:34.233 --> 00:04:37.500
[tense music]

00:04:39.033 --> 00:04:43.033
MAN 2: It's fascinating to watch
the workings of mother nature

00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:46.066
on this massive river
throughout the year.

00:04:46.066 --> 00:04:49.066
MAN 3: When you live out
here, we don't have roads.

00:04:49.066 --> 00:04:52.200
In Alaska, most of the rivers
are the-- are the highways,

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.200
and we live along an interstate.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.734
[relaxing music]

00:05:00.934 --> 00:05:03.867
Our last ride is
with the helicopter,

00:05:03.867 --> 00:05:06.333
so we're going to
sling all of our stuff

00:05:06.333 --> 00:05:09.867
over to the bluff 16 miles
downstream on the Yukon River,

00:05:09.867 --> 00:05:14.633
which is frozen right now, and
then head it to camp and film

00:05:14.633 --> 00:05:15.333
the ice breakup.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.000
This is all of our supplies
for the next two weeks.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.867
[grunts]

00:05:24.867 --> 00:05:28.033
That's already
200, 300 pounds.

00:05:28.033 --> 00:05:29.200
CROFTON DIACK:
Let's keep loading

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.133
and wait for this helicopter.

00:05:33.133 --> 00:05:34.533
MAN 4: Thank you.

00:05:34.533 --> 00:05:37.667
500 pounds of
gear ready to go.

00:05:37.667 --> 00:05:39.667
[helicopter whirring]

00:05:53.266 --> 00:05:54.967
MAN 4: I think those
are going to go inside.

00:06:05.533 --> 00:06:07.333
There goes the load.

00:06:07.333 --> 00:06:08.533
There goes the load.

00:06:08.533 --> 00:06:10.300
Aye, aye, aye.
