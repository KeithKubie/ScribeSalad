the<00:18:15.250><c> that's</c><00:18:15.640><c> it</c><00:18:15.850><c> so</c><00:18:16.570><c> I</c><00:18:16.600><c> think</c><00:18:16.929><c> some</c><00:18:17.260><c> of</c><00:18:17.289><c> them</c>

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:17.500 align:start position:0%
the that's it so I think some of them
 

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
the that's it so I think some of them
maybe<00:18:17.649><c> we</c><00:18:18.159><c> probably</c><00:18:18.610><c> at</c><00:18:18.700><c> the</c><00:18:18.820><c> time</c><00:18:19.000><c> wouldn't</c>

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:19.210 align:start position:0%
maybe we probably at the time wouldn't
 

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:20.430 align:start position:0%
maybe we probably at the time wouldn't
have<00:18:19.360><c> thought</c><00:18:19.450><c> this</c><00:18:19.720><c> is</c><00:18:19.840><c> the</c><00:18:19.929><c> greatest</c><00:18:20.260><c> action</c>

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:20.380 align:start position:0%
just the whole thing just felt like one
 

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
just the whole thing just felt like one
of<00:20:20.410><c> those</c><00:20:20.590><c> studio</c><00:20:21.720><c> created</c><00:20:22.720><c> messes</c><00:20:23.200><c> where</c>

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:23.650 align:start position:0%
of those studio created messes where
 

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:26.790 align:start position:0%
of those studio created messes where
like<00:20:23.950><c> they</c><00:20:24.130><c> over</c><00:20:24.640><c> tinkered</c><00:20:25.420><c> with</c><00:20:25.480><c> it</c><00:20:25.770><c> so</c><00:20:26.770><c> I</c>

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:26.800 align:start position:0%
like they over tinkered with it so I
 

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.250 align:start position:0%
like they over tinkered with it so I
think<00:20:27.070><c> it's</c><00:20:27.520><c> more</c><00:20:27.730><c> matter</c><00:20:28.000><c> of</c><00:20:28.330><c> um</c><00:20:28.600><c> will</c><00:20:29.230><c> you</c>

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:29.260 align:start position:0%
think it's more matter of um will you
 

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:31.260 align:start position:0%
