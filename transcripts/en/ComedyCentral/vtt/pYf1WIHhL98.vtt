00:00:00.934 --> 00:00:02.502
I could only imagine
the cocktail of garbage

00:00:02.535 --> 00:00:04.537
inside your phone right
now, the lies you tell.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:05.505
- Oh god, yeah.

00:00:05.538 --> 00:00:07.507
- I just wanna apologize
to all those ladies.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.442
You're the kind of guy, you
probably ask girls to marry you,

00:00:09.475 --> 00:00:12.111
you're like, "I never say
this, I never say this,

00:00:12.144 --> 00:00:14.347
"but I could legit see
myself marrying you.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.115
"Could a guy like this break
your heart?"

00:00:16.148 --> 00:00:18.184
And the answer is of course and
he will.

00:00:18.217 --> 00:00:20.453
(rock music)

00:00:20.486 --> 00:00:21.554
- What's up everybody?

00:00:21.587 --> 00:00:23.589
Welcome to Stupid Questions
with Chris DiStefano.

00:00:23.622 --> 00:00:25.358
I'm with Rachel Feinstein.

00:00:25.391 --> 00:00:27.627
You can see her special
The Standups on Netflix

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.663
and she's got a good podcast
called 3 Girls, 1 Keith.

00:00:30.696 --> 00:00:31.464
(rock music)

00:00:31.497 --> 00:00:32.598
Alright, here's a stupid
question:

00:00:32.632 --> 00:00:36.469
What's the dumbest lie you've
ever told your parents?

00:00:36.502 --> 00:00:37.703
- Oh, here's a good one.
- Okay.

00:00:37.736 --> 00:00:39.839
- My mom found like a hickey on
my neck,

00:00:39.872 --> 00:00:41.541
just the biggest, dumbest--

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:42.509
- It was like obvious.

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:46.512
- And I told my mother that a
wolf bit me.

00:00:46.545 --> 00:00:48.347
(both laughing)

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.549
- What, did your mom believe it?

00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:50.517
- (laughs) No, she didn't.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.651
She would always say
this when I lie to her,

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:54.554
she goes, "oh please,
Rachel, I lived in California

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:59.059
"in the 1960s, that's no wolf,
that's a goddamned hickey."

00:01:00.192 --> 00:01:01.661
And she would go, "I've
been around the block,"

00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:03.696
which is such a gross
thing to hear your mom say.

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:05.164
Like no one wants to
hear your mom be like,

00:01:05.197 --> 00:01:07.834
"I've been passed around
a couple of times."

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:10.203
(rock music)

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:11.571
I have a stupid question for
you.

00:01:11.604 --> 00:01:12.472
- Okay.

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:13.673
- Did you have a nickname
growing up?

00:01:13.706 --> 00:01:15.608
- Well, when I was a kid,
people used to call me "Mayo."

00:01:15.641 --> 00:01:16.609
- Were you fond of mayonnaise?

00:01:16.642 --> 00:01:17.743
- Well, no, it's like I
was a basketball player

00:01:17.777 --> 00:01:20.179
and I was like the only white
kid, so like my friends,

00:01:20.212 --> 00:01:22.381
like my black friends
would call me "Mayo."

00:01:22.414 --> 00:01:23.716
Oh, then they used to call me
"Gums,"

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:25.351
cause I was all gums, I had
really just,

00:01:25.384 --> 00:01:26.052
I had like, I actually had
gingivitis,

00:01:26.085 --> 00:01:28.354
like it was like a dental issue,

00:01:28.387 --> 00:01:29.789
it's cause my gums were always
bleeding,

00:01:29.822 --> 00:01:31.858
they'd be like "Chrissy
Gums" or like "Horse Face,"

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:32.559
something like that.

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:35.161
- Kids are so extremely cruel.

00:01:35.194 --> 00:01:36.229
They'll find a thing you
weren't,

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:38.498
you never even occurred to
be self-conscious about,

00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:40.133
like I still remember this guy,

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:41.234
like walking me home from school
one day,

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:42.835
he's like, "how come you've
got that little thing

00:01:42.868 --> 00:01:45.171
"on the top of your thighs,
it's like extra fat."

00:01:45.204 --> 00:01:46.372
(both laughing)

00:01:46.405 --> 00:01:47.440
Who says that?

00:01:47.473 --> 00:01:50.476
I've never forgot Wesley's
dumb sentence for the,

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.378
you know, still now, when
I look in the mirror,

00:01:52.411 --> 00:01:53.846
I'm like, "ah, that little extra
fat

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:55.148
"that Wesley didn't care for."

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:56.516
- Little cherry of fat on top.

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.617
- And also, who insults someone

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.885
and then makes them answer for
it?

00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:00.486
He's like, "how come you got
that?"

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:01.354
- Yeah, yeah.

00:02:01.387 --> 00:02:02.889
(rock music)

00:02:02.922 --> 00:02:03.723
- Next stupid question:

00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:05.658
What's the weirdest thing you've
seen

00:02:05.691 --> 00:02:06.525
in somebody else's home?

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:08.661
- Well, my friend that I grew up
with,

00:02:08.694 --> 00:02:12.431
her dad had a toothpick
dispenser next to his uh,

00:02:12.464 --> 00:02:14.433
couch and sometimes he
wouldn't be able to find

00:02:14.466 --> 00:02:16.235
his toothpicks when I'd go
over there and he would go,

00:02:16.268 --> 00:02:17.637
"where the hell's my 'spencer?

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.906
"Where in the hell's my
'spencer?"

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:20.807
That's all he wanted,

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.674
he just wanted his toothpick
dispenser.

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:22.642
- Now, would that, as a young
woman,

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:25.912
make you feel extremely
uncomfortable to be

00:02:25.945 --> 00:02:27.914
alone in the house with that
father?

00:02:27.947 --> 00:02:31.951
- I remember one time, he
was on his way to 7-11,

00:02:31.984 --> 00:02:33.519
and he goes, "you girls want
anything?"

00:02:33.552 --> 00:02:35.588
It was just me and my
friend and I was like,

00:02:35.621 --> 00:02:38.291
"no, I'm okay," and he
goes, "I'm just gonna get me

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:40.326
"a hooker and a hotdog" (both
laughing).

00:02:41.227 --> 00:02:42.562
It was an interesting
thing to choose to tell

00:02:42.595 --> 00:02:43.696
like a couple of 10 year olds.

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:44.931
- A hooker and a hotdog.

00:02:44.964 --> 00:02:46.966
That's a good t-shirt,
Hooker and a Hotdog.

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:49.835
(rock music)

00:02:49.868 --> 00:02:50.970
Next stupid question:

00:02:51.003 --> 00:02:53.272
chunky heels or chunky guys?

00:02:53.305 --> 00:02:54.907
- I like a chunky guy.
- Nice.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.609
- Yes, I like a little extra
weight,

00:02:56.642 --> 00:02:57.677
I like a little thickness in a
man.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.646
- Yeah, well, your fiance's
a little thick guy.

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:01.981
- Yeah, I like em thick.
- He's in shape, though.

00:03:02.014 --> 00:03:03.749
- I like to see a thick thigh on
a man,

00:03:03.782 --> 00:03:04.883
because I don't wanna be the
bigger one.

00:03:04.917 --> 00:03:07.286
I don't wanna be like Big
Rach kinda lumbering over

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:08.988
and if a guy's a little out of
shape,

00:03:09.021 --> 00:03:11.691
I feel like that makes me
feel more confident, too.

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:13.759
I wanna bring like the
treats to the hookup.

00:03:13.792 --> 00:03:14.927
- Yeah, I got like, I
got some weight on me,

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.330
like to go in the pool, I
keep my shirt on, you know?

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:19.298
Just have my tits get
wet, you know (laughs)?

00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:21.634
- I heard you have
beautiful, natural breasts.

00:03:21.667 --> 00:03:22.835
- Oh, my god, who told you that?

00:03:22.868 --> 00:03:25.404
- People pay a lot of money
for tits like yours, right?

00:03:25.437 --> 00:03:26.505
- Hell yeah.

00:03:26.538 --> 00:03:28.841
(rock music)

00:03:28.874 --> 00:03:30.409
Alright, thank you so much
for being a part of the show.

00:03:30.442 --> 00:03:31.277
Did you have a good time?

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.378
- I did, I did.

00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:33.813
- Alright, so you know, for
being a part of my show,

00:03:33.846 --> 00:03:35.314
I wanted to give you a stupid
gift.

00:03:35.347 --> 00:03:36.282
- Thank you.
- Yes.

00:03:36.315 --> 00:03:37.250
I wanted to give you this.

00:03:37.283 --> 00:03:38.117
- Aww.
- And these are just

00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:39.885
aqua jewelry, like your mother
wears.

00:03:39.918 --> 00:03:41.320
(Rachel laughing loudly)

00:03:41.353 --> 00:03:44.857
We just thought these
would be good for you.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.492
- God, I'm gonna get laid,

00:03:46.525 --> 00:03:49.028
I'm gonna get laid.
- Laid, woo!

00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:50.796
- I got a good feeling.

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:52.365
You know what, I'm worth it.

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:53.399
- Yeah.
- I'm worth it.

00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:55.501
- So, thank you for
watching Stupid Questions

00:03:55.534 --> 00:03:57.970
with Chris DiStefano, my
daughter, Rachel Feinstein.

00:03:58.003 --> 00:03:59.939
- Oh my god.
- Stupid Questions.

00:03:59.972 --> 00:04:01.741
- Uglier than anything I've ever
seen.

00:04:01.774 --> 00:04:04.310
(rock music)
