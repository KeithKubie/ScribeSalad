00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm going to go ahead and add that function to our program here.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Actually, this one works verbatim just like out of the quiz.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Now if we give it a list of points, it will return the URL for the image. Let's go ahead and use that.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
If we have any coordinates, make a URL image.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We've already implemented that function. Let's go ahead and move our comment.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Now we just need to display the image URL.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Actually, we need to make one little change here-- img_url = None.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
If by default doesn't exist and if we actually have some points, we can set it to something else.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Then we just need to pass img<u>url into our template--img</u>url = img_url.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Now we just need to update our template, and we're going to insert our image.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Remember, this is our template. I had a bunch of CSS.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Remember I explained that kind of controls the layout of things.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Then we have all of our HTML. Here is our form.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
We want to display this to the right of our form.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I'm going to do somethings you haven't seen before in terms of getting it to display right,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
but first let's just get the image in here.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
If img_url--so basically it's not None--include our image.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
This is how we do that in the Jinja template language.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Again, I know we haven't covered this in this class, but it's fairly straightforward.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
You just have some text, and you have these little escapes for actually running Python code.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
If the URL is there, include this image. Let's give this a whirl.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I reloaded the page, and you can see below the form we have an image with a marker on it.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Pretty cool, huh? Let's get our image displayed off to the right here.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I'm just going to go ahead and do that, and I'll explain briefly how it's done.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I've moved the image over here. I'll show you briefly what I did to do that.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I added a class to map, so I can refer to it in my CSS.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
You can use this notion of position absolute,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
which allows you to position something anywhere on the page.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I positioned absolute the map to be zero pixels from the right and 112 pixels from the top--

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
zero from the right, 112 from the top. It fits perfectly.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Obviously, I knew the size of the image beforehand when we did this whole URL thing.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Let's see if our program works. Remember we've got this hack in here forcing our IP.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
We're going to have to--probably if we're going to develop this long-term,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
maybe when it's in debug mode it'll chose from some random IPs or something like that,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
but when we put it into production it is going to use the real IP.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Right now, we're just going to hard code some IPs so this actually works in the demo.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I'll go ahead and include Udacity's office IP, and we'll submit some ASCII art.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
We'll have this IP, and let's make sure things work.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Let's add a picture of a rabbit.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
We'll past that in or we'll draw it by hand, whichever you're faster at.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
We submit this--ta-da!

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
It took a little longer to submit because we had to look up the IP,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
but now we can see that we used our office IP, which is down here in Palo Alto.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
We have our old IP from that other IP we faked, which in here in Colorado,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and we can see our rabbit and our cat. Our camel didn't have a location.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Now ASCII Chan is much more worldly.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I'll put this online at asciichan.com, and you call can submit all the ASCII art you love to do.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
We'll see how this map goes. That's it for this lesson.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I how you learned something about how to interact with other websites.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.495
Good luck on the homeworks.
