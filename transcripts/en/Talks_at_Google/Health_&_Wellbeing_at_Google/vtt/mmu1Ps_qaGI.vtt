[SOUND EFFECT PLAYING]

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.490
SPEAKER 1: And today
I'm going to be

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.990
interviewing Oliver
Chittenden, who

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.460
is the founder of Head Talks.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.640
Oliver is, actually,
also the director

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.390
of the London Speaker's Bureau,
and he has been for 15 years.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.340
And he lines up speakers with
big government and corporate

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.870
events.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.340
So speakers along the lines of--

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.210
you've had politicians, prime
ministers, presidents, actors,

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.590
actresses, CEOs.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.980
Like that, sort of, top
level keynote speakers.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.760
So you've been doing that
successfully 15 years.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.160
Today Oliver's chance to
speak, and to tell his story.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.340
And the angle, I think,
that's really interesting,

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.000
and I think you guys will
understand and relate to,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.560
is the idea, is that we all
show a version of ourselves

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.070
to the world, particularly
in our careers.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.680
And there's usually another
story going on underneath.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.000
So in Oliver's case, from
the outside looking in,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.470
he had it all.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.500
He grew up in a castle
in Ireland, right?

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.500
OLIVER CHITTENDEN: Yeah.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.166
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:14.620
Grew up in a castle.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.020
Was educated at Harrow.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.810
Had this fantastic, and
still, very successful career.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.350
He has a beautiful
home in London.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.050
He has a beautiful
farmhouse in France.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.220
He has a gorgeous wife.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.870
He's very wonderful
and supportive.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.520
He's got a beautiful
little girl.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.755
They have a baby on the
way, due like a month today.

00:01:35.755 --> 00:01:36.754
OLIVER CHITTENDEN: Yeah.

00:01:36.754 --> 00:01:39.920
SPEAKER 1: So it's very easy
to hear that story and think,

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.350
Oliver's got it going on.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.010
He's really successful.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.100
He's sorted.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.550
but what's really interesting
is the other story, which Oliver

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.990
is here to talk about today.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.420
And it's your story,
and your ability

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.964
to begin telling your
story really honestly,

00:01:57.964 --> 00:01:59.380
and honorably to
people, which was

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.330
the beginning of
your own healing

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.940
of your own mental
health journey.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.490
And it was the beginning
of Head Talks, which

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.910
is his not for profit
online, sort of,

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.360
digital platform, where
it's kind of opening up

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.490
the conversation
around mental health,

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.070
and kind of removing
the stigma that's

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.970
attached to mental health.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.110
So shall we get started?

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.110
OLIVER CHITTENDEN: Yeah.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.609
Definitely.

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:24.180
I'm ready.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.130
That was a amazing introduction.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.690
I'll tell you the real me now.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:29.773
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, go ahead.

00:02:29.773 --> 00:02:33.910
Well, when did your journey
with mental health begin?

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.680
Where did it begin for you?

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.470
OLIVER CHITTENDEN:
I mean, I was lucky.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.350
I had a pretty
charmed upbringing,

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.840
largely due to my mother
remarrying very well.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.440
Actually, my father
was an alcoholic.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.150
So I lost him quite early on.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.460
But nevertheless, I was
brought up in a castle.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.275
And it was very
privileged upbringing.

00:02:54.275 --> 00:02:55.150
I had a twin brother.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.380
And we were sent off to
the posh private schools.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:06.159
And really, I was good
at sports, very sociable.

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:08.200
You know, everything on
paper seemed really well.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.140
And I remember having
actually no sense of fear

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.690
leaving school, and for
university, and things like.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:14.710
That I partied.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:15.910
And I was naughty.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:16.690
And I took drugs.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.220
And I did all those
kind of things.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.600
And a lot of us do.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.730
But the key thing was I really
felt the world was my oyster.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.760
And I felt, this is what
I've been brought up to do.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.250
I'm going to go out there
and achieve big things.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.490
And that's how I set
out on my journey.

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.870
And it was really, sort of, fast
forwarding to the age of 27.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.370
I'm now 41.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.890
Where, typically with my,
sort of, fighting spirit,

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.070
I found myself opening a
new office in Brussels.

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.860
I'd established the London
Speaker Bureau in London.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.560
And it was starting to go well.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.560
And I have languages.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.695
So I thought, again
typical of me,

00:03:58.695 --> 00:04:00.070
thinking, right,
let's push this.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.900
Let's keep pushing.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.650
Found myself in Brussels opening
up the London Speaker Bureau

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.660
office in Brussels.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.990
And I mean, the lead
up to that, there

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.077
was no real signs
of mental health.

00:04:13.077 --> 00:04:15.160
I mean, I didn't even know
what mental health was,

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.880
if I'm honest.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.130
I was brought up in
an environment where

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.480
you were seen and not heard.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.730
You didn't talk
about your emotions.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.890
So I had no language,
or no skills.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.200
It just wasn't part
of my vocabulary.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:32.940
And I remember having a
sort of pinpoint backache.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.930
It was literally one
where I could sort of

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.320
put my finger on the pain.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.210
And I was convinced it must be
something structural because I

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.452
could so pinpoint this pain.

00:04:42.452 --> 00:04:43.910
I went to all sorts
of specialists,

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.510
and of course, it was nothing.

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.000
At the time I thought
nothing of it.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.190
And then, whilst in Brussels,
and building this business,

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.620
I suddenly started getting
hit by these waves of anxiety.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.030
And they literally are waves.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.120
If you imagine the biggest
waves that exist in the world,

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.390
those pictures you see of
surfers going on these waves,

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.930
it's like being hit
like that all the time.

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.610
The best way I can
describe it is it's

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.010
a bit like being on an airplane.

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.430
And you know when it
suddenly dips down like that,

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.380
and your stomach jumps
up into your mouth?

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.090
It's like that feeling,
but all the time.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.620
And so it just wears you down,
wears you down, wears you down.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.510
And then the
depression kicks in,

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.950
because you've been so worn
down by this constant ravage

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.370
of anxiety that just takes
away your confidence,

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.640
your sense of self esteem,
your power, really,

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.800
your internal power
to try to operate.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.600
And I think, for me, having
been brought up the way I was,

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:51.430
and the way I, sort of, imagined
myself, or perceived myself,

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.550
I just couldn't
admit this to anyone.

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:55.930
I was like, all right--

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.670
I started self-medicating.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:01.030
I started taking drugs,
alcohol, anything to,

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.080
sort of, bury the pain.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.496
And I just pushed it down.

00:06:03.496 --> 00:06:04.120
Pushed it down.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.350
Pushed it down.

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.800
And you know, often I
would go back to London

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.300
to see my friends,
and it'd be like,

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.980
Oliver's the conquering hero.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.060
26 years old.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.200
Director of a company.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.060
Doing well.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:20.140
And I didn't let on that there
was this huge internal pain

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.920
going on inside me.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.360
And I carried on like
that for quite a while,

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.540
until I finally,
sort of, took myself

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:30.190
secretly to a psychiatrist.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.780
And I say secretly,
because I still

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.330
think there's a sense that
we failed if we go and see

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:35.950
a therapist today.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:37.074
There's still that stigma.

00:06:37.074 --> 00:06:39.490
It's like, oh, I must have
done something wrong in my life

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.700
if I go and see a brain doctor,
let's say, or a psychiatrist,

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.069
or a therapist.

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:45.610
And I remember going
to see this guy.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:46.693
And I'll never forget him.

00:06:46.693 --> 00:06:49.000
He made me tick all the boxes.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.090
Back then it was a
tick box scenario where

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:52.594
you filled the question in.

00:06:52.594 --> 00:06:54.385
And nowadays I think
about those questions.

00:06:54.385 --> 00:06:57.160
And I think most of us would
probably tick all those boxes

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.160
even if we were sane.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.520
And he said to me, look, you
need to go to the priory.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.607
You need round the
clock surveillance.

00:07:05.607 --> 00:07:06.940
You need a whole army of people.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.230
We'll get you better.

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:09.220
We'll get medication.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.210
All of this.

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.790
And then he said
something really powerful,

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:15.460
which at the time I didn't
take on board, which was,

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.670
your problem Oliver, is
that you're fighting.

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:21.510
And I looked at him and I
thought, what do you mean?

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:24.550
How can you-- are you telling
me to give up my fight?

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:27.160
I just couldn't
comprehend that logic,

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.680
because I'd always been taught
to fight for the things I

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.790
wanted in life.

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:33.917
And it was just
not in my DNA to--

00:07:33.917 --> 00:07:36.250
I thought, if I give up my
fight I might as well give up

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:38.960
my life, take my life even.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.810
And I ran out of that office.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:42.190
I booked a ticket to Australia.

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:42.850
Told no one.

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:43.770
And I went on the run.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:46.710
Literally I call
my year on the run.

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:49.220
And I won't take you into the
whole gory story of the year,

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.480
but essentially, it ended
up with me being picked up

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:57.020
off the pavement in Sydney,
and shipped back to England

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.240
to a treatment center.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:03.790
Luckily, for me, I have a
very supportive twin brother.

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:07.400
But also, I still had
insurance from my work,

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.800
which was still in place.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:09.760
I was incredibly lucky.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.400
So I went into a
treatment center.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.070
And I got the treatment
that I needed.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:18.610
And I was a very good patient.

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:20.210
I really wanted to get better.

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:22.420
And I think there
is this sense of,

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.640
you often have to be
brought to your knees

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.500
before you actually
ask for help.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.070
But it's actually at that
point of putting your hands up

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:31.830
is when the healing can begin.

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:35.940
And I think today we need
to really think about that.

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:39.159
And focus on this
idea of prevention,

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:41.200
especially with
the young, to stop

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.350
getting into this spiral,
which I went through,

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:48.190
because the longer you leave
it, the harder it is to unravel.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:52.060
And a lot of people
don't make it through.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.850
So that's kind of my journey.

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:58.510
And that was my first
experience with depression,

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:01.810
which came fairly late in
life, actually, age 27.

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:04.860
Often there's a history
up to that point,

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.470
from bullying in school,
or other problems at home,

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:11.151
or abuse, or
relationship issues.

00:09:11.151 --> 00:09:11.650
But no.

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:16.090
For me, it was a thunderbolt
out of the blue, age 27.

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:18.301
SPEAKER 1: Which you
originally completely ignored.

00:09:18.301 --> 00:09:19.300
OLIVER CHITTENDEN: Yeah.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:20.650
SPEAKER 1: Then hit rock bottom.

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:21.650
OLIVER CHITTENDEN: Yeah.

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:22.870
SPEAKER 1: To then go get help.

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:23.995
OLIVER CHITTENDEN: Correct.

00:09:23.995 --> 00:09:27.070
SPEAKER 1: So you had
the help at this clinic.

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:28.360
OLIVER CHITTENDEN: Yeah.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.380
SPEAKER 1: And at some point
you decided, well I'm OK now.

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:32.700
I don't need help anymore.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:33.700
OLIVER CHITTENDEN: Yeah.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:37.330
I mean, I did the CBT.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:38.830
The medication was thrown at me.

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:41.220
That was very much
the standard approach.

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:46.010
And I've now completely changed
my views on treatment services.

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:47.710
I'm not going to go
on about the NHS,

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:48.876
or anything like that today.

00:09:48.876 --> 00:09:51.440
But I do feel that
it's very archaic.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.560
It's very in need of innovation.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.170
And there are so many
things that we can do

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:57.550
to feel good about ourselves.

00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:59.740
And I think the important
thing to remember

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.440
is that we're all
so unique, in terms

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:05.870
of where we get our inspiration
or our sense of recovery from.

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:08.370
It's not a one size
fits all approach.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:12.170
It's very much a pick and
mix, create your own toolbox.

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:17.360
Find out what works for you
and do those every week.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.826
Like you would go to
the gym to stay fit,

00:10:19.826 --> 00:10:21.200
we need to try
and keep this fit.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.270
And there are a lot of practical
things that you can do.

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:28.860
And as the narrative is changing
from one of, kind of, stigma--

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.290
which is still there--

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:31.880
I'm hoping we can
now start really

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.932
focusing on some of
the practical things,

00:10:33.932 --> 00:10:35.390
and the media, that
we can actually

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:39.725
do to stay well, outside just
medication and CBT therapy.

00:10:39.725 --> 00:10:42.100
SPEAKER 1: And you're going
to share some of that with us

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:42.770
in a little bit.

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:44.020
OLIVER CHITTENDEN: Absolutely.

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:48.060
SPEAKER 1: Before we get to
that, so you had the therapy.

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:49.370
You're feeling good.

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:51.770
You took yourself, I
think, off to France.

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:54.440
You wrote two books.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:58.500
Met your wife, began
having first child.

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.530
Everything was
looking really good.

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:03.880
And you felt recovered.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.849
But then what happened?

00:11:05.849 --> 00:11:07.390
OLIVER CHITTENDEN:
So after my first,

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:09.760
kind of, depression, it was
a long journey out of it.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:13.600
I mean, it's not a light
switch, mental well-being.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.360
And because I'd left it,
and I buried it for so long,

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.330
it took that amount
of time to unravel it.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:22.450
So it's very much a journey
like that out of it.

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:25.450
It's, kind of, building
your mental resilience.

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:28.060
I set myself a good
two years to rebuild.

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:29.720
And there are knocks
on that journey.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.470
But eventually you do
build your resilience up

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:36.040
and you get back to,
sort of, a better place.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.020
But when that happened
I started to take

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:42.100
a bit of a philosophical view
on what had happened to me.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.530
In a way, I think it
made me a more humbler

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:49.060
person, a nicer person,
a more connected person.

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:51.640
I think the relationships
that I have with people

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:56.650
are much more personable,
and much more real,

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:57.700
as a result of it.

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:01.830
So I sort of looked at
it as part of my journey.

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:02.920
It's happened.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.530
But I also knew,
intrinsically from the pain

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:07.150
that I'd suffered--

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:09.940
and they say mental pain is
worse than physical pain.

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:12.760
And I absolutely
agree with that.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.460
I knew intrinsically
that I needed

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.410
to change something in my life.

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:21.610
And being me, I
went off to France,

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:24.720
and moved myself to France,
to the middle of nowhere.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.730
At the time they were giving
out mortgages to anyone.

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:31.490
And I was not, despite my
wonderful introduction,

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:35.470
I was not rich, or famous,
or anything like that.

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:37.210
I was pretty ordinary.

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:40.780
But ordinary enough to get
a 90% mortgage from a bank

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:44.750
on a foreign property pre-2008,
which is pretty unbelievable.

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:48.600
And I turned up in this village
in the middle of nowhere,

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.020
and settled in.

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.060
And my friends were
80, 90-year-olds.

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:55.560
And they were like, what is this
young Englishman doing here?

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.000
It's a very strange occurrence.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.770
But it was a very
happy time for me.

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:01.500
Cause I kind of grounded myself.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:06.670
I re-identified who I was,
and created a new identity

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:07.570
for myself, you know?

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:09.290
And I had a dog.

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:10.510
And I traveled a lot.

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:12.780
I was still working
with my speaker bureau,

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:15.340
but just remotely.

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:16.960
And there were
really good years.

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:17.890
Really great years.

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:20.020
I got married.

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.640
I had a little girl.

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.820
And we were living
the French life.

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.520
And in many ways I'd
forgotten about my depression.

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:31.750
And I definitely wasn't every
day using the tools that

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:36.640
I'd, perhaps, learnt in my
first instance with depression.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.670
And about 10 years later--

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:40.990
I also wrote some books.

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:44.147
And I've only had two big
episodes of depression.

00:13:44.147 --> 00:13:46.730
But something positive seems to
have come out of both of them.

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:49.250
And definitely getting
married, and moving to France,

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:50.500
and writing a couple of books.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.840
I did one book on
inspiration, and tried

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.000
to understand what
it is that inspires

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.185
people, rather than just talk
about their amazing stories.

00:13:59.185 --> 00:14:00.560
Actually try and
understand where

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.320
their inspiration came from.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.820
And that was a real
passion project,

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:08.060
as is Head Talks, which
I'll talk about in a minute.

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:09.640
And yeah, I remember
just one day.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.040
I remember it
very, very clearly.

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.790
A beautiful sunny day in France.

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:15.417
And I was saying
goodbye to my wife.

00:14:15.417 --> 00:14:17.000
And she had a friend
staying with her.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.130
And I went to England.

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:20.800
And it was to a funeral,
so not the nicest

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.140
of situations to go to.

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:24.480
But bang, I was triggered.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.320
I was back in the panic attacks.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.430
I was back into that anxiety.

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:30.440
And I was like, whoa,
where did this come from?

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.320
It was just like a sledgehammer.

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.300
And I just couldn't believe.

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:37.900
And I hoped that it would
just pause, at the start.

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:40.430
And I tried to start
remembering my tools, and some

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:41.680
of the therapy.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:42.760
And it didn't.

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.110
And it got worse and worse.

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:47.080
And I struggled and struggled.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:47.580
And--

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.440
SPEAKER 1: That must have
felt really devastating,

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.840
when it felt healed,
and then be--

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.010
OLIVER CHITTENDEN: It was.

00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:55.390
It was really horrible.

00:14:55.390 --> 00:15:00.010
And I've learned now
that a lot of people

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:02.620
misinterpret mental illness,
in the sense that you just

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:05.230
drop into a hole, and
pop out the other side.

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:08.500
It's often a lifetime
of careful management

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.030
to keep the so-called
black dog at the back door.

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:13.590
Not let him in.

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:16.030
And it's a big
misconception that people

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:17.230
have about mental illness.

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:19.780
But lo and behold I
really realized that when

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:22.610
it hits again, often it is
harder than the first time,

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:26.800
even though you can't imagine
it could be any worse.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.550
And I was so upset.

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:29.830
I was so angry.

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:32.440
I wasn't on my own in my life.

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:33.940
I had responsibilities.

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:35.980
I had a child who
was in a school.

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:38.770
I had a wife who didn't speak
French who I needed support.

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:40.240
We were in the
middle of nowhere.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:44.730
It wasn't like I could just
up and go somewhere else.

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:49.270
And so those pressures were
a lot harder to live with,

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:50.860
whilst being not well.

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:56.410
And I was never someone who was
totally crippled by depression.

00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:58.120
When I was under
my duvet every day

00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.670
I was always able to operate.

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:02.480
That was, kind of, my fighting
spirit, if you like, as well.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:03.610
And I did therapy.

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:04.654
I did Skype therapy.

00:16:04.654 --> 00:16:06.320
I thought, have I
missed something here?

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:10.390
Is there some trauma from my
past that I haven't dealt with?

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:12.790
And I did the therapy.

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:13.750
And I did all of this.

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:16.510
And it went on for a
good year and a half.

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:18.630
And we decided to
move back to London.

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:21.591
And it was at that point where
I, sort of, took quite a rash

00:16:21.591 --> 00:16:22.090
call.

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:24.714
And I thought, I really want to
throw the kitchen sink at this,

00:16:24.714 --> 00:16:31.030
and just break this pain
that was living with me.

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:34.060
And I took myself
off to the states.

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:36.370
I no longer had
health insurance.

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:39.730
And with health insurance,
another big problem

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:42.010
is if you're lucky enough
to afford private health

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:46.360
insurance, the minute you claim
some sort of mental health

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:49.480
issue you're
blacklisted completely.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.880
So there's a whole,
sort of, fight

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:54.880
that needs to happen there.

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:58.131
But I decided that I would
take myself off to the states.

00:16:58.131 --> 00:17:00.130
SPEAKER 1: When you took
yourself to the states,

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:02.040
did this feel like,
this is my last ditch--

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.040
OLIVER CHITTENDEN: Yeah.

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:03.750
SPEAKER 1: Effort?

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:05.020
I feel like I've
tried everything.

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:05.895
I've done everything.

00:17:05.895 --> 00:17:06.819
It's not working.

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:08.890
This has to work.

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:10.552
Did it feel like all or nothing?

00:17:10.552 --> 00:17:10.960
OLIVER CHITTENDEN: Yeah.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:11.569
Definitely.

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:13.900
I mean, again, it's
typical of my character

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.530
to do an all or
nothing approach.

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:17.894
And I just wanted to throw
the kitchen sink at it,

00:17:17.894 --> 00:17:21.670
and just see if I
could do something

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:25.050
to try and break this pattern.

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:27.910
And it was probably
quite foolish

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:29.610
and not thought out properly.

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:31.690
But I clinged on to this.

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:33.370
Through my speaking
activities I know

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:35.650
about this lady called
Brene Brown, who

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:38.660
is one of the most
viewed TED Speakers.

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:41.890
She's basically the, sort
of, guru on vulnerability.

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:44.410
And I really recommend her
books, actually, and at least

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:46.900
watching her TED talk.

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:49.600
And I saw that she was
running a workshop.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.000
She runs workshops in Tennessee.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.984
She's based at
Dallas University.

00:17:53.984 --> 00:17:55.900
I thought, right, well
I'm going to go for it.

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:56.983
I'm going to go out there.

00:17:56.983 --> 00:18:00.030
And I'm going to go on
this vulnerability journey,

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:01.310
and expose my pain.

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:03.870
She talks about
leaning into the pain.

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:06.220
And I thought, well, I'm
as vulnerable as I can be.

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:07.510
So I'll just go for it.

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:09.880
And I went out there.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:15.710
And it was hard for
my wife to see me go.

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:17.270
But I wanted to do. it.

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:18.490
I wanted to get away.

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:22.730
Save them the pain of seeing
me how I was, and try it out.

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:24.010
So it was 30 days.

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:28.300
And it was intense, as
Americans are quite intense.

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:29.950
Very process driven.

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:30.640
No phones.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:31.720
No TV.

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:35.560
It was quite holistic,
which I quite liked as well.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.980
But what happened during
that period of time

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:43.430
was I got very ill
physically, as well.

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:45.630
So I was ill mentally.

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:49.270
And my organs started
shutting down on me.

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:51.530
And it started with my kidney.

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:55.480
And then my bladder,
my liver, my prostate.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:57.820
And I ended up in hospital
in Nashville really,

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:01.360
really properly ill.

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:06.320
And it was just very, very hard.

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.360
I was my own.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.820
But I remember thinking to
myself on that hospital bed,

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:12.520
I remember thinking,
maybe, just maybe this

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.890
is what it's going to
take to break this.

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:16.060
I was like, bring it on.

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:17.399
Let's see.

00:19:17.399 --> 00:19:19.690
SPEAKER 1: You body's, like,
your last line of defense,

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:20.395
isn't it?

00:19:20.395 --> 00:19:22.210
And it's almost
like if you're not

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:24.982
listening to where
your healing is--

00:19:24.982 --> 00:19:27.190
and I know we're going to
get on to this in a second.

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:29.020
But if you're not
really listening

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:31.104
to what you need to heal
your body is going to go,

00:19:31.104 --> 00:19:31.978
right, you know what?

00:19:31.978 --> 00:19:33.010
I'm going to shut down.

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:34.120
And then maybe
you'll listen to me.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:34.810
Maybe then you'll
take this seriously.

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:37.120
OLIVER CHITTENDEN: I was
so caught up in my head

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.700
that I wasn't
listening to my body.

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:43.000
And I think, looking back on
it, it was my body's reaction

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.140
to that, kind of, holding
on, for those years.

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:48.270
It was like, now,
just let it go.

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:50.920
And I cried, and I cried.

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.660
I learnt how to cry.

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.310
I've never cried, really.

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:55.270
In my life.

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:58.630
And now it's a major
part of my own toolbox.

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:02.410
It's actually a really
important part of my toolbox.

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:07.300
I get a huge, sort of,
release of anxiety, and pain.

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:08.914
And I find it very helpful.

00:20:08.914 --> 00:20:11.080
I think having been very
sort of, blokish, I call it

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.230
my man cry.

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:15.010
In fact, the louder it gets,
the better the healing.

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:16.960
SPEAKER 1: Totally.

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.680
OLIVER CHITTENDEN:
So yeah I did that.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:23.050
But again, I think at that
time, and that experience,

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:25.500
and coming back to my
family, I was so broken.

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.610
I was just so broken literally.

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:28.600
I could hardly talk.

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.300
And I was so, so broken.

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:34.330
But I knew, again, at this
time that something good was

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:35.610
going to happen out that.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:39.260
That something out of the
darkness was going to happen.

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:41.620
And that's really,
kind of, what happens.

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:44.950
Slowly but surely I started
building my mental resilience.

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:48.745
And that's what gave
birth to Head Talks.

00:20:48.745 --> 00:20:51.340
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, but
what you did was you

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:55.030
went from that
fighting attitude,

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:59.500
all your life fighting,
and striving, and pushing.

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.630
And then with managing
your mental health

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:03.380
it was fighting,
striving, pushing

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:06.720
to search for the answer, to get
the solution, to do the work.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.470
And then, I think it's
really interesting, actually,

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:11.570
that you kind of brought
to Brene Brown's work

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:13.670
on vulnerability,
because within that

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:16.850
was a little seed of,
well, maybe that's

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:18.860
where my healing lies.

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:22.790
Maybe it's in being vulnerable
and no longer fighting.

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:24.800
And then when your
body totally shut down

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:29.480
and you were that sick, you
were utterly vulnerable.

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.640
And there was an element
of surrender at that

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:32.930
moment for you, wasn't there?

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:37.060
So you went from really
fighting to, OK, I really

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:39.330
have to surrender now.

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:43.490
And I think, within the
surrender was your freedom.

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:44.740
OLIVER CHITTENDEN: Definitely.

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:45.890
SPEAKER 1: And your healing.

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:47.140
OLIVER CHITTENDEN: Absolutely.

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:50.330
I think acceptance, for
me, was such a key word.

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:51.650
I was no longer fighting.

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:54.214
I accepted that
this was something

00:21:54.214 --> 00:21:55.380
that I would have to manage.

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:57.060
It could become
again in my life,

00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:59.550
in 10 years, three
years, two years.

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:04.280
But it was something I had to
accept, rather than push away.

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:07.490
And it remains a really
key point in my recovery,

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:08.845
and in my toolbox.

00:22:08.845 --> 00:22:11.060
So that when I do
get anxious or I do

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:13.730
feel depressed, rather
than just pushing it away,

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:15.690
I just kind of accept it.

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:16.770
I don't resist.

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:18.740
And I think that's
really, really important.

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:20.130
Just to always use the--

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:21.350
I have various analogies.

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:23.090
But it's like the bus analogy.

00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:25.190
It's like, as long as
I'm driving the bus,

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:26.870
all the emotions
can be passengers.

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:29.130
And they might try and get
to the front and drive it.

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:30.770
But I'm in charge.

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:33.800
And they can come,
and flow in, flow out.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:37.427
But yeah, acceptance
was very key for me.

00:22:37.427 --> 00:22:39.301
SPEAKER 1: And I've
heard you talk about-- it

00:22:39.301 --> 00:22:40.570
was your crucible moment.

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:41.570
OLIVER CHITTENDEN: Yeah.

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:42.080
It was.

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.454
I mean, in many
ways it was like,

00:22:43.454 --> 00:22:45.180
something's got to change.

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:48.470
I think, you know, we all
get a big, big kind of,

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:50.720
wake up call when we get ill.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.810
Whether it's an illness, or
an accident, or something

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:54.560
like that.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.690
Something profoundly
changes in us.

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:58.710
I've seen it in a lot of people.

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:01.670
And for me, I didn't quite
know what it would be.

00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:03.710
But I knew something
would change.

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:10.160
SPEAKER 1: So I thank god for
the journey that you've had,

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:13.250
because at every stage
of it you learned

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:17.480
different ways of coping
with your own mental health.

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.605
And through that, you
created your own toolbox.

00:23:19.605 --> 00:23:22.290
And we're going to get
to that in a minute.

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:24.650
But through it you
realized-- and this

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:26.390
is what so powerful
about your story,

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:28.140
and what you're doing
now with Head Talks.

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:32.360
You realized that mental
health isn't a one stop shop.

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:35.840
It's like, there's not
one fix for everybody.

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.852
You have to create
your own toolkit.

00:23:37.852 --> 00:23:39.060
OLIVER CHITTENDEN: That's it.

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:40.085
Definitely.

00:23:40.085 --> 00:23:42.860
And I learn, and
I'm still learning.

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:43.580
I still learn.

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:46.121
And one of the beauties of the
journey I'm on with Head Talks

00:23:46.121 --> 00:23:49.820
is I'm interviewing so many
different types of people.

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:53.045
And I was interviewing a guy
who's a specialist on, kind of,

00:23:53.045 --> 00:23:57.040
the impact of cold water on your
mental health, arctic water.

00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:00.140
Swimming clubs are swelling
up around the country.

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:02.540
And it comes from
Scandinavia and Switzerland.

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:06.380
And it's great to
try these things out.

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:10.220
And I'm trying to create
this platform so that people

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.740
can have access to some of the
practical things we can do,

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:16.340
because yes, I passionately
believe that this idea that you

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:19.880
can just address mental health
with meditation and CBT, which

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:22.310
is what we're
getting from the NHS.

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:26.150
It's just not the
right approach.

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:29.390
We need to be offering a
lot more variety, in terms

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:31.700
of what you can
do, because you can

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.130
get as much inspirational
sense of recovery

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:36.200
from singing in your
local choir than you can

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.030
from taking a pill.

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:42.080
It might be swimming in the cold
ocean, acupuncture, something

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:45.620
more holistic, like
yoga or meditation.

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:47.510
There are lots and lots
of things you can do,

00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:51.870
and it's about holding onto the
things that make you feel good,

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:55.370
and adding them to your
toolbox, because quite frankly,

00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:57.590
we all need a toolbox in 2017.

00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:59.270
It's chaos out there.

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:01.010
The digital world,
you guys know about.

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:02.600
It's overwhelming.

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:05.490
We need to think about this.

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:07.370
It almost feels like
we've gone into battle.

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:09.980
We've, kind of,
innovated and we've

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:12.181
gone so far down that journey.

00:25:12.181 --> 00:25:13.430
And we've dealt with the body.

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:14.510
But we've kind of--

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:16.070
haven't had a plan
B for the mind.

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:18.440
We've kind of forgotten
about the mind.

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:23.120
And the mind is what makes you
the best version of yourself.

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:27.470
It's the thing that gives you
the best experiences, the best

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:29.150
relationships, friendships.

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:30.950
If you're in a good
state mentally,

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:33.500
all those things are
going to be better.

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:35.030
So yeah, I've got lots of views.

00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:36.760
And I can go on and on.

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:37.974
But I'd love to show the

00:25:37.974 --> 00:25:39.890
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, why
don't we take a look at--

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:40.300
OLIVER CHITTENDEN:
The show reel--

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:40.440
SPEAKER 1: The show reel.

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:41.720
OLIVER CHITTENDEN: Just to
give you a sense of Head

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.760
Talks, and the
journey I've been on.

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:53.120
SPEAKER 3: My 13th birthday I
thought that I would actually

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:56.690
go out and give myself a
birthday present that I wanted.

00:25:56.690 --> 00:26:01.370
And that was the
first time I had sex,

00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:04.520
at 13 with a 26-year-old man.

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:10.599
And I didn't realize
that was abuse.

00:26:10.599 --> 00:26:12.140
SPEAKER 4: I didn't
have any alcohol.

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:13.140
I didn't have any drugs.

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:14.710
I didn't have any
means of numbing

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:16.725
that anxiety, and that
pain, and that adrenalin

00:26:16.725 --> 00:26:18.150
that I was feeling at the time.

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:22.582
And I took a knife and
I cut my chest open.

00:26:22.582 --> 00:26:24.810
SPEAKER 5: It was like
everybody in your life

00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:27.870
that you loved had
suddenly all been killed.

00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:29.140
And that was it.

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:31.900
And it was like the
world had almost ended.

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:33.980
SPEAKER 6: It's a car crash.

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:36.020
It's going through
the windscreen

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:38.790
and lying in the middle
of the motorway, not sure

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:40.775
if you can move your limbs.

00:26:40.775 --> 00:26:42.150
SPEAKER 7: I
actually totally had

00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:45.090
come to terms that
it was fine to die.

00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:47.300
I just thought, you
know, I've done my best.

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:49.910
Sorry I'm feeling a
bit emotional now.

00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:51.692
You know, I've had my children.

00:26:51.692 --> 00:26:52.650
They've got each other.

00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:54.358
You Know, my husband
can look after them.

00:26:54.358 --> 00:26:55.640
Actually, I can't go on.

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.120
This pain is just too awful.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.203
SPEAKER 8: And I really
think, looking back on it,

00:26:59.203 --> 00:27:02.670
that's really that point
when the recovery started,

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:05.220
because I wasn't
fighting against myself.

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:08.330
SPEAKER 3: I asked
myself a question.

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:11.020
But whose words are they?

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:12.750
And it's like, ah.

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:15.400
Cause they aren't my words.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:20.540
They are words that were
given to me as a child.

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:25.250
And I realized, if
they're not my words,

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:27.710
then I can stop saying them.

00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:38.150
And I stopped saying
them to myself.

00:27:44.055 --> 00:27:45.430
SPEAKER 5: It was
through talking

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:48.700
about what I was feeling
that actually helped

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:53.950
me make sense of it, and
turn it into a strength,

00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:55.090
as opposed to a weakness.

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:57.940
SPEAKER 9: You've really got
to look behind what's there,

00:27:57.940 --> 00:27:59.590
and then create something new.

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:02.110
Hence the need for
acupuncturists,

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:05.470
for yoga, for people
doing EMDR, for rolfing.

00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:07.660
For all the things that
people are looking for,

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:10.900
to kind of, cathartically
to get it out.

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:12.670
SPEAKER 10: So
it's the intention

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:18.320
that you put into talking, into
the needle when you apply it

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:19.560
to the body.

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:22.225
SPEAKER 6: If you've got cancer,
and you've had chemotherapy,

00:28:22.225 --> 00:28:24.130
and your hair's all
fallen out, and you've

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:27.610
got that, kind of, look that
people have, people look at you

00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:28.270
and they know.

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:30.454
And we've developed the
language to deal with that.

00:28:30.454 --> 00:28:31.870
But when you walk
down the street,

00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:36.550
and you see somebody in
emotional distress, which

00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:41.982
I think we see more and more
of, we haven't got the language.

00:28:41.982 --> 00:28:44.190
SPEAKER 11: When you start
to talk about these issues

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:46.506
to groups of people
there will be those who

00:28:46.506 --> 00:28:48.880
put their hand up and say,
actually, yeah I've felt that,

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:51.160
or I went through that.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.620
And that, actually,
is what Olly's

00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:55.890
trying to do with Mind Talks, is
to get people talking about it,

00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:59.400
in order to build a community,
to get the issue out there,

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.772
and to get people realizing
that there is help,

00:29:01.772 --> 00:29:03.480
and there are positive
things you can do.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:06.250
SPEAKER 12: Well I think this
is a fantastic initiative.

00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:09.410
It's all about getting mental
health out into the open.

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:10.680
Normalizing it in a way.

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:13.710
And removing the
mystery, the mistake,

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:15.234
and critically, the stigma.

00:29:15.234 --> 00:29:16.650
There's nothing
more that we could

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:18.390
do in society that
could have a bigger

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:21.710
impact on the well-being
of our country,

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:24.870
than if we focus
on mental health,

00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:27.004
and stop the neglect
of mentally ill health.

00:29:29.516 --> 00:29:31.182
SPEAKER 1: How does
it feel seeing that?

00:29:31.182 --> 00:29:31.946
OLIVER CHITTENDEN: Yes--

00:29:31.946 --> 00:29:33.240
SPEAKER 1: Do you feel proud?

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:34.780
OLIVER CHITTENDEN: I do.

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:36.185
It makes me feel
quite emotional.

00:29:36.185 --> 00:29:38.040
And I just think how
brave those people

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.440
are to share their story.

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:45.240
But it also, it just amazes
me how much pain is out there,

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:46.150
quite frankly.

00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:49.470
It's like if you can create
the environments for people

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:55.010
to share and to be honest with
what's going on in their lives,

00:29:55.010 --> 00:30:00.330
it's a real privilege to
be able to have an impact,

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:02.034
and to see that show.

00:30:02.034 --> 00:30:02.950
SPEAKER 1: Absolutely.

00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:04.120
It's amazing.

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:05.685
So it was a seed of an idea.

00:30:05.685 --> 00:30:06.685
OLIVER CHITTENDEN: Yeah.

00:30:06.685 --> 00:30:09.330
SPEAKER 1: And now it's an
up and running, functioning,

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:12.020
changing people's
lives platform.

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:15.670
So can you describe
exactly what it is?

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:17.070
OLIVER CHITTENDEN: Sure.

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:19.110
So I spent the last
year and a half

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:22.470
going up and down the
country interviewing people.

00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:25.020
I really, at the start
I was free styling it.

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:27.090
I self-funded.

00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:28.230
Had no real support.

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:30.870
Didn't understand how a
camera worked, or editing,

00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:33.750
or anything like that.

00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:35.240
And I just went on this journey.

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:41.430
And I wasn't entirely sure where
it was going, if I'm honest.

00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:44.560
But I knew that I wanted
to do this visually.

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:46.960
I think there's
so much out there

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:52.600
that is very academic looking,
scientific, very wordy, online.

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:56.580
And especially in alternative
therapies, it's so vast,

00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:58.830
and there's no real
leadership in it.

00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:02.400
So you can get very lost as
someone who's struggling,

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.800
and you can spend a lot of
money, and a lot of time.

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:07.914
And often it can be too
late to get to what's

00:31:07.914 --> 00:31:08.830
going to work for you.

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:11.700
So I wanted to try and
create a platform that

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:16.470
brought all of this together in
a, sort of, modern looking way,

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:22.800
in a visual way that people
could communicate easily

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.220
via social media.

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:25.470
I was very aware of the young.

00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:27.810
And I wanted them to
really understand this.

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:30.519
And to have a website
where you weren't looking

00:31:30.519 --> 00:31:32.310
over your shoulder
thinking, god, someone's

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:34.830
going to see me on a
mental health site.

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:37.700
I think the way the website
looks, it's very fresh.

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:41.715
It's just lots of different
people talking about the mind,

00:31:41.715 --> 00:31:43.770
really, from different angles.

00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:47.670
And it was astonishing how
people would just drop in

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:52.680
with-- and I would be with
academics, scientists, authors,

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:55.282
and people with success stories.

00:31:55.282 --> 00:31:57.490
And some, at the end of it
they'd say something like,

00:31:57.490 --> 00:32:00.540
yeah, and I spent a
year on the streets,

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:04.050
and my wife committed suicide
then, and that was challenging.

00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:05.960
And so everyone's
got their story.

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:09.400
and it was a beautiful journey.

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:13.470
And I think one of the things
that really bounced out at me

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:18.510
was there's a real feeling of
disconnection, in the world,

00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:21.030
actually.

00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:22.950
The irony being we've
invented the internet

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:23.850
to be more connected.

00:32:23.850 --> 00:32:27.912
But actually I don't think we've
ever felt more disconnected.

00:32:27.912 --> 00:32:33.030
Add on top of that, this
capitalist drive that

00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:36.480
has really had a negative
impact on community where

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:39.120
you can get so much healing.

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:41.520
They've done both on a lot
of good things, the internet,

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:42.750
and capitalism.

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:44.430
But there have been downsides.

00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:46.830
And I think mental
health has definitely

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:49.810
suffered as a result of them.

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:53.790
And it was really about giving
access to lots of people,

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:56.760
to lots of different
things that they could do.

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:59.850
Informing them, inspiring
them, and educating people

00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:02.070
so that they could
make their own choices,

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:04.630
create their own
Head Talks journey,

00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:06.005
and go back into
their community.

00:33:06.005 --> 00:33:07.860
And they're going,
ah, I really resonated

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:10.260
with what that guy said,
or what that lady said.

00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:11.530
I'm going to try that out.

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:14.520
Or, yeah, that was
really interesting,

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:18.570
using poetry, or gardening,
as my form of therapy.

00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:20.760
So I didn't really
know, at the start,

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:21.930
where it was going to go.

00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:25.860
But with my experience
with the speaker network

00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:29.210
I was able to, sort
of, network quite well.

00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:32.100
And it was a, sort of, balancing
act of who to interview,

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:36.596
because although the
big names are good,

00:33:36.596 --> 00:33:38.220
because they create
a bit of awareness,

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:39.636
I was very conscious
that I didn't

00:33:39.636 --> 00:33:43.410
want to create a, kind of,
bandwagon for celebrities.

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:45.120
I think there is a
danger that depression

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:46.950
is becoming quite cool.

00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:48.345
It's like, yeah I'm depressed.

00:33:48.345 --> 00:33:50.490
I'm cool.

00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:53.700
And I didn't want this
site to be like that.

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:59.520
But at the same time, it
helps draw attention to it.

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:02.640
But I also wanted people
with lived experience.

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:05.430
And actually, now that I'm able
to, sort of, track where people

00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:10.290
go, what videos are most
popular, the lived experience

00:34:10.290 --> 00:34:11.940
is still really
powerful for people,

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:16.090
because it creates hope, a sense
of community, a sense of I'm

00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:18.330
not my own having
these thoughts.

00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:21.570
I always say, it's like we all
have, kind of, battlefields

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:26.190
going on in our minds
in some shape or form,

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:30.709
and just being able to
give some air to that.

00:34:30.709 --> 00:34:36.019
And lived experience, also where
it's really helpful is that--

00:34:36.019 --> 00:34:37.810
I say to people when
I'm interviewing them.

00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:40.960
I just say, that tell me
about the darkness, the pain,

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:42.190
and then the journey out.

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:43.870
The tools that worked for you.

00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:45.040
And what you're up to now.

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:48.190
And it's the variety
of tools that people

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:51.850
have used, which are
so helpful, because you

00:34:51.850 --> 00:34:53.920
can learn from other people.

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:55.989
And if you connect
with them, then you

00:34:55.989 --> 00:34:57.610
can try their tools
out, just as you

00:34:57.610 --> 00:35:01.130
can try someone who's
a specialist on yoga,

00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:02.740
and really focus on yoga.

00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:06.170
So it's bringing all of
that together in one place

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:10.130
was what I was
trying to achieve.

00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:12.560
But it's very organic.

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:14.440
It's moving.

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.300
It needs to be like
that, to, sort of,

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:17.750
go with what people are after.

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:20.880
I mean, I never had
a Facebook page.

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:21.900
I'm coming to the dig--

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:22.880
SPEAKER 1: You still
don't have one?

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.670
OLIVER CHITTENDEN: No I'm
coming to the digital world

00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:25.450
very late on.

00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:27.190
But it's a good learning.

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:29.150
It's a great, great
thing for mental--

00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:31.233
SPEAKER 1: Olly did his
first Facebook Live today.

00:35:31.233 --> 00:35:32.950
OLIVER CHITTENDEN: Yeah.

00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:35.980
Learning and curiosity are
very, very powerful things

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:37.620
for keeping a healthy mind.

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:38.370
SPEAKER 1: Indeed.

00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:41.800
And I've heard it said,
many times actually,

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:45.580
that having your own business
is the best personal development

00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:48.010
journey you could ever
take, because you learn

00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:49.930
a hell of a lot about
yourself in setting up

00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:52.690
your own
entrepreneurial venture.

00:35:52.690 --> 00:35:56.050
What have you learned through
setting up Head Talks, which

00:35:56.050 --> 00:35:57.970
is such an inspired action?

00:35:57.970 --> 00:35:59.770
OLIVER CHITTENDEN:
I think I'm so

00:35:59.770 --> 00:36:02.220
happy to be doing something
I'm really passionate about,

00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:04.450
because it means so much to me.

00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:07.760
And I think being able
to contribute, as well.

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:09.790
I spent 18 years in
the corporate world.

00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:12.460
And you know, even
though The Speaker Bureau

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:15.400
has this, sort of, soft
sounding ring about it,

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:18.470
it's quite a aggressive
world to be in.

00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:19.750
Its deal making.

00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:21.760
And people are charging
a lot of money,

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:24.610
and are dealing with lots
of crooked politicians

00:36:24.610 --> 00:36:26.200
making lots of money.

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:28.127
And I love it.

00:36:28.127 --> 00:36:28.960
And it's been great.

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:30.280
And it's still part of my life.

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:34.930
But it's just so refreshing to
be part of my tribe, as well?

00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:39.220
I feel like my work is like
linked to my well-being

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:42.020
now, which is a real
relief, to be honest.

00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:42.520
And--

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:44.223
SPEAKER 1: Sort of be
able to merge the two.

00:36:44.223 --> 00:36:45.222
OLIVER CHITTENDEN: Yeah.

00:36:45.222 --> 00:36:46.630
And just creating
that community,

00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:49.049
and reaching out to people.

00:36:49.049 --> 00:36:49.840
And it's been hard.

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:52.930
I mean, you know, I still
have really hard days and.

00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:54.400
I don't react well to stress.

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:58.160
And getting something like
this launched is not easy.

00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:59.360
There's loads of challenges.

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.690
But just keep pushing.

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:03.130
I think when you've
got a passion,

00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:08.320
and you're on something, even
if all the walls are coming up,

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:11.080
it's like just a
little window opens up,

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:15.920
and you creep through it,
and you're away again.

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:17.764
It's been great.

00:37:17.764 --> 00:37:19.180
The one thing I'm
trying to do now

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:24.160
is just step back and digest
it, and really appreciate

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:28.646
what I'm doing, and kind
of, be present with it,

00:37:28.646 --> 00:37:30.770
because there's always so
much to do in a start up.

00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:32.785
Especially if you're on
your own, driving at--

00:37:32.785 --> 00:37:35.160
SPEAKER 1: Well, you're full
time with the London Speaker

00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:36.610
Bureau.

00:37:36.610 --> 00:37:37.944
And this is a full time gig now.

00:37:37.944 --> 00:37:39.984
OLIVER CHITTENDEN: Yeah,
it's more full time now.

00:37:39.984 --> 00:37:40.880
SPEAKER 1: As well.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:44.160
So I think that's probably
a nice little lead

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:46.690
into your toolbox,
and how you're

00:37:46.690 --> 00:37:49.330
managing your mental health
now, because probably

00:37:49.330 --> 00:37:52.490
now more than ever you need it,
and you need to walk your talk.

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:55.130
Live that truth to keep
inspiring other people,

00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:57.100
and have this be an
authentic venture.

00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:57.680
OLIVER CHITTENDEN:
Yeah definitely.

00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:59.680
SPEAKER 1: So should we
take a look at that--

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:00.846
OLIVER CHITTENDEN: I think--

00:38:00.846 --> 00:38:02.830
SPEAKER 1: Slide that
you've got on your end?

00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:04.288
OLIVER CHITTENDEN:
Part of the idea

00:38:04.288 --> 00:38:07.350
with Head Talks-- and we're
still in a phase one approach.

00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:10.300
And luckily we had funding
from a foundation that's

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:11.940
completely non-profit.

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:14.370
But we're now going to
start going into corporates,

00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:15.460
and doing workshops.

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:17.787
But I'm hoping that--

00:38:17.787 --> 00:38:19.370
I sort of have this
vision, that there

00:38:19.370 --> 00:38:21.520
will be a basket, a
bit like on Amazon,

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:24.040
and you'll be able to
drop your videos into it,

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:25.270
and create your own toolbox.

00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:28.030
And we'll be able to actually
give people a real journey

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:29.470
through Head Talks.

00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:32.930
But this is what works for me.

00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:36.250
I mean you know, as I said
earlier, we're all so unique.

00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:39.070
And I think, whether we do it
consciously or unconsciously,

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:42.580
we all do things to
keep us on the level.

00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:45.310
Even if we're not
talking mental health.

00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:47.910
So I have to go to the
gym on a Monday morning.

00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:49.660
That's just something
I really try and do.

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:51.730
I actually need to
go three times a day.

00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:56.620
I love kicking the
shit out of a punchbag,

00:38:56.620 --> 00:39:01.870
because that releases a lot
of my anxiety and stress.

00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:03.655
Good sleep is just crucial.

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:08.590
I stopped drinking last year.

00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:09.520
I love wine.

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:12.450
But it just started
affecting my sleep.

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:15.740
And so I just woke up too
many mornings thinking,

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:17.420
I can't feel like this anymore.

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:19.120
So I gave that up.

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:20.670
I'll have a beer
occasionally still.

00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:25.580
But you know, the
party days are waning.

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:31.430
I love sunshine, massage, spa.

00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:34.040
Those are all luxuries
that I do occasionally.

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:36.270
I meditate every
morning for 20 minutes.

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:38.120
That's something
I do religiously.

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:41.270
Meditation's probably the
biggest gift I've given myself.

00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:43.580
And it's not easy to get into.

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:45.050
There's loads of apps.

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:49.130
It's a very personal journey,
like all these things are.

00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:51.770
But it's really,
really helped me.

00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:55.910
I actually have someone I know,
so I went to various retreats.

00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:56.720
And I followed him.

00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:01.850
And I have a recording that
I listen to in the morning.

00:40:01.850 --> 00:40:05.360
And it's just vital for me.

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:07.110
Allowing myself a man cry.

00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:08.360
That's been huge for me.

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:12.830
It's almost like I drop
into like, the victim.

00:40:12.830 --> 00:40:14.270
And I say, you know what?

00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:15.440
I'm really pissed off.

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:20.810
I'm so fed up with having
to manage this mental health

00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:22.260
issue.

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:25.165
And I'll watch a
video of my daughter,

00:40:25.165 --> 00:40:28.450
or a really sad talk
on the internet,

00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:32.730
or a really sad movie, just to
get, kind of, emotions going.

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:34.070
And then bang I'll let it out.

00:40:34.070 --> 00:40:35.870
It sounds a bit
like a machine gun.

00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:37.610
And it's brilliant.

00:40:37.610 --> 00:40:38.960
And it resets.

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:40.670
Me it just completely resets me.

00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:42.980
And I realized that age 40.

00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:45.590
Talking, talking,
talking honestly.

00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:50.270
I always challenge myself to
be as honest as I possibly can.

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:52.070
And then, obviously,
the mindful thing

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:53.870
is linked to the meditation.

00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:56.790
But it is as simple as
recognizing the blossom

00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:57.290
out there.

00:40:57.290 --> 00:41:01.760
Just stopping, taking a
different route to work.

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:03.280
Just changing things a bit.

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.970
I often find having
a cup of tea,

00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:08.882
or an apple, or a raise,
just to smother the senses.

00:41:08.882 --> 00:41:10.340
You know often, if
you're, kind of,

00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:12.650
going round and round in
your head, if you can just

00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:13.910
smother one sense--

00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:18.770
like, for me, loud music in my
ears can drown out the voices.

00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:22.460
Or can buy like eucalyptus,
and you can inhale it.

00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:24.230
And just for the sense of smell.

00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:27.440
And it just, kind
of, clears the head.

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.330
And so there's just
little, sort of,

00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:32.910
mindfulness things that I do.

00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:33.410
And yeah.

00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:36.934
And just exercise is Key
I know everyone says it.

00:41:36.934 --> 00:41:37.850
And it's quite boring.

00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:40.890
But it really is
very, very important.

00:41:40.890 --> 00:41:43.730
So it's not rocket
science, all of it.

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:45.080
But it's what works for me.

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:46.640
But I'm still trying things.

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:49.520
I mean, I was talking
to this cold water guy.

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:53.330
He's been-- for 13 years, he
swims every day in Brighton

00:41:53.330 --> 00:41:53.840
in the sea.

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:55.700
And he was telling me
about the community

00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:57.860
that meets every day at 7 AM.

00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:00.980
It's people with
arthritis, with no legs.

00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:04.490
But you know, this cold water
is having a hue impact on them.

00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:09.121
And I've been, sort of, looking
up where these outdoor swimming

00:42:09.121 --> 00:42:09.620
pools are.

00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:10.890
So I'm still learning.

00:42:10.890 --> 00:42:12.819
And I still try
things out as well.

00:42:12.819 --> 00:42:15.110
SPEAKER 1: What do you think
the most watched video is?

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:20.940
OLIVER CHITTENDEN: The most
watched video, I think--

00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:23.850
what's been interesting
is the men, actually,

00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:28.620
because I think, men,
we've kind of bred this--

00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:30.180
historically, the
man's gone out,

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:33.960
and has brought in the food,
and delivered, and gone out

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:34.680
and done the job.

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:37.110
And even we talk
about manning up,

00:42:37.110 --> 00:42:42.060
and the man being the
strength in the family.

00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:44.460
And I think, you look
at male suicide rates,

00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:46.510
and it's really,
really worrying.

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:49.110
I think outside
car crashes, it's

00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:54.120
the biggest killer of young
men, because it's hard for a man

00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:57.610
to come forward and
talk about his emotions.

00:42:57.610 --> 00:43:01.530
And I think there's an amazing
story of Johnny Benjamin, who

00:43:01.530 --> 00:43:02.894
is the man on the bridge guy.

00:43:02.894 --> 00:43:04.560
I don't know if you
guys know about him.

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:08.610
But he was about to commit
suicide off London Bridge.

00:43:08.610 --> 00:43:11.490
And a passer by came and
talked him out of it.

00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:13.530
And then he spent--

00:43:13.530 --> 00:43:17.190
I can't remember how many years
trying to find the passer by.

00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:20.520
And they've linked up now
and they tell their story.

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:23.580
But also really successful
people, like Simon Woodruff,

00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:25.800
the founder of Yo sushi.

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.395
A millionaire in his own right.

00:43:27.395 --> 00:43:30.390
He lives on a houseboat
on the Thames.

00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:33.300
Hearing him talk about
how he prays with his wife

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:38.170
every morning by his bed, and
his problems with depression,

00:43:38.170 --> 00:43:39.630
and addiction.

00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:40.470
Very humbling.

00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:45.390
And then, even Nick Love,
who's from a council

00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:48.950
estate in the east end who's
quite a big film director.

00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:51.890
Who does very hard edge films
on football hooliganism,

00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:53.334
and things like that.

00:43:53.334 --> 00:43:55.500
And him talking about how
he goes to boxing and just

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:58.350
breaks down in tears
because of this release.

00:43:58.350 --> 00:44:02.599
It's very powerful,
those kind of stories.

00:44:02.599 --> 00:44:03.890
You have to go and have a look.

00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:05.700
I mean, there are lots.

00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:06.900
Again, it's unique.

00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:08.700
It's like, what does it for you?

00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:11.460
The lived experiences
and the ordinary folk,

00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:14.170
as well, are equally powerful?

00:44:14.170 --> 00:44:17.430
But I hope-- whenever I sit
down with someone I say,

00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:20.610
if you want to
swear, cry, laugh.

00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:24.084
Just make it real and
take us on that journey.

00:44:24.084 --> 00:44:24.750
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:25.380
Yeah.

00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:28.470
I find it really, really
touching and very powerful

00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:32.130
when you say so,
kind of, casually,

00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:35.910
how you'll have a good man
cry, or your need to box,

00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:37.600
or you just need
to express emotion,

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:38.690
and how important that is.

00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:39.440
I think most men--

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:41.398
I don't know if any men
in the room can relate.

00:44:41.398 --> 00:44:45.200
But most men are not OK with
having that conversation,

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:49.770
or even considering
that conversation,

00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:51.870
considering being emotional.

00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:55.230
So you doing that, I
think, is really important.

00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:57.970
Do you wish something like
Head Talks existed for you

00:44:57.970 --> 00:44:58.800
about 10 years ago?

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:00.784
Is that a motivation
to create it?

00:45:00.784 --> 00:45:01.950
SPEAKER 3: Yeah, definitely.

00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:03.930
I mean, god, I was
lucky 10 years ago.

00:45:03.930 --> 00:45:07.880
You know, honestly, I
was in such a bad way.

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:10.650
I started on an
addiction unit, because I

00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:13.470
was so heavily self-medicating.

00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:16.380
And then depression.

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:19.020
I could easily have
died, if I'm honest.

00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:23.370
My life could have
not turned around.

00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:26.480
The stigma of mental
health was so strong then,

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:29.570
and I had no tools.

00:45:29.570 --> 00:45:33.060
And I wish I had been around.

00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:35.660
And in fact, on
the stigma thing,

00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:37.920
we can actually do a quick
test, because it is still

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:39.870
very, very alive.

00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:42.460
If you'd just all like to
stand up, just really quickly.

00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:43.480
I know it's boring.

00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:46.900
But if you'll all just stand up.

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:51.210
And if you stay
standing, like, if you've

00:45:51.210 --> 00:45:54.840
had a mental illness,
or a family member has.

00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:57.990
It could be addiction,
bulimia, depression, anxiety.

00:45:57.990 --> 00:46:02.900
You know, just stay
standing, basically.

00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:07.910
And then I want you to stay
standing if you've actually

00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:11.810
been able to talk openly about
having one of these conditions,

00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:15.740
or a family member.

00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:19.620
SPEAKER 1: If you have
been able to talk about it.

00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:22.310
OLIVER CHITTENDEN: So actually,
it's quite interesting.

00:46:22.310 --> 00:46:25.410
So the stigma is
still very prevalent.

00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:27.360
We've, kind of, seen it here.

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:31.680
There is still a stigma
around mental ill health.

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:35.140
And it's not just the
privileged backgrounds.

00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:36.870
Sit down everyone.

00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:39.570
It's not just a
privileged background.

00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:41.580
Factory workers in
the north, they're

00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:43.470
not going to go and
tell their bosses,

00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:46.350
or their parents about
feeling depressed, and things

00:46:46.350 --> 00:46:46.950
like that.

00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:49.890
It's across the board.

00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:53.610
Winston Churchill,
Abraham Lincoln.

00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:55.890
There are many,
many examples of it

00:46:55.890 --> 00:46:58.987
from the arts and
things like that.

00:46:58.987 --> 00:47:00.570
It is something
that's very prevalent.

00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:03.310
SPEAKER 1: That was amazing
only two people weren't

00:47:03.310 --> 00:47:05.760
standing at the first question.

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:10.140
Have you ever experienced any
level of mental health issues,

00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:10.800
illness?

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:11.610
OLIVER CHITTENDEN:
I think this is it.

00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:14.100
SPEAKER 1: Pretty much the
entire room was standing.

00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:17.130
OLIVER CHITTENDEN: I think
it's that human condition

00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:19.200
thing that we need to realize.

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:22.426
Is that we all have varying
degrees of mental health.

00:47:22.426 --> 00:47:24.300
You know, it's like we
mention mental health,

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:27.060
and we almost automatically
think that equals illness.

00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:28.170
It's actually not.

00:47:28.170 --> 00:47:29.580
It's just different
levels of it.

00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:34.800
So if we can learn how to
keep our resilience going,

00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:37.320
because there are going to be
challenges in all our lives.

00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:39.444
But it's just being able
to lean on the things that

00:47:39.444 --> 00:47:41.820
work for us to rebuild
when we need to,

00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:44.910
and to be able to
cope in a pretty--

00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:47.800
we need to be adapting
with the times.

00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:51.030
We've left the mind behind.

00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:53.130
SPEAKER 1: So this is
your personal toolbox

00:47:53.130 --> 00:47:57.232
but you have a toolbox
to share with everybody.

00:47:57.232 --> 00:47:59.190
OLIVER CHITTENDEN: This
is just, like, a very--

00:47:59.190 --> 00:48:00.430
SPEAKER 1: Overview.

00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:02.930
OLIVER CHITTENDEN: Oh,
this is something I say.

00:48:02.930 --> 00:48:05.640
I always say there's
no magic pill,

00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:07.870
otherwise I would have found it.

00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:11.240
But if you go on
to the next slide.

00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:15.180
So again, it's not
complicated stuff.

00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:20.730
But it's just things to,
kind of, think about.

00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:23.295
You can read that.

00:48:23.295 --> 00:48:25.170
SPEAKER 1: Because I
think what you're about,

00:48:25.170 --> 00:48:30.960
Oliver, is not having
people hit rock bottom

00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:32.022
before they seek help

00:48:32.022 --> 00:48:33.730
OLIVER CHITTENDEN:
Yeah, I think that's--

00:48:33.730 --> 00:48:34.740
SPEAKER 1: I mean,
the reason why

00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:37.440
you got Head Talks, the reason
why you're showing this slide,

00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:41.305
is because you, kind
of, want people to--

00:48:41.305 --> 00:48:43.280
you want to alert them
to getting conscious.

00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:45.760
Maybe there's something
on the way for me.

00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:48.180
Maybe I'm sliding
down to rock bottom

00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:49.950
if I don't do anything about it.

00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:50.580
OLIVER CHITTENDEN: I
think there's that.

00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:52.538
And there's also, actually,
what's interesting,

00:48:52.538 --> 00:48:54.500
I think equally
interesting, is actually

00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:58.260
I could feel a lot better than
I do if I just try that out.

00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:01.270
Like we're sometimes
living on a level.

00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:02.800
And we think, oh I'm OK.

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:03.840
I'm all right with this.

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:07.475
But actually, you go and dive
in the Arctic Ocean, and think,

00:49:07.475 --> 00:49:08.350
god I feel brilliant.

00:49:08.350 --> 00:49:10.874
And you know, you feel 20%.

00:49:10.874 --> 00:49:12.040
It's like why wouldn't you--

00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:12.960
SPEAKER 1: It's like surviving
to thriving, isn't it?

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:13.245
OLIVER CHITTENDEN: Yeah.

00:49:13.245 --> 00:49:14.310
SPEAKER 1: Like, why not?

00:49:14.310 --> 00:49:15.310
OLIVER CHITTENDEN: Yeah.

00:49:15.310 --> 00:49:17.250
It's like why not try
things out that could

00:49:17.250 --> 00:49:19.416
make you feel a lot better,
do you know what I mean?

00:49:19.416 --> 00:49:21.840
But absolutely, the
prevention thing is key.

00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:26.340
And it's a really exciting
time for mental health

00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:31.770
now, because the stigma,
the lid is lifting slowly.

00:49:31.770 --> 00:49:34.820
But we're just so behind, in
terms of what we give people.

00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:41.620
And as I said earlier, it just
needs to be rethought through,

00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:42.316
re-innovated.

00:49:42.316 --> 00:49:44.190
I mean, you go to the
Scandinavian countries,

00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:47.850
and the way they're leading
not only their health services,

00:49:47.850 --> 00:49:52.350
but their societies, the focus
is much more on community,

00:49:52.350 --> 00:49:53.700
on happiness.

00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:57.750
Some countries have
ministers for happiness now.

00:49:57.750 --> 00:49:59.546
And I think it's great.

00:49:59.546 --> 00:50:01.170
I was actually at a
conference recently

00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:03.420
with the former prime
minister of Finland.

00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:05.430
A guy called Alex Stubb.

00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:09.220
And unlike most other
former prime ministers

00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:11.430
he actually will only
speak about happiness.

00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:13.680
He doesn't want to
talk about politics.

00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:17.400
And it was amazing hearing
him talk about this,

00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:22.610
and how this should be
front topic, on the top,

00:50:22.610 --> 00:50:25.324
in government.

00:50:25.324 --> 00:50:26.806
SPEAKER 1: So what's next?

00:50:26.806 --> 00:50:28.254
Where are you taking it now?

00:50:28.254 --> 00:50:29.670
OLIVER CHITTENDEN:
So, just keep--

00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:31.290
SPEAKER 1: What about Q And A.

00:50:31.290 --> 00:50:33.510
OLIVER CHITTENDEN:
Just keep working.

00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:35.070
Yeah.

00:50:35.070 --> 00:50:37.460
Head Talks is just
going to keep going.

00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:38.280
Follow the journey.

00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:40.940
We want to take people
on more of a journey.

00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:44.250
But if anyone's got any
questions while I'm here,

00:50:44.250 --> 00:50:50.520
please feel free to ask
any questions you like.

00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:52.920
SPEAKER 1: Do you have
time to ask them now, or--

00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:55.004
OLIVER CHITTENDEN: Yeah.

00:50:55.004 --> 00:50:57.820
AUDIENCE: It's been interesting
hearing about your journey.

00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:01.780
And you talked a lot about,
almost over-achievement,

00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:03.870
but like, that real pushing.

00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:07.860
And I wonder how you
approach your work now, like,

00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:09.730
post your healing?

00:51:09.730 --> 00:51:12.045
Do you feel that you take
a different approach?

00:51:12.045 --> 00:51:13.920
Because I guess there
wasn't lots in your two

00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:16.607
books around how you work.

00:51:16.607 --> 00:51:18.690
I mean, I've also, kind
of, come from a background

00:51:18.690 --> 00:51:20.910
of like working
really crazy hours,

00:51:20.910 --> 00:51:23.425
and then from coming to
Google, trying to re-adjust.

00:51:23.425 --> 00:51:25.410
But I can still find
I have a tendency

00:51:25.410 --> 00:51:28.434
to want to do too much, or
to keep up with my peers.

00:51:28.434 --> 00:51:29.850
So I just it'd be
interesting hear

00:51:29.850 --> 00:51:32.607
if you've got any tools
around work-life balance.

00:51:32.607 --> 00:51:33.940
SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE] question.

00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:36.390
OLIVER CHITTENDEN:
Yeah no, I mean, I

00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:38.640
get caught up in it like
everyone else still.

00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:45.600
And I get overwhelmed,
and I get stressed.

00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:48.562
And I don't stop enough.

00:51:48.562 --> 00:51:53.430
I've learned to, kind of,
digitally detox a little bit.

00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:56.670
So I really kind
of set times around

00:51:56.670 --> 00:51:59.460
when I turn my phone
off, when I get home,

00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:02.070
and when I turn it
on in the morning.

00:52:02.070 --> 00:52:04.140
There's actually
some scientific proof

00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:06.450
that shows that
dopamine is released

00:52:06.450 --> 00:52:08.184
when you receive messages.

00:52:08.184 --> 00:52:10.350
You actually feel excited
because someone wants you,

00:52:10.350 --> 00:52:12.350
and is like sending messages.

00:52:12.350 --> 00:52:14.805
So there's this addiction,
almost like smoking.

00:52:14.805 --> 00:52:16.900
And I'm sure they knew
about that before they

00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:18.890
invented all these things.

00:52:18.890 --> 00:52:21.880
So it's creating some
control over the digital side

00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:22.380
of things.

00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:25.740
And we've actually done
a talk on digital detox.

00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:29.160
Got an expert to
do a talk on that.

00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:31.740
And it's just taking
myself out of my head,

00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:35.430
and onto the tennis
court, into the spa,

00:52:35.430 --> 00:52:40.475
into the gym, spending
time with my family.

00:52:40.475 --> 00:52:43.350
But being really disciplined
around the digital, for me,

00:52:43.350 --> 00:52:43.980
is massive.

00:52:47.010 --> 00:52:49.590
You know, again,
mindfulness, meditation.

00:52:49.590 --> 00:52:54.900
That's a really personal
moment of my own to cherish.

00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:57.118
Peace and quiet.

00:52:57.118 --> 00:52:58.430
Thank you everyone.

00:52:58.430 --> 00:52:59.430
I hope you enjoyed that.

00:52:59.430 --> 00:53:01.971
SPEAKER 1: I thought we would've
been kicked out of the room.

00:53:01.971 --> 00:53:04.130
OLIVER CHITTENDEN:
Have a great day.
