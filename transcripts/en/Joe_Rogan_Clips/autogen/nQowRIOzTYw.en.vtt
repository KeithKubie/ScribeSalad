show we've got 21 minutes and then in
 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.530 align:start position:0%

talk about some four six minutes before
we<00:04:54.980><c> have</c><00:04:55.040><c> to</c><00:04:55.130><c> move</c><00:04:55.310><c> on</c><00:04:55.520><c> right</c><00:04:55.970><c> and</c><00:04:56.270><c> so</c><00:04:56.960><c> that's</c>

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 align:start position:0%
we have to move on right and so that's

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 align:start position:0%
the that's the only limitation that we
