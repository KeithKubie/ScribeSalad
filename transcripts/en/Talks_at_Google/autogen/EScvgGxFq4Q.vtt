JAMES MULCAHY: In case
you guys don't know me,

00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:01.750
I'm James Mulcahy.

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:04.680
I work for Zagat, which
is owned by Google.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.550
I'm the executive video
producer for all the Zagat

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.550
videos that we do around
the country on YouTube.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.020
So I was super excited,
because I work with YouTube all

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.900
the time, to be interviewing
Chef Maangchi today,

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.840
who, as you probably know, if
you didn't have her [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.080
already, is a YouTube sensation,
with over 670,000 subscribers,

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.990
videos about Korean cooking,
and a new cookbook that

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.950
just came out.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.849
Which is what she's here
to talk about today.

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.390
So I'm going to give the floor
to her for a little bit so she

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.950
can tell you the background and
how she got started and about

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:34.960
her book a little bit.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.960
Then I'll chat with her
and ask a few questions.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.450
And then, of course,
we're excited to have

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.550
everyone in the audience
ask questions today.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.170
I think I see a few
trays, actually,

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.110
probably from the Truck Pit
that have her food in it.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.480
So do you want to get started?

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.980
MAANGCHI: Yeah,
thank you, James.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.290
Thank you, guys, thank you
for coming to see me here.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.270
And so today's my
very special day.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:56.860
My special day, why?

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.880
A few years ago, 2011,
I came here exactly.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.379
And at Google, this office,
I made Korean shaved ice

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:06.750
with a sweet red bean.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.270
It's called patbingsu.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.640
And this is for 200 employees.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.860
I made this with other
my YouTube creators.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:14.940
That was a big hit.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:21.410
So and then now, four years
later, 2011, this year, 2015, I

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.870
came here with my cookbook.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.080
See?

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.870
Look at that.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:26.810
Hey.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:27.870
You know.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.670
This is YouTube.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.280
I mean, YouTube and Google.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.810
They saved my life.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.950
And in 2007 the first time I
posted my video on YouTube.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.820
I'm teaching Korean
cooking through my video.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.000
And then at the
time I never knew

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.240
that this kind of a
success would be coming.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.140
But now it is exactly
like 2011 I came,

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.960
2015 with my own cookbook.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.735
This book is made with Tapnotes
Publishing Company, Houghton

00:01:57.735 --> 00:01:59.000
Mifflin.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.820
And the best of the best editor,
my cowriter, all book people.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.150
I cannot imagine.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.440
I couldn't imagine.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.380
So this book has sold all
around the world at bookshops.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.700
So this is real success.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.050
Without Google and YouTube
company, I couldn't make it.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.910
Plus, my reader, my audience
who trust my recipe.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.120
So they love, love,
love my recipe.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.840
All around the world
they learn Korean cooking

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.210
from my website and my video.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.320
That's why I'm here.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.220
And also on other
things, I'm very honored

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.840
to sit here today is that
you guys taste my food.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.970
I didn't make it.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.010
Your Google chef,
I made Google chef

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.920
cook my recipes from cookbook.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.550
Can you imagine?

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.770
Oh, my god, this is very
success, successful.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.100
So when I started my video
for the first time in 2007,

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.500
I was working as a family
counselor in Toronto, Canada.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.750
My mom said, Mom,
I'm busy these days

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.380
and I'm doing some
YouTube video.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.200
My mom said, what
about your job?

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.350
My mom is kind of really
reluctant to encourage me.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.260
But now my story about me
was in "New York Times,"

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.980
a huge article recently.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.840
My book was published
May 19 this year.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.110
And then "New York Times,"
the article about me,

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.810
huge in the story.

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.060
And then my mom is
living in LA, Koreatown.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.280
She doesn't understand English.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.730
Her friends always
speaking Korean.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.620
Her friends, hey, your daughter
is in the Korean "Hanguk Ilbo,"

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.940
the "Hanguk Ilbo" is
the Korean newspaper

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.430
in LA and in all America.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.880
They translate, basically,
oh, Maangchi is Korean born.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.720
This is the "New York Times,"
and "New York Times" reporter

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.090
said, blah, blah, blah.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.100
And then now my mom
is so proud of me.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.010
She said, oh, I'm
Maangchi's mom.

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.900
So she's so proud
of me these days.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.880
So things have
changed like this.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:11.160
And today I tasted the recipes
from my cookbook food made.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.670
Korean black bean noodles.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.610
You know, did you taste
black bean noodles?

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.519
Black sauce, kind of noodles
on top, kind of black noodles.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:19.570
Oh, my god.

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.630
I gave a lot, a lot of co
compliment this to your chef

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.280
because so tasty.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.420
And they said, oh, this is
easy, easy to follow because you

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.660
made the really nice cookbook.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.850
And also your japchae, stuffed
fried noodles with vegetables,

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.500
so good.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.120
Also multigrain rice.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.490
That's my cookbook recipe.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.170
Oh, my god.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.970
And of all the dishes I
tasted, this is awesome.

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.350
And you know, how much
I'm honored to be here.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:51.480
Think about this.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.000
Four years ago, not many
people trusted my recipe.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.800
But I'm here as a cookbook
author in the mainstream.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.080
In the mainstream, people
acknowledge my ability,

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.170
and then I'm just sitting here.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.900
OK.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.240
I just talked about my
story, what I did in Korea.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.130
I was born, raised,
and lived in Korea.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.420
And also I cooked for my
family for years and years.

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:23.140
I'm just the typical Korean
housewife who loves cooking.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.530
And when I was young,
ever since I was young,

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.080
I was very, very interested
in delicious food.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.085
You guys interested
in delicious food?

00:05:31.085 --> 00:05:32.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.750
I met some guys I met in
New York a few years ago.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.620
He said, I don't like food.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.000
So kind of rare.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.330
I don't like food, but,
you know, I just thought,

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.000
OK, you should be hungry.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.360
Maybe you will love.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.000
Anyway, when I was
in Korea, I never

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.050
went to any culinary school.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.530
I never learned, actually,
recipe from any cookbook.

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.060
All the recipes are
just naturally cooking,

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.070
home cooking.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.990
And from my mom, my
grandmothers, two grandmothers,

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.860
two sides, both sides,
my aunts and relatives.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.730
Even marketplace.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.040
And then when I
taste something good,

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.090
and then I got to
learn how to make it.

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:16.600
That's the difference.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.900
A lot of my friends,
they love delicious food,

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.800
but they don't want to
learn how to make it.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.900
But in my case, I want to learn.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.260
My eyes are just on fire,
oh, how can I make it?

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:32.910
And if I taste it, really tasty,
I come home, try to recreate.

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.050
And then luckily I
can taste some food,

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.420
and then I know that, hm, how
it's made, hm, what's inside.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.020
I can figure out easily.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:48.070
So ever since I was young, like,
my whole families, my mom's

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:51.640
side, aunts, and then
when I taste it, like,

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.710
who is the best
version of each dish?

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.980
I can just acquire to determine.

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:00.670
And then for example,
there's a Korean some kind

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.530
of soup every day.

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:04.540
Everybody loves
this kind of soup.

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.480
Soybean sprout soup.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.770
Because it sounds good?

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:08.740
Very healthy.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:09.955
Soybean sprout soup.

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:18.960
I visited my aunt's house, my
aunt, my mom's younger sister's

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:19.800
house.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:24.320
Two hours distance from
where I used to live.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:29.420
And then my aunt gave me this
Korean soybean sprout soup.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.420
Different.

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:31.570
I taste it.

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:34.210
And she added dried anchovies.

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:38.080
And to make that like
really umami food taste,

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.820
savory, make it savory.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.480
And also she added some
hot pepper flakes there

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.740
and some onion, chopped onion.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:50.910
Plus, and she
cooked that, ground

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:53.110
toasted sesame seeds on top.

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:59.820
And then I was going to eat
my meal, my aunt said, wait.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:03.840
And with this rice, you
need this radish kimchi.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.350
So radish kimchi coming.

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:10.420
Radish kimchi was a little
fermented, so it tastes tangy.

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:11.300
Crunchy.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.510
So I added.

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:16.560
My aunt asked me
how to eat this.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.590
Oh, my god, unbelievable.

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:20.640
This is so, so tasty.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.860
Much better than
my mom's version.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:26.110
So ever since then, my
[INAUDIBLE] cook soybean

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:28.880
sprout soup is that
that's my recipe.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.300
But I may change my
mind maybe tomorrow

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.250
if I taste someone else's
soybean sprout soup.

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:36.370
Better than this recipe.

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:37.400
I got to learn.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.890
And then I got to
share this recipe

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:42.140
with my readers, my audience.

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:45.880
And these recipes are
all posted on my website.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.830
So all the readers,
they love, love

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:53.250
my-- some kind of an authentic
way, my recipes, they love it.

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:58.680
They just test my recipe
and they trusted my recipe.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:03.070
I told you I never studied
at any culinary school.

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:07.820
Actually, I have a master's
degree in education.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.080
I studied the
philosophy of education.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.260
And I used to teach at
university where I studied.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.240
And also when I was
in Korea, I used

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:20.530
to be an English teacher later,
and translator, interpreter.

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:27.040
And later, I had
the chance from 1992

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:34.210
to 1995 and for three
years, with my family,

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:36.530
we came to Missouri, Columbia.

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:40.366
You know Columbia,
Missouri, small city.

00:09:40.366 --> 00:09:42.740
JAMES MULCAHY: Anyone from
Columbia, Missouri, out there?

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.160
MAANGCHI: Columbia, Missouri?

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.210
Anybody who is-- Kansas?

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:49.880
It's the middle.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.720
Like the middle of America.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:58.380
So when I was there, I
met a lot of Korean expat.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.920
So Korean expat,
Korean housewives.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.690
And then they mostly-- they
are students at the Columbia

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:04.860
university.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:09.670
And then we met
almost every weekend

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:12.500
at the park and potluck dish.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.560
So this potluck dish, I
have to bring one dish.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.240
Like today you had japchae?

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.390
I bring japchae.

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:21.860
So usually we do at the
park Korean barbecue.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:26.250
And somebody bring the kimchi,
somebody bring the side dish

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:27.970
or vegetable dish.

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:32.140
And then we make this all
nice, nice, nice potluck party.

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:34.750
And some dishes that
I never tasted here

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:38.240
because I was
growing up, I grew up

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:42.240
in the really southern
part, cities, southern food.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:45.170
It was a small country,
but still there

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:50.340
are like some of the
area, different provinces.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:57.090
So I came from really south, the
city named Yeosu, harbor city.

00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:01.520
So that when I was in Missouri
and some food, like chicken,

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.580
fried sticky chicken
called dakgangjeong.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.240
I had never tasted before.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:11.380
But somebody came from different
region from where I lived,

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:12.850
she just taught me.

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:18.390
I had to learn because it's so,
so tasty, crunchy like candy.

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:23.100
These kind of things all
my life long, like recipes

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.980
are coming this region
from that region.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.870
Even I'm just moving
around, though.

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:31.320
Until junior high school I lived
in southern part in my city.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:35.800
But from high school, my
parents sent me to Seoul.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.750
To be successful you've
got to go to Seoul.

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:42.280
So from Seoul and then
university, graduate school.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:46.440
And then so I had a chance
to taste all different region

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.340
and food.

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:52.900
And then I collect some
recipes one by one for myself.

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.050
I had never thought
about YouTube.

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:59.630
That someday I would
be a YouTube cook.

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:01.370
I never expected at the time.

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:03.900
Probably if I had known
that, I would have learned

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:05.315
more, more passionately.

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:15.410
And then 2002, I immigrate
to Canada, Canada, Toronto.

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:17.040
I did all kind of job.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:20.090
First I studied with cashier.

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:22.770
So cashier, my next
door, I went there.

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:24.230
To manager, who is manager?

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:25.350
And the manager came.

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:27.790
So I want to work here.

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:29.230
Can I work here?

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:31.700
So what can you do? he asked me.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:35.440
So I said I can do
computer, typing.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:39.730
And he says, what we
need is the person who

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:42.270
can carry heavy stuff.

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:43.750
Loading and unloading.

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:45.920
So I said, OK anyway.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:50.610
So my resume is
kind of not useful.

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:53.470
Because graduate
school, who cares?

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:54.370
Immigrant.

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:56.820
Even my English is not perfect.

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.010
So anyway, I came home.

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:01.500
And the boss, he
called me in one week.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.960
He said, oh, you want
to become a cashier?

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.020
Sure.

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.480
And then I did cashier.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.680
I learned a lot.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.579
I mean, whatever
I did in my life,

00:13:09.579 --> 00:13:11.120
I learned that there
are a lot of us.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:16.230
And one example, I learned when
I was working as a cashier,

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:17.290
is that, like, water.

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:20.010
Water is a small battery.

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:21.730
Tons of tax charge.

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:25.320
But large battery
don't charge tax.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:26.600
So I don't know why.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.070
I think we make
sense a little bit.

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:31.460
Some people kind of about it,
a pretentious person, you know.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:33.860
I'm willing to pay
for small battery.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.650
OK, you deserve to pay more.

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:38.160
But large battery,
probably family member

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.190
is waiting for this water.

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:42.300
I don't know, this
is only my theory.

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:43.750
So kind of a small thing.

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:47.730
How to make a sandwich, North
American-style sandwich.

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:49.690
I'm just all the time learning.

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:51.750
And I try to sell my chicken.

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:52.720
Wow.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.300
I'm so ambitious, right?

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:56.070
The guy's name.

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:59.570
I'll never forget the
manager because he helped me.

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:00.930
You know?

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:03.590
One day I asked
him, hey, Frank, I

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:05.520
can make some Korean
fried chicken.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.370
Everybody knocked down
when they taste my chicken.

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:11.170
So can I bring some of
my chicken you can taste?

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:12.050
And they, sure.

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:13.270
So I brought it.

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:16.630
I made all kinds of,
but I just work hard.

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:19.430
And then, but he couldn't
eat any one piece.

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:21.410
Because there's a peanut.

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:23.440
He has a peanut allergy.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:28.880
But all of my other cashiers,
my coworkers, they love it.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:29.460
They love it.

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.570
And then they ask
to me, can I order?

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:34.790
Can I order some Korean
seaweed rice roll, gimbap.

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:39.250
So actually I used to
sell a few people later.

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:45.840
And when I worked there, also
I was working as a movie extra.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:49.020
And movie extra in the
movie named "How To Deal."

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:53.180
Have you ever seen the movie?

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:54.310
I came home.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:58.260
And then memorizing English
is very difficult for me.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:02.160
Sometimes backward I memorize.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.740
People ask me, who was he?

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:07.850
Oh, I just got a job today.

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:12.130
I went there and then so I
did a movie, "How to Deal."

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:14.640
They asked me, who was in?

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:15.640
Who's in there?

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.340
So I don't remember.

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:20.170
You know the guy
named Peter Gallagher.

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:23.300
You know that Peter Gallagher?

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:26.580
What happened to you guys?

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:29.010
So his name's later.

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:32.110
I always, like, forget his name.

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:34.890
People ask me, his
name's Peter Gallagher.

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:37.860
Also the girl's name
I forgot totally.

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:40.110
She's more famous
than Peter Gallagher.

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:43.520
And then eventually
how I never forget

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.840
is that about Peter Gallagher
sounds like a galley.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:50.800
So OK, Peter plus a galley,
and then never forget.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.800
And then in Canada
I was working.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.850
Also I used to teach English
to Korean immigrants.

00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:02.200
And also later I got a good
job at nonprofit organization

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.430
as a family counselor.

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:05.290
I worked there for three years.

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:08.260
And then before I
came to America.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.830
And then I become
Canadian citizen.

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:14.580
And then, now, in
2000-- when is it,

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:19.700
'08, I came to America to
lead a more adventurous life.

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:23.730
And this is my making
video and also making video

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:25.220
and running my website.

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:27.620
This is my full-time job.

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:31.250
So this is a very
fascinating story.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:33.560
People ask me,
where are you from?

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.560
And then I know what he means.

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.400
They see my face, right?

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.980
So even though I am
legally Canadian,

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:42.680
I always say, I'm Korean.

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.410
But legally, Canadian.

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:47.950
But waiting for my
green card in America.

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:57.010
So this is like
my life's journey.

00:16:57.010 --> 00:17:00.540
So I'm always interested
in learning something new.

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:02.730
And also especially food.

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:06.250
Food is normally the way I
live, normally to what I did.

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:08.369
Food is always in my heart.

00:17:08.369 --> 00:17:12.230
Some delicious food I find, I've
got to learn how to make it.

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:15.790
So this is where I am now.

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:19.180
So I made this cookbook.

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:21.540
So you guys found my cookbook.

00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:28.329
Let me tell you how I got
involved with this making

00:17:28.329 --> 00:17:30.120
cookbook.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.100
My website, my website.

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:39.410
2000-- Oh, I didn't talk about
how I made the YouTube video.

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:41.150
I have my son.

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:45.640
My son was a computer, at the
time, computer science student.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:49.190
He asked me, Mom, have
ever heard about YouTube?

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:51.340
So yes I have.

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:52.850
He says, why don't you?

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:55.600
Why don't you share
your recipes on YouTube?

00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:00.060
Probably you'll be so popular
because your food is delicious

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:03.770
and also never-- your
content will never run out.

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:04.730
That's true.

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:06.570
The content never runs out.

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:09.730
I see a lot of YouTube
creators, like at the beginning,

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:12.780
oh, they did it, and
then later, oh, there's

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:14.260
nothing to show anymore.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:14.760
Right?

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:18.650
So cooking is just my
lifetime, really, passion.

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:23.460
So that's why I was very
interested in his idea.

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:26.430
But I was not sure how.

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:29.730
I mean, just only I have a cheap
camera, a really cheap camera

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:34.840
with just a little digital
camera with a video function.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.160
But how can I do?

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.080
How can I edit?

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.610
How can I film?

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:39.520
You know, no idea.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.190
But like around a
few weeks later,

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:44.780
I decided, sounds
like really fun.

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:46.620
So let's do.

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:53.280
And in April 2007, I posted my
first video, spicy stuffed rice

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.710
squid.

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:57.760
I wanted to surprise
my reader, my audience.

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:03.050
I just brought it from Chinatown
or Korean grocery store.

00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:05.880
Huge frozen squid.

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:09.080
And then in front of the
camera, I just cut it in half

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:10.870
and then take the guts out.

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:16.230
And then in the meanwhile, I was
washing and stir fry and spicy.

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:20.390
And then my gas detector
is going ring, ring, ring.

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:23.497
And then behind me, background,
I did this, I see this,

00:19:23.497 --> 00:19:24.330
and I'm, oh, my god.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:25.380
Embarrassing.

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:26.760
Behind me and the kimchi.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.150
I was going to make a kimchi.

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:30.720
And salting the cabbages there.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:33.670
And even I didn't think
about background, background.

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:34.760
And the music.

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.630
Even just without
any permission.

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:39.710
Even I didn't know
that's, like, illegal.

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:42.170
[INAUDIBLE] say music
and then put this music

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:44.540
because at the time
that's my favorite music.

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:46.810
And then I made it,
OK, sounds good.

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:47.470
Looks good.

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:49.380
And then I went to bed.

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:52.850
Next day I work, but I was
really doubting, you know.

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:53.940
Who's going to watch this?

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:55.750
How can they find me?

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:59.650
Actually, next day, many people
subscribe, subscribe to me.

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:02.860
And then they said, oh,
my god, this looks good.

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:04.614
Someone already made this.

00:20:04.614 --> 00:20:05.280
Can you imagine?

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.220
Someone already
followed my recipe.

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:11.450
And then they also said all
kinds of good encouragement,

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:12.390
nice comments.

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:14.880
Plus, next a request.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.190
Can you make a Korean
bean paste stew?

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:17.950
Korean kimchi?

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:19.600
Korean bulgogi?

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:20.950
So whoa!

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:22.210
This is so fun!

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:25.720
People are just-- these
guys are really my friends.

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:28.900
And before doing this,
I had another hobby.

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:33.210
Kind of internet, like, that's
why I got my name, Maangchi.

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:35.260
Maangchi is a hammer in Korean.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:38.050
My real Korean name is
Kim [? Guang-su, ?] Kim

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:40.840
[? Guang-su. ?] Nobody
pronounce it very correctly.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:45.890
So Maangchi, I got this name
because the city over here,

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:49.800
also online game, I was
like wielding some hammer,

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.970
and then huge-- this.

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:58.350
All throw away my stress by
playing my game, online game.

00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:01.000
And then around that, even
I made some good friends.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.760
Still we keep in contact.

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:08.750
So people from Montreal, and
people from LA, and Singapore.

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:13.220
Sometimes we used to play a
game like some task force.

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:16.930
You know, task force means that
you can't go to bathroom even

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:19.600
for three hours until you
finish this cave mission,

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:22.300
you can't get out of there.

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:24.290
And then I used to do this.

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:29.750
But this cooking video is
kind of more fun for me.

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:32.570
Because these people are
real people who cook,

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:34.050
follow my recipe.

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:36.915
And then, OK, first
I kind of half

00:21:36.915 --> 00:21:43.610
of my hour, the leftover hour is
for my game, half is for this.

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:45.010
So I couldn't sleep much.

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:47.430
Sometimes like a
Saturday, all day

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:49.640
play game plus making video.

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:54.470
So anyway, sooner
or later, I was

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:56.230
chosen as a YouTube partner.

00:21:56.230 --> 00:22:00.040
At that time or today,
you become a partner

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:02.050
and then you can get paid.

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:04.020
But these days
everybody, I think,

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:05.740
they are YouTube partner.

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:09.580
So and then they gave me
partner of some kind of a medal.

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:13.130
So medal was probably, you
guys heard about this, medal;

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:15.000
is right next to my channel.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.570
So really motivating me to
work harder, more and more.

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:24.710
Ever since that time I
keep posting my video.

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:28.510
And then a few months
later, I made my website

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:31.460
because I really need
a home on the internet.

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:36.590
Because some of my
YouTube audience said, oh,

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:39.050
how can I find this
Korean ingredients?

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:40.360
What is it?

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.380
And also like, what--
so a lot of things

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:45.100
to talk about in like tips.

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:49.120
When you make especially this
thing, it's 20 minutes, like,

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:49.980
seasoning things.

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:50.634
So why?

00:22:50.634 --> 00:22:52.050
Something like
this I needed this.

00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:55.280
So I really needed
to make my website.

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.810
So I made this, maangchi.com.

00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:00.930
And then ingredients photo.

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:03.410
And then kitchenware photo.

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:06.850
Where to find Korean
cooking grocery stores.

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:08.560
Where can you find.

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:12.340
And then my readers
today, they submit.

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:14.510
OK, this is my
favorite Korean store.

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:17.390
And they just submit
the information.

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:22.670
And then all this my website
is gradually increased,

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:25.130
keep getting bigger and bigger.

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:28.360
And then eventually some
people send me photo.

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.550
Maangchi, I made you a chicken.

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:35.570
My chicken, and
it was a big hit.

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:36.840
I went to the party.

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:38.960
Everybody asked me
where I learned.

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.340
I talk about you.

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:43.430
And then, oh, my god,
You saved my life.

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:45.650
So many touching stories I got.

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:51.310
Someone married
the Korean husband.

00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:54.270
The American lady who
married the Korean husband.

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:58.340
And then recently they
don't get along well.

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:00.840
Kind of a partly p
food or cultural thing.

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:03.610
So the lady found my recipe.

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:07.290
She made the Korean bean
paste soup for husband.

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:11.292
Husband said, oh, my god,
this is my mom's food.

00:24:11.292 --> 00:24:12.250
Where did you get this?

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:18.420
And then not only food by
itself but also the wife

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:21.610
is working harder
to get along well,

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:23.620
to get a better relationship.

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:28.250
That's the kind that will make
the husband really feel better.

00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:29.440
So they get along.

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.560
So anyway, this
kind of story, there

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:32.790
are tons and tons of stories.

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:36.310
Every morning I wake
up, I read email.

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:40.360
And through all my social
media and all the time

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:41.620
I encourage them.

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:44.190
I'm empowered.

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:48.230
So this thing is that,
you know, my website

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:50.380
is getting bigger and bigger.

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:52.450
I just made another section.

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:54.120
And it's Korean food photo.

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:56.960
You guys make it because
they send me an email.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:00.120
This is the noodle soup that
I made with your recipe.

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.540
And they show me.

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:05.560
To send to me it
takes time and effort.

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:09.710
They have to use Photoshop
so they have to do something.

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:10.860
They send me.

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:12.200
And I just go, wow.

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.490
This one I've got to
share with more people.

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:17.990
So I made it a Korean
food photo section.

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:19.080
So this photo.

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:20.900
You make my recipe.

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:24.690
And then if you have a story,
or it doesn't matter, no story.

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:29.000
Just post it directly from
your computer, post it.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.920
And now so for thousands
and thousands of photos

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.920
are on my website.

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.310
This is my treasure.

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:37.230
This is my treasure.

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:41.380
And then later my readers,
they become friends.

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:44.470
These guys are like
Korean perilla leaves.

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:46.750
You guys know about
Korean perilla leaves?

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:48.150
It's called kkaennip.

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:52.400
So anyway, so perilla leaves.

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:55.840
I make a perilla leaf
kimchi, perilla leaf pickle.

00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:02.460
And then somebody says that,
oh, I found it in my yard.

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:04.310
I thought that
this is like weed.

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:06.640
All the time, every
year, I got rid of these.

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.190
I just said got rid of these.

00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:10.450
They're so, so be alive.

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:13.320
And next year
again coming alive.

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:15.940
So they would really
get tired of this kind

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:19.720
of precious vegetable
for Koreans.

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:23.760
I pay, I paid $2, $3 for
a really small package

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:25.190
in a Korean store.

00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:27.730
But some people are
just, perilla leaves,

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:29.850
they throw away.

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:32.120
And we talk about
perilla leaves.

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:34.230
And then some people
say, oh, I don't know.

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:36.220
I'm living in the
middle of nowhere.

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:38.110
I cannot find a Korean store.

00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:40.050
How can I find perilla leaves?

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:42.230
Oh, my god, I'd like to taste.

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:44.040
And then my reader,
another reader,

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.570
OK, I will send you
the package of seed.

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:48.400
So he send it to her.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.050
So these guys became friends.

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:54.890
So I thought that maybe it's
time for me to make a meeting

00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:56.960
place through my website.

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.240
So I made the forum.

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:00.790
So through the forum
they talk with each other

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:03.670
and then they share
their know-how.

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:07.200
So some people are making
kimchi at the beginning,

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.310
seven years ago.

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:11.910
When she started kimchi, she
asked me, she's bugging me,

00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:16.090
hey, you made 10
pounds of kimchi.

00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:18.150
How about 1 pound of kimchi?

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:20.440
Can you give me a
recipe, only small,

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.680
1 pound of kimchi recipe?

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:25.040
This is unbelievable for me.

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:29.690
As a Korean, we make kimchi
like with 20, 20 heads of Napa

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:30.640
cabbage I make.

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:33.000
Even I never know
what's the pound?

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.330
What's the big deal?

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:36.690
Usually Korean
cabbages are huge.

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:38.600
Chinatown cabbages are so small.

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:41.090
I don't know where
they find this one.

00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:43.870
Korean Napa cabbages are huge.

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:48.350
So some people ask me,
please, cut down the recipe.

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:51.420
And give me only one
cabbage, Napa cabbage.

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:53.990
I don't know from what to say.

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:55.290
OK.

00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:58.400
Cabbage sizes are different.

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:03.690
Anyway, one of my readers,
she or he, many people.

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:06.090
They started with
only one cabbage,

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:09.340
but now they make
20 pounds of kimchi.

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:12.720
Because kimchi is not
exactly only a side dish.

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:16.510
With kimchi you can make
soup, stew, pancake.

00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:20.110
And steamed, you can add it
chopped too, the dumpling.

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:22.780
Every way you can make,
all kinds of dishes you

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:23.750
can make here.

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:27.010
So like Korean housewives.

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:29.860
When I lived in Missouri,
Columbia, I had a friend,

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:31.390
she's from China.

00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:34.420
And Miss [? Yui. ?] And Miss
[? Yui ?] came to my house

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:36.740
and opened my refrigerator.

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:39.170
Her eyes are like this, ooh!

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:40.655
This is kimchi?

00:28:40.655 --> 00:28:42.640
Kimchi?

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:43.329
Yes, kimchi.

00:28:43.329 --> 00:28:44.745
She couldn't believe
these Koreans

00:28:44.745 --> 00:28:46.840
are eating lot of kimchi.

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:48.430
This is the usual thing for me.

00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:50.040
Kimchis are like
a huge container,

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:52.830
these amount of a container.

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:56.270
But these days, my readers,
my audience, they love kimchi.

00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:57.630
They are making that amount.

00:28:57.630 --> 00:28:59.440
Some people are selling kimchi.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:05.210
Maangchi, I sell Korean
kimchi to Koreans now.

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:07.710
So my Brazilian
reader let me know

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:11.940
she's selling kimchi at the
Korean church to Koreans.

00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:14.920
So really fascinating
stories every day.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.240
I just always hear that.

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:22.610
And then some people
ask me, hey, Maangchi.

00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:26.410
Even though you just give
us recipe, I need the book.

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:30.380
I'd like to give it to somebody
who's not access to a computer.

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:33.250
And then I'd like to give
them the real written recipe.

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:34.980
So can you make a book?

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:37.490
But I never thought
about this kind of book.

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:38.960
I said, OK, sure.

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:42.240
And then I made
the PDF file, PDF.

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.470
And then in color.

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:45.020
With lots of color.

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:47.430
And then sold on Amazon.

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:50.520
So first I studied I
could give away for free.

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:54.560
So still you guys can
get downloaded for free.

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:58.430
Book 1, Book 2, 2,
3, Book 1, 2, 3.

00:29:58.430 --> 00:30:01.490
Even I never thought about
making real book at the time.

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:03.730
Just the people ask
me, oh, OK, sure.

00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:04.810
I will do that.

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:08.320
And then the book was
downloaded, millions

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.460
of people downloaded for free.

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:15.020
So actually, when I pitched my
book I just tell [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:18.140
So I asked my agent,
see, this is evidence.

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:20.630
My book, millions of
people downloaded,

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:22.620
even though that's free.

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:25.000
But the book, real
book, people who

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.660
want to get the real
book in their hands

00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:32.780
is that we made this PDF file
and then nice kind of sizes

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:33.950
are really small.

00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:36.770
But book price is so expensive.

00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:39.440
It should be because
I use the colorful.

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:40.840
Books should be colorful.

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:43.130
This is my theory
about cookbook.

00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:44.890
My theory about
cookbook is that you

00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:47.620
should have a lot of
colorful, nice photos

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:49.600
and step-by-step photos.

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.590
And so that I'm a visual person.

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:55.190
YouTube video, why I'm
making video, right?

00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.510
But problem is
they're expensive.

00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:01.170
$30 for this thing.

00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:03.650
I don't make much
money from this.

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:07.800
I imagine because otherwise I
need to make black and white.

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:10.300
So I don't like that idea,
black and white cookbook,

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:11.860
no matter what happens.

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:16.600
So anyway, someday I was
thinking that maybe someday I

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:17.990
should make a real cookbook.

00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:21.750
Because a real cookbook,
this book is much cheaper.

00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:27.310
And also prices are cheap plus
lot and lot of good people,

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:29.880
something like recipes
are almost the same.

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:35.400
But make you guys
understand them better.

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:41.816
For example, my cowriter,
her name is Lauren.

00:31:41.816 --> 00:31:44.790
I make a recipe
and I send to her.

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:49.210
And then she make a kind of--
basically I give her my jewel.

00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:51.060
And then she make
jewelry, right?

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:54.520
And then she's,
OK, Maangchi, you

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:58.770
said that you cover,
cover or uncover?

00:31:58.770 --> 00:32:00.120
You cooked for 50 minutes.

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:02.110
Covered or uncovered?

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:02.990
I was so frustrated.

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:04.130
What does she mean?

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:05.360
Of course, cover!

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:07.740
Inside I just thought, cover.

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:09.410
And then, yes, cover.

00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:11.750
I just swallow my frustration.

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:13.640
And then sometimes
it's, Maangchi,

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:18.160
it means that sesame oil
is toasted or untoasted?

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.220
Toasted.

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:22.830
In Korean cuisine,
always toasted.

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:25.830
Toasted sesame oil
is always, always.

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:28.790
Sesame seeds,
toasted or untoasted?

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:31.160
Always toasted.

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:37.900
And then also I was shocked when
another editor, Rory, his name

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:40.320
is, later he joined our team.

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:43.450
My book is made
with tons of people.

00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:45.810
Rory, he's a really
tough editor.

00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:52.750
He asked me, oh, Maangchi,
you made this beef jerky,

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:56.020
beef jerky you
guys should follow.

00:32:56.020 --> 00:33:00.660
If you get today your book,
if you're eating beef jerky,

00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:01.820
make it.

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:05.460
Everybody loves my beef jerky.

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:08.670
He asked me, how
many pieces of that?

00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:11.050
I mean, I don't remember.

00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:14.590
And also he said, this
is how many serving?

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:17.510
It depends on how much
you like that, right?

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:22.690
I mean, just like 3 pounds
of beef brisket I made this.

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:24.620
And then some
people, five people

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:26.550
eat just to finish
it in one time.

00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:30.340
Or just one person like a whole
cow save this for one year

00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:32.090
and then you can eat it.

00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:33.940
So making me so frustrated.

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:36.500
But you know, I was
always like swallowing.

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:38.260
[BREATH] Yeah, right.

00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:40.890
My cookbook buyer
later, cookbook buyer.

00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:43.540
Those guys all have
the same question,

00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:45.080
may have the same question.

00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:46.630
So that's right.

00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:48.150
I shouldn't feel frustrated.

00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:50.370
I should appreciate this.

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:53.080
And then actually,
eventually, I had

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:55.410
to make my beef jerky again.

00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:57.460
Exactly follow my recipe.

00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:58.330
Cut it.

00:33:58.330 --> 00:34:02.480
And then, OK, this is Rory.

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:05.930
And then this is my 30
or something like pieces.

00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:08.550
And then exactly.

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:11.190
And then I just
made three divided.

00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:16.810
And then one portion for Rory,
one portion for my cookbook

00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:20.020
cowriter, 1/3 is for myself.

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:22.870
And then I divided
it that evenly.

00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:28.190
And then I sent to
them the envelope.

00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:29.699
Rory, next day, he got it.

00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:31.750
Holy delicious, oh, my god.

00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:33.020
It's delicious.

00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:34.179
He made me.

00:34:34.179 --> 00:34:38.219
And my other
cookbook writer also.

00:34:38.219 --> 00:34:42.530
So when I make this
cookbook, I have a lot of,

00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:44.440
a lot of funny stories.

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:46.830
And I don't remember all.

00:34:46.830 --> 00:34:48.480
And then sometimes
I should write down.

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:49.909
Otherwise, I get older.

00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:51.340
I always forget.

00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:54.719
So this is like a long journey.

00:34:54.719 --> 00:35:00.000
But around four, five
years ago, eventually I

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.880
met the best of the best agent.

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:07.610
So this agent made it
possible to make my cookbook.

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:12.150
She found this all the
best publishing company

00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:13.930
and also cowriter.

00:35:13.930 --> 00:35:19.310
And also the food photo
designer and all everybody.

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:20.560
So kind of a set.

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:22.480
So I'm so lucky.

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:23.260
I'm so lucky.

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:25.370
First, why I'm lucky?

00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:27.460
I got involved with YouTube.

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:29.192
And Google guys.

00:35:29.192 --> 00:35:30.650
Google [INAUDIBLE]
to pay me money.

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:33.150
So this is my full-time job.

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:36.770
And then also my readers,
my reader audience.

00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:37.800
They trust me.

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:38.631
They love me.

00:35:38.631 --> 00:35:39.130
Right?

00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:40.480
And I'm lucky.

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:43.470
And now I'm just
invited to this.

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:47.220
They made, your chef
made today my recipe.

00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:50.710
How fascinating this
is, this story is.

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:52.830
I can keep going on.

00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:54.770
But I think that's enough.

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:56.604
That you guys ask
question, ask me question.

00:35:56.604 --> 00:35:57.978
JAMES MULCAHY: I
have a question.

00:35:57.978 --> 00:36:00.130
I mean, do you think
it became so popular

00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:02.620
so quickly because there's
a lack of knowledge or lack

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:04.830
of authority about Korean
cooking in America?

00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:06.370
And you're filling that void?

00:36:06.370 --> 00:36:10.415
MAANGCHI: I think that
first, food is delicious.

00:36:10.415 --> 00:36:11.630
Yeah.

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:14.330
Food is delicious.

00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:17.880
I didn't know about-- I
used to go backpack travel.

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:20.060
I have a lot of
hobbies, you know.

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:22.800
I traveled to many countries,
different countries.

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:26.840
But always I believed
that like food.

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:29.760
You've got Koreans,
especially Korean travelers.

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.690
You travel to
another country, you

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:34.040
got to taste that
other culture too.

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:37.200
And if they said, oh,
without Korean kimchi,

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.200
I cannot survive.

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:40.160
And then I kind of
criticized them.

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.740
Oh, my god, come on.

00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:43.270
Just two days, three days.

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:45.920
You know, I was
thinking like that.

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:50.340
But you know, later my readers,
those guys say the same thing.

00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:56.540
They said that Netherlands,
the guy named Rainier.

00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:58.860
He makes all kinds
of Korean dishes.

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:01.780
His cooking is better than
Korean housewives' cooking.

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:03.390
He's sending me photo.

00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:06.140
And he said he
traveled in Greece.

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:11.390
And then for one week he said,
oh, my god, I miss my kimchi.

00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:14.080
So I think there's kind
of [INAUDIBLE] you know.

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:18.450
So kimchis and also Korean
food is all vegetables.

00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:23.560
Like all kinds of vegetables,
mountain vegetables and tofu.

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.970
The way of cooking, not greasy.

00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:29.970
Some way like people really--
it must be appealing to people.

00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:31.500
So tasty.

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:33.420
And second, I think.

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:35.290
So Korean food, as you know.

00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:37.700
Korean barbecue, people
think about that.

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:39.810
You make a Korean
barbecue at home,

00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:42.800
you can share with
tons of people.

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:44.740
Reason three, I blog about this.

00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:48.400
One of my readers, he married.

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:52.425
On the wedding day reception,
he made Korean pork belly,

00:37:52.425 --> 00:37:53.420
Korean pork belly.

00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:58.550
He followed my recipe for the
pork belly and the grill plate

00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:59.970
and also the burner.

00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:03.990
Gas burner just only $20
in Korean grocery store.

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:07.720
And he prepared each
table, people are sitting,

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:09.990
10 people are sitting.

00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:12.080
And then he put this
in a grill plate.

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:12.875
Everything.

00:38:12.875 --> 00:38:15.210
Just let them cook themselves.

00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:16.440
And then pork belly.

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:17.500
And the lettuce.

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:20.110
Ssamjang, you had the
ssamjang today, dipping sauce.

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:22.290
And then everybody
just wrapped this,

00:38:22.290 --> 00:38:24.770
and they were so, so happy.

00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:26.470
And then my readers let me know.

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:28.950
So I was very impressed.

00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:32.590
So I just blogged
about his story.

00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:35.760
Korean food is that you can
share with many, many people.

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:37.510
It's supposed to be shared.

00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:39.940
And so I think maybe
that's the reason.

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:41.300
Where did you learn this recipe?

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:43.010
Oh, this is maangchi.com.

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:45.920
That's why I think people
come to my website.

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:47.760
And also it's the
Korean fried chicken.

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.840
Everybody loves
Korean fried chicken.

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:50.700
Because?

00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:51.589
Because why?

00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:52.630
AUDIENCE: It's delicious.

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:53.010
MAANGCHI: Hm?

00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:54.051
AUDIENCE: It's delicious.

00:38:54.051 --> 00:38:55.307
MAANGCHI: How?

00:38:55.307 --> 00:38:56.390
JAMES MULCAHY: Double fry.

00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:57.580
MAANGCHI: Yeah.

00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:00.660
This is exactly my editor
gave me a hard time.

00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:02.580
When I do this,
I'm like, oh, this

00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:04.330
is so delicious [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:06.630
She asked of me, how delicious?

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:08.320
You should explain.

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:10.400
Americans don't know
how delicious it is.

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.450
Oh.

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:13.950
Squeeze, squeeze, OK.

00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:17.720
It's like a chewy,
ooh, irresistible, oh.

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:19.210
Irresistible not enough.

00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:22.010
Say something.

00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:27.820
Korean fried chicken, as I know,
we always make the coating.

00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:32.980
The coating is made with starch,
like a potato starch I use.

00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:36.290
And then make it really
crunchy and a little sticky.

00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:41.170
So because of some juicy sauce
I mix in the last minute,

00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:44.420
and then make it kind of
a little sticky and taste

00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:45.860
like rice cake a little bit.

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:47.800
But very, very crunchy.

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.010
Crunch crunchy.

00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:52.800
So and also it depends on
how much you like spicy food.

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.870
You can add spiciness.

00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:58.240
Spicy, the chili pepper flakes.

00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:00.130
So I think that that's why.

00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:02.370
Crunchiness and delicious, yeah?

00:40:02.370 --> 00:40:03.180
Yeah.

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:04.370
That's why people love it.

00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:06.078
JAMES MULCAHY: I
recently read an article

00:40:06.078 --> 00:40:08.460
saying that Americanized
Korean cooking is too spicy.

00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:11.550
And actual Korean cooking is
not as spicy as we like it.

00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:12.360
Is that true?

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:13.120
MAANGCHI: No!

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:15.430
Where did you-- I see
there are whole tons

00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:20.050
of weird-- some theories of
from where are they coming?

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:23.500
You see the Koreans--
when I go to Korea,

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:25.680
I sometimes visit Korea.

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:27.800
Koreans love spicy food.

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:33.080
And we Koreans believe spicy
food makes your body really--

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:35.090
there is some
researchers and research.

00:40:35.090 --> 00:40:39.350
Spicy food that make you
always awake and then it's

00:40:39.350 --> 00:40:40.970
the entire Alzheimer.

00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:45.440
So you are always
make you smart.

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:48.390
So spicy food is very
good for your health.

00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:50.760
All the researchers
are working hard.

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:54.140
But real Koreans are
like early-morning TV.

00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:57.130
From early-morning TV
I have to see this.

00:40:57.130 --> 00:40:58.790
Koreans love food.

00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:02.740
All spicy sauce, mixed
with spicy sauce, eating.

00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:04.870
Even in America,
nobody-- even I don't

00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:07.370
feel like eating spicy
food from early morning.

00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:09.050
I skip breakfast.

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:13.560
I always drink large big
huge cups of black coffee.

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:15.610
That's my breakfast.

00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:16.890
My readers are surprised.

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:19.230
I thought that you loved
kimchi all the time.

00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:19.730
No way.

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:25.990
And then that's not true.

00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:27.722
So Korea is more spicy food.

00:41:27.722 --> 00:41:30.180
JAMES MULCAHY: I think it's
fun that you mentioned the "New

00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:31.350
York Times" article.

00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:35.160
And they kind of called you the
Julia Child of Korean cooking.

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:37.840
How do you feel about that?

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:40.470
MAANGCHI: That
terminology, Julia Child,

00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:44.730
that came from 2007.

00:41:44.730 --> 00:41:48.710
When I studied, just not long
after, I'm really soaring.

00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:50.330
My video was soaring.

00:41:50.330 --> 00:41:52.650
And then I was living in Canada.

00:41:52.650 --> 00:41:56.790
Canada, "New York Times"
version, Canadian newspaper.

00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:58.760
All nationwide, the
biggest newspaper,

00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:00.450
is the "Globe and Mail."

00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:02.600
So "Globe and Mail"
interviewed me.

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:04.130
And then she asked me.

00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:07.730
She wrote the Korea Julia Child.

00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:08.340
Right?

00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:11.140
So I didn't know who
the Julia Child is.

00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:12.170
Embarrassing, eh?

00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:13.410
I searched.

00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:17.370
Oh, Julia Child, French
cuisine to America.

00:42:17.370 --> 00:42:19.180
But anyway, ever
since that time,

00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:22.210
many people call me
Korean Julia Child.

00:42:22.210 --> 00:42:28.620
But one day, a Korean
newspaper guy read [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:33.650
I was interviewed after my
article in "Globe and Mail"

00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:39.697
was on, as usual, Korean
reporters came, bombarded me,

00:42:39.697 --> 00:42:40.530
can I interview you?

00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:41.820
Can I interview you?

00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:42.980
They don't find me.

00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:45.580
But always when I'm
in "New York Times,"

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:47.350
they just kept calling me.

00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:50.460
When I'm in YouTube and
did some cooking demo,

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:51.780
they just come to me.

00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:54.550
So when I'm on the
mainstream newspaper,

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:56.030
they want to interview me.

00:42:56.030 --> 00:43:00.460
So one day a Korean
interviewer asked me,

00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:04.000
how do you feel
about Julia Child?

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.190
And also somebody asked
me about Martha Stewart.

00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:16.050
Oh, YouTube subscriber numbers
are bigger than Martha Stewart.

00:43:16.050 --> 00:43:18.430
So they asked me
about Martha Stewart.

00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:21.350
So I said, Martha Stewart
doesn't have YouTube.

00:43:21.350 --> 00:43:22.790
That's why.

00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:26.010
You don't have to compare
me with Martha Stewart.

00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:29.620
Martha Stewart is such a
wonderful chef in the world,

00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:30.230
right?

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:32.160
So just-- I did it.

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:34.990
JAMES MULCAHY: Are you going to
have your own TV show one day?

00:43:34.990 --> 00:43:36.480
MAANGCHI: I'll just
think about it.

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:40.270
Already some TV show
people contacted me.

00:43:40.270 --> 00:43:43.180
But I was very busy
doing my cookbook.

00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:47.060
So I can't do this multiwork,
multitask like this.

00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:50.870
Because when I do this,
I have to focus on this.

00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:54.580
But I don't want to skip
my video every 10 day.

00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:57.940
This is-- my readers are
waiting, waiting, waiting.

00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:02.210
So I don't want to disappoint
my readers, YouTube audience.

00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:05.690
So when I have more time,
let me think about TV show.

00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:06.565
JAMES MULCAHY: Maybe.

00:44:06.565 --> 00:44:07.295
Maybe.

00:44:07.295 --> 00:44:09.420
I think it's a good time
to see if the audience has

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:10.150
any questions.

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:12.420
Does anyone?

00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:13.098
Here we go.

00:44:13.098 --> 00:44:14.930
AUDIENCE: Hi, Maangchi.

00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:17.835
For me, I think it's very clear
it's your personality that

00:44:17.835 --> 00:44:19.550
really makes you a
very interesting chef

00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:22.250
to watch on YouTube and
even listen to your talk.

00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:24.060
Can I get two questions?

00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:26.810
One is, what is your
favorite non-Korean food?

00:44:26.810 --> 00:44:28.250
And second, who made your logo?

00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:29.930
Because I think that's one of
the also really cute things

00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:31.410
that you have on your site.

00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:32.500
MAANGCHI: Yeah.

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:34.220
The logo?

00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:36.010
My daughter made.

00:44:36.010 --> 00:44:40.220
My daughter is--
she's a dentist.

00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:41.120
She made this.

00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:43.284
But I gave her idea.

00:44:43.284 --> 00:44:44.810
I gave her.

00:44:44.810 --> 00:44:47.710
Because I cannot draw well.

00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:50.880
But I know when she was young,
she could draw very well.

00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:54.780
So I said, OK, I want to
do this and kind of sign

00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:55.740
there like that.

00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:58.475
Some big fish and a big knife.

00:44:58.475 --> 00:44:59.600
And then I like to do that.

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:01.316
And then she made this.

00:45:01.316 --> 00:45:02.940
And also, what was
your first question?

00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:04.530
Oh, no Korean food.

00:45:04.530 --> 00:45:07.800
Oh, spaghetti.

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:09.930
Spaghetti and meatball.

00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:11.632
I love it.

00:45:11.632 --> 00:45:12.590
AUDIENCE: Hi, Maangchi.

00:45:12.590 --> 00:45:16.750
So I know that sometimes
you travel to new locations

00:45:16.750 --> 00:45:19.620
and use the local produce,
et cetera, to cook.

00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:23.000
I saw when you went to Maine,
or somewhere in New England.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.687
Do you have any
experience that you

00:45:24.687 --> 00:45:26.520
can relate where you
found something unusual

00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:29.220
and tried to use that
in Korean cooking?

00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:30.250
MAANGCHI: Yeah.

00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:32.830
He must have read my
website, you know?

00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:34.815
So like a very deep question.

00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:40.980
Before I started
my YouTube video,

00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:43.410
and when I traveled
in other country,

00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:45.700
for example, when
I went to France.

00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:48.900
I love-- crazy
about French cheese,

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:52.160
stinky cheese, from
Normandy, and baguette.

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:53.500
And I kept eating.

00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:55.750
And then I gained
weight when I came home.

00:45:55.750 --> 00:46:00.240
But I didn't mind, you know,
because delicious food.

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:06.070
But at the time, even though
I love, love their cuisine.

00:46:06.070 --> 00:46:09.580
But like around
three days after,

00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:12.560
I thought about something spicy.

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:13.290
Oh, my god.

00:46:13.290 --> 00:46:15.840
I cannot swallow very well.

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:18.330
I cannot swallow
French food well.

00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:20.050
Because I liked that.

00:46:20.050 --> 00:46:21.960
So I needed something spicy.

00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:25.620
So that I took some
Korean hot pepper paste.

00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:29.300
It looks like some
toothpaste, small paste.

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:32.130
And just in case I
might use this guy.

00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:33.400
And then I took it.

00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:36.520
And then, OK, time
for me to use this.

00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:38.200
I went out to grocery store.

00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:41.090
You can buy cucumber everywhere.

00:46:41.090 --> 00:46:44.920
I took it and washed this and
then just, [CRUNCH] one bite.

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:51.770
And then this, like, toothpaste,
like, pepper paste, one drop.

00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:54.510
And then, mm, it's
good, it's good.

00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:58.160
Now I calmed my stomach
and I can swallow well.

00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:01.550
I'm ready to eat
French cuisine again.

00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:05.490
And then ever since I
started my cooking video.

00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:07.350
And different case.

00:47:07.350 --> 00:47:09.040
I'm more serious at cooking.

00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:11.440
And also, whenever I
travel more than one

00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:13.560
week, I need to make a video.

00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:18.940
So with the local vegetable,
local some of the ingredients.

00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:24.720
So I have several ingredients,
like Korean soy sauce,

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:27.500
Korean hot pepper
paste, the bean paste.

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:29.600
And the fish sauce.

00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:32.760
Garlic, green onion, these
things you can get everywhere.

00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:35.150
So these things that
you cannot find easily.

00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:37.240
Plus, Korean rice.

00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:41.310
Korean rice is-- you may
know about Korean rice.

00:47:41.310 --> 00:47:44.830
Is same rice as sushi rice.

00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:49.500
Little stickier, stickier than
some Mexican or long-grain

00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:50.340
rice.

00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:54.310
Some people ask
me, oh, Maangchi.

00:47:54.310 --> 00:47:57.410
Is it working with normal rice?

00:47:57.410 --> 00:48:00.450
Normal rice for me is
short-grain rice, sushi rice.

00:48:00.450 --> 00:48:03.360
All my life I'm eating this.

00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:04.890
But I know what they mean.

00:48:04.890 --> 00:48:09.100
So I always take my rice also.

00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:11.530
And then I arrive there.

00:48:11.530 --> 00:48:12.780
I make a kimchi.

00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:18.190
And then I go to their local
grocery store and some market.

00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:21.410
And then I find that if I
don't find Napa cabbage,

00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:25.100
I just find any green,
any green, even spinach.

00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:27.005
I bring it and then
make just a kimchi.

00:48:27.005 --> 00:48:28.660
Or just the usual cabbage.

00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:31.540
Usual cabbage in kimchi,
also I posted the recipe.

00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:34.750
When I traveled, I was
in Mexico at the time.

00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:38.750
And then with cabbage, half
of cabbage I made the kimchi.

00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:40.910
Oh, was it delicious.

00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:43.290
I made a stew with this.

00:48:43.290 --> 00:48:46.880
So all the time I carry
Korean ingredients.

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:48.880
JAMES MULCAHY: Is there
anything that you really

00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:52.527
just hate to eat, that
you just don't like?

00:48:52.527 --> 00:48:53.610
MAANGCHI: Yeah, of course.

00:48:53.610 --> 00:48:56.560
I like [INAUDIBLE] one first.

00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:59.800
The first food I don't
like, like a bug.

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:00.990
I don't eat it.

00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:04.550
Some people just ask
me, can you cook dog?

00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:05.050
No.

00:49:08.810 --> 00:49:11.180
Yeah.

00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:13.175
Pretty much I love
all kinds of food.

00:49:13.175 --> 00:49:14.480
Yeah.

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:15.730
Oh!

00:49:15.730 --> 00:49:17.040
One recipe.

00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:20.100
My readers ask me, chicken feet.

00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:24.280
Maangchi, please make
the chicken feet recipe.

00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:26.920
But for some reason,
chicken feet,

00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:28.480
I don't think I can handle.

00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:30.900
You know, I can
handle live fish.

00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:33.600
I can handle live crab.

00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:36.170
And then also live lobster.

00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:39.820
All the recipes, videos
are on my channel.

00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:41.990
But for some reason
I don't think

00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:46.940
I can handle some chicken feet
and especially chicken toenail.

00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:49.890
And then I was thinking
about all these little things

00:49:49.890 --> 00:49:51.580
were just jumping around.

00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:52.600
How can I do this?

00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:53.972
Oh, I cannot.

00:49:53.972 --> 00:49:54.680
But I don't know.

00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:56.516
My readers, I love my readers.

00:49:56.516 --> 00:49:58.850
Maybe someday I
may change my mind.

00:49:58.850 --> 00:50:00.650
And also blood sausage.

00:50:00.650 --> 00:50:01.320
Blood sausage.

00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:04.140
People love the Korean
soondae, called soondae.

00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:06.070
But blood sausage, OK.

00:50:06.070 --> 00:50:07.730
I love to eat soondae.

00:50:07.730 --> 00:50:10.410
But one day I tried
to find blood,

00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:12.160
I need to buy blood, right?

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:14.530
So I went to Chinatown.

00:50:14.530 --> 00:50:15.910
I bought some blood.

00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:18.570
But oh, it turned out disaster.

00:50:18.570 --> 00:50:21.150
And also smell is not good.

00:50:21.150 --> 00:50:23.840
And then I hate that,
so I couldn't make it.

00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:25.850
But maybe I may
change my mind again.

00:50:25.850 --> 00:50:26.639
Who knows?

00:50:26.639 --> 00:50:28.430
JAMES MULCAHY: He had
a question over here.

00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:30.810
AUDIENCE: Yeah, you
talked about how

00:50:30.810 --> 00:50:33.666
you really, whenever
you eat something,

00:50:33.666 --> 00:50:36.970
you want to figure out
how to make it yourself.

00:50:36.970 --> 00:50:39.276
What's the hardest
thing that you've eaten

00:50:39.276 --> 00:50:42.520
that you try to replicate?

00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:43.670
MAANGCHI: Um.

00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:47.260
Something like when I go
to a fusion restaurant.

00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:50.180
Fusion restaurant is
really upscale restaurant.

00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:53.640
And then oh, this guy
made with kimchi brine.

00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:55.320
I can smell kimchi brine.

00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:59.630
And some sauce that is
like pinky, pinkish.

00:50:59.630 --> 00:51:01.870
And then maybe sour cream.

00:51:01.870 --> 00:51:03.880
But something that
I don't know about.

00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:06.640
I never went to culinary school.

00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:09.080
Only I know about Korean food.

00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:10.550
Sometimes I cannot figure out.

00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:13.080
And also I don't want to
know about that, right?

00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:15.450
But Korean food, though,
when it comes to Korean food,

00:51:15.450 --> 00:51:17.620
is almost all I know.

00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:19.640
When I taste this,
I know that how.

00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:23.980
Even people ask me, Maangchi,
I went to the restaurant,

00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:25.080
Korean restaurant.

00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:28.720
They gave me something like
sweet and really salty.

00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:30.430
And then kind of a
color that's brown.

00:51:30.430 --> 00:51:34.020
It tasted like a potato but
it's not exactly a potato.

00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:36.580
Oh, that's the fish cake.

00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:37.670
So I know that.

00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:40.120
So kind of things
that I know exactly

00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:43.090
about Korean dishes and
also Korean restaurants.

00:51:43.090 --> 00:51:45.520
North American Korean
restaurant, what they serve,

00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:46.270
usually.

00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:49.300
And then I know their
side dishes on their list.

00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:50.790
So easily I can figure out.

00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:54.420
But like a Korean fusion
restaurant, upscale restaurant.

00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:59.750
You know, those guys
learn culinary art.

00:51:59.750 --> 00:52:01.890
Some maybe like a
secret that they

00:52:01.890 --> 00:52:06.149
use, some spice that
I don't know, yeah.

00:52:06.149 --> 00:52:07.190
AUDIENCE: So I'm curious.

00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:09.846
Do you have many
followers in Korea?

00:52:09.846 --> 00:52:11.160
MAANGCHI: Yeah.

00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:13.910
These days a lot of
Koreans are coming.

00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:17.550
Actually, most of
the people coming

00:52:17.550 --> 00:52:20.750
are North America,
American, USA.

00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:25.850
USA is around 70% of
my readers are coming.

00:52:25.850 --> 00:52:28.490
How much, big, huge, huge fans.

00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:32.990
But Koreans are really
almost none until last year.

00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:37.830
But like over one year, these
days more and more people

00:52:37.830 --> 00:52:38.330
coming.

00:52:38.330 --> 00:52:41.370
And they leave Korean
comment in Korean.

00:52:41.370 --> 00:52:42.110
What should I do?

00:52:42.110 --> 00:52:43.980
I have to answer in Korean.

00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:46.410
And also I was thinking
that maybe these guys

00:52:46.410 --> 00:52:48.690
don't understand English.

00:52:48.690 --> 00:52:51.660
So I just studied
the Korean caption.

00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:54.230
So I did the English caption.

00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:57.310
I pay for English caption
because I cannot trust

00:52:57.310 --> 00:53:00.710
the Google translation.

00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:04.870
Not the Google-- the YouTube
translation, auto translation.

00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:10.470
So, but I hire translation.

00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:13.550
And also the Korean
translation is done by me.

00:53:13.550 --> 00:53:15.354
So I do this.

00:53:15.354 --> 00:53:17.770
JAMES MULCAHY: I think we have
time for one more question.

00:53:17.770 --> 00:53:18.690
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for being here.

00:53:18.690 --> 00:53:20.400
I actually go to your website.

00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:22.270
I'm Korean myself, but
I go to your website

00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:26.080
all the time to see
what else is out there.

00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:27.270
I have two questions.

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:32.360
One is, I was thinking about why
it took a while for Korean food

00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:34.390
to become so big in the States.

00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:37.230
And I feel like there's
this term called [? kom, ?]

00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:38.910
which you know.

00:53:38.910 --> 00:53:42.250
In Korean it means you just
do it by the feel of things.

00:53:42.250 --> 00:53:44.160
You don't really measure things.

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:45.880
You think that
that's the reason why

00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:49.929
it might have taken so long for
it to become big in the States?

00:53:49.929 --> 00:53:52.220
And then my second question
is, would you ever consider

00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:56.350
doing mokbang, which is
a big Korean-- you just

00:53:56.350 --> 00:53:57.180
eat on the show.

00:53:57.180 --> 00:53:59.430
And it's huge in
Korea right now.

00:53:59.430 --> 00:54:00.416
So I think, yeah.

00:54:00.416 --> 00:54:01.040
MAANGCHI: Yeah.

00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:05.640
This reminded me of another
reporter from Korea.

00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:10.350
KBS, the Korean
broadcasting-- the reporter

00:54:10.350 --> 00:54:14.680
asked me exactly the same
question about mokbang.

00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:16.700
Mokbang, I saw that one time.

00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:19.200
Kind of that's not my style.

00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:19.840
Yeah.

00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:22.190
I mean, I want to teach
Korean cooking, just

00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:23.440
authentic recipes.

00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:26.830
But always at the
end of my video,

00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:29.650
I show them how
passionately I eat.

00:54:29.650 --> 00:54:33.772
Sometimes people say, you
look like a crocodile.

00:54:33.772 --> 00:54:34.480
But I don't care.

00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:37.730
More people love that
when I enjoy my food.

00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:39.780
So because that's it.

00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:43.130
So who care if something
is between my teeth?

00:54:43.130 --> 00:54:46.650
So everybody, I mean, those
guys are following me.

00:54:46.650 --> 00:54:50.020
We are the same group
community, who love food.

00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:52.510
So and that I can answer.

00:54:52.510 --> 00:54:56.650
And Korean food, why, why
Korean food was not popular?

00:54:56.650 --> 00:54:58.880
I think Korean food is popular.

00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:00.300
We don't have to
worry about this.

00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:03.990
Because Japanese
food, it is popular.

00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:04.990
They're all new.

00:55:04.990 --> 00:55:08.350
Chinese food, Korean,
Japanese food.

00:55:08.350 --> 00:55:11.060
I mean, think
about Chinese food.

00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:12.710
China is a huge country.

00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:14.230
India, huge country.

00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:15.840
Mexico, huge country.

00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:18.050
They are not that huge big here.

00:55:18.050 --> 00:55:21.760
Nowadays I think that Japanese
food is very big these days.

00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:25.830
Food is delicious
and healthy, right?

00:55:25.830 --> 00:55:28.040
But Korean food is like a trend.

00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:31.510
But I'm surrounded by the
people who love Korean food.

00:55:34.370 --> 00:55:38.420
I think that everybody loves
Korean food, which is not true,

00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:39.450
which is not true.

00:55:39.450 --> 00:55:44.520
When I meet, sometimes I'm
interviewed by radio host,

00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:47.040
when I talk them,
I feel that, oh,

00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:48.470
they don't know
about Korean food.

00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:51.290
A lot of people don't
know about Korean kimchi.

00:55:51.290 --> 00:55:52.110
Not yet.

00:55:52.110 --> 00:55:54.180
So it's starting, starting.

00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:55.740
But I'm very positive.

00:55:55.740 --> 00:55:58.780
And because my readers
trust my recipe,

00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:01.450
they share the food
that they make.

00:56:01.450 --> 00:56:03.520
They share this with
their family and friends.

00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:06.270
And these days they
make lunch box.

00:56:06.270 --> 00:56:08.090
Call this in Japanese, bento.

00:56:08.090 --> 00:56:09.610
They call this bento.

00:56:09.610 --> 00:56:10.900
In Korean, dosirak.

00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:13.430
I used to make my
dosirak for my children.

00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:15.950
Sometimes I used to make a
lunch box plus a dinner box.

00:56:15.950 --> 00:56:18.630
And four, four lunch
box, dinner box.

00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:21.250
And I used to wake
at 5:00 AM to make

00:56:21.250 --> 00:56:25.290
the fresh meal for my family.

00:56:25.290 --> 00:56:29.570
So these days my
readers, Maangchi, I

00:56:29.570 --> 00:56:32.710
took dosirak, Korean
lunch box, to my work.

00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:35.250
All of my coworkers
were envious of me.

00:56:35.250 --> 00:56:38.739
So those guys are spreading
Korean food, I think, yeah.

00:56:38.739 --> 00:56:40.780
JAMES MULCAHY: And so are
you with your cookbook.

00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:41.690
That's our hour.

00:56:41.690 --> 00:56:43.540
There's cookbooks in
the back for sale.

00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:45.530
I think we all want to say
thank you so much for being here

00:56:45.530 --> 00:56:46.030
with us today.

00:56:46.030 --> 00:56:46.930
MAANGCHI: Thank you so much.

00:56:46.930 --> 00:56:47.430
Thank you.

00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:49.980
[APPLAUSE]
