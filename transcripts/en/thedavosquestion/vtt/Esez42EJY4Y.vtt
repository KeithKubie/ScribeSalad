00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.950
&gt;&gt;My name is Mike Useem.
I'm on the faculty at the University of Pennsylvania's

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.789
Wharton School,
the business school.

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:12.990
It's been my privilege to participate in the
annual meeting of the

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.450
World Economic Forum here in Davos this week.
And my observation about the state of the

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.480
world and where we're going
in the next 5 to 10 years is that as expressed

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.039
by many people here this
week, the opportunities are large for the

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.710
private sector and the public
sector to work actively together.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.171
It's many things of course, including the
willingness on the part of

00:00:36.171 --> 00:00:39.960
people in the private sector to take a stint
in government, to take a

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.600
public -- active public service role of that
kind.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.150
Or even if not that, for people in the private
sector to become

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.629
involved in public service.
Some of the companies who have been active

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.239
this week in Davos have also
on their own become active in the recovery

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.470
from the catastrophic
developments in Haiti as a form of public

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.739
service, obviously.
And the theme that strikes me is maybe one

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.610
of the most important issues
at this current World Economic Forum annual

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.740
event is that the potential
is enormous for the public sector and the

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.600
private sector to work
together to address the big problems that

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.600
we face: Education, health
catastrophes of one kind or another.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.450
I think just looking forward the next 5 to
10 years, we're going to see

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.259
more public/private partnership.
We are going to see more people moving from

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.010
the private sector into the
public sector.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.530
I think we're going to see more people in
the public sector an active

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.829
dialogue with people in private industry in
how to solve the problems

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.440
that we all face as a global community.
Thank you very much.
