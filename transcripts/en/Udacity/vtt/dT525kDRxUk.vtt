00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.670
Now let's draw this a little bit longer.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.200
Again I'm going to ask you 2 questions here.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.730
The first one is again that I would like to know from you

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.660
the length of a shortest path from A to B that visits all vertices.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.930
Please enter this here in this box.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:21.040
I would also like to know from you how many different shortest paths there are from A to B.

00:00:21.040 --> 99:59:59.000
I would like you to enter your number here in this box.
