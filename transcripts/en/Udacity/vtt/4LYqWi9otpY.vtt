00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.160
The area of this rectangle is the number of square units that occupies this

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.339
space. So we could find that by multiplying the length times the width, l times

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:15.056
w. For the perimeter, we're finding the distance around this rectangle, so

00:00:15.056 --> 00:00:19.464
we'll want to have 2w plus 2l, or I could write that in reverse order as 2l

00:00:19.464 --> 00:00:25.892
plus 2w. Either one would be correct. Nice work if you found these two

00:00:25.892 --> 00:00:26.890
expressions.
