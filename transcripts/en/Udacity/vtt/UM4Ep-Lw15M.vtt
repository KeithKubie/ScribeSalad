00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[D. Evans] So the answer is the first 3 are correct.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We want to get started programming, and we'll get started programming very soon.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The most important thing is to learn some computer science concepts,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and we'll do that as we get started programming, as well as along the way.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And the third goal is to write code to extract a link from a web page.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
That will be the first thing that we do to start building our search engine

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and collecting the corpus that we need for our search engine.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The fourth choice is not true.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We're not going to get to the point where we write code to rank web pages this unit.

00:00:29.000 --> 99:59:59.000
That's something that we'll be covering in Unit 6.
