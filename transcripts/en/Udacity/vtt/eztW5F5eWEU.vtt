00:00:00.578 --> 00:00:04.303
So one thing that many students in this
class are probably familiar with is

00:00:04.303 --> 00:00:07.442
Sebastian Thrun's Robotics
class on autonomous vehicles.

00:00:07.442 --> 00:00:11.358
David, where do you think an autonomous
vehicle would fall on the spectrum?

00:00:11.358 --> 00:00:14.177
&gt;&gt; So it seems to me like an autonomous
vehicle definitely moves around in

00:00:14.177 --> 00:00:15.960
the world so
it certainly acts in the world.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.228
And driving is a very
human-like behavior so

00:00:18.228 --> 00:00:19.967
I'd say that it acts like a human.

00:00:19.967 --> 00:00:20.888
&gt;&gt; What do you think?

00:00:20.888 --> 00:00:22.630
Do you agree with David?
