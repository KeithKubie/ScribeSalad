00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:02.120
Let's think about
the situation where

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.740
we have a completely
fair coin here.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:05.520
So let me draw it.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.190
I'll assume it's a
quarter or something.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.689
Let's see.

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:09.700
So this is a quarter.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.100
Let me draw my best attempt at
a profile of George Washington.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.270
Well, that'll do.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:16.339
So it's a fair coin.

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:18.130
And we're going to flip
it a bunch of times

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.130
and figure out the
different probabilities.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.880
So let's start with a
straightforward one.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.220
Let's just flip it once.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.160
So with one flip
of the coin, what's

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.150
the probability
of getting heads?

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.320
Well, there's two equally
likely possibilities.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.490
And the one with heads is one
of those two equally likely

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.960
possibilities, so
there's a 1/2 chance.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.550
Same thing if we
were to ask what

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.770
is the probability
of getting tails?

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.450
There are two equally likely
possibilities, and one of those

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.260
gives us tails, so 1/2.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.390
And this is one
thing to realize.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.250
If you take the
probabilities of heads

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.000
plus the probabilities
of tails, you

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.900
get 1/2 plus 1/2, which is 1.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.430
And this is generally true.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.890
The sum of the probabilities
of all of the possible events

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.240
should be equal to 1.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.710
And that makes sense,
because you're adding up

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.492
all of these fractions,
and the numerator

00:01:08.492 --> 00:01:10.450
will then add up to all
of the possible events.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.780
The denominator is always
all the possible events.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.960
So you have all
the possible events

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.334
over all the
possible events when

00:01:15.334 --> 00:01:17.220
you add all of these things up.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.070
Now let's take it up a notch.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.477
Let's figure out the
probability of-- I'm

00:01:21.477 --> 00:01:23.060
going to take this
coin, and I'm going

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.270
to flip it twice--
the probability

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.320
of getting heads and then
getting another heads.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.780
There's two ways
to think about it.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.410
One way is to just
think about all

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:37.860
of the different possibilities.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.860
I could get a head on
the first flip and a head

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.110
on the second flip,
head on the first flip,

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.690
tail on the second flip.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.130
I could get tails on the first
flip, heads on the second flip.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.630
Or I could get
tails on both flips.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.000
So there's four distinct,
equally likely possibilities.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.990
And one way to think about
is on the first flip,

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.530
I have two possibilities.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.750
On the second flip, I have
another two possibilities.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.900
I could have heads or
tails, heads or tails.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.639
And so I have four
possibilities.

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:08.930
For each of these possibilities,
for each of these two,

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.699
I have two possibilities here.

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:14.550
So either way, I have four
equally likely possibilities.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.300
And how many of those
meet our constraints?

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.120
Well, we have it
right over here,

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.620
this one right
over here-- having

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.450
two heads meets our constraints.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.960
And there's only one
of those possibilities.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.220
I've only circled one
of the four scenarios.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.900
So there's a 1/4 chance
of that happening.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.260
Another way you could
think about this-- and this

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.900
is because these are
independent events.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.850
And this is a very
important idea

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.260
to understand in
probability, and we'll also

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.620
study scenarios that
are not independent.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.570
But these are
independent events.

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.870
What happens in the
first flip in no way

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.717
affects what happens
in the second flip.

00:02:50.717 --> 00:02:53.300
And this is actually one thing
that many people don't realize.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.030
There's something called
the gambler's fallacy, where

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.650
someone thinks if I
got a bunch of heads

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.020
in a row, then all
of a sudden, it

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.186
becomes more likely on the
next flip to get a tails.

00:03:00.186 --> 00:03:01.210
That is not the case.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.530
Every flip is an
independent event.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.600
What happened in the
past in these flips

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.870
does not affect the
probabilities going forward.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.640
The fact you got a heads
on the first flip in no way

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.060
affects that you got a
heads on the second flip.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.830
So if you can make
that assumption,

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.705
you could say that the
probability of getting

00:03:20.705 --> 00:03:23.180
heads and heads, or
heads and then heads,

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.590
is going to be the same thing
as the probability of getting

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.860
heads on the first flip
times the probability

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.197
of getting heads
on the second flip.

00:03:34.197 --> 00:03:36.780
And we know the probability of
getting heads on the first flip

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.280
is 1/2 and the probability
of getting heads

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.170
on the second flip is 1/2.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.240
And so we have 1/2
times 1/2, which

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.560
is equal to 1/4, which is
exactly what we got when

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.610
we tried out all of the
different scenarios, all

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.230
of the equally
likely possibilities.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.200
Let's take it up another notch.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.600
Let's figure out
the probability--

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.400
and we've kind of
been ignoring tails,

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.570
so let's pay some
attention to tails.

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.110
The probability of
getting tails and then

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.960
heads and then tails-- so
this exact series of events.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.080
So I'm not saying in any
order two tails and a head.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.990
I'm saying this exact order--
the first flip is a tails,

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.690
second flip is a heads, and
then third flip is a tail.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.510
So once again, these are
all independent events.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.854
The fact that I got tails
on the first flip in no way

00:04:22.854 --> 00:04:24.270
affects the
probability of getting

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.475
a heads on the second flip.

00:04:25.475 --> 00:04:27.225
And that in no way
affects the probability

00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:29.364
of getting a tails
on the third flip.

00:04:29.364 --> 00:04:31.030
So because these are
independent events,

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.238
we could say that's the same
thing as the probability

00:04:33.238 --> 00:04:35.950
of getting tails on
the first flip times

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.460
the probability of getting
heads on the second flip times

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.530
the probability of getting
tails on the third flip.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.040
And we know these are
all independent events,

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:52.300
so this right over here is
1/2 times 1/2 times 1/2.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.390
1/2 times 1/2 is 1/4.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:05:00.100
1/4 times 1/2 is equal to
1/8, so this is equal to 1/8.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.080
And we can verify it.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.690
Let's try out all of the
different scenarios again.

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.930
So you could get
heads, heads, heads.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.650
You could get
heads, heads, tails.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.700
You could get
heads, tails, heads.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.385
You could get
heads, tails, tails.

00:05:17.385 --> 00:05:21.574
You can get tails, heads, heads.

00:05:21.574 --> 00:05:22.990
This is a little
tricky sometimes.

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.865
You want to make sure
you're being exhaustive

00:05:24.865 --> 00:05:27.580
in all of the different
possibilities here.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:33.260
You could get
tails, heads, tails.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.690
You could get
tails, tails, heads.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.570
Or you could get
tails, tails, tails.

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.120
And what we see here is
that we got exactly eight

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.320
equally likely possibilities.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.050
We have eight equally
likely possibilities.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.260
And the tail, heads, tails
is exactly one of them.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.870
It is this possibility
right over here.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:59.060
So it is 1 of 8 equally
likely possibilities.
