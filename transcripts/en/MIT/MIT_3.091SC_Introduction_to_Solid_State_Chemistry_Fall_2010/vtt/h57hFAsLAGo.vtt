00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.880
Tuesday will be the
first weekly quiz,

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.170
celebration that is.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.790
That will be at the beginning
of recitation.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.620
You'll have 10 minutes.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.270
It'll be a short one-pager.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.170
You just write on the page.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.560
All you bring is your periodic
table, which you should have

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.250
gotten in recitation
yesterday.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.190
Periodic Table, table of
constants, calculator,

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.000
something to write with, but no
aid sheet on the weeklies.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.910
Readings: Readings,
I urge you to read

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.720
before you come to class.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.680
And so if you go to the
website, you can go to

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.560
Schedule, and in the schedule,
you'll see stuff like this

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.860
that tells you what the readings
are for the day.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.640
As I mentioned last day,
the lectures are being

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.990
videographed and posted probably
within an hour on the

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.630
website and any of the images
that I show are also recorded,

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.150
burned as PDFs and uploaded.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.640
So you don't have to be put in
high-speed stenographic mode

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.160
in order to attend class.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.260
What's the other thing
I wanted to tell you?

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.340
If you're new to the class or
if you need to change your

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.820
recitation section because your
conditions have changed,

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.780
do not simply go to
the other class.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.350
We're trying to regulate
enrollment,

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.680
particularly on Tuesdays.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.740
If the TA shows up expecting 20
students and has 20 copies

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.950
of the quiz and 25 people
show up, that's not

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.240
a recipe for success.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.510
So you must go to my
administrative assistant,

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.300
Hilary Sheldon in order
to change recitation.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.830
And if you need any of the
handouts and so on, it's just

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.740
down the hall here in Building
8, Room 201.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.720
I think that's all that
I had to say.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.160
If you go here the videos
are all listed.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.040
So last day we started talking
about taxonomy and that led us

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.270
to the beginnings of
atomic theory.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.790
We visited with Democritus,
400 BC.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.790
We had that detour with the
idiocy of Aristotle, and then

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.510
eventually got back to our
senses, and we saw John Dalton

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.540
with his table of the elements,
and then ultimately

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.260
onto Mendeleyev.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.240
And I wanted to pick up
the thread there.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.390
But before doing so, draw
attention the fact that John

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.900
Dalton did more than simply
develop a set of fonts for us.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.090
So he proposed the model of the
atom and this goes back

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.440
little over 200 years ago,
and these are the

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.120
features of the model.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.680
First of all, that matter is
composed of atoms that are

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.360
indivisible and indestructible.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.560
So that goes all
the way back to

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.780
Democritus, nothing new there.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.685
All atoms of an element
are identical.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.330
Atoms of different elements
have different weights and

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.550
different chemical properties.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.170
This is the emergence of modern
material science, the

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.410
connection between properties
and elements.

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.900
So the weight arguably is one
of the properties, but the

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.910
only way they could distinguish
elements at that

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.890
time was by their atomic mass.

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.110
Atoms of different elements
combine in simple whole-number

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.600
ratios to form compounds.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.120
Well, that makes sense because
they're the elements.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.750
They are the elemental
building blocks.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.690
If I told you you could build a
structure made of blocks and

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.720
part-way through your
construction I say, why don't

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.210
you cut that block in half,
you'd say, well, then the

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.510
block isn't the building
block.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.730
It's the half-block that's
the building block.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.650
So axiomatically if these are
the elements they must combine

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.650
in simple whole-number ratios
to form compounds.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.600
And lastly, atoms cannot be
created or destroyed.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.180
Well, he wasn't foretelling
E equals mc squared.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.700
What he was saying was that if
you take elements and you

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.620
combine them to form a compound,
if you subsequently

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.510
decompose the compound
you get the elements

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.690
back as they were.

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:16.250
So those are the features
of John Dalton's model.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.780
And we fast forward to 1869.

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.520
And this is the knowledge that
was available at the time in

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.380
terms of the elements that
had been isolated and

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.500
characterized.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.220
And it was with this
set of elements

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.410
that Mendeleyev operated.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.250
On file cards, in his breast
pocket, he carried with him

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.150
everywhere.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.760
And he wrote down the names of
the elements and their atomic

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.620
masses and their properties and
whatever else he could use

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.510
the way of characterizing
them.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.620
And during the course of
writing a textbook--

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.250
he had just finished a chapter
on the alkaline metals and he

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.220
was sitting in the railway
station playing

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.780
solitaire, and boom!

00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:00.110
The flash came to him that you
don't put arsenic underneath

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.590
aluminum even though it's next
in mass to zinc. You move it

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.470
over and you don't even
put it under silicon.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.840
You put it under phosphorus.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.680
And furthermore, what he said
was there's going to be an

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.780
element here discovered under
silicon and it will have these

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:14.410
properties.

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.290
And let's look a little bit more
deeply at the properties.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:23.870
But before doing so I want to
say that by announcing this

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.580
prediction of what the element
should be that's missing is

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.010
that we start to see the
evolution of principles of

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.930
modern chemistry.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.320
First of all, he recognized
the pattern.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.060
So did Lothar Meyer
in Tuebingen.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.090
So they both proposed a
periodic table of the

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.320
elements, but where Mendeleyev
pulled away from the pack and

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.250
distinguished himself was
that he developed a

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.880
quantitative model.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.000
And I haven't shown you the
quantitative aspect yet.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.530
That's coming next.

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.020
That explains the observations,
and that's good.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.420
You might say, well,
that's just curve

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.880
fitting if you're a cynic.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.440
But it makes predictions that
can be tested by experiment,

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.360
tested by experiment.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.430
So let's take a look.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.950
He said that under silicon, but
above tin, there would be

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:07.420
an element.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:08.680
He called it eka-silicon.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.570
Eka is a Sanskrit word,
which means one after.

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.090
So this is the element
one after silicon.

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.610
It was eventually isolated and
given the name germanium.

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.770
Mendeleyev said it would
have an atomic mass of

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.200
72 grams per mole.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.640
In fact, it's 72.59.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.510
He said it would have a density
of 5.5 grams per cubic

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:29.060
centimeter.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.870
It's 5.36.

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.462
This is 1869.

00:06:33.462 --> 00:06:35.940
He said that it would have a
high melting point, whatever

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.520
that means, and it melts
at 958 Celsius.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.430
It's compounds.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.750
he said it would form a dioxide
with a high melting

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:45.660
point and a density of 4.7.

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:49.590
It forms a dioxide and
its density is 4.70.

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:53.430
In fact, there's a story about a
French mineralogist who came

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:57.050
upon some of the stuff that
ultimately became germanium

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.200
dioxide, measured its density
and reported it to Mendeleyev

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.750
in a letter, saying, you know I
measured the stuff and it's

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.880
5.3 grams per cubic
centimeter.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.960
Mendeleyev wrote him back
and he said, make

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:08.780
the measurement again.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:09.630
You're wrong.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:11.770
He wrote back three months
later and said,

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:12.870
I measured it again.

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.620
It's 4.7.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.055
That was the genius
of Mendeleyev.

00:07:17.055 --> 00:07:20.330
To go way out on a limb and
make those predictions.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.960
And so I've made the case for
the table of the elements.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.910
Why do we call it the
Periodic Table?

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:27.310
What's the periodic about?

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:28.490
Well, the periodic--

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.430
take a look here, if you go to
the website there's a tab

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:35.040
called Courseware and there's
a tab called Periodic Table.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:39.450
And you can go to the Periodic
Table and ask the software to

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:40.810
plot property.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:44.470
So for example this is boiling
point versus proton number or

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:45.690
atomic number.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:48.630
And so you see the boiling point
varies as you move from

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:50.630
low atomic number to
high atomic number.

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:52.110
But it's not totally random.

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.290
It's not a Gaussian
distribution.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:55.280
There are features.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.410
It goes up and down, up,
down, up and down.

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:01.180
If you train your eye a little
bit you'll actually see some

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.350
regularity, a pattern there.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:04.380
Maybe that's not so good.

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:05.100
Let's look at this one.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.620
This is electrical
conductivity.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:10.680
And again, up, down, up, down
and look at those red lines.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.880
There, there, there, there.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:12.760
Don't you see something?

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.020
That's a pattern.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.690
And they're almost
equally spaced.

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:20.720
So that was where Mendeleyev
announced his Periodic Law,

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.520
where he said the properties are
related to the identity of

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:29.930
the atoms. And furthermore, he
announced, that the properties

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:33.870
are a periodic variation
in atomic mass.

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:44.320
So let's get that now
Mendeleyev's Periodic Law, and

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:57.220
the properties of the
elements vary

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:04.960
periodically with atomic mass.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.290
That was Mendeleyev.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:17.010
So now that we know that we can
go forward, and here's now

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:21.010
the full-blown Periodic Table
according to the framework

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:22.250
that Mendeleyev established.

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:24.520
Now if you look at this
carefully, you'll see down

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.600
here things get whited out
and there's these strange

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.000
notations, uu, m, and
all that stuff.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:30.730
What's that all about?

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:32.210
This is where the super
heavies lie.

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:34.190
These are all synthetic
elements.

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:39.820
Transuranic, they're made by
high-energy reactions,

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:44.250
so-called high-energy physics
in what you might call

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:48.020
accelerators, atom smashers,
what have you.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.360
And there's only three places
on the planet where you can

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.340
conduct such reactions.

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:59.510
One of them is in Darmstadt
in Germany.

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:02.860
One is in Dubna, just
outside of Moscow.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:04.860
And if you want to stay home--

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:07.390
and eschew the frequent flyer
miles-- you can go to

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:08.550
Berkeley, California.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.690
These are the three places where
we have the accelerators

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:17.110
capable of making
such compounds.

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:22.210
And so, take a look carefully
at what the nomenclature is.

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:26.690
The way you name them is by
using these Latin ordinals.

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:29.420
So un, bi, tri, quad
and so on.

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:33.760
So if you wanted to name element
115, it's ununpentium.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.880
You want the ium ending.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:37.900
And you can make these up.

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.730
You could make up element 205
if you want to or whatever.

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:44.540
My favorite is 111 because
that's unununium.

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:49.760
But there they are, so you
can have fun with those.

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:55.870
But with time, the elements are
being named and these have

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:58.420
been synthesized since
your version of

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.080
the table was printed.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:05.080
And so number 110 is named
Darmstadtium in honor of the

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.820
team at Darmstadt that
first isolated it.

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:13.570
And number 111 was just named
two years ago and the name is

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:15.250
roentgenium after Wilhelm
Roentgen,

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:18.500
who discovered x-rays.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:19.940
Now what is it about
discovery?

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:26.060
Well, here's an example of one
such reaction that would give

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.650
you an element.

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:31.550
So if we had access to one of
these devices we could take,

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:35.790
for example, lead and nickel and
accelerate them to very,

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:39.740
very high energies.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:42.790
And then we could make
110, ununilium.

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:49.010
Or now we'll call it
Darmstadtium plus neutron.

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:54.170
And in doing so we've generated
the new element.

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:58.650
But we can't just say we've made
the element and publish.

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:01.470
We have to be able to
characterize it.

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:05.910
Remember the reason that we gave
Cavendish the credit for

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:08.590
discovering hydrogen wasn't that
he's the first to know

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:11.970
that hydrogen exists, but he
isolated it and gave it value.

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:14.120
So if you look at the rest of
the periodic table, you get

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.630
things like boiling point,
melting point, density,

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:20.070
electronegativity, first
ionization energy.

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:21.650
There's a lot of information
there.

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:23.000
If you go down here
there's nothing.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.390
It's all blanks.

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:27.810
These things have very,
very short lifetimes.

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:29.230
Fractions of a second.

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:30.530
But you have to isolate them.

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:32.930
There's certain criteria
before you can publish.

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:35.820
And all this is regulated by
this governing body called the

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:38.930
International Union of Pure
and Applied Chemistry, So

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:44.530
UPAC, the organization that
finally rules on the

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:46.240
legitimacy of any of these.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.450
And actually there have been
some retractions in recent

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:50.790
years, where people published
claiming--

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:53.870
I think there was a report out
of Berkeley claiming that

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:57.170
they'd synthesized 115 and then
subsequently that was

00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:01.060
retracted because they couldn't
support the property

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:02.870
measurements

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:06.570
Last thing is, if you're
interested, want to do some

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:09.150
extra reading, there's a
fantastic book about

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:09.690
Mendeleyev.

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:13.630
He was the youngest of 14
children, came out of a very

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:18.380
poor family in Siberia and rose
to be a giant of his day.

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.490
He was a polymath.

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:23.910
He, among some of the other
things he did, he worked for

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:28.485
the Ministry of Weights and
Measures under the czar.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:35.270
The czar was interested in
taxation of alcohol.

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:41.150
And if you mix equal volumes of
water and vodka you don't

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:42.420
get additivity.

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:46.460
So 100 mL of water plus 100 mL
of vodka doesn't give 200 mL.

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:47.680
It gives less.

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:52.000
And so Mendeleyev did a study to
determine what the optimum

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.280
ratio is so that people couldn't
misrepresent the

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:58.340
amount of alcohol
in the beverage.

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:01.820
And set the standard at 40%
alcohol by volume, which is

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.700
used the world over
to this day.

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:08.170
He also came to the United
States in 1876 to go to

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:10.060
Titusville, Pennsylvania,
where the first

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:11.550
oil well was drilled.

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:15.790
And did an exhaustive study
of what was the American

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:17.140
petroleum industry
at the time.

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.880
And then went back to Imperial
Russia and did the same survey

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.660
for the Czar in Imperial Russia,
including a report

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:26.370
that recommended how to develop
the natural resources

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:27.890
of the time.

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:29.035
He was really an amazing man.

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:31.100
He wrote text books and so on.

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:34.730
And nobody in science--

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:36.890
I would venture to say--
has not heard of

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:38.270
the periodic table.

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:40.010
Mendeleyev died in 1906.

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:42.760
The Nobel Prizes were first
offered in 1901.

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:48.560
So there were five years where
he was close to the top for

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:52.110
winning the Noble Prize but was
eked out by somebody else.

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:53.630
When you look back at
those other Nobel

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:55.450
Prizes, they were deserved.

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:59.170
But none more so than
that for Mendeleyev.

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:04.420
So ironically the man who gave
us seminal knowledge of all

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:07.780
chemistry was never awarded
the Nobel Prize.

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:11.000
And there's probably a lot
of politics in there.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.120
And as I said last day, here's
the typical picture of him.

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:16.280
In this he sort of looks
like a street person,

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.590
disheveled and so on.

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:21.780
But this was the man that gave
us the periodic table.

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:26.580
That's him at age 35 when he
annunciated the Periodic Law.

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:28.680
So good for him.

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:29.160
Alright.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:34.720
So now, let's take a look a
little deeper about the

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.070
properties of the elements.

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:38.070
How do we understand the
properties of the elements?

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:39.820
For the properties elements
we're going to have to look

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:41.380
inside the atom.

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:43.120
If you did your reading
you undoubtedly

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.790
came across this table.

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:48.000
Which at first pass,
deconstructs the atom into

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.100
three simple particles:
the electron, the

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:51.690
proton and the neutron.

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:54.220
Here are their symbols,
e, p and n.

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:58.080
And they're distinguished
by charge and mass.

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:02.030
So the electron has charge,
minus 1.6 times 10 to the

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:04.130
minus 19 Coulombs.

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:07.940
And a very low mass: 9.11
times 10 to the minus 31

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:11.360
kilograms. The electronic charge
is balanced by the

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.590
protonic charge.

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:14.260
The atom is net neutral.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:18.060
So the proton has a charge of
plus 1.6 times 10 to the minus

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:19.540
19 Coulombs.

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:22.920
The neutron, as the name
implies, has 0 charge.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.350
The proton and the neutron
have very nearly

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:27.170
equal masses, however.

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:27.530
Right.

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:30.390
And just a word about
the units.

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:35.440
The units here are given
in terms of the Systeme

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.640
Internationale.

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:40.140
So when we use the term, C,
capital C is for the Coulomb.

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:45.240
And that's the unit of charge.

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.810
And it has an uppercase letter
because it's named after a

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:52.260
scientist. In this case, the
French scientist, Coulomb,

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.120
whereas the gram is
not named after a

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:57.790
scientist and so it's lowercase.

00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:00.210
And then we can amplify
by powers of three.

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:03.620
So if I want 1,000 of these,
I put a lowercase k here.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:07.150
If I put an uppercase K, I end
up with the unit Kelvin, which

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:10.180
is the unit of temperature
named after Lord Kelvin.

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:14.880
And all of this is known as
SI units, which is the

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.100
International System.

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:19.510
And it's not because the
scientists don't know how to

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:20.970
develop an abbreviation.

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:23.720
This was originally developed
when French was the

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.180
international language
of science.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:31.000
So this is known as the Systeme
Internationale and all

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.970
of these units were defined
at that time.

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:40.760
And the term SI sticks
that's the legacy.

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:43.810
All right, so now if we go
to the Periodic Table.

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:48.400
When we start looking at the
elements, we can look at any

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.340
entry on the Periodic Table,
and we have the chemical

00:17:51.340 --> 00:18:00.260
symbol that I'm designating here
as uppercase X, and this

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.620
was originally John Dalton
with the I and the

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:03.890
circle around it.

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:09.520
And about 30 years later the
Swedish scientist Berzelius

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:13.030
suggested that we use neutral
units and so therefore we have

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:16.920
the Latin coming in for many of
the elements, such as iron,

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.970
Fe, ferrum, and gold
Au, aurum.

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:23.430
In the upper-left corner,
we have the quality I'm

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:29.780
representing here, A And
A is the mass number.

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:31.960
Some people call it
the atomic weight.

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:34.470
And it is the sum of the
masses of all the

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:35.350
constituents.

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:39.210
So it's the sum of the mass of
the protons, so it's the

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:43.360
proton number plus the
neutron number plus

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.390
the electron number.

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:48.330
But since the electron weighs
1/1800 of what these others

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.450
weigh, you normally don't
consider this.

00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:51.240
It doesn't matter.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:55.870
So just adding protons plus
neutrons gets you to what we

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:57.290
call the atomic weight.

00:18:57.290 --> 00:19:02.420
And then down in the lower left
corner we have Z and Z is

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:03.850
the proton number.

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:13.250
And as the name implies, it's
equal to the number of protons

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:20.200
in the nucleus, which then
equals the number of electrons

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.430
outside the nucleus in
the neutral atom.

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:30.360
Now I'm specifying neutral
atom, because it's not

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:32.820
necessary for atoms to be
neutral and we'll take a look

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:36.040
at those in a moment.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.690
A point about redundancy here.

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:40.930
We don't really need the proton
number and the chemical

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:44.840
symbol because the proton
number really defines.

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:47.110
The proton number is like the
Social Security number.

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:53.820
This is the identity
number of the atom.

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:55.180
If we change the the
proton number,

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:58.200
we change its identity.

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.360
So for example, I could
write sodium.

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:04.940
Sodium 23 and 11.

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:06.220
I don't need the 11.

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:09.410
11 means it's sodium or
sodium means it's 11.

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:13.080
So I could just write
this as 23 sodium.

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.860
So I know it's sodium, that
means it's got 11 protons and

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:18.220
23 minus 11 must be neutrons.

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:20.050
Or if I wanted to be a
smart aleck, I could

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:22.030
write this : 23 11.

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:22.880
That's sodium.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.640
I don't need to put
anything here.

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:29.850
But there's no smart alecks
here, of course.

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:34.980
So for example, we could then
show this reaction as--

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:36.010
this is what?

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:37.520
208.

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:39.720
This is lead, 208.

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:49.050
And nickel, 62 gives us
Darmstadtium with a value of

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:51.900
269 and the neutron is 1.

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:56.450
You can see how these reactions
can be made to go.

00:20:56.450 --> 00:21:01.130
Now atoms don't necessarily
have to be net neutral.

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:07.950
We can have something that
is net non-zero charge.

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:14.270
Net non-zero charge on the atom
gives it the term, ion.

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:17.740
Ion is an atom with net
non-zero charge.

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:22.810
And we have two cases where
the atom is net positive.

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:26.110
If the atom is net positive
that's the result of electron

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:27.780
deficiency.

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:29.420
The atom is electron
deficient.

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:35.510
And we term such an
atom the cation.

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:36.750
There's two types of ions.

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:38.100
The cation.

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:41.740
And then we have something
that is net negative.

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:44.280
If it's net negative, it means
it's electron-rich.

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:48.660
That is to say, there are more
electrons than protons and the

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:52.370
net negative ion is
called the anion.

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:53.910
And you can try to
figure out ways.

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:57.120
I sometimes think that cation
has a t, which looks a little

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.420
bit like a plus sign.

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:03.960
Anion has five letters, minus
has five letters.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.980
And they both end in n, but
this has an n, which is

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:07.700
negative or something.

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:08.950
You'll figure something out.

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:16.420
Now we've talked about
varying charge at

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:19.300
constant proton number.

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:21.750
But the other thing we can
do is we can look at--

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:27.640
you can vary the
neutron number.

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:30.050
Since the neutron has no
charge you can vary the

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:32.350
neutron number and not harm the
identity and still have a

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:32.980
neutral atom.

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:41.690
So vary neutron number at
constant proton number.

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:45.030
And let's see what that is.

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:48.220
That gives you something
that looks like this.

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:52.480
So for example, if you if you
look at carbon, the atomic

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:56.100
mass that's shown
here is 12.011.

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:58.550
And you'd say, well, gee, if
it's got 6 neutrons and 6

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:01.130
protons, why isn't
that 12 exactly?

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:03.640
Well, this is the answer here.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:05.840
You can vary the neutron
number at

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.160
constant proton number.

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:11.101
So let's take a look at
how that plays out.

00:23:11.101 --> 00:23:14.660
The way that plays out
is as following.

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:16.930
Let's see I'm going to make
a little table here.

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:29.130
So we'll start with carbon 12.

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:31.290
Carbon 12, so that means--

00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:32.035
now I know what I'm
going to do.

00:23:32.035 --> 00:23:37.820
I'm going to bring this down and
make some headings for me.

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:40.230
This will be my proton
number and this will

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:43.230
be my neutron number.

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:45.180
And finally I'm going
to talk about

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:46.990
abundance, natural abundance.

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:54.260
So carbon 12, since it's carbon,
axiomatically it must

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:55.850
have 6 protons.

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:59.170
And 12 minus 6 is 6, so
it's got 6 neutrons.

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:02.260
And this is the dominant
form of carbon.

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:05.370
If you took a chemical analysis
of the carbon you'd

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:12.660
find that over 98%, 98.892% of
the carbon atoms that you

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:18.820
examined would be of this
form, carbon 12.

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:22.980
Now there's also carbon 13.

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:25.660
Has to be 6, otherwise
it's not carbon.

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.690
That means it's got
7 neutrons.

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:29.110
And it's a minority species.

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:31.530
1.108%.

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:34.490
And then there's a third
form of carbon and

00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:36.310
that's carbon 14.

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:40.870
Again, has to be 6 and
it's got 8 neutrons.

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:44.480
And it's found in vanishingly
small quantities, one part in

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:45.900
10 to the 12.

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:50.710
Or we could call it ppt,
parts per trillion.

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:58.010
So this is same atomic number,
same proton number, same Z but

00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:03.770
different mass numbers.

00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:04.960
Different A's.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:09.290
So all of these variants of
carbon are found on the same

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:12.120
place, the same spot on
the Periodic Table.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:15.290
The Greek word for same is iso,
and the word for place is

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:18.370
topo, so these are
called isotopes.

00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:22.970
The isotopes of carbon are
species that have identical

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:26.840
proton number but different
neutron number.

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:28.370
How about the units?

00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:29.650
What are the units here?

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:32.620
Well, we have to give
some kind of unit.

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:36.790
I've been sort of freely going
around and counting protons as

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:37.740
one and so on.

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:39.440
And here's the standard.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:48.330
The standard for mass is
defined, and the definition

00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:49.720
goes like this.

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:53.220
If you take carbon 12, which we
just introduced to you, and

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:58.580
we say that we're going to
specify a mass of 12.000 grams

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:05.400
exactly for a specified
quantity, in other words, a

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:08.850
specified number of these atoms.
We have to say we'll

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:13.550
take a certain number of these
carbon atoms and specify the

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:16.350
mass of that number
is 12 exactly.

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:23.680
And specified number of
atoms being the mole.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.180
The mole.

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:29.880
And it turns out that the mole
has a value of 6.02 times 10

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:30.900
to the 23rd.

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:33.210
How do they get that number?

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:37.300
A little bit more in the
way of definitions.

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:39.590
It was a concept put forth
by a professor.

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:41.660
So we're going to take some time
on it because we respect

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:45.870
professors, in this class at
least. And so this was a

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:51.400
concept put forth by Professor
Amadeo Avogadro.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:55.580
Professor Avogadro, who was a
professor of physics at the

00:26:55.580 --> 00:27:00.790
University of Turin, Torino.

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:02.651
And he was a contemporary of
John Dalton's and they were

00:27:02.651 --> 00:27:04.510
both studying gases.

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:08.560
And it was Avogadro who taught
us that, when you keep the

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:11.860
pressure constant equal volumes
of different gases

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:14.250
contain equal numbers
of molecules.

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:17.980
It doesn't matter if you have
argon, which is by itself

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:21.180
atomic, or we have oxygen, which
is diatomic, or you have

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:25.360
methane, which is CH4, five
atoms making a compound.

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:27.740
Equal pressure, equal
volume, equal

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:29.270
numbers of those species.

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:31.720
So that was Avogadro's Law.

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.010
So let's put that down.

00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:46.160
At constant pressure equal
volumes of different gases,

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:51.340
contain identical numbers of
atoms. Equal volumes of

00:27:51.340 --> 00:28:03.010
different gases contain equal
numbers of molecules.

00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:06.280
And here I'm using the term
molecule as a counting unit.

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:08.690
So it could be, strictly
speaking, an atom or it could

00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:10.800
be diatomic and so on.

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:11.500
That's what it was.

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:18.710
And out of honor for Avogadro,
we name the number of atoms in

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:20.950
the mole the Avogadro number.

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:25.530
Which I've written 6.02
times 10 to the 23rd.

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:28.220
Now how do we determine
Avogadro's number?

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:30.110
That's an interesting story.

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:34.300
So first of all, we need two
pieces of information.

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:37.440
Because we're going to do this
by the noblest form of

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:39.480
chemistry, electrochemistry.

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:42.210
So the first thing we're going
to do is we're going to look

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:49.090
at the work Michael Faraday
in England.

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:51.190
And what Michael Faraday
did is he studied the

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:53.200
electrodeposition of metal.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:57.470
And specifically he passed
current through a cell and he

00:28:57.470 --> 00:28:59.850
electrodeposited silver.

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:04.210
So he starts with silver plus,
that's silver a cation, and by

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:08.000
the action of electric current
attaches an electron to silver

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.790
and renders it neutral.

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:14.820
Silver, which now plates out
onto an electrode and they

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:17.160
measured the mass.

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:21.400
They measured the mass of
silver-plated and they compare

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:26.490
it to the amount of charge
that was passed.

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:27.740
They measured the charge.

00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:33.260
And you can get charge, because
you know current.

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:35.990
So charge is simply equal to
the integral of the current

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:36.830
times the time.

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:38.560
You know the current,
that's easy.

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:47.030
And what Faraday found was that
to make what we now know

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:51.940
to be 108 grams of silver, 108
grams of silver, which we're

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:55.010
going to subsequently recognize
as the mole, which

00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:58.600
is identical to the amount, the
number of particles in 108

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:02.410
grams of silver, is equal to the
number of particles in 12

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:04.770
grams of carbon.

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:08.690
Sort of an Avogadro-type
harkening.

00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:10.330
He found that that is--

00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:15.990
the equivalent requires
96,485 Coulombs.

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:20.230
So you can say 1 mole of
electrons gives me 1 mole of

00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:24.360
silver, so that's the charge on
1 mole of electrons, where

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:28.210
Coulomb is the elementary
charge, because we know 1

00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:35.390
electron per 1 silver
atom deposited.

00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:38.620
So now if I know that's a mole
of electrons, I need to find a

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:41.270
charge on one electron, divide
through and I get

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:42.760
the Avogadro number.

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:46.720
And to finish the story we have
to wait about 50 years

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:50.550
and come to the United States,
where it's Robert Millikan,

00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:54.170
Robert Millikan at the
University of Chicago doing

00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:58.130
the oil drop experiment through
which we learn the

00:30:58.130 --> 00:30:59.540
elementary charge.

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:02.550
And here's the cartoon of
the oil drop experiment.

00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:04.085
I took this from a
different text.

00:31:04.085 --> 00:31:05.940
It's not shown in your text.

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:10.340
So I actually did this
experiment as a sophomore at

00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:11.200
the University of Toronto.

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.410
They had us repeat some of the
great experiments of physics,

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:14.700
the ones that were accessible,
obviously.

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:18.450
I couldn't do high-energy
physics in an afternoon.

00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:20.350
That would have taken me
a little bit longer.

00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:21.680
But we did this one.

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:25.010
And so it consists of an
atomizer, sort of a perfume

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:28.360
atomizer, in which
there's oil.

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:33.000
And by the action of atomization
we form a shower

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.060
here, a very, very fine
dispersion of

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:37.680
tiny droplets of oil.

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:41.200
And then-- this cartoon is hard
to make sense of so I

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.860
fixed this--

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:45.850
we shine high-energy
radiation on this.

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:48.440
And by the action of high energy
radiation we take these

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:51.730
neutral droplets and we
turn them into ions.

00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:55.070
We eject electrons.

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:57.340
And so now these are charged.

00:31:57.340 --> 00:32:00.730
And then we charge the plates.

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:05.400
So if we have neutral species
and they simply come out of

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:08.020
the atomizer, they'll settle
under gravity.

00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:12.090
But now if they're charged and I
put a charge on the plates--

00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:14.310
let's say as here the upper
plate is positive--

00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:17.385
if any of these particles is
charged positive, the action

00:32:17.385 --> 00:32:21.140
of the electric field will
accelerate the descent,

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:23.420
because the bottom plate is
negative attracting and a

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:25.490
positive plate at the
top is repelling.

00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:26.630
And vice versa.

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:29.260
If I have a particle that's
negative, the upper positive

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:31.450
plate will actually cause it
to slow down, and in the

00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:33.850
extreme, it may actually
start to rise.

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:37.490
And so what Millikan did is a
set of experiments in which he

00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:39.880
studied all the different
particle sizes.

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:41.110
See this telescope?

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:43.170
Right over here is Millikan.

00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:44.790
And Millikan's sitting
there and he's

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:46.240
squirting and he's watching.

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:48.610
He's measuring the settling
velocity.

00:32:48.610 --> 00:32:51.370
And he changes the magnitude
of the electric field.

00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:53.590
He changes the intensity
of radiation.

00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:55.255
He changes the nozzle.

00:32:55.255 --> 00:32:56.960
He changes everything he can.

00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:58.090
And what does he find?

00:32:58.090 --> 00:33:01.460
He finds that the distribution
of velocities is not

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:03.200
continuous.

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.750
It's not continuous.

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:07.580
You think, well, gee if you just
keep dialing you should

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:10.020
get every variation
of velocity.

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:11.060
Well, he doesn't.

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:17.690
He finds that he gets variation
down to a single

00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:20.700
value, below which
he can't go.

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:32.440
He determines that electric
charge is quantized.

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:35.080
That is to say there's
a base unit.

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:36.310
It's an element.

00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:39.910
I just talked to you about the
elemental building block.

00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:42.470
That's an element
in mass space.

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:43.170
Now I'm going to go

00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:45.790
conceptually into charge space.

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:49.655
There is an elemental building
block of electric charge.

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:53.840
Electric charge is quantized.

00:33:57.950 --> 00:34:06.450
And he found that the elementary
charge, which we

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:08.270
gave the symbol, e.

00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:10.430
e is not the symbol
for electron.

00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:12.580
e is the symbol for
elementary charge.

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:18.030
It has a value, if you convert
it to modern SI units, of 1.6

00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:24.385
times 10 to the minus
19 Coulombs.

00:34:24.385 --> 00:34:28.960
So now I can take these two
pieces of information, Faraday

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.210
which is up here.

00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:34.190
This is known as the
Faraday Constant.

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:38.810
Script f, Faraday constant.

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:41.440
So if I divide the Faraday
constant, which is the charge

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:44.470
on a mole of electrons, by the
elementary charge, which is

00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:48.010
the charge on one electron,
presumably I should end up

00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:49.350
with the Avogadro number.

00:34:49.350 --> 00:34:52.890
It should be the ratio
of the Faraday to

00:34:52.890 --> 00:34:54.110
the elementary charge.

00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:55.570
And it gives us--

00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:56.890
for the third time
this morning--

00:34:56.890 --> 00:35:00.190
6.02 times 10 to the 23rd.

00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:06.590
If you like per mole, yes
or no, doesn't matter.

00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:09.050
So now, what's the
atomic mass unit?

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:13.650
Now we can say the atomic mass
unit is, 1 atomic mass unit

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:15.370
then must equal what?

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:22.590
It's going to equal 1/12 of
the mass of carbon 12.

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:27.420
1/12 of the mass of carbon 12
divided by the Avogadro

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:34.900
number, which gives us 1.661
times 10 to the minus 27

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:36.320
kilograms.

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:39.500
Now be careful because
the system is just

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:40.450
a little bit rickety.

00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:44.590
You know we went SI, but look,
this is still defined as 12

00:35:44.590 --> 00:35:49.900
grams. And so sometimes if you
look depending on where this

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:54.510
is, 10 to minus 27 kilograms or
10 to the minus 24 grams.

00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:55.760
Just be careful.

00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:05.040
If you ignore this you'll be off
only by factor of 1,000.

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:05.730
That's a joke.

00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:08.250
But it's lost here.

00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:09.410
People are too serious.

00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:10.660
We'll lighten you up.

00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:13.420
All right, so enough
of the history.

00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:15.100
Let's now do something
dynamic.

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:16.930
So far we've been studying
static elements.

00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:21.010
But chemistry is really the
action of elements in motion.

00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:24.060
So how do we describe
a chemical reaction?

00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:25.080
Let's look at that.

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:29.090
What are the rules to describe
a chemical reaction?

00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:31.190
Write an equation.

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:36.179
Write the equation of the
chemical reaction subject to

00:36:36.179 --> 00:36:38.167
these rules.

00:36:38.167 --> 00:36:40.652
There are two simple rules.

00:36:40.652 --> 00:36:45.544
One is conservation of mass.

00:36:45.544 --> 00:36:45.712
We've been told the repeatedly
since Democritus,

00:36:45.712 --> 00:36:47.740
conservation of mass.

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:51.440
And the second thing, we use
Dalton's Law of Molar

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:52.690
Proportions.

00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:02.750
That is to say, the building
blocks in integer ratios.

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:08.950
And so I thought I'd
do this in context.

00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:11.710
So I've got a specific
example here.

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:13.940
So this is something that
I'm interested in.

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:17.810
Some of my research is in
metallurgical extraction by

00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:18.910
benign processes.

00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:21.400
What you're looking at is
a billet of titanium.

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:23.470
To give you a sense, you can see
the stairwell back here.

00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:26.770
So this is about 4 feet, a
little over a meter here.

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:29.720
So you can see this is one
honking big piece of titanium.

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:32.890
This came out of the primary
reactor, the Kroll reactor and

00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:36.910
this is subsequently swaged and
hot worked and so on to

00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:37.760
form these billets.

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:41.920
So this is the first step of
turning dirt into metal.

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:43.285
That's called titanium sponge.

00:37:43.285 --> 00:37:48.550
And titanium sponge occurs
inside a Kroll reactor.

00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:51.780
It occurs inside a Kroll
reactor, which was invented by

00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:56.440
a man of the surname Kroll in
Luxembourg in the 1930s.

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:59.870
And then with the advent of
World War II, he decided to be

00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:01.120
smart, to get out.

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:04.190
And he ended up in Oregon where
he became a professor.

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:06.580
So he's known as Professor
Kroll, although the truth be

00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:08.560
told he really made
his discovery

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:09.820
before he became a professor.

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:12.380
But he's still a professor
and so we'll honor him.

00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:19.970
And so the Kroll process for
making titanium centers around

00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:21.200
this reaction.

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:27.280
Here's the reaction written
according to the rules above.

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:30.460
We take titanium dioxide, which
is found in the Earth

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:33.910
and by some prior chemistry
convert it to titanium

00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:37.200
tetrachloride, and in a reactor
that I'm going to show

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:39.190
you in a moment, we
react titanium

00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:41.150
tetrachloride with magnesium.

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:44.040
And magnesium has a higher
affinity for chlorine than

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:48.660
does titanium and steals the
chlorine from titanium to form

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:53.130
magnesium chloride, leaving
behind titanium metal.

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:55.760
Now we have to have conservation
of mass.

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:58.860
So you can see, I've got 4
chlorines on the left but only

00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:00.130
2 chlorines on the right.

00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:02.930
So I'm going to put a
2 here and double

00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:04.140
the magnesium chloride.

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:06.070
But now I've got 2 magnesiums
on the right and

00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:07.330
only 1 on the left.

00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:09.920
So I'll put a 2 in front of the
magnesium and now we have

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:11.170
a balanced equation.

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:17.580
And here's what the reactor
looks like.

00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:21.370
You can imagine a giant vessel
with a pressure seal on the

00:39:21.370 --> 00:39:24.660
top and a couple of valves,
big enough to make this.

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:27.900
So this is about 15
feet by 30 feet.

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:32.210
And so we introduce titanium
tetrachloride, which is a gas,

00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:36.760
and magnesium as a solid and
heat to 900 degrees C.

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:39.310
And at 900 degrees C, if you
look on your Periodic Table

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:42.450
you'll know that magnesium
melts at 650 degrees C.

00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:45.250
So we have a liquid sitting
here, titanium tetrachloride

00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:47.830
here, and this thing
is sealed.

00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:49.550
It's called a bomb reactor.

00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:51.190
Nothing can get in, nothing
can get out.

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:52.630
The pressure builds up here.

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:55.100
And right at this interface
the titanium tetrachloride

00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:57.840
reacts with the magnesium
according to this reaction.

00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:59.280
Now this is very interesting.

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:01.530
It's beautiful reaction
because the titanium

00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:04.880
tetrachloride is a gas;
magnesium is a liquid.

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:07.740
Magnesium chloride is a liquid,
but it is of different

00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:11.300
density, and it is insoluble
in magnesium, and titanium

00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:13.620
melts at 1670 and
it's a solid.

00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:16.260
So what happens over
time is this.

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:19.920
The magnesium chloride that
forms pools underneath the

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:22.790
magnesium liquid, gets out
of the way so that we can

00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:25.750
continue to keep this interface
clean and have the

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:26.970
reaction proceed.

00:40:26.970 --> 00:40:31.630
You don't want to reaction where
reactant A reacts with

00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:34.710
reactant B, makes a product that
covers the interface and

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:38.000
now the product is in the
way of future reaction.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.760
So this is very elegant because
I don't need any fans,

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:43.420
I don't need any nose
propellers, nothing.

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:46.110
By density the magnesium
chloride settles and the

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:47.370
titanium settles.

00:40:47.370 --> 00:40:48.740
And it's sitting here
at the bottom.

00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:51.010
And you can imagine if we do
this long enough, this

00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:54.120
titanium at the bottom will
continue to build until it

00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:56.190
looks like this.

00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:59.342
As long as you keep feeding
TiCl and Mg.

00:40:59.342 --> 00:41:01.160
See I'm talking metallurgy
now.

00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:04.980
TiCl and Mg, that's
what you make.

00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:08.350
So that's how we make titanium,
first step.

00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:12.120
And so suppose you get hired and
it's your first day on the

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:19.500
job and you're working at
Cambridge Titanium and the

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:29.160
boss says let's put in 200
kilograms of TiCl and we'll

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:34.060
put in 25 kilograms of Mg.

00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:38.590
And the question is,
what is the yield?

00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:39.670
What is the yield?

00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:42.590
How much titanium are
we going to make?

00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:44.240
Well, you say, just
multiply it out.

00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:47.940
But first you have to see if
things are in balance.

00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:52.410
We have to study the
stoichiometry of the reaction.

00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:54.260
Stoichiometry, what
does this mean?

00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:56.590
It's from the Greek, stoicheia,
which has to do

00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:59.300
with measurement proportions.

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:04.740
So if these are not put in to
the reactor in proportion to

00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:07.360
what they are in the equation
we're not going to get the

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:08.870
yield here.

00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:12.250
So first thing I gotta do, this
is in moles, this is in

00:42:12.250 --> 00:42:15.700
kilograms. So I have to convert
the kilograms to moles

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:17.660
and then maybe I can make
some sense of this.

00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:21.255
So if I divide by the atomic
mass of titanium, four times

00:42:21.255 --> 00:42:24.910
the atomic mass of chlorine and
convert; I will discover

00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:30.770
that I have 1,054
moles of TiCl.

00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:36.770
And I've got about 1,029
moles of magnesium.

00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:43.170
Well, this equation says I need
2 times the amount of

00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:44.160
titanium tetrachloride.

00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:47.180
Well, it's obvious to the naked
eye, 1,029 isn't two

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:49.150
times 1,054.

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:50.690
So I've got a problem here.

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:54.290
I'm not going to get as much
titanium as I put in.

00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:55.540
Titanium chloride.

00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:57.930
This yield is going
to be restricted.

00:42:57.930 --> 00:43:00.510
It's going to be restricted by--
this is sort of a chain

00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:02.420
is as strong as its
weakest link--

00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:06.910
the yield is restricted by the
amount of limiting reagent.

00:43:06.910 --> 00:43:11.820
And in this case, magnesium is--
this is less than 2 times

00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:15.630
the mole number of titanium
chloride.

00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:17.950
So this means this is the
limiting reagent.

00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:26.470
Alright so now if we use that
principle then I'm only going

00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:28.910
to get as much titanium as I had
magnesium and you can see

00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:32.140
from the stoichiometry here,
if I've got 1,029 moles of

00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:33.800
magnesium I'm going
to have half of

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:35.510
that number of titanium.

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:42.430
So therefore the amount of
titanium is equal to 515 moles

00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:43.410
of titanium.

00:43:43.410 --> 00:43:46.730
And you notice I'm not obsessed
about a significant

00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:47.600
figures and so on.

00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:49.980
It's a metallurgical plant.

00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:51.990
Half of 1,029 is 515.

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:53.900
Is it 514.5?

00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:54.590
If you wish.

00:43:54.590 --> 00:43:55.060
I don't care.

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:59.330
So 515 moles and then I convert
that, which gives me

00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:05.430
24.7 kilograms of titanium
when I use

00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:07.240
that amount of magnesium.

00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:11.720
And if you go to the text,
Section 2.7, you'll see the

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:14.580
nuts and bolts of how to
run these reactions.

00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:16.355
For those of you who had a lot
of chemistry in high school, I

00:44:16.355 --> 00:44:18.900
know this is review, but I want
to bring everybody up to

00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:20.600
the same page.

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:23.530
So we're starting with this.

00:44:23.530 --> 00:44:24.070
All right.

00:44:24.070 --> 00:44:26.940
I think that's a pretty
good place to

00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:28.930
stop with the delivery.

00:44:28.930 --> 00:44:31.130
But I don't want you moving.

00:44:31.130 --> 00:44:31.690
You don't move yet.

00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:33.080
Because the last 5 minutes
I'm going to

00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:34.150
still continue to talk.

00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:36.040
But on a slightly
different topic.

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:38.320
And so I don't want to
hear the binders

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:41.020
snapping and so on.

00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:42.590
We're here; you paid
your money.

00:44:42.590 --> 00:44:44.150
Five more minutes.

00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:46.090
Five more minutes and then
you're out there.

00:44:46.090 --> 00:44:48.200
Out there, then begins
le weekend.

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:49.820
But not until then.

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:51.260
So a couple of things.

00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:52.960
First is, the music today.

00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:54.760
I try to link the music
thematically.

00:44:54.760 --> 00:45:01.260
So the music playing today was
Polovstian Dance number 17

00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:05.510
from Prince Igor, by Borodin,
Aleksandr Borodin.

00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:07.210
Why were we listening
to this music?

00:45:07.210 --> 00:45:09.870
Well, because I insisted
that we listen to it.

00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:11.060
Well, what about Borodin?

00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:13.270
Borodin lived in Saint
Petersburg.

00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:14.860
He was a friend of Mendeleyev.

00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:19.100
OK, that's cute but more
importantly Borodin wrote his

00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:20.930
music in his leisure time.

00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:22.050
He had a day job.

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:25.690
His day job was professor
of chemistry.

00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:28.570
And he worked at the Medical
Surgical Academy in Saint

00:45:28.570 --> 00:45:29.630
Petersburg.

00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:31.920
He was an exceptional
human being.

00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:34.980
In those days, women were
forbidden to attend

00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:36.830
institutions of higher
education.

00:45:36.830 --> 00:45:42.190
He set up an entire curriculum
for women in a night school at

00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:44.710
the Medical Surgical Academy.

00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:47.560
He cavorted with artists and
therefore obviously his

00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:48.810
politics were radical.

00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:51.890
And they were trying to reform
the political scene in Czarist

00:45:51.890 --> 00:45:53.440
Russia at the time.

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:56.700
And he was also quite
a bon vivant.

00:45:56.700 --> 00:46:03.080
And he died on his feet
dancing at a ball.

00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:04.570
So that's the way to go.

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:06.200
Having a great time.

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:07.450
That was Borodin.

00:46:09.590 --> 00:46:11.160
One other thing before you go.

00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:14.680
You were very very dour, so I
thought I'd try to put you in

00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:17.800
a good mood to the extent this
is possible with this group.

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:22.050
And I wanted to share
with you some news.

00:46:22.050 --> 00:46:23.780
There's been a new element
discovered.

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:26.640
You know these atoms smashers,
they're always working.

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:29.340
And so the discovery of the
heaviest element known to

00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:31.170
science has been reported.

00:46:31.170 --> 00:46:33.750
The element, tentatively
named administratium.

00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:39.530
I don't know if UPEC is going
to go for this, but you can

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:41.910
suggest names.

00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:44.430
So they're going to name
is administratium, the

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:47.240
discoverers.

00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:50.830
It has no protons
or electrons.

00:46:50.830 --> 00:46:55.500
So that means its atomic
number is 0.

00:46:55.500 --> 00:47:00.850
It does have one neutron, 125
assistants to the neutron.

00:47:00.850 --> 00:47:04.820
75 vice-neutrons and a
111 assistants to the

00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:06.360
vice-neutrons.

00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:11.580
This gives it a mass
number of 312.

00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:14.660
The 312 particles are held
together in the nucleus by a

00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:17.210
force that involves the
continuous exchange of

00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:21.430
meson-like particles
called memo-ons.

00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:24.470
There's no electronic mail,
because there's no electrons.

00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:27.220
There may be neutronic mail
but we don't know yet.

00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:29.110
Now you've already learned
something today.

00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:30.220
You know something.

00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:32.640
Since it has no electrons,
what do we know about its

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:34.820
chemical reactivity?

00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:35.805
It's inert.

00:47:35.805 --> 00:47:37.080
It has no electrons.

00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:38.230
It can't exchange.

00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:39.450
So this is chemically inert.

00:47:39.450 --> 00:47:42.920
So you say, how did
they detect it?

00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:44.940
Because it seems to impede
every reaction in

00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:46.190
which it is a present.

00:47:49.290 --> 00:47:53.010
According to the discoverers
a few nanograms rendered a

00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:58.420
reaction that normally takes a
fraction of a second, it took

00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:01.635
now four business days
to conduct that same.

00:48:04.450 --> 00:48:07.370
There are a few other
properties.

00:48:07.370 --> 00:48:10.030
We know so far that
it's radioactive.

00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:11.990
And we're going to study
radioactivity later, so

00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:13.830
there's a little bit
of foreshadowing.

00:48:13.830 --> 00:48:16.850
It has a half-life of about
three years, at which time it

00:48:16.850 --> 00:48:22.240
stops decaying and instead it
undergoes a reorganization, in

00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:24.780
which the vice-neutrons,
assistants to the neutrons and

00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:25.310
assistants to the

00:48:25.310 --> 00:48:27.810
vice-neutrons, exchange places.

00:48:27.810 --> 00:48:32.040
Some studies indicate that the
mass actually increases after

00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:33.760
each reorganization.

00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:36.970
So you can imagine now we'll
have something like this.

00:48:40.590 --> 00:48:43.270
See how this increased?

00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:47.370
So if they occupy the same
place, they have the same

00:48:47.370 --> 00:48:51.110
proton number, but a different
neutron number, in the case of

00:48:51.110 --> 00:48:55.080
administratium, they're
called isodopes.

00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:57.820
So with that I will say,
have a good weekend.
