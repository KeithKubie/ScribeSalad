00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.360
This episode of Dnews is brought to you by
BASF, THE Chemical Company.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.890
The sun is cool and all, but is there a way
we can use it to make our lives better?

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.480
..It just dawned on me.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:20.000
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and I apologize
for that awful pun earlier.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.360
It's a sickness and I can't stop.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.310
Anyway, we've been talking a lot lately about
simple things you can do at home to decrease

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.800
your carbon footprint.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.040
Recently I showed you how to start your own
backyard compost, and today - I'm gonna be

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.840
talking about solar power.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.610
Now typically when people hear solar power,
they think of solar panels - which are great

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.680
for the environment.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.180
But they're also expensive and complicated
to install.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.801
But that's ok - because it turns out, there
are tons of solar-powered devices out there

00:00:45.801 --> 00:00:49.630
- that don't require installation, that you
probably never even knew existed.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.400
A keyboard, for example, is something almost
everyone uses - and Logitech makes one that's

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.180
reasonably priced and runs on solar power.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.190
What's even cooler about this one, is that
you don't need natural sunlight to charge

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.190
it.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.140
Any light source will work, including a desk
lamp.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.899
And it has great reviews, too - one person
on Amazon said they kept it in a dark room

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:12.170
for several months, and the power level never
dipped below 100%, which is pretty insane

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.340
when you think about it.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.909
Another product that's nowhere near as useful
as a keyboard - but interesting, nonetheless

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:18.990
- a solar-powered bikini!

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.420
For the person who has everything, except
shame.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.170
This was created by Brooklyn-based designer
Andrew Schneider, who spends around 80 hours

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.810
on each one, hand-stitching hundreds of strips
of photovoltaic film together with conductive

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:32.810
thread.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.600
Of course the downside, is that you can't
actually use it in water, but hey - if checking

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.350
Facebook at the beach is THAT important to
you, you can always custom order one through

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.509
his website.

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.499
For a less girly product, a company called
Husqvarna makes a line of solar hybrid robotic

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:49.810
lawnmowers - like Roombas, but for your yard.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.810
These are pretty pricey, around $2-4K, BUT
their list of features is pretty damn impressive.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.740
They can be used at night, in the rain, on
steep hills, on uneven grass - and did you

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.279
notice they look like mini-Batmobiles?!

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:09.049
If your dream is to own a Batmobile, and you
have 4,000 dollars lying around - it would

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:12.230
be downright irresponsible of you, not to
buy this.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.230
Yeah.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.230
I said it.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.280
All the money in the world can't buy this
next product - but that doesn't make it any

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.410
less amazing.

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.430
A pair of Swiss aviation pioneers recently
unveiled the Solar Impulse 2, a single-person

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.879
aircraft powered entirely by the sun.

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:30.040
The surface of the plane is covered with 17,000
solar cells, and custom-made lithium batteries

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.440
store that energy for nighttime - making it
the only plane in the world with unlimited

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.599
endurance.

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.640
To raise awareness about clean energy, its
creators will attempt the first 5-day, non-stop

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.769
flight around the world in March 2015.

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.079
And since I know you're all wondering - yes,
the seat does double as a toilet.

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:49.980
God the future is incredible.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.430
And hey, speaking of great inventions - Discovery
Digital and BASF are teaming up once again,

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.829
to get kids to use their imagination and demonstrate
their knowledge of all things science.

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.569
Children in grades K-8 are encouraged to submit
a 2-4 minute video about an educational and

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:09.050
creative science experiment related to chemistry,
sustainability, innovation, technology, or

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.050
energy.

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.439
One Grand Prize winner will receive a $10,000
college scholarship and an iPad, along with

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:16.280
a Stuff To Blow Your Mind prize pack.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.090
All you have to do to enter, is submit your
video to stufftoblowyourmind.com/science-awards

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.480
by May 23rd.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.159
The winner will be announced June 6th, and
the winning experiment will be featured on

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:31.299
StuffToBlowYourMind.com - so if you wanna
be internet famous while spreading the gospel

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.909
of science, be sure to get your videos in
by May 23rd.

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:38.390
That's all for me, but as always - you can
