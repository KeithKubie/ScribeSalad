00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.280
Some of the most important regions for turning on

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.600
coding genes the right time and the right place are

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.315
called promoters. A promoter is simply a region of

00:00:09.315 --> 00:00:14.580
non-coding DNA that initiates transcription of a particular gene. Now

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.320
what's really important to realize if this is new

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.730
to you That this is not a start codon. This

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.450
is not the same thing as a start codon. Remember

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.186
that a start codon is important for translation of an

00:00:27.186 --> 00:00:27.430
[UNKNOWN]

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.420
sequence into amino acids. The promoter is indicating

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.220
the initiation of transcription which is very different, right,

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.860
it's the first step in the central dogma.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.110
Take a look here at this hypothetical gene sequence.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.300
We have five axons in purple, and four

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.570
entrons in between these five axons. This arrow right

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.080
here indicates the initiating point for transcription. The

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.590
plus one says hey, this is the first nucleotide

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.690
that's transcribed here in this processing going from the gene

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.170
to the MRNA copy. And transcription is going to start here

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.940
at this plus one site and go all the way

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.349
to this line here, where it stops. The introns will be

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:07.840
spliced out, and we'll get an mRNA copy of just

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.610
the exons. What I want you to tell is, which region

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.390
you think is most likely to be the promoter region.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.310
This region here in front of the gene before transcription begins?

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.120
This region here, in the middle of the gene, where we see it spans one exon, an

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.540
intron, and another exon? Or do you think

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.240
it's this region over here, after transcription's already terminated

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.090
for the gene? Go ahead and pick which

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.380
region you think is most likely the promoter. And

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.870
then I want you to tell me why by

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.330
writing a brief response in this text box here.
