00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:08.032
There's a prevailing attitude

00:00:08.032 --> 00:00:10.710
that art doesn't matter in the real world.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.651
But the study of art can enhance our perception

00:00:13.651 --> 00:00:17.021
and our ability to translate to others what we see.

00:00:17.021 --> 00:00:18.629
Those skills are useful.

00:00:18.629 --> 00:00:20.547
Those skills can save lives.

00:00:20.547 --> 00:00:23.064
Doctors, nurses, and law enforcement agents

00:00:23.064 --> 00:00:25.730
can use painting, sculpture, and photography

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.259
as tools to improve their visual acuity

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:29.674
and communication skills,

00:00:29.674 --> 00:00:30.496
which are critical

00:00:30.496 --> 00:00:32.708
during investigations and emergencies.

00:00:32.708 --> 00:00:34.180
If you're treating an injury,

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.929
investigating a crime scene,

00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:38.122
or trying to describe either of those things

00:00:38.122 --> 00:00:39.458
to a colleague,

00:00:39.458 --> 00:00:41.478
art can make you better at it.

00:00:41.478 --> 00:00:43.322
Here, imagine you're a seasoned cop

00:00:43.322 --> 00:00:44.853
or a dedicated doctor,

00:00:44.853 --> 00:00:47.104
but also imagine you are at a museum

00:00:47.104 --> 00:00:49.175
and let's look at a painting.

00:00:49.175 --> 00:00:52.479
Rene Magritte's "Time Transfixed" of 1938

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:55.731
depicts a mysterious and complex interior

00:00:55.731 --> 00:00:57.237
that invites analysis

00:00:57.237 --> 00:01:00.649
not unlike that required of a patient's symptoms

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:02.693
or the scene of a crime.

00:01:02.693 --> 00:01:04.884
A miniature train whose origin

00:01:04.884 --> 00:01:06.987
and destination are unknown

00:01:06.987 --> 00:01:08.987
is emerging from a fireplace,

00:01:08.987 --> 00:01:10.764
and the smoke from the locomotive

00:01:10.764 --> 00:01:13.017
appears to flow up the chimney

00:01:13.017 --> 00:01:14.631
as if from the fire

00:01:14.631 --> 00:01:17.727
that is conspicuously absent below.

00:01:17.727 --> 00:01:19.071
The eeriness of the scene

00:01:19.071 --> 00:01:21.322
is echoed in the empty living room,

00:01:21.322 --> 00:01:23.431
enhanced by wood-grain floors

00:01:23.431 --> 00:01:24.942
and decorative wall moldings

00:01:24.942 --> 00:01:27.361
to the right of the fireplace.

00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:29.120
Perched atop the mantelpiece

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.455
are two candlesticks and a clock.

00:01:31.455 --> 00:01:34.643
Behind these objects is a large mirror

00:01:34.643 --> 00:01:36.418
that reveals an empty interior

00:01:36.418 --> 00:01:38.415
and only a partial reflection

00:01:38.415 --> 00:01:40.278
of the objects before it.

00:01:40.278 --> 00:01:42.668
The juxtaposition of the objects

00:01:42.668 --> 00:01:44.032
surrounding the moving train

00:01:44.032 --> 00:01:46.055
raises numerous questions

00:01:46.055 --> 00:01:49.541
for which there seem to be no apparent answers.

00:01:49.541 --> 00:01:51.590
Did I summarize the painting accurately

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.139
or leave any details out?

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:54.293
It's no big deal

00:01:54.293 --> 00:01:56.196
if you see something else in a painting,

00:01:56.196 --> 00:01:58.473
but what if we're both seasoned cops?

00:01:58.473 --> 00:01:59.528
I call you for back-up.

00:01:59.528 --> 00:02:01.012
You show up only to realize

00:02:01.012 --> 00:02:03.280
the two bank robbing ninjas I'd mentioned

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.093
were actually six bank robbing ninjas with lasers.

00:02:07.093 --> 00:02:09.290
Close study of art can train viewers

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:10.875
to study thoroughly,

00:02:10.875 --> 00:02:12.812
analyze the elements observed,

00:02:12.812 --> 00:02:14.792
articulate them succinctly,

00:02:14.792 --> 00:02:16.206
and formulate questions

00:02:16.206 --> 00:02:19.236
to address the seeming inconsistencies.

00:02:19.236 --> 00:02:20.498
Scrutinizing the details

00:02:20.498 --> 00:02:22.126
of an unfamiliar scene,

00:02:22.126 --> 00:02:23.922
in this case the work of art,

00:02:23.922 --> 00:02:25.376
and accurately conveying

00:02:25.376 --> 00:02:27.452
any observable contradictions

00:02:27.452 --> 00:02:29.536
is a critically important skill

00:02:29.536 --> 00:02:31.621
for both people who look at x-rays

00:02:31.621 --> 00:02:34.166
and those who interrogate suspects.

00:02:34.166 --> 00:02:36.922
Let's interrogate this painting, shall we?

00:02:36.922 --> 00:02:40.261
Okay, Magritte, that's quite a little picture you've painted.

00:02:40.261 --> 00:02:43.148
But why aren't there any train tracks?

00:02:43.148 --> 00:02:44.563
Why no fire?

00:02:44.563 --> 00:02:46.347
What happened to the candles?

00:02:46.347 --> 00:02:47.682
Why doesn't the fireplace

00:02:47.682 --> 00:02:49.872
have a little tunnel for the train?

00:02:49.872 --> 00:02:52.207
It just comes straight through the wall.

00:02:52.207 --> 00:02:53.240
And the clock says

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.962
it's about quarter to one,

00:02:54.962 --> 00:02:56.234
but I'm not sure the light

00:02:56.234 --> 00:02:57.992
that comes through the window at an angle

00:02:57.992 --> 00:03:00.279
says it's just past noontime.

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:02.497
What's this painting all about, anyway?

00:03:02.497 --> 00:03:04.628
That's when you, my trusty partner,

00:03:04.628 --> 00:03:05.712
hold me back,

00:03:05.712 --> 00:03:06.960
then I leave.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.460
You give Magritte a cup of coffee

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.511
and keep grilling him

00:03:09.511 --> 00:03:12.551
to see if this painting would hold up in court.

00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:14.604
Viewers can provide a more detailed

00:03:14.604 --> 00:03:17.209
and accurate description of a situation

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.206
by articulating what is seen

00:03:19.206 --> 00:03:21.461
and what is not seen.

00:03:21.461 --> 00:03:23.952
This is particularly important in medicine.

00:03:23.952 --> 00:03:27.187
If an illness is evidenced by three symptoms

00:03:27.187 --> 00:03:29.673
and only two are present in a patient,

00:03:29.673 --> 00:03:32.762
a medical professional must explicitly state

00:03:32.762 --> 00:03:34.989
the absence of that third symptom,

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.269
signifying that the patient

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.272
may not have the condition suspected.

00:03:39.272 --> 00:03:42.928
Articulating the absence of a specific detail or behavior

00:03:42.928 --> 00:03:45.367
known as the pertinent negative

00:03:45.367 --> 00:03:47.238
is as critical as stating

00:03:47.238 --> 00:03:49.757
the details and behaviors that are present

00:03:49.757 --> 00:03:52.035
in order to treat the patient.

00:03:52.035 --> 00:03:55.430
And conspicuous absences are only conspicuous

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.099
to eyes trained to look for them.

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:59.683
Art teaches professionals

00:03:59.683 --> 00:04:01.935
across a wide spectrum of fields

00:04:01.935 --> 00:04:04.675
not only how to ask more effective questions

00:04:04.675 --> 00:04:06.927
about what cannot be readily answered,

00:04:06.927 --> 00:04:09.135
but also, and more importantly,

00:04:09.135 --> 00:04:12.234
how to analyze complex, real world situations

00:04:12.234 --> 00:04:14.517
from a new and different perspective,

00:04:14.517 --> 00:04:17.940
ultimately solving difficult problems.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.352
Intense attention to detail,

00:04:19.352 --> 00:04:21.390
the ability to take a step back

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.689
and look differently,

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:25.734
we want first responders to have the analytical skills

00:04:25.734 --> 00:04:28.681
of master art historians at least.

00:04:28.681 --> 00:04:30.537
Art trains us to investigate,

00:04:30.537 --> 00:04:34.363
and that's a real world skill if there ever was one.
