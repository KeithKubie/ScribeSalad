00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.510
&gt;&gt; Harrison Smith: Good morning.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.100
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.400
&gt;&gt; Harrison Smith: Lovely
to see everyone today.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.510
My name is Harrison
Smith, and I am a reporter

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.650
with the Kids Post section
of The Washington Post.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.480
And it is my great honor today
to introduce Ali Benjamin, who,

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.130
as we all know, is the
best-selling author

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.620
of "The Thing About Jellyfish."

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.220
"The Thing About Jellyfish" won
a national book award, excuse me,

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.200
was a National Book Award
finalist just last year.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.260
And it tells the story of a
12-year-old girl, Suzy Swanson,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.130
who believes that her
friend, Franny,

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.480
died not because of a swimming
accident, but because of a sting

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.490
of a rare jellyfish, a teeny, tiny,

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.730
many-tentacled animal
called the Irukandji.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.050
"The Thing About Jellyfish"
is a book,

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.050
not just about venomous jellies,
of course, but about grief

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.350
and friendship, and even
the scientific method.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.960
It delves into the nature of
extinction, and the awareness

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.640
of a funny thing called
zombie ants, which,

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.150
as one of the characters explains,

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.830
are ants whose brains have been
taken over by a funny fungus.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.810
In a review for The New York Times,

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.690
the writer Jacqueline Kelly
praised Ali's "dreamy,

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.590
meditative and elegiac prose."

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.450
And it's a style of writing
that she honed over the years,

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.050
working primarily as
a non-fiction writer.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.110
She's the co-author of a pair
of memoirs, "The Keeper,"

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.500
about U.S. soccer goalie
Tim Howard, and "Positive,"

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.600
about a middle-schooler's
struggles with HIV.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.930
With Beth Bader, she also
wrote "The Cleaner Plate Club,"

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.230
a recipe book designed

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.690
to help parents feed kids
something a little healthier

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.170
than potato chips or PB &amp; Js.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.190
And in 2011, one year after
the release of that book,

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.790
Ali also worked on television,
as the story researcher

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.610
and casting director for
"Growing Hope Against Hunger,"

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.900
an hour-long Sesame Street
special about child hunger,

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.920
and that won an Emmy award

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.050
for outstanding children's
non-fiction program.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.830
There will be time for questions
after the talk, fortunately,

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.790
and I should add that anyone who
has a question will be filmed

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.200
for The Library of
Congress' archives.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.190
Ali is also going to be signing
books today from noon to 1 pm.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.100
Before we start, I want to thank
the Festival's co-chairman,

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.900
David Rubinstein, and the many
National Book Festival sponsors

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.960
who made this event
possible in 2016.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.210
The Washington Post is a
charter sponsor of the Festival,

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.220
and The Library of
Congress has been its host

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.250
since the Book Fest
began 16 years ago.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.810
If you'd like, you, too, can
support the Festival whether

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.470
through making a donation,
there's some information about that

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.120
in your programs, or
by joining me now

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.510
in welcoming Ali Benjamin
at the stage.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:52.380
[ Applause ]

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.150
&gt;&gt; Ali Benjamin: Hi, guys.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.010
Oh, that's not going to work.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.310
How's everybody doing?

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.610
Good? Great.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.980
So I'm going to be talking a
little bit about the book today,

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.570 position:56%
but I'm actually going to be talking
more about the theme of curiosity.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.860
Somebody recently asked me to sum
up this book in a single word.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.160
And that is the word, curiosity.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:17.660
It begins with -- wait, where
is my Bluetooth clicker?

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:18.960
Sorry. Here we go.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:25.470
The story of the book
begins with this kid.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.500
This is my younger daughter, who,
from the time she was an infant,

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.270
was crazy about sea life and fish.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.160
And we live in rural Massachusetts,
we're surrounded by farms.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.610
There's no ocean nearby.

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.190
But if we walked into a Petco
and there were some fish swimming

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.150
in a fish tank, she would start
quivering with excitement.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.430
I, myself, never thought
that much about the sea.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.640
I would go to the beach
sometimes, but what do you see

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.940
when you go to the beach?

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.220
You look at the water, and you
see the surface of the water.

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.920
You don't see what's underneath.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.920
And I never really spent
very much time wondering

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.410
about what was underneath.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.820
I never thought about jellyfish
other than if I saw one

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.870
in the water, I would get
right out of the water.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.390
But she was really curious, and
she wanted to read as many books

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.690
about sea life as she could.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.530
So one day, she had a
day off from school,

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.340
and I have an older daughter, too.

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.890
They're very, very different,
and I was trying to think,

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.330
what can I do that both girls
are going to want to do?

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.030
And we went into Boston,
and we went to the aquarium.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.770
And it was a very loud
day at the aquarium.

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.900
It was -- there were a lot
of school groups there.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.650
It was very, very crowded, and it
was really, like, it was great,

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.460
but at a certain point, I
wanted some peace and quiet.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.290
And so we sought out the quietest
room in the place, which happened

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.220
to be the jellyfish exhibit.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.030
And I really went there only
looking for some peace and quiet.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.460
But while I was there, I was
looking at these creatures

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.490
that were behind glass and
they're sort of moving,

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.690
and I thought they look kind of
like space aliens, and they're kind

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.130
of pulsing, and I was
thinking holy cow,

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.990 position:56%
like the ocean is filled with these.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.170
We're occupying the same earth,
we're occupying the same space,

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.350
and I don't know anything
about them.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.540
I don't know how they eat,
I don't know what they eat,

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:14.900
and so I started wondering.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.260
I'm just going to take a few
minutes to talk about curiosity.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.120 position:56%
Albert Einstein said that he was
never particularly clever or gifted.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.490
All he was was really curious.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.310
Walt Disney said something
very similar,

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.040
that curiosity leads
us down new paths.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.700
Eleanor Roosevelt said that if a
fairy godmother could endow a child

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.700
with one gift at birth, that
gift should be curiosity.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:42.600
I could go on and on and on
with slides about curiosity.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.310
This is me with my nephew.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.340
He is a toddler.

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.820
I see that there are a lot
of parents in the audience.

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.610
What do toddlers do a lot of?

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.820
They do a lot of asking
questions, right?

00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:00.090
There's actually a researcher who
has gone into homes with toddlers

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.390
and investigated how many
questions toddlers ask

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:07.320
that are actively seeking
information about the world.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:08.620
Why is it this way?

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:09.920
Why is it this way?

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.150
And she said, on average,
it's like 100 questions a day.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.470
Now sometimes when I go into
school groups, I'll ask the kids

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:15.790
to do some quick calculations.

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:21.250
100 questions a day, 365 days a
year, over the course of two years,

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.000
anybody know off-hand
how many -- any kids?

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.880
Can you say how many questions?

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.180
You're nodding.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.480
How many questions would that
be over the course of two years?

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.400
73,000, but yeah, it's
a lot of questions.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.470
Which is why, when you see parents
of toddlers, they are often, like,

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:44.560
oh, my goodness, I just
need some peace and quiet.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.290
But something interesting
happens over time.

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:50.620
This is a chart that I won't
go into in too much detail,

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:55.180
but that yellow line there is the
number of questions that kids ask

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.320
that are actively seeking
information about the world,

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.460
because that same researcher
who went into the homes

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.700
of toddlers also went
into school classrooms.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:06.200
And you notice that the questions
sort of rise dramatically,

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:11.240 position:56%
and then they start tapering off,
to the point where when they are 18,

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.930
it's a fraction of what they were.

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:14.550
And she actually went
into classrooms

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.890
and evaluated how many
information-seeking questions kids

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:22.420
tended to ask over the
average hour in a classroom.

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:25.270
And are there any guesses
about how many that would be?

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:29.150
One hour. How many
questions in a classroom?

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:30.530
&gt;&gt; Two.

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:31.830
&gt;&gt; Ali Benjamin: Two?

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:33.130
&gt;&gt; Eight.

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:34.430
&gt;&gt; Ali Benjamin: Eight?

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.140
Anyone else?

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.080
Guys, the answer is zero.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.570
In the average classroom, there
are questions being asked,

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:46.060
but they tend to be questions like
"is this going to be on the test?"

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.120
Which is not the kind of
questions that we're talking about.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.560
So sometimes I ask kids
to give me their theories

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.860
about why that might be.

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:57.010
What's their hypotheses about
why do we stop asking questions

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:58.980
as we get older?

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:02.280
And by the way, that's a
fifth and six grade classroom.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:06.430
Any kids have any theories
about why?

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:07.730
And I don't have the answer.

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:09.490
I'll just say I don't
have the answer.

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:10.790
All right.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:13.400
I'll tell you what
answers I often get.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.290
Kids will say to me, "Well, we
can look things up ourselves."

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:20.790
And I think that is a great
response, because that's true.

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:22.250
And they say, "Well, we know more."

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:24.150 position:56%
Except then often another kid points

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:27.730
out that every question you
get an answer to actually opens

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:30.700
up more questions, so
theoretically, the more you know,

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.310
the more you're actually
going to ask.

00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:35.190
And I can tell you, I have
talked to school groups all

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:36.560
over the country at this point.

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.380
In every single classroom, there
is a kid who raises their hand

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.720
who says, "Because
you're embarrassed."

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:49.000 position:56%
Because you're embarrassed to ask a
question, because asking a question,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.850 position:56%
what you're curious about, reveals
something about yourself that starts

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:54.150
to make you feel exposed.

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:55.680 position:56%
And I don't think it's a coincidence

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.950
that the questions really start
going down when kids become aware

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:03.950
of themselves as an entity that
other people might be looking

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:06.310
at when they have that
self-awareness.

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:10.390
I became curious about jellyfish.

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:12.140
I started asking questions.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:16.290
And all I was seeking at the
beginning was to learn more.

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.280
I went to the gift shop at the
aquarium that day and I looked

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.580
for a book about jellyfish.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:21.880
I couldn't find one.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.180
We went to a bookstore
that afternoon.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.480
I went to the science section,

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.690
to the non-fiction section,
to the kids section.

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:28.630
I couldn't find any books about it.

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:29.930
I went home.

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:32.970
I went onto Amazon thinking
surely they've got something.

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:34.710
And I couldn't find anything.

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:38.700
I couldn't find anything that
had really good concrete value.

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.620 position:56%
But I started reading these magazine
articles from science magazines

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:45.990
and New York Times
articles, and I was like,

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:48.350
"This is really interesting stuff."

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:51.640
We're going to play a true
or false game right now.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.180
True or false?

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:55.440
Jellyfish are older than dinosaurs?

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.740
&gt;&gt; True.

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:58.040
&gt;&gt; Ali Benjamin: True.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.340
They are older.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.010
Not only than dinosaurs,
they're older than trees,

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:03.270
they're older than seeds,
they're older than bony fish.

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:07.410
They are older than just about
any animal that you can think

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:08.710
of that you have ever seen.

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:10.580
Not single-celled life.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:15.230
They are at least 500 million
years old, and you can basically,

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:19.230 position:56%
they are in more or less the same
form they were when they originated.

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:20.850
All right.

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:22.220
True or false?

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.400
Jellyfish sting with the
pressure of a bullet?

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.700
&gt;&gt; True.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.250
&gt;&gt; Ali Benjamin: It's true.

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:31.080 position:56%
So they've got these tiny -- I'm not
going to go into too much details,

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:35.280
here, but you sort of see
these three yellow things?

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.420
They are stinger cells, and
they've got millions and millions

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.200
and millions of stinger cells.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.980
And what happens is they
brush against something,

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:48.160
and in a split second, far faster
than it takes for our brain to sort

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.820
of make our bodies
react to something hot,

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:55.670
in a fraction of a second,
they've got these stinger things

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:59.160
that are coiled like harpoons, and
it releases out and it releases

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.520
with the pressure of a
bullet, millions of them.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.810
And that is why it hurts so badly.

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:05.110
True or false?

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:06.410
You guys, I'm sure know
the answer to this.

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:08.050
Jellyfish have brains.

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:09.350
&gt;&gt; False.

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:10.650
&gt;&gt; Ali Benjamin: False.

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:12.490
They have no brains, no
bones, no blood, no heart.

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:15.120
None of the things that I
always thought of as the things

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.620
that animal have --
that animals have.

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:21.380
By the way, this was once
considered as a title

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:24.630
for "The Thing About Jellyfish."

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:27.390
And then I was told no, it
really shouldn't be that,

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:30.670
because everybody's going to
think it's a book about zombies.

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:33.910
True or false?

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:38.230
Jellyfish are starving other
creatures in the ocean?

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:39.530
&gt;&gt; True.

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:41.020
&gt;&gt; Ali Benjamin: Yeah,
it's true, actually.

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:45.780
They are, with the warming of
the oceans, and the acidification

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:49.220
of the oceans, I'm sure, kids,
you guys probably talk some

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.220
about climate change in
your science classes.

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:53.520
That's real.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.140
So jellyfish seasons are now --

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.550
they like a warm ocean,
for the most part.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:01.220
Their seasons are much longer
now than they used to be.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:04.880
And they are starting
to take the food.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.690
And so they're rising in numbers.

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:09.010
As they're rising in numbers,
they're taking the food

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:11.650
that traditionally
went to other animals.

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:14.240
And they're also eating
the eggs of other fish

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:17.740
that would otherwise have a
chance to rise in numbers.

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:21.200
They're rising in such numbers,
the numbers are swelling so fast

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.990
that there are scientists
out there who believe

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:27.740
that jellyfish will one day
starve whales to extinction,

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:29.800
and penguins to extinction.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.820
That is an actual thing that
people are talking about.

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.120
It's a terrifying fact.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:39.780
It's absolutely terrifying.

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:43.660
Jellyfish blooms causing serious
damage to earth's ecosystem.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.930
That is a jellyfish
bloom right there.

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:48.620
True or false?

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:50.810
You guys probably know
the answer to this.

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:53.920
The bigger the jellyfish,
the more dangerous it is?

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.220
&gt;&gt; False.

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:56.520
&gt;&gt; Ali Benjamin: Yeah,
totally false.

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:57.820
So that's a lion's mane jellyfish.

00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:01.550
It can grow up to eight feet across
the bell, that sort of round part.

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:05.670 position:56%
They have found ones with tentacles
as long as 100 feet that have washed

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:09.200
up on shore, which is
crazy to think about.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.260
Though I often, with kids,
will show this next slide

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.880
and say don't believe everything
you see on the internet.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.100
That is a photoshopped picture.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:19.550
That's real.

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:22.080
That's false.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.980
So size has nothing to do with it.

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.160
It really has to do with
what the venom is inside.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.820
And that, right there, is
the Irukandji jellyfish.

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:32.300
If you look at it, it is
transparent, it lives --

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:36.370
it's only been found off
the shores of Australia.

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:38.490
It causes something
called Irukandji Syndrome,

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:41.870
that in the best case scenario,
causes your blood pressure to rise,

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:45.160
causes excruciating
pain, excruciating pain,

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:49.100
so much that patients, people who
have it, not only are convinced

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.360
that they're going to die,
sometimes they beg doctors

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.910
to just get it over with sooner.

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:55.510
It can cause the brain
to hemorrhage.

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:59.150
It is not as fatal as the box
jellyfish, which is its cousin,

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:01.270
but it's still pretty
darned dangerous.

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:04.420
If you notice, it can -- it's
sort of the size of a thumbnail,

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:06.240
and it's totally transparent.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.970
Would you ever see
that in the water?

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:11.290
No. You never would.

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:12.590
True or false?

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:13.890
Jellyfish can grow younger?

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:17.300
Mixed things here.

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:20.050
Guys, there is a species
of jellyfish,

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:24.530 position:56%
they have dubbed it The Immortal
Jellyfish, that when it is stressed,

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:28.040
when there are stressful
conditions in the ecosystem,

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.450
it can reverse its lifecycle.

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:33.160
They have the -- just real
short, they have this life cycle

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:36.110
where you get a fertilized
egg in the water,

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:37.960
it goes down to the
bottom of the ocean,

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:41.970
it grows as what's called a polyp
tethered to the bottom of the sea.

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:44.190
At a certain point, when
conditions are right,

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:46.060
it releases from the
bottom of the sea,

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:49.850
and it grows up into what we
think of as the adult jellyfish.

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:53.890
When that adult jellyfish
is stressed, it can go back

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:55.710
to being a polyp at
the bottom of the sea.

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:58.350
That is like if I could
suddenly go back --

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:01.210
I find this situation standing
in front of all of you very,

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:06.560 position:56%
very stressful, so suddenly you have
me as a toddler, my nephew's age,

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:09.000
standing in front of you trying
to deliver this presentation.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.300
It really is like that.

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:11.600
It's outstanding.

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.910
It's the only creature
we know that can do it.

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:14.210
Look it up.

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:15.620
The New York Times
has done articles.

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.770
The Immortal Jellyfish.

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:19.660
So here, we've got this creature.

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:21.790
It looks like aliens.

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:23.500
They're mindless like zombies.

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.770
You can trace the history of
life on earth through jellyfish.

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:29.650
They're dangerous as heck.

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:32.620
They're at the forefront
of our changing planet.

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:36.190
And they hold the secret
to immortality.

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:40.880
And I couldn't find a
single book about jellyfish.

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:45.550
So Toni Morrison -- kids, I hope
someday you read Toni Morrison,

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:51.320
not yet, but some day -- once said,
"If there's a book you really want

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:55.460
to read, but it hasn't been written
yet, then you must write it."

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:57.810
I remember sitting there
reading these articles

00:15:57.810 --> 00:15:59.620 position:56%
and thinking why isn't there a book?

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:04.740
And thinking what if I have to
write a book about jellyfish?

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:07.010
And I remember I went
to my mother-in-law's.

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:10.620
I had just finished somebody
else's memoir, and she said,

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:12.070
"What is your next book
going to be about?"

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:14.590
And I scratched my head and I said,

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:17.660
"I think it's going to
be about jellyfish."

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:22.770 position:56%
And she laughed, which, it was okay,
because it did seem really absurd.

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:26.140
I have done a lot of science
writing, but I'm not a scientist,

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:29.560
and I thought who the heck am I
to write a book about jellyfish?

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.360
But I started writing.

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.380
And here we have this book,
"The Thing About Jellyfish."

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:35.680
It came out last year.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.460
I'm going to very quickly
go through the story.

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:39.140
I'm not going to talk
a lot about it.

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:43.420
But the basic plot is there's a
12-year-old girl, Suzy Swanson,

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:46.020
whose best friend has just
drowned while on summer vacation.

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:49.740
Suzy -- Franny, her friend,
was a very, very good swimmer,

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:51.160
and it really confuses her.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:55.510
She's also at the age where, and
this is very much what I remember

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:59.280
about being that age,
where you suddenly realize

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.740
that not every story
gets a happy ending.

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:06.050
And sometimes really bad
things happen, and it stinks

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:09.020
and somehow you have
to learn with it.

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:12.050
And I remember I had this cognitive
dissonance when I was that age

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:15.640
and I was thinking,
like, how can that be?

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.200
Somebody's got to make this right.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.440
It can't just end like this.

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:24.700 position:56%
So she, in her grief, and I should
say that their friendship had broken

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:30.340 position:56%
up in a very dramatic way before her
friend passed away, and she has not

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:32.220
yet had a chance to make it right.

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.030
And then she finds out
that her friend died,

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:38.880
and she is just absolutely
wrecked with guilt and with grief.

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.310
And she stops speaking.

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:41.900
She doesn't talk to
anyone in her life,

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:43.400
not her parents, not her teachers.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:46.360
This is sort of, almost
like an internal protest

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.620
to the world being this way.

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:53.740 position:56%
And one day she goes to the aquarium
on a school trip and she wanders,

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.550
she goes looking for
the quietest room

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:58.840
in the aquarium while she's there,
and it's the jellyfish exhibit.

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:03.530
The story of how the book begins
is actually the same story --

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:06.770
or is actually the same story
that unfolds as the book begins.

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:08.640
And she looks at these jellyfish,

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:12.480
and she reads about the Irukandji
jellyfish, and she decides

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.400
that actually her friend was
killed by an Irukandji jellyfish,

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.460
which are maybe starting to
migrate around the world.

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:19.860
And she is going to prove it.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:23.110
She is going to do whatever
it takes to prove it.

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:25.240
And she decides she's going
to enlist help from people.

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:27.690
There are real -- there's a
lot of non-fiction that's woven

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:28.990
into this book, and one

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:32.610
of the non-fiction parts is she
begins researching people who know

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:34.530
about jellyfish, people
who have experience

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:37.260
with jellyfish who
maybe can help her.

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.070
The one on the left is Diana Nyad.

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:41.490
You guys know who Diana
Nyad is, right?

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:43.720
Sometimes kids don't
know who Diana Nyad is.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:48.970 position:56%
She tried for many decades, five
times, to swim from Cuba to Florida,

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:51.880
and a number of those
times had to stop

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.840
because she was stung
so badly by jellyfish.

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:58.020
The jellyfish in the middle is a
recently-discovered jellyfish by --

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:02.200
it was discovered by a
scientist/haiku poet.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.230
It's called the Paper Lantern
Jellyfish, because it can sort

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:08.270
of crumple up and it sort of
looks almost like a paper lantern.

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:10.780
And then the guy on the
right is named Jamie Seymour.

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:12.150
He is a toxicologist.

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:13.450
He works in Australia.

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:15.230
That's him holding an
Irukandji jellyfish.

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:19.940
He is the world's foremost
researcher of Irukandji jellyfish.

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:23.070
And she looks at him and
she's like, that's the guy.

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:25.400
That's the guy who's
going to help me out.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.020
But he's in Australia.

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:28.860
She's all the way in Massachusetts.

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:31.520
So a big question in this book,
sort of the heart of the book,

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.310
is how far will she go

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:36.620
to make things right on
behalf of her friend?

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:40.000
Along the way she discovers
some pretty startling things.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.510
One is that each of us, everybody,
all of you sitting out there,

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:47.470
you've got at least 60,000
miles of blood vessels going

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:50.520
through your body, which is enough,
if you line them up end to end,

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:53.140
to circle the world
two and a half times.

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:57.090
Like, that's in you right now.

00:19:57.090 --> 00:20:01.040
Every one of you sitting out there
probably has at least two billion

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.080
of Shakespeare's atoms, atoms

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:06.820
that were once inside William
Shakespeare, inside of you.

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:09.620
I will say, when you write a book
that has a lot of non-fiction,

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:12.960
there's a lot of fact
checking that goes on.

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.530
This was one that there was
a lot of discussion about.

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:19.940
Other people have said
200 billion atoms.

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:24.800
We did some really interesting
calculations to say, like, okay,

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:28.560
but he lived on another continent
and we -- I mean, it was --

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.900
we sort of worked to figure
out what the right number --

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:33.570
that's probably a conservative
estimate.

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:36.960
And then the very simple
fact that all of us,

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:40.160
everything in you right
now is crafted from stars

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:43.180
that existed at the dawn of time.

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:46.770
Which I -- when I think about that,
it is a really mind-blowing fact.

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:49.260
This is one of the things
she discovers as she's sort

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:53.070
of doing her research and trying
to make science work for her.

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:55.960
She understands, she begins to
understand that science isn't

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:59.270
about formulas from a textbook.

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:02.290
Science is about a
world that's around us

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:04.850
that is actually astonishing.

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:11.720
So, I'm writing this book
that part of me feels

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.520
like I have no business to write.

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:17.740
I don't know at the beginning if
I'm writing fiction or non-fiction.

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:20.000
Now it's easy for me to
tell you what the story is.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.420
I have to tell you when I
started writing about jellyfish,

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:24.920
I thought I was writing
a non-fiction book.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:30.050
But I didn't -- yeah, fiction,
non-fiction, I did not,

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:36.590
as I was writing, anytime I
tried to write only non-fiction,

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:41.960
it did not capture the wonder that
I felt when I really looked at it.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:45.030
It didn't capture what
I felt was astonishing.

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:51.490
It didn't feel, for me, on
paper the way I felt inside

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:52.830
when I thought about writing it.

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:56.110
So after a while, I remembered,
like, having this moment

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:58.830
where I was like, I think
it's a fictional book

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:01.340
where I can explore these
through a character.

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:03.580
I also didn't know if I
was writing for adults,

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:05.460
or if I was writing for kids.

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:07.590
It's a 12-year-old main character.

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:09.130
Some of the themes are pretty dark.

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:13.050
I went back and forth, and then
finally I sent it off to my agent,

00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:15.160
and she was like, "You
are writing for kids.

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.460
Finish this."

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:21.090 position:56%
But it was a lot -- it was very --
I just didn't know what I was doing.

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:23.270
I was feeling my way through
right from the beginning.

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:27.780
I wrote a million, I
mean, probably 14 drafts.

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:30.630
Ernest Hemingway said the first
draft of anything is crud.

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:32.080
The word he used was not crud.

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:35.750
I can't say the word that he used.

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:37.290
But he's right.

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:41.850
Kids, when you're in school, do
you ever have to write something

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:46.660
for your teachers where they
look at it, you turn it in,

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:50.380
your teacher looks at it, grades
it, and then hands it back to you

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:53.040
and says, okay, do another draft.

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:56.020
Yeah. And do you love it
when the teacher does that?

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:57.750
No! And neither did I.

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:03.410
But I have to say, there's a
reason that your teacher does that,

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:07.050
and that's because someday
you are going to want

00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:09.500
to say something to the world.

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:10.800
I don't know what it is.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.490
My guess is it's probably not
going to be about jellyfish,

00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:15.240
but it's going to be something.

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:20.670
I don't know any adult who doesn't
feel something really deeply

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:23.700
and personally and they want
to represent it to the world.

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:27.110
And you often don't get
it right the first time,

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:29.180
or the second time,
or the third time.

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:31.180
And the reason your
teacher makes you do that,

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:34.640
is because they want you to be
in a habit, when you are ready

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:38.650
to take your message to the
world, to really know yourself

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:40.420
when it's right or
when it's not right.

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:44.010
I probably -- I did a number of
drafts before we even showed it

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:46.150
to publishers, and then we went

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:48.230
through several more
drafts afterwards.

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:54.030
And -- this is interesting
-- at a certain point,

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:55.620
they take the book away from you.

00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:57.980
I don't know that I ever
felt like it was done,

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:00.350
but it had to go to press.

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:03.500
So people ask me, like, how
did you know when it was done,

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.240
and the answer is I didn't.

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:07.630
I just no longer had a
chance to work on it.

00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:11.300
And it was actually for
months after it went to press,

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:13.690
I would be like at the
gym, and I would be running

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:17.060
and I would think of, like,
just the perfect line that one

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:19.700
of the characters could
say at a perfect moment,

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:22.210
and I'd be like, "That's so good!"

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:24.140
and I don't know what
to do with it anymore.

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:27.130
That was interesting,
but it was worth it.

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:30.030
It was a National Book
Award finalist last year.

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:35.380 position:56%
I usually show this with a slide
contrasted to me when I was a child,

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:40.220
because when I was a child, I was
this really, kind of, weird --

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:42.250
I had these hippie, hippie parents.

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:47.020
I had, you know, just crazy, messy
braids, and these dirty shirts,

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:52.080
and food smeared all over my face,
and I think about who I was then,

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:55.500
and I think about kids who
are out there who maybe feel

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:57.950
like they don't fit in,
and I want to be like, no,

00:24:57.950 --> 00:24:59.720
no, no, I was such a mess.

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.240
It all began with curiosity.

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:03.860
A nuclear physicist said those

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:06.730
who do not stop asking silly
questions become scientists.

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:09.840
I want to go back to that theme
of curiosity, and asking questions

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:12.290
and not being embarrassed
to ask questions.

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:14.780
I would just add -- or
they become writers.

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:20.450
And kids, if you ever do feel
self-conscious about things

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:23.410
that you're interested
in, maybe you feel weird

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:25.930
because you're the only one who's
interested in it, and it's kind of,

00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:27.730
like, it doesn't feel right.

00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:32.490
What I would say is just trust
it, and if you move to that thing

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:34.570
that you're interested in, and
then from there you're going

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:36.780
to see something else that you're
interested in, and then from there,

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:38.330
you're going to see something else.

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:42.080
What you will find over time,
and you can't see it yet from

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:45.640
where you are, is that
it becomes a life path.

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:47.410
And the reason you're
interested in these things

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:50.820
and nobody else is interested in
them, is because it's your path,

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:53.340
and it's not supposed
to be their path.

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:54.650
So we've got about five minutes.

00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:58.370
I'm happy to take questions on
the writing process, on jellyfish,

00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:00.970
on anything at all, really.

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:09.040
Yeah?

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:12.330
Has anyone I ever know -- has
anyone I've ever known been stung

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:13.630
by a jellyfish?

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:17.630
Yes, and I often will ask
people, and I'll ask this group.

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:21.840
Does anybody here know anybody
who's been stung by a jellyfish?

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.790
Yeah. Has anybody here
been stung by a jellyfish?

00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:26.230
There are a lot of hands.

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:29.240
Guys, there are 150 million stings

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:32.390
that we know about
every single year.

00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:37.900
That adds up to 23 every five
seconds, which means that just

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:39.890
since I've been talking,
it's thousands

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:42.340
and thousands and thousands
of stings.

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:43.960
Yeah?

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:47.590
&gt;&gt; In your research on
jellyfish, did you --

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:49.870
I remember you saying that they
are having a massive impact

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:51.170
on ecosystems.

00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:52.470
&gt;&gt; Ali Benjamin: Yeah.

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:55.340
&gt;&gt; Did you find any, like, I guess
like natural, like a push-back

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:56.830
against that sheer number?

00:26:56.830 --> 00:27:00.070
Like are they reaching a
carrying capacity that, you know,

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:03.100
they just eat too much food that
some die off, or is it just --

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:04.400 position:56%
are they different to other species.

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.250
&gt;&gt; Ali Benjamin: That's a
good -- that's a very good --

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:09.740
the question is did
I find any push-back,

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:11.750
like where the system is
sort of righting itself.

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:13.050
Is that what you mean?

00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:15.770
Like the ecosystem is sort of
finding ways of righting itself?

00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:17.070
I did not.

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:19.440
I don't know that that's
not happening,

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:21.130
but that's not something
I've seen talked about.

00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:24.610
And it's also worth saying at this
point there is actually now --

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:26.180
there wasn't when I
started writing this --

00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:29.370
a really great adult
non-fiction book called "Stung."

00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:30.670
It's by Lisa Ann Gershwin.

00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:31.970
She's a scientist.

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:33.270
It's sort of the book
that I was, like, "Well,

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:35.140
I don't have any business
writing that book."

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:36.440
She wrote it.

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.500
It's fantastic, and
that's a very good place

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:39.800
to go for more information.

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:42.100
Yeah?

00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:52.230
So that's a similar question.

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:54.700
Do jellyfish have any
natural enemies?

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:56.450
Yes, I mean, there are
creatures who eat them.

00:27:56.450 --> 00:28:00.770
Sea turtles eat them, and there's
a lot of talk about all the plastic

00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:04.030
in the oceans, and it's
because a plastic bag when it's

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:07.770
in the ocean can look, the way
it moves, a lot like a jellyfish,

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:09.180
and so there are all
these horrible stories

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:11.850
of sea turtles swallowing
plastic bags.

00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:14.220
The plastic in the ocean
issue is a really huge --

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:16.130
I touch upon it a little
in the book.

00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:22.030
But I don't know that it's
slowing the population down.

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:23.790
I don't know that's it's
not, but that's not something

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:25.870
that I've seen written
about recently.

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:27.170
Yeah?

00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:28.820
&gt;&gt; Have you ever been
stung by a jellyfish?

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:30.480
&gt;&gt; Ali Benjamin: Have I ever
been stung by a jellyfish?

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.910
No, I -- stung is a strong word.

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:34.700
So there was that picture
of me holding jellyfish.

00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:36.620
I want to say, if you
don't know what kind

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:39.440
of jellyfish you're dealing
with, don't pick them up.

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:42.380
There's one that I had
picked up that I --

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:48.580 position:56%
it made my hand a little numb, but
I didn't consider that a real sting.

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:53.630 position:56%
No, I'm a big baby, and I am a giant
frady cat, and when I see jellyfish,

00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:57.060
I kind of run away if I
don't know what kind it is.

00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:58.360
Yeah?

00:28:58.360 --> 00:28:59.660
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] characters?

00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:02.040
&gt;&gt; Ali Benjamin: Oh, how did
I come up with the characters?

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.880
That's such a good question.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:09.690
I would say characters are a little
bit like people emerging from fog,

00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:13.640
and at the beginning, all you see
is this vague outline of them,

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:16.720 position:56%
and then the more you write, the
more it's like they're moving to you

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:20.080
from the fog, and you get
to see specific features.

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:22.950
Yeah. And they just kind of, over
time, they just kind of come.

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:24.250
Yeah.

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:26.880
&gt;&gt; What are you working on now?

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.180
&gt;&gt; Ali Benjamin: What
am I working on now?

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:30.430
That is a really great question.

00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:38.040
I am working on another novel that
weaves in exploration and violence

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:41.550
in our society, but
it's a book for kids.

00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:45.170
And so I've been working really
hard on trying to get the notion

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:48.780
of sort of, I'm particularly
interested in polar explorers,

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:54.460
and sort of violence, and what
are our aspirations as a species

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:59.610 position:56%
versus where do we go small and
where does fear start to control us.

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:00.910
Yeah.

00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:03.160 position:56%
&gt;&gt; As a middle school librarian, the
guidance counselors often come to me

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.720
when we have students
that have issues

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:07.140
through book therapy
and book bibliotherapy.

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:08.440
&gt;&gt; Ali Benjamin: Yeah.

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:09.740
&gt;&gt; Your book is often
recommended now,

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:12.520
with working with middle
schoolers, that dissonance

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:15.000
of feeling no right and
wrong at this point.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.210
They're still working on learning
what gray in their lives mean.

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:21.520 position:56%
That your book is what's often
recommended to help students process

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:22.820
through that, so thank you.

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:24.120
&gt;&gt; Ali Benjamin: Thank you.

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:25.420
Thank you.

00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:26.720
Yeah?

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:29.350
&gt;&gt; Hi. We have a joke
for you about jellyfish.

00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:30.650
&gt;&gt; Ali Benjamin: Can
you all hear that?

00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:31.950
That they have a joke
about jellyfish?

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:35.400
&gt;&gt; Yeah. What do jellyfish
get stressed about?

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:37.180
&gt;&gt; Ali Benjamin: What do
jellyfish get stressed about?

00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:38.480
I don't know.

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.780
&gt;&gt; The current events.

00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:41.240 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ali Benjamin: The current events!

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:43.390
[ Applause ]

00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:45.470
Oh, okay, and she's waving a sign

00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:47.790
that says wrap up,
over allotted time.

00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:51.180
I will be here for a few minutes
if anybody wants to ask me.

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:52.480
Yeah.

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:53.780
&gt;&gt; I just have a question
about children and grief,

00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:58.210
and I'd like to know what you
learned about children and grief.

00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:00.310
Oh, okay, I'll end on this,
and then we'll go outside.

00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:01.610
Children and grief.

00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:03.290
What did I learn about
children and grief?

00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:09.020
I'm often asked for answers
about children and grief,

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:11.580
and how children should
process grief and I --

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:13.630
my answer is always I don't know.

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:16.730 position:56%
Because I feel like children are
struggling with the very same things

00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:19.810
that we adults are struggling
with, like how could this happen,

00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:22.310
this isn't fair, this
isn't what I wanted,

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:26.930
particularly when something happens
to somebody who was good or young.

00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:31.830
And I feel like this book, in some
ways, was my own way of wrestling

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:38.030
with it, and saying I don't know,
all I know is eventually you go on.

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:41.480
I mean, it's such a
useless answer in some ways,

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:44.910
but it's the most honest
answer I can give to anyone.

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:49.650 position:56%
And I'm getting -- I'm not going to
call them evil eye, but I would love

00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:51.450
to hear your questions,
but I think they need

00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:53.090
to set up for the next speaker.

00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:55.390
Okay, thank you.

00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:00.350

of The Library of Congress.
