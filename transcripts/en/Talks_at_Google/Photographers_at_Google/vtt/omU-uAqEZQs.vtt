BRIAN MATIASH: Thank you very
much everyone for joining us

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.950
here today.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:06.750
My name is Brian Matiash.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.480
I am the community manager
for Google+ Photos.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.880
And I'm actually really excited
when I found out that

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.290
Jaime was coming.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.100
I first kind of became aware of
Jaime shortly after Google+

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.290
launched about two years ago.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.820
We just celebrated our
two-year anniversary.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.400
And as you can kind of see, it's
not surprising why anyone

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.180
would really kind of want
to follow Jaime's work.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.760
The photography that Jaime
shares is beautiful obviously.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.950
But it's also a really
interesting combination of

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.940
elegance and provocativeness.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.770
And I find that to be
something that you

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:49.670
don't see too often.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.070
There's a really creative
methodology here.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.010
And as I got to know Jaime
better through Hangouts that

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.250
we've been on together over the
past few years and also

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.150
even just at dinner, one of
the things that strikes me

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.930
most about Jaime, if I had to
summarize it, it wouldn't be

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:04.800
actually photographer.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.580
It would be artist.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.330
And that's because Jaime's
not just a photographer.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.920
In fact, I think Jaime told me
that music is the first and

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.900
foremost

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.260
Jaime composes his own music.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.640
And it's really awesome.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.580
A lot of times when you see
these videos that he puts out,

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.070
his music is in the
background.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.770
But he's also a designer.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.160
And if you do seek out these
kinds of videos, these

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.330
time-lapse videos of his
editing, you'll see that

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.130
musician, obviously
photographer, but also kind of

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.560
like a stylistic editor.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.660
These are words that kind
of come to mind.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.570
He is a mad scientist
with Photoshop.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.610
So with that, I want
to introduce my

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.390
friend Jaime to present.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:47.940
So let's give him a little bit
of a round of applause.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.830
JAIME IBARRA: I was going to
seamlessly segue into this

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.130
video I was going to
show you guys.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.760
I don't know how to gracefully
get into it.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.050
It's like, could I
just hit play?

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.230
I think it gives a brief
overview of kind of what I do.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.076
So does anybody want
to watch a video?

00:02:05.076 --> 00:02:06.150
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.850
JAIME IBARRA: I don't normally
drive a Mac so

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.510
bear with me here.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.680
Since we're not really listening
to the audio on

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.120
there, this is just a brief
kind of overview.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.140
Basically what I do, I start
with the photo obviously.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.840
And then, go from there.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.530
I'm kind of producing
my own stock.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.950
A lot of times I'm shooting
things that are going to be

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.710
elements in a photo.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.760
I do a lot of compositing.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.330
We don't really see any of that
in this particular photo.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.030
Everything was pretty
much in place.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.070
If anything, we just removed
a bunch of stuff.

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.050
The only thing I added was--

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.930
well, you see it, this hair.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.990
And it was a hot day.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.860
What was it?

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.700
It was 104 outside that day, not
counting whatever heat was

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.202
radiating off that asphalt.

00:03:05.202 --> 00:03:06.360
And it was cooking.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.120
So I think if your head did look
good earlier that day, it

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.940
certainly stopped
at that point.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.510
So no worries.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.080
I just painted some in.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.660
So that's about all I can
about that really.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:32.200
And I think I'd be dead in the
water without Photoshop and

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.790
without my post-production
stuff.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.890
And I'm OK with that.

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.290
My background is that of
a graphic designer.

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.440
I was doing that for years
and years and years.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.210
I remember Photoshop
before there was

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.000
such a thing as layers.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.650
And that gives you an idea
about how far back that

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.160
Photoshop and I go.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.530
We're old friends,
mostly friends.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.170
And that's just a
little overview.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.170
And I was going to talk
about this photo,

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.015
but you saw the video.

00:04:05.015 --> 00:04:09.020
So we started with this--

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.480
and delay.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.700
What are we doing?

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.430
Let me go to just
the next one.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.660
And what I did today was I
really had a hard time trying

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.750
to figure out what I wanted
to talk about exactly.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.970
One thing that people that know
me know all too well, is

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.450
I am the most hopelessly and
unrepentantly right-brained

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.230
person you'll likely
ever meet.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.840
My brain wanders all the time.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.330
I lack the ability to think
in a procedural

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.490
way most of the time.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.740
But although sometimes I beat
myself up about that, I think

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.100
if I weren't that way,
I don't think my work

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.880
would be what it is.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.720
And that goes with
the photography.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.670
It goes with music.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:50.920
It goes with anything I do.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.670
I'm kind of a stream of
consciousness kind of guy.

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.260
Just whatever comes in, as it
comes in, I just sort of take

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.845
it and let it become whatever
it is going to become.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.180
And as far as photography goes,
I'm definitely not a

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.580
technician at all.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.730
I own one camera.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.830
I own one lens for
that camera.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.210
And I'm totally OK with that.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.010
Like that lens is my eye and
I've gotten used to seeing how

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.620
I see things through it.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:23.780
And this photo right here
actually goes back to probably

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.910
a time when I first
started out.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.480
And I don't know if anybody
knows who the person

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.320
in this photo is.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.020
But she is--

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.560
AUDIENCE: Mata Hari.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.147
JAIME IBARRA: What's that?

00:05:31.147 --> 00:05:32.310
AUDIENCE: Mata Hari?

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.900
JAIME IBARRA: Well, Mata Hari
had a lot of influence.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:35.870
This is Rachel Brice.

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.700
Rachel Brice is responsible
for what is now known as

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:44.060
'tribal belly dance." And if you
see belly dancers nowadays

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.685
that dress like this, they're
basically copying what Rachel

00:05:47.685 --> 00:05:49.910
Brice invented.

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:54.080
And it was really cool that I
got to shoot with her for

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.770
about three minutes in her
dressing room at a show.

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.890
She got wind that I was
in the crowd and

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.060
invited me back there.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.030
And you're looking at the end
result of that shoot.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:11.930
But to show you the before,
it's not nearly as cool.

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.390
This is her in her
dressing room.

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.505
I shot this with
my Canon 300D.

00:06:18.505 --> 00:06:20.490
That's the original
Digital Rebel.

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.230
My 6.1 megapixels of awesome.

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:28.180
And there was a little plastic
kit lens that came with it.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.495
I really didn't know what
I was doing at the time.

00:06:30.495 --> 00:06:33.890
The only light in that room is
just the fluorescent ceiling

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:35.550
lights and that was all.

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.760
And I think now I wouldn't have
shot this photo the way

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.500
that I shot it here.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.120
But this is back in--

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.925
I literally didn't really
know what I was doing.

00:06:44.925 --> 00:06:49.810
But you can see how much the
post-production came in and

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.600
saved the day with this one.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.770
So that's Rachel Brice.

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.400
That was my first.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.760
The first photo shoot that I
did, I actually bragged about.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.170
There is people that would kill
to get a shoot with her.

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:07.960
And I don't know how
I managed to do it.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.820
But that's Rachel Brice.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:15.640
That was my first moderate
success story.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:20.034
Let me talk a little bit
about this one this.

00:07:20.034 --> 00:07:23.830
This is my lovely fiance, who
is sitting right in front of

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.360
me, next to Michael Bonocore.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.412
Lucky, lucky you, you're
closer than I am.

00:07:29.412 --> 00:07:30.320
MICHAEL BONOCORE:
And your camera.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:30.990
JAIME IBARRA: And my camera.

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.700
And this Shantia.

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.920
She's an amazing, amazing,
amazing model.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:44.620
And we oftentimes will approach
designers who just

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:48.300
make interesting clothes or make
interesting accessories.

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:51.325
And we found a lady--

00:07:51.325 --> 00:07:51.810
do you know her name?

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:52.650
I forget her name.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:53.400
SHANTIA VENEY: Kelly Emporium.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:57.280
JAIME IBARRA: Kelly Emporium,
who agreed to let us

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.710
photograph the headdress
that she made.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:02.520
It's actually made of
leather, was it?

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.430
SHANTIA VENEY: Un-huh.

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:06.360
JAIME IBARRA: And we
had a fun with it.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.420
But this is the final image.

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:13.300
What the actual headdress looks
like when we started was

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.890
simply that.

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:19.100
And it's pretty cool
on its own.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:25.840
But you can see the amount of
post-production that was done.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:31.590
The background was a painting
that a pretty amazing artist

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:35.120
in Germany that I know-- and
agreed to allow me to use that

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.980
as the background
for the photo.

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:41.090
And then the make-up
is kind of styled.

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:44.210
That's an example of one
breeze stirs another.

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:47.330
And I think had you not done
your make-up that way, I don't

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:48.650
think I would have done
that background.

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:51.690
The background came as a result
of you having done your

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:56.620
make-up that way, with the blue
fading up into the black.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:00.920
And then the gold just as
a yellow meets blue.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.610
It's just a complementary color
path that I just think

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:07.600
worked really well
with that photo.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:13.590
And there's a nice example.

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:15.320
I don't know how long it
took me to do that.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.350
So I spent a good two days
trying to figure out how to

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:19.435
extend the--

00:09:19.435 --> 00:09:22.530
I don't know what you call them,
tendricles, the things

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:23.740
that are coming out
behind the mask.

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:25.730
But once I figured it
out, they ended up

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:29.000
looking pretty good.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.430
This one, I think this is the
first time I was ever chased

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:39.130
out of a location by
a security guard.

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:43.460
I was walking through the--
there's sort of an

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:44.210
underground.

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:47.345
There's a driveway that went
through Lloyd Center Mall up

00:09:47.345 --> 00:09:48.420
in Portland, Oregon.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:54.370
And we walked through there
because I knew that as you're

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:57.330
driving into the parking lot
properly, like above the

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:01.450
ground, there was drain grates
that I was told by a friend of

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:04.360
mine that yeah, underneath those
drain grates is this

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.620
deck where you can drive
through to the

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:06.560
other side of the mall.

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.270
So we just walked
through there.

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:12.070
And I was really hoping that the
light would be coming in

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:14.550
nicely through the drain grates,
which once you're down

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:16.470
below, they're above
your head.

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:20.380
So we were walking through in
this dress that we got for $12

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:21.630
at the Salvation Army.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:27.220
She's like 6 foot
3, this model.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:29.030
It's a truly, truly tall lady.

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:31.600
And that dress was hanging off
of her, which looked amazing

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.840
the way it was just
extra poofy.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.720
So we decided just to
walk through and

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.560
try to get some shots.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:39.960
And we were chased
out by the Segway

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.120
security police that day.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.490
And I tried not to laugh at
them when they, [BUZZING],

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:45.580
they buzzed up.

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:49.810
But I figured we had maybe a
minute at most to get the shot

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:52.300
before they were going to come
chase us out of there.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:53.650
And that's what we got.

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:57.410
And she's not really
levitating.

00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:01.900
It's just an effort to just make
something a little more

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.245
interesting than it was.

00:11:03.245 --> 00:11:05.800
I can show you the before.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.240
So this is the actual reality
of that shot.

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:14.620
Pretty cool, I guess.

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:18.640
I just thought it would be more
interesting if we had her

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.770
levitating.

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:22.000
Obviously, done in
post-production.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:30.155
And where I got the idea for
these kind of tendrily things,

00:11:30.155 --> 00:11:33.240
have you ever been to a Hobby
Lobby or a Michael's, is they

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.700
have this section were all the
dried floral arrangement

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:36.530
products are.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:39.360
And these were just some dried,
twiggy, stick things

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.630
that we were going to
use for a different

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:41.690
shoot later that month.

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:45.080
And when we got them,
I photographed them.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.540
I was holding those twigs out
at arm's length and just

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.750
photographed them, never really
thinking what am I

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:52.270
going to use those for.

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:52.940
I shot them.

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:53.970
And I'm glad I did.

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:59.800
Because I ended pulling those as
a component into this photo

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:00.500
just because.

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:03.120
It's kind of weird,
but why not?

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.850
And then the orange stripe
running through the wall was

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:10.670
just more complementary colors
that worked, which I thought

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:12.720
it made it a little
more interesting.

00:12:15.288 --> 00:12:19.560
I have sort of a guide built
into my brain with colors.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:24.080
I have a condition that's
known as synaesthesia.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:27.940
And I don't know if anyone
here knows what this is.

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:30.640
For those of you who do not,
technically it's a

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:34.190
neurological condition in which
there is a wire crossed

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:36.080
between two of your senses.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.840
And some people with
synaesthesia will have the

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:42.680
ability to say smell numbers,
which I can't even imagine

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:43.310
that happening.

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:48.000
But some people can
taste sounds.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.160
In me, I have a color and
sound association.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:57.700
In which one color, like I say
we had orange, and if that

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:02.340
orange touches a blue, basically
a musical tone or a

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:03.310
note is produced.

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:06.110
And I will hear that note.

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:09.420
One color, sitting by itself,
doesn't produce any--

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:13.600
it's the interaction of that
color with another color.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.570
So when I'm editing photos and
I'm coming up with a color

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:20.100
palette or whatever, I'm
really forming a

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.770
chord within the photo.

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:23.300
We have a chord.

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:26.400
Again, if you don't play music,
we've all sat down at a

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.540
keyboard at some point
in your life.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:31.170
And if you play one note,
well that's just a note.

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:32.300
And if you play two
notes, well now

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.700
you've got an interval.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:37.510
If you play three, now you've
got a chord going on.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:40.800
And depending on which three
notes you've hit, there's

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.090
going to be a mood
to that chord.

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:46.160
Like if it's a minor chord,
it's going sound saddish.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.310
And if it's a major chord, it's
going to sound happy.

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:52.640
And in my mind, this
is how colors are.

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:58.110
So when I come up with a color
palette for a photo, it has to

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:01.650
sound harmonious in my head.

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:04.130
I can't control what
the notes are.

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:06.840
But I can control what colors
I use to make the

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:09.390
chord that I want.

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:12.790
That's my way of perceiving
color.

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:14.780
It's been this way as long
as I can remember.

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:17.480
I actually wasn't diagnosed with
synaesthesia until I was

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.020
about 30 years old.

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:21.490
So just last year, basically.

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:23.570
I'll be 44 in a few
weeks actually.

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:34.480
This photo actually was a
compositing experiment.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:41.310
And talking about stockpiling
elements to composite with

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:47.370
over the years, when I moved
from there Portland, Oregon to

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:49.030
Austin, Texas, which is
where I'm currently

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:51.290
based, I had the ride--

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.110
I call it trial by Greyhound.

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:56.060
It was a 60-some hour ride
on a Greyhound bus.

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:57.790
Which if anyone has ever ridden
a Greyhound bus, it's

00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:59.920
not a lot of fun.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.640
But I didn't really have
anything to do other than to

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:03.340
take photos.

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:04.490
And what are you going
to take photos of?

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:07.420
I just took photos out the
window of the bus pretty much

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:09.490
the whole journey,
well as long as

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:11.460
the sun was out anyway.

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:14.660
And those trees as you see in
this photo, that's just one of

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:18.150
the bazillion photos I took
while we're going down the

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:20.660
road in the Greyhound.

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.540
The whole time taking the
photos, like well, I'm never

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:23.730
going to use these
for anything.

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:24.540
I'm never going to use these.

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:25.600
What am I going to
use them for?

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:29.500
Something told me to take the
photos, so I just took them.

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:32.920
The same thing with the birds
you see in this photo.

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.480
Those are two completely
separate photos.

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:38.090
And if you remember the tendrily
things in the photo

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:40.775
with the girl that was floating,
the ones from Hobby

00:15:40.775 --> 00:15:44.306
Lobby, we see those
here again.

00:15:44.306 --> 00:15:46.520
I sort of brought those
in as another element.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.830
So there's really, there's
four different

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:50.030
photos at work here.

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:52.180
There's the tendrils, and then
there's the birds, and then

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:54.750
there are the trees,
and then the model.

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:58.110
And all I did was just-- well,
I can actually show you the

00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:01.700
components of this photo.

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:06.190
Sometimes there's no really
intent necessarily other than

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:08.420
I just want to do some
because it's weird.

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:10.790
And I felt this was weird.

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:11.750
There's no rules.

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:15.010
There's no wrong or right
way to go about this.

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:17.080
That's the photo of the model.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.210
And I just had her just jump.

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:22.470
She boinged about 8, 9
inches off the carpet

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:23.410
and that was it.

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:24.900
And the light is only the--

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:29.630
this is my cheap little
Ikea floor lantern.

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:30.900
I don't want to do a commercial
for Ikea.

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:34.360
But all those weird names of
the products at Ikea-- this

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.600
one was called Orgel Vreten.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:37.550
I'm pronouncing it badly.

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:40.580
I was later told by someone
that knew what that really

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:42.420
meant, it turns out it's not
even a Swedish thing.

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:44.800
I think it was someone
from Norway.

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:49.250
He said it was Organ Eater is
the name of that lamp, the

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:50.440
Organ Eater.

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:51.620
I said organ like--

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:53.820
no, organ like your insides.

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:55.650
I was like I didn't know that.

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:58.630
So this her lit up by the organ

00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:00.520
eater lamp, how charming.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:07.319
And there's the photo of the
trees obviously, out the bus.

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:11.910
And then the tendrily thing
is from the Hobby Lobby.

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:14.995
And all those things combined
equal this.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:22.410
Like I said, there's not always
an intent or a message.

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:24.359
I was just doing it.

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:26.609
It just looked cool to me.

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:27.810
It's an experiment.

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:31.870
Most of what I do is kind of
an experiment I think.

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:34.070
And this one.

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:37.890
This was the first time ever
worked with someone that does

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:39.410
body painting.

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:47.240
And it was about 12 or 13 hours
just to do the body

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.530
paint you see in this.

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:52.140
And what did I do during
those 12 and 13 hours?

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.800
I was in charge of snack
acquisition.

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:56.365
I was making tea.

00:17:56.365 --> 00:17:57.920
I was making sure everybody
had music

00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:58.720
they were happy with.

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.830
It was kind of a boring day.

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:04.350
And when it came down do it,
the time I spent actually

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:08.000
shooting was maybe 30
minutes, maybe.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.760
But I just kind of sat
on these photos

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:13.800
for the longest time.

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:17.850
I was like-- this photo, the
final image wasn't produced

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:20.430
for-- it took about five or six
months before I actually

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:21.660
had an idea.

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:25.890
I think a lot of times what I'll
do is shoot, knowing that

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:28.790
the shoot itself is just
part of the process.

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:33.930
So I think a lot of times, in
my weird mind anyway, the

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:34.700
photos have to--

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:36.490
I have to kind of live with
them for a while.

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:38.150
They have to sort of incubate.

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:40.530
And the more I go back, and I'll
look at those photos and

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:42.960
just start getting more of an
idea about maybe what I want

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.560
to do with them.

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.790
Just looking at them the first
time doesn't necessarily give

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:48.460
me an idea.

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:51.570
And you know, there's photos
you and I have done that

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:54.960
months have rolled by where
I didn't even touch them.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:55.810
They weren't ready yet.

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:57.910
They're still in the cooker.

00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:01.100
And that's just kind
of what happens.

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.960
And Shantia is also
a photographer.

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:07.210
And she and I will work
with models that

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:08.700
come through our area.

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:12.100
And you always tell them well,
I'm going to take photos of

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:14.330
you so that you'll have some
instantly, so that you don't

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:16.970
have to get angry waiting
on photos.

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:19.370
Because it's going to take quite
a while for you to get

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:22.330
the photos that he
took of you.

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:23.540
I wish it wasn't that way.

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:26.220
But my brain just takes
a while to let

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:28.800
these things incubate.

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.760
And this is a fine example
of one of those.

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:34.770
That's the final image.

00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:38.940
The before, not an stunning.

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:42.560
That's the living room at the
house, up against the

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:43.210
thermostat.

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:45.475
That's the controller for the
ceiling fan on the wall.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.860
There's our magic
world in there.

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:51.820
And I think there's a laundry
bin, yeah, back

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:53.360
in the doorway there.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:56.880
But just a nice, clean
background.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.420
And I know I can drop
something that

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:01.640
I want later on.

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:07.690
She just had this kind of a
goddess look about her.

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:10.690
I tried all kinds of different
backgrounds and stuff.

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:12.800
In the end, just having
a wall-- usually

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.610
I'll change the wall.

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:16.610
That just seemed
inappropriate.

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:19.480
So I just figured, hey,
let's go with nature.

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.230
And this is what I
ended up with.

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:29.720
Speaking of my lovely, lovely
lady, this is a shot we took.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:33.791
This was one of the first
shoots we really did.

00:20:33.791 --> 00:20:35.370
She looks like some
kind of sailor.

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:36.680
You look like a sailor
or someone

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.530
that is a fan of sailors.

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:40.920
I don't know.

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.360
The striped shirt just
kind of reminded me.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.150
I think I've already ruined the
surprise with this one.

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:47.510
I was too busy click happy.

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:52.300
But the before version of
this was simply this.

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:58.050
And you can see there's actually
nothing pretty on the

00:20:58.050 --> 00:20:59.825
other side of that wall.

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:04.200
I think it was the striped shirt
that made me kind of

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.350
think sailor.

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:07.720
And then that breeze stirred
the other breeze.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.340
I was like sailor, well where
would a sailor be hanging out,

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:11.800
maybe in the harbor.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:13.860
So then I got the idea to
put the harbor in there.

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:17.550
And then the whole complementary
colors and

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:20.876
having the yellow, yellow meets
the blue, which is that

00:21:20.876 --> 00:21:22.530
put me obviously out
of the sky, on the

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:25.034
other side of the wall.

00:21:25.034 --> 00:21:26.420
It's pretty simple.

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:30.240
There's not much of a concept
other than making some nice

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:34.138
colors and you like sailors.

00:21:34.138 --> 00:21:36.650
SHANTIA VENEY: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:37.780
JAIME IBARRA: So we're all
familiar with these.

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:38.840
This is the final one, right?

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:40.090
So the before--

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:44.560
and for the first time, now
you know what the heck I'm

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:46.940
talking about.

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:49.300
I think there's a
car out there.

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:52.280
There's like a little raised
parking lot of the ice cream

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:52.990
place next door.

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:55.730
It's good ice cream,
by the way.

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:57.726
And that's it.

00:21:57.726 --> 00:22:00.610
That was nice.

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:05.980
I liked the little portholes
that were coming through.

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:10.320
Because I do so much
post-production, I'm always

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:15.370
shooting with post-production
in mind, at least thinking

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:17.720
about the possibilities
of what I could do.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:22.025
And the first thing I do is kind
of weigh all of the-- or

00:22:22.025 --> 00:22:25.520
identify all of the potential
caveats or the potential

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.020
problems of that photo.

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:29.570
And try to figure out what it
is I need to deal away with

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:32.700
and try to establish what are
some possibilities, some

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:36.000
directions that I could go with
this, and is everything

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.650
ideal to allow that to happen?

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:43.080
So always, always thinking not
necessarily what the final

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:43.620
image of mine.

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:46.570
Because look I said, even if I
think I have an idea of how

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:48.940
I'm going to do the
post-production at the time

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:51.590
I'm shooting it, 99% of the
time that I'm wrong.

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:52.820
That's not at all what
I'm going to--

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:55.520
I'll have this grand idea about
what I think it is I

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:56.240
want to do.

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.970
That idea always gets
thrown away.

00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:01.600
I never do that one,
like with this.

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:06.030
And I really had no idea what
was going to do with this.

00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:08.300
And this one.

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:10.315
Everybody know who
Trey Ratcliff is?

00:23:10.315 --> 00:23:10.780
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:15.840
JAIME IBARRA: So a long time
ago, Trey contacted me for a

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:16.680
post-production session.

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.060
He actually paid me--

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:19.040
paid me!--

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:22.710
to take a post-production,
my color grading class.

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:23.640
And I was like is awesome.

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:25.275
And Trey came to my house.

00:23:25.275 --> 00:23:26.910
And I'm like this is so cool.

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:30.530
And he walked in and when it
came time for me to show him

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:33.850
my workstation, where I do all
my editing, he was like OK,

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:34.700
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:37.550
He was like, where's
your pen tablet?

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:42.840
And I was like, yeah, it's
at the Best Buy still.

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.810
I keep it on the shelf with the
other ones so it doesn't

00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:45.470
get lonely.

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:46.490
And he's like, really?

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:49.860
I was like, yeah, I never
actually had a pen tablet.

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:52.030
And he said that surprises me.

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:53.680
He goes is there a
reason for that?

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.360
I was, no.

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:59.040
But not meaning to, but he kind
of made me go well, maybe

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:00.010
I should get one.

00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:03.850
And sure enough the next
day, I was like I'm

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:04.200
going to Best Buy.

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:06.320
I going to go get my pen
tablet from them.

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:09.780
And I brought it home and
I hated it, oh my god.

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:12.780
For years and years and years,
I just did everything that I

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:14.550
do with the mouse.

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:17.430
And that's all I knew.

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:20.160
And the thing felt like such
an alien thing in my hands.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.770
And I remember struggling.

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:23.870
I think everyone goes through
this the first time they use a

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:25.470
pen tablet.

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:29.930
I forced myself for two
weeks to use nothing

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:32.320
but my Wacom tablet.

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:35.230
And I used it for everything,
just general computing.

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:40.490
I never used my mouse to
click on anything.

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:49.790
And once it didn't feel so alien
in my hand, I said well,

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:52.380
maybe I can do something
with it.

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:57.200
And I gave up quickly on the
idea of well, maybe the things

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.750
that I've been doing with the
mouse this whole time are

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:01.920
going to be so much easier
with the pen.

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:04.630
I put the kibosh on that
idea really quickly.

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:07.470
But it did allow me to do a
lot of things that I could

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:10.560
never have imagined doing
with just the mouse.

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:15.040
And this image was actually
part of that whole

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:16.570
familiarization.

00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:19.770
It took me about a week
to produce this.

00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:23.180
I probably would do it in a
little bit less time now.

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:28.110
But this image was born out of
my frustration in trying to

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:31.320
familiarize myself with
my pen tablet.

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:37.440
And this photo of the model, the
original photo, was taken

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:42.400
some six or seven years prior
to my doing this whole Wacom

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:45.550
tablet experiment
familiarization operation.

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:47.890
And I never did anything with
the original photo just

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:51.750
because it was nothing
that ever excited me.

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:54.680
I'm going to go to the
original photo.

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:57.260
I'm making sure that you're all
seeing the original photo.

00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:59.665
So I'm going to turn head toward
my the screen now.

00:25:59.665 --> 00:26:05.600
And come on, hello, that's
the original photo.

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:09.000
And just one more time,
I'm going to go back.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.740
And this is what we ended
up with and this is

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:14.202
the original one.

00:26:14.202 --> 00:26:21.370
And in my constant striving for
juxtaposition in a final

00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:26.070
image, the sullen,
angry look on her

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:30.220
face is not make believe.

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:32.930
That is she really is
sullen and angry.

00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:37.220
We had just walked like 2 and
1/2, 3 miles through some

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:39.240
pretty horrible mosquitoes.

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:43.540
And I think we both have dog
flop on our shoes by the time

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:44.590
we made it through this.

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:48.370
And the silo thing that looks
so potentially amazing from

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:51.130
the street, once we finally
got to it, it was so

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:52.180
disappointing.

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:54.220
And it was hot and it
was just humid.

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:56.960
And we were not having fun.

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:59.400
So this bored kind of like--
she's like oh, my god, just

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.840
take the photo, take the
photo, take the photo.

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:03.470
I took the photo and then I
never did anything with it.

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:07.140
But that same bored, I don't
really want to be here

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:11.130
expression in the context of
the original photo, that's

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:13.520
just-- you know, it
is what it is.

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:18.260
But you put this swirling mass
of doom right behind her, with

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:21.190
that same bored expression,
like yeah, OK, yeah, it's

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:23.840
another one of these death
things happening behind me.

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:26.120
I like that juxtaposition
of that.

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:31.200
And that's just an aesthetic
that appeals to me.

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:34.540
It's because I wouldn't be that
stoic and bored if that

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:35.740
was going on behind me.

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:37.730
That was my thought anyway.

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:39.890
And that was my first
experiment.

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:41.335
If you guys remember the--

00:27:41.335 --> 00:27:44.970
I kind of a painted in the
hair with Shantia, the

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:46.580
time-lapse video I showed you.

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:49.770
That was actually my first
experiment with visually

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:51.570
painting in hair.

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:55.810
Because her real hair was not
that at all, as you can see.

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:58.550
So baby steps, which is
learning, learning.

00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:01.190
I'm still learning.

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:05.500
I think the bit of the dress
that you see that's kind of

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:08.310
floofing out behind her,
obviously that wasn't

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:09.290
happening in this photo.

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:14.430
So I actually borrowed that bit
of dress that you see in

00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:18.020
the final image, I borrowed
that bit from a different

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:20.390
photo in that same series.

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:23.490
And I think I probably put three
or four photos together

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:25.540
just to get the dress
material.

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:29.464
And that's just the
way with that one.

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:37.200
And this one, remember the trial
by Greyhound, when I was

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.130
going down the road, I was
taking photos out the window

00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:40.140
of the Greyhound?

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:43.420
This is one of the photos I
took, not of the model, but

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:45.060
the windmills, the turbines.

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:46.020
What do you call those?

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:47.490
Wind turbines, the
electric ones,

00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:49.430
are they still windmills?

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:51.390
They can be.

00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:54.820
That's another one of the photos
I took and never did

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:58.240
anything with.

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:04.830
It's just a simple composition
that I just used as a

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:06.080
background for this photo.

00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:14.570
That's the original for
the background anyway.

00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:18.050
AUDIENCE: Does the original
crop out the head?

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:18.680
JAIME IBARRA: No.

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:20.290
It was my mistake.

00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:24.200
When I was doing the photo of
the model, I was actually just

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.520
getting my light set up.

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:29.000
I don't shoot usually
in live view.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.765
But I was just kind of looking
at the light and I just

00:29:31.765 --> 00:29:32.540
took a quick one.

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:35.430
And I just happened to have
her head chop off.

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:37.490
Maybe it was an accident,
maybe it wasn't.

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:38.130
I don't know.

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:41.400
But nonetheless, her head
was chopped off.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:45.990
But I ended up oddly enough
using that as the final photo.

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:50.270
And this began sort of a series
of me chopping people's

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:53.050
heads off on purpose
in photos.

00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:58.200
And I think it makes you think
a little bit more.

00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:58.560
I don't know.

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:01.080
I know this is like if you're
taking photos of people, the

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.700
last thing you should
do is like chop

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:05.310
off a limb or a head.

00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:08.360
Or you know, you want to keep
them intact as possible.

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:09.610
But I don't know.

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.640
It sort of triggers
the imagination.

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:17.590
It's like well, who is she or
what is she doing out by the

00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:18.370
windows and stuff?

00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:19.280
And you don't know.

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:21.310
And is she pretty?

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:21.990
I mean maybe she's not.

00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.610
You don't know.

00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:26.490
Like I think it just leaves
more to the imagination.

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:29.240
Again, it was actually
kind of an accident.

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:32.720
I don't know why I ended up
going with her head being

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:35.285
chopped off as my
final selection.

00:30:35.285 --> 00:30:39.750
It's kind of like the end of
"Lost in Translation" where he

00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:42.090
whispers something
into her ear.

00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:44.070
You don't know what it
was that he said.

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:46.370
But they seemed happy
about it.

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:49.290
And so you're left to draw your
own conclusions and you

00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:51.060
fill in your own blanks there.

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:53.720
And I think if you leave enough
blanks in the story,

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:56.700
people are going to fill in
those blanks as they see fit.

00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:59.380
I think some people, like with
me, I imagine in "Lost in

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:02.400
Translation," I imagine he
said something happy.

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.250
That was just the way I
perceived it and some other

00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:06.220
people might not have imagined
such a thing.

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:06.710
I don't know.

00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:10.090
Anybody imagine something
sad in that?

00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:13.080
Has anyone else seen
that movie but me?

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:15.670
Has anyone else actually liked
that movie besides me?

00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:16.120
OK.

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:16.930
I'm not alone.

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:20.450
See, Pumpkin, I'm not the only
one that likes that movie.

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:23.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.420
JAIME IBARRA: But this started
my whole, let's chop people's

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:27.490
heads off in a photo.

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:31.570
I have a whole series
of these that I do.

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:33.730
This is not one of them.

00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:37.180
This is a model that
I've shot.

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:40.010
And I found out down
the road the that

00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:42.240
actually does fire spinning.

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:45.080
And I remember well.

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:46.680
let's go do it.

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:50.270
And the light that's lighting
her up is really just the

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:53.300
light from the fire.

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:56.950
And she is not exactly
in focus.

00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:59.040
But I didn't really think
that was the point.

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:00.380
And I didn't feel that
was important--

00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:03.626
and I think the motion
of that.

00:32:03.626 --> 00:32:10.240
And the only thing I really did
in post-production was I

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:12.000
dropped in the sky.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.700
And I can show you
the original.

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:18.070
I'm going to turn my head and
make sure you guys are seeing

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:18.640
the original.

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:19.500
OK.

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:21.570
So it's really just trees.

00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:23.360
It was like 3:00 in the morning
at this place in

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:27.700
Austin called, yest, the
Enchanted Forest.

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:30.020
And we're down by the creek.

00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:32.450
In case she were to catch on
fire, she could just go jump

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:33.705
in the creek really quick.

00:32:33.705 --> 00:32:35.920
I remember asking her, I said is
that a good idea for you to

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:38.050
have your hair down while
you're doing that?

00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:39.181
She was like, no.

00:32:39.181 --> 00:32:41.140
I went OK.

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:42.690
She said well, the water
is right there.

00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:43.268
I can just jump in the water.

00:32:43.268 --> 00:32:44.210
I'll be OK.

00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:46.080
So I just let her do it.

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:47.980
Like hey, she knows
what she's doing.

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:49.030
I'm just here to take
the photos.

00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:55.620
All I did was really just sort
of smoothed out the curves

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:58.260
that the flames are making in
that photo and then just

00:32:58.260 --> 00:32:59.880
dropped in the sky.

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:06.120
And like I'm a huge fan
of orange meets blue.

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:10.550
I mean you have the orange tones
in her skin and in the

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:13.290
fire meets that blue sky.

00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:18.390
And in my mind, that's like
one of the nicest sounds.

00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:20.910
And we've got quite a bit of
orange meets blue in our

00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:22.560
house, don't we?

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:27.390
And my tattoos, I had
very similar--

00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:29.670
I wanted control over what
colors touch what colors.

00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:32.020
I was like I'm going to be
looking at this all day long.

00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:34.580
I want it to be something
I'm OK with looking at.

00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:36.550
And so there's a lot of
orange touching blue.

00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:40.290
And you'll see a lot of orange
meets blue in my photos.

00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:45.210
And that's just an aesthetic
tendency that I lean towards.

00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:52.230
And let's go to this one.

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:57.960
And this is Shantia again
in a bowling alley.

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:00.170
How often do you get to shoot
in a bowling alley?

00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:01.670
You don't, oddly.

00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:03.600
You can't walk out in
the lane anyway.

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:06.810
But we were able to at
this place one night.

00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:09.639
I have no before version.

00:34:09.639 --> 00:34:14.199
These are the last few photos
that I have for you.

00:34:14.199 --> 00:34:15.300
But there's no before.

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:16.760
These are just the final.

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:19.159
And again, orange meets blue.

00:34:19.159 --> 00:34:23.290
There's rather a lot of orange
meets blue in this one.

00:34:23.290 --> 00:34:25.210
AUDIENCE: Was that deliberate
putting the crown on her head?

00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:27.139
JAIME IBARRA: What's that?

00:34:27.139 --> 00:34:27.230
What's that?

00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:27.650
Will you repeat?

00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:29.699
AUDIENCE: Was it deliberate
putting the crown on her head?

00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:32.550
JAIME IBARRA: People have
asked that question.

00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:34.070
Actually I didn't notice it.

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:36.560
I don't know if you did.

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:38.420
But you know what somebody
else noticed?

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:45.139
Yeah, I think the fingers, her
fingers are mimicking the

00:34:45.139 --> 00:34:48.530
trifecta of awesomeness with
the crown above her head.

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:52.580
And that wasn't necessarily
intentional.

00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:55.520
Your reason for doing your
fingers that way were?

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:57.694
SHANTIA VENEY: It's the most
graceful position to put your

00:34:57.694 --> 00:34:59.250
hands in because that's where
all your weight is.

00:34:59.250 --> 00:34:59.560
JAIME IBARRA: Yeah.

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:01.070
It's most graceful-- did
everybody hear that?

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:01.850
I'll repeat that.

00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:04.680
It's the most graceful position
to put your hand in

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:06.640
down there because she knows
what she's doing in front of

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:08.240
the camera.

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:09.640
It just looks pretty.

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:12.580
And yeah, I didn't notice
any of that.

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:15.440
But yeah, a lot of people have
asked that about the crown.

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:16.740
Actually I should just
go yep, yeah.

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:17.640
We knew exactly.

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:22.091
That's exactly the case.

00:35:22.091 --> 00:35:23.725
So that's our shot at
the bowling alley.

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:33.020
Actually, this poor girl
actually sprained her foot in

00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:33.740
this shoot.

00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:37.050
And we had tried and tried and
tried many, many times to get

00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:37.910
her to jump.

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:44.050
She's actually maybe a foot and
a half off the ground in

00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:46.520
this photo.

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:48.035
Anything that I'm going to
show you from here out, I

00:35:48.035 --> 00:35:49.130
don't have the originals
of these.

00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:54.810
But I just simply extended the
height of the siding wall that

00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:55.730
we're shooting against.

00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:58.770
So just make it look like you
don't know how high up we are.

00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:03.120
But I remember when she jumped,
she just went sailing.

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:07.320
And then when she landed, I just
remember it sounded like

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.330
a five pound ham hit
the sidewalk.

00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:10.145
It was like smack.

00:36:10.145 --> 00:36:11.940
I was oh, that can't be good.

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:13.360
And she goes, we're done.

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:16.360
But that was the last photo
that we got that day.

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:21.830
And mercifully, it came
out really nice.

00:36:21.830 --> 00:36:25.790
I like to shoot a lot of fabric,
like flying fabric.

00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:29.010
That was one of my early
successes with that.

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:38.270
This one, we couldn't really
get much that day.

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:43.450
And I remember it was me and
a small team of people,

00:36:43.450 --> 00:36:45.170
including the model.

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:49.140
And the model had brought a
bunch of stuff, just scarves.

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:52.560
She had a bunch of scarves in
a bag and different clothes.

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:58.090
And I remember out of
frustration we were like--

00:36:58.090 --> 00:37:00.180
we weren't getting results that
I was really happy with.

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:01.990
So we decided OK, let's
take a break.

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:03.760
So we said well, what else
do you have with you

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:05.660
today, like what else?

00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:07.230
And I didn't ask
that question.

00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:09.190
My stylist that day asked
that question.

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:15.640
So in this photo, she's looking
over at the stylist.

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:18.430
But the stylist said well, pick
that up and hold it up.

00:37:18.430 --> 00:37:21.590
And by the third or fourth time,
she reached down and

00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:22.700
grabbed different scarves.

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:24.740
And was holding the
scarves out.

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:25.860
She was holding them
out towards me,

00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:27.230
kind of an arm's length.

00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:28.160
And she's OK, that's cool.

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:29.250
Let me see that one, let
me see this one,

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:29.800
let me see that one.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:32.860
But when she held this one
up, it's at arm's length.

00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:35.160
And she's got her head turned
and she's looking at my--

00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:36.670
she's talking to my
stylist actually.

00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:39.690
So I just shot through
the scarf as she

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:41.240
was holding it up.

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:46.300
And it was kind of sort of a
happy accident, sort of, which

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:49.340
I get quite a lot of those.

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:51.160
Sometimes accidents are good.

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:53.290
But you have to make these
moments happen.

00:37:53.290 --> 00:37:57.450
And my stylist that day was
a little more experienced.

00:37:57.450 --> 00:37:59.690
This one goes back
many, many years.

00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:01.640
And I realize now what
she would doing.

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:05.010
She was trying to get the model
to pick up the different

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:06.240
pieces of clothes.

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:08.540
She's creating opportunities
for me to shoot.

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:09.320
But I think I caught on.

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:10.940
I was oh, I see what
you're doing.

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:12.540
OK, I got it now.

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:16.870
But now, I'm more cognizant
of these things.

00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:19.530
You do have to create
moments like this.

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:29.220
This juxtaposition in my mind,
this is the last couple you

00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:31.720
would ever expect to see out in
the pretty, pretty, pretty

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:35.140
field of flowers.

00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:39.120
And I remember I was driving
over to get my

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:40.250
tattoo worked on.

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:43.520
The lady in the photo
is my tattoo artist

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:45.580
and that's her husband.

00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:48.460
One of the few weddings that
I've ever photographed and

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:49.800
actually enjoyed.

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:52.540
But I remember I was driving out
to get my tattoo worked on

00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:57.090
and I went a different route to
where she works and drove--

00:38:57.090 --> 00:38:59.390
I was like that's an actual
field of sunflowers.

00:38:59.390 --> 00:39:00.680
I never see that.

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:03.520
And I was thinking like what
model could I get to

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:05.655
photograph in front
of the sunflowers?

00:39:05.655 --> 00:39:06.940
And I went no, wait.

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:08.570
And I remember where
I was going.

00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:10.950
And it's like I'm going to
get them to do this.

00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:12.730
And of course, they
loved the idea.

00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:15.560
It was like sunflowers, like
no one's ever asked us that

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:16.240
ever, ever.

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:18.420
It's was like let's do it.

00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:22.220
Then we got chased out of
that property actually.

00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:25.070
We were shooting-- we were
just on the sidewalk.

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:26.840
And there's a kind of main

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:28.500
thoroughfare that went through.

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:31.780
And as I was standing
and shooting, this

00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:33.290
pickup truck pulls up.

00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:35.610
He's like, what are you doing?

00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:36.190
What are you doing?

00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:38.900
It was like oh, something
bad I guess.

00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:40.500
I said oh, we're just
shooting it.

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:42.540
And I said, is this
your property?

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:44.240
He was like yeah, those
are my flowers too.

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:45.650
And I was like, OK.

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:46.710
He goes what are you doing?

00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:48.150
And I made up this thing.

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:51.090
I said oh, they're
a famous band.

00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:51.740
He goes who?

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:52.720
You know I never
heard of them.

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:54.840
And I said oh, they're called

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:57.770
Trampoline Stroganoff actually.

00:39:57.770 --> 00:39:59.060
I said, I don't like them.

00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:01.035
The kids do.

00:40:01.035 --> 00:40:03.350
And I said we'll be done in
just-- they're famous.

00:40:03.350 --> 00:40:06.630
And he goes, two minutes and
I'm gong to call the cops.

00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:08.910
And I was like does that mean
we have two minutes to shoot

00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:10.690
and then you're going to call
the cops or you're going to

00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:12.190
call them in two minutes
regardless?

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:13.750
And he was like two minutes.

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:14.910
And I was like, OK.

00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:17.630
And I think I took a couple more
photos after that, me and

00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:18.960
Trampoline Stroganoff.

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:22.512
And then we boogied out.

00:40:22.512 --> 00:40:25.706
That's my Trampoline
Stroganoff story.

00:40:25.706 --> 00:40:28.120
They're not really a band.

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:30.590
They should be.

00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:32.530
But more people with their
heads chopped off.

00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:38.360
That really is her camera.

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:40.230
She really does use it.

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:45.010
And I think that photo says
enough about her.

00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:49.400
You don't really need to see her
head to get the idea about

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:50.330
her as a person.

00:40:50.330 --> 00:40:54.690
You got the black nail polish
and you got her thumb ring.

00:40:54.690 --> 00:40:58.590
And she's a rebel, with her
vintage dress and her old

00:40:58.590 --> 00:41:02.660
school film camera, but
with just no head.

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:12.186
And hey, guess what,
more people with

00:41:12.186 --> 00:41:12.770
their heads cut off.

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:15.680
At this one, there's a small
photo of her you can kind of

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:16.900
see in there.

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:20.605
And does anyone else find these
interesting at all?

00:41:20.605 --> 00:41:22.630
If mean if you don't, you don't
have to say yes just to

00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:23.720
make me happy.

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:25.880
But you do, right?

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:26.800
I mean I think there's
something

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:28.810
interesting about them.

00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:31.720
It's not aesthetically pleasing
to most, but--

00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:34.642
AUDIENCE: I think the photo,
in the photo she should be

00:41:34.642 --> 00:41:36.110
holding the Polaroid as well.

00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:37.360
JAIME IBARRA: Yeah.

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:41.400
That's a good idea.

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.200
Say one breathe, to
another breathe.

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:45.810
And the next time I do one
of these, we'll do that.

00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:47.792
And that will be
my nod to you.

00:41:47.792 --> 00:41:49.720
AUDIENCE: Just have her
whole bag be Polaroid.

00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:50.550
JAIME IBARRA: Exactly.

00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:51.930
Yeah, good idea.

00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:57.966
Guess what, this time not only
did I chop the head off, I got

00:41:57.966 --> 00:41:59.980
rid of the whole torso
pretty much.

00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:06.990
And this remains one of the most
viewed photos that I've

00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:08.210
ever taken.

00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:12.280
And I am not able to put
my finger on why

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:12.930
and I always wonder.

00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:17.660
Like I had this up for a while
on "DeviantART." And it got

00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:21.390
like 1.6 million views
on this one photo.

00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:24.920
And I was thinking like if I
could figure out what it is

00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:28.460
that's making people want to
look at this photo and just

00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:31.950
replicate that from here on out,
this is one of the things

00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:32.770
that's got me.

00:42:32.770 --> 00:42:37.450
To this day, I scratch my head
and wonder what it is about it

00:42:37.450 --> 00:42:41.850
that garnered so many views and
it had so much attention?

00:42:41.850 --> 00:42:42.160
Any guesses?

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:44.410
AUDIENCE: Does the model have
a ballet background?

00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:45.590
JAIME IBARRA: No, actually.

00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:46.410
No.

00:42:46.410 --> 00:42:46.870
AUDIENCE: Standing
on her tiptoes.

00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:47.330
JAIME IBARRA: No.

00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:52.010
And the reality of this was
she had just showed up to

00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:55.880
shoot for a couple of days and
she was all excited to show us

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:58.490
all the clothes and stuff
that she had brought.

00:42:58.490 --> 00:43:05.860
And she had just drove all the
way from New York and everyone

00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:07.030
was having a little
bit to drink.

00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:11.880
And there's a little tiny, tiny,
tiny bit of wine left in

00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:13.105
that glass right there.

00:43:13.105 --> 00:43:14.110
And that's what we are having.

00:43:14.110 --> 00:43:17.380
But she was in the process-- we
were having a glass of wine

00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:21.700
and she wanted to show us her
friend's red shoes that she

00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:23.640
stole, or borrowed.

00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:24.700
"Sorry."

00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:25.720
And she goes, oh, you got
to check these out.

00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:26.690
So she runs over.

00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:29.240
And she put them on and at the
same time tried on this

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:29.810
vintage dress.

00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:30.860
And she came back in the room.

00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:33.800
And she was just showing
us the shoes.

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:36.150
And while she was showing the
shoes, I was taking photos of

00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:36.880
the whole thing.

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:40.480
And that's how I ended
up just getting it.

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:45.078
It was rather not
planned at all.

00:43:45.078 --> 00:43:47.420
AUDIENCE: Did you
crop it in post?

00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:48.980
JAIME IBARRA: This is
how it ended up.

00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:53.000
Yeah, I did not crop this
one in post at all.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.890
She was just running into the
other room, trying on

00:43:55.890 --> 00:43:57.540
something, and run
into this room.

00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:58.780
And I would go, OK, good,
click, click, click.

00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:00.330
And she'd run off and just
rinse and repeat.

00:44:00.330 --> 00:44:02.590
And so we had a better idea of
what we were going to shoot

00:44:02.590 --> 00:44:04.830
the next day and just kind of
planned out the wardrobe.

00:44:04.830 --> 00:44:07.620
So this is just one of the
outfits that she quickly

00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:10.440
changed into.

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:12.430
That's really all I have
to say about that one.

00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:20.450
Another one, we were
doing laundry.

00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:22.990
Oop, thank you.

00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:25.060
Well, what you'll see is the
most amazing photo you've ever

00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:29.390
seen in your life when
it decides to change.

00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:32.160
So I can go ahead and prime
the story for you.

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:34.460
Well literally, we're
doing laundry.

00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:39.070
And would help if I click back
and maybe kind of kick it a

00:44:39.070 --> 00:44:41.320
little bit?

00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:41.720
No.

00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:43.901
It didn't help, did it?

00:44:43.901 --> 00:44:46.286
AUDIENCE: Now, you know why
that one's viewed so much.

00:44:46.286 --> 00:44:47.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:47.230 --> 00:44:48.780
JAIME IBARRA: Because you
can't click off of

00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:50.520
it, there you go.

00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:51.510
That's it, yeah.

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:56.713
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:56.713 --> 00:45:00.380
AUDIENCE: Did you have light
set up for this picture?

00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:03.695
JAIME IBARRA: With the one with
the legs and the shoes,

00:45:03.695 --> 00:45:04.510
there was some.

00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:06.630
Although I do want to
point out I almost

00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:08.520
never use studio lighting.

00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:15.580
To this day, I own one camera
body, one lens.

00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:17.510
And the extent of my equipment
ends there.

00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:20.080
Well, actually we have
a tripod now.

00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:22.290
So there's a third piece
of studio gear was

00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:23.350
added to the arsenal.

00:45:23.350 --> 00:45:25.870
It's a rather cheap, shoddy
tripod as well.

00:45:25.870 --> 00:45:26.010
SHANTIA VENEY: To take
pictures of clouds.

00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:27.680
JAIME IBARRA: To take pictures
of the clouds.

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:30.950
No.

00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:33.580
Yeah, there was some light
set up in that shot.

00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:35.150
But that was not my light.

00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:37.660
It was the light that belonged
to my friend, whose house we

00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:38.900
were in at the time.

00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:42.580
But most of the time, I just
shoot whatever is available.

00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:44.520
I not object to using
studio light.

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:45.850
I just don't own any.

00:45:45.850 --> 00:45:48.820
But you will see studio lighting
pop up every now and

00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:49.670
again in my shots.

00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:52.580
But it's kind of rare.

00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:55.070
And this was I was just
doing laundry one day.

00:45:55.070 --> 00:45:59.850
And this is kind of serendipity
I guess.

00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:03.720
So I was like the laundrette
that we went to was not the

00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:05.960
normal one we would
normally go to.

00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:08.270
I said "not" and negatives
a lot in that one

00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:09.230
sentence, didn't I?

00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:13.270
It's not the one we didn't not
never not go to, normally not.

00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:15.330
So the one we normally went
to was really crowded.

00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:17.790
So we ended up having to go down
the street another mile.

00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:20.710
And this particular one happened
to have these really

00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:24.650
brightly colored industrial
dryers along this one wall.

00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:27.640
And it just so happened that
she was wearing these

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:29.770
ridiculous stockings.

00:46:29.770 --> 00:46:32.750
And it looks like
we planned it.

00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:35.720
But we honestly didn't.

00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:38.670
And we almost got kicked
out when she decided to

00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:40.670
climb into the dryer.

00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:44.070
And I think had we not already
had 12 actual loads of wash

00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:47.788
going, we would have
been kicked out.

00:46:47.788 --> 00:46:49.930
AUDIENCE: More orange
and blue.

00:46:49.930 --> 00:46:50.000
JAIME IBARRA: Yeah.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.220
More orange meets blue, yup.

00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:55.680
But again, that was just
luck of the draw.

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:57.230
This was not planned
in any way.

00:46:57.230 --> 00:47:01.010
But I liked it a lot.

00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:03.490
And look, it's another photo
without someone's head.

00:47:06.154 --> 00:47:10.130
Can you see that the interest
I guess it would generate.

00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:14.650
If you were like this, well,
who's in the dryer?

00:47:14.650 --> 00:47:19.000
I mean how people actually wish
they could see her head?

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.750
All of you who didn't raise
your hand are correct.

00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:22.661
That's exactly right.

00:47:22.661 --> 00:47:23.643
AUDIENCE: Doesn't she
look like one

00:47:23.643 --> 00:47:25.610
of the wicked witches?

00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:26.780
JAIME IBARRA: I'm not
going to say.

00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:28.190
I'm not answering
that question--

00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:30.240
I'll answer that question
afterwards.

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:33.100
But I won't do it while
this is being filmed.

00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:33.460
SHANTIA VENEY: It's not me.

00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:36.030
JAIME IBARRA: It's
not Shantia.

00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:39.680
Yeah, I actually named this
photo "Reprobate," which is

00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:41.760
something my mother
used to call me.

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:43.360
I never knew what
that word meant.

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:45.960
Everybody knows what
reprobate means.

00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:49.030
It's not a nice thing to call
your kid, I found out later.

00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:51.180
If I was doing something wrong,
she was like, hey,

00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:53.250
reprobate, go clean your room
or don't do that any more.

00:47:53.250 --> 00:47:54.400
It's not a nice thing.

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:58.180
So that's the name of this
photo, "Reprobate," if that

00:47:58.180 --> 00:47:59.500
gives you any idea.

00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:01.250
I don't think there's any photos
of you with your head

00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:02.090
chopped off.

00:48:02.090 --> 00:48:02.930
SHANTIA VENEY: Not yet.

00:48:02.930 --> 00:48:03.500
JAIME IBARRA: Not yet.

00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:04.040
Be nice.

00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:05.360
SHANTIA VENEY: I got to do
something really wrong.

00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:05.800
JAIME IBARRA: Yeah.

00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:09.080
You have to do something
really wrong first.

00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:11.000
And we're back to this again.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.110
So I kind of plowed through
those a little

00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:14.640
quicker than I thought.

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:22.370
So actually if anyone has any
questions, I'll open up the

00:48:22.370 --> 00:48:24.770
floor to that.

00:48:24.770 --> 00:48:28.670
AUDIENCE: The model who you shot
in front of the silo and

00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:30.500
then you put the tornado in
front of her seven years

00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:33.750
later, or behind her, did
you still keep in

00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:34.560
contact with her?

00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:36.480
Were you able to give her
the final product?

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:37.640
JAIME IBARRA: Yes.

00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:38.860
AUDIENCE: What did she think?

00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:40.710
JAIME IBARRA: She said
oh, that's cool.

00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:42.260
AUDIENCE: It was like
seven years later.

00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:43.130
JAIME IBARRA: Yeah,
seven later.

00:48:43.130 --> 00:48:44.240
OK, well, thanks.

00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:46.950
That's cool, I guess.

00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:49.100
When possible, I do keep in
touch with everyone that I've

00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:49.690
photographed.

00:48:49.690 --> 00:48:53.890
You know how people kind of fade
in and out of your life.

00:48:53.890 --> 00:48:55.840
But yeah, I think
she liked it.

00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:59.070
She's not a very expressive
person by nature.

00:48:59.070 --> 00:49:03.230
So maybe it meant to be more
complimentary than it sounded.

00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:06.150
But yeah, I think
she liked it.

00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:08.510
AUDIENCE: So obviously
you can do

00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:10.040
amazing things with Photoshop.

00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:13.650
So I'm curious why bother
putting the models in front of

00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:16.400
sunflowers or in bowling alleys,
where you could easily

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:17.810
do that on your own?

00:49:17.810 --> 00:49:20.290
JAIME IBARRA: Because I'd
rather not have to spend

00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:22.180
hours, and hours, and
hours, and hours,

00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:23.515
and hours in Photoshop.

00:49:23.515 --> 00:49:25.180
AUDIENCE: Aren't you going
to change it anyway?

00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:26.170
JAIME IBARRA: Not necessarily.

00:49:26.170 --> 00:49:28.090
Like for instance, with
this one, there really

00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:29.710
wasn't much to change.

00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:31.560
I mean I guess that's
a good point.

00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:33.490
I mean we could have just
shot in the house.

00:49:33.490 --> 00:49:35.040
And I could have just shot
you against a wall.

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:37.700
And then if I had already
taken this

00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:40.070
photo, at one point--

00:49:40.070 --> 00:49:40.970
SHANTIA VENEY: There's
something to be said

00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:41.420
for doing it right.

00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:43.260
JAIME IBARRA: Oh yeah,
that's exactly it.

00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:45.210
There's something to be said
for doing it right and get

00:49:45.210 --> 00:49:49.250
getting it right from
the get-go.

00:49:49.250 --> 00:49:50.720
It's kind of a safety net.

00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:54.020
I guess if it didn't look
exactly like I wanted it to

00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:57.060
when I was shooting, knowing
that you could make it that

00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:59.130
way in post-production.

00:49:59.130 --> 00:50:01.590
It's just a nice feeling to know
that it could be done.

00:50:01.590 --> 00:50:05.290
But it's easier and better if
you can just have everything

00:50:05.290 --> 00:50:07.240
in place when you're actually
taking the photos.

00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:09.360
AUDIENCE: As long as nobody is
behind me, one other question?

00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:13.210
So these models, how do they
feel about when they get their

00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:16.620
photo back without their head?

00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:18.880
JAIME IBARRA: I have not
been complemented too

00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:20.930
many times like that.

00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:23.960
But usually like they've gotten
a bunch of other photos

00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:25.290
with their head.

00:50:25.290 --> 00:50:27.830
So this is like them receiving
a headless one, that was just

00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:31.090
kind of a one off,
they're-- oh.

00:50:31.090 --> 00:50:34.650
Yeah, I've received like
that face a lot.

00:50:34.650 --> 00:50:37.980
They would look at the photo
and they go OK, well, you

00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:38.990
don't have to like that one.

00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:41.510
But I've given them other
photos with their head.

00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:43.890
But a couple of people with
their heads chopped off

00:50:43.890 --> 00:50:45.470
actually liked them.

00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:47.390
The girl with the glass
of wine and the red

00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:50.010
shoes, she liked it.

00:50:50.010 --> 00:50:53.600
So it's not an always
thing, but yeah.

00:50:56.210 --> 00:50:58.040
Anyone else?

00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:00.258
Any other questions?

00:51:00.258 --> 00:51:01.656
What's that?

00:51:01.656 --> 00:51:03.054
AUDIENCE: Is the blowing
hair there real?

00:51:03.054 --> 00:51:05.140
Or was that in post-production?

00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:07.310
JAIME IBARRA: It was in post.

00:51:07.310 --> 00:51:12.300
It was all painted digitally
with my Wacom tablet skills

00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:13.410
that I gained.

00:51:13.410 --> 00:51:15.830
AUDIENCE: Well, so how exactly
did you do that?

00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:16.790
How did you paint the hair?

00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:18.930
It seems like kind of
it's not nontrivial.

00:51:18.930 --> 00:51:20.332
JAIME IBARRA: It seems
what, I'm sorry?

00:51:20.332 --> 00:51:21.887
AUDIENCE: Like nontrivial, it
seems like pretty hard to

00:51:21.887 --> 00:51:22.930
doing something like that.

00:51:22.930 --> 00:51:24.830
JAIME IBARRA: It took a while.

00:51:24.830 --> 00:51:28.600
I did it with the
Wacom tablet.

00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:32.490
I have special brushes that
were actually made for

00:51:32.490 --> 00:51:36.235
creating hair in an
illustration.

00:51:36.235 --> 00:51:39.370
They were passed on to me by a
friend of mine who does a lot

00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:42.190
of illustrations for book
covers, with her publishing

00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:43.160
company that she works with.

00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:46.415
And she was gracious enough to
pass along all of her brushes

00:51:46.415 --> 00:51:49.190
she used to create hair with.

00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:51.100
But they don't make it easy.

00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:53.450
But they're a good
starting point.

00:51:53.450 --> 00:51:59.400
But there's probably a 1,000 to
2,000 strokes of the brush

00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:00.380
at work to get this to happen.

00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:01.820
So it's is a gradual thing.

00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:04.070
It just builds, and it builds,
and it builds, and it builds,

00:52:04.070 --> 00:52:05.650
and it builds.

00:52:05.650 --> 00:52:09.730
And yeah, it takes a while,
it takes a while to do.

00:52:09.730 --> 00:52:12.210
But we couldn't control
the wind that day.

00:52:12.210 --> 00:52:15.760
And we really didn't have
much control that day.

00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:19.590
So there's a good example of
when post-production can come

00:52:19.590 --> 00:52:22.160
in and save the shot.

00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:26.980
That's the hair.

00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:28.640
It takes a little
bit of patience.

00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:30.280
It's not for everybody,
I don't think.

00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:34.255
But I'd rather have a nice
fan and her real

00:52:34.255 --> 00:52:35.710
hair blowing amazingly.

00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:36.830
That would have been
so much better.

00:52:36.830 --> 00:52:39.010
But how many hours did I
spend doing that hair?

00:52:39.010 --> 00:52:39.680
SHANTIA VENEY: Quite
a long time.

00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:42.540
JAIME IBARRA: A pretty long
time, several hours.

00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:45.550
Many a meal could've been baked
in the time it took.

00:52:45.550 --> 00:52:45.790
SHANTIA VENEY: Many
a meal was baked.

00:52:45.790 --> 00:52:47.530
JAIME IBARRA: Many a meal
was baked actually.

00:52:47.530 --> 00:52:50.090
Yeah, it's like she's
a chef, too.

00:52:50.090 --> 00:52:50.410
Yeah?

00:52:50.410 --> 00:52:53.210
AUDIENCE: Can you talk a little
bit about the lack of

00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:56.120
contrast in your final works?

00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:57.170
It's very aesthetic.

00:52:57.170 --> 00:52:58.000
I like it.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.930
But it seems like a lot of
photographers try to push the

00:53:01.930 --> 00:53:05.240
contrast to the max in their
final output image.

00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:08.640
How do your feel contrasts or
the lack of it fits in your

00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:09.250
artistic sense?

00:53:09.250 --> 00:53:11.070
JAIME IBARRA: Well, I'm assuming
you're talking about

00:53:11.070 --> 00:53:13.070
luminosity contrasts.

00:53:13.070 --> 00:53:16.120
Because it looks fairly
washed out, right?

00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:16.960
OK.

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:22.420
So like to me, contrast can
exist in the luminosity realm.

00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:24.780
But there's also
color contrast.

00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:27.380
And I see plenty of
color contrast.

00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:33.880
And I guess in my aesthetic,
that color contrast meets my

00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:35.760
contrast needs I guess.

00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:40.020
But I think the washed out, kind
of faded look maybe stems

00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:43.740
from some nostalgic thing
when I was a child.

00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:46.950
And one of the things I used to
do when we would go to my

00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:48.670
grandmother's house is the first
thing I would do was

00:53:48.670 --> 00:53:51.470
sneak down to the basement and
pull out these boxes of old

00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:53.290
photos that she collected.

00:53:53.290 --> 00:53:55.950
And just I liked looking at
those old faded photos.

00:53:55.950 --> 00:53:59.660
And maybe the seed was
planted then for

00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:03.000
this part of my aesthetic.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:07.250
But I don't necessarily look
for luminosity contrast.

00:54:07.250 --> 00:54:10.670
I look for color contrast.

00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:18.350
Like there's the yellows and
greens in the terrain.

00:54:18.350 --> 00:54:22.870
If those meet a cooler color,
kind of like they are in the

00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:25.620
sky with the cloud, to
me, that's contrast.

00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:28.510
And there's no mistaking where
the two things meet.

00:54:28.510 --> 00:54:31.540
So there's enough contrast
in there, in my opinion.

00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:36.760
But I'm not after these really
sharp, like sharp luminosity

00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:38.340
contrast photos.

00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:41.850
Like a lot of the photos I was
drawn to just as a child were

00:54:41.850 --> 00:54:44.720
like the old photos I
would find in a box.

00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:47.130
So I'm guessing maybe that's
where it came from.

00:54:47.130 --> 00:54:49.460
It's just a leftover,
nostalgic thing that

00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:51.820
influenced my aesthetic sense.

00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:52.570
Thank you.

00:54:52.570 --> 00:54:54.500
Thank you very much
for having me.

00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:59.578
[APPLAUSE]
