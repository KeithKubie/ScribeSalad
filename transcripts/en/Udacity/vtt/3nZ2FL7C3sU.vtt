00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.180
Now let's take what we've learned about calculating life factor and

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.990
apply it to a real-world example.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.700
Here we have a graphic from the New York Times that is

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.960
showing the fuel economy standards for autos between the years of 1978 and 1985.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.560
We have all the information that we need to calculate the life factor for

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.850
this particular graphic.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.820
We have the second and first value for the changes seen in the graphic,

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.110
and also the second and first value for the change that is seen in the data.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.880
Let's use these four numbers to calculate the live factor.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.740
Given that the second value is 27.5 and the first value is 18,

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.950
what is the size of the effect in the data?
