[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.500
- So it's really a privilege
to be up here this afternoon.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.540
I want to first thank Meredith.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.820
I'm going to get
emotional about this.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.750
Meredith has spent so much
time crafting the introductions

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.180
for each and every fellow
before their presentations.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.810
And I think it is just
but one expression

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.990
of her incredible
kindness, generosity,

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.760
and also brilliance.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.790
And I want to thank the
Joy Foundation as well

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.670
for supporting my
fellowship this year.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.100
And I want to thank my
two research partners--

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.230
that I know one's
definitely in the audience--

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.540
Diana Myers, and also
Katherine [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.660
as well, for your just
incredible, intelligent

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.240
engagement with my research.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.220
And I also want to
thank my fellow fellows.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.950
And I see you all
out in the audience.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.620
My conversations with
you, but also more,

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.240
I feel like just
learning from you

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.480
has opened up so many
new, exciting vistas

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.760
of inquiry for me,
and challenged me

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.550
in so many numerous ways.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.370
I also want to give a special
shout out to my family.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.630
And they're all over here.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.560
So they have traveled incredible
distances to be here with me

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.120
this afternoon to support me.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.510
And I'm just so grateful for
their presence this afternoon.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.830
And last, but
certainly not least,

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.970
I want to thank my
partner, Eric, and just

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.460
for all of the incredible
ways that he supports me.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.050
In my talk this
afternoon I'll talk

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.250
about how manuscripts are the
sine qua non of my research.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.950
And Eric is the sine
qua non of my life

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.190
and so I'm thankful for him.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.120
All right.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.670
Enough of that.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.850
All right.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.320
Just over a month ago the
seemingly impossible happened,

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.110
news about a medieval
nun went viral.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.760
On Wednesday, January 9th,
the journal Science Advances

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.130
published online an article in
which the investigators claimed

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.330
that they had found tiny
bits of blue pigment embedded

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.169
within the dental calculus,
or the calcified tooth

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:12.950
tartar of a 40 to
60-year-old nun who

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:20.150
lived sometime between 997 and
1162 CE at a monastic complex

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.330
at Dalheim, Germany.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.600
Microscopic analysis
of the tartar

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.770
reveal that the blue pigment
was lapis lazuli derived

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.510
ultramarine.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.060
It was by far the
most expensive form

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.840
of blue pigment used in
medieval works of art

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.890
because it was mined from a
single region in Afghanistan,

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.130
and thus a luxury trade good.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.280
Within the context of
medieval book production,

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.760
ultramarine, like
gold and silver leaf,

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.770
was reserved for deluxe codices,
and only highly trained artists

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.980
were entrusted with its care.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.930
Anita Radini, an archaeologist
at the University

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.360
of York in England and the
study's principal investigator

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.820
was initially dumbfounded
by the discovery.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.780
She consulted archaeologists,
anthropologists, biologists,

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.020
and historians with
relevant expertise

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.520
to assess the significance
of her findings.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.940
They determined that the
most likely explanation

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.550
for the presence of
the ultramarine pigment

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.610
in the nuns teeth
was either that she

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.090
was an illuminator in her
community's scriptorium

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.930
who used to lick her
brush to make a fine point

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.780
or that she was
responsible for preparing

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.840
the pigments for her
own use and/or the use

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.560
of other illuminations
in her community.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.890
If true, these
conclusions present

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.640
another significant challenge
to the long held assumption

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.830
that monks rather than nuns were
the primary producers of books

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.380
throughout the Middle Ages.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.800
Moreover, the research
methods employed in the study

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.440
offer a new approach
to recovering

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.820
the histories of medieval nuns
in their lived totalities.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.820
As the investigators
note, identifying

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.339
the early contributions
of religious women

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:21.890
to medieval book
production, especially

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.770
before the 12th
century, is challenging

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.890
due to the limited number
of surviving books,

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.580
the precarious documentation
of women's communities,

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.320
and the tendency of scribes
to leave their works unsigned.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.390
Among books in women's monastic
libraries, fewer than 15%

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.440
bear the names of
women or titles.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.400
And before the 12th century
fewer than 1% of books

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.140
can be attributed to women.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.610
As a result, individual female
scribes remain poorly visible

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.460
in the historical
record, and it is likely

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.440
that most of their scribal
work has gone unrecognized.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.720
Thanks to the efforts
of these investigators,

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.620
the artistic and literary
contributions of medieval nuns

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.660
are now receiving
the public attention

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.830
they so richly deserve.

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.950
On the very day when
Science Advances published

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.800
the investigators
article, it was picked up

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.360
by major news outlets from
CNN to The New York Times

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.550
to NPR to the Atlantic.

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.760
And within 24 hours
of the news breaking,

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.200
I received excited emails from
my fellow Red Cliff fellows

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:43.660
and also staff at the institute
with links to these articles.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.640
Of course, I was delighted to
see that this discovery was

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.400
generating so much interest.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.160
But I must confess
that like medievalists

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.920
who were following the
story, including some

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.710
of the investigators
behind the study,

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.500
I was also frustrated by
some of the headlines.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.570
Particularly by
those that proclaimed

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.190
that this finding
had the potential

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.880
to rewrite the history
of medieval nuns

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.450
or that it was shedding light
on some long forgotten history

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.780
of these women.

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.920
Such proclamations outright
to conceal or ignore

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.350
the important research
that has been undertaken

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:28.520
over the past 30 years to
find evidence of nuns working

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.020
as artists and scribes.

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.110
Notable examples of such
efforts include the monographs

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.040
by Harvard's own Jeffrey
Hamburger in 1997

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.650
and by Allison Beach in 2004.

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:46.780
For many medievalists
then the discovery

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.140
of a medieval nun with
ultramarine pigment embedded

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:53.890
in the tartar of her
teeth was not surprising.

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:56.500
It presents new
archaeological methods

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.380
for providing further
proof of what is already

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.620
known about medieval nuns.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.640
These methods will undoubtedly
become indispensable additions

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.430
to the toolkit that
scholars have already

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:13.030
been using to identify
nuns' artistic and scribal

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.210
productions.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.940
The burden of proving
that nuns possess

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.970
the requisite literacies
and skills to undertake

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:26.340
such productions on their own
is still much, much higher

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.200
than it is for monks.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.800
And the existence of the remains
of a nun with ultramarine

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.200
in her teeth appears
to many to provide

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:39.690
the very concrete, credible,
nay irrefutable proof needed

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:43.900
to satisfy this
inequitable obligation.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.560
Old assumptions about
these women as uneducated

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:51.610
or illiterate or
unskilled die hard,

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:56.080
even among scholars who
should know better, but don't.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.040
Perhaps because of some sexist
preoccupation about the past

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:03.520
and possibly the present too.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.180
Recovering evidence that nuns
worked as scribes and artists

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:10.900
has always been an essential
facet of my research

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:14.700
on the liturgical practices
of their communities.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.280
In my forthcoming book,
which Meredith so graciously

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.680
introduced, The Care of Nuns--

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.720
The Ministries of
Benedictine Women in England

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.940
During the Central
Middle Ages, I

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:27.510
reconstruct the liturgical roles
that Benedictine women perform

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:32.159
from roughly 900 to 1200
through close palaeographical,

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:37.580
codicological, and textual
analysis of their extant books.

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:40.620
And in my current
project, Liturgy Matters,

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.830
Benedictine Women's Communities
in Medieval England,

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:46.350
I expand upon the
research of my first book

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:50.760
to examine more comprehensively
the materiality of Benedictine

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.430
nuns liturgical practices.

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:56.430
This turn to
materiality was inspired

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:59.010
by recent theorists
of religion who

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:03.660
have sought to understand
how and why humans choose,

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:06.720
transport, repurpose,
and consume

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.240
objects for sacred ends.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.310
They argue that
religionists are not

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:15.570
so much believers as
technologists, who transform

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:18.570
and are transformed
by select objects

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:21.160
through sensual engagement.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:25.750
Humans do not solely possess
the powers to speak, remind,

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:33.190
surprise, enchant, disgust,
heal, and harm, objects do too.

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:35.410
And scholars and
practitioners of religion

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:38.910
must reckon with their powers.

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:42.000
In my current book project,
I take up this charge

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.150
by reviewing medieval
nuns as technologists

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.610
through the objects
they created, acquired,

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:50.860
and treasured for
liturgical use.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:53.380
Most of these objects
no longer survive

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.960
due to their natural
ephemerality,

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:59.590
their inevitable obsolescence
through frequent use and ritual

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:03.670
innovation, or their
destruction, appropriation,

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:07.660
or migration during and after
Henry VIII's dissolution

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:11.620
of all religious houses in
England, Wales, and Ireland

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:15.240
between 1536 and 1540.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:19.890
Still, nuns liturgical
books supply important clues

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:23.550
for reconstructing,
even if only partially,

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:27.300
the features and uses
of these objects.

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:30.870
Nuns liturgical books
then are the sine qua non

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:32.310
of my research.

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:34.410
And not just because
of the limitations

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:37.920
posed by the surviving
material evidence,

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.950
but more importantly,
because these books served

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:45.030
as the primary matter
of nuns liturgies.

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:47.040
Without them, nuns
could not have

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:50.047
performed their daily
liturgical practices.

00:10:50.047 --> 00:10:51.630
It would have been
impossible for them

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:56.820
to remember all of the prayers,
readings, chants, and actions

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:59.010
that were proper to the masses.

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:01.560
Eight hours of sung
prayer that constituted

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.350
the divine office
and the other rituals

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:07.880
that they enacted
every single day.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.950
On account of the
indispensability

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:13.940
of books to nuns individual
and corporate realization

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:18.560
of their vocations as valid
religious precious materials

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:23.830
and extensive labor were often
dedicated to books production

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:26.960
and they were then stored
and used with great care

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:31.280
to ensure their
integrity and durability.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.830
Some books, depending
on the circumstances

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:36.410
surrounding their
making and handling,

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:39.320
were even venerated as relics.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:42.800
Prominently displayed on
the altars of nuns churches

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:47.620
or buried with cherished
members of the community.

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.170
All of the extent liturgical
books from communities

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:52.780
of Benedictine nuns
in medieval England

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:57.130
bear telling signs of their
production, circulation,

00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:02.020
and application from
marginalia to drops of wax.

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:05.530
Each book is a veritable
archaeological site

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:08.530
awaiting excavation.

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:12.250
The evidence unearthed must
be meticulously studied,

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:15.220
and as much as possible,
pieced together

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:18.160
like the tessarae of
a scattered mosaic

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.550
to try to reconstruct how nuns
fulfilled their obligations

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:24.700
to worship God, to
honor the Saints,

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:28.240
and to pray for themselves,
their fellow sisters,

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:32.130
and to those who were
entrusted to their care.

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:34.980
Such reconstructions
will invariably

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:40.480
be riddled with incongruities
and uncertainties and lacunae.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.690
This would be the case,
even if all the books ever

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:47.410
owned by Benedictine nuns in
medieval England still survived

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:50.170
for analysis,
because they present

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:54.880
scripts intended for recitation
in not verbatim records

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.860
of performance.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.650
And yet, given the current
state of the evidence

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:01.810
from their communities,
these scripts

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:04.120
offer the closest
witnesses that we

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.120
have to their
liturgical practices,

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:12.400
and thus, are privileged in
my history of those practices.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.470
For the remainder of
my talk this afternoon

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:17.320
I want to acquaint you
with three manuscripts that

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.530
continually prove to be
rich sites of evidence

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:23.980
for my research, but have
received surprisingly little

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.710
attention from other scholars.

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:28.540
All of these
manuscripts were owned

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:31.840
by communities of Benedictine
nuns in medieval England.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.910
And, as I will
demonstrate, they all

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:37.030
feature the handiwork
of female scribes

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:41.380
in their initial production
and/or subsequent adaptation,

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:45.550
even though they variously date
to the 11th and 12th centuries,

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:47.950
the very upper limit
of the temporal span

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:51.010
that scholars have determined
to be the most difficult

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:55.350
for identifying nuns
working as scribes.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:14:00.090
Thus, and focusing my remarks
today on these manuscripts,

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:02.700
I seek to highlight
the contributions,

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.730
my own contributions to the
growing body of evidence

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:08.550
advancing medieval
nuns literacies,

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:12.690
particularly their ability to
work as copyists, collectors,

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:15.780
and even group
composers of text.

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:19.440
To this end, I will not
proceed chronologically,

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.930
but for my most
secure attribution

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:24.210
to more probable ones.

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:28.290
Spoiler alert, I have not
exhumed the bodies of any nuns

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:31.560
with ink stained
teeth, but I am hoping

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.825
that my findings will
encourage archaeologists

00:14:33.825 --> 00:14:34.575
to go out digging.

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:40.840
The first manuscript now
held at the Bodleian Library

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.030
at the University of
Oxford under the shelf

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:46.630
marked Bodley 451 is a
book that was produced

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:49.570
in the early 12th
century at Nunnaminster,

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:53.410
or St. Mary's abbey in
Winchester for collation.

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:57.190
That is the evening gathering
of the entire monastic community

00:14:57.190 --> 00:15:01.360
in the cloister after
vespers and before compline

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.780
at which the abbess or
prioress read aloud selections

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:07.930
from the scriptures,
commentaries, or homilies

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:10.870
on the scriptural elections
of the day, Saints

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:14.320
lives, commentaries on
the Benedictine rule,

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:18.810
or an edifying word
of her own devising.

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:21.870
Nunnaminster had been
founded in around 900

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:26.250
near the seat of West Saxon
Royal Power in Winchester

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:29.970
at the initiative of Queen
Ealhswith, the widow of King

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:31.130
Alfred.

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:32.790
But its construction
was completed

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:36.960
by her son, Edward the Elder,
in the early years of his reign.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.570
One of Edward's
daughters, Eadburgha,

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:42.060
was given to the community
as a child oblate

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:43.890
at the age of three.

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:48.840
And upon her death, was buried
there and venerated as a Saint.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.790
Throughout its
history, which endured

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:54.710
until its dissolution
in 1539 by Henry VIII,

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:57.660
Nunnaminster enjoyed
generous benefactions

00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:00.840
of lands and movable
wealth for royalty

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.530
and high ranking nobility.

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:06.530
Beginning under the reign of
William I after the Norman

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:10.790
conquest of England in 1066,
the abbess of Nunnaminster

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:14.030
ranked as barren
ex-officio bearing

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:18.230
the responsibilities of
raising levees in times of war

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:21.580
and providing knight
service to the king.

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:24.880
Extent narrative sources attest
to the presence of a school

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:29.080
at the abbey, which educated
its members and other women

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.440
in its care to attain
high levels of literacy

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:35.020
in both reading and writing.

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:37.810
Bodley 451 provides
clear evidence

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:39.520
to support the claims
of these sources.

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:47.810
Bodley 451 contains Smaragdus
of Saint-Mihiel, Crown of Monks,

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:50.630
selections from Isidore
of Seville's, Three Books

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:55.760
of Sentences, a miscellany of
17 sermons mostly by Caesarius

00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:00.320
of Arles, but also by Augustine,
Pseudo-Augustine, Maximus

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:04.970
of Turin, and Peter Chrysologus,
and an account of a miracle

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:08.089
performed by Eadburgha, the
daughter of Edward the Elder

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:10.420
that I mentioned before.

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:12.700
Nearly the entirety
of the book was

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:16.810
copied by a single scribe,
who wrote an illegible Anglo

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:19.930
Caroline minuscule and
left generous space

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:22.089
between each line.

00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:25.089
The size and layout
of the page coupled

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:28.840
with the legibility of the
text made this book well suited

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.190
to public instruction.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.580
The addition of accent marks
and supplemental punctuation

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:40.660
by a later scribe would have
enhanced the text legibility.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:44.020
These additions occur
primarily in the 17 sermons

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:45.940
included in the book.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.950
Most of the sermons
are longer in length

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:51.040
than the chapters of either
Smaragdus' Crown of Monks

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.350
or Isidore sentences.

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:56.620
And some lectures may have
required additional performance

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:59.290
cues for the modulation
of their voice

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:02.740
to help make the readings more
intelligible to their audience.

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:07.420
So interrogative sentences that
originally ended in a punctus,

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:10.090
or a point indicating
a pause, were

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:13.450
changed to punctus
interrogative, or question

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:18.700
marks, again, to help the reader
know when to elevate her voice.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:22.990
But also, we see the addition
of punctus versus, which

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:26.260
look like semicolons,
which help to set off

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:29.200
a quotation from
scripture or when

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.940
the speaker is
supposed to assume

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:34.530
a voice for rhetorical effect.

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:38.970
Gibbet paragraph marks were
also inserted into a few texts

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:42.810
probably to break the sermon
into smaller sense units

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:45.660
or to designate passages
of particular import

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:47.400
to the community.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:50.880
The paragraph marks
added on folio 98 verso

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.400
to one of Caesarius
of Arles sermons

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.310
on the preservation of
chastity and marriage

00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:59.010
suggests the latter
interpretation,

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:01.020
because they set off
a passage affirming

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:06.700
the equality that women share
with men in the life of faith.

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:09.400
What is worse is that
these things, that

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:12.580
is, acts of fornication
before marriage,

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:16.620
are committed by many men
without any fear of the Lord,

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:19.750
since they are dismissed
by many in custom,

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:23.920
and thus are said to be cheap
and trivial so that now they

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:27.110
are not thought to
be serious crimes.

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:29.050
But in the Catholic
faith, whatever

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:34.240
is not entirely permitted to
women is not permitted to men.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:38.650
For both men and women, too,
are redeemed with one price,

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:41.320
that is, with the
precious blood of Christ.

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:44.840
In one faith they are called,
and in one body of the church

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:47.310
they are gathered.

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:50.190
Caesarius' admonition that
the demands and rewards

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:53.430
of the life of faith were
the same for both sexes

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:56.940
offered a salutary
message to women,

00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:00.970
irrespective of their
vocation in the church.

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:04.690
The nuns at Nunnaminster may
have welcomed this message,

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:08.050
not only for themselves but
also for the other lady that

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:11.702
were in their pastoral care.

00:20:11.702 --> 00:20:14.120
The lectors of
Bodley 451 would have

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.610
been aided in the
location of specific texts

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:20.180
within the volume by consulting
the three tables of contents

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:22.220
included before
each of the three

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:24.800
main collections of texts.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.470
On the slide is the
first table of contents

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:32.870
listing the chapters in
Smaragdus' Crown of Monks.

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:35.570
Page markers in
the forms of loops

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:38.510
of thread sewn into
the margins of the book

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:41.120
may have also helped to
aid in the quick location

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.070
of certain texts.

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:45.440
One such page marker
in purple thread

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:49.820
can still be found in the
bottom margin on folio 34 verso

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:53.720
where chapter 42 of
Smaragdus' Crown on the zeal

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:56.600
a pastoral office begins.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:59.630
This page marker occurs at
a relative halfway point

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:02.570
in the 100 chapters
of the Crown.

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:06.170
But its addition may also
reflect the pastoral concerns

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:09.290
or devotional interests
of Nunnaminster's abbess

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:09.850
or prioress.

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:16.670
We can deduce that
Bodley 451 was likely

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:20.060
used for the instruction of the
community at evening collation

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:22.100
on the basis of its contents.

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:26.060
12th century lists of
collation from monastic houses

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:29.060
often included
Isidore sentences.

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:32.420
And in the prologue to his
Crown of Monks Smaragdus

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:35.690
explicitly stated that the text
was to serve as a companion

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:38.270
to the Benedictine
rule, recommending

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:40.280
that a chapter from
it be read daily

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.920
at collation to supplement
the reading from the rule

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:43.785
at morning chapter.

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:50.960
The presence of drops of wax
and wax stains on several

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:55.210
of Bodley 451's folio suggests
that Smaragdus' recommendation

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:58.400
for his text was
followed at Nunnaminster.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.450
And so what seems clear
is that these drops of wax

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:05.470
indicate that the lector
brought the candle to--

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:08.380
brought the book too close to
a candle and that drops of wax

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:10.019
were then spilled on the page.

00:22:10.019 --> 00:22:11.560
And this is likely
because the lector

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:14.770
was reading in a dimly
lit space or at evening.

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:22.770
Quite remarkably, the
main scribe of Bodley 451

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:27.000
included a colophon
on folio 119 verso,

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.140
immediately following
the final sermon.

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:33.570
Such scribal colophons
are very uncommon

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:35.670
before the 15th century.

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:38.520
But in this one the
scribe identified herself

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:43.650
as a scriptricks beseeching
her readers, save the scribe

00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:47.120
and may she remain
unharmed forever.

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:50.390
This plea offers the
most unequivocal evidence

00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:53.150
that we have that at least
one nun at Nunnaminster

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:57.640
was working as a scribe
in the early 12th century.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:01.690
But there is another hand
who made marginal additions

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:05.710
to several folios around the
same time as the main scribe.

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:07.720
These additions
primarily consist

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:12.070
of alphabet trials and various
inscriptions, prayer verses

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:15.970
and lines from sermons on the
folios where they were copied.

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:18.460
The appearance and
content of these additions

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:22.120
suggest that they were made by
an inexperienced hand, perhaps

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:25.920
a student in the abbey school.

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.990
I must admit that
I am particularly

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:31.920
charmed by the repetition of the
verse from Virgil's Eclogues--

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.720
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.840
Love conquers all,
once in conjunction

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:40.980
with the opening line from
the Hail Mary, Ave Maria.

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.320
When I first saw
this coincidence,

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:46.572
I couldn't help but think of
Chaucer's Canterbury Tales

00:23:46.572 --> 00:23:48.030
and the description
of the prioress

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:51.150
in the general prologue.

00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:54.030
About her arm she bore a small--

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:56.850
bore of small coral
a set of beads,

00:23:56.850 --> 00:23:59.370
adorned with large green beads.

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:02.910
And there on hung a
brooch of very bright gold

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:06.920
on which there was written
an A with a crown and after

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:10.150
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:13.010
Evidently, the nuns of early
12th century Nunnaminster

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:16.030
weren't all that different
from those satirized by Chaucer

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:17.980
in the late 14th century.

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:20.860
And for those of you who haven't
had the opportunity of looking

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:24.610
at this gorgeous manuscript copy
of the Canterbury Tales known

00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:26.980
as the Ellesmere
Chaucer, which includes

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:29.200
figures of the different
pilgrims on their way

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:30.007
to Canterbury.

00:24:30.007 --> 00:24:31.840
I just have to note
that the one illuminator

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:33.820
responsible for the
prioress' portrait

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:40.000
did include the beads on her
wrist, which is just wonderful.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.800
So the second manuscript I
wish to discuss this afternoon

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:46.460
is an 11th century gospel book
from Barking Abbey now held

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:52.910
at the Bodleian Library under
the shelf marked Bodley 155.

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:56.090
The remains of this community
are located just over 10 miles

00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:58.340
east of central London.

00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:01.640
Barking was the only community
of Benedictine nuns in England

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.530
that claimed a
continuous history

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:06.670
from its initial foundation
by Ethelburga and her brother

00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:11.170
Earconwald in around 670
through to its surrender

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:16.540
to Henry VIII's commissioner
on November the 14th, 1539.

00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:19.600
And though the abbey's church
cloister and surrounding

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.850
buildings were nearly
completely dismantled

00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:25.780
in the decades following its
dissolution, textual sources,

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:28.930
archaeological excavations,
and GIS mapping

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:30.970
have helped scholars
to reconstruct

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:33.430
the orientation,
dimensions and features

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:36.220
of the monastic precinct.

00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:38.650
Throughout its history,
Barking attracted the daughters

00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:42.780
of royalty, nobility, and
other luminaries as members.

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:46.180
In 1381, Elizabeth
Chaucer, probably

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:49.630
a daughter of Geoffrey Chaucer,
made her religious profession

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:51.400
at the abbey.

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:55.360
Barking was located just a mile
away from St. Leonard's Priory

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.820
in Stratford, the community
led by Chaucer's prioress

00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:01.580
in his Canterbury Tales.

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:04.610
Since the reign of William
I, Barking's abbess,

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:09.020
like Nunnaminsters, ranked
as barren ex-officio.

00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:12.170
And at its dissolution
in 1539, Barking

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:14.240
was the third
wealthiest community

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.590
of religious women in England.

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:21.500
Bodley 155 is the only
complete gospel book

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:24.560
to survive from an Abbey or
Priory of Benedictine nuns

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:26.270
in medieval England.

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:28.850
It presents a unique
source of evidence

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:32.930
for examining nun's scribal
and liturgical practices,

00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:36.260
because through various types
of correction and additions

00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:40.750
it was thoroughly adapted
for public recitation.

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:44.770
These alterations have not
received scholarly attention.

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:47.020
Yet, when
systematically studied,

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:49.510
they offer rich insight
into the history

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:53.400
of the manuscripts production
and use at Barking.

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:56.230
The many interlinear
and marginal corrections

00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:58.360
and additions made
to the book supply

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:01.780
missing narrative details,
alternative readings

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:04.690
for ambiguous
pronouns and phrases,

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:08.500
pronunciation guides,
supplemental punctuation,

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:12.790
neumes and other vocal
cues like passion letters.

00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:15.850
They all indicate that it was
produced and then adapted,

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:18.370
not for private
devotional reading

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:21.730
but for communal
liturgical proclamation.

00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:24.400
The scribes responsible
for its making

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:26.200
attended to the
demands of performance

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:29.650
on both lectors and
auditors by fashioning

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:35.800
a text that could announce the
good news solemnly and clearly.

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:38.680
The wax stains on many
of the book's folios

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:40.840
suggests that it was
used for the gospel

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:45.310
reading at the evening office
of matinees on Sundays and feast

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:48.100
days by the abbess of
Barking in accordance

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:50.740
with the dictates of
the Benedictine rule.

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:52.480
Due to dim lighting,
she probably

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:55.570
brought the book too close to a
candle, which then spilled wax

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:56.125
on the page.

00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:02.100
Compared with earlier and
contemporary Anglo-Saxon gospel

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:05.190
books with respect to
both size and layout,

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:08.460
Bodley 155 is a typical
witness to the types

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:11.490
of books that were used
for liturgical reading.

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:14.640
It contains the texts of
all four gospels preceded

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:17.280
by their chapter
lists and prophecies,

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:19.740
except for Matthew's, and
that's because the manuscript

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:22.620
was mutilated at the beginning.

00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:25.930
At the books end there is a
capitulary detailing the gospel

00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:28.830
elections to be read on
different days of the week

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:32.380
and feast days throughout
the entire year.

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:34.780
The bulk of Bodley
155 was copied

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:38.500
by a single scribe writing
in the early 11th century,

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:40.660
an Anglo-Saxon minuscule.

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:43.240
But there were at least
seven other scribes

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:46.600
who worked on the production
and alteration of Bodley 155

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:49.600
in the 11th and
early 12th centuries.

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.460
The vast majority
of the alterations

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:54.230
were made by the main scribe
and a second scribe who

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:56.650
was writing an Anglo
Caroline minuscule not too

00:28:56.650 --> 00:28:58.450
long afterwards.

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:00.550
I have categorized
their alterations

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:04.120
according to three types,
identification of characters,

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:08.870
clarification of plot, and
guides to pronunciation.

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:11.240
An example of the first
type of alteration

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:14.290
can be found on folio 37 recto.

00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:16.430
In the inter linear
space above the verse

00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:20.570
from the gospel of Matthew,
then the pharisees departing

00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:23.540
formed a plan to
ensnare him in speech,

00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:29.090
the main scribe inserted
when you read, say, Jesus.

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:33.890
That is instead of saying the
pronoun [NON-ENGLISH],, or him,

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:37.440
say, [NON-ENGLISH], or Jesus.

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.420
This substitution
would have rendered

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:41.730
the gospel lection
more intelligible

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:44.160
to an auditor,
who may have not--

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.800
who may not have known
who the him the pharisees

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:49.680
wished to ensnare in speech was.

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:53.490
The insertion of Jesus provided
the necessary identification

00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:57.390
of the central
character in the scene.

00:29:57.390 --> 00:30:00.810
Another kind of scribble
alteration found in Bodley 155

00:30:00.810 --> 00:30:05.220
can be loosely grouped under the
rubric of plot clarifications.

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:08.220
These alterations were
made either inter-linearly

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:11.700
or marginally to certain
verses to provide more detail

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:15.090
to the gospel elections
for an auditor's benefit.

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:16.830
Mainly to give
greater definition

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:20.910
to a particular action or
object in a given scene.

00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:23.010
A clear example of
this type of alteration

00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:26.350
is found on folio 34 verso.

00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:31.060
The second scribe expuncted
the verb mansit, he remained,

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:33.460
from the Mathieson
verse, and leaving them

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:37.300
he went out of the city into
Bethany and remained there,

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:40.120
and inter-linearly
supplied a new reading

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:44.230
that provides greater
specificity to Jesus' actions.

00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:48.330
He was teaching them
about the Kingdom of God.

00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:51.090
Different, though no less
helpful in the aural fullness

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:52.770
of the gospel reading
are the addition

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:56.310
of pronunciation guides,
supplemental punctuation,

00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:59.810
animation, and passion letters.

00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:03.420
A fairly thoroughgoing
re-punctuation of Bodley 155

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:05.880
was undertaken by
three of the scribes,

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.730
mostly by the main
scribe and second scribe.

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:11.580
As you can see on the
slide, through both addition

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:14.160
and erasure, the
punctuation was altered,

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:16.920
likely to help a lector
to know when to pause

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:19.650
or to provide certain
vocal effects to a reading.

00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:21.810
And so here we're actually
in the gospel of Luke.

00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:25.080
And this is actually the
parable of the prodigal son.

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:28.350
And you can see that the punctus
interrogative is the question

00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:30.180
mark that was originally here.

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:33.600
The top part was erased
and then added down here.

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.930
So when the prodigal son
is thinking to himself--

00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:37.890
you know, my son--

00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:40.440
how many servants
does my father have

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:43.170
that are receiving bread
and more well-fed than I am

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:46.110
and I am famished, moved
the punctuation down here

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:49.942
to actually include that whole
quotation from the son that's

00:31:49.942 --> 00:31:51.150
thinking about that question.

00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:58.330
The clearest evidence of
Bodley's 155 intended use

00:31:58.330 --> 00:32:00.700
in the musical
declamation of the gospel

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:03.880
is the addition of
adiastematic neumes.

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:07.360
That is neumes that were
not written on staff lines

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:10.690
and therefore communicate
little pitch information.

00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:12.499
As you can see in the
example on the slide,

00:32:12.499 --> 00:32:14.290
such additions would
have helped the reader

00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:18.310
to align the melodic inflections
to the syllables of the text

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:21.690
as she intoned it.

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:24.690
Further indications of how the
gospels were to be proclaimed

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:27.590
were provided through the
additions of passion letters

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:31.380
to the gospels of
Matthew, Luke, and John.

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:32.970
As you can see on
the slide, which

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:36.120
features the opening of the
gospel of Matthew's passion,

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:38.070
the main scribe
inserted the letters

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:41.880
T and C in the
inter-linear space.

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:44.160
The meanings of these
letters were multiple

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:46.770
depending on time and
place and change over

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:48.900
the course of the Middle Ages.

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:52.110
But during the period
when Bodley 155 was copied

00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:56.550
and adapted, T often marked
Jesus' words and stood

00:32:56.550 --> 00:33:01.470
for, [NON-ENGLISH],, hold,
or, [NON-ENGLISH],, slowly,

00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:04.470
indicating that they should
be chanted with a lower voice

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:08.600
and at a slower speed than
the other speaking parts.

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:13.410
C marked the words of the
evangelists, Jesus' followers,

00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:17.760
Pilot, and the Jews, and stood
for [NON-ENGLISH],, quickly,

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:21.210
or, [NON-ENGLISH],, more quickly,
indicating that they should be

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:25.380
chanted with a higher voice
and at a faster speed.

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:28.110
Thus, these passion
letters signified

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:32.920
how the lector was to intone
the different speaking parts.

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:35.020
The foregoing
discussion has shown

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:37.660
that the scribal
interventions in Bodley 155

00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:40.300
transformed the gospels
into a script fit

00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:42.550
for liturgical performance.

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:45.280
What I have yet to establish
is whether the scribes

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:50.240
who made the various alterations
were nuns at Barking.

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:52.790
The most suggestive
evidence in support

00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:55.120
of an affirmative
answer to this question

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:57.590
is the addition made
by the second scribe

00:33:57.590 --> 00:34:02.060
on folio 167 recto to the
[INAUDIBLE] passage recalling

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:04.460
the raising of Lazarus.

00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:06.590
Next to the verse
describing the Jews

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:11.239
who visited Lazarus' sister Mary
to hear and see for themselves

00:34:11.239 --> 00:34:14.480
the miracle Jesus had
worked the second scribe

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:18.020
included the seemingly
absent Martha in the scene

00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:24.050
by supplying et martham, and
Martha, in the outer margin.

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:26.179
At first glance,
such an addition

00:34:26.179 --> 00:34:29.900
may seem unsurprising, given
that Martha is repeatedly

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:32.690
mentioned in the
preceding verses,

00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:35.060
but she rarely makes
such an appearance

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:38.630
in extant bibles, gospel
books, and lectionaries

00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:43.489
produced earlier than or
contemporary with Bodley 155.

00:34:43.489 --> 00:34:45.350
The rarity of this
reading, thus,

00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:48.530
begs the question
whence the inspiration

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:51.449
for the second scribes edition.

00:34:51.449 --> 00:34:55.889
As Giles Constable has
shown, Martha and Mary

00:34:55.889 --> 00:34:59.850
served as potent figures of both
the active and contemplative

00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:03.240
lives for lay and
religious of both sexes

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:06.660
in the patristic and medieval,
theological, liturgical and

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:08.880
artistic traditions.

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:12.720
Yet, in medieval England,
Barking was especially

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:15.000
devoted to Martha.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.540
Among extant liturgical books
from Benedictine communities,

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:20.550
Martha's liturgical
veneration was

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:23.790
noted in only one,
the calendar opening

00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:27.390
Barking's early 15th
century ordinal, which lists

00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:30.940
her commemoration on July 29th.

00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:34.330
The addition of Martha to the
account of her brothers raising

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:37.930
then seems to inscribe
the liturgical practices

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:41.170
of a particular community
and the devotional interests

00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:45.230
of a scribe fully embedded
within that community.

00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:48.310
It may just reveal the
hand of a nun trained

00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:52.670
in informed by Barking's
[INAUDIBLE] prayer.

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:54.650
But we also know
of a Barking nun

00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:58.010
who was operative as a
scribe during the very time

00:35:58.010 --> 00:36:00.890
that Bodley 155 was produced.

00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:02.890
In his [? lives of
Barking's abbesses,

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:06.800
?] Ethelburga and Wolfhilde,
Goscelin of Saint-Bertin,

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:11.090
the renowned peripatetic Flemish
hagiographer of English Saints

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:14.780
writing in the second half of
the 11th century repeatedly

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:18.680
mentioned a woman named
Wulfruna Judith who was a member

00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:21.500
of the community during
Wolfhilde's abbessy in the late

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:24.920
10th century, but lived
well into the second half

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:26.920
of the 11th.

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:31.210
Wulfruna Judith not only served
as the abbey sacristan helping

00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:33.610
to organize the
community's liturgies,

00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:35.900
but also as a scribe.

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:38.980
So memorable were her
deeds as a scriptricks

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:43.090
that Gosselin deemed it fitting
to remember her as such.

00:36:43.090 --> 00:36:45.760
In his life of
Ethelbruga, Gosselin

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:49.870
recalled the story of the
infamous theft and miraculous

00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:54.070
recovery of a missile that
Wulfruna Judith had copied.

00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:55.630
For those who don't
know, a missile

00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:57.400
is a type of
liturgical book that

00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:01.150
contains all of the texts
needed to celebrate the masses

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:03.740
throughout the entire year.

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:08.420
The Barking community treasured
Wulfruna Judith's missile,

00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:10.970
prominently displaying
it on the altar dedicated

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:13.700
to its founder,
Ethelburga, because it

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:17.930
was the abbey's optimus
codex, or best book

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:21.950
according to Gosselin, who must
have seen and handled the book

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:25.100
himself during his
time at Barking.

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:28.100
There is no explicit
evidence in Bodley 155

00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:31.070
that would allow us to
identify Wulfruna Judith as one

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:34.580
of the scribes behind the
book's production and adaptation

00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:36.560
for liturgical use.

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:40.700
However, as a scribe active
in copying liturgical books

00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:44.720
at barking and as an officer
instrumental to the community's

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.940
liturgies, she
certainly would have

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:51.270
been capable of
performing such tasks.

00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:53.730
The third and final manuscript
that I wish to acquaint you

00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:55.120
with this afternoon--

00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:58.000
I'll be a bit more briefly
than the preceding two--

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.860
is a 12th century Psalter
once owned by Wherwell Abbey,

00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:03.990
but now preserved in
special collections

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:06.390
in the library of
St. John's College

00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:08.220
at the University of Cambridge.

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:11.540
It's manuscript C 18.

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:14.240
Wherwell was located in
the county of Hampshire,

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:17.330
about 10 miles Northwest
of Nunnaminster.

00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:20.060
The abbey was founded
in around the year 1000

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:24.670
by Queen Elfthryth, the
third wife of King Edgar.

00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:28.100
A charter later issued by
her son King Ethelred II

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:30.800
credits her with possessing
and diligently building up

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:33.440
the abbey while she was alive.

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:35.990
An unnamed daughter of
Ethelred's was the abbess

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:38.550
of the house in the
mid 11th century.

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:42.260
In 1051, her brother
King Edward the Confessor

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:45.830
had his wife Edith
imprisoned at the abbey.

00:38:45.830 --> 00:38:49.100
In 1141, Wherwell's
fortunes were nearly

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:52.760
completely devastated when at
the height of the Civil War

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:55.760
between King Stephen
and Empress Matilda

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:58.460
the former's troops
set fire to the church

00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:01.310
where the community
had sought refuge.

00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:05.150
It would take nearly 50 years
for the abbey to recover fully

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:07.030
from this event.

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:10.180
Instrumental to the reversal
in Wherwell's fortunes

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:13.630
were the efforts of Matilda
[INAUDIBLE],, a young widow

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:15.970
and daughter of a
Flemish lord who

00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:21.850
ruled as abbess of the community
from around 1174 to 1212.

00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:25.060
None of the abbey's
buildings still stand today.

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:27.610
They were destroyed after
Henry VIII's dissolution

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:31.340
of the community in 1539.

00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:35.180
One of the few artifacts to
survive from abbess Matilda's

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:38.360
tenure in office
is this psalter,

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:40.820
which includes an opening
prayer for an abbess

00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:44.030
to use to consecrate the
offering of the songs,

00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:48.230
a calendar, the first 14
verses of the Gospel of John,

00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:51.230
the psalter proper
beginning imperfectly,

00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:54.670
the biblical canticles,
creeds, and our father,

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:57.770
a litany with
petitions, 50 prayers,

00:39:57.770 --> 00:40:01.820
including 4 to the Trinity, a
little office of the Virgin,

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:04.160
and an office of the dead.

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:07.400
At least 19 different
scribes were

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:09.890
operative in the
making of this psalter,

00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:13.010
beginning with the two who
copied the calendar, songs,

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:15.290
and prayers in a
Romanesque script

00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:20.310
sometime in the late
1160s or early 1170s.

00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:24.120
Once the psalter was in abbess
Matilda's possession, most

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:28.740
likely when she became abbess
of Wherwell in around 1174,

00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:32.520
another scribe also writing
in Romanesque script

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:35.220
added this prayer of
confession for an abbess

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:38.520
on two [? bifolia ?] that
were inserted into the ante

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:41.160
penultimate choir.

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:45.480
This same scribe also altered
some of the grammatical forms

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:48.810
in the preceding prayers so
that it scripted a woman instead

00:40:48.810 --> 00:40:50.890
of a man as its supplicant.

00:40:50.890 --> 00:40:53.280
And actually you can see
the changes made here.

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:56.220
So these two
adjectives originally

00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:58.860
ended in masculine
endings and they were

00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:00.510
changed to feminine endings.

00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:03.790
And actually, so forceful
was the corrector to the text

00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:05.790
that there's actually a
little hole that you can

00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:10.080
detect right behind the A here.

00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:12.630
In the early 13th century,
a different scribe

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:16.050
added to the opening fly
leaf, a prayer for an abbess

00:41:16.050 --> 00:41:19.740
to say prior to
reciting all 150 psalms

00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:22.400
as an intercessory offering.

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:25.190
And on two [? bifolia ?]
appended to the book

00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:27.950
this scribe copied an
office of the dead,

00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:30.230
a ritual of remembrance
that supplemented

00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:36.100
the hours of sung prayer at
vespers, matinees, and lauds.

00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:39.160
And on May 11th of the calendar,
which actually is my birthday

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:42.640
too, which is another
thing, this scribe

00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:46.360
recorded the obituary of
Matilda's maternal uncle, Osto

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:50.320
de Saint-Omer, who was
also a Flemish descent,

00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:51.880
but that had
traveled around much

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:55.150
of Western Europe and the
Levant as a member, then

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:59.620
provincial master, and finally
a worthy of the Knights Templar

00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:02.890
until his death in around 1174.

00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:05.110
In a forthcoming
article in speculum,

00:42:05.110 --> 00:42:07.660
I make the case for
Osto's patronage

00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:10.900
in ownership of the psalter
before it was given to Matilda.

00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:15.880
The 15 other scribes
who made editions

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:19.720
to the psalter at various times
throughout the 13th century

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:22.600
entered in the calendar
additional Saint's feast days

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:26.350
and obituaries of relatives,
community members,

00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:28.840
and veiled religious and
clerics in Wherwell's

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:30.620
spiritual network.

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:33.250
As you can see on the
slide, the death anniversary

00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:36.970
of abbess Matilda was
added on December 13th

00:42:36.970 --> 00:42:40.910
sometime after
her death in 1212.

00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:43.670
There isn't conclusive
evidence within the psalter

00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:46.520
itself to prove that some
of the nuns of Wherwell

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:50.540
were responsible for making the
various alterations to the book

00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:53.990
after it came into abbess
Matilda's possession.

00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:56.390
However, there is
additional evidence

00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:59.090
from the abbey that
indicates that the nuns there

00:42:59.090 --> 00:43:05.410
were capable of creating
original literary compositions.

00:43:05.410 --> 00:43:08.290
On the final folio of a
liturgical calendar that

00:43:08.290 --> 00:43:11.620
was owned by Wherwell
by the late 12th century

00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:14.650
11 elegiac couplets
commemorating the death

00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:17.490
of abbess Matilda were copied.

00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:20.100
These couplets offer
an important witness

00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:22.590
to the literary skills of
the community's members

00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:26.520
in the early 13th century,
because these verses were most

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:30.060
likely copied by one of
Matilda's fellow sisters,

00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:33.210
perhaps by her niece and
successor Euphemia de

00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:34.620
[INAUDIBLE].

00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:38.910
The 7th through 9th
couplets read, "Matilda,

00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:41.090
by disposition a
mother, by merits

00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:46.700
a matron, although not a virgin
by flesh, she was a virago.

00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:49.140
Married to a man without
the offspring of men,

00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:52.480
she sent him ahead, and
laboring for Christ,

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:55.320
she became a parent in duty.

00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:58.410
A jewel of her people,
and a woman in sex

00:43:58.410 --> 00:44:03.550
only, in habits and merits
she was completely manly.

00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:07.480
Flanders truly gave her birth,
England, rule, Wherwell,

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:11.970
an end, one faithful
to see God."

00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:15.120
If the nuns of Wherwell
could craft compositions

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:17.460
like this Latin
poem, then they would

00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:19.380
have possessed the
level of literacy

00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:24.170
necessary to make the various
alterations to the psalter.

00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:29.960
To conclude, liturgy mattered
to communities of Benedictine

00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:32.510
nuns-- literacy did too, that's
what I was wanting to say,

00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:34.460
throughout the Middle Ages.

00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:36.440
For the vast
majority of every day

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:39.380
their time was spent
engaged in praying the eight

00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:43.040
hours of the divine
office, celebrating masses,

00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:46.370
and performing the rituals
proper to a given feast,

00:44:46.370 --> 00:44:49.620
day of the week, or
change in the community,

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:51.980
such as the profession
of a new member,

00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:55.910
the death of an established
one, or the elevation in office

00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:58.890
or sanctity of a treasured one.

00:44:58.890 --> 00:45:00.870
Keeping time in this way.

00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:03.550
Heeding the steady
rhythm of the days,

00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:07.590
months, seasons, and years
of the liturgical calendar

00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:09.780
form the identities
of the nuns who

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:14.560
observed it, both as
individuals and as a collective.

00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:16.570
Essential to the
process of formation

00:45:16.570 --> 00:45:19.150
in a particular community
were the prayers and readings

00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:22.330
they recited, the
chants they intoned,

00:45:22.330 --> 00:45:25.000
the other sounds
they made and heard,

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.580
the spaces they moved
through and into

00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:32.050
and animated and the objects
they saw, war, handled,

00:45:32.050 --> 00:45:35.320
consumed, venerated,
transformed, and were

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:38.100
in turn transformed by.

00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:41.040
Scholars interested in
studying Benedictine nuns

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:44.880
must first, to endeavor, to
recompose the communal ritual

00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:49.860
practices to which these women
daily committed themselves.

00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:52.200
And they must do so
through the very books

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:55.830
they produced and used,
because these objects were

00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:58.590
the primary matter
of their liturgies.

00:45:58.590 --> 00:45:59.730
Thank you very much.

00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:01.830
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:05.180
