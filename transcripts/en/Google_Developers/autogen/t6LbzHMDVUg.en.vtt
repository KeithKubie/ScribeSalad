like a couple bodies of text but then
 

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:19.280
like a couple bodies of text but then
eventually and then learned more and

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:19.290
eventually and then learned more and
 

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:23.390
eventually and then learned more and
more through the internet like I like my

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:23.400
more through the internet like I like my
 

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.860
more through the internet like I like my
website progressed and of course it's

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:24.870
website progressed and of course it's
 

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:26.420
website progressed and of course it's
not published or anything cuz I just

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:26.430
not published or anything cuz I just

but it was a like that's how I got into

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:33.240
but it was a like that's how I got into
 

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.210
but it was a like that's how I got into
coding was by I go on and have this

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:35.220
coding was by I go on and have this
 

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:37.940
