00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.420
Let us suppose that the A agent has prior knowledge of these four concepts.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.620
A brick, a glass, a bowl,

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.080
and a briefcase. Let us look at one of these concepts in detail. So

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.001
the brick is stable because the bottom is flat. And a brick is heavy. So first,

00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:21.650
this particular conceptual characterization has several parts. About stability

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.710
and about heaviness. Second, there is also something about causality here.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.190
The brick is stable because its bottom is flat. This is an important element of

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.020
the brick, and similar things occur in the other four concepts.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.610
Let us now consider how an AI agent might be able to represent all of

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.070
this knowledge about a brick. Here is a visual rendering of this representation.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.710
First, the A agent knows about a lot facts about the brick. So a brick is heavy.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.310
The brick has a bottom and the bottom is flat. That comes from the second part

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.380
of the first sentence. Bottom is flat. And also that the brick is stable. So

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.290
here are some observable facts and this is a property of the brick. So this is

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.272
part of the structure of the brick. This is part of its function. In addition,

00:01:03.272 --> 00:01:07.260
the A agent knows that the brick is stable because the bottom is flat. So

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.450
we need to capture this notion of causality. So this yellow arrows here,

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.010
are intended to capture this notion of causality. The AI agent knows that

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.725
the brick is stable because the brick has a bottom and the bottom is flat. And

00:01:20.725 --> 00:01:24.819
this way, it connects these structural features into these factional features,

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:28.620
to these causal connections. To take another example, here is

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.125
a conceptual characterization of a briefcase and here is it's knowledge for

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:35.130
representation. I'll not go through this in great detail, but

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.825
briefly, a briefcase is liftable because it has a handle and it is light.

00:01:38.825 --> 00:01:42.950
And it is useful because it contains papers. Notice the notion of

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.936
causality here again. Once again there're these facts about the briefcase, for

00:01:46.936 --> 00:01:50.141
example the briefcase is portable, the briefcase has a handle, you know,

00:01:50.141 --> 00:01:53.266
these structural observable features. And then there is

00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:57.084
this functional features like briefcase is useful and briefcase is liftable. And

00:01:57.084 --> 00:02:01.310
then we have these yellow arrows denoting the causal connections between them.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.720
Similarly for the bowl, here is its conceptual characterization and

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.720
the knowledge representation. So the bowl contains cherry soup that one of

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.680
the fact here. The bowl is concave, that's another fact here and

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.900
it is a causal relationship here. It carries liquid because it is concave.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.642
Finally the fourth concept the A agent knows about, a glass. And a glass

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:26.470
enables drinking because it carries liquid and it is liftable, and it is pretty.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.927
So the glass is pretty. The glass carries liquids. It is liftable. And the fact

00:02:30.927 --> 00:02:36.750
that it enables drinking is because of these two other facts. Note quickly

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.160
that not all these structural features participate in this causal explanation.
