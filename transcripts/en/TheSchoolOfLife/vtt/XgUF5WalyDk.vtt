00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:06.333
♪[Music]♪

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:36.833
 

00:00:36.833 --> 00:00:42.099
[Applause]

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.800
[Carol] It’s a tremendous pleasure being here with  
you today in Conway Hall.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.966
I’d like to start with a question.

00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:53.232
Can a person be perfect?

00:00:53.233 --> 00:00:57.466
Well, speaking from personal experience, yes.

00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:59.932
[Laughter]

00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:03.566
As a child, I was perfect.

00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:08.866
I was perfectly good at least outwardly.

00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:12.599
Inwardly I had a lot of mischievous thoughts.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.966
I was perfectly smart.

00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:19.899
I was always at the top of my class.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:28.433
This I believed would ensure respect from others 
as well as high self-regard.

00:01:28.433 --> 00:01:38.933
If I ever considered easing up, something would 
come along to underscore the importance of 
being perfect.

00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:48.166
For example, my sixth grade teacher Mrs. Wilson 
seated us around the room in IQ order.

00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:54.399
[Laughter]

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:01.300
It was already the top IQ class in the school, but 
she didn’t care.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.866
For her, every point of IQ was incredibly 
important.

00:02:06.866 --> 00:02:15.432
The lower IQ children were not allowed to wash 
the blackboard or clap the erasers in the

00:02:15.433 --> 00:02:22.966
schoolyard or carry the flag in the assembly, take 
a note to the school principal.

00:02:22.966 --> 00:02:30.699
For her, your score summarized everything about 
your intelligence and character.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.766
How could you not be affected by that?

00:02:33.766 --> 00:02:42.432
I was so perfect that I had to start shrinking my 
world to maintain it.

00:02:42.433 --> 00:02:48.266
In grade school, I was the best speller in the 
school.

00:02:48.266 --> 00:02:54.932
And they wanted to send me to the regional 
championship spelling bee.

00:02:54.933 --> 00:02:57.499
I said "no".

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:10.100
The next year, I was the best student of French in 
the school and they wanted to send me to a 
citywide competition.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.700
I said "no".

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.933
Why would I put myself at risk?

00:03:14.933 --> 00:03:16.833
I was already perfect.

00:03:16.833 --> 00:03:22.999
And I had to curate that perfection.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:33.633
Now perhaps if life were one large schoolroom, it 
would be okay to stay perfect, try to stay perfect.

00:03:33.633 --> 00:03:36.899
But life isn’t like that.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:48.066
It changes radically and it begins to reward taking 
on challenges, seizing opportunities and sticking 
with them.

00:03:48.066 --> 00:03:55.199
My charge today is to speak about a vice or a 
virtue.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.366
Is perfectionism a vice or a virtue?

00:03:59.366 --> 00:04:08.399
Pam Scott, a friend and colleague surveyed 
adults asking them to answer the following 
question.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.900
Am I a perfectionist?

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.833
How would you answer that?

00:04:13.833 --> 00:04:24.699
On this survey, many, many people said yes, but 
there were two very different kinds of yes.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.566
So listen to this.

00:04:27.566 --> 00:04:31.932
Am I a perfectionist?

00:04:31.933 --> 00:04:38.466
One person said “I want to get it perfect the first 
time everytime.

00:04:38.466 --> 00:04:44.999
“My inner critic is constant, it is my judge, my 
warden.”

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:58.633
Or in the same vein another person said, “having 
built a magnificent dam of perfection, I am 
perpetually plugging all the holes.

00:04:58.633 --> 00:05:02.133
“It’s tiring, depleting.

00:05:02.133 --> 00:05:14.333
“It’s about fear of chaos and anxiety that what is 
is not good enough and that I am not good 
enough.”

00:05:14.333 --> 00:05:17.633
But now listen to this, this is a little bit different.

00:05:17.633 --> 00:05:20.799
Am I a perfectionist?

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.233
This person says “I do believe it serves a 
purpose.

00:05:26.233 --> 00:05:28.899
“It got me where I am today.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.400
“I am known for high standards and excellent 
work.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.900
“Why would I ever give up this excellent tool?”

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:43.633
So sometimes it sounds like a vice and 
sometimes it sounds like a virtue.

00:05:43.633 --> 00:05:47.333
What does the research say?

00:05:47.333 --> 00:05:53.133
The research says there might be two different 
kinds of perfectionism.

00:05:53.133 --> 00:06:05.166
One kind of perfectionist agrees with statements 
like this “people will probably think less of me if I 
make a mistake.

00:06:05.166 --> 00:06:11.566
“If I do not do well all the time, people won’t 
respect me.

00:06:11.566 --> 00:06:19.432
“If I fail partly, it is as bad as being a complete 
failure.”

00:06:19.433 --> 00:06:32.766
But the other kind of perfectionist, they say 
agrees with statements like this “I try to do my 
best in everything I do.

00:06:32.766 --> 00:06:37.566
“I drive myself rigorously to achieve high 
standards.

00:06:37.566 --> 00:06:42.299
“I have a strong need to strive for excellence.”

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:50.233
So this kind involves setting and striving toward 
very high standards.

00:06:50.233 --> 00:06:55.233
And later we’ll ask if perfectionism is the best 
word for that.

00:06:55.233 --> 00:06:57.099
 

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:02.900
The first, that self-critical kind has many negative 
consequences.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:08.566
Anxiety, depression, compromised relationships.

00:07:08.566 --> 00:07:15.666
But the second kind, striving for excellence, can 
have many positive consequences.

00:07:15.666 --> 00:07:20.366
Not only higher achievement, but greater life 
satisfaction.

00:07:20.366 --> 00:07:29.832
How do we understand where that defensive, self-
critical part comes from?

00:07:29.833 --> 00:07:43.033
That idea that I want to get it perfect the first time 
and every time as opposed to the more inspiring 
striving for high standards.

00:07:43.033 --> 00:07:55.666
To understand this, let’s look at my work on 
mindsets and let’s listen for the fixed mindsets 
mandate for perfection.

00:07:55.666 --> 00:07:57.766
 

00:07:57.766 --> 00:08:07.299
In this research, I identify two kinds of mindsets 
people can have about their basic talents and 
abilities.

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:15.866
In a fixed mindset, people believe that their basic 
attributes are well fixed.

00:08:15.866 --> 00:08:25.232
The talents, abilities and personal qualities they 
have now, that’s all they're ever gonna have.

00:08:25.233 --> 00:08:31.599
They keep asking “is what I have enough?

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.433
“Is it enough to make me admirable?

00:08:34.433 --> 00:08:36.633
“Is it enough to make me worthy?”

00:08:36.633 --> 00:08:40.199
This is what they’re always wondering.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:44.100
But other people have a growth mindset.

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:56.833
They believe that their basic talents, abilities, 
personal attributes can be developed through 
effort, learning, mentoring from others.

00:08:56.833 --> 00:09:03.899
What they have now is just a starting point.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:11.533
Now, they don’t necessarily believe that 
everyone’s the same or that anyone can be 
Einstein.

00:09:11.533 --> 00:09:16.566
But they believe that everyone can grow and 
develop.

00:09:16.566 --> 00:09:24.599
Let’s look into these mindsets to see exactly how 
they work.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:31.100
First, what is the number one goal for people in 
the different mindsets?

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.833
When we ask people this question.

00:09:34.833 --> 00:09:42.166
In school, at work, in their relationships, those 
with the fixed mindset say that their number one

00:09:42.166 --> 00:09:50.632
goal is to look and feel extremely accomplished 
at all times.

00:09:50.633 --> 00:09:57.199
But above all, never to feel dumb or inadequate.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:01.966
Students say this “I like school work best.”

00:10:01.966 --> 00:10:11.199
Students in a fixed mindset say this “I like school 
work best when I can do it perfectly without any 
mistakes.”

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:18.200
But students in a growth mindset say their 
number one goal is learning.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:23.066
The reason they do their school work is to learn 
new things.

00:10:23.066 --> 00:10:29.666
They say “I like school work best when it makes 
me think hard and it’s much more important for

00:10:29.666 --> 00:10:36.366
"me to learn new things in my classes than it is 
to get the best grades.”

00:10:36.366 --> 00:10:37.666
Guess what?

00:10:37.666 --> 00:10:46.532
They get the best grades because that outcome, 
that badge of honor that the fixed mindset

00:10:46.533 --> 00:11:00.633
students want so desperately is achieved by the 
growth mindset students because they engage 
deeply and effectively in the learning process.

00:11:00.633 --> 00:11:09.433
Grades, outcomes are a byproduct of engaging 
deeply and effectively in a learning process.

00:11:09.433 --> 00:11:14.366
We’ve been doing a large study of fortune 500 
companies.

00:11:14.366 --> 00:11:21.399
And we hear the same exact thing from the 
fortune 500 people.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:27.866
The more employees held a fixed mindset the 
more they wanted to look smart.

00:11:27.866 --> 00:11:32.566
But not just smart, smarter than everyone else.

00:11:32.566 --> 00:11:41.399
They said “it’s very important to me to show that I 
am more talented than others at work.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:48.800
“When working in teams, it is important to me 
that I am the star of the team.”

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.200
Goodbye teamwork.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.166
[Laughter]

00:11:53.166 --> 00:11:57.432
It’s what we call the culture of genius.

00:11:57.433 --> 00:12:06.466
And it’s about looking and feeling smart at all 
times and at all costs.

00:12:06.466 --> 00:12:13.632
But those with a growth mindset in the fortune 
500 companies said “it’s much more important for

00:12:13.633 --> 00:12:19.599
"me to learn things at work than it is to get the 
highest accolades.”

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:23.400
They wanted to learn, innovate, collaborate.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:28.400
And those are gonna be the star performers.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:35.200
Remember how when I was busy being perfect I 
was also protecting myself?

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:39.400
Protecting myself from the spelling bee and the 
French contest.

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:44.433
I wanted to remain part of the culture of genius.

00:12:44.433 --> 00:12:48.399
And we’ve looked at people in relationships.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:54.266
Those with a fixed mindset tell us they want to be 
worshipped.

00:12:54.266 --> 00:12:57.366
They want to always be right.

00:12:57.366 --> 00:13:04.832
Those with a growth mindset want their partner to 
challenge them to grow.

00:13:04.833 --> 00:13:11.433
When I had a fixed mindset, my worst fault was 
always wanting to be right.

00:13:11.433 --> 00:13:19.599
Even I was put off by the glee, the relish with 
which I said “I told you so.”

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.133
[Laughter]

00:13:21.133 --> 00:13:26.333
On the rare occasion I was wrong, I looked for 
someone…

00:13:26.333 --> 00:13:28.133
[Laughter]

00:13:28.133 --> 00:13:32.333
I looked for someone or something to blame, 
anyone but me.

00:13:32.333 --> 00:13:39.033
My husband and I finally had to invent a third 
party.

00:13:39.033 --> 00:13:40.633
We named in Maurice.

00:13:40.633 --> 00:13:42.866
[Laughter]

00:13:42.866 --> 00:13:45.899
And he was the person we blamed for everything.

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:47.766
[Laughter]

00:13:47.766 --> 00:13:56.699
So that we could get around that blame game 
and start getting to the important things.

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:59.733
 

00:13:59.733 --> 00:14:02.399
Let’s talk about role models.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.933
They’re supposed to be inspiring right?

00:14:05.933 --> 00:14:14.999
You see someone who succeeded in your field, 
who’s like you and it should give you confidence.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.500
It should excite you.

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:23.500
If you’re a person with a fixed mindset, that 
wouldn’t be right.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:29.333
People, Jenny Burnett and her colleagues 
showed in their research, people with a

00:14:29.333 --> 00:14:35.866
fixed mindset are demoralized by successful role 
models.

00:14:35.866 --> 00:14:42.566
They think “Oh that’s a different kind of person 
from me, I could never be like that.”

00:14:42.566 --> 00:14:51.466
That comparison, that gap where they don’t see 
the bridge is undermining to their confidence.

00:14:51.466 --> 00:14:56.932
But people in a growth mindset are inspired by 
role models.

00:14:56.933 --> 00:15:02.566
They think, that person has found a path, I can 
find a path too.

00:15:02.566 --> 00:15:10.399
Maybe I can even find someone like that person 
to mentor me and lead me along the way.

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:23.800
This first part says, that in fixed mindset, there’s 
this constant issue of proving that one is without 
fault.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.833
That one is king or queen of the hill.

00:15:26.833 --> 00:15:30.833
Sounds an awful lot like perfectionism doesn’t it?

00:15:30.833 --> 00:15:36.166
Second, there is a question of effort.

00:15:36.166 --> 00:15:45.399
In a fixed mindset, even effort may shout 
imperfection, inadequacy.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:53.400
People in a fixed mindset believed that if you have 
high ability, you shouldn’t need effort.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:16:01.600
And that if you have to exert effort, why that 
means that you don’t have high ability.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:08.733
Effort to them is only for the lesser, the imperfect 
beings.

00:16:08.733 --> 00:16:10.766
 

00:16:10.766 --> 00:16:14.766
The fixed mindset students in our studies tell us

00:16:14.766 --> 00:16:22.399
“to tell the truth, when I work hard at my school 
work, it makes me feel like I’m not very good at 
it.”

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:34.433
But the students with a growth mindset value 
effort and appreciate it’s power to ignite our 
abilities and help them grow.

00:16:34.433 --> 00:16:39.266
They say “the harder you work at something, the 
better you’ll be at it.”

00:16:39.266 --> 00:16:41.399
 

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:49.100
Same thing with the fortune 500 people, the ones 
with a fixed mindset devalued effort.

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:57.200
If you’re really good at something, they agreed, 
you shouldn’t have to work hard at it.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:01.566
 

00:17:01.566 --> 00:17:08.366
I think this is the worst belief that anyone could 
have.

00:17:08.366 --> 00:17:11.532
Everything important, and this is the sermon part.

00:17:11.533 --> 00:17:12.999
[Laughter]

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:20.433
Everything important in life requires huge 
amounts of effort over long periods of time.

00:17:20.433 --> 00:17:29.599
And if effort makes you feel inadequate, 
incompetent, you’re at a huge disadvantage.

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:42.333
Fascinating studies now show the power of any 
little effort to undermine the confidence of people 
in a fixed mindset.

00:17:42.333 --> 00:17:52.066
David Miele and his colleagues did a series of 
fascinating studies where they gave people

00:17:52.066 --> 00:17:59.066
reading passages and for some of them, they 
made it feel more effortful.

00:17:59.066 --> 00:18:08.232
For example, they made the font more difficult to 
read or they made the sentences in the 
passage...

00:18:08.233 --> 00:18:14.599
They made the syntax a little more complex.

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:24.866
Every little thing that increased the effort you 
needed undermined the confidence of people with 
a fixed mindset.

00:18:24.866 --> 00:18:32.666
They rated themselves as less competent and 
less good at comprehending the passage.

00:18:32.666 --> 00:18:36.499
Every time they had to apply more effort.

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:41.700
Even when effort was induced in these silly and 
irrelevant ways.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:52.200
Since I wrote my book “Mindset” I get letters from 
people who were once child prodigies.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.633
 

00:18:54.633 --> 00:19:01.333
Many of them have not finished university or found 
meaningful work.

00:19:01.333 --> 00:19:08.166
They expected effortless achievement and people 
promised it to them.

00:19:08.166 --> 00:19:12.099
They said “oh you’re so brilliant, you’ll be this, 
you’ll be that.”

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:15.833
So they sat there and waited for that to happen.

00:19:15.833 --> 00:19:18.466
But guess what, it doesn’t work that way.

00:19:18.466 --> 00:19:20.299
You actually have to do something.

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:29.866
Also, being talented became for them something 
that others had to do.

00:19:29.866 --> 00:19:37.866
Being talented became equated with not having to 
work hard like other people.

00:19:37.866 --> 00:19:46.966
When the day finally arrived, and it always does, 
that they did have to work hard, they weren’t able 
to do it.

00:19:46.966 --> 00:19:52.266
It made them feel just the way they didn’t want to 
feel.

00:19:52.266 --> 00:20:07.766
Now, not long ago I spoke to the top athletes in a 
nearby country and they told me not one of them 
had been number one as a teenager.

00:20:07.766 --> 00:20:10.899
The number ones were the naturals.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:15.066
They coasted on their natural ability.

00:20:15.066 --> 00:20:18.466
And they were no longer there.

00:20:18.466 --> 00:20:29.066
Put the people I was speaking to, the people who 
had been number 4 or 9 or 16, they knew they

00:20:29.066 --> 00:20:34.132
had to work hard to get where they wanted to go, 
and they did it.

00:20:34.133 --> 00:20:41.633
They were now the people going to the Olympics 
and the world championships.

00:20:41.633 --> 00:20:56.499
Now this idea of effortless superiority or perfection 
is prevalent in our 2 cultures.

00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:05.266
Your former Prime Minister H.H. Asquith once 
described Oxford men from his college as

00:21:05.266 --> 00:21:12.966
possessing “the tranquil consciousness of an 
effortless superiority.”

00:21:12.966 --> 00:21:15.832
[Laughter]

00:21:15.833 --> 00:21:17.233
 

00:21:17.233 --> 00:21:24.966
And there is something rampant at my university, 
Stanford University called duck syndrome.

00:21:24.966 --> 00:21:27.466
 

00:21:27.466 --> 00:21:29.566
What is duck syndrome?

00:21:29.566 --> 00:21:39.066
Well you know how ducks appear to glide along 
the water effortlessly, but they’re paddling madly 
underneath?

00:21:39.066 --> 00:21:48.399
That’s how many Stanford students are and many 
students at lead institutions.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:22:01.466
They look like they’re not working hard, they go 
to parties, they have lots of other things, but they 
are paddling madly, they’re studying secretly.

00:22:01.466 --> 00:22:03.532
[Laughter]

00:22:03.533 --> 00:22:05.633
So they will look smart.

00:22:05.633 --> 00:22:10.066
One of my crusades is to get rid of duck 
syndrome.

00:22:10.066 --> 00:22:19.866
Because it comes out of this fixed mindset belief 
that you’re only smart if you don’t have to apply 
effort.

00:22:19.866 --> 00:22:26.566
Every year I teach a freshman seminar to 16 
Stanford freshmen.

00:22:26.566 --> 00:22:32.499
And I have them do a paper on their hero.

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:40.566
And how their hero go to be where he or she got 
to.

00:22:40.566 --> 00:22:53.199
Originally many of them think “oh these were just 
supremely talented beings, geniuses, or naturals 
who floated effortlessly to these great heights.”

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:56.766
Not once has that been the case.

00:22:56.766 --> 00:23:06.832
They see that these people they admire worked 
harder than anyone else, often encountered

00:23:06.833 --> 00:23:12.966
seemingly insurmountable setbacks and 
succeeding in surmounting them.

00:23:12.966 --> 00:23:18.866
I think that’s much more admirable than being 
born with something that just propels you

00:23:18.866 --> 00:23:27.199
somewhere and I think we should make that the 
admirable thing throughout our culture.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:35.833
In a fixed mindset, it’s not just perfection, but 
effortless perfection, good luck.

00:23:35.833 --> 00:23:37.099
[Laughter]

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:38.500
 

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:46.466
Third, and finally, in a fixed mindset, errors and 
setbacks are calamities.

00:23:46.466 --> 00:23:47.766
[Baby talks]

00:23:47.766 --> 00:23:48.499
Hello.

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:51.166
[Laughter]

00:23:51.166 --> 00:23:56.599
Errors and setback are calamities, it’s never too 
young, actually to hear this.

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.500
[Laughter]

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:07.100
Because as an aside, and this is aimed at you 
mom, we published a study a few months ago

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:21.766
showing that parents praise to their babies, 1 to 3 
years of age, predicted the child’s mindset and 
desire for challenge 5 years later.

00:24:21.766 --> 00:24:32.066
Mothers who gave their babies process praise 
about the process their engaging in, good effort,

00:24:32.066 --> 00:24:43.166
good trying, good strategies had babies who had 
more of a growth mindset and more desire for 
challenge 5 years later.

00:24:43.166 --> 00:24:47.566
So none of this “you’re brilliant, you’re great, 
you’re a genius”.

00:24:47.566 --> 00:24:54.066
Now I feel qualified to intervene when I hear a 
mother in an airport.

00:24:54.066 --> 00:24:56.466
[Laughter]

00:24:56.466 --> 00:24:58.532
Telling her baby what a genius you are.

00:24:58.533 --> 00:25:00.233
No, no, no, no, no.

00:25:00.233 --> 00:25:01.433
[Laughter]

00:25:01.433 --> 00:25:04.499
 

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:13.066
Third and finally, in a fixed mindset, errors and 
setback are calamities.

00:25:13.066 --> 00:25:21.199
They are the surest sign of incompetence or 
unworthiness and what we find is that people

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:27.600
in a fixed mindset run from their errors or hide 
their errors.

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:36.800
In a study with David Nussbaum, we gave 
engineering students 3 short engineering tests.

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:41.533
Tests we said were tests of engineering aptitude.

00:25:41.533 --> 00:25:48.033
They did really well on 2 of the tests, but poorly 
on the third.

00:25:48.033 --> 00:25:55.499
And then we said “hey which one do you want to 
take a tutorial in and then redo the test and at the

00:25:55.500 --> 00:26:03.566
"end we’ll give you a certificate with your score on 
this last test on the certificate.”

00:26:03.566 --> 00:26:15.232
Those with the growth mindset overwhelmingly 
chose to take a tutorial on the exam that they 
didn’t do so well in.

00:26:15.233 --> 00:26:17.366
That makes sense.

00:26:17.366 --> 00:26:28.266
But those with a fixed mindset overwhelmingly 
chose to take a tutorial in something they were 
already perfect at.

00:26:28.266 --> 00:26:37.199
They didn’t want to risk having a less than perfect 
score emblazoned on our certificate.

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.800
 

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:49.433
You can see how this fear of errors closes people 
off to learning and growth.

00:26:49.433 --> 00:26:55.066
Do you want to know what happens in the brain 
when people encounter errors?

00:26:55.066 --> 00:26:58.532
It depends on your mindset.

00:26:58.533 --> 00:27:08.933
Jason Mosure and his colleagues measured the 
electrical impulses from the part of the brain that

00:27:08.933 --> 00:27:17.133
deals with errors as people worked on a task and 
occasionally made errors.

00:27:17.133 --> 00:27:24.566
When you look at the pictures of the brains of 
people with a growth mindset, while they’re

00:27:24.566 --> 00:27:33.532
making the errors, that part of the brain, the 
anterior cingulate cortex is red hot.

00:27:33.533 --> 00:27:41.399
They are detecting their error, processing the 
error and correcting it.

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:44.966
Detecting, processing, correcting.

00:27:44.966 --> 00:27:50.966
They are gloming onto it and extracting everything 
they can from it.

00:27:50.966 --> 00:28:03.766
But when they looked at the brains of people in a 
fixed mindset as they encountered the errors, 
nothing happened.

00:28:03.766 --> 00:28:08.199
That brain was deep green cold.

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:17.566
They did not process or correct the errors, they 
ran from the errors as quickly as possible.

00:28:17.566 --> 00:28:20.232
Oh that didn’t happen to me, next.

00:28:20.233 --> 00:28:32.266
And again, you can see how not attending to your 
errors, not processing them robs you of valuable

00:28:32.266 --> 00:28:36.999
information that you need to learn, grow and 
succeed.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:48.300
No wonder because of what errors mean, errors 
are deeply diagnostic of their ability.

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:59.900
No wonder we find that students in a fixed 
mindset say after a poor score on an exam they’d 
consider cheating next time.

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:07.666
The poor score meant they weren’t good at it, 
they don’t like effort, they don’t believe in effort.

00:29:07.666 --> 00:29:10.366
Cheating becomes a viable option.

00:29:10.366 --> 00:29:20.366
Or in some studies we’ve found, they lie about a 
poor score when they have the opportunity.

00:29:20.366 --> 00:29:26.199
It’s as though admitting imperfection makes it 
real.

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:29.066
 

00:29:29.066 --> 00:29:34.499
And that imperfection in a fixed mindset is 
permanent.

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:42.933
In my book “Mindset” I write about the tragic 
cases of two young people,

00:29:42.933 --> 00:29:50.233
Janet Cooke and Stephen Glass whose lives 
were completely derailed.

00:29:50.233 --> 00:29:59.166
They were both young journalists who 
skyrocketed to the top by unfabricated articles.

00:29:59.166 --> 00:30:09.632
Janet Cooke actually won a Pulitzer Prize for her 
Washington Post article about an 8 year old boy 
who was a drug addict.

00:30:09.633 --> 00:30:15.566
The boy did not exist and she was later stripped 
of her prize.

00:30:15.566 --> 00:30:22.166
Stephen Glass was the wizkid of the New 
Republic Magazine.

00:30:22.166 --> 00:30:28.132
He seemed to have stories and sources that 
other reporters only dreamed of.

00:30:28.133 --> 00:30:31.999
The problem was, he dreamt it all up.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.966
The sources didn’t exist, the stories weren’t true.

00:30:36.966 --> 00:30:46.366
Did Janet Cooke and Stephen Glass feel that 
admitting ignorance would discredit them with 
their colleagues?

00:30:46.366 --> 00:30:56.766
Did they feel they should already be like the big 
time expert reporters before they did the hard 
work of learning how?

00:30:56.766 --> 00:31:04.732
Stephen Glass said “we were the stars, 
precocious stars and that was what mattered.”

00:31:04.733 --> 00:31:11.399
The public understands them as cheats and 
cheat they did.

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:24.133
But I understand them as talented young people 
who succumbed to the pressures of a fixed 
mindset.

00:31:24.133 --> 00:31:28.033
Who felt they had to be perfect.

00:31:28.033 --> 00:31:32.166
There was a saying in the 60’s that went like this.

00:31:32.166 --> 00:31:34.499
The 1960’s.

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:40.133
“Becoming is better than being.”

00:31:40.133 --> 00:31:49.833
The fixed mindset doesn’t allow people the luxury 
of becoming, they already have to be.

00:31:49.833 --> 00:31:52.666
And be perfect.

00:31:52.666 --> 00:31:55.199
 

00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:04.133
The good news as we were told at the beginning 
is that a growth mindset can be taught.

00:32:04.133 --> 00:32:08.733
It can be taught at any age.

00:32:08.733 --> 00:32:16.799
It can be taught to little kids and in fact parents 
tell me often.

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:23.800
I got an email from an executive at Apple not long 
ago.

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:33.166
He said his 4 and ½ year old son was taking 
piano lessons and was struggling through his 
practice.

00:32:33.166 --> 00:32:42.632
The good dad started marching over where upon 
the son turned around and said “don’t worry dad, I 
have a growth mindset.”

00:32:42.633 --> 00:32:45.866
[Laughter]

00:32:45.866 --> 00:32:52.966
Many parents tell me their 3 year olds will say 
“good effort mommy.”

00:32:52.966 --> 00:32:54.766
[Laughter]

00:32:54.766 --> 00:32:59.199
Or a “good try daddy, maybe you can try another 
way.”

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:08.933
My former student Jason Platts is now doing 
studies with elderly individuals showing that

00:33:08.933 --> 00:33:14.466
teaching a growth mindset improves their memory 
performance.

00:33:14.466 --> 00:33:16.866
 

00:33:16.866 --> 00:33:26.832
In our studies where we teach a growth mindset, 
we teach people that every time they push out of

00:33:26.833 --> 00:33:41.366
their comfort zone, work on something really hard 
and learn something new, their brains form new 
connections and overtime they can get smarter.

00:33:41.366 --> 00:33:43.732
This is a thrilling message.

00:33:43.733 --> 00:33:50.333
We’ll never forget the one boy in one of our 
studies, a teenage boy in one of our workshops.

00:33:50.333 --> 00:33:52.866
He was the bane of our existence.

00:33:52.866 --> 00:33:59.032
He was always cutting up with his friends, being 
disruptive.

00:33:59.033 --> 00:34:03.633
He seemed uninterested in our pearls of wisdom.

00:34:03.633 --> 00:34:11.133
But, when we started teaching the growth 
mindset, and how you can grow your brain like a

00:34:11.133 --> 00:34:20.866
muscle, he sat down, shooed his friends away 
and said “you mean I don’t have to be dumb?”

00:34:20.866 --> 00:34:28.999
And he caught fire as have many students 
learning the growth mindset.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:43.566
But the amazing thing is that learning this growth 
mindset in this way, completely transforms the 
meaning of effort and difficulty.

00:34:43.566 --> 00:34:57.166
In a fixed mindset, effort and difficulty people say 
make you feel dumb, incompetent, inadequate.

00:34:57.166 --> 00:35:08.899
But in a growth mindset, we learn that when we’re 
struggling with effort and difficulty, that’s when 
we’re getting smarter.

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:16.833
That’s when the brain is forming new connections 
and making us more competent.

00:35:16.833 --> 00:35:18.999
Can you feel that difference?

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.033
 

00:35:21.033 --> 00:35:28.333
I’m on a worldwide crusade now to change our 
value system.

00:35:28.333 --> 00:35:40.433
Away from effortless success as the ultimate and 
toward effortful success as the ultimate.

00:35:40.433 --> 00:35:49.666
Not long ago someone from another country said 
to me “in your culture, struggle is a bad word.”

00:35:49.666 --> 00:35:51.732
I said “you know, you’re right.”

00:35:51.733 --> 00:35:58.833
Rarely do you come home at the end of the day 
and say “honey, I’ve had a fabulous struggle.”

00:35:58.833 --> 00:36:00.066
[Laughter]

00:36:00.066 --> 00:36:07.232
No, usually you’re crawling in the door, dragging 
yourself over the threshold.

00:36:07.233 --> 00:36:10.333
Maybe in need of some form of libation.

00:36:10.333 --> 00:36:20.266
But, why shouldn’t we revere struggle, it means 
we’ve worked hard towards something we value.

00:36:20.266 --> 00:36:27.466
Why shouldn’t we sit around the dinner table and 
say “who had a fabulous struggle today?”

00:36:27.466 --> 00:36:33.866
And each person goes around and shares what 
they’ve struggled with.

00:36:33.866 --> 00:36:37.532
What are you gonna struggle with tomorrow?

00:36:37.533 --> 00:36:43.433
That is the greatest gift that we can give 
ourselves and others.

00:36:43.433 --> 00:36:50.066
That value system that says struggle, that’s when 
you grow the neurons.

00:36:50.066 --> 00:36:55.166
Struggle, that’s when you’re doing something 
important.

00:36:55.166 --> 00:36:57.199
 

00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:04.966
So instead of praising each other, when you do 
something easily, quickly, without mistakes, no,

00:37:04.966 --> 00:37:12.599
because that means hey, if you didn’t do it 
quickly, easily, without mistakes, you wouldn’t be 
praise worthy.

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:18.166
We should say “oh easy, that’s a waste of time.”

00:37:18.166 --> 00:37:24.432
Something hard, now that’s juicy, that’s 
something you can sink your teeth into.

00:37:24.433 --> 00:37:29.599
Something you can learn from, something 
worthwhile.

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:41.400
I fear that in our eagerness to instil confidence in 
the younger generations and in each other, we’re 
praising the wrong things.

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:48.900
Our work shows that praising easy, praising 
brilliance, no.

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:56.833
Let’s get that value system where difficult things, 
where you struggle, you make mistakes.

00:37:56.833 --> 00:38:01.633
Flounder, that’s when it happens.

00:38:01.633 --> 00:38:04.799
That’s the zone of getting smarter.

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.633
So what about me?

00:38:06.633 --> 00:38:08.833
Am I still perfect?

00:38:08.833 --> 00:38:11.966
No, not by a long shot.

00:38:11.966 --> 00:38:18.466
I pursue high standards, but shouldn’t we get rid 
of that word perfect?

00:38:18.466 --> 00:38:27.199
It has tormented so many talented people and 
doomed them to oblivion.

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:32.233
Being a work in progress, isn’t that better than 
perfect?

00:38:32.233 --> 00:38:40.399
Setting high standards, striving to learn, working, 
struggling toward hard things we value.

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:45.866
Failing and bounding back, isn’t that better than 
perfect?

00:38:45.866 --> 00:38:50.599
Can we find another word that’s better than 
perfect?

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:53.566
Growth, growthism, growthiness.

00:38:53.566 --> 00:39:00.832
What if the highest complement were “boy, you 
have such wonderful growthiness.”

00:39:00.833 --> 00:39:02.466
[Laughter]

00:39:02.466 --> 00:39:05.866
Well okay, so that’s a work in progress too.

00:39:05.866 --> 00:39:11.699
But if you can think of a good word, all 
suggestions are welcome.

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:25.200
I want to return one final time to Pam Scott’s 
survey of people where she asked them “am I a 
perfectionist?”

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:42.033
One of them said “the thing that is really hard and 
really amazing is giving up on being perfect and 
beginning the work of becoming myself.”

00:39:42.033 --> 00:39:43.866
I agree.

00:39:43.866 --> 00:39:59.032
By giving up the idea of perfection, we can start a 
life long wondrous, ever rewarding journey to 
becoming ourselves.

00:39:59.033 --> 00:40:00.233
Thank you.

00:40:00.233 --> 00:40:07.699
[Applause]
