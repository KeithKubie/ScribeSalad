00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200
[Captions by Y Translator]
Normally, it seems

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.800
like melting metal with
flashlight would be impossible.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.100
But we're going to take
it to some extremes.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.400
We're going to take an extremely
powerful flashlight,

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.100
and a metal with an extremely
low melting point,

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.640
and see if we can pull it off.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:19.620
[Music]

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.720
This flashlight has
several settings.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.100
120 lumens,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.280
500 lumens,

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.400
1,500 lumens,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.660
5,000 lumens,

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.000
13,000 lumens,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.800
and an astonishingly
powerful 32,000 lumens,

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.700
which basically lights
up a dark room

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.100
as though it were daylight.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.200
And along with all
of that light,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.780
comes a fair amount of heat.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.100
This flashlight gets
pretty good and hot

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.200
if you leave it
on that 32,000 lumens setting.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.600
So we're going to take some

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.000
of our gallium Lego
figures and whatnot,

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.400
and see if we
can melt them down.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.500
The basic premise is simple.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.400
We're going to pour
some molten gallium

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.800
into some silicone molds,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.800
and once it freezes,
we're going to see

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.260
if we can melt it by using our
giant overpowered flashlight.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.000
We've got some molten gallium,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.252
let's pour ourselves
some Lego men.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:22.980
[Music]

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.300
Our gallium is now solidified,

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.200
and I think we can start
taking pieces out of the mold.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.500
Now, I don't think we'll
actually end up melting all

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.100
of these with a flashlight,
but some of them, we will,

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.060
and that'll be fun.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.800
It will scrap run off
pieces in some places.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.540
Little metallic gemstones here.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.280
[Music]

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.600
See how well
our Lego bricks poured.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.552
It's not too bad.

00:01:45.112 --> 00:01:45.700
On some of these,

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.800
you can actually even
see the word Lego,

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.000
and then some of them,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.500
it didn't really
fill the cavity,

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.900
and it's just a nice
little round curve bump.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.200
[Music]

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.060
[inaudible] are Mongo Lego man.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.040
Oh, it's nice.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.340
Okay R2, how you doing?

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.100
[Music]

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.300
Got some flashing.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.700
It definitely went up
and over the sides,

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.200
but a lot of good
detail in R2D2 here.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.300
Continuing with the
Star Wars theme,

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.900
we've got Han Solo in well,
it's not carbonite but close enough.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.100
On both of these,

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.400
it didn't quite get
the detail of his face.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.800
So we've got Han Solo
with his face washed out.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.620
One more for the Star Wars,
we've got a stormtrooper helmet.

00:02:29.932 --> 00:02:32.412
Oh, that looks amazing!

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.260
[Music]

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.580
We are going to take
our little Lego man,

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.900
set him right here
with our nice black background,

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.482
and aim our flashlight at him.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.400
We're going to have
to get this pretty close.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.000
So kind of right there.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.800
We might set the backup
on something here.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.680
About like that.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.900
Let's see how he takes the heat.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.260
As a quick test,
here it is at full brightness.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:27.980
[Music]

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.000
In our first test,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.680
our little Lego man started
to melt a little bit.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.500
In fact, we got a little bit
of gallium dripping off of him,

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.300
but we didn't get
the whole thing to puddle,

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.812
and our flashlights
started to overheat.

00:03:40.292 --> 00:03:41.800
It does put out a lot of heat,

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.592
but not all of it
leaves the flashlight.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.062
Some of it just stays inside,

00:03:45.062 --> 00:03:46.700
and the casing even
got really hot.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.832
So our flashlight
is cooling down,

00:03:49.612 --> 00:03:51.700
and we're going
to try another method

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.200
with our little Lego guy.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.300
Our flashlight overheated
with our first test.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.040
So for our second test,

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.280
we're going to see
what we can do to cool it down.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.520
This is a giant ice pack.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.300
We're just going to have it sit
right on our giant ice pack,

00:04:07.352 --> 00:04:10.700
and then have some more ice
sitting on top of it.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.500
Hopefully, this will keep
our flashlight cool long enough,

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.200
that our Lego man
will take the full brunt,

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.300
and go down with it.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.100
However,

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.500
that's not quite all
we're gonna do to do.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.992
We've also got a piece of foil,

00:04:25.522 --> 00:04:28.900
and we're going to build
a little cave over our Lego man

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.482
to hold in some of that heat.

00:04:32.012 --> 00:04:33.512
We really don't want
him to survive.

00:04:33.512 --> 00:04:58.340
[Music]

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.302
Let's see what we can do,
with a blowtorch.

00:05:01.332 --> 00:05:18.260
[Music]

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.000
You know, that looked almost exactly
like the dude in Indiana Jones,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.600
who chose the wrong Goblet.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.000
He just like melts away
from the outside in.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:43.540
[Music]

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.200
So the gallium melted,

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.200
but some details from R2D2
are still visible.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.000
I assume that's
where the gallium had oxidized,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.800
or had dust,

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.600
or some other chemical substrate
just left on it.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:57.700
That's so cool.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.400
You can still see some
of that printing even,

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.480
though it's now just a puddle.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:31.420
[Music]

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.980
3, 2, 1.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:45.520
[Music]

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:16.560
[Music]

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.060
Perfect.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:18.640
That was awesome.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:20.940
Beautiful.

00:07:21.962 --> 00:07:23.900
Melting metal with a flashlight.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.500
It's not very practical,
and it's not very efficient.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.820
But if you use gallium and
a really powerful flashlight,

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:31.300
it is possible to get it to go.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.000
I think gallium is more fun
to melt in some other ways.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.380
It looked really cool.

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:36.200
Pretty much every way.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.100
Every way you melt gallium,
it looks really cool,

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.600
and I just discovered
how unbelievably

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.120
fragile gallium is when you
freeze it in liquid nitrogen.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.700
So we're definitely going
to do more of that soon.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:45.800
What do you think?

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.462
Anything else you want to see
us try out with our giant,

00:07:48.692 --> 00:07:49.922
overpowered flashlight.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:51.240
Let us know down
in the comments.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:53.000
Q&amp;A time.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.080
You've got the Qs.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.500
We've hopefully got some A's.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.120
I don't even know
if that makes sense.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.440
We're going to leave it in.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.600
Maybe the editors
will take it out.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.200
I don't know.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.500
I'm not in charge
of these things.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.892
All right, we've got
a question from Dylan Morgan

00:08:05.342 --> 00:08:09.182
or @dylanmorgan1122,
and they are asking,

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.840
"any new merch coming out soon?"

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.960
Dylan, yes, we do have
new merchs coming soon.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.400
I'm actually wearing
a new shirt.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.700
By the time you see this Q&amp;A,

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.000
maybe we've already
made the announcement.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.600
It's been on the website
for a while.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.600
I've never been
a huge fan of shirts

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.482
that have just like
stuff all over them.

00:08:25.482 --> 00:08:26.600
But these are fairly subtle.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.092
Like they've got the TKOR logo,

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.800
and just like racing stripes
on the sleeve.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.800
Weather might be getting
a little bit colder soon,

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.980
so it's gonna be nice to have
some more long-sleeve stuff.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:39.660
Ivan Olavarria,
@IvanOlavarria15 asks,

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:43.380
"What's the worst accident
you guys have had?"

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:48.000
I assume that kind of means like
what's the most injured we've been,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.400
or most damage that's been done.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.300
I have been
pretty lucky in that.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.500
I don't think I've really had

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:57.300
anything be severely
damaged on the show.

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.400
I don't think I've
really injured myself

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.400
severely on the show.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.200
I think the worst injury
of sustained so far was

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.900
while I was casting
the Iron Man helmet and candy,

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.400
a drip of the molten hot candy
fell out of the mold

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:10.300
and landed on my arm.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:11.600
I've got a little bit
of a scar here.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.100
That's about nine months old,

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:14.952
and we'll see
if that sticks around forever.

00:09:15.152 --> 00:09:15.782
But yeah,

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:19.500
I haven't actually been hurt
very much on the channel so far.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.700
One of the most serious injuries

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:25.500
I've ever received from any sort
of building projects,

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.500
you can see I've got a nice
fun scar from now on as well,

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.780
my thumb here.

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:31.700
All right, so that,
that will scar right there.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.800
That was me doing
something exceptionally dumb.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:35.200
I had a little piece of wood,

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.400
a 1 by 1 by 1 inch
block of wood,

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.700
and I wanted to drill
a hole in it,

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.000
and I very foolishly thought,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
"Oh, I'll hold the block

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.220
while I drill a hole
in it with a drill press,"

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.500
and I was holding it,

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.400
and then the drill
was going down into it,

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.500
and it cut a little bit,
and then it just seized,

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.100
and that little 1 inch cube
just started spinning

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.600
at the same speed of this drill,

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.300
and so it just like spun
and cut into my thumb,

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.900
and it actually just like
a chunk of my thumb was missing.

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:03.700
It wasn't just
like a nice little cut.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.400
There is just like,
"Oh, I see

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.840
that I'm missing a small portion
of my thumb now,"

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.300
and so that was...

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:11.900
I mean, just so dumb.

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:13.692
Don't hold onto things
while you drill it.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:16.100
You clamp them down,
but that's...

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:20.100
That's probably the most
serious injury I've received.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.500
Guys, that's it for today,

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:22.900
but the fun doesn't
have to end here.

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.400
That box up at the top will take
you directly to our last video,

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.300
and you should check that out.

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:26.800
The other box will show you

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.202
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next,

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:31.100
and this bomb in the middle
will subscribe your channel,

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.920
so you never miss
out on the video.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:33.800
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:34.922
and we'll see you
in the next one.

00:10:35.032 --> 00:10:35.600
Talk you then.
