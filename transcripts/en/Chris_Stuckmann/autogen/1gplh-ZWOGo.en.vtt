like a two-minute scene where a bunch of
 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.440
like a two-minute scene where a bunch of
information is thrown at us it's kind of

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450
information is thrown at us it's kind of
 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.940
information is thrown at us it's kind of
difficult to really understand what the

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950

it just an action movie with some fight
 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.780
it just an action movie with some fight
scenes and explosions or is this trying

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790
scenes and explosions or is this trying
 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.550
scenes and explosions or is this trying
to be something more if it's trying to

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560
to be something more if it's trying to
 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.959
to be something more if it's trying to
be something more which I really do

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969
be something more which I really do
 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.719
be something more which I really do
think it is it's very unclear as to what

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729
think it is it's very unclear as to what

think it is it's very unclear as to what
they're going for the only thing we

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649
they're going for the only thing we
 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.649
they're going for the only thing we
learn about Mark Wahlberg's character is

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659
learn about Mark Wahlberg's character is
 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.289
learn about Mark Wahlberg's character is
through narration and files that are

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299
through narration and files that are
 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.029
through narration and files that are
thrown our way during the opening

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039
thrown our way during the opening
 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.850
thrown our way during the opening
credits sequence if it wasn't for that

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860
credits sequence if it wasn't for that
 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.890
credits sequence if it wasn't for that
opening credits sequence we wouldn't

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900
opening credits sequence we wouldn't
 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.370
opening credits sequence we wouldn't
know in

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380
know in
 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.200
know in
thing about his character we learn

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210
thing about his character we learn
 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.940
thing about his character we learn
everything in those two minutes and

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950
everything in those two minutes and
 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.650
everything in those two minutes and
after that we barely figure out anything

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660
after that we barely figure out anything
 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.780
after that we barely figure out anything
else also troubling is that the film

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790
else also troubling is that the film
 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.610
else also troubling is that the film
doesn't seem to have a middle it

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620
doesn't seem to have a middle it
 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.080
doesn't seem to have a middle it
definitely has a beginning and it

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090
definitely has a beginning and it
 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.120
definitely has a beginning and it
definitely has an end but somewhere

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130
definitely has an end but somewhere
 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.070
definitely has an end but somewhere
partway through the movie it feels like

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080
partway through the movie it feels like
 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.840
partway through the movie it feels like
the first act and the third act just

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850
the first act and the third act just
 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.110
the first act and the third act just
collided because there's a setup there's

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120
collided because there's a setup there's
 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.060
collided because there's a setup there's
an opening scene and then we learn a

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070
an opening scene and then we learn a
 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.650
an opening scene and then we learn a
little bit about what's happening and

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660
little bit about what's happening and
 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.090
little bit about what's happening and
then all of a sudden they've got this

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100
then all of a sudden they've got this
 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.830
then all of a sudden they've got this
guy and they're transporting him and

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840
guy and they're transporting him and
 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.200
guy and they're transporting him and
then the movie is just a big long action

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210
then the movie is just a big long action
 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.660
then the movie is just a big long action
scene and nothing really feels like it

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670
scene and nothing really feels like it
 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.070
scene and nothing really feels like it
happens in the middle it doesn't really

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080
happens in the middle it doesn't really
 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.960
happens in the middle it doesn't really
feel like there's time to breathe and

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970
feel like there's time to breathe and
 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.730
feel like there's time to breathe and
while I usually actually really like

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740
while I usually actually really like
 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.780
while I usually actually really like
that in a film here I was hoping for

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790
that in a film here I was hoping for
 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.720
that in a film here I was hoping for
more I was like what's going on in their

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730
more I was like what's going on in their
 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.550
more I was like what's going on in their
heads were thrown into these action

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560
heads were thrown into these action
 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.620
heads were thrown into these action
sequences so quickly with very little

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630
sequences so quickly with very little
 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.390
sequences so quickly with very little
build-up and so it's difficult to care

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400
build-up and so it's difficult to care
 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.550
build-up and so it's difficult to care
about what's going on and sometimes we

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560
about what's going on and sometimes we
 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.500
about what's going on and sometimes we
are asked to give a shit and I just

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510
are asked to give a shit and I just
 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.020
are asked to give a shit and I just
didn't but by far and I've been saving

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030
didn't but by far and I've been saving
 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.180
didn't but by far and I've been saving
this by far the thing about this film
