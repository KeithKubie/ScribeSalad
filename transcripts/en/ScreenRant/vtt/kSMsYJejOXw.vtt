00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.710
There are more remakes and sequels being released
than original films today but than again are

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.370
they really original?

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.640
Films reuse plotlines over and over again
but that’s okay because they usually find

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.450
a plotline twist that we love and we keep
heading into theaters.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.550
Disney has been making animated films since
1937 and their first film Snow White was based

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.820
off a popular Brothers Grimm story.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.380
Still, sometimes their plotlines are closer
to films that have already been released and

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.900
people are quick to point out the similarities.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.030
Here is Screen Rant’s list of ten Times
Disney Stole Ideas From Other Popular Movies.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:44.040
Stick around to the end of the video for a
Frozen fact that you might not have known.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.430
Aladdin

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:55.370
Nearly thirty years in the making, Miramax
released The Thief And The Cobbler in 1995.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.190
Miramax, which was a subsidiary of Disney
at the time was supposed to beat Aladdin into

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.790
theater but did not.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.750
When watching the two films it is impossible
not to see the similarities.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:12.251
Both villains had a bird as a partner in crime,
numerous costumes looked the same and the

00:01:12.251 --> 00:01:15.510
villain in Cobbler looked a great deal like
Aladdin’s Genie.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:28.200
Both of these films are considered classic
animations today, even if you see the similarities.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.200
Toy Story

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.490
The story of toys coming to life when humans
aren’t around and these toys having their

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.770
own secret life was the plotline of a Jim
Henson special released in 1986.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.440
Henson released a special called, The Christmas
Toy where the protagonist is desperate to

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.380
keep his status as the favorite toy.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.710
When a new toy arrives that is space themed
she doesn’t believe she is a toy.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.060
Doesn’t that sound familiar to the story
line of 1996’s Toy Story?

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.670
It’s okay Disney has worked with the Henson
team for many years and today they even own

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.670
The Muppets.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.060
Wait till you see which film’s plotline
is similar to Toy Story 2.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.060
Monsters Inc.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.560
A monster living under your bed isn’t a
new concept but having a portal to a world

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.340
of monsters is a little more unique.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.440
In the 1989 film, Little Monsters, Fred Savage
follows a blue furry, horn toting monster

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.030
into a monster world.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.110
In Monsters Inc. an adorable little girl follows
a big blue monster into her closet to another

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.600
monster world.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.740
The few people who have actually a seen both
films saw the similarities but there is less

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.620
in common than there is in common.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.840
Now if Fred Savage returned to this monster
land to go to college, than we might have

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:46.220
an issue with Disney.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.220
The Incredibles

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.330
2004’s The Incredibles is about a family
of four with these super powers: Superhuman

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.630
strength, ability to be invisible, super speed;
and the ability to stretch and flex like rubber.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.550
Another story of four superheroes with superpowers
is The Fantastic Four, with their superpowers

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.990
being: Superhuman strength, ability to be
invisible, ability to generate flames and

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.959
fly and the ability to stretch and flex like
rubber.

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.850
Three out of four are the same but what happens
when baby Jack-Jack finds his powers?

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.770
He can self-combust, levitate and teleport;
that sounds pretty close to us.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.910
What do you think?

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.709
The Lion King

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:32.800
The Lion King was billed as Disney’s first
big animated feature that wasn’t a retelling

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.980
of a fairytale or a previous story.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.310
So when the similarities to the Japanese-created
American television cartoon series called,

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.580
Kimba The White Lion was revealed it was a
little shocking.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.910
From the plotline to the strong image of a
lion standing atop Pride Rock, all of this

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.260
can be seen in the cartoon series.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.110
Still Disney states that The Lion King was
based off Bambi and Hamlet despite the similarities.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.030
You remember the scene with Bambi’s departed
parent talking to them as a cloud.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:08.050
Oh wait, that was Kimba’s parent.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.050
Toy Story 2

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.950
The filmmakers behind Toy Story must love
Jim Henson’s work as much as we do.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.739
Toy Story 2 has a very similar plotline to
1985’s Follow That Bird, starring Big Bird.

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.400
Big Bird leaves Sesame Street and finds other
birds more like him, he gets kidnapped and

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.289
forced to perform in a circus.

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:31.199
His family from Sesame Street saves him and
he goes back to his home where he truly belongs.

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.430
Woody leaves his home when a toy collector
steals him.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:40.999
Winds up with cowboy characters just like
him and he’s going to be displayed in a

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:44.620
museum but is ultimately saved by his friends
and returns home.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:57.289
Luckily Toy Story 3 doesn’t have any Henson
similarities or we would start to wonder.

00:04:57.289 --> 00:04:58.810
Toy Story 3

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.509
Speaking of the Toy Story franchise, we all
know how important John Lasseter is to the

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:04.509
Pixar studios.

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:08.449
Did you know he worked on the story for a
Disney film called, The Brave Little Toaster?

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:13.009
In both films a kid goes off to college and
through a misunderstanding his toys or appliances

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:14.009
are taken away.

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:18.279
The films are about the adventures of these
toys making their way back to their owner,

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:26.099
both having a life or death scene at the city
dump.

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:27.099
Robin Hood

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:32.560
When Walt Disney died in 1966, it took a long
time for the studio to release another animated

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.560
hit.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.110
One of the reasons was that the studios were
cutting back the budgets of these films and

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.050
the filmmakers had to find ways to cut their
costs.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.770
One trick was to re-draw over previous cells
made for other Disney films.

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.330
They even went as far back to their first
animated release of Snow White for the film

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.330
Robin Hood.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.449
This is one-way Disney stole from the old
and gave to the new.

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:54.650
Cars

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.729
1991’s Doc Hollywood starred Michael J.
Fox as a doctor who crashes his car into a

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:01.270
fence at a small town.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:09.949
The judge sentences him to community service
and he soon comes to respect the town’s

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:11.110
old fashion doctor.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.400
Once he is able to leave he wants to return
to his newfound home.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:22.099
Looks like Disney said, “I love that car
crash scene but the people ruin this movie”.

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:26.119
So they got rid of the people and changed
the storyline a little and we got the animated

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:27.139
film Cars.

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:33.000
Still, we don’t remember any scene with
a car coming our of the water without her

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.800
hood down.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.800
Frozen

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.680
The story of a Snowman that comes to life
is nothing new but tell that to animator Kelly

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.569
Wilson who made the 2009 short The Snowman.

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:50.759
In Frozen’s teaser, Olaf sneezes off his
nose and Kristoff’s reindeer Sven goes after

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:51.940
that carrot nose.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:56.589
In The Snowman, after the snowman looses his
nose bunnies try to take it from him.

00:06:56.589 --> 00:06:59.530
Some of the shots are even identical to Disney’s
teaser.

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:09.270
Either way the movie Frozen melted our hearts
and The Snowman was adorable to watch too.

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:10.439
