everything is so early on like you were
 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.500
everything is so early on like you were
saying it's like it it might not be the

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510
saying it's like it it might not be the
 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.840
saying it's like it it might not be the
most like mind blowing thing but even

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850
most like mind blowing thing but even
 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.200
most like mind blowing thing but even
just that the smallest interaction

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210
just that the smallest interaction
 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.340
just that the smallest interaction
design that can just feel really good

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350
design that can just feel really good
 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.190
design that can just feel really good
feels like 10 times better because it's

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200
feels like 10 times better because it's
 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.900
feels like 10 times better because it's
in VR right and like so it's just really

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910
in VR right and like so it's just really
 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.850
in VR right and like so it's just really
finding those core little moments that

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860
finding those core little moments that
 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.310
finding those core little moments that
feel really nice and then building

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320
feel really nice and then building
 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.660
feel really nice and then building
around those and then kind of like

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670
around those and then kind of like
 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.220
around those and then kind of like
sometimes we also come from the other

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230
sometimes we also come from the other
 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.450
sometimes we also come from the other
direction I'd be curious to know how you

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460
direction I'd be curious to know how you
 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.670
direction I'd be curious to know how you
guys think about it because it's like

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680
guys think about it because it's like
 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.200
guys think about it because it's like
it's just the Matic you know it's like

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210
it's just the Matic you know it's like
 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.810
it's just the Matic you know it's like
oh I want to be in this world or our

just a little moment of whether it's

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010
just a little moment of whether it's
 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.350
just a little moment of whether it's
like a character looking at you or

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360
like a character looking at you or
 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.950
like a character looking at you or
something like that is just it can that

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960
something like that is just it can that
 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.050
something like that is just it can that
can be the the hook the hook moment that

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060
can be the the hook the hook moment that
 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.930
can be the the hook the hook moment that
you build everything else around so I

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940
you build everything else around so I
 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.030
you build everything else around so I
don't yeah we come out of very much from

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040
don't yeah we come out of very much from
 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.550
don't yeah we come out of very much from
a narrative storytelling perspective

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560
a narrative storytelling perspective
 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.620
a narrative storytelling perspective
that's that's kind of the benefit of

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630
that's that's kind of the benefit of
 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.540
that's that's kind of the benefit of
having a guy like Erik Darnell is he's

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550
having a guy like Erik Darnell is he's
 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.550
having a guy like Erik Darnell is he's
very prolific in terms of his ideas and

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560
very prolific in terms of his ideas and
 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.260
very prolific in terms of his ideas and
has written a number of scripts that we

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270
has written a number of scripts that we
 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.700
has written a number of scripts that we
then start with these are the story

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710
then start with these are the story
 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.310
then start with these are the story
lines and he actually will pitch him to

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320
lines and he actually will pitch him to
 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.710
lines and he actually will pitch him to
the audience to the office as a whole so

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720
the audience to the office as a whole so
 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.150
the audience to the office as a whole so
we have these kind of brainstorming

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160
we have these kind of brainstorming
 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.610
we have these kind of brainstorming
sessions and then he runs through the

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620
sessions and then he runs through the
 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.650
sessions and then he runs through the
story and then we get feedback on the

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660
story and then we get feedback on the
 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.660
story and then we get feedback on the
story and kind of he takes that and

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:27.670
story and kind of he takes that and
 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.220
story and kind of he takes that and
adjusts it and then we go into kind of

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:29.230
adjusts it and then we go into kind of
 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.230
adjusts it and then we go into kind of
interactive sessions as kind of thinking

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240
interactive sessions as kind of thinking
 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.060
interactive sessions as kind of thinking
about wouldn't it be cool if we could do

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070
about wouldn't it be cool if we could do
 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.340
about wouldn't it be cool if we could do
this and so there's already starting to

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350
this and so there's already starting to
 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.980
this and so there's already starting to
be this emerging body of things that

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990
be this emerging body of things that
 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.030
be this emerging body of things that
happen in VR that people have attached

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:42.040
happen in VR that people have attached
 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.950

those types of things are super cool to

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:56.349
those types of things are super cool to
 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:05:59.700

be watching created in this new medium

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710
be watching created in this new medium
 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.170
be watching created in this new medium
because it's just like you know when

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180
because it's just like you know when
 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.719
because it's just like you know when
smartphones came out and Angry Birds did

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:03.729
smartphones came out and Angry Birds did

you know kind of the eye can actually

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830
you know kind of the eye can actually
 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.529
you know kind of the eye can actually
get the feel of like a slingshot out of

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:07.539
get the feel of like a slingshot out of
 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:09.629
get the feel of like a slingshot out of
a piece of glass so this is that new

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:09.639
a piece of glass so this is that new
 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:11.820
a piece of glass so this is that new
thing here and that's kind of how we go

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830
thing here and that's kind of how we go
 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.040
thing here and that's kind of how we go
through that process yeah and I think

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.050
through that process yeah and I think
 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.170
through that process yeah and I think
like our razor for like what works or

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:16.180
like our razor for like what works or
 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.700
like our razor for like what works or
doesn't work often comes down to like

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:17.710
doesn't work often comes down to like
 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.329
doesn't work often comes down to like
comfort very often comfort Elise is like

something in VR it's like very easy to

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:26.740
something in VR it's like very easy to
 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.249
something in VR it's like very easy to
do and I think we especially in our

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:29.259
do and I think we especially in our
 

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:31.050
do and I think we especially in our
earlier days of our company like we

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.060
earlier days of our company like we
 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.579
earlier days of our company like we
would do a lot of experimentation around

00:06:32.579 --> 00:06:32.589
would do a lot of experimentation around
 

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:34.769
would do a lot of experimentation around
like camera motion like a couple of our

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:34.779
like camera motion like a couple of our
 

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:36.089
like camera motion like a couple of our
games are like these third-person

00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:36.099
games are like these third-person
 

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:37.850
games are like these third-person
experiences like along together where

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860
experiences like along together where
 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.629
experiences like along together where
cameras moving through the environment

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:39.639

and I can very easily make people feel

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:42.490
and I can very easily make people feel
 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.119
and I can very easily make people feel
uncomfortable what we've like to develop

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:45.129
uncomfortable what we've like to develop
 

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:46.559
uncomfortable what we've like to develop
those systems to make them comfortable

00:06:46.559 --> 00:06:46.569
those systems to make them comfortable
 

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:49.019
those systems to make them comfortable
we've like literally will be just like

00:06:49.019 --> 00:06:49.029
we've like literally will be just like
 

00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:50.610
we've like literally will be just like
laying on a sofa for about an hour

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:50.620
laying on a sofa for about an hour
 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.260
laying on a sofa for about an hour
because we tried something that's like

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:52.270
because we tried something that's like
 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.510
because we tried something that's like
oh god need the guys without the depth

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:54.520
oh god need the guys without the depth

we're not those guys and I'd say to

00:07:03.269 --> 00:07:03.279
we're not those guys and I'd say to
 

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:04.980
we're not those guys and I'd say to
follow up on that in addition to the

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:04.990
follow up on that in addition to the
 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.320
follow up on that in addition to the
kind of comfort level the things that

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:07.330
kind of comfort level the things that
 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:08.969
kind of comfort level the things that
we're really focused on is that

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:08.979
we're really focused on is that
 

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:10.829
we're really focused on is that
interactivity that you're layering in

00:07:10.829 --> 00:07:10.839
interactivity that you're layering in
 

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:13.139
interactivity that you're layering in
doesn't really detract from a narrative

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:13.149
doesn't really detract from a narrative
 

00:07:13.149 --> 00:07:15.449
doesn't really detract from a narrative
that's of critical importance to us as

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:15.459
that's of critical importance to us as
 

00:07:15.459 --> 00:07:17.879
that's of critical importance to us as
storytellers is that the interactivity

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:17.889
storytellers is that the interactivity
 

00:07:17.889 --> 00:07:20.219
storytellers is that the interactivity
enhances the story as opposed to becomes

enhances the story as opposed to becomes
the focus of kind of the experience so I

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:23.740
the focus of kind of the experience so I
 

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:24.809
the focus of kind of the experience so I
mentioned like prototyping plays a

00:07:24.809 --> 00:07:24.819
mentioned like prototyping plays a
 

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:26.369
mentioned like prototyping plays a
significant role in this as well right

00:07:26.369 --> 00:07:26.379
significant role in this as well right
 

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:27.839
significant role in this as well right
you guys are trying to put things in

00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:27.849
you guys are trying to put things in
 

00:07:27.849 --> 00:07:29.219
you guys are trying to put things in

figuring out what makes what makes sense

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:31.060
figuring out what makes what makes sense

figuring out what makes what makes sense
what's the what's the razor for you guys

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:33.520
what's the what's the razor for you guys
 

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.579
what's the what's the razor for you guys
between sort of talking and I about an

00:07:35.579 --> 00:07:35.589
between sort of talking and I about an
 

00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:36.779
between sort of talking and I about an
idea and being convinced that it's worth

00:07:36.779 --> 00:07:36.789
idea and being convinced that it's worth
 

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:42.749
idea and being convinced that it's worth
building that's a really tough question

00:07:42.749 --> 00:07:42.759
building that's a really tough question
 

00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:45.600
building that's a really tough question
because right now VR is a brand new

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:45.610
because right now VR is a brand new
 

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:47.399
because right now VR is a brand new
media if you come from kind of the film

00:07:47.399 --> 00:07:47.409
media if you come from kind of the film
 

00:07:47.409 --> 00:07:50.939
media if you come from kind of the film
television perspective that's a very

00:07:50.939 --> 00:07:50.949
television perspective that's a very
 

00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:53.639
television perspective that's a very
very well known vocabulary so if you go

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:53.649
very well known vocabulary so if you go
 

00:07:53.649 --> 00:07:54.929
very well known vocabulary so if you go
to film school anywhere in the world

00:07:54.929 --> 00:07:54.939
to film school anywhere in the world
 

00:07:54.939 --> 00:07:56.850
to film school anywhere in the world
they're gonna talk about hard cuts off

00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:56.860
they're gonna talk about hard cuts off
 

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.270
they're gonna talk about hard cuts off
cuts you know pan

00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:58.280
cuts you know pan
 

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.310
cuts you know pan
zooms all these types of things that is

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:00.320
zooms all these types of things that is
 

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.370
zooms all these types of things that is
the language of storytelling in film and

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:03.380
the language of storytelling in film and
 

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:07.810
the language of storytelling in film and
television and once you get to VR it's

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:07.820
television and once you get to VR it's
 

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.150
television and once you get to VR it's
all thrown out the window you're no

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:10.160
all thrown out the window you're no
 

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.800
all thrown out the window you're no
longer on a set you know how longer have

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:11.810
longer on a set you know how longer have
 

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:13.360
longer on a set you know how longer have
this window that you're looking through

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:13.370
this window that you're looking through
 

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:16.090
this window that you're looking through
you are now in the experience and

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:16.100
you are now in the experience and
 

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:17.470
you are now in the experience and
there's stuff that can happen all around

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:17.480
there's stuff that can happen all around
 

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:21.280
there's stuff that can happen all around
so a lot of that stuff is all new so I

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:21.290
so a lot of that stuff is all new so I
 

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:23.770
so a lot of that stuff is all new so I
don't it it's really hard to say there's

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:23.780
don't it it's really hard to say there's
 

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:27.400
don't it it's really hard to say there's
a well-defined process for right

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:27.410
a well-defined process for right
 

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:29.200
a well-defined process for right
determining whether it works or it

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:29.210
determining whether it works or it
 

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:31.390
determining whether it works or it
doesn't because it's all brand new and

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:31.400
doesn't because it's all brand new and
 

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.029
doesn't because it's all brand new and
so that's part of the excitement but

00:08:34.029 --> 00:08:34.039
so that's part of the excitement but
 

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:35.680
so that's part of the excitement but
also the challenge of working in this

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:35.690
also the challenge of working in this
 

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:37.750
also the challenge of working in this
medium totally getting getting it in

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:37.760
medium totally getting getting it in
 

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.070
medium totally getting getting it in
people's hands like as quickly as

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:39.080
people's hands like as quickly as
 

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.440
people's hands like as quickly as
possible has really been our our biggest

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:41.450
possible has really been our our biggest
 

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:43.870
possible has really been our our biggest
thing and it's hard I mean like you are

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:43.880
thing and it's hard I mean like you are
 

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.910
thing and it's hard I mean like you are
dealing with so many different problems

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:45.920
dealing with so many different problems
 

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:46.690
dealing with so many different problems
and things you're trying to overcome

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:46.700
and things you're trying to overcome
 

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.670
and things you're trying to overcome
during development and you don't often

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:48.680
during development and you don't often
 

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.320
during development and you don't often
have time to throw it at people but like

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:50.330
have time to throw it at people but like
 

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:51.820
have time to throw it at people but like
the sooner you can get in some of these

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:51.830
the sooner you can get in some of these
 

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:53.770
the sooner you can get in some of these
hands and like really find out what's

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:53.780
hands and like really find out what's
 

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.930
hands and like really find out what's
working and what's not like you know

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:55.940
working and what's not like you know
 

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:58.510
working and what's not like you know
there there are like I mean everybody

00:08:58.510 --> 00:08:58.520
there there are like I mean everybody
 

00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:59.620
there there are like I mean everybody
always wants to develop their best

00:08:59.620 --> 00:08:59.630
always wants to develop their best
 

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:01.060
always wants to develop their best
practices for everything but I think

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:01.070
practices for everything but I think
 

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:04.420
practices for everything but I think
like we're not quite there yet for VR

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:04.430
like we're not quite there yet for VR
 

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:05.620
like we're not quite there yet for VR
they're like there are certain things

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:05.630
they're like there are certain things
 

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:08.050
they're like there are certain things
here and there that we like have learned

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:08.060
here and there that we like have learned
 

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.520
here and there that we like have learned
ourselves or heard from other developers

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:09.530
ourselves or heard from other developers
 

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:11.230
ourselves or heard from other developers
or whatever that we can try to avoid or

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:11.240
or whatever that we can try to avoid or
 

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.020
or whatever that we can try to avoid or
or specifically do because it makes

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:14.030
or specifically do because it makes
 

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:16.480
or specifically do because it makes
things better but like I think like

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:16.490
things better but like I think like
 

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:18.400
things better but like I think like
those rules are not hard and fast they

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:18.410
those rules are not hard and fast they
 

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:20.020
those rules are not hard and fast they
don't work in every situation something

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:20.030
don't work in every situation something
 

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:21.940
don't work in every situation something
that actually feels good in one

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:21.950
that actually feels good in one
 

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:23.500
that actually feels good in one
situation might feel terrible in another

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:23.510
situation might feel terrible in another
 

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:26.740
situation might feel terrible in another
and so like it's it's really just about

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:26.750
and so like it's it's really just about
 

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:28.990
and so like it's it's really just about
how other people react and and you know

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:29.000
how other people react and and you know
 

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
how other people react and and you know
it's the same I mean like no matter what

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:31.010
it's the same I mean like no matter what
 

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:32.470
it's the same I mean like no matter what
you're developing whether it's VR or not

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:32.480
you're developing whether it's VR or not
 

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.960
you're developing whether it's VR or not
like you are looking at this thing that

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:34.970
like you are looking at this thing that
 

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:37.210
like you are looking at this thing that
you're creating for so many hours that

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:37.220
you're creating for so many hours that
 

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.970
you're creating for so many hours that
it's hard to have any kind of

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:39.980
it's hard to have any kind of
 

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.800
it's hard to have any kind of
perspective on it until you see somebody

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:41.810
perspective on it until you see somebody
 

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:45.130
perspective on it until you see somebody
else react to it and I would say there's

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:45.140
else react to it and I would say there's
 

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:48.220
else react to it and I would say there's
a lot of stuff that when you come out of

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:48.230
a lot of stuff that when you come out of
 

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:49.600
a lot of stuff that when you come out of
the film and television or the video

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:49.610
the film and television or the video
 

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:51.070
the film and television or the video
game industry that actually is

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:51.080
game industry that actually is
 

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.860
game industry that actually is
applicable so we actually do do

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:53.870
applicable so we actually do do
 

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:56.290
applicable so we actually do do
storyboards even though those are

00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:56.300
storyboards even though those are
 

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:58.450
storyboards even though those are
obviously 2d versus not an immersive

00:09:58.450 --> 00:09:58.460
obviously 2d versus not an immersive
 

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.960
obviously 2d versus not an immersive
environment there is kind of a pacing in

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:01.970
environment there is kind of a pacing in
 

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:04.360
environment there is kind of a pacing in
a way to direct the scene even though

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:04.370
a way to direct the scene even though
 

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:06.850
a way to direct the scene even though
it's immersive and I'd say the the

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:06.860
it's immersive and I'd say the the
 

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.130
it's immersive and I'd say the the
beauty of what game engines like unity

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:09.140
beauty of what game engines like unity
 

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:10.630
beauty of what game engines like unity
are doing right now they call it the

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:10.640
are doing right now they call it the
 

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:11.610
are doing right now they call it the
real-time rebel

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:11.620
real-time rebel
 

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:14.370
real-time rebel
is the traditional animation process was

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:14.380
is the traditional animation process was
 

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.110
is the traditional animation process was
animating in Maya and then going into

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:16.120
animating in Maya and then going into
 

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.640
animating in Maya and then going into
render man and you'd have to wait

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:17.650
render man and you'd have to wait
 

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:19.620
render man and you'd have to wait
forever for this stuff to be rendered

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:19.630
forever for this stuff to be rendered
 

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:21.750
forever for this stuff to be rendered
out and then you'd look at it and go wow

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:21.760
out and then you'd look at it and go wow
 

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.160
out and then you'd look at it and go wow
that's not right and then you go back

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:23.170
that's not right and then you go back
 

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:25.230
that's not right and then you go back
and you have to redo it where is our

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:25.240
and you have to redo it where is our
 

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.050
and you have to redo it where is our
developers can sit just like is normal

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:28.060
developers can sit just like is normal
 

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.330
developers can sit just like is normal
in the video game business where you'd

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:30.340
in the video game business where you'd
 

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:33.660
in the video game business where you'd
be like why it's not normal they put on

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:33.670
be like why it's not normal they put on
 

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:36.240
be like why it's not normal they put on
their headset and they do their oh I

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:36.250
their headset and they do their oh I
 

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:37.770
their headset and they do their oh I
need to put a cup on the table oh I

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:37.780
need to put a cup on the table oh I
 

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.390
need to put a cup on the table oh I
should have this character come in from

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:39.400
should have this character come in from
 

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.440
should have this character come in from
here and they can go and make those

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:40.450
here and they can go and make those
 

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:42.480
here and they can go and make those
changes in real time and see it right

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:42.490
changes in real time and see it right
 

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:45.660
changes in real time and see it right
away and so that rapid prototyping is is

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:45.670
away and so that rapid prototyping is is
 

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:49.080
away and so that rapid prototyping is is
new for the animation industry but I

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:49.090
new for the animation industry but I
 

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:50.580
new for the animation industry but I
think very comfortable for the video

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:50.590
think very comfortable for the video
 

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:53.430
think very comfortable for the video
game industry yeah I think like we spent

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:53.440
game industry yeah I think like we spent
 

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.720
game industry yeah I think like we spent
a lot of time doing a lot of rapid

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:54.730
a lot of time doing a lot of rapid
 

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:56.370
a lot of time doing a lot of rapid
prototyping like game jams and like all

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:56.380
prototyping like game jams and like all
 

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.540
prototyping like game jams and like all
that kind of stuff just to like try

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:57.550
that kind of stuff just to like try
 

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:59.130
that kind of stuff just to like try
ideas out really quickly and kind of

00:10:59.130 --> 00:10:59.140
ideas out really quickly and kind of
 

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:00.390
ideas out really quickly and kind of
throw them out and actually like

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:00.400
throw them out and actually like
 

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.150
throw them out and actually like
storyboarding is kind of like one of the

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:03.160
storyboarding is kind of like one of the
 

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.230
storyboarding is kind of like one of the
things that we had a hard time with it

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.240
things that we had a hard time with it
 

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.140
things that we had a hard time with it
first two is like just figuring out how

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:07.150
first two is like just figuring out how
 

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:08.820
first two is like just figuring out how
to like layout the space I remember our

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:08.830
to like layout the space I remember our
 

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:11.130
to like layout the space I remember our
artists like I was like hey we need like

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:11.140
artists like I was like hey we need like
 

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:12.810
artists like I was like hey we need like
a storyboard for this moment here kind

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:12.820
a storyboard for this moment here kind
 

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:14.700
a storyboard for this moment here kind
of the beats like you know figure out

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:14.710
of the beats like you know figure out
 

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:16.470
of the beats like you know figure out
what you want this look like and he's

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:16.480
what you want this look like and he's
 

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.880
what you want this look like and he's
drawing everything and he's like tiny

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:17.890
drawing everything and he's like tiny
 

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:19.710
drawing everything and he's like tiny
squares and shots and camera angles I'm

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:19.720
squares and shots and camera angles I'm
 

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:24.540
squares and shots and camera angles I'm
like no like hey I basically had to go

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:24.550
like no like hey I basically had to go
 

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:26.940
like no like hey I basically had to go
back in and like redraw the frames for

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:26.950
back in and like redraw the frames for
 

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:28.500
back in and like redraw the frames for
him but like very lightly and I was like

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:28.510
him but like very lightly and I was like
 

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:29.640
him but like very lightly and I was like
you know what feel free to draw outside

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:29.650
you know what feel free to draw outside
 

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:31.800
you know what feel free to draw outside
this you know think about how this whole

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:31.810
this you know think about how this whole
 

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:33.750
this you know think about how this whole
space feels and that really helped at

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:33.760
space feels and that really helped at
 

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.940
space feels and that really helped at
the time but now actually like seeing

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:35.950
the time but now actually like seeing
 

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:37.920
the time but now actually like seeing
things like Google blocks and like you

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:37.930
things like Google blocks and like you
 

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:39.510
things like Google blocks and like you
know unity is starting to do some of

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:39.520
know unity is starting to do some of
 

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.000
know unity is starting to do some of
their real-time VR editing tools and

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:42.010
their real-time VR editing tools and
 

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:43.740
their real-time VR editing tools and
stuff like that do you guys use that for

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:43.750
stuff like that do you guys use that for
 

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:45.840
stuff like that do you guys use that for
like laying stuff out we've used both

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:45.850
like laying stuff out we've used both
 

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:47.640
like laying stuff out we've used both
unreal and unity and we're currently

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:47.650
unreal and unity and we're currently
 

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:50.220
unreal and unity and we're currently
building our our current two pieces on

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:50.230
building our our current two pieces on
 

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:52.110
building our our current two pieces on
unity and so we use their Timeline

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:52.120
unity and so we use their Timeline
 

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.600
unity and so we use their Timeline
feature heavily yeah I bet and there's a

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:54.610
feature heavily yeah I bet and there's a
 

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:55.950
feature heavily yeah I bet and there's a
lot of really interesting things that

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:55.960
lot of really interesting things that
 

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.050
lot of really interesting things that
they're disrupting again in the

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:58.060
they're disrupting again in the
 

00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:59.670
they're disrupting again in the
traditional animation industry but it's

00:11:59.670 --> 00:11:59.680
traditional animation industry but it's
 

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.130
traditional animation industry but it's
quite comfortable for games it's it's

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:02.140
quite comfortable for games it's it's
 

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.070
quite comfortable for games it's it's
crazy I really wanted my hands more on

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:05.080
crazy I really wanted my hands more on
 

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.870
crazy I really wanted my hands more on
like actually editing scenes in VR cuz

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:06.880
like actually editing scenes in VR cuz
 

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.190
like actually editing scenes in VR cuz
actually like one of the hardest things

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:08.200
actually like one of the hardest things
 

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:12.270
actually like one of the hardest things
that I've I is like starting a new level

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:12.280
that I've I is like starting a new level
 

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.790
that I've I is like starting a new level
and really understanding what the scale

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:14.800
and really understanding what the scale
 

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.160
and really understanding what the scale
of that place feels like compared to

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:17.170
of that place feels like compared to
 

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:19.380
of that place feels like compared to
yourself we do a lot of like scaling up

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:19.390
yourself we do a lot of like scaling up
 

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:21.000
yourself we do a lot of like scaling up
and down of the character to like do the

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:21.010
and down of the character to like do the
 

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:22.800
and down of the character to like do the
toy box effect like you're talking about

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:22.810
toy box effect like you're talking about
 

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:25.570
toy box effect like you're talking about
so like we don't always it

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:25.580
so like we don't always it
 

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.040
so like we don't always it
hard to like imagine until you're

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:27.050
hard to like imagine until you're
 

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:28.600
hard to like imagine until you're
actually in it like what the scale of

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:28.610
actually in it like what the scale of
 

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:30.280
actually in it like what the scale of
that thing will be or boarding you know

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:30.290
that thing will be or boarding you know
 

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:31.480
that thing will be or boarding you know
there are companies out there developing

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:31.490
there are companies out there developing
 

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:34.210
there are companies out there developing
tools and people have tools internally

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:34.220
tools and people have tools internally
 

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.280
tools and people have tools internally
to do storyboarding and VR and that's

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:36.290
to do storyboarding and VR and that's
 

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:38.050
to do storyboarding and VR and that's
that's kind of some of the rapid

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:38.060
that's kind of some of the rapid
 

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:39.460
that's kind of some of the rapid
prototyping tools that are being

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:39.470
prototyping tools that are being
 

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:41.050
prototyping tools that are being
developed and used to out there right

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:41.060
developed and used to out there right
 

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:41.890
developed and used to out there right
now yeah

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:41.900
now yeah
 

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.780
now yeah
really helps so we have these these

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:43.790
really helps so we have these these
 

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:45.880
really helps so we have these these
rapid prototyping tools that allow us to

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:45.890
rapid prototyping tools that allow us to
 

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:47.350
rapid prototyping tools that allow us to
visualize things far more quickly an

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:47.360
visualize things far more quickly an
 

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.940
visualize things far more quickly an
experiment far more quickly which is

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:48.950
experiment far more quickly which is
 

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:51.100
experiment far more quickly which is
clearly a benefit to animation and games

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:51.110
clearly a benefit to animation and games
 

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:52.690
clearly a benefit to animation and games
as you guys have been going through this

00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:52.700
as you guys have been going through this
 

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:54.760
as you guys have been going through this
rapid prototyping phase and you're

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:54.770
rapid prototyping phase and you're
 

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:56.140
rapid prototyping phase and you're
actually kind of moving from that

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:56.150
actually kind of moving from that
 

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:57.340
actually kind of moving from that
prototyping phase into building your

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:57.350
prototyping phase into building your
 

00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:59.410
prototyping phase into building your
products what are what are some of the

00:12:59.410 --> 00:12:59.420
products what are what are some of the
 

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:01.210
products what are what are some of the
biggest mistakes you've made trying to

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:01.220
biggest mistakes you've made trying to
 

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:02.770
biggest mistakes you've made trying to
author content in this new medium right

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:02.780
author content in this new medium right
 

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:05.290
author content in this new medium right
obviously there's the setting people

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:05.300
obviously there's the setting people
 

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.690
obviously there's the setting people
have a couch to be sick for a while when

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:07.700
have a couch to be sick for a while when
 

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:10.240

things don't go super well what are some

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:10.250
things don't go super well what are some
 

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:13.780
things don't go super well what are some
others I'd say for us it's it's being

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:13.790
others I'd say for us it's it's being
 

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:16.720
others I'd say for us it's it's being
heavy-handed with the the users it's

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:16.730
heavy-handed with the the users it's
 

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:18.820
heavy-handed with the the users it's
pretty interesting because you have to

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:18.830
pretty interesting because you have to
 

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:22.480
pretty interesting because you have to
kind of prepare for everything from an

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:22.490
kind of prepare for everything from an
 

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:24.790
kind of prepare for everything from an
experienced VR user which there are

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:24.800
experienced VR user which there are
 

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.010
experienced VR user which there are
shockingly few out there right now just

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:27.020
shockingly few out there right now just
 

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:28.540
shockingly few out there right now just

to complete newbies and so you'll find

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:31.670
to complete newbies and so you'll find
 

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:33.520
to complete newbies and so you'll find
people who will just jump in the

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:33.530
people who will just jump in the
 

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:35.380
people who will just jump in the
experience and though this start staring

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:35.390
experience and though this start staring
 

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:37.990
experience and though this start staring
off into the distance or they won't even

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.000
off into the distance or they won't even
 

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:45.400
off into the distance or they won't even
move their head and you have to kind of

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:45.410
move their head and you have to kind of
 

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:47.590
move their head and you have to kind of
plan for all those but I think a core

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:47.600
plan for all those but I think a core
 

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.840
plan for all those but I think a core
learning is that people just like in

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:49.850
learning is that people just like in
 

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:51.960
learning is that people just like in
every other media media they don't

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:51.970
every other media media they don't
 

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:55.180
every other media media they don't
really like to be forced what to do so

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:55.190
really like to be forced what to do so
 

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:57.880
really like to be forced what to do so
you have to kind of entice them to do

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:57.890
you have to kind of entice them to do
 

00:13:57.890 --> 00:13:59.950
you have to kind of entice them to do
the things that you want so that they

00:13:59.950 --> 00:13:59.960
the things that you want so that they
 

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.290
the things that you want so that they
can experience the story as it was meant

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:02.300
can experience the story as it was meant
 

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.990
can experience the story as it was meant
to be just told in our case so

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:05.000
to be just told in our case so
 

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.150
to be just told in our case so
heavy-handed things of like forcing them

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:07.160
heavy-handed things of like forcing them
 

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.610
heavy-handed things of like forcing them
into a position or doing something or

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:09.620
into a position or doing something or
 

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.260
into a position or doing something or
not allowing them to interact with

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:11.270
not allowing them to interact with
 

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:13.630
not allowing them to interact with
something has been less well-received

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:13.640
something has been less well-received
 

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:16.450
something has been less well-received
versus others audio is like a huge thing

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:16.460
versus others audio is like a huge thing
 

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:20.230
versus others audio is like a huge thing
for that right yes audio characters you

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:20.240
for that right yes audio characters you
 

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.630
for that right yes audio characters you
know we often say one of the things you

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:22.640
know we often say one of the things you
 

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.090
know we often say one of the things you
can do in VR is think like a magician if

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:25.100
can do in VR is think like a magician if
 

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:27.160
can do in VR is think like a magician if
you want the audience to look at you you

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:27.170
you want the audience to look at you you
 

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:29.290
you want the audience to look at you you
look at the audience if you want them to

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:29.300
look at the audience if you want them to
 

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.590
look at the audience if you want them to
look at something else you look at that

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:31.600
look at something else you look at that
 

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.290
look at something else you look at that
that happens in if you a big expressive

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:34.300
that happens in if you a big expressive
 

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:36.629
that happens in if you a big expressive
characters that's fairly easy to achieve

00:14:36.629 --> 00:14:36.639
characters that's fairly easy to achieve
 

00:14:36.639 --> 00:14:40.680
characters that's fairly easy to achieve
and then obviously audio cues it's a

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:40.690
and then obviously audio cues it's a
 

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:41.879
and then obviously audio cues it's a
little challenging with the audio

00:14:41.879 --> 00:14:41.889
little challenging with the audio
 

00:14:41.889 --> 00:14:43.620
little challenging with the audio
because not everything works that well

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:43.630
because not everything works that well
 

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:45.449
because not everything works that well
and spatialized audio not everybody has

00:14:45.449 --> 00:14:45.459
and spatialized audio not everybody has
 

00:14:45.459 --> 00:14:47.999
and spatialized audio not everybody has
you know right high tech headsets

00:14:47.999 --> 00:14:48.009
you know right high tech headsets
 

00:14:48.009 --> 00:14:50.430
you know right high tech headsets
you know actually mobile or something so

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:50.440
you know actually mobile or something so
 

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.139
you know actually mobile or something so
you've got to be able to kind of span

00:14:52.139 --> 00:14:52.149
you've got to be able to kind of span
 

00:14:52.149 --> 00:14:55.170
you've got to be able to kind of span
that gap and I think just like in games

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:55.180
that gap and I think just like in games
 

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.509
that gap and I think just like in games
you you know it often helps to kind of

00:14:57.509 --> 00:14:57.519
you you know it often helps to kind of
 

00:14:57.519 --> 00:14:58.730
you you know it often helps to kind of
think of the lowest common denominator

00:14:58.730 --> 00:14:58.740
think of the lowest common denominator
 

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:02.189
think of the lowest common denominator
and build up from there yeah I think

00:15:02.189 --> 00:15:02.199
and build up from there yeah I think
 

00:15:02.199 --> 00:15:06.629
and build up from there yeah I think
like in actually maybe I you would

00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:06.639
like in actually maybe I you would
 

00:15:06.639 --> 00:15:07.800
like in actually maybe I you would
probably hate me for this but it's like

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:07.810
probably hate me for this but it's like
 

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:09.269
probably hate me for this but it's like
one of one of the things that we have

00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:09.279
one of one of the things that we have
 

00:15:09.279 --> 00:15:12.300
one of one of the things that we have
like have traditionally had problems

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:12.310
like have traditionally had problems
 

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:13.800
like have traditionally had problems
with in the past is actually like our

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:13.810
with in the past is actually like our
 

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:16.079
with in the past is actually like our
character interaction moments we've

00:15:16.079 --> 00:15:16.089
character interaction moments we've
 

00:15:16.089 --> 00:15:18.269
character interaction moments we've
definitely like we spent a lot a lot of

00:15:18.269 --> 00:15:18.279
definitely like we spent a lot a lot of
 

00:15:18.279 --> 00:15:21.150
definitely like we spent a lot a lot of
time prototyping like interactions and

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:21.160
time prototyping like interactions and
 

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.749
time prototyping like interactions and
gameplay mechanics and we still very

00:15:24.749 --> 00:15:24.759
gameplay mechanics and we still very
 

00:15:24.759 --> 00:15:26.730
gameplay mechanics and we still very
much value characters and narrative and

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:26.740
much value characters and narrative and
 

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:27.840
much value characters and narrative and
all that kind of stuff but like we do

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:27.850
all that kind of stuff but like we do
 

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:29.629
all that kind of stuff but like we do
come from a gaming background and like

00:15:29.629 --> 00:15:29.639
come from a gaming background and like
 

00:15:29.639 --> 00:15:32.490
come from a gaming background and like
and so we definitely have had times in

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:32.500
and so we definitely have had times in
 

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.620
and so we definitely have had times in
some of our products where like you know

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:34.630
some of our products where like you know
 

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:36.090
some of our products where like you know
we don't prototype our character

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:36.100
we don't prototype our character
 

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:39.150
we don't prototype our character
interactions early enough yeah and some

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:39.160
interactions early enough yeah and some
 

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.379
interactions early enough yeah and some
of them end up working and it's great

00:15:40.379 --> 00:15:40.389
of them end up working and it's great
 

00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:42.179
of them end up working and it's great
and yeah but like we've we've definitely

00:15:42.179 --> 00:15:42.189
and yeah but like we've we've definitely
 

00:15:42.189 --> 00:15:43.650
and yeah but like we've we've definitely
had moments where we build it out this

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:43.660
had moments where we build it out this
 

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:44.999
had moments where we build it out this
whole character interaction I'm like in

00:15:44.999 --> 00:15:45.009
whole character interaction I'm like in
 

00:15:45.009 --> 00:15:46.170
whole character interaction I'm like in
my head I'm like this is gonna be great

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:46.180
my head I'm like this is gonna be great
 

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:48.449
my head I'm like this is gonna be great
it's gonna be awesome and then like it

00:15:48.449 --> 00:15:48.459
it's gonna be awesome and then like it
 

00:15:48.459 --> 00:15:50.639
it's gonna be awesome and then like it
totally flops you know and now now

00:15:50.639 --> 00:15:50.649
totally flops you know and now now
 

00:15:50.649 --> 00:15:52.590
totally flops you know and now now
you're like dang I have to restructure

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:52.600
you're like dang I have to restructure
 

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:59.129
you're like dang I have to restructure
my whole like story a little moment so

00:15:59.129 --> 00:15:59.139
my whole like story a little moment so

we're just releasing this holiday as you
actually follow the two aliens where

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:02.920
actually follow the two aliens where
 

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.949
actually follow the two aliens where
we're in the first piece invasion who

00:16:04.949 --> 00:16:04.959
we're in the first piece invasion who
 

00:16:04.959 --> 00:16:06.540
we're in the first piece invasion who
came down invaded earth and we're

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:06.550
came down invaded earth and we're
 

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:08.040
came down invaded earth and we're
repelled by a cute little bunny Chloe

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:08.050
repelled by a cute little bunny Chloe
 

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:10.230
repelled by a cute little bunny Chloe
you follow them to their ship in outer

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:10.240
you follow them to their ship in outer
 

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.870
you follow them to their ship in outer
space and we found like when we first

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:12.880
space and we found like when we first
 

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.790
space and we found like when we first
put people out there you play actually a

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:14.800
put people out there you play actually a
 

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.220
put people out there you play actually a
helper robot on the ship and we gave you

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:17.230
helper robot on the ship and we gave you
 

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:19.379
helper robot on the ship and we gave you
like robotic hands and people just start

00:16:19.379 --> 00:16:19.389
like robotic hands and people just start
 

00:16:19.389 --> 00:16:21.030
like robotic hands and people just start
running around the ship jamming their

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.040
running around the ship jamming their
 

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.100
running around the ship jamming their
hands into various places thinking there

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:23.110
hands into various places thinking there
 

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:24.540
hands into various places thinking there
were r2d2 and they were gonna take over

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:24.550
were r2d2 and they were gonna take over
 

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:26.519
were r2d2 and they were gonna take over
control this year there's gonna be some

00:16:26.519 --> 00:16:26.529
control this year there's gonna be some
 

00:16:26.529 --> 00:16:28.199
control this year there's gonna be some
Easter eggs somewhere yeah and

00:16:28.199 --> 00:16:28.209
Easter eggs somewhere yeah and
 

00:16:28.209 --> 00:16:30.540
Easter eggs somewhere yeah and
completely missing the the narrative

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:30.550
completely missing the the narrative
 

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:33.269
completely missing the the narrative
yeah taking you know kind of the ball

00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:33.279
yeah taking you know kind of the ball
 

00:16:33.279 --> 00:16:35.129
yeah taking you know kind of the ball
that you could play fetch with a dog and

00:16:35.129 --> 00:16:35.139
that you could play fetch with a dog and
 

00:16:35.139 --> 00:16:37.379
that you could play fetch with a dog and
like hitting things trying to beat the

00:16:37.379 --> 00:16:37.389
like hitting things trying to beat the
 

00:16:37.389 --> 00:16:39.449
like hitting things trying to beat the
characters you know it's right it's a

00:16:39.449 --> 00:16:39.459
characters you know it's right it's a
 

00:16:39.459 --> 00:16:41.370
characters you know it's right it's a
very very interesting thing to run

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:41.380
very very interesting thing to run
 

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:42.720
very very interesting thing to run
through yeah you give somebody a ball to

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:42.730
through yeah you give somebody a ball to
 

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:43.920
through yeah you give somebody a ball to
play fetch with a dog and then they go

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:43.930
play fetch with a dog and then they go
 

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:44.700
play fetch with a dog and then they go
try to murder ever

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:44.710
try to murder ever
 

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:47.640
try to murder ever
thing with one of the things that

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:47.650
thing with one of the things that
 

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:48.780
thing with one of the things that
strikes me as you guys are talking about

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:48.790
strikes me as you guys are talking about
 

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:51.000
strikes me as you guys are talking about
this is is how some of the most profound

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:51.010
this is is how some of the most profound
 

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:52.890
this is is how some of the most profound
moments in your products at least for me

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:52.900
moments in your products at least for me
 

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.290
moments in your products at least for me
have been some of the most simple in

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:55.300
have been some of the most simple in
 

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:57.510
have been some of the most simple in
some ways right like envision is always

00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:57.520
some ways right like envision is always
 

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.070
some ways right like envision is always
one of the first VR experiences I show

00:16:59.070 --> 00:16:59.080
one of the first VR experiences I show
 

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.600
one of the first VR experiences I show
somebody and it's it's largely because

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:00.610
somebody and it's it's largely because
 

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:02.490
somebody and it's it's largely because
you have that moment where Chloe

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:02.500
you have that moment where Chloe
 

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:03.600
you have that moment where Chloe
I guess the buddy it just comes like

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:03.610
I guess the buddy it just comes like
 

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:05.640
I guess the buddy it just comes like
running right up to you and slides right

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:05.650
running right up to you and slides right
 

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:07.350
running right up to you and slides right
into your body and you really have this

00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:07.360
into your body and you really have this
 

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.810
into your body and you really have this
moment of eye contact which is

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:08.820
moment of eye contact which is
 

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:10.890
moment of eye contact which is
incredibly powerful and it's like the

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:10.900
incredibly powerful and it's like the
 

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:12.030
incredibly powerful and it's like the
first medium I can think of where you

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:12.040
first medium I can think of where you
 

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.660
first medium I can think of where you
have eye contact and then similarly with

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:14.670
have eye contact and then similarly with
 

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:17.040
have eye contact and then similarly with
with along together the first really

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:17.050
with along together the first really
 

00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:18.150
with along together the first really
interaction you have in the game is just

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:18.160
interaction you have in the game is just
 

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.860
interaction you have in the game is just
waving to another character and how

00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:19.870
waving to another character and how
 

00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:21.060
waving to another character and how
enduring that is and how much it

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:21.070
enduring that is and how much it
 

00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:23.550
enduring that is and how much it
connects you to those characters have

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:23.560
connects you to those characters have
 

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:25.020
connects you to those characters have
you guys noticed a theme of simplicity

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:25.030
you guys noticed a theme of simplicity
 

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:26.780
you guys noticed a theme of simplicity
and these interactions that feels

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:26.790
and these interactions that feels
 

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:28.800
and these interactions that feels
important are you noticing that users

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:28.810
important are you noticing that users
 

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:30.180
important are you noticing that users
are growing into more complex

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:30.190
are growing into more complex
 

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:31.590
are growing into more complex
interactions as they continue to

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:31.600
interactions as they continue to
 

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.680
interactions as they continue to
progress through more VR content I think

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:34.690
progress through more VR content I think
 

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:40.170
progress through more VR content I think
like there's something about like simple

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:40.180
like there's something about like simple
 

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:41.760
like there's something about like simple
interaction so that like immediately

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:41.770
interaction so that like immediately
 

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:44.100
interaction so that like immediately
connect with people you know it doesn't

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:44.110
connect with people you know it doesn't
 

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:45.300
connect with people you know it doesn't
matter I like I don't think anybody's

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:45.310
matter I like I don't think anybody's
 

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:47.670
matter I like I don't think anybody's
sitting there going like oh man I'm like

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:47.680
sitting there going like oh man I'm like
 

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.380
sitting there going like oh man I'm like
bored of wait actually it might it might

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:49.390
bored of wait actually it might it might
 

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:50.520
bored of wait actually it might it might
get to that point now that I think about

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:50.530
get to that point now that I think about
 

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:52.110
get to that point now that I think about
it like if we have too many moments of

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:52.120
it like if we have too many moments of
 

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:53.310
it like if we have too many moments of
like you wave to this character it's

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:53.320
like you wave to this character it's
 

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.960
like you wave to this character it's
like okay like yeah I've done this in

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:54.970
like okay like yeah I've done this in
 

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:58.050
like okay like yeah I've done this in
the AR before like that's fine you know

00:17:58.050 --> 00:17:58.060
the AR before like that's fine you know
 

00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:02.880
the AR before like that's fine you know
no but I think so far it's been not so

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:02.890
no but I think so far it's been not so
 

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:07.140
no but I think so far it's been not so
much about like just like trying to be

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:07.150
much about like just like trying to be
 

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:08.280
much about like just like trying to be
like oh this is like a simple

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:08.290
like oh this is like a simple
 

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:09.660
like oh this is like a simple
interaction that'll be cool it's just

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:09.670
interaction that'll be cool it's just
 

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:13.320
interaction that'll be cool it's just
like what sells that moment and we're

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:13.330
like what sells that moment and we're
 

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:14.790
like what sells that moment and we're
not really necessarily worrying about

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:14.800
not really necessarily worrying about
 

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:17.640
not really necessarily worrying about
like how complex it should be I mean

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:17.650
like how complex it should be I mean
 

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:19.530
like how complex it should be I mean
especially for the very beginning of

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:19.540
especially for the very beginning of
 

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:21.810
especially for the very beginning of
sequence right like character looks at

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:21.820
sequence right like character looks at
 

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:23.490
sequence right like character looks at
you you wave at them like really like

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:23.500
you you wave at them like really like
 

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:25.050
you you wave at them like really like
pulling somebody into that experience

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:25.060
pulling somebody into that experience
 

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:27.750
pulling somebody into that experience
like you have to do something that is

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:27.760
like you have to do something that is
 

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:32.550
like you have to do something that is
like minimally or it's easy understand

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:32.560
like minimally or it's easy understand
 

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:36.630
like minimally or it's easy understand
and like as impactful as possible I feel

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:36.640
and like as impactful as possible I feel
 

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:37.800
and like as impactful as possible I feel
like I'm talking in circles a little bit

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:37.810
like I'm talking in circles a little bit
 

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:39.960
like I'm talking in circles a little bit
but I think like that is like that is

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:39.970
but I think like that is like that is
 

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:43.110
but I think like that is like that is
really key to especially as we are

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:43.120
really key to especially as we are
 

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.390
really key to especially as we are
getting mostly new users into VR like we

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:45.400
getting mostly new users into VR like we
 

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.070
getting mostly new users into VR like we
don't really make games assuming that

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:47.080
don't really make games assuming that
 

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.590
don't really make games assuming that
people have played VR before like we are

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:49.600
people have played VR before like we are
 

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.480
people have played VR before like we are
talking we're you know we're still

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:51.490
talking we're you know we're still
 

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:53.700
talking we're you know we're still
assuming like that this might be the

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:53.710
assuming like that this might be the
 

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:55.350
assuming like that this might be the
first time somebody is ever picking this

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:55.360
first time somebody is ever picking this
 

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.990
first time somebody is ever picking this
up so how do we make it as easy to get

00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:58.000
up so how do we make it as easy to get
 

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.830
up so how do we make it as easy to get
into as

00:18:59.830 --> 00:18:59.840
into as
 

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.180
into as
I don't think it's necessarily a

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:01.190
I don't think it's necessarily a
 

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:03.759
I don't think it's necessarily a
simplistic thing it's I mean the the

00:19:03.759 --> 00:19:03.769
simplistic thing it's I mean the the
 

00:19:03.769 --> 00:19:06.190
simplistic thing it's I mean the the
kind of magic of Chloe coming up to you

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:06.200
kind of magic of Chloe coming up to you
 

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.289
kind of magic of Chloe coming up to you
and bouncing around it's amazing to

00:19:08.289 --> 00:19:08.299
and bouncing around it's amazing to
 

00:19:08.299 --> 00:19:10.600
and bouncing around it's amazing to
watch people like you'll see people like

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:10.610
watch people like you'll see people like
 

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:12.399
watch people like you'll see people like
start hopping around on the floor trying

00:19:12.399 --> 00:19:12.409
start hopping around on the floor trying
 

00:19:12.409 --> 00:19:14.380
start hopping around on the floor trying
to jump back and forth and they're like

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:14.390
to jump back and forth and they're like
 

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:18.130
to jump back and forth and they're like
oh my god the AI behind that she's like

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:18.140
oh my god the AI behind that she's like
 

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:19.810
oh my god the AI behind that she's like
reacting to me and playing way like no

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:19.820
reacting to me and playing way like no
 

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:21.880
reacting to me and playing way like no
that's actually just a simple hop back

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:21.890
that's actually just a simple hop back
 

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:23.769
that's actually just a simple hop back
and forth there was eye tracking in

00:19:23.769 --> 00:19:23.779
and forth there was eye tracking in
 

00:19:23.779 --> 00:19:26.769
and forth there was eye tracking in
there which helped a lot but the key

00:19:26.769 --> 00:19:26.779
there which helped a lot but the key
 

00:19:26.779 --> 00:19:29.230
there which helped a lot but the key
piece being that it's more that it feels

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:29.240
piece being that it's more that it feels
 

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:32.590
piece being that it's more that it feels
like real life and to dig deeper on that

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:32.600
like real life and to dig deeper on that
 

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:33.909
like real life and to dig deeper on that
it is not that it's necessarily

00:19:33.909 --> 00:19:33.919
it is not that it's necessarily
 

00:19:33.919 --> 00:19:36.039
it is not that it's necessarily
photorealistic because you are actually

00:19:36.039 --> 00:19:36.049
photorealistic because you are actually
 

00:19:36.049 --> 00:19:37.960
photorealistic because you are actually
a bunny and that's a bunny and it's

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:37.970
a bunny and that's a bunny and it's
 

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:40.360
a bunny and that's a bunny and it's
clearly not real life but it's that it

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:40.370
clearly not real life but it's that it
 

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:42.879
clearly not real life but it's that it
feels natural in terms of the way that

00:19:42.879 --> 00:19:42.889
feels natural in terms of the way that
 

00:19:42.889 --> 00:19:44.830
feels natural in terms of the way that
you actually interact in your day-to-day

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:44.840
you actually interact in your day-to-day
 

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:47.590
you actually interact in your day-to-day
life and that's what you're striving for

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:47.600
life and that's what you're striving for
 

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:48.460
life and that's what you're striving for
and that could be a simplistic

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:48.470
and that could be a simplistic
 

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:50.220
and that could be a simplistic
interaction it could be complex

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:50.230
interaction it could be complex
 

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:52.180
interaction it could be complex
obviously we're gonna probably stumble

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:52.190
obviously we're gonna probably stumble
 

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:53.799
obviously we're gonna probably stumble
across the more simplistic ones because

00:19:53.799 --> 00:19:53.809
across the more simplistic ones because
 

00:19:53.809 --> 00:19:55.269
across the more simplistic ones because
they're gonna be easier for us to figure

00:19:55.269 --> 00:19:55.279
they're gonna be easier for us to figure
 

00:19:55.279 --> 00:19:57.909
they're gonna be easier for us to figure
out right now but as the medium grows

00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919
out right now but as the medium grows
 

00:19:57.919 --> 00:19:59.950
out right now but as the medium grows
and gets better over time those will

00:19:59.950 --> 00:19:59.960
and gets better over time those will
 

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.169
and gets better over time those will
obviously become more complex but it's

00:20:02.169 --> 00:20:02.179
obviously become more complex but it's
 

00:20:02.179 --> 00:20:04.659
obviously become more complex but it's
that key of replicating the fuel of

00:20:04.659 --> 00:20:04.669
that key of replicating the fuel of
 

00:20:04.669 --> 00:20:07.330
that key of replicating the fuel of
light yeah and I think actually like

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:07.340
light yeah and I think actually like
 

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:09.310
light yeah and I think actually like
thinking about the interactions by

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:09.320
thinking about the interactions by
 

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:10.899
thinking about the interactions by
themselves like they might be very

00:20:10.899 --> 00:20:10.909
themselves like they might be very
 

00:20:10.909 --> 00:20:12.940
themselves like they might be very
simple but I think like they can be

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:12.950
simple but I think like they can be
 

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:15.490
simple but I think like they can be
emotionally complex yeah it's a great

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:15.500
emotionally complex yeah it's a great
 

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:15.789
emotionally complex yeah it's a great
point

00:20:15.789 --> 00:20:15.799
point
 

00:20:15.799 --> 00:20:17.320
point
yeah and that's those are that that's

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:17.330
yeah and that's those are that that's
 

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:19.330
yeah and that's those are that that's
what really feels good yeah that makes

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:19.340
what really feels good yeah that makes
 

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:21.250
what really feels good yeah that makes
total sense it's funny muchnick's I

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:21.260
total sense it's funny muchnick's I
 

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:23.080
total sense it's funny muchnick's I
think the the reaction I see from a lot

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:23.090
think the the reaction I see from a lot
 

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:24.490
think the the reaction I see from a lot
of people you can always tell when the

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:24.500
of people you can always tell when the
 

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:28.570
of people you can always tell when the
bunny is about to hit actually that's

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:28.580
bunny is about to hit actually that's
 

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:30.159
bunny is about to hit actually that's
kind of fun too is like intentionally

00:20:30.159 --> 00:20:30.169
kind of fun too is like intentionally
 

00:20:30.169 --> 00:20:31.389
kind of fun too is like intentionally
doing things that are like slightly

00:20:31.389 --> 00:20:31.399
doing things that are like slightly
 

00:20:31.399 --> 00:20:33.220
doing things that are like slightly
uncomfortable yeah like not in a

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:33.230
uncomfortable yeah like not in a
 

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:34.659
uncomfortable yeah like not in a
physical way but it's in a way that

00:20:34.659 --> 00:20:34.669
physical way but it's in a way that
 

00:20:34.669 --> 00:20:35.289
physical way but it's in a way that
maybe oh oh

00:20:35.289 --> 00:20:35.299
maybe oh oh
 

00:20:35.299 --> 00:20:36.759
maybe oh oh
like it really kind of wakes you up and

like right now it's it's it's a very
 

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:05.769
like right now it's it's it's a very
challenging time as a developer because

00:21:23.169 --> 00:21:23.179
and Google you know it's it's a much
 

00:21:23.179 --> 00:21:25.239
and Google you know it's it's a much
more limited universe and so that's

00:21:25.239 --> 00:21:25.249
more limited universe and so that's
 

00:21:25.249 --> 00:21:27.850
more limited universe and so that's
challenging I hope that goes away and

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:27.860
challenging I hope that goes away and
 

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:31.210

I think like for us the biggest thing
 

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:20.409
I think like for us the biggest thing
that we want to continue doing is like

00:22:20.409 --> 00:22:20.419
that we want to continue doing is like
 

00:22:20.419 --> 00:22:22.960
that we want to continue doing is like
character interaction which I'm you guys

like it has a lot of you automatically
 

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:30.310
like it has a lot of you automatically
get a lot of personality out of it you

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:30.320
get a lot of personality out of it you
 

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:33.489
get a lot of personality out of it you
get a more connected feeling with that

00:22:33.489 --> 00:22:33.499
get a more connected feeling with that
 

00:22:33.499 --> 00:22:36.430
get a more connected feeling with that
world that you're in and we've done that

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:36.440
world that you're in and we've done that
 

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:37.659
world that you're in and we've done that
in like every one of our games so far

00:22:37.659 --> 00:22:37.669
in like every one of our games so far
 

00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:41.440
in like every one of our games so far
has been character driven and it's and

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:41.450
has been character driven and it's and
 

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:44.980
has been character driven and it's and
it's hard to do I mean in terms of costs

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:44.990
it's hard to do I mean in terms of costs
 

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:46.989
it's hard to do I mean in terms of costs
and stuff like that I think a lot of a

00:22:46.989 --> 00:22:46.999
and stuff like that I think a lot of a
 

00:22:46.999 --> 00:22:48.940
and stuff like that I think a lot of a
lot of things or a lot of people might

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:48.950
lot of things or a lot of people might
 

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:51.419
lot of things or a lot of people might
shy away from some of that sometimes or

00:22:51.419 --> 00:22:51.429
shy away from some of that sometimes or
 

00:22:51.429 --> 00:22:54.039
shy away from some of that sometimes or
or just I don't know I mean ever

00:22:54.039 --> 00:22:54.049
or just I don't know I mean ever
 

00:22:54.049 --> 00:22:55.450
or just I don't know I mean ever
obviously there are million different

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:55.460
obviously there are million different
 

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:56.710
obviously there are million different
types of games and everybody should play

00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:56.720
types of games and everybody should play
 

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:58.239
types of games and everybody should play
all those different kinds but we like to

00:22:58.239 --> 00:22:58.249
all those different kinds but we like to
 

00:22:58.249 --> 00:23:00.430
all those different kinds but we like to
focus on those character moments and

00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:00.440
focus on those character moments and
 

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:01.989
focus on those character moments and
stuff and like we're only three people

00:23:01.989 --> 00:23:01.999
stuff and like we're only three people
 

00:23:01.999 --> 00:23:05.590
stuff and like we're only three people
you know but our first like it's me and

my business partner and our first and
only hire so far has been a full time

00:23:08.619 --> 00:23:08.629
only hire so far has been a full time
 

00:23:08.629 --> 00:23:11.529
only hire so far has been a full time
animator totally which I think a lot of

00:23:11.529 --> 00:23:11.539
animator totally which I think a lot of
 

00:23:11.539 --> 00:23:15.249
animator totally which I think a lot of
people are like why you know oh but you

00:23:15.249 --> 00:23:15.259
people are like why you know oh but you
 

00:23:15.259 --> 00:23:17.889
people are like why you know oh but you
know that's really tell you

00:23:17.889 --> 00:23:17.899
know that's really tell you
 

00:23:17.899 --> 00:23:19.779
know that's really tell you
characters are core to what we do as

00:23:19.779 --> 00:23:19.789
characters are core to what we do as
 

00:23:19.789 --> 00:23:22.210
characters are core to what we do as
storytellers and yeah the simple idea is

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:22.220
storytellers and yeah the simple idea is
 

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:23.560
storytellers and yeah the simple idea is
that if you don't care about the

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:23.570
that if you don't care about the
 

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:24.570
that if you don't care about the
characters

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:24.580
characters
 

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:25.620
characters
you don't really care about the story

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:25.630
you don't really care about the story
 

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:27.870
you don't really care about the story
right and if you're dry developing story

00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:27.880
right and if you're dry developing story
 

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:30.600
right and if you're dry developing story
driven games you know I think you

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:30.610
driven games you know I think you
 

00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:31.950
driven games you know I think you
fundamentally have to start in that same

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:31.960
fundamentally have to start in that same
 

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:33.450
fundamentally have to start in that same
place is that the characters are

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:33.460
place is that the characters are
 

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:35.789
place is that the characters are
critical to that development of that

00:23:35.789 --> 00:23:35.799
critical to that development of that
 

00:23:35.799 --> 00:23:38.789
critical to that development of that
story I think I found too or at least

00:23:38.789 --> 00:23:38.799
story I think I found too or at least
 

00:23:38.799 --> 00:23:40.049
story I think I found too or at least
this is the feeling that I get when I

00:23:40.049 --> 00:23:40.059
this is the feeling that I get when I
 

00:23:40.059 --> 00:23:41.639
this is the feeling that I get when I
play that character driven stuff is that

00:23:41.639 --> 00:23:41.649
play that character driven stuff is that
 

00:23:41.649 --> 00:23:45.299
play that character driven stuff is that
having other characters around like very

00:23:45.299 --> 00:23:45.309
having other characters around like very
 

00:23:45.309 --> 00:23:48.000
having other characters around like very
quickly helps ground me in that world

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:48.010
quickly helps ground me in that world
 

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:49.919
quickly helps ground me in that world
and make me feel like I'm a part of that

00:23:49.919 --> 00:23:49.929
and make me feel like I'm a part of that
 

00:23:49.929 --> 00:23:52.710
and make me feel like I'm a part of that
story as well and again you don't have

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:52.720
story as well and again you don't have
 

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.570
story as well and again you don't have
to be human you don't have to be doesn't

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:54.580
to be human you don't have to be doesn't
 

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:56.610
to be human you don't have to be doesn't
have to be photorealistic right not at

00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:56.620
have to be photorealistic right not at
 

00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:57.480
have to be photorealistic right not at
all

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:57.490
all
 

00:23:57.490 --> 00:23:59.879
all
and I think for us the way we like to

00:23:59.879 --> 00:23:59.889
and I think for us the way we like to
 

00:23:59.889 --> 00:24:01.560
and I think for us the way we like to
describe that that framework because

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:01.570
describe that that framework because
 

00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:03.659
describe that that framework because
when I was in video games I used to say

00:24:03.659 --> 00:24:03.669
when I was in video games I used to say
 

00:24:03.669 --> 00:24:05.669
when I was in video games I used to say
video games were just interactive

00:24:05.669 --> 00:24:05.679
video games were just interactive
 

00:24:05.679 --> 00:24:08.100
video games were just interactive
animation and animation was just a non

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:08.110
animation and animation was just a non
 

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:10.799
animation and animation was just a non
interactive video game and I've since

00:24:10.799 --> 00:24:10.809
interactive video game and I've since
 

00:24:10.809 --> 00:24:14.940
interactive video game and I've since
learned that not that smart more complex

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:14.950
learned that not that smart more complex
 

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:17.070
learned that not that smart more complex
than that the way we we talk about it a

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:17.080
than that the way we we talk about it a
 

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:20.039

because you know you have that

00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:23.740
because you know you have that
 

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:25.649
because you know you have that
interactive medium and the motivations

00:24:25.649 --> 00:24:25.659
interactive medium and the motivations
 

00:24:25.659 --> 00:24:28.529
interactive medium and the motivations
of real life and that kind of comes

00:24:28.529 --> 00:24:28.539
of real life and that kind of comes
 

00:24:28.539 --> 00:24:30.299
of real life and that kind of comes
together when you get it right in a

00:24:30.299 --> 00:24:30.309
together when you get it right in a
 

00:24:30.309 --> 00:24:33.539
together when you get it right in a
magical way yeah that's that's kind of

00:24:33.539 --> 00:24:33.549
magical way yeah that's that's kind of
 

00:24:33.549 --> 00:24:36.600

ways to get started things good good

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:45.970
ways to get started things good good
 

00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:49.500
ways to get started things good good
tools of the trade good tricks I think

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:49.510
tools of the trade good tricks I think
 

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:51.480
tools of the trade good tricks I think
from like the design side of it at least

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:51.490
from like the design side of it at least
 

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:56.700
from like the design side of it at least
like we had just like understanding the

00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:56.710
like we had just like understanding the
 

00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:58.860
like we had just like understanding the
capabilities of the controller is super

00:24:58.860 --> 00:24:58.870
capabilities of the controller is super
 

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:00.330
capabilities of the controller is super
important I think early on and

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:00.340
important I think early on and
 

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:01.919
important I think early on and
development of long together we were

00:25:01.919 --> 00:25:01.929
development of long together we were
 

00:25:01.929 --> 00:25:04.039
development of long together we were
trying to do a lot of stuff with the

00:25:04.039 --> 00:25:04.049
trying to do a lot of stuff with the
 

00:25:04.049 --> 00:25:06.690
trying to do a lot of stuff with the
gyroscopes and the accelerometer and had

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:06.700
gyroscopes and the accelerometer and had
 

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:08.100
gyroscopes and the accelerometer and had
just all these features that were trying

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:08.110
just all these features that were trying
 

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:10.110
just all these features that were trying
to do a bunch of stuff with and I'm not

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:10.120
to do a bunch of stuff with and I'm not
 

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:11.370
to do a bunch of stuff with and I'm not
saying this is always the case but for

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:11.380
saying this is always the case but for
 

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:13.860
saying this is always the case but for
us like really scaling back and saying

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:13.870
us like really scaling back and saying
 

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:16.500
us like really scaling back and saying
okay like what is the simplest way for

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:16.510
okay like what is the simplest way for
 

00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:17.789
okay like what is the simplest way for
people to interact with this controller

00:25:17.789 --> 00:25:17.799
people to interact with this controller
 

00:25:17.799 --> 00:25:20.220
people to interact with this controller
and interact with the world kind of like

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:20.230
and interact with the world kind of like
 

00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:22.830
and interact with the world kind of like
you were saying like earlier really

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:22.840
you were saying like earlier really
 

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:26.129
you were saying like earlier really
figuring out the simple interactions

00:25:26.129 --> 00:25:26.139
figuring out the simple interactions
 

00:25:26.139 --> 00:25:27.870
figuring out the simple interactions
that have a big impact and that we felt

00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:27.880
that have a big impact and that we felt
 

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.730
that have a big impact and that we felt
like doing too much with the controller

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:29.740
like doing too much with the controller
 

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:31.200
like doing too much with the controller
in general even though there are all

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:31.210
in general even though there are all
 

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:33.000
in general even though there are all
these things you can do with it really

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:33.010
these things you can do with it really
 

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:35.549
these things you can do with it really
increased like the the learning curve

00:25:35.549 --> 00:25:35.559
increased like the the learning curve
 

00:25:35.559 --> 00:25:38.760
increased like the the learning curve
quite a lot so I think really

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:38.770
quite a lot so I think really
 

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:41.100
quite a lot so I think really
getting your controls like streamlined

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:41.110
getting your controls like streamlined
 

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:43.440
getting your controls like streamlined
if you're doing a game or even just

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:43.450
if you're doing a game or even just
 

00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:45.570
if you're doing a game or even just
anything with interaction I think that's

00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:45.580
anything with interaction I think that's
 

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:49.080
anything with interaction I think that's
like a big place to start for daydream

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:49.090
like a big place to start for daydream
 

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:52.440
like a big place to start for daydream
awesome I'd say I mean obviously unity

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:52.450
awesome I'd say I mean obviously unity
 

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:54.150

into mobile devices obviously should be

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:56.710
into mobile devices obviously should be
 

00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:59.880
into mobile devices obviously should be
working in a game engine I do think that

00:25:59.880 --> 00:25:59.890
working in a game engine I do think that
 

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:02.100
working in a game engine I do think that
your point around controllers is really

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:02.110
