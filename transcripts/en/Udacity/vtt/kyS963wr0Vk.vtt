00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's try our hand at crafting another regular expression.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It's a creative activity. It's fun stuff.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And this one is designed to be a bit tricky.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I'm going to ask you to write a regular expression that matches

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
single-argument mathematical functions.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Let me be more specific about that.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
First, the function name is a lowercase word made up of 1 or more lowercase letters, [a - z].

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The function argument should be a number made up of 1 or more digits, [0 - 9].

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And there may, optionally, be spaces before and/or after the argument.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So here you've got a function name that's lowercase letters--cosign--c-o-s.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It has parenthesis, and then it has a single argument that's a number.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Here we've got the same thing, but I've got these spaces before and after the argument.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
These 2 are not matched.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
This one has a space between the function name and the parenthesis.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
For this particular exercise, that's not allowed.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We're only allowing spaces just before and just after the number.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
This one is square root of x, but we're looking for functions that have numeric arguments,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
not word arguments.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Submit via the interpreter, a regular expression matching this specification.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
As a hint, you may find that you have to escape the opening and closing parenthesis

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.062
to make sure that they're treated correctly.
