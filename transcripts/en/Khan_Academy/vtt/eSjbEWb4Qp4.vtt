00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.360
Construct a circle
circumscribing the triangle.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.180
So that would be a circle that
touches the vertices, the three

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.320
vertices of this triangle.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.020
So we can construct it using
a compass and a straight edge,

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.640
or a virtual compass and
a virtual straight edge.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.480
So what we want to do is center
the circle at the perpendicular

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.230
bisectors of the sides,
or sometimes that's

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.710
called the circumcenter
of this triangle.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.790
So let's do that.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.660
And so let's think
about-- let's try

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.500
to construct where
the perpendicular

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.410
bisectors of the sides are.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.370
So let me put a
circle right over here

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.400
whose radius is longer than
this side right over here.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.980
Now let me get one
that has the same size.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.730
So let me make it the same
size as the one I just did.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.320
And let me put it
right over here.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.140
And this allows us to construct
a perpendicular bisector.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:03.350
If I go through that point and
this point right over here,

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.100
this bisects this
side over here,

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.810
and it's at a right angle.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.000
So now let's do that
for the other sides.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.170
So if I move this over
here-- and I really just

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.130
have to do it for one
of the other sides,

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.520
because the intersection
of two lines

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.780
is going to give me a point.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.260
So I can do it for this
side right over here.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.690
Let me scroll down so you
can see a little bit clearer.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.740
So let me add another
straight edge right over here.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.740
So I'm going to go
through that point,

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.340
and I'm going to go
through this point.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.310
So that's the
perpendicular bisector

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.540
of this side right over here.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.829
And I could do the
third side and it

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:43.120
should intersect at that point.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.245
I'm not ultra, ultra precise,
but I'm close enough.

00:01:46.245 --> 00:01:48.370
And now I just have to
center one of these circles.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.310
Let me move one of these away.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.630
So let me just get
rid of this one.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.020
And I just have to move this
circle to the circumcenter

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.710
and adjust its radius so that
it gets pretty close to touching

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.961
the three sides, the three
vertices of this triangle.

00:02:05.961 --> 00:02:07.210
It doesn't have to be perfect.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.479
I think this exercise has
some margin for error.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.130
But they really want
to see that you've

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.790
made an attempt at
drawing the perpendicular

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.180
bisectors of the sides,
to find the circumcenter,

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.180
and then you put a
circle right over there.
