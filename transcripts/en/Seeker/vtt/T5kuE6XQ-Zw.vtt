00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.140
IAN
Aliens are out there, dude!

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.140
TRACE
I know they are!

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:03.520
I did the math.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.629
IAN
Ahem.

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:07.740
TRACE
Maths.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.790
Ugh.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.050
TRACE
Hey hoomons, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.330
Finding extra-terrestrial beings is not entirely
science fiction, it's more like science…

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.340
uh.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.550
Science Wait-and-see-but-it's-totally-going-to-happen.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:22.699
It's a mathematical inevitability.

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.630
IAN
It's true, but there are still some problems.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.439
In 1959, the journal Nature published a paper
that found satellite dishes, which are basically

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.910
electromagnetic wave antennas, had become
sensitive enough that if pointed in the right

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.969
place, they MIGHT pick up alien communications.

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:39.750
TRACE
A year later, a Cornell astronomer named Frank

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.379
Drake did so… kicking off the now-famous,
Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence,

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.379
or SETI.

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:47.660
And then a year after that, he created the
Drake Equation.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.000
IAN
The Drake Equation basically breaks down the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.899
Milky Way into numbers to arrive at an estimate
of how many communicating alien civilizations

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.449
might be out there.

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:58.430
The Drake Equation considers the following
factors:

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.039
TRACE &amp; IAN (alternate)
The average rate of star formation

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.110
The fraction of those stars with planets
The average number of potentially habitable

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.590
planets around those stars
The fraction of those planets which can support

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.270
life
The fraction that actually DO develop life

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.490
The fraction of those with life that evolved
to be intelligent and civilized

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.390
The fraction of civilized intelligent life
that have developed communications

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.090
And finally, the length of time it takes those
intelligent aliens to transmit a signal into

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.090
space.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.560
TRACE
And this was all designed to put an estimate

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.370
on the number of developed, intelligent, communicative,
civilizations which are out there waiting

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.619
for us to find…

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.020
IAN
But obviously, there are some problems with

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.020
this formula.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.159
It’s basically taking a bunch of unknowns
and throwing them into an equation that can

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.460
give a huge range of probabilities.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.120
But even Drake didn’t intend for this equation
to be a definitive answer as to whether or

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.970
not aliens with radio dishes are REALLY out
there.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.270
It's supposed to help us start the conversation
about the sheer NUMBER of planets which could

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.270
have life.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.200
TRACE
Interestingly as time goes on and advances

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.299
in astronomy come in thick and fast, we’re
gradually refining our estimates on how many

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.590
exoplanets are out there in the galaxy…

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.000
IAN
And there’s a LOT.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.210
NASA’s Kepler space telescope is even finding
worlds orbiting within their star’s “habitable

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.480
zones” that are possibly cosy places for
life to evolve.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.760
The upshot is that the more real data that
we can throw into this equation, the more

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.880
compelling it becomes.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.640
But there are other factors that the Drake
Equation doesn’t consider, one of them being:

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.120
how do non-living chemicals turn into living,
breathing, creatures that eventually evolve

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.400
to build radio transmitters?

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.780
TRACE
Now, there’s another equation which uses

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.660
planetary chemistry to calculate the odds
that life could form on a planet at all!

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.011
IAN
It's almost like this new Scharf-Cronin equation

00:02:37.011 --> 00:02:39.450
is one of the missing puzzle pieces from the
Drake equation!

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.670
TRACE
The Scharf-Cronin uses the total number of

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.260
building blocks on given planet, and multiplies
it by the fraction of building blocks needed

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.940
per "organism", multiplies that by the availability
of those building blocks during the time they

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.400
exist, and then the probability of the assembly
of those blocks in a given time, and then

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.310
multiplies that by time overall.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.209
IAN
From that, it can determine a rough estimate

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.430
of the odds that an origin-of-life event would
happen on a planet!

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.130
Turning non-living chemicals into a functioning
biology is called “abiogenesis” and this

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.540
new equation provides us with new microscopic
areas to study, beyond the Drake Equation,

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.989
if we are to identify where life could possibly
gain a foothold.

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.860
TRACE
Equations like these are starting points for

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.519
scientists to figure out what we need to know
to find answers like, "are we alone?"

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.860
Without the Drake and now the Scharf-Cronin
equations we wouldn't have a model to start

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.269
with, in finding out how many planets might
have life out there.

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.909
IAN
THIS is the bleeding-edge of science in some

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:33.909
ways.

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:36.810
Just a bunch of people... sitting around,
thinking about how we can figure out the answer

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.110
to The Big Questions.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.900
TRACE
So, how do we know life exists?

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.220
Because mathematically speaking it probably
does, maybe not Drake-level communicative

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.709
life, perhaps it's microroganisms, or maybe
plants!

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.769
But, in the end, the 1959 paper by Cocconi
and Morrison put it best in it's very last

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:56.019
line, "The probability of success is difficult
to estimate, but if we never search, the chance

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:57.680
of success is zero."

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.180
IAN
One way life could have found its way to our

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.480
planet, might have been via PANSPERMIA.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.599
TRACE
My, gosh Ian!

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:04.850
Whatever could that be?!

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:13.950
IAN
You can watch this video and find out!

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:26.540
TRACE
Do you think life exists out there?
