00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.100
DANIEL GALPIN: Hello.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.680
I don't mean to disappoint
anyone in the audience here.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.260
But for anyone who came to see
Practical Android Game

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.490
Development, that is actually
not going to be the title of

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:16.440
this session.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.580
We wanted to have a place
holder, so that people who

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.720
were coming to Google I/O and
who were game developers could

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.170
have a way of planning
their schedule out

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.250
before they got here.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.150
So we are actually going to be
doing something related to a

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.640
little announcement we did
during the keynote.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.690
And so once again, this
is going to be

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.000
Game Services in Practice.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.070
I'm Dan Galpin, a Developer
Advocate for Android Games.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.430
JENNIE LEES: Jennie Lees, I'm a
Product Manager on the Games

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.070
Platform team.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.480
JAEWOONG JUNG: I'm Jaewoong
Jung, the Tech Lead of the

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.305
Game Developer Experience
team.

00:00:49.305 --> 00:00:54.080
DANIEL GALPIN: So that being
said, this is our second talk

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.050
on the Game Services platform.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.050
And so what this means is, if
you haven't listened to the

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.670
keynote, don't understand what
Games Services are, don't

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.770
program, you might want to leave
the room, because this

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.180
might not make any sense.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.770
All right.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:18.600
Every game begins with an
idea, an original idea.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.590
And perhaps, it's that one in a
million idea that carves out

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.120
a niche on Google Play.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.580
So the question is, how do we
squeeze as much money out of

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.450
it as we possibly can.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.935
For that, we need a PM.

00:01:31.935 --> 00:01:32.905
Jenny--

00:01:32.905 --> 00:01:36.070
JENNIE LEES: So money--

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.240
I've heard that seasonal content
is really the thing on

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.150
Google Play these days.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.980
I think I want "Angry Pumpkins."
I want "Angry Fruit

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:44.560
Fall."

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.520
JAEWOONG JUNG: Wait guys, I'm
so tired of hearing about

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.920
casual games.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.060
How about making a
hardcore edition?

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.230
DANIEL GALPIN: Oh, no, no.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.360
My favorite version is the
shameless movie tie-in.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.740
But I digress.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.160
The real question is, how do
we use Google Play Games

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.590
Services best, in every facet of
the life cycle of the game?

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.000
From when you're developing,
testing, publishing, or

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.930
updating, and managing your
gaming community, we're going

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.700
to talk about all of these
things in the talk.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.760
So let's start with
development.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.480
And just for a show of hands--
in the audience, how many

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.992
people here are actually
developers?

00:02:26.992 --> 00:02:27.944
All right.

00:02:27.944 --> 00:02:29.200
We've got the right
people here.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.610
That's awesome.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.040
Despite all that stuff I said
earlier, let's quickly review

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.720
how we set up a game in the
Google Play developer console.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.390
So one path is, you
upload an APK.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.840
And this one is going
to be signed with

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.550
your production signature.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.050
So it's pretty much like you
do anything else in your

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.880
publishing in Google Play.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.500
And after that is complete, we
notice we have this really

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.580
cool new tab here that
looks like a game

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.070
controller, sort of.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.370
As you can see, I've already
been experimenting with one of

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.860
the samples, before I dove into
creating my own project,

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:00.910
which everyone should do.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.430
Because experimenting is good,
and you'll find out what you

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.270
don't know.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.260
But we're going to
add a new game.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.180
Then, we get to set up the
services for our app, which

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.160
doesn't use Google's APIs
yet, which makes sense.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.160
A lot of people aren't yet.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.340
But they should.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.770
And then we add the "Angry
Fruit" Package Name.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.360
So going on from there, we end
up getting this fabulous

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.960
dialogue telling us about
branding information, which

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.580
I'm not going to cover.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.920
But other people will cover
these things in another talk.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:40.070
And then finally, after all
of this, there we are.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.320
We now get to the fun part.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.760
So what we've done now is, we've
actually extracted from

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.940
that APK file the SHA1
Certificate Fingerprint that

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.830
you're going to be using
for that client.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:59.080
And this actually is creating
a client on Google's Apiary

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.070
dashboard, which is the way
these things are all designed.

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.700
The code.google.com dashboard,
that's an internal name.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.410
And note that we end up getting
this lovely the screen

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.030
here, which contains this very
large client ID and this 12

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.300
digit number, which is
the application ID.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:21.050
And this is what we actually
put into the package, so

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.030
again, not that whole thing.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.100
So finally, we end up getting
into some code.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.420
And very simply, this is
our manifest file.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.990
And that is the little section
there that contains the App ID

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.260
that we're sending to
these services.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.160
Now, notice that we
actually have two

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.340
separate services here.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.680
One of them is for App State.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.130
And the other one
is for Games.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.070
And the reason why is, App State
obviously has a lot of

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.710
applications beyond games.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.030
And that is the App ID that
we're going to place in.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.690
Now, notice that it
is a resource.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.760
And the reason we're doing that
is, because otherwise,

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.430
the Android Resource System
will actually

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.070
interpret it as a number.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.760
We want it to be a string.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.140
So don't just put it in
the manifest file.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.980
And then, here we are.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:07.780
There's our App ID.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.120
And we put it inside
of our resources.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.230
So very simply, now we set up
our program for launch.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.550
Except there's one problem here,
because we have a game

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.930
that'll work with the Play
Services API, signed with our

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.020
release keys, which
is what we're

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.280
going to actually publish.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.650
However, no one actually
develops an Android game,

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:27.870
using the release keys.

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.760
Or if you are, you really
shouldn't, because you should

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:30.850
protect that key store.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.260
That is your identity,
your digital

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.810
identity on Google Play.

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.660
So how do we make it work
with the Debug Key?

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.260
Well, that's very simply we
go and link another app.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.670
And the other app has the same
package name as our regular

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.040
application.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.630
And we end up getting a blank
value for the SHA1 Because we

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.310
didn't actually upload
that APK.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.400
So where do we get
this value from?

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.550
Well, it depends on
what platform

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.290
you're actually running.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:02.180
We create this automatically for
you on Linux, Windows, or

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.170
Vista Plus, or whatever.

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:08.010
The important thing is that, you
should probably take and

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.180
actually go through the step
of sharing the same Debug

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.960
Keystore across your developers,
because we only

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.400
allow you to create a limited
number of client

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.220
IDs for your game.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.360
So it's a good practice
to be, in any case.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.530
And then, after all of this,
we actually get the SHA

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.520
fingerprint by using Keytool.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.510
So now we can take that
fingerprint, dump it back into

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:31.560
this new client.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.250
And now we are ready.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.760
And all of our developers will
actually be able to develop

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.500
against Play Services.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.740
Now we're in a good place.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:45.880
But what about actually
integrating the Games APIs?

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.886
Jenny, what's the deal
with branding?

00:06:47.886 --> 00:06:50.450
JENNIE LEES: So we've come up
with some guidelines to help

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:52.760
you integrate the Games Services
and make a really

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.470
consistent experience
for your players.

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:57.740
First of all, two very
important notes--

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.070
to be a Games Services
customer, you

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:01.670
need to do two things.

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:03.630
First of all, you need
to use Sign-In.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:05.870
And then, because signing in
without any features is

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.280
useless, you also need
to have achievements.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.280
So let's start by looking
at Sign-In.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.910
Because we use Google+ for our
sign in and our identity, so

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:16.950
should you, for the branding.

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:20.020
We have a very small, red
g+ logo you can use.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.420
Or if you want something bigger,
there's a full version

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.110
with Sign-In.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:27.200
In a game context though, if you
just stick that red button

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.600
somewhere, with no explanation,
no context, it's

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.910
kind of confusing.

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:33.960
Why would I ever tap that,
if I'm a player?

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:39.090
So we want you to really give an
upsell, explain what you're

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:41.800
using it for, what you're
going to do with it, why

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.255
should the player bother?

00:07:43.255 --> 00:07:45.180
There are all these great
features that are waiting to

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:46.740
be unlocked when they sign in.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.850
So let them understand that.

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:50.740
And this is from "Save the
Puppies." They did a great job

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.880
in just making it
really clear.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.360
You want to collect
achievements.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:55.890
You want to compete
with your friends.

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:58.150
Come right in.

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:01.617
For the end game features
themselves, we have icons to

00:08:01.617 --> 00:08:05.660
fit each of them, that you can
use and customize, in texture

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:06.990
and your game's look and feel.

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:09.780
You don't have to use them
as these flat vectors.

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:12.090
And we do provide our own
interface for leaderboards and

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:13.090
achievements.

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:16.500
Now, we ask that you put in a
way to get to that interface.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.320
And we really thoroughly
encourage you to mess about

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:23.300
with our data APIs and customize
skin, use the data

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.100
in your own games UI,
as much as you like.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:29.010
If you want to put a little
button to bring up our UI, you

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:31.450
should use our branding to make
it really clear to the

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:34.190
player what's going to happen
and make it a really

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:36.549
consistent experience.

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:38.970
The controller is the main
symbol for this.

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:40.850
And as you'll see in the games
that are live on the Play

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:44.100
Store today, the controller is
used a lot to say, this is

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.430
where the games services are.

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:47.370
This is where the cool
stuff lives.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:50.140
And if you have a page, like a
menu, which has achievements

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.790
and leaderboards and maybe even
multiplayer, you don't

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:53.990
want to put like three
controllers.

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:55.840
That means absolutely nothing.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.330
So you can use the controller
as like a contextual key and

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.115
the individual feature
icons for the links.

00:09:02.115 --> 00:09:04.690
Let's look at that
in practice.

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:09.270
So you can see, as with the
HandyGames screen shot we have

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:12.140
on the bottom there, they've
used the controller as like

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:12.900
tying things in.

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.900
And they've used individual
icons, with completely their

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.420
own look and feel there,
to launch our UIs.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:19.190
You have to be boring.

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:23.490
Just keep one really simple
principle in mind.

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:25.550
We don't want people
to be confused,

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:29.060
surprised, upset, or angry.

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:30.400
Angry?

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:34.160
I would be angry, if I played
a game for hours.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.110
And right at the end of all
that play, I'm told, hey,

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:37.820
maybe you could sign
in, through some

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.450
obscure menu somewhere.

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:41.570
And none of that progress
gets synced.

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:44.240
None of that counted, because
I wasn't signed in.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:50.040
So keep people nice and give
them a reason to use the

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:57.147
services and not get angry at
you, because that's bad.

00:09:57.147 --> 00:10:00.970
DANIEL GALPIN: And of course,
you can find all of these

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:03.270
branding guidelines and assets
in our Developer

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:04.520
documentation.

00:10:06.325 --> 00:10:09.780
JENNIE LEES: So let's go back
to our friend, the wrathful

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:10.440
watermelon.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.250
DANIEL GALPIN: Wrathful
ninja watermelon.

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:13.610
JENNIE LEES: Oh, yeah.

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:15.190
So we're ready to go.

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:15.600
Aren't we, Dan?

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.640
We've got our game.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:18.610
It's glorious.

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:19.115
It's original.

00:10:19.115 --> 00:10:20.560
It's creative.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.255
It's ready for beta testing.

00:10:22.255 --> 00:10:25.640
JAEWOONG JUNG: Wait, we have
a lot of fans in Korea.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.460
Over half of our testers
are international.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:32.916
I want to test [KOREAN], as
well as "Angry Fruit."

00:10:32.916 --> 00:10:34.280
JENNIE LEES: That is
a great point.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.980
So let's talk about
Localization.

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:41.088
Oh wait, there's an error
on that slide, Dan.

00:10:41.088 --> 00:10:43.410
That's better.

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:44.560
Thank you.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.990
So I wanted to walk you guys
through some of our really

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:49.550
neat Localization support.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:53.100
To localize your game's
integration is pretty simple.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:55.640
You add languages in the
console, provide translations.

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.540
And we do all the hard
work for you.

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.450
We pipe it all through to all
of the relevant places.

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:02.375
If you go to the root of your
game configuration and hit Add

00:11:02.375 --> 00:11:04.290
Translations, you can select
your languages.

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:05.710
And off you go.

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:08.120
Now remember, once you've added
a language here, you're

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.140
committing to providing
translations for all the

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.130
strings that you send
us, all the

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:13.680
achievement names, et cetera.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.500
And we don't want you to tick
all the boxes, so that it

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.460
looks like you're really
Localized, but

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.000
not actually do it.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.240
You can also change the
default locale here.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.760
So if you don't want
English to be the

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.711
default, you can do that.

00:11:24.711 --> 00:11:27.590
For leaderboards and
achievements, translation are

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:30.550
super, super simple.

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:32.350
When your game is in Draft Mode,
you just type in the new

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:34.010
title and go.

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:36.150
If you don't do it, you can
get a nice, big error.

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:38.640
It's says pretty clear what's
going on there.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.100
I also want to talk about
leaderboard formatting.

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.890
We have this really nifty stuff
here that's really nice

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:44.160
for localization.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.220
And it has other applications
too.

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:48.280
First of all, you can have
currency leaderboards.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.020
And you can set that to a
number of international

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:51.350
currencies.

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:52.860
So we use the symbol for
that currency when

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.080
we display the score.

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:58.450
You might think though, that for
international currencies,

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:01.970
you can just put the local
currency in for each locale,

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:04.510
and it will format the
score locally.

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:07.290
However, that is not the case.

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:11.240
So if you set your score to Yen
here, if I go back to US

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.200
English, it will be Yen.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.670
And you might not want that.

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:17.250
So this is a really good use
case for our custom score

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:19.480
formatting, not the only
one, by a long way.

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:22.400
But it's one I wanted
to highlight here.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.570
If I wanted to use dollars in
America and Yen in Japan, I

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:28.135
configure an integer and
add a custom unit.

00:12:28.135 --> 00:12:30.650
Once I've done that, I've
committed to translating the

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:33.300
plurals for that language,
for that unit.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.430
American English, it's easy.

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:39.170
Japanese, I've decided just to
use the symbol, because I want

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:41.550
to make sure I get it right.

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:43.350
So I'm just going to do that.

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:45.960
And as you'll notice,
the plural options

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.230
are different there.

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:48.580
We're pretty comprehensive
about that.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.560
So if you go to a language such
as Polish, you'll see we

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.420
ask you to pluralize all
the different plural

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:54.700
cases in that language.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.310
So if you're putting in
translation requests to

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:59.270
external team, you might want
to bear that in mind.

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:00.970
You can also use this as
a guideline when you're

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:02.480
designing your leaderboards
in the first place.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.930
It might spark off
a few ideas.

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:06.480
You can be pretty creative
as well.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.180
But there's a couple
of constraints.

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:09.670
It's always a suffix.

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:10.870
And in right to left languages,

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:12.730
it would be a prefix.

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:14.690
So what do you need?

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:16.070
When you've added a language,
you're saying, I'm going to

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:17.510
translate all this stuff.

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:19.850
We make it pretty easy in that,
if you're testing, the

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:21.570
descriptions can be optional.

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:23.850
And the leaderboard units, as
you saw, you can change it

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:25.230
around between different
languages.

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:27.880
So you can have a custom one, in
English, and just plain old

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.540
integer for the rest of them.

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:33.374
If we don't have the unit, then
we'll just leave it off.

00:13:33.374 --> 00:13:35.920
A couple of nuances as well--

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.820
so you know, in the Play Store,
they have Localized

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:38.520
Image Assets.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.250
We do not have that yet.

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:43.130
So make sure that your images
that you use for Achievement

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:45.580
icons, leaderboard icons,
and so on are language

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:46.300
independent.

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.866
Otherwise, it looks
kind of weird.

00:13:47.866 --> 00:13:51.870
You also want to make sure
that, although you have a

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:54.060
store entry and you have
configured translations for

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:58.650
what appears in the Play Store
app, on other countries.

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:00.530
This is unrelated to
what appears in the

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:02.630
Game Services in Game.

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:04.600
So if you've set all those
translations, you may have to

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.380
just click them across.

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:08.990
And also, if you're end game
locales are from the ones you

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:11.890
have configured, there will be
a slight mismatch there.

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:14.210
So there could be cases where
your game supports different

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:16.770
languages to the ones you've put
in the Play Store config.

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:17.955
Some people do that.

00:14:17.955 --> 00:14:19.930
We also do some pretty
cool fall-backs.

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:22.443
So if you have a Canadian-French
player, but

00:14:22.443 --> 00:14:25.160
you've only got French-French
translations, we'll do that.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:29.280
We won't make them go English,
which is really nice.

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:29.890
All right.

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:32.100
So I think we're
ready to test.

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:32.495
We're good.

00:14:32.495 --> 00:14:34.916
How do we get some
beta testers?

00:14:34.916 --> 00:14:35.810
DANIEL GALPIN: All right.

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:40.150
So again, to make things clear,
Game Services in the

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.890
console are actually separate
from the regular Google Play

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:43.760
Developer console.

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.060
And part of the reason why is,
obviously, Game Services

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:47.840
covers multiple platforms.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.310
And so when you're actually
talking about beta testers,

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:52.540
you're actually talking about
beta testers that could be for

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:53.190
any of these platforms.

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:56.580
We have a separate place
in the services to

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:58.600
actually set that up.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.640
And it's very simple.

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.750
You just literally go
to Play Services.

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:03.020
And you click Add Testers.

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:04.090
And this is important.

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:06.130
Because of course,
only testers can

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:06.980
test unpublished games.

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:08.910
And you kind of knew that one.

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:10.150
We're kind of smart for you.

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:13.680
We also make sure that only
testers can receive

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.310
multiplayer invites.

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:18.040
And so you won't accidentally
leak a really cool multiplayer

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.090
game that you're working
on, just because

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:22.830
you are testing it.

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:25.160
Another thing, of course,
that's really useful for

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.300
developers and was asked very
early on is, please give me

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:29.840
the ability to retest
Achievements.

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.170
So at you can retest them
over and over again.

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:36.230
And finally, you might want to
reset scores on leaderboards.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:37.590
And if you're doing multiplayer,
you might

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:38.940
actually want to eliminate
all your

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:41.340
multiplayer invites or rooms.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:44.770
So how do your testers
do this?

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:47.360
Do you need to give each one of
your testers access to the

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:50.570
Google Developer console?

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:51.020
No.

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:53.280
Actually, the good news is that,
you can build a website.

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:54.880
So your testers can reset
their own achievements,

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.220
leaderboards, and multiplayer
rooms.

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.450
And Jaewoong will show
us how to do it.

00:15:58.450 --> 00:15:59.000
JAEWOONG JUNG: Wow.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.290
It's finally my turn.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:06.120
OK., how do you build a website
like this, where

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:09.440
testers can reset
their game data?

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.450
We must start with
registering our

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:13.510
website on the Play console.

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:16.880
Go to the Linked Apps tab,
click on that button, and

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:23.120
choose Web, and enter basic
information, like the Launch

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:26.780
URL, Save, and Continue.

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:29.220
And click Authorize Your
App Now button.

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:31.440
Otherwise, Google cannot
verify API

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.710
calls from your site.

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:35.740
Enter basic branding
information.

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:38.900
This is only required
once for a project.

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:40.780
And enter the Host Name.

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:45.120
Only API calls from this host
will be authorized.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:48.770
And finally, you're
given a Client ID.

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:52.710
But unlike Android Apps, you
need the whole Client ID

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:56.840
string to get all the tokens
from your website.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:00.350
So it's time to see how you
actually build your test

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:02.960
website with the Client ID.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:05.560
Users must be signed into
Google to use the Games

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:06.780
Services API.

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:09.920
So let's add our Google+
Sign-In button

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.940
to our website first.

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:15.700
This is the standard Google+
Sign-In code, with a modified

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.700
scope for the Games Services.

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:23.800
And you want to specify the
Client ID here, like this.

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.670
Also, handle the Sign-In
result with a callback

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:27.659
function like this.

00:17:27.659 --> 00:17:29.420
And this is a very
simple version.

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:32.660
It hides the Sign-In button
when it is successful.

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:36.730
And it loads the error when
there are some problems.

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:40.170
Now, the user is authorized
then, ready to call Games

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:41.800
Services APIs.

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.460
As an example, I'm going to
show you how to reset an

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:47.130
achievement, while other restart
methods [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:48.970
the same.

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:51.960
Once the Sign-In is done, you're
given this special

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:56.670
object called G-A-P-I, or gapi,
which is provided by

00:17:56.670 --> 00:18:00.230
Google API JavaScript Library.

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:01.560
I remembered it.

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.510
It provides many functions.

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:06.680
But especially, this
client.request function is

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:10.330
very handy, when you make
general API calls.

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:13.470
You specify an API path.

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:16.230
In this case, we're specifying
a path to set an achievement

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:18.290
with an Achievement ID.

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:22.140
And specify a Calling Method,
like Post, Put, Get, or

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:25.110
Delete, and a callback
function.

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:26.070
And it's done.

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:27.850
How simple is that?

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:31.900
So now the Achievement will be
reset on the tester's device.

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:33.235
Dan, is that right?

00:18:33.235 --> 00:18:35.600
DANIEL GALPIN: Not exactly.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:38.640
So right now, we've told the
server, great reset the

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.130
Achievement.

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:41.680
So the Achievement has now
been reset on the server.

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.380
But it actually hasn't synced
to the device yet.

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:46.420
And it doesn't sync immediately
there, unless you

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:48.810
go and display our UI.

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:50.980
So if you're not displaying our
UI, you're going to want

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:53.450
to have the ability for your
testers to bring up the UI

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:54.730
within your application.

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:57.306
JENNIE LEES: What if I don't
want to build a website, Dan?

00:18:57.306 --> 00:18:58.530
DANIEL GALPIN: All
right, all right.

00:18:58.530 --> 00:18:59.740
That's a good point.

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:01.940
So how many people here
don't want to build

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:04.300
a website for this?

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:06.120
So the good news is that you can
actually reset them on the

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.640
device too.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.080
It's a little tricky, because
you actually have to go

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:10.690
through the same flow.

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:13.100
The good news is that we
actually offer you

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.650
some APIs that help.

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:17.030
First of all, you're going to
need up to two additional

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:17.870
permissions.

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:20.950
The great thing about using Play
Game Services is that you

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:23.400
don't actually need to have
internet permission or

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.300
accounts permission.

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.620
We handle all that in the
background for you.

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:28.160
But if you're going
to want to reset

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.520
Achievements for your testers.

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.610
In a debug version of your
application, you're going to

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:35.910
need these two additional
permissions, potentially.

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:39.270
And after Sign-In is complete,
then you can get the current

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:40.740
account name.

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:44.680
Now, what's great about this,
is that you notice these two

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.660
things in the bottom are
just very simple calls.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:48.970
And that's because they're
taking advantage of something

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:51.830
called Base Game Activity, which
is a wrapper for our

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:54.200
client library that handles a
lot of the boiler-plate code

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.430
for handling errors
right for you.

00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:58.480
And it's part of Game Helper.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.820
And you can actually download
this off of

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:01.540
the Developer site.

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:03.770
And it gives you a lot of
insight into handling all of

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:06.960
these cases in Google Play
Games Services--

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.370
very, very cool.

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:12.040
So then we just have to
get the Off Token.

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:13.960
So now, the one thing that's
interesting about getting the

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.670
Off Token is, we want to make
sure that the Scope that we're

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:19.280
using, that we're trying to
fetch, matches the scope we're

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.440
signing in with.

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:23.930
So for example, if you wanted
to use both the Cloud Save

00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:28.970
APIs for App State and the Games
APIs, those are actually

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:30.190
two separate Scopes.

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:31.850
So you're going to want to
make sure they match.

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:34.730
Otherwise, the system will go
and prompt you and say, you

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:37.140
don't have a credential that
matches these Scopes.

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:38.930
So we need to fetch that.

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:40.340
So it's very, very
easy to do that.

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.440
If you're using
BaseGameActivity/gamehelper,

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.710
you can just call getScopes.

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:46.130
And it'll nicely return
that for you.

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:49.750
If you're not, that's how
you construct them.

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.750
Then, we just fetch the token
from GoogleAuthUtil.

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:55.620
Now, you note here, we're not
handling important exceptions

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:57.970
like
UserRecoverableAuthException.

00:20:57.970 --> 00:20:59.495
After all, these are
just your testers.

00:20:59.495 --> 00:21:01.650
They'll see the log messages.

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:03.200
Right?

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.890
In all how seriousness, no,
there is a little bit more

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:06.720
work to be done here.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.450
And there are some things
that can go wrong.

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:09.550
First of all, as I
said before, your

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:11.430
Scope must match exactly.

00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:14.440
Otherwise, you'll get a
UserRecoverableAuthException.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:17.190
And of course, your token
may have expired.

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:18.910
So there's nothing-- when you
actually call getToken,

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:20.780
there's nothing that's part
of that call that goes and

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.240
automatically refreshes
the token.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:23.900
It's a pretty low-level API.

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.730
But once you've done all this
work, you can pretty much do

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:30.090
the exact same thing we
did on the server.

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:34.860
Make a little HTTP client, call
that Rest API, and boom,

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.090
we've now reset the
achievement.

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:38.440
Now even though we've done
this on the device.

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:43.430
We still have to go and call
the Games Services UI for

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:45.820
displaying Achievements, in
order to force the client to

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:47.970
pull those down.

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:50.420
It's also just as easy to call
the Management API, if you

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:51.860
want to reset the scores.

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:52.980
As long as you have
that token, the

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:55.690
world is your oyster.

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:57.310
And again, you'll want to
invalidate the cache.

00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:59.990
You can also do it by calling
one of our APIs here and

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:02.780
simply saying, forceReload
on all of these things--

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:05.520
so very, very easy to make sure
that you continue to test

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:09.730
leaderboards and Achievements,
again and again and again.

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:11.850
So now, we're ready
to publish.

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:15.606
It's time for the PM to
take all the credit.

00:22:15.606 --> 00:22:18.310
JENNIE LEES: This is
my favorite part,

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.700
pushing stuff live--

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:19.630
DANIEL GALPIN: Taking
the credit.

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:21.610
JENNIE LEES: --breaking out of
there, fixing all the bugs,

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:24.530
making people do it for me.

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:27.460
So lets get our game
out there.

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:30.720
But a few things just to bear
in mind, before you go live,

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.470
before you hit the big
switch, so to speak.

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:36.180
First of all, assets, we've
seen this in testing, that

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:39.020
people forget to change their
placeholder assets.

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:41.650
You need to make sure that you
have all the assets there and

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:45.060
that you update them from
placeholders and don't just

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:46.430
have 512 x 512.

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:48.185
Insert Image Here going out
there in the world.

00:22:48.185 --> 00:22:49.300
That's not so good.

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:52.100
Our console does give you a nice
little checklist, when

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:54.690
you go to publish, saying, hey,
we're missing this stuff.

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:56.150
So it's pretty simple
to make sure you've

00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:57.070
got that all right.

00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:59.110
And if you had descriptions
that were missing or

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:01.360
placeholder translations,
like [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:04.630
or something, you probably
want to change those too.

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:08.360
So as Dan mentioned, we have
two different kinds of

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:09.170
publishing.

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:12.740
You can publish both to the
services and to Google Play.

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:14.660
Now, in which order?

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:16.270
Well, pretty simple, right,
you want to make sure the

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:18.400
services work, before you
actually upload and APK that

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.350
calls those APIs.

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:22.550
If you do it the other way
around, things break.

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:24.230
Breaking isn't good.

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:28.790
The user experience is pretty
bad, if you put stuff out

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:29.150
doesn't work.

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:32.020
So we also want to make sure
that you publish it first, so

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:33.650
you can go through the
validation checklist.

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:35.600
Because there will be stuff that
goes wrong, and you want

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:36.680
to make sure there's
no validation

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:39.670
errors in that process.

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:42.460
So once you are published, we
have a nice little treat in

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:43.770
store for you .

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:45.750
As you get more users,
you will get badges.

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:46.880
We love badges.

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.180
Badges are great.

00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:49.395
So you unlock some
Achievements of

00:23:49.395 --> 00:23:51.070
your very, very own.

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:54.020
And you can get leaderboard
badge, and achievement badge,

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:57.120
and a multiplayer badge, if you
use all three, in the Play

00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.290
Store, right there.

00:23:58.290 --> 00:23:59.380
And your apps will stand out.

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:00.940
And people will know that you've
got these really cool

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:02.800
services there.

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.260
However, they're not just given
out because you had the

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:06.590
leaderboards in the config.

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:09.440
Or we don't snoop your APK and
check you're calling the APIs

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:10.290
from there.

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:12.830
We actually look at how much
your feature is being used.

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:14.820
And when we reach a certain
threshold, we

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:16.130
will give you a badge.

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:17.980
So you have to actually
integrate it.

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:20.840
It's not just a token thing that
you can do to get more

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.090
eyeballs in the store.

00:24:26.282 --> 00:24:29.150
And so far, we've really just
been talking about the one

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:32.640
app, "Angry Fruits," as we all
now in love and will dream

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.980
about for days to come.

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:40.320
But what if the smash hit "Angry
Fruit" is $0.99, and

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.873
it's just not really getting
that much traction?

00:24:42.873 --> 00:24:43.930
It's just not doing well.

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:47.270
And we want to try and launch
maybe a free version.

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:50.620
Well, the good news is, we
support that super-easily.

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:53.810
We basically just link all
the games together.

00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:55.330
How do we do that?

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:56.850
I'm sure you can guess by now.

00:24:56.850 --> 00:24:59.290
We go to the Linked App section
of the console.

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:01.140
And we select link
another app.

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:03.380
You can Link up to 20 different
apps here, including

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:05.500
your web management
app, that Jaewoong

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:06.980
showed you how to write.

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:10.440
And once you've got it full
of apps, what's in common?

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.390
We've got all these apps.

00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:13.440
But how do we know which
one's which and

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:14.360
what's going on there?

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:17.700
So achievements and leaderboards
within the same

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:20.820
game configuration are
global, so to speak.

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:24.500
And we'll talk a little more
about that in a moment.

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:27.410
There's also multiplayer,
because our system basically

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:29.110
sees them all as one game.

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:31.516
So they all play multiplayer
together.

00:25:31.516 --> 00:25:33.200
DANIEL GALPIN: That's
too much work.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:36.720
And besides, the free version
doesn't have the levels.

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.810
So we have a way of
handling that.

00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:40.390
So first of all, you're going to
want to prevent people who

00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:42.030
don't know each other
from automatching.

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:45.140
And the way to do this is to use
the variant, which you can

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:46.300
do when you're actually
building your

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:47.870
configuration for rooms.

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:52.330
But we actually also want people
who know each other to

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:55.120
be able to invite people,
regardless of whether they

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:55.940
actually have the game.

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:58.440
Because it's one way of
directing people to the game.

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:02.130
So what we suggest you do is
just handle this gracefully.

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:04.330
Consider it an opportunity to
upsell someone to the premium

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:06.440
version or to the new
version of the game.

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:09.160
And we have a lot more
information about multiplayer

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:12.720
coming on, in sessions that are
going to be in this room.

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.130
So just stay tuned here.

00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:16.570
And you'll learn all sorts of
great stuff about how to

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:17.500
implement multiplayer.

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:20.590
And also, the Advance Game
Topics talk talks about more

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:22.800
than just multiplayer, but has
a lot of really, really great

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:26.180
info about how to
implement games.

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:30.580
So there are a few cases where
you might want to prefer one

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:32.770
version of your game over
others, however, when someone

00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:35.100
gets invited to it.

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:36.640
Jaewoong, how do
we set that up?

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.400
JAEWOONG JUNG: OK.

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:41.840
So in the multiplayer invitation
you saw in the

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:45.210
previous talk, we sent the users
to the Play Store, if

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:46.810
they don't have the game.

00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:50.420
And if there are more multiple
versions, we let you decide

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:53.940
which is store entry to send
the users to with the check

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:56.400
box on the Play console.

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.000
How about the opposite case?

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.160
I mean, what if the user is
super-fan and has more than

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:05.090
one version installed?

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:08.530
In that case, when they hit
play, we will launch the one

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:12.320
you added most recently
on the Play console.

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.790
JENNIE LEES: That's
really good.

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:15.180
I want to be able to do
that and tell people

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:16.250
which game to launch.

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:17.670
That's really important.

00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:20.520
So in terms of multiple
games, let's talk a

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:21.810
little bit about sequels.

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:24.720
So it's Thanksgiving fairly
soon, I guess.

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:27.720
And I that "Angry Fruit Fall"
game is stuck in my brain.

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.690
I really want to make
that happen.

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:31.770
And it's not quite the same
as the original game.

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:32.940
And we're adding new content.

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:35.320
We want more Achievements, more
leaderboards, and brand

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:37.225
new graphics for everything.

00:27:37.225 --> 00:27:38.550
But how do I do that?

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:39.920
It's simple.

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:43.040
I add new resources in just the
same way as I added them

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.680
in the first place, as many as
you want, as long as you go

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:47.810
under the limit that the
console gives you.

00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:50.270
And it's pretty much
exactly the same.

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:53.300
And I'll just walk you through
how that works, when you've

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:56.330
got a game that's live and a
game that's in development, at

00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:57.790
the same time.

00:27:57.790 --> 00:28:00.915
So your game out there, "Angry
Fruit" has three achievements.

00:28:00.915 --> 00:28:03.060
And your users are super,
super happy.

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:04.010
And they want some more.

00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:06.340
So you add some more,
brilliant.

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:09.560
And at the same time, you're
going to change the visuals on

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:11.490
the existing achievements.

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:13.990
Now, while your version is
out there and your new

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:18.440
achievements are in draft mode,
live users will just see

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:19.270
the original three.

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:21.740
They won't see anything of the
new stuff you've uploaded.

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:25.590
However, your testers
see everything.

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:27.820
And they'll see your in-progress
graphics and mock

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:29.060
you for it.

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:32.700
Now, once you've hit publish,
everybody gets to see all the

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:34.640
achievements and
all the icons.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:35.970
And that's everybody.

00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:40.060
So if the original "Angry
Fruit" users have the

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:41.220
achievement UI.

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:43.510
They will see all the new
achievements, as well as the

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:44.170
original ones.

00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:45.820
But they can't unlock the
new ones, because you

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:47.280
never told them to.

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:48.660
The game doesn't
have the calls.

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:51.180
Or the APK doesn't have the
code in there to do it.

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:54.310
And in order to unlock it, they
need to get the new game.

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:56.930
So that's a great opportunity
for an upsell.

00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:57.330
Don't you think?

00:28:57.330 --> 00:29:00.400
You've got this achievement
list and a description.

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.630
Make the descriptions say, only
available in the brand

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:06.410
new smash hit "Angry Fruit
Fall." Or you can upgrade the

00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:08.910
original APK and add in the
calls to unlock the new

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:09.940
achievements in there.

00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:11.250
JAEWOONG JUNG: Well,
you know what?

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:14.460
There is something they
cannot change.

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:15.710
Let me show you.

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:22.260
So before an achievement is
published, you can't really

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:24.070
change its type.

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:27.450
A [INAUDIBLE] achievement can
be changed to an incremental

00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:30.700
achievement or to a hidden
achievement.

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:35.090
But once you make a choice and
publish it, the tie becomes

00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:41.390
permanent and cannot
be changed anymore.

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:44.730
Leaderboards have something that
becomes permanent after

00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:46.270
publishing too.

00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:47.710
Let's look at this one.

00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:52.890
The top player, who remarkably
resembles me, is smiling,

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:55.830
because he's leading on
a public leaderboard.

00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:58.590
He's the best to player in the
world, although there are only

00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:01.300
nine players at the moment.

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:05.110
However, if the developer
changes the leaderboard

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:09.370
ordering, the player will
suddenly find himself at the

00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:11.920
bottom of the leaderboard
and won't be

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:14.460
able to smile anymore.

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:17.470
Basically, we don't want to take
away something our user

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:19.680
already earned.

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:24.060
If a player, has earned rank, he
or she must be able to keep

00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:27.250
it until someone else beats
his or her score.

00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:30.700
In the same vein, you can't
re-publish the leaderboards or

00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:31.880
achievements.

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:34.960
We'll apply the same thinking
when we introduce the new

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.350
resource types in the future.

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:44.250
DANIEL GALPIN: So looking at
that leaderboard, those two

00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:47.240
top scores look really
suspicious.

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:49.120
And they're also not
wearing glass.

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:51.445
JAEWOONG JUNG: Hm,
that's right.

00:30:51.445 --> 00:30:54.430
They look suspicious,
which makes me

00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:57.920
introduce the next subject--

00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:00.020
managing.

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:03.170
"Angry Fruit Fall" went totally
viral and began to

00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:06.050
attract cheaters, as
Dan pointed out.

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:08.830
So how should you
deal with them?

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:11.630
Coming back to this leaderboard,
we now believe

00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:14.180
the first and the second
place are cheaters.

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:16.910
You want to hide them
from the game.

00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:20.960
So let's build an admin
website with

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:24.340
the hide player function.

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:26.950
Hiding a player is
really simple.

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:29.940
This short JavaScript code,
using the gapi object is

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:32.690
everything you need to write.

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:36.110
The hide method is a plain
RESTful API, where hidden

00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:37.900
players are represented
as a [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:39.850
resource in your game.

00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:43.290
So basically, you're
posting two new

00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:45.470
entries to the resource.

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:49.360
And for that, you only need to
your own application ID, which

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:52.850
you already know, and the player
ID you want a hide.

00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:55.060
Where do you get the player
IDs of the [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:56.080
users?

00:31:56.080 --> 00:32:00.780
They are included in the
userboard score responses.

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:06.280
After calling the hide method
with the two cheaters' IDs,

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:07.030
they are hidden.

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:09.660
And the leaderboard
is cleaned.

00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:13.030
JENNIE LEES: Wait, wait, wait,
you just hid my score.

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:14.290
But I'm not a cheater.

00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:19.780
I spent all night, like 24
hours, playing your game.

00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:20.773
Fix it.

00:32:20.773 --> 00:32:24.000
JAEWOONG JUNG: Oh, don't
worry, because

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.110
hiding is not banning.

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:28.060
Hidden users can still
play the game.

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:31.505
And their scores are still
recorded in the Google server.

00:32:31.505 --> 00:32:34.750
They just won't appear in
the game's leaderboards.

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:36.750
Let me explain why
this matters,

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:39.260
again with an example.

00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:41.070
It turns out Jennie
wasn't actually a

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:42.320
cheater, as she said.

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:44.330
And she just loves this
game so much.

00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:47.570
And she got disappointed because
you hid her scores.

00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:50.120
She made post something on
reddit, unless you do

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:53.210
something to her.

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:58.430
And this is why you need
the unhide player API.

00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:01.310
And you only need to call
this simple method

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:03.210
to revive her scores.

00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:07.120
Her scores will be restored,
normally, within a few hours.

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:11.550
And as I explained earlier,
hidden player list is a list

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:13.280
resource in your application.

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:19.750
So what this call does is
essentially deleting a player

00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:22.510
from the list.

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:24.100
But here's the problem.

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:26.340
How do you know her player ID?

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:29.250
Most players don't know their
player IDs, because we don't

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:31.660
have UI to show them.

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:35.750
So it's not like she can tell
you, my player ID is this,

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:36.230
this, this.

00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:38.190
Please give me back my scores.

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:39.340
But don't worry.

00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:41.500
There is not only one but
two ways to figure

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:44.610
out player's IDs.

00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:49.200
First, you provide this list
hidden players API.

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:52.360
Calling this will return all
hidden players public

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:55.890
profiles, including their
names and Player IDs.

00:33:55.890 --> 00:33:59.170
And again, this is
just getting the

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:01.350
Hidden Players resource.

00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:04.640
So if the innocent player's
name is found in the list,

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:08.300
like in this case, bingo.

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:10.860
Unfortunately, there's
a [INAUDIBLE] case?

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:12.820
Can you guess what?

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:17.429
When there are more multiple
players with the same name.

00:34:17.429 --> 00:34:20.810
Since the hidden player list
doesn't contain any personal

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:23.800
information, like email
addresses, except for their

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:27.909
names, it's impossible to
distinguish multiple people

00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:29.130
with the same name.

00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:31.139
And this is so why I previously
said that

00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:33.380
there are two ways.

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:34.489
What's the other way?

00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:38.670
You can find Player's IDs on
their Google+ profile pages.

00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:40.719
Let's take a look
at Jennie's one.

00:34:40.719 --> 00:34:42.760
You see this a long
number in the URL?

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:45.260
Yes, that's really long.

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:47.370
This is her Player ID.

00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:50.870
So you can either visit the
player's Google+ profile page

00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:53.320
yourself, or ask her
to just go and grab

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:54.594
the Player ID there.

00:34:54.594 --> 00:34:56.750
JENNIE LEES: But just don't use
that one, because I'm not

00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:57.670
actually a cheater.

00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:59.925
So don't hide me.

00:34:59.925 --> 00:35:03.950
JAEWOONG JUNG: After a few
hours, Jennie has returned.

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:06.720
Plus, if she got a higher score
while she was hidden,

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:09.530
the new score is shown
when she returns.

00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:16.980
By the way, since this community
management API is

00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:21.420
just a plain, easy-to-use,
RESTful API, then we can

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:24.590
anybody use it to hide the
people they dislike, for

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:27.280
example, someone?

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.910
Absolutely not.

00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:32.610
Because the users must sign in
to Google to use this API,

00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:34.650
Google knows who's calling it.

00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:38.010
And service to only a limited
set of people the project

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:39.620
owner permitted.

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:41.240
And how do you grant
the permission to

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:42.760
members of your team?

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:46.540
Some of you may be familiar
with this.

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:51.600
On the Play console, you can
invite others to be members of

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:54.990
your project team, like as
in this screen shot.

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:57.860
Only these members, including
yourself, will have the

00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:59.770
permission, others won't.

00:35:59.770 --> 00:36:04.490
And this is how you manage
your gamer community.

00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:09.180
So we just walked you through
the development, test, and

00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:12.390
publishing cycle and talked
about how you manage your

00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:14.010
gamer community.

00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:16.160
You now have all the
information at your

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:20.060
fingertips, to set up and
publish your million-dollar

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:21.240
game franchise.

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:23.180
DANIEL GALPIN: And remember,
all this sample code is

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:24.760
available on the
developers.google.com

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:27.022
documentation for games.

00:36:27.022 --> 00:36:29.135
JENNIE LEES: And as Dan
mentioned, there are talks on

00:36:29.135 --> 00:36:31.450
the games services, in this
room, coming up after this.

00:36:31.450 --> 00:36:32.440
So please come back.

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.930
And we'll be in the office
hours in the Play sandbox

00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:37.590
upstairs, if you want to ask us
any questions about games.

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:40.380
And of course, in that sandbox,
there are a hands-on

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:42.000
stations where you can
get to play more

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.920
than 16 of our games.

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:45.275
And try them all out.

00:36:45.275 --> 00:36:47.200
Let us know what you think.

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.440
JAEWOONG JUNG: Thank
you for coming.

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:49.690
DANIEL GALPIN: Yeah, thank you.
