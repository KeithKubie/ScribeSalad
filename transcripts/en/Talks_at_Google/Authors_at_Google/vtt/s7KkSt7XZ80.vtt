BORIS DEBIC: Welcome,
everybody, to one more Authors

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.660
at Google show at Google.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.240
Today, our author is
a very special one.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.870
He's a musical
author-- Al Di Meola.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.790
Please give him a warm
welcome here at Google.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.734
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.940
I am not going to read his
prolifically long biography.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.950
And probably half of
you know it already,

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.510
and you can use the
search engine anyway.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.910
You will find a lot about
him written the intertubes.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.990
I will do a little read
up for our audiences

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.060
out there, though.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.420
So in 1971, Di Meola enrolled
in Berklee College of Music

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.720
in Boston, and in 1974,
started his musical journey.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.870
In addition to his
prolific solo career,

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.060
he's shared the stage with
Chick Corea, Stanley Clark,

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.240
Jan Hammer, Carlos Santana, Joan
McLaughlin, the late Paco de

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.050
Lucia, and Luciano Pavarotti
to mention just a few names

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.020
from a long list
of collaborators.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.250
Al coinvented invented fusion,
being one of the earliest

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.680
pioneers of the genre.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.290
And here's an interesting bit.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.170
He also co-created the concept
of the touring trio of equals

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.760
after replacing Larry Coryell
in the acoustic guitar

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.840
group The Guitar Trio
and bring the concept

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.800
to widespread attention.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.710
Al is a frequent at the
top of the US jazz charts.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.590
He has amassed over
20 albums as a leader

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.710
while collaborating
on a dozen of others,

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.470
including with the
godfather of fusion,

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.010
the earlier-mentioned Larry
Coryell, and Barry Miles,

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.720
who's tape recording
launched Al's career

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.790
in subsequent
collaboration with Corea.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:08.380
He has been selected 11 times
as winner in best jazz guitarist

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.350
by the Guitar Player
Magazine reader poll.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.640
Guitar Player Magazine
is actually in San Bruno,

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.700
where YouTube is, as well.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.030
If jazz is the original and most
influential American art forum,

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.420
then Al Di Meola
is certainly one

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.450
of its most visible contemporary
composers and performers.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.500
He has become respected as
one of the most influential

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.220
guitarists in jazz to date.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.640
A native of New Jersey who still
resides in the Garden State, Al

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.710
Di Meola was born in Jersey
City on July 22, 1954,

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.010
growing up in Bergenfield with
the music of Elvis Presley,

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.570
The Ventures, and the Beatles.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.933
Please join me in welcoming
Al Di Meola to Google.

00:02:53.933 --> 00:02:55.308
AL DI MEOLA: Thank
you very much.

00:02:55.308 --> 00:02:57.798
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:01.735 --> 00:03:03.110
AL DI MEOLA: It
was a great start

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.640
to the day to google
Google just to get here.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.217
But I'm very happy to
be participating today.

00:03:11.217 --> 00:03:12.300
Thanks for the invitation.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.246
BORIS DEBIC: We are
honored to have you here.

00:03:14.246 --> 00:03:15.370
AL DI MEOLA: This is great.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.680
BORIS DEBIC: You are a
legend a lot of these people

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.460
have listened to half
their lives if not longer.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.820
So where shall we start?

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.890
With the beginnings, I guess.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.567
I found this little tidbit.

00:03:28.567 --> 00:03:29.525
AL DI MEOLA: Which one?

00:03:29.525 --> 00:03:35.370
BORIS DEBIC: That your sister
was influential in developing

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.214
you as a musician.

00:03:36.214 --> 00:03:38.630
AL DI MEOLA: Well, only because
she was seven years older.

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.380
So she was the one--
as I was a child,

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.700
she was the one that
came home with the 45s,

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.350
with the hit records.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.350
And I got to hear the music.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.960
And a lot of it was
quite inspiring.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.430
I guess the late
'50s, early '60s

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.520
were groundbreaking
in terms of sound.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.670
The change over into
the '60s was something

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:12.210
that we haven't seen since-- the
most inspiring creative period

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.630
of change was during
that whole decade.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.800
So she was largely
responsible for turning me

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.120
on to a lot of those
hits at the time.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.960
Even the Beach Boys
were quite a sensation.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.680
But it was the Beatles
that really did it for me.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.010
And instrumental groups
like The Ventures

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.790
and all for the real guitar
heads, the surf bands,

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.610
and stuff like that.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.280
And then from there, then
you had all the English music

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.430
that came over that
was groundbreaking and

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.397
revolutionary, really.

00:04:45.397 --> 00:04:46.230
BORIS DEBIC: Indeed.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.410
Indeed it was.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.560
AL DI MEOLA:
Compared to the '50s.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.130
BORIS DEBIC: So
tell me something.

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.434
How was it growing
up in New Jersey?

00:04:53.434 --> 00:04:54.350
That's very close to--

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:55.452
AL DI MEOLA: It was great.

00:04:55.452 --> 00:04:57.660
BORIS DEBIC: There's a lot
of things happening there.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.076
AL DI MEOLA: It
is a perfect place

00:04:59.076 --> 00:05:01.410
to grow up, because it
was quite middle class,

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.930
but it was close proximity
to New York City.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.240
So we had all the record stores
that we needed all around us,

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.540
but we also had bus
transportation to take us

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.040
right into New York to
see the greatest shows

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.420
any night of the week.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.440
So if I wasn't
down in the Village

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.440
seeing something at
the Fillmore East,

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.530
Bill Graham's
Fillmore East where

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.700
I got to see all
of those bands, all

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.750
of the legendary
bands from America,

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.660
from England on a weekly basis.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:39.020
Just walking past Hendrix's
studio, Electric Lady Studio,

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:44.290
and the smell in the air,
the hippies everywhere.

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:49.660
It was a quite inspiring time.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.270
And I just soaked it all in.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.010
And then in that same period,
I was visiting Latin clubs

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.660
by myself, absorbing
the Latin music,

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.930
and then later, the jazz
clubs that were everywhere

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.080
to be found.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.620
So I was so fortunate
to grow up in Jersey

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.097
to have that proximity as
opposed to the Midwest.

00:06:09.097 --> 00:06:10.930
BORIS DEBIC: Did you
pick up the clubs first

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.480
or the guitar first?

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.910
AL DI MEOLA: No, the guitar.

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.230
Guitar was around
eight, nine years old.

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.380
I wasn't going to any
clubs at that time.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.270
So did you play with Barry
before you went to college?

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.830
AL DI MEOLA: Well, Barry
Miles was the first time

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.710
I went to Berklee
School of Music,

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.730
and we discovered
Barry's records.

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:35.200
He's really the first fusion
guy ever, before anyone.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.774
He kind of invented fusion.

00:06:36.774 --> 00:06:37.690
BORIS DEBIC: OK, stop.

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.140
I've got to stop you right here.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.790
So for people who
are 16 now and who

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.890
are like, what is this
guy talking about, fusion?

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:48.770
Could you illustrate to us what
is fusion, and what is the--

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.620
AL DI MEOLA: Fusion was
really the culmination

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.842
of rock blending with
elements of jazz, primarily.

00:06:55.842 --> 00:06:58.050
BORIS DEBIC: Is there a way
to show that on a guitar,

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.400
by any chance?

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.140
AL DI MEOLA: No.

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:00.640
But anyway--

00:07:06.254 --> 00:07:08.170
BORIS DEBIC: I'll get
him to take that guitar.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:08.930
Trust me.

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:10.263
AL DI MEOLA: Of course there is.

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:15.890
Well, we have other elements
that we infuse-- Latin rhythms,

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:19.020
classical elements as well.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.715
So I would take something
from a classical realm,

00:07:21.715 --> 00:07:27.810
and I would syncopate the
rhythm to give it a swing.

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.830
Or it could be
something that-- it

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:34.400
could be a Beatles song, which
you would relate to pop music.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.600
But some of that music had
such beautiful harmony.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.990
Of course, it had
a great melody.

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:41.630
But it had beautiful
harmony, which

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:44.410
gives you the basis
for improvisation

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:45.820
if you want to do that.

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:47.890
Because the Beatles
really never did that.

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:50.010
The focus was on the
lyric and the voice

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:54.700
and the beautiful
song in itself.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:58.070
I had the good
fortune of coming up

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:01.290
with the idea of
recording a record

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:03.070
of a collection of their work.

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:07.062
But then doing it at
Abbey Road made it

00:08:07.062 --> 00:08:09.990
like going to Disney
World as a kid.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:12.419
BORIS DEBIC: And we'll come
to that later on in the talk.

00:08:12.419 --> 00:08:13.960
AL DI MEOLA: So you
can take harmony.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.550
You can take simple harmony
and improvise on it,

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:18.520
maybe change the
harmony a little bit.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.100
And then you have elements
of jazz in that sense,

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.530
because you're improvising
with scales as opposed to rock

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:27.750
pentatonic licks.

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:30.390
Rock pentatonic licks really
involve your first finger

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:32.240
and your third finger.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.820
You'll never see
a rock guitarist

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.669
use his second finger,
except for when

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:38.450
he's mad at somebody,
and his pinkie.

00:08:41.058 --> 00:08:43.179
How do you like that?

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:43.929
Watch Clapton.

00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:46.110
He only uses his first
and third finger.

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:47.260
Because they're not--

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.440
BORIS DEBIC: And he's
called the god of guitar.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.060
AL DI MEOLA: Well,
back then, he was.

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.310
BORIS DEBIC: Back then he was.

00:08:54.692 --> 00:08:55.900
So I was thinking about this.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.120
The trio that you later
did with Paco de Lucia

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:03.760
and John McLaughlin were
three equals on guitars,

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:07.680
come and play-- that invented,
actually, a whole new genre

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.320
of-- you had trios before.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.750
I read somewhere that
in classical music,

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:17.190
there were trios in the 1800s.

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:20.830
But those were like a cello
and piano and something else.

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:22.800
It's not the same instrument.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.440
So these guys sit together
and they play guitars

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.030
all between themselves.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:31.990
I said to myself if Clapton
is the god of guitar--

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:33.590
and sorry for the blasphemy.

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:35.810
He meant it as inspiration.

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:38.820
Then these guys are
the holy trinity.

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.970
AL DI MEOLA: Well, it
was a certain technique

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:45.310
that we had-- Paco coming from
a flamenco tradition, which

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:47.560
John and I did not come from.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.140
But I was kind of like the guy
in the middle, the guy that

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:54.410
came from a Latin background--
not necessarily flamenco--

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:57.010
and John coming from a whole
different kind of thing,

00:09:57.010 --> 00:10:01.340
more Indian influenced
and very British in a way.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.520
And so it just
worked, because we

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.800
had a certain
degree of technique

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:09.760
that we could communicate and
converse back and forth with.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.910
And we were probably three
of the only guys that

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:13.810
could do that at that time.

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:16.700
So we made this record in 1980.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:21.710
After two months of touring
every single night starting

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:24.400
in Europe, we just
built up our chops.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.810
And we were on fire by the
time we got San Francisco,

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:30.280
and recorded a
record that became

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.510
this multi-zillion selling
record of a live record, which

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:36.500
at the time cost about
$2,000 or $3,000 to make

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.920
and sold something like
5 to 10 million copies,

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.160
somewhere in between.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.880
We'll never know for sure
where the royalty went.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:46.585
But it was a huge record
called "Friday Night

00:10:46.585 --> 00:10:48.280
in San Francisco."

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:48.890
Yeah.

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:49.840
Some of you know it.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.520
BORIS DEBIC: You got that.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:52.810
Show it to the camera.

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:54.350
AL DI MEOLA: You know, there's
a number on the back of it.

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:55.740
It will tell me if I got paid.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:57.131
Let me see.

00:10:57.131 --> 00:10:58.380
There's a serial number on it.

00:10:58.380 --> 00:10:58.590
No.

00:10:58.590 --> 00:10:59.340
You owe me a buck.

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:05.880
Look at that, how
ridiculous I look in there.

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.620
That's great.

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:09.840
There's actually a "Saturday
Night in San Francisco,"

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:15.480
too that I have in my studio
that will be released someday

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.794
on a little chip, probably.

00:11:17.794 --> 00:11:18.460
BORIS DEBIC: OK.

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:21.990
We jumped a little bit,
so I wanted to go back.

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:23.110
We mentioned the trio.

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:25.680
The trio actually
has its origins

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.910
with Larry Correal,
who was christened

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:31.530
the godfather of fusion.

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:33.292
So can you talk a
little bit about--

00:11:33.292 --> 00:11:35.750
AL DI MEOLA: Larry was a big
hero of mine when I was a kid.

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:38.350
So he was really the
first guitar player

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:41.050
that blended all the elements.

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:44.340
He's really a jazz guy that
brought in rock elements

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:46.280
and country music elements.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.670
Right after the heyday
of that whole rock

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:52.940
scene and the Fillmore East, I
was looking for something more.

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:56.140
And he was the guy that I became
familiar with and friendly

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:56.970
with.

00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:00.040
And I actually took a lesson
from him, too, at one point.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.012
BORIS DEBIC: Can you share the
lesson with the young viewers?

00:12:03.012 --> 00:12:04.970
AL DI MEOLA: You want me
to remember the lesson

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:06.310
from when I was 15?

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:07.831
BORIS DEBIC: Was
it a guitar lesson?

00:12:07.831 --> 00:12:09.580
AL DI MEOLA: Yeah, it
was a guitar lesson.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:10.246
BORIS DEBIC: Oh.

00:12:10.246 --> 00:12:12.670
I thought it was one of
those philosophical lessons.

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:13.420
AL DI MEOLA: Yeah.

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.705
He was tripping the whole
time, so I'm not sure

00:12:15.705 --> 00:12:18.074
if it was usable
whatever he showed me.

00:12:18.074 --> 00:12:18.740
BORIS DEBIC: OK.

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:21.320
Maybe not the right lesson
for our younger audience.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.903
AL DI MEOLA: But
he's a wonderful guy.

00:12:22.903 --> 00:12:24.500
He's still around.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:29.900
He's kind of like the Keith
Richards of fusion music.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:32.199
I don't know how he
lived through it all.

00:12:32.199 --> 00:12:33.740
BORIS DEBIC: That's
very nice of you.

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:36.520
We have a couple of people who
have a burning question there.

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:38.139
So sir.

00:12:38.139 --> 00:12:38.680
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.880
Can you give us a story from
when you came to San Francisco

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:41.640
for that album?

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:42.630
AL DI MEOLA: A story about it?

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:43.255
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:12:43.255 --> 00:12:44.330
Something you can you.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:45.720
AL DI MEOLA: Oh.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.160
We didn't do a
lot in the States.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.130
I think we did New York,
and we just did maybe

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:53.710
Chicago, and then LA
and San Francisco.

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:56.910
Because it was at the end
of a huge European tour.

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:59.400
And San Francisco
just turned out

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.900
to be the last of two months.

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:05.300
The chops weer really up
there, so our communication

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:06.670
was really quick.

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:10.020
And it created a good
really good environment

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:13.300
for the audience to witness.

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.470
I listen to those
records now, and I can't

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:20.680
believe how fast we played.

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:25.080
It's almost like, is that me?

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:31.290
It was a stunning performance
by those guys, too.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:33.680
But it was right
around the time-- god,

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:37.640
I remember being--
it was probably right

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.340
around the time Lennon got shot.

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:44.580
Because I was at the hotel
in San Francisco, and I

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.270
saw it on the news.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:48.740
It was a very memorable time.

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:50.717
It was December 1980.

00:13:50.717 --> 00:13:53.300
BORIS DEBIC: I think this may
be the right time to maybe break

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.110
it for a little performance.

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:57.064
AL DI MEOLA: You want
to hear something?

00:13:57.064 --> 00:13:58.480
I don't mean the
song "Something,"

00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.507
but I mean something.

00:13:59.507 --> 00:14:01.382
BORIS DEBIC: You guys
want to hear something?

00:14:01.382 --> 00:14:02.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:04.255
BORIS DEBIC: All right.

00:14:04.255 --> 00:14:07.680
Well, that's why we're here.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:12.330
I would like to introduce my
percussionist of 75 years we've

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.570
been playing together.

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:16.380
This is Gumby Ortiz.

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:18.816
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:53.670
BORIS DEBIC: Thank you.

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:54.970
This was beautiful.

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:56.334
Question from the audience.

00:18:56.334 --> 00:18:58.250
AUDIENCE: Your instruments,
Al, your guitars--

00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:00.770
how many guitars do you own?

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:02.730
AL DI MEOLA: About two or three.

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:04.789
I sold the rest of them.

00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:06.580
AUDIENCE: I know it's
a lot more than that.

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:09.594
So the other night, I had
the pleasure to see you play,

00:19:09.594 --> 00:19:11.010
and you were playing
with a guitar

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:14.120
that I guess you
recorded on 20 years ago.

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:17.040
We're here we're in the
epicenter of technology

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.870
and technological advancements.

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:24.010
I found the statement you
made about that guitar--

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:27.110
and other musicians do as
well-- these old instruments

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:29.090
that play better than new.

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:31.160
You would think
that advancements

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.150
would occur in technology
and today's guitars

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:34.900
would play better.

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:36.450
Can you discuss that at all?

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:37.200
AL DI MEOLA: Yeah.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:42.560
Well, acoustic guitars, as they
age, they can sound better.

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:45.960
Electric guitars,
sometimes the same is true.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:49.340
But that one I was
playing in LA was one

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:52.240
that I actually sold
to someone but I used

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:55.370
on some of my early recordings.

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:57.900
So it was nice to
reconnect with it again.

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:00.020
Because it has a
particular sound.

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:02.930
Each guitar has its
own characteristics.

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:04.370
I was kidding, Jim.

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:05.670
Jim is a good friend of mine.

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:09.610
But I have about somewhere in
the neighborhood of 70 guitars

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:13.200
that I've just acquired,
but I didn't buy them all.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.690
Companies give them
to try them out,

00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:17.370
and they don't
ask for them back.

00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:19.990
But out of those, maybe 10
of them are very valuable,

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:21.490
I would say.

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:23.290
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:25.660
What advice would
you give to people

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:27.380
who are starting
out playing guitar,

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:33.750
even advanced but obviously
not as good as you?

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:35.440
BORIS DEBIC: Nobody
is as good as Al.

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.231
AUDIENCE: Becoming a
ripping guitar player,

00:20:37.231 --> 00:20:39.100
what should I do?

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:41.496
AL DI MEOLA: You want to
make a living at doing this?

00:20:41.496 --> 00:20:43.620
AUDIENCE: I think I make
a pretty good living here.

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:44.953
AL DI MEOLA: Playing the guitar?

00:20:44.953 --> 00:20:45.910
AUDIENCE: No.

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:47.290
AL DI MEOLA: Working at Google?

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:48.040
AUDIENCE: Correct.

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.340
AL DI MEOLA: Stay with it.

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:54.390
Trust me.

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:57.360
I'm applying right
after this, by the way.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:00.220
The music business
is getting rough.

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.760
AUDIENCE: All right I'll
take that into account.

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:05.750
AL DI MEOLA: Just do it for
fun, because it's really

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:09.140
brutal out there.

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:11.990
You don't want to make a career
out of playing guitar today.

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:14.790
Holy Christ.

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:18.320
You had a wonderful opportunity
in the '70s and into the '80s,

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.610
but then things declined.

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:23.150
Look at music today.

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:25.750
When you have Kanye West
out there, holy Christ.

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:29.480
I always seem to
just keep a quarter

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:35.030
note going so that
my rhythms-- I could

00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:37.450
syncopate against the time.

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:39.350
And if what I syncopated
from the upper half

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:44.570
of the body, which is where
this happens-- none of that

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:47.540
would matter if the time moves.

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:49.280
So I could play
syncopations against it.

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.510
And what usually
happens is guitar

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:04.580
players think they
have-- most of them

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:06.210
think they have great time.

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:09.950
And then I'd have them in
a clinic all tap their foot

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:12.050
and then play a syncopation
against the time

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:14.680
and watch every foot go off.

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:18.580
So what I do is I have
everybody slow it way, way,

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:25.020
way down until you can get
in tune to your lower half.

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:31.430
Because the key for me is
that-- timing and playing

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:32.816
against the time.

00:22:32.816 --> 00:22:34.190
That's what makes
it interesting.

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:40.420
Rhythm is the number one element
first that pulls people in.

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:42.060
The other elements
you can learn.

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:44.317
Harmony you can learn.

00:22:44.317 --> 00:22:45.900
But as far as rhythm,
that's the thing

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:47.865
that grabs people immediately.

00:22:47.865 --> 00:22:49.990
AUDIENCE: You were talking
about tapping your foot,

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:51.930
and I'm wondering
do you ever-- I

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:54.800
know you play a lot of Latin
music, like Clavier, Montuno.

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.750
Do you ever try and tap
the Clavier with your foot

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:00.040
as you play Montuno
just for an exercise?

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:02.720
AL DI MEOLA: Well, no, but
I play it on the instrument.

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:19.860
So if we did the
beginning of "Senor Mouse"

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:21.030
you know what I mean?

00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:21.300
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:22.280
I just had a follow on question.

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.950
You said what happened,
and actually, I

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:25.780
wanted to ask you what happened.

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:28.261
I'm also jazz musician and
had a lot of gigs in the '80s

00:23:28.261 --> 00:23:30.010
and early '90s, and
then they just kind of

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:32.970
dried up the last 10 years.

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:34.500
AL DI MEOLA: Oh,
you mean the scene?

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:36.458
AUDIENCE: Yeah, the scene,
the whole jazz scene

00:23:36.458 --> 00:23:39.130
and anything that that's
more than just a beat.

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:41.460
AL DI MEOLA: Well, that's
because before this

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:46.590
and computers, when we got into
our car, we went to the stereo.

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:51.730
Now we go here and we've got
to return this person's call.

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:53.290
And somebody's calling.

00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:54.532
Hello?

00:23:54.532 --> 00:23:59.001
You get to the house, you
don't run to your stereo ever.

00:23:59.001 --> 00:24:00.000
You run to the computer.

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:04.650
So no one is focused anymore.

00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:05.840
Music is important.

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:10.470
We need music to survive,
or as a society, we go nuts.

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:13.280
But it became secondary.

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:16.100
Whereas before these things--
these are wonderful things,

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:19.950
by the way-- we were
totally focused,

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:22.160
just like musicians in a studio.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:25.000
I have my band
record-- not Gumby.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.387
He's the only one that
comes from the old school.

00:24:28.387 --> 00:24:30.220
I'm saying that because
he's here right now.

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:31.710
He knows it.

00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:33.090
But not, that's true.

00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:36.080
So we'd cut a take,
and they'd all

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:38.640
go out in the hallway
on their computers,

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:42.220
checking their emails
and checking their text

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:45.390
and everything while I'm in
listening to the playback.

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:50.450
Now, back in the '70s, we'd
all rush into the control room,

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:51.780
because we were all involved.

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:56.340
That's why those records from
that period sound phenomenal.

00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:58.410
Everybody was focused.

00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:01.340
Today, we have too
many variables,

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:03.770
too much to choose
from, too many people,

00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:04.910
too much networking.

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:08.010
We're networking
all over the place.

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:11.260
So the focus is gone.

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:12.864
That's my take on it.

00:25:12.864 --> 00:25:13.780
And I think I'm right.

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:21.500
AUDIENCE: Once you established
yourself in the US,

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:22.942
you started traveling around.

00:25:22.942 --> 00:25:24.900
AL DI MEOLA: I was at
Berkeley School of Music,

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:28.340
and I got a call from
Chick to join the band.

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:31.207
He says, I heard this tape that
your friend might play for me.

00:25:31.207 --> 00:25:33.040
And I've got to tell
you, we're knocked out.

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.640
We'd love for you
to join the band.

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:37.290
Could you come to
New York like now?

00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:42.700
We had about two or three
days rehearsal and 11 charts,

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:44.485
about seven pages long.

00:25:44.485 --> 00:25:46.580
And luckily, I knew
how to read music.

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:48.930
And I was scared out of my mind.

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:53.340
Because Return to Forever was
my favorite band at the time--

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:58.090
electric guitar in the
forefront kind of band.

00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:03.560
And that was one of the
three pioneering fusion

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:06.670
bands-- Weather Report being
one, Mavishnu Orchestra,

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:07.980
and Return to Forever.

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:11.610
And Return to Forever
was maybe even more so,

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:13.420
because it was the
compositional band.

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:17.340
It had the most intricate
compositions and interesting.

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:21.280
So I was more influenced by
Chick and Return to Forever.

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:24.700
And Beatles were my
other favorite band,

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:27.470
but I knew there was ever
a way for that to happen.

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:29.900
But those were my
two favorite bands.

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:33.720
And funny thing is, we went into
the studio-- I was still 19--

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:37.610
we did Carnegie Hall, and
then we did some stadiums.

00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:39.550
Part of the Newport
Jazz Festival,

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:41.880
we did Houston Astro
Dome, Cincinnati Stadium,

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:46.087
Atlanta Stadium as part of
this whole big festival thing.

00:26:46.087 --> 00:26:48.170
And then we went right
into the studio in New York

00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:50.000
at the record plant.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.960
And speaking of the
Beatles, John Lennon

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.050
was in the next room.

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:55.930
So I got to peak in
every now and then

00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:58.570
and watch him at the
board doing his thing.

00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:03.320
I was in a state of shock
with the whole thing.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:04.520
It was a dream come true.

00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:10.920
BORIS DEBIC: What do you
think of-- so guitar in Africa

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.360
is very interesting.

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:15.690
And we know there's a
lot of musicians, very--

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:16.650
AL DI MEOLA: Africa?

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:17.290
BORIS DEBIC: In Africa, yes.

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:18.750
AL DI MEOLA: It's very,
very rich for music.

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:19.830
BORIS DEBIC: Yes.

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:24.760
But what about-- I'm puzzled
by this lack of-- there's

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:27.140
a lot of people in Asia.

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:30.310
I managed to find a
couple of composers which

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:31.670
compose for guitar in China.

00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:33.210
But that's really
classical stuff.

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:36.190
It's not the popular stuff.

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:39.060
There are performers
in Japan, I guess.

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:41.610
That's where you can find them.

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:46.220
AL DI MEOLA: We haven't found
a lot from China that's--

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:48.170
BORIS DEBIC: Do they
miss an Al Di Meola

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:52.470
touring a little bit there
and opening their eyes

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:53.630
to the instrument?

00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:55.380
AL DI MEOLA: I don't
know about China yet.

00:27:55.380 --> 00:28:00.390
I think it's the next frontier
that should and could open,

00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:02.190
like Russia opened.

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:04.460
And I've toured all over
Russia-- Siberia, all

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:07.465
across the 11 time zones.

00:28:07.465 --> 00:28:09.090
When that opened,
that was really cool.

00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:11.200
BORIS DEBIC: They did have the
balalaika through centuries

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:11.660
as well.

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:12.050
AL DI MEOLA: Huh?

00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:14.280
BORIS DEBIC: They did have the
balalaika through centuries.

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.080
AL DI MEOLA: Yeah.

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:18.110
But they had a tremendous
understanding and depth

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:20.620
of appreciation for the music.

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:21.310
Unbelievable.

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:23.656
China, I don't know,
except for Hong Kong

00:28:23.656 --> 00:28:24.780
I played a number of times.

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:27.240
But it was a little bit
different than mainland.

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.840
I haven't yet done that.

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:30.490
I've done Korea
a number of times

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:31.960
and Japan a whole lot of times.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.692
BORIS DEBIC: What is your take?

00:28:36.692 --> 00:28:38.566
AL DI MEOLA: The Mideast
is very interesting,

00:28:38.566 --> 00:28:40.460
because there's been
a great demand for me

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:43.760
to play in places like Iran.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.645
And I'd love to
do that, actually.

00:28:45.645 --> 00:28:47.145
And there, I could
be an ambassador.

00:28:47.145 --> 00:28:52.170
I'd probably get this nuclear
arms thing straightened out.

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:53.980
I would request that
I have a meeting

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:55.950
with one of the
guys, the mullahs

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:57.590
or whatever his name is.

00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:59.160
I can't forget North
Korea, because I

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:02.090
want to get some o
that money Rodman got.

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:05.150
Anyway, that's another story.

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:07.680
I played in places like
Tunisia and Algeria.

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.520
Last year, we played Algeria.

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:13.830
And the appreciation for
the music is out of control.

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:15.330
It's really great.

00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:20.070
Way greater than
even New Jersey.

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:21.870
BORIS DEBIC: There
you go, New Jersey.

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:23.420
We have questions there.

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:24.360
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.750
I'm just curious-- could
you give us a little bit

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:29.940
of a background of how you
evolved to who you are today

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:34.502
from your family atmosphere as
a child and how you got the--

00:29:34.502 --> 00:29:36.710
AL DI MEOLA: Well, I had
the typical Italian American

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:37.870
tension in the house.

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:42.750
So I would go upstairs
to get away from it.

00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:47.370
And that kind of stress I
took out on my instrument.

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:51.570
It was actually wonderful.

00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:53.990
It was a very secure
feeling having

00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:58.500
parents right there down
below and my own little space

00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:03.910
upstairs to listen and dream.

00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:06.640
And the proximity
to New York, going

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:10.430
to the shows-- and a friend
of mine a few houses away

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:13.180
had an amazing garage
where we practiced.

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:18.450
And it was just a perfect
childhood experience.

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:23.840
So I evolved, I
guess, because I felt

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:28.060
it very early on that
I was going to do this.

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:30.710
I wanted to make it
when I was young.

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:38.130
And I had a drive that became
super strong after an accident

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:41.410
I had that where I
almost lost my life.

00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:44.540
And right after getting out of
the hospital after two months,

00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:49.220
I had this tremendous
burning drive to do this.

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:54.100
So it could be a little
connection to upstairs.

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:55.895
I'm not sure.

00:30:55.895 --> 00:30:57.270
BORIS DEBIC: To
the pearly gates?

00:30:57.270 --> 00:30:58.853
AL DI MEOLA: But
that's what happened.

00:30:58.853 --> 00:30:59.390
Yeah.

00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:00.348
BORIS DEBIC: All right.

00:31:00.348 --> 00:31:02.930
So now we're going to do it a
little bit of machine learning

00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:03.460
stuff.

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:06.100
So machine learning
is a way for computers

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:08.450
to do stuff on their own.

00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:11.760
So they don't need
programmers and all that.

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:15.010
And I thought it
would be a good thing

00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:17.720
to construct a feature
vector out of you.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:20.440
And these guys understand
what I'm talking about.

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:24.280
But the idea actually comes
from the Actor's Studio series

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.110
with James Lipton.

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:30.770
He does the Proust
questionnaire.

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:32.440
I thought ah, that
would be interesting.

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:35.010
So he has already a
whole bunch of actors.

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:38.110
Let's do a guitarist, and then
the machine learning people

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:40.330
will be able to
differentiate and figure out

00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:46.830
how to build the perfect guitar
playing computer in 357 years.

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:48.610
So are you up for it?

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:49.930
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah.

00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:50.760
Fire away.

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:52.375
BORIS DEBIC: I'll
shoot the question.

00:31:52.375 --> 00:31:55.010
And this is supposed
to be answered quickly,

00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:57.900
because we don't want
you to think too much.

00:31:57.900 --> 00:31:59.790
It's from the heart.

00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:01.531
What is your favorite word?

00:32:01.531 --> 00:32:02.780
AL DI MEOLA: My favorite work?

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:03.610
BORIS DEBIC: Word.

00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:05.710
AL DI MEOLA: Word.

00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:10.480
[SIGHS] That was it.

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:11.460
Let's see.

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:12.319
My favorite word.

00:32:12.319 --> 00:32:13.485
Don't think too much, right?

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:20.758
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:32:20.758 --> 00:32:23.004
It's an Italian word.

00:32:23.004 --> 00:32:24.920
BORIS DEBIC: What is
your least favorite word?

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:28.680
AL DI MEOLA: Can't do it.

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.599
Can't.

00:32:30.599 --> 00:32:31.890
BORIS DEBIC: What turns you on?

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:36.330
AL DI MEOLA: Music.

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:38.752
BORIS DEBIC: What turns you off?

00:32:38.752 --> 00:32:39.460
AL DI MEOLA: Rap.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.530
BORIS DEBIC: What sound
or noise do you love?

00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:51.700
AL DI MEOLA: My
daughter and my fiance.

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:55.870
BORIS DEBIC: What sound
or noise do you hate?

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:56.676
AL DI MEOLA: My ex.

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:01.610
BORIS DEBIC: What is
your favorite curse word?

00:33:05.882 --> 00:33:07.090
AL DI MEOLA: There's so many.

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:13.620
Fuck.

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:16.060
BORIS DEBIC: What profession
other than your own

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.235
would you like to attempt?

00:33:20.447 --> 00:33:21.322
AL DI MEOLA: Fireman.

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:27.620
BORIS DEBIC: What profession
would you not like to do?

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:30.925
AL DI MEOLA: Janitor.

00:33:34.045 --> 00:33:35.170
BORIS DEBIC: What is your--

00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:36.720
AL DI MEOLA: Oh, I should've
said to tour manager.

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:37.580
I'm sorry.

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:38.810
He's sitting right there.

00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:39.970
I missed a chance.

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:45.601
BORIS DEBIC: Give a hand to
the touring manager, please.

00:33:45.601 --> 00:33:48.247
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:48.247 --> 00:33:50.110
AL DI MEOLA: It's a brutal job.

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:51.460
I wouldn't want to work for me.

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:54.380
BORIS DEBIC: What is
your favorite chord?

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:56.130
AL DI MEOLA: My favorite
chord, very good.

00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:58.492
It's a seven flat nine.

00:33:58.492 --> 00:34:01.600
BORIS DEBIC: What is your
least favorite chord?

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:03.100
AL DI MEOLA: My
least favorite chord

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:06.510
is just a plain major chord.

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:07.820
BORIS DEBIC: Any in particular?

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:11.530
AL DI MEOLA: C.

00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:14.760
BORIS DEBIC: And the last
one-- if heaven exists,

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:17.250
what would you like
to hear God say when

00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:19.120
you arrive at the pearly gates?

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:21.420
AL DI MEOLA: You did great.

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:23.075
BORIS DEBIC: Get
him a hand, please.

00:34:23.075 --> 00:34:25.500
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:27.929 --> 00:34:28.834
Thank you, Al.

00:34:28.834 --> 00:34:29.570
All right.

00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:32.780
What are you doing
these days, and what

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:37.139
keeps your interests
fired up, so to speak?

00:34:37.139 --> 00:34:40.135
And where are you going?

00:34:40.135 --> 00:34:43.060
AL DI MEOLA: I try to
remain inspired or find

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:44.820
new inspiration to write.

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:47.100
I love writing music.

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:50.150
And sometimes, you go
into these little lulls

00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:51.860
where you're looking
for something new.

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:54.190
There were periods in
which I had that, and then

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:56.100
all of a sudden,
something would come up.

00:34:56.100 --> 00:35:00.630
Like when I discovered the music
and then developed a friendship

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:04.110
with the late great tango
master Astor Piazzola,

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:08.390
that was a pivotal
time in my career,

00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:12.330
because it really exemplified
the biggest change

00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:16.780
in my direction, my thinking,
and thought process,

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:24.800
and music-- connecting
intellectual with the heart.

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.680
What he was producing on his
own was very sentimental,

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:31.220
but at the same time,
very intellectual.

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:35.560
With fusion music, it
was going more cerebral,

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:39.990
but it wasn't so much
affecting the heart.

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:42.560
I saw that direction
going the wrong way.

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:46.960
And it made me
reconnect to the music

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:50.100
that I loved when I was a
kid that really did touch me.

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:53.340
And it could be something
as simple as the Beatles.

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:57.290
So the melodies were so
everlasting and beautiful.

00:35:57.290 --> 00:36:01.220
So I wanted to create
with that in mind

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:04.970
more often, so I let
that become an influence.

00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:07.200
So every often, you
look for something

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:09.630
like that to influence you.

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:11.420
Last record was a
tribute to the Beatles,

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:13.240
and then the new one
that's coming out

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:20.450
is a collection of all of
my influences up to 2015.

00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:22.310
So they're all original pieces.

00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:26.230
And it really shows
where I've come from,

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:28.220
and where I'm at
now, and what I've

00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:30.534
accumulated along the way
in terms of influence.

00:36:30.534 --> 00:36:31.950
BORIS DEBIC: I'm
kind of surprised

00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:35.880
that nobody has yet picked up
a large portion of their movie,

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:38.800
for example, used your music.

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.940
I thought that was
kind of strange.

00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:43.939
AL DI MEOLA: I'm only found in
The Sopranos for some reason.

00:36:43.939 --> 00:36:45.730
Something to do with
north Jersey, I think.

00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:47.940
BORIS DEBIC: Do we have
any audience questions?

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:49.440
AUDIENCE: More
toward the beginning,

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:52.910
you talked about
loving pop and working

00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:56.580
way up through Venture's
instrumental stuff to the pop.

00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:58.990
How do you make the
transition from that

00:36:58.990 --> 00:37:02.340
to being in Berkeley
and being proper jazz

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:06.600
and then coming out with this--
at the time, nobody did what

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:10.790
you did, which was playing
very fluidly-- rock-ish,

00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:14.170
but playing real jazz as
opposed to just plugging an art

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:16.350
shop into a fuzz box.

00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:20.480
AL DI MEOLA: My teacher from
the age of nine years old

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:24.790
was an old school jazz buff.

00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:28.620
So he was into Johnny Smith,
Tal Farlow, and Howard Roberts,

00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:31.330
and that kind of thing.

00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:37.910
And he taught me chord
positions, jazz chords, scales,

00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:40.190
alternate picking.

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:44.296
So I was already halfway there
by the time I got to Berkeley.

00:37:44.296 --> 00:37:45.670
In fact, more than
halfway there.

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:47.878
They wanted me to teach at
Berkeley when I got there,

00:37:47.878 --> 00:37:52.760
and I really wanted to
just continue my education.

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:56.970
But having the
experience of seeing

00:37:56.970 --> 00:38:00.560
all of my favorite
groups and absorbing

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:05.800
all the great Latin music of
New York, all those great clubs,

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:11.080
and then having that background
with the my jazz teacher

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:15.820
made me an oddball in a sense.

00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:21.950
Because I didn't fit into any
of the local-- around my town,

00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:25.110
they had a bunch of
local bands, and they

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:26.590
couldn't figure me out.

00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:29.790
Because that style
wasn't befitting of a lot

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:32.250
of that kind of rock music.

00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:37.640
So I was really on the
outside of that stuff

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:41.181
until after Berkeley, that
little short stint in Berkeley,

00:38:41.181 --> 00:38:42.930
and then I get this
call from Chick Corea,

00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:45.460
and all of a sudden,
I'm on the front page

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:48.380
of a lot of magazines.

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:52.834
With this style, it was at the
forefront of the fusion guitar.

00:38:52.834 --> 00:38:54.500
BORIS DEBIC: So we'll
do another number?

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:55.250
AL DI MEOLA: Yeah.

00:44:08.345 --> 00:44:10.341
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:15.702
BORIS DEBIC: Gumby Ortiz.

00:44:15.702 --> 00:44:16.634
My man.

00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:21.805
And Al Di Meola, of course.

00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:25.859
Good job, Al.

00:44:25.859 --> 00:44:27.400
AUDIENCE: I'm
curious-- you mentioned

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:28.680
being inspired by the Beatles.

00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:31.380
Yet the music that you
play and the musicians

00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:33.740
that you've played with are
heavily jazz influenced.

00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:36.640
And that's arguably, from
a technical standpoint,

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:40.600
incredibly complex, really
difficult music to play.

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:44.060
So reconciling those two
different influences--

00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:47.040
what do you think ultimately
makes a good musician?

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:50.440
Because arguably, the Beatles
weren't incredible guitarists,

00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:52.047
but they were great songwriters.

00:44:52.047 --> 00:44:53.880
And you've played with
incredible guitarists

00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:54.950
and incredible musicians.

00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:57.420
So I guess what do you
think makes a good musician?

00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:59.170
AL DI MEOLA: They told
stories with words.

00:44:59.170 --> 00:45:04.580
If you eliminate
the words, it feels

00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:07.840
like there's something
missing unless you do

00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:10.210
something really hip with it.

00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:17.270
So instrumental music
for me had to go beyond.

00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:22.820
We had to incorporate more
into the soup in order

00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:25.030
to make it more interesting.

00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:27.642
So if I had a
voice, I definitely

00:45:27.642 --> 00:45:28.600
wouldn't be doing this.

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:32.780
You get what I'm saying?

00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:34.520
Yeah.

00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:37.440
Plus, there were a lot
of different influences.

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:40.910
Beyond learning
the basics-- which

00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:45.020
you can have a great career
just with the basics, maybe even

00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:46.360
a better career.

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:50.144
There's a lot of pop bands
that don't know that much.

00:45:50.144 --> 00:45:51.810
They know maybe five,
six, seven chords,

00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:53.305
and they've written
tremendous hits

00:45:53.305 --> 00:45:55.700
that sold millions of records.

00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:59.250
But I got to a point
where-- especially

00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:02.270
when you think about the Beatles
when they stopped and they went

00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:04.180
off on their own
with John and Yoko,

00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:06.020
that was some bizarre stuff.

00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:07.610
I lost some interest.

00:46:07.610 --> 00:46:10.100
And I wasn't a big
Paul fan with Wings

00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:11.780
like other people
might have been.

00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:14.450
And I lost some interest.

00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:18.140
And I wanted to continue
learning the instrument,

00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:20.240
get more advanced on it.

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:24.540
And that's when my world
opened, and I heard Miles Davis.

00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:30.040
And Miles was really
the first jazz musician

00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:35.990
who comes from the post-pop
thing and then got into fusing

00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.490
the music.

00:46:36.490 --> 00:46:38.570
Because he became
so influenced by Sly

00:46:38.570 --> 00:46:41.530
and the Family
Stone, which I loved,

00:46:41.530 --> 00:46:43.580
and Jimi Hendrix and all.

00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:46.310
Even his clothes--
he was outrageous.

00:46:46.310 --> 00:46:48.470
He was totally into
the rock thing.

00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:53.580
So he came out with a record
called "Bitch's Brew."

00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:55.700
And all the guys
playing on that record--

00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:57.320
like Chick Core,
Joe Zawinul, who

00:46:57.320 --> 00:47:00.560
started Weather Report, John
McLaughlin, Mahavishnu, Billy

00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:04.550
Cobham-- they're all on
that record, Wayne Shorter.

00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:09.030
And they all went off to form
their own pioneering groups

00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:10.220
of that era.

00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:13.310
But it all started with that.

00:47:13.310 --> 00:47:14.760
And none of them can sing.

00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:20.520
BORIS DEBIC: Thank you, Al.

00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:25.260
You have a busy schedule
today, and we don't want

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:27.440
to mess up with your schedule.

00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:28.850
I want to thank you--

00:47:28.850 --> 00:47:29.490
AL DI MEOLA: This
was a pleasure.

00:47:29.490 --> 00:47:30.620
BORIS DEBIC: On behalf of
everybody here in this room.

00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:30.870
AL DI MEOLA: Thank you.

00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:31.720
It was a lot of fun.

00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:34.865
BORIS DEBIC: And all of the
people who will watch this.

00:47:34.865 --> 00:47:38.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:40.160
Let's give a standing
ovation, please.

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:41.170
Come on, guys.

00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:43.304
AL DI MEOLA: Thank
you very much.

00:47:43.304 --> 00:47:44.470
BORIS DEBIC: Take a bow, Al.

00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:45.560
Take a bow.

00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:48.310
[APPLAUSE]
