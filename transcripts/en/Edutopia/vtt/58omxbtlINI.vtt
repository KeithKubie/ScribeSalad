00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:12.726
&gt;&gt;Narrator: While most of her fellow
students are hitting the books

00:00:12.726 --> 00:00:16.956
at 10:00 A.M. Zoey McNealy is
pursuing gold medal dreams.

00:00:18.046 --> 00:00:21.976
She can do much of her school work
any time of the day or night thanks

00:00:22.036 --> 00:00:24.736
to the online offerings
of Virtual High School.

00:00:25.716 --> 00:00:28.236
&gt;&gt;Nancy: Zoey's been doing the VHS
classes since she was a freshman

00:00:28.386 --> 00:00:32.326
at Hudson High School, and
it really made the schedule

00:00:32.446 --> 00:00:38.746
for her skating much better because
the after-school skating ice is

00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:42.286
so much more crowded than the
daytime skating ice so it allowed her

00:00:42.286 --> 00:00:45.166
to leave school during the
day so that she could skate

00:00:45.686 --> 00:00:50.136
on an ice surface that didn't
have 20 children skating on it.

00:00:51.816 --> 00:00:57.246
&gt;&gt;Zoe: In tenth grade I took a
writing class and a Holocaust class.

00:00:58.416 --> 00:01:02.396
And then this year I
took Personal Finance

00:01:02.946 --> 00:01:05.946
and now I'm taking Honors
Environmental Science.

00:01:06.356 --> 00:01:10.636
So I can log on anywhere that has
Internet access so it allows me

00:01:10.686 --> 00:01:16.316
to either access the work at
competitions or I can access it

00:01:16.446 --> 00:01:18.746
when I come home and get
the work done that I missed

00:01:19.116 --> 00:01:20.976
without really missing anything.

00:01:21.046 --> 00:01:23.956
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Virtual High School
is a nonprofit collaborative

00:01:24.236 --> 00:01:29.386
of over 300 high schools in 26
states and 16 foreign countries

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:33.746
that offers more than 150 high
school courses over the Internet.

00:01:34.536 --> 00:01:37.836
Each participating school
contributes a course to the mix.

00:01:38.206 --> 00:01:40.756
&gt;&gt;Liz: They agree to free up
a teacher one period a day

00:01:40.756 --> 00:01:44.806
to teach a course online and VHS
provides the training services

00:01:44.806 --> 00:01:48.246
for that classroom teacher to learn
how to effectively teach online.

00:01:48.246 --> 00:01:50.786
&gt;&gt;I think a really critical element

00:01:50.786 --> 00:01:54.586
of a good online course is the
ability to build a community

00:01:54.586 --> 00:01:56.246
of learners in that course.

00:01:56.886 --> 00:01:59.786
We design our courses so
that the students are engaged

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:01.876
in online activities, they're engaged

00:02:01.936 --> 00:02:04.816
in online collaboration
through group projects.

00:02:05.426 --> 00:02:07.616
These students are
gaining the information

00:02:07.616 --> 00:02:11.486
and communication technology literacy
skills that they're going to need,

00:02:11.866 --> 00:02:15.466
not only to do well in high
school but to do well in college

00:02:15.506 --> 00:02:17.006
and to do well in the workforce.

00:02:18.066 --> 00:02:21.866
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Virtual High School
Cofounder Shelly Berman sees VHS

00:02:21.866 --> 00:02:25.396
as a way to take learning
to the next level.

00:02:25.836 --> 00:02:27.566
&gt;&gt;Shelly: We've had a
concept here that we wanted

00:02:27.566 --> 00:02:31.316
to provide opportunities for
students to take advanced courses,

00:02:31.366 --> 00:02:33.216
to take specialized courses,

00:02:33.256 --> 00:02:39.166
to try to accelerate their learning
whether they are having significant

00:02:39.166 --> 00:02:42.226
challenges in the classroom, or
whether they're very advanced

00:02:42.226 --> 00:02:45.016
and can move rapidly
through material.

00:02:45.736 --> 00:02:47.076
&gt;&gt;Zubin: This is almost
like a textbook.

00:02:47.076 --> 00:02:48.266
All of my controls are here.

00:02:49.066 --> 00:02:53.026
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For Zubin Patel VHS means
taking advanced computer science

00:02:53.056 --> 00:02:55.456
courses like cryptography at home.

00:02:56.076 --> 00:02:59.636
&gt;&gt;Zubin: The VHS basically
allows me to take these courses

00:02:59.636 --> 00:03:00.946
that aren't offered at school.

00:03:01.576 --> 00:03:02.426
It means extra work.

00:03:02.426 --> 00:03:05.556
It means staying up
some nights until 3:00

00:03:05.556 --> 00:03:10.276
in the morning doing
VHS work but you have

00:03:10.376 --> 00:03:12.946
to do what you have to do.

00:03:12.946 --> 00:03:15.156
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For special
needs student Katherine Hoar,

00:03:15.156 --> 00:03:17.366
VHS means learning how to learn.

00:03:18.306 --> 00:03:23.006
&gt;&gt;Katherine: I write slower than I
talk like I think about it faster

00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:24.296
in my head than I write it.

00:03:24.726 --> 00:03:29.936
On a computer I type faster than can-
I type fast so it gets all my ideas

00:03:29.936 --> 00:03:35.046
out faster that way
and I can spellcheck

00:03:35.196 --> 00:03:39.046
and make sure my punctuation
is correct and make sure

00:03:39.046 --> 00:03:42.766
that there isn't any
missed words in a sentence

00:03:43.196 --> 00:03:47.266
because I notice I
have a lot of that.

00:03:47.586 --> 00:03:51.756
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For Hudson's Music
Program Director, Jason Caron,

00:03:52.096 --> 00:03:54.366
VHS meant learning a
new way of teaching.

00:03:55.146 --> 00:03:59.626
He took the virtual school's 15-week
teacher training covering subjects

00:03:59.626 --> 00:04:04.876
like how to foster online discussions
before developing his own VHS course

00:04:05.156 --> 00:04:06.696
in American Popular Music.

00:04:07.366 --> 00:04:13.096
&gt;&gt;Jason: The students get two
compact discs with excerpts of music

00:04:13.266 --> 00:04:15.256
and they also get a videotape.

00:04:16.086 --> 00:04:20.536
Their job is to listen to that music
or watch the video, and then discuss

00:04:20.536 --> 00:04:23.816
with their online classmates what
they listened to and what they saw.

00:04:24.996 --> 00:04:27.506
The tone in our voice
doesn't get transmitted

00:04:27.506 --> 00:04:29.426
over the Internet connection.

00:04:29.426 --> 00:04:32.706
So you have to have to be very
careful with wording and really spell

00:04:32.706 --> 00:04:37.266
out your expectations and that's,
you know, the hindrance I guess

00:04:37.266 --> 00:04:40.386
of being disconnected from
the students physically.

00:04:40.926 --> 00:04:42.646
But a lot of it is
quite the same too.

00:04:42.696 --> 00:04:45.256
You build collaborative projects,

00:04:45.956 --> 00:04:50.076
you do a lot of community building
activities to try to find the sense

00:04:50.076 --> 00:04:52.966
of the class and the personality of
the individuals in the class too.

00:04:53.186 --> 00:04:56.306
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Yeah, you can click right
up here and just drag that title out.

00:04:56.796 --> 00:04:58.286
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The rigorous
teacher training

00:04:58.286 --> 00:05:01.226
and engaging course designs
seem to be paying off.

00:05:01.696 --> 00:05:07.296
The completion rate for VHS courses
is 90 percent, and the VHS pass rate

00:05:07.296 --> 00:05:10.426
for advanced placement
courses is 10 percent higher

00:05:10.426 --> 00:05:11.826
than the national average.

00:05:12.576 --> 00:05:16.866
But even Shelly Berman believes high
schools must maintain a balance.

00:05:18.006 --> 00:05:21.056
&gt;&gt;Shelly: I don't believe you can
have a completely virtual education.

00:05:21.836 --> 00:05:25.456
I don't think that we- it's
appropriate for students

00:05:25.456 --> 00:05:29.506
to have all their courses virtually
and I think the social environment

00:05:29.506 --> 00:05:30.986
of the high school is an
important environment.

00:05:31.696 --> 00:05:35.996
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For Zoey McNealy VHS
offers the best of both worlds.

00:05:37.506 --> 00:05:40.516
&gt;&gt;Zoe: It's almost what an actual
class would offer you except you're

00:05:40.516 --> 00:05:41.636
able to do it on your own.

00:05:42.816 --> 00:05:46.156
&gt;&gt;Nancy: The skating has opened up
a world for her that is incredible

00:05:46.566 --> 00:05:50.376
and without the VHS class I really
don't think we would have been able

00:05:50.456 --> 00:05:50.786
to do it.

00:05:51.346 --> 00:05:55.866
But I have come to the point where
even if she stopped skating today,

00:05:56.326 --> 00:05:58.366
I would continue having
her do those VHS classes.

00:05:58.366 --> 00:06:02.706
That's how much I really like
her being able to do that.
