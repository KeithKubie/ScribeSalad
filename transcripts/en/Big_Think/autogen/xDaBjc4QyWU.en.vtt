even they're very very important and
 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.839
even they're very very important and
significant jobs are precarious so you

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:04.849
significant jobs are precarious so you
 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:06.509
significant jobs are precarious so you
want to get out of the zone of

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519

precariousness and part of how you get
out of that precariousness is savings

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280
out of that precariousness is savings
 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.120
out of that precariousness is savings
and then over time the next layer of

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130
and then over time the next layer of
 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.039
and then over time the next layer of
financial independence is is you start

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049
financial independence is is you start
 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.759

to see that surplus savings can be
invested in such a way that it throws

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169
invested in such a way that it throws
 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.659
invested in such a way that it throws
off an income and over time if you
