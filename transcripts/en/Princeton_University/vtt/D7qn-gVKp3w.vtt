00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:35.990
 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.960
SHIRLEY M. TILGHMAN: It is a
pleasure for me to be here in

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.080
Shanghai to engage in this
conversation that was really

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.480
inspired by William Fung, who
is a member of the class of

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.330
1970 at Princeton, and currently
a trustee at the

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.720
university.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.090
I think he described brilliantly
the rationale for

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.480
these conferences that we hope
to have in cities around the

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.880
world in the years to come.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.230
It's really intended to
spark conversation.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.830
So we hope that this will be the
beginning of a wonderful

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.790
series of conversations in which
Princeton engages with

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.090
some of the most important
questions facing our world.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:27.360
 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.260
EDWARD GLAESER: Now the success
the dynamism, the

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.140
significance of cities
throughout the world today is

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.040
something of a paradox, because
we live in an age in

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.420
which distance is dead,
in which we could all

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.780
effortlessly telecommuting in
from whatever sylvan spot

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.750
appeals to our biophilia.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.540
And yet, in so many ways, in so
many places, we choose the

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.640
inconveniences of city life.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.090
The cyber-seers and the
techno-prophets in the 1980s

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.350
predicted that the internet
would all make us revert back

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.740
to electronic cottages.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.020
And yet, the opposite seems
to have happened,

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.180
and that's a paradox.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.550
Why has the ability to
communicate and connect over

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.220
long distances actually
made proximity

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.930
more, not less, valuable?

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.130
Why hasn't it meet face-to-face
contact that

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.420
cities enable more, not
less, valuable?

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.820
Now this rosy view of cities
was very different from the

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:12.895
New York of my youth.

00:02:12.895 --> 00:02:16.280
This is an image of Detroit from
1967, the year which I

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.340
was born, in which the city
was in flames, in which it

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.440
appeared that civilization
itself, a creation of a city,

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.470
had fled to greener pastures.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.610
This reflected the decline in
transportation cost during an

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.810
earlier era, the move of
industry from older urban

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.190
areas to suburban areas, to
lower cost states within the

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.120
US, and then to lower cost areas
throughout the country.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.040
We have seen the process of
industrial cities hollowing

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.730
out throughout the globe.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.110
And indeed, this is something
that China will eventually

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.360
also have to face.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:55.680
 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.080
JUAN DU: What I want to point
out to you, and since this

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.270
panel is talking about planning
in some ways, the

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.290
actual population in
1979 was 300,000.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.870
And the master plan that was
created at the time by the

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.120
central government, and by the
Tianjin civil government,

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.450
planned a population
for one million.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.940
That means all of the roads,
all of the facilities--

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.740
hospitals, housing,
et cetera--

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.820
was forming for one million.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.880
But actually, by the year 2000,
the actual population of

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.970
Tianjin was 10 million.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.740
So 10 times the demand
on all civic

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.430
infrastructure and civic services.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.880
 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.930
This is a map published in
Tianjin officially by

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.320
government, and it's the central
economic zone in the

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.260
year 2000, because this is the
City Hall, which is a giant

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.035
building that covers
a huge city block.

00:03:52.035 --> 00:03:53.730
I want to draw your
attention to this.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.310
This is right off the
axis of the symmetry

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.860
of the central CBD.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.510
This looks like a typical
luxury housing

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.040
development in the city.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.930
However, this is the
actual condition.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.310
So this map was published
in the year 2007.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.050
This satellite photo
was the year 2010.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.140
So 10 years difference between
what was planned and reviewed

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.904
as the actual versus
what is the real.

00:04:19.904 --> 00:04:21.154
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:04:21.154 --> 00:04:57.400
 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:05.200
GYAN PRAKASH: So we are back
to the soft city--

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.200
the soft city of myths,
dreams, illusions,

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.892
imaginations, dreams,
nightmares.

00:05:12.892 --> 00:05:15.352
We're talking about cinema.

00:05:15.352 --> 00:05:19.800
And cinematic expression has profoundly
shaped our

00:05:19.886 --> 00:05:22.190
visions of urban life.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.240
A new generation of film makers
have emerged to provide

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.500
fresh depictions and reflections
on the city.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.170
ANDREW JARECKI: I found, at
least in my experience, that

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:38.810
the city can be an extremely
important character in a film.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:44.145
Certainly, anybody that's seen
a film made in India knows

00:05:44.145 --> 00:05:48.138
that it's almost the only thing
that an American can

00:05:48.138 --> 00:05:52.420
think of when you watch a
film, whether it's like

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.820
popular, like Slumdog
Millionaire, or something more

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:56.710
sophisticated.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.900
And certainly, for me, New York
City has been like that,

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.990
because I grew up in New York,
and I was raised there, and I

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.970
had all my summer jobs when
I was a kid walking

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:07.940
around Times Square.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:14.130
And so, I started writing this
screenplay for this film

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.140
called All Good Things, and
always had New York City in my

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:22.980
mind, having a particular focus
on the center of the

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.435
city, which I think of
as Times Square.

00:06:25.435 --> 00:06:26.370
ANURAG KASHYAP: So my
first experience

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:27.620
with a city was quite--

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.205
 

00:06:30.205 --> 00:06:36.040
when I moved to Bombay to get
into the movies, I was kind of

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.132
very awed by the city, which I
think is quite visible in my

00:06:39.132 --> 00:06:41.118
first film.

00:06:41.118 --> 00:06:46.150
So for me, a city was always this
strange creature, because I

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.345
never saw those tall buildings
I never grew up with them.

00:06:49.345 --> 00:06:56.480
 

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.640
MICHAEL OPPENHEIMER: One of the
things we know with great

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.050
certainty is we have increased
exposure along the coast, we

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.560
have put more infrastructure
and people in vulnerable

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.765
situations, and that over time,
we expect that exposure

00:07:10.765 --> 00:07:12.575
to even grow more and more.

00:07:12.575 --> 00:07:18.540
And as a result, quantifiable
damages, monetizable damages--

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.930
from tropical cyclones,
for instance--

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:24.553
have increased, and it's
not yet due to

00:07:24.553 --> 00:07:25.610
any big climate change.

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.340
It's not due yet, we believe,
due to an overall change in

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:29.440
vulnerability.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.880
It's the business of letting
more and more people settle in

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.920
vulnerable situations
where they are

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.170
exposed to these hazards.

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.040
So there, again, the
combination.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:45.310
Risk is from the concatenation
of vulnerability and exposure

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:48.710
with the physical changes
in the climate system.

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:51.730
A storm not as bad as Sandy at
the flood level, instead of

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:56.540
11.3 feet, was about 9 feet--
you can convert

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:59.370
it to meters yourself--

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:00.530
happened in 1992.

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:03.130
It was a hundred-year storm
instead of a thousand-year.

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:05.920
This is the Hoboken, New
Jersey-- right across from the

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:06.600
river from New York City--

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.350
subway station that
got flooded.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:11.130
A friend of mine was in the
station at the time.

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:12.510
He didn't take this picture.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:14.910
But he literally ran
for his life.

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:18.710
He almost drowned, and after
that, the city got very

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:21.630
concerned about plugging the
tunnels, keeping the water out

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:24.160
of subways, raising the
ventilations gratings,

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.820
plugging the highway tunnels.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.915
And then slowly over the years,
the energy just drifted

00:08:28.915 --> 00:08:30.165
out of the system.

00:08:30.165 --> 00:08:37.230
 

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:39.869
DENISE MAUZERALL: This is
photographs taken in Beijing a

00:08:39.869 --> 00:08:41.080
couple of weeks ago.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.619
And it's quite a common sight.

00:08:43.619 --> 00:08:45.330
To see people with
masks like this.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.140
This is not that common sight.

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:50.400
But the visibility is
enormously impaired.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.230
With Professor Zhu Tong, I
took the fast train to Beijing

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:58.830
to Shanghai on Tuesday when the
measured PM 2.5 was about

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.920
500 micrograms per
cubic meter.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.750
And across the entire region,
the visibility

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:05.970
was enormously impaired.

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:09.090
There were times frequently
during that trip where we

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:11.720
couldn't see 50 feet
outside the window.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.185
In the year 200, about half
a million people died

00:09:14.185 --> 00:09:17.990
prematurely from their
exposure to aerosols.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:21.200
If business as usual continued,
about three

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.376
quarters of a million would.

00:09:23.376 --> 00:09:26.380
If the current legislation was
perfectly enforced, you'd

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.100
return in 2030 to the
levels of 2000.

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:40.450
CHRISTOPHER L. EISGRUBER: It's
been an extraordinary

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:43.847
privilege to be a part
of this conference.

00:09:43.847 --> 00:09:48.950
And I know from the
conversations with all of you

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.540
that this conference has
launched a set of

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:55.745
relationships and dialogues that
will persist long beyond

00:09:55.745 --> 00:10:00.195
it across fields, as well
as across oceans and

00:10:00.195 --> 00:10:01.240
international boundaries.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:06.815
I want to, in my returning to
Mario Small's question that I

00:10:06.815 --> 00:10:10.440
declined to even try to answer
earlier about how we can have

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:14.770
conversations about the right
level of both complexity,

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:18.820
given the problems that we're
facing, and interdisciplinary.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:21.740
Only to link that up to kind
of a paradox that has

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.380
resonated through this
conference, which is that in

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:29.060
an age when virtual
communication has become more

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:33.780
possible, and, when in theory,
we could all interact with one

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:36.350
another without being
in proximity.

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:39.970
The city has become more
important in place.

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:41.200
It's become more important.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.720
That seems to be true of these
conversations, as well as this

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:45.876
conference exemplifies.

00:10:45.876 --> 00:10:48.167
So that one of the
responsibilities we have as we

00:10:48.167 --> 00:10:50.835
move forward with these problems
is to continue to

00:10:50.835 --> 00:10:54.070
look forward, to look for
innovative ways to bring

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:57.200
people together to have these
kinds of conversations that

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.780
would not otherwise
take place.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:01.660
I thank all of you for making
these conversations such an

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:03.670
extraordinary success.

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:05.980
And I think you should give
yourself, as well my fellow

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.944
panelists, a round of applause
to finish that.

00:11:08.944 --> 00:11:14.200
[APPLAUSE]
