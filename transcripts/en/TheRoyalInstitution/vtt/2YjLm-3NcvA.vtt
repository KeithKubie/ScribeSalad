00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.469
Fireflies have a very nice example here

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:11.210
where the female firefly does not fly but
sits on a tree in the jungle.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.570
And watches the sky and the male flies along
flashing a winking light,

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.600
at a rate that is characteristic for that
species.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.000
When the female sees the right rate flying
overhead then she winks back.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.519
He recognises this and flies down to her.

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:32.009
It's a beautiful way of bringing two very
small animals together

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.760
in a large tract of countryside.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.800
There's the male.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.820
Started flashing as he flew off.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.280
You see the luminescent organ is at the back
of his abdomen.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.360
Flashing a characteristic message, rather
like Morse code.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.100
And here is a female answering back.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.720
And in a moment we'll see them side by side.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.140
There they are.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.100
They've met up and they're still flashing
away in a courtship signal.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.700
Now it's been found that if you do this very
carefully,

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.659
you can use a small torch to pretend that
you're a female firefly

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.359
and call a male down.

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:24.259
The male has come down to the experimenter's
hand there.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.680
Every time it flashes he waits for a moment
and then flashes back.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.240
The firefly came over to the torch.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.000
And now he moved the torch and called it back.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.439
There can be a nasty end to that story though.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.920
Because the female fireflies of some species
are very carnivorous.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.400
And they wink at males of other species.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.500
So the male flies down thinking he's found
himself a girlfriend

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.980
to find he gets gobbled up.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.100
It's really not nice.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.340
The way in which these animals make their
light is extremely interesting.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.859
Because they do it by a chemical process,
mixing two chemicals together

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:11.489
which then produces a very great deal of light.

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:17.310
I have here two such chemicals that when mixed
will produce light.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.990
I've always wanted to do this demonstration
and now's my chance.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.520
I'll pour them now into this funnel and just
watch what happens.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.240
Isn't that beautiful?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And it continues to glow in the big reservoir
down here.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.580
Now if I take the funnel, it's still quite
cold.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.459
We're used to thinking of light sources as
having to be hot.

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.120
But this chemical reaction produces very little
heat.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.360
All the energy of the reaction goes into the
production of light.
