00:00:00.216 --> 00:00:01.806
&gt;&gt;Turner: All right,
June, let's get a hug.

00:00:01.926 --> 00:00:05.826
&gt;&gt;Cantor: The driver for
learning is the social connection.

00:00:06.536 --> 00:00:10.516
Activating a child's
cognitive skills begins

00:00:10.516 --> 00:00:13.376
with activating their
social connectedness.

00:00:17.636 --> 00:00:23.226
&gt;&gt;Children in this school are starting
the day with an adult saying to them,

00:00:23.226 --> 00:00:29.486
"I see you, I know you, I'm connecting
with you, and you're important to me."

00:00:29.486 --> 00:00:32.106
&gt;&gt;Turner: We start each day by
greeting every kid at the door.

00:00:32.106 --> 00:00:33.006
&gt;&gt;Good morning, Douglas.

00:00:33.006 --> 00:00:37.136
&gt;&gt;Douglas: You look pretty, Miss Turner!
&gt;&gt;Turner: Thank you, baby.

00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:43.506
&gt;&gt;Every classroom does
some variation of would you

00:00:43.506 --> 00:00:45.406
like a high-five, handshake, or hug?

00:00:45.606 --> 00:00:48.246
Essentially, it's "What
greeting would you like?"

00:00:48.246 --> 00:00:49.836
&gt;&gt;Turner: Ho you doing, handsome?
&gt;&gt;Child: Good.

00:00:49.976 --> 00:00:54.206
&gt;&gt;Cantor: There is a great deal of
cultural sensitivity and empowerment

00:00:54.206 --> 00:00:58.326
for children to say, "Here
is how I want to greet you."

00:00:58.596 --> 00:01:01.896
&gt;&gt;Turner: High-five, handshake or hug?
You got your hair done?

00:01:01.896 --> 00:01:02.266
&gt;&gt;Molly: Hug.

00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:04.046
&gt;&gt;Turner: Good morning,
Molly. You got your hair done?

00:01:04.046 --> 00:01:05.146
Let me see, turn around.

00:01:05.146 --> 00:01:08.866
I love it. All right, we gonna
have a good day today? All right.

00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:10.766
&gt;&gt;High-give, handshake or hug?

00:01:12.396 --> 00:01:14.606
&gt;&gt;During that time, I'm just
trying to connect with them,

00:01:15.336 --> 00:01:18.886
help them from their transition from
home to school and just kind of--

00:01:18.886 --> 00:01:20.516
it's like a pulse check
to see where they are.

00:01:20.796 --> 00:01:24.666
&gt;&gt;Oh! I knew you wanted a hug.
Arrrgh! How you feeling today, sir?

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:25.746
&gt;&gt;Child: Good.

00:01:25.746 --> 00:01:27.546
&gt;&gt;Turner: Are we going to have
a good day? Look in my eyes.

00:01:27.546 --> 00:01:30.346
&gt;&gt;Do they look escalated, do they
look triggered, do they look upset?

00:01:30.346 --> 00:01:34.286
So, this is a way for me to see, okay,
who needs to be where, how can I help,

00:01:34.286 --> 00:01:37.356
how can I be of assistance to start
their day off most effectively?

00:01:38.126 --> 00:01:40.506
&gt;&gt;Turner: Good morning,
Ariella! How you doing today?

00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:43.826
&gt;&gt;I'm being very intentional about
my interactions with students, right?

00:01:43.826 --> 00:01:46.896
So, it's not just I'm in the
back of the room, "Hey, come in."

00:01:47.036 --> 00:01:48.536
No, I'm making connection with them.

00:01:48.536 --> 00:01:50.376
I'm-- have eye contact with them.

00:01:50.706 --> 00:01:53.306
I'm checking in on how they're doing,
I'm checking to make sure they're okay.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.500
&gt;&gt;Good morning, friends.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.456
&gt;&gt;Children: Good morning, friends.

00:01:56.456 --> 00:02:00.206
&gt;&gt;Turner: I think the impact
is deep relationships.

00:02:00.336 --> 00:02:02.916
I get to know my students,
I get to check in with them.

00:02:02.916 --> 00:02:05.826
I get to find out something about them,
they get to find out something about me.

00:02:06.256 --> 00:02:09.966
We get to make a connection and that
starts with the greeting at the door.

00:02:10.436 --> 00:02:11.226
&gt;&gt;All right, come on in.

00:02:11.776 --> 00:02:16.926
&gt;&gt;Cantor: So, a child is walking in
the door feeling cared for, empowered

00:02:16.926 --> 00:02:22.626
and encouraged, and that teacher is
focusing in on who that child is,

00:02:22.796 --> 00:02:24.156
and that's how the day starts.
