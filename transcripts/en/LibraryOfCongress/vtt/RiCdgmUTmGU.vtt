&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:11.390
[ Applause ]

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:12.690
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
Good evening everyone.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.990
I'm Roswell Encina.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.020
I'm the Chief Communications
Officer for the Library of Congress

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.400
and I want to welcome you all to
the Library of Congress tonight,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.560
for our very first LC Halloween.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.410
So, if you haven't seen
our new popup exhibit,

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.850
it's really spooky and amazing.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.360
So, it shows the Library's
Houdini collection.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.330
We have a day of the
dead collection.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.380
And all these other
ghoulish ghost stories.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.330
We'd love you to come back
tomorrow and look at it.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.990
Um, we started this pop-up, um,

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.520
series earlier this year during
the Inauguration that we graduated

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.490
to a Pride exhibit to
an awesome Con exhibit

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.340
where we feature the Library's
largest comic book collection.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.390
And we decided, you know,
who doesn't love Halloween?

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.190
So, we decided to do this
marvelous exhibit upstairs.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.160
So, it goes until November 1st.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.630
So, we're hoping that you
come back to the Library.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.350
Bring your friends, you
know, it's the best way

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.580
to celebrate Halloween
this year at the Library.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.020
Also, if you have nothing
going on tomorrow afternoon,

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.920
please come back we're
showing 'Hocus Pocus'.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.510
It doesn't scream Halloween
more without 'Hocus Pocus'.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.310
So, we would love you to come back.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.540 position:56%
And there are other great events
coming up to the Library of Congress

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.550
in the next couple of weeks.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.790
We have Christopher
Nolan here next week.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.600 position:56%
He's discussing his film making
process from 'Dunkirk' to 'Memento',

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.770
so we're looking forward to that.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.910
And, a long list of other great
programs coming to the Library.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.010
So, please go to loc.gov for
a long list of these programs.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.380
And, these programs
would not be possible

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.940
without our generous sponsors, so
if you enjoy these free events,

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.260
we encourage you to
go to loc.gov/donate.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.310
I know why you're all here
tonight, you're not hear to listen

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.610
to me talk about, you know,

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.280
our housekeeping stuff
here at the Library.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.640
So, let's get to it.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.890
In 1999 the most successful
independent film was released

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.190
to America.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.100
We all thought it was
real, we all got scared.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.590 position:56%
It was made with only $60,000 and
it generated more than $250 million.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.140
So, we're very lucky and very
fortunate tonight to have some

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.720
of the film makers part of
the 'Blair Witch Project'.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.290
So, please welcome Eduardo
Sanchez the co-director,

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.920
Mike Monello the co-producer, and
Julia Myrick-- I love her title--

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.560
she's history fabricator.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.510
Please welcome them here to the
Library of Congress tonight.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:33.070
[ Applause ]

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.370
Welcome.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.670
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: Thank you.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.450 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: I can't believe
it's been almost 20 years and I have

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.090
to be honest, when this movie
first came out it shared,

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.990
it scared the, out of me.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.520
I mean. Last time I
saw it was in 1999.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.710
I had to re-watch, I re-watched
it today and I have to be honest,

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.810
I was a little scared
to watch it again.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.690
Because the first time I
watched it, I couldn't, you know,

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.520
sleep for the next couple of days.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.940
So, I'm a little nervous
what's going to happen

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.460
to me when I go back tonight.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.700
Um, did you ever imagine
you'd be talking

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.860
about this film 20 years later?

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.290
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez:
No, absolutely not.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.130
I mean, you know, when we did it, I
mean we knew we had something cool

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.180
and we knew that, you know,
everybody we pitched it to was,

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.160
you know, got excited and, and it
seemed like it was our best idea.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.820
But, no, I'm we just hoped for,
you know, a little video deal maybe

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.490
and just enough money
for the next film.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.330
So, and then once it blew up it
was kind of, like Mike and I would,

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.240
you know, we'd always, you
know, we shared an office

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.630
and we would just come in every
day, like a different thing.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:30.930
Like what?

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.230
Did you see this?

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.840
I remember when he came in and
brought the cover of Time Magazine,

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.890
it was just like, it looked like
one of those Time Magazine's you do

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.180
at like Ocean City, you put
yourself in the [laughter].

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.730
You know, I was like, so yeah, I
mean it was a complete surprise.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.240
And, and, also just the fact
that people are still talking

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.170
about it is just amazing.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.670
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: You know, um,
where did this idea come from?

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.030
I always wondered like, was it
based on some other folk lore?

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.390
Did you just make this
whole witch legend up?

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.000
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez: Yeah, I mean,
the whole thing was that we wanted

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.160
to make this ah, you know, this ah,
fictional, ah, mythology of just,

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.040
ah, something in the woods.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.350 position:56%
We didn't know what it was at first.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.580
We thought that maybe it was
something evil and eventually,

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.110
we were like, well it
kind of had to be a witch,

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.410
that's really the only kind
of thing that, you know,

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.150
from the Salem Witch
Trials, we tried to kind

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.450
of connect those kinds of things.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.470
And then we let, just kind of
this, this, the support team,

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.270
kind of build the mythology
and they went to work

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.690
and Juliette can tell
you more about that.

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.980
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: Um, well, I
mean I think that you find is,

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.990
is the you had Dan
and Ed who was like,

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.900
ok here's our major points, right.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.100
Something happens every 50
years was I think the thing

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.400
that you came up with.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.700
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez: Yeah.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.910
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: We know
that this, in 1780 and 1820

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.910
and I can't even remember
the dates, it's been so long.

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.250
And then Ben came in, myself
and Christian Gueverra,

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.110
we were the three kind
of history fabricators.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.780
Ben really loved the Blair Witch.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.550
He's a super horror maven and
I think one of the lucky things

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.620
through the process was, when you
love ghost stories you tell ghost

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:10.920
stories the right way.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.640
And then you're like
ok and then bring

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.450
in some other people I
need this flushed out.

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.540 position:56%
The audience was asking for answers.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.790
And so, then you bring up, well how
would I find the answer to this?

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.230
Let me go look up in a history book
and let me say what I want to say

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.090
to you based on what I would've
found in a history book.

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:27.390
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Roger Ebert,

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.190
his review was "This
movie was ingenious".

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.490
And I think it was.

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.280
I think like everyone else here,
we all thought it was real.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.110
There were posters going up
that these hikers were missing.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.360
So, I walked in and left that
movie thinking, "Oh my gosh,

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.790
two hours down the road, this, you
know, these hikers are missing,

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.450
and I could be the next victim."

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.370
Um, was this intentional, that
you wanted to make it feel

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.710
like it, if it was a real thing?

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.010
&gt;&gt;Julia Myrick: Well I mean
I think that's what you get

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.310
with Bloody Mary, right.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.610
I mean even when you're
six years old,

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.830
you're like Bloody Mary
is really in the mirror,

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.130
Bloody Mary is really
going to kill you.

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.180
You never, you never tell another
six-year-old it's all not a

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.540
real story.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.060
This is playing on your fears,
if you put this on the mirror

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.800
and in your head, you
imagine it, you're never going

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.100
to tell a story that way.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.240 position:56%
So, you want people to be terrified.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.830
You want them to believe
this is true.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.900
So, of course you're like,
"This really happened".

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.340
And the first time I heard about
it, um, IndieWire had come out,

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.310
they hadn't even shot a
single piece of footage yet,

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.850
and Ed and Dan had come
up with this videotape

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:31.260
and it said this is a history
of the Township of Blair.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.620
And there was this zucchini
festival and they had.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.050
They were trying to raise money.

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.240
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez: Yeah, it
was like our investor take,

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.240
which kind of laid out the story,
a little bit of the history

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.310
and then what happened
to the three film makers.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.470
And, you know, that Haxan Films,
which is the company that we have,

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.320
when we had at the time, um,
was, was, got the footage,

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.620
the rights to the footage.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.000
And now we're editing it together,
so, yeah, it was, [inaudible] was

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.620
like trying to kind of
recapture like the fear that Dan

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:03.160
and I had while watching like
'In Search Of' or like any kind

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.290
of pseudo-documentary like
"Legend of Boggy Creek".

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:10.420
Um, even "Chair of the Gods", like
there's these, these films that,

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:14.580
you know, just the idea that
it could be real for us, was,

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:18.650
was kind of the thing that, that
kind of fueled us to come to figure

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:21.300
out what, you know, the
whole 'Blair Witch' thing.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.080 position:56%
But yeah, we wanted it to feel real.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:27.110
We wanted nothing in the
movie to, to like, um,

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:28.900
to give up the fact
that it was not real.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.900
Like we didn't want any,
like crazy special effects,

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.090
or crazy lighting or
anything like that.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.130
We wanted it to be
like, totally 100% real.

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:40.390
&gt;&gt; Mike Monello: Yeah, you
know, to your question,

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:42.510
there was definitely
not an intension

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:46.530
to make people think it was
truly real and I think the fact

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:50.270
that it's very easy to shoot,
to prove that there no Township

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.070
of Blair, [chuckles] Maryland.

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:54.570
So, there are clearly
fictional elements

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:56.220
that you would not have
done if you were trying

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:59.530
to actually create a
hoax, in that sense.

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:04.320 position:56%
I think it was, it was definitely
more like, let's, let's, let's talk,

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.620
let's talk to the audience.

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.070
Let's tell this story
in a very realistic way.

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:12.480
And, and, that goes to when the
footage came back from the shoot

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.190
and Ed and Dan started
assembling it, you know.

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:17.810
I remember Ed was very
much like "I'm just.

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:19.110
We're just."

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:20.410
The plan was just for them,

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:23.250
these guys to cut an
assembly of the footage.

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:27.090
And, and just keep everything
that felt authentic and real.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:29.270
And get rid of anything
that felt fake.

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:31.470
Any lines of dialogue
that didn't work.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:34.360
So, the first assembly of the film
which was I don't know, how long?

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.970
It was just, was, was,
not an assembly to try

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:40.340
to create a narrative or
anything, it was just,

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:43.020
let's just take what's
good and what's real

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:44.680
and then we'll work from there.

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.980
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
I think what made it

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.100
so effective was the
sound footage technique.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:49.720
I mean it's not the first
time it's ever been use,

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.320
but I think 'Blair Witch'
really made it very popular.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.790
Like, I mean years
later, "Cloverfield"

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:57.490
and "Paranormal Activity"
used the same thing.

00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:00.550
But, it just didn't have
the same kind of oomph,

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:02.400
like what the 'Blair Witch' did.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.750
As I know, I thought it was real.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:06.280
I thought it was actually
like a documentary.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:10.770
But think using that technique
and not have to be, like, honest,

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:15.340
marketing of the film really helped
it, catapult it to where it is.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.520
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: Well, and I think
there's, what's interesting is,

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:21.280 position:56%
I think there's a lot of chances and
I think this is true of every film,

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.200
for it to all go terribly wrong.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.650
And, and from the very
beginning it was supposed

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:29.730
to a little bit more fictional
in feel, you were going to,

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:31.820
what became the 'Curse
of the Blair Witch'.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.690
We're like, ok, we're
going to shoot this,

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:36.890
kind of narrative documentary
sort of stuff, oh here's this part

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:38.680
of the story, and now we're
going to go to found footage,

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.020
here's the story, now we're
going to go to the found footage.

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:42.520
And then through the process.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.820
And it was a year, wasn't it?

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:45.120
Of editing?

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.420
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez: Yeah,
it was, yeah, it was like.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:47.720
Yeah, nine months.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.020
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: It was like
a year of editing and it kept

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.380
on coming back it's less
entertaining, it's less emotional,

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:54.400
it's less scary, whenever
we bring in more things.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.530
And there was a big debate about
it and we had outsiders come in

00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:00.110 position:56%
and look at it, other people who had
really good taste, and you're like,

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:02.120
I think you're just going to
have this, play it straight.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.990
Because it's much more
compelling, it's much scarier,

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:09.190
and the fact that you're
not really sure, like,

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:15.150
once it feels more jazzed up,
more formal, you're like ok now,

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:17.000
I've been removed from the story.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.960
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez: Yeah, it's
harder to believe, you know.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.200
Like, yeah, because,
because the original idea

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.380
for the movie was going to
be a straight up documentary

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:27.850
about examining the footage
of these three filmmakers

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:29.150
in the woods and then.

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:30.450
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: It was
going to be more like 'Curse

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:31.750
of the Blair Witch' ended up.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:34.620 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez: Yeah, I mean, it
really was like an in-search episode

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.640 position:56%
or documentary about this, you know.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.460
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: The decision
to make it what it is now?

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.720
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: Probably towards
the end of that year of editing.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.020
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.320
&gt;&gt; Mike Monello: It was a process.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.620
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez:
Well we realized.

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:46.920
Realized.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.220
&gt;&gt; Mike Monello: This
slow realization.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:49.520 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez: We realized that
the documentary stuff was getting

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:50.820
in the way of the footage you know.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.510
And every time we came out, we
got out, came away from the kids,

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:57.710
you know, the people in the
woods, not that it wasn't boring,

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:00.270
it was boring, but it kind
of like pulled the tension

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:01.570
out of the movie, you know.

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:04.440
So, we were like, let's
just play the whole thing

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.910
and just see what happens you know.

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:08.040
&gt;&gt; Mike Monello: What I think to
your point about 'Cloverfield'

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.160
and 'Paranormal Activity', I think
that one thing that's interesting,

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.690
and I, you know, when, when
we got invited to do this,

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:18.580 position:56%
I kind of thought "Oh I should" --
my kids hadn't seen anything related

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:19.980
to Blair Witch before this--
and so I thought "Well,

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:21.400
I'll show them the Cure
of the Blair Witch".

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:25.130
And I hadn't seen it since,
since we made it and um,

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:29.470
as I was watching it I thought this
is deeply weird for TV even today.

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:31.340
[Laughter] Class of 1999.

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:34.730
And I remember thinking it
was much more traditional

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:36.440
in documentary style,
but really, like,

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.000
it starts off with no explanation
and just kind of dives in.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.300
And the film does that too.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:45.140
And I think the difference is
that, you know, as Ed was saying,

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:48.880
the film as it exists now was
not intended to exist that way.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:53.110
So, the found footage can, wasn't
meant to carry the entire film.

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:57.370
And I think something happens
where it feels, it feels very real

00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:01.530
because it's not, it doesn't
work like a standard narrative

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:04.770
versus like, those other
movies where they're thinking

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:07.000 position:56%
of the entire film as found footage.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.700
So, they're feeling much closer
to a traditional narrative art.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:14.040
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Now, the three
major players here are the actors.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:18.490 position:56%
Um, when I was watching it the first
time and when I re-watched it, um,

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:19.870
watching it the first time
I thought it was real.

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:22.000
So, now at least I
know it isn't clearly.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.460
Um, did they play a key role,
was it, which was improved,

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:28.040
did you have to teach
them how to use a camera?

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:31.060
Which, were they really
operating the camera?

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:32.360
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez: Yeah,

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.660
we had like a little
mini film camp for them.

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:35.480
Like a little film school.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.820
Um, where we kind of showed them.

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:41.180
We're using a Hi8 video camera,
which is basically slap the tape

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:43.970
in and, you know, go,
and start taping.

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:48.330
We had to tell Heather, after the
first day of shooting, like zoom,

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.700
make sure you zoom out,
because she was walking

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:54.550
around with the camera zoomed
in and it was even shakier

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:57.490
than [chuckles] ah,
than the movie ended up.

00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:58.790
It was just too much.

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:01.040
So, there was like little things
like that that we had to tell them.

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:06.640
And then we were using a CP16 film
camera, and we kind of taught Josh,

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.330
who was supposed to be the camera
man, a little bit about that.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.160
About how to you know,
run it and stuff.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:15.540
But, um, yeah, you know, they were,
they were actors and you know,

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.990 position:56%
so we had to kind of train them,
not only on you know, the equipment,

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:20.980
but also on mythology, like.

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:23.850
You know Heather was supposed to
be an expert on the Blair Witch.

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:28.180
So, the mythology that we had built
we basically gave it to her to, to,

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:30.820
you know, exploit throughout
the movie, to just bring it up.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:33.220
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: How was the
process of casting the actors?

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:36.150
I mean you had to pick completely
unknowns, there's not, you know,

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:39.110 position:56%
you couldn't hire Gwyneth Paltrow,
you know, or your Brad Pitt to play.

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:40.420
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez: No,
it wouldn't have worked.

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:41.720
&gt;&gt; Mike Monello: It couldn't,
no couldn't have cast it.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.020
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: And we didn't
have the money [laughter].

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.320
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez: No
that wouldn't have worked.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.620
&gt;&gt; Mike Monello: For
a lot of reasons.

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:46.920
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez: Yeah.

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.010
No, we just, we went
to New York mostly.

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:51.250
We auditioned here,
we auditioned in L.A.,

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:53.690
we auditioned in Orlando,
where we were based.

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:58.140
But um, New York, you know, the
New York talent is where like the,

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:01.450
just the unsinged talent
is, that's where,

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:03.990
where really, where
it's concentrated.

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:06.290
So, we auditioned about
1,000 people.

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:09.490
Um, and we were just looking for
like really, like good people.

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:12.800
People who could really improve
well and like really feel like,

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:15.520
like you were really, like they
were a, like they were real.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:16.820
You know, that's whole thing.

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:19.330
Just do these people sound
like they're saying lines?

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.460
Or are they really just talking?

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:23.680
And we didn't write any dialogue
in the movie, in the script.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:25.280
So, we know it was
going to be improvised.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:27.240
So, we just picked the right
actors really, you know.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.730
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: And the best
part of the story was, you know,

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:33.790
they immediately walked
into a fictional moment.

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:36.270
So, you, they, Heather
walked into the,

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:38.550
I think it was the prison
guard thing, so that she went

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:42.710
into the elevator it said "This
is the-" what panel was it?

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:44.010
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez: Oh.

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:45.490
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: It
was like if you're, oh!

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:46.790
"Parole, Probation Board".

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:48.090
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez: Oh,
right, right, right.

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:49.430
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: They go in and
they're like "Why should you?

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:51.080
You committed this murder.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.030
You've shown no remorse.

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:55.930 position:56%
Please explain why we should let you
back out to the general population?"

00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:57.230
And there's no warning right.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:00.340
You're just walking
into an improved moment.

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:02.540
And she was like "Well
you shouldn't let me out."

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:05.010
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez: Yeah, I mean
that's thing, you really found

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:08.510
out exactly who was good
and who was not so good

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:09.810
at improves in the auditions.

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:12.870
But we just throw as many
curve balls at them as possible

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:15.480
and switched the situations up and
just see what they came up with.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.240
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Let's
talk about the story itself.

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.540
I was told about, you know,

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:23.170
it's probably the most legendary
ghost story in cinema right now.

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:25.140
What was the process
of creating this story?

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:28.350
How did you know, did it
evolve from a basic ghost story

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:32.260
to a faux documentary almost?

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.210
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: Well, I feel
like, I mean, so it's um,

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:38.180
it ends up being a multi-step
process because you start off

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:39.740
with what compels you right.

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:41.630
So, Dan and Ed were like,

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:46.130
their first issue was what will
you believe that you can see that,

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:48.810
that we can justify spending
no money on the camera work.

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:51.530
Because the fatal flaw
in all student films,

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:53.480
is the camera work is terrible.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.140
And so, you're like so how can
you make that weakness a strength?

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:57.900
So, they went out there and it's
going to be the 'Blair Witch',

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:01.300
we're going to, get this back story
and then once we started editing it

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:03.120
and it came out on-this
is what we were talking

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.990
about the other day-split screen.

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:07.720
Then split screen people were
like "What is this story?

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.330
Is this a true story?

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:10.790
You have to tell me more about it."

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:15.400
And John Pierson who really
gave 'Blair' its original break,

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.090 position:56%
premiered it on split screen,
opened up his bulletin board system,

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:20.320
which was supposed to have
been in [inaudible] film.

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:23.700
And then everybody was like "I
need to know about this witch.

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.000
What is thing about Burkittsville?

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.440
Do you have the footage?

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:27.740
We want to know more."

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:29.040 position:56%
And then we had to launch a website.

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:31.680
And then the website
had to develop answers

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.240
to all these questions
that everybody had.

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:35.200
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: This is 1999,
I mean there was no such thing.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.830
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: It was the
year before the film came out.

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:38.130
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez:
No there was nothing.

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:39.550
&gt;&gt; Mike Monello: So, it was
before the film was even edited.

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:41.910
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: So, like do you
think a movie like this would be

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:44.850
as successful as it was in 1999?

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:47.910
In the world of, you know, Twitter
and Facebook, when you know,

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:52.110
in a 10-minute period people could
say that "Oh, this is not real.

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:55.180
There's no real Blair
Witch out there."

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.120
"There's no missing hikers."

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.020
&gt;&gt; Mike Monello: It
can be, you know,

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:04.360 position:56%
I mean the whole is it real is it
not real angle would not fly at all.

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:06.560
But I think we still
see that people want

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.740
to play along with great stories.

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:10.630
In particular great ghost stories.

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:12.020
So, I think it could be done.

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:13.820
It wouldn't be done the same way.

00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:15.840
I think the story wouldn't
necessarily be told the same way,

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:17.230
but absolutely, like when you look

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:19.580
at internet myths like
'Slender Man'.

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:22.820
I think that's an example of
people participating in a,

00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:26.680
in a new kind of ghost
story mythology, um, um,

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:27.980
in very interesting ways.

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:32.020 position:56%
In very similar ways that people
did originally around 'Blair Witch',

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:35.490
particularly in that period of
time between the website launching

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:39.970
and the movie premiering at
Sundance and then that you know,

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:42.990
from Sundance to when
it premiered in cinemas

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:45.140
which was practically a full year.

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:47.550
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: I mean USA Today
said this is probably the first

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:49.110
movie that ever went viral.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.410
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: Right.

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:54.640
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Especially how
technology was in 1999 and or 1998

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.190 position:56%
and 1999 compared to what it is now.

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:57.490
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: Right.

00:17:57.490 --> 00:18:00.980
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: So, how do you,
how do you feel how the viewers

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:04.440
or the audience reacted
after watching it?

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:07.530
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: You're
going to have to answer

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:08.830
that question [chuckles].

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:10.130
&gt;&gt; Mike Monello: About going viral?

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:11.430
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Yes.

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:12.910
Or like the response that
you got from the audience

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:14.390
after they saw this movie?

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:16.410
&gt;&gt; Mike Monello: Well,
I don't know, for me,

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:19.680
I suspect we'll have different
answers because we got, the, the,

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:23.160
I have very, like, like, I
think to a lot of people,

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.930
particularly Hollywood, 'Blair
Witch' came out of nowhere.

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:27.910
Right and just, and
they, it didn't get

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:31.170 position:56%
on their radar until maybe Sundance.

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:34.450
But for us by the time we
were at Sundance, right,

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:38.160
like I remember distinctly it was
a midnight screening, the premier,

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.190
and we were there and I had been to
Sundance a couple of times before

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:43.080 position:56%
because I worked at a film festival.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.590
And, so I knew the environment.

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:48.220
And we're standing there at the
midnight screening and the, the,

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:50.590
if you've ever been, there's
like the film had sold

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:52.680
out before the festival started.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.680
And they, you do a standby line.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:58.070
And it was midnight and the
film was, the screening in, in,

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:02.460
in Salt Lake City later that week,
and that screening hadn't sold out.

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:05.700
The standby line to see it at
midnight at the premier was packed!

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:07.000
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: What does
standby line mean, just in case?

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.910
&gt;&gt; Mike Monello: The standby
line is like, the film sold out,

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:11.980
but there's pass holders, so they
sell standby lines, you get in line

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:15.340
and you get a number and then
if, if somebody, if a certain,

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:18.480
pass holders don't show up, and
there's 15 or 20 seats open,

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:19.990
they let 15 or 20 people in.

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:21.650
Which would be a large number.

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:23.170
Of people to get let in.

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:25.010
There were like I don't
know like a 100.

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:26.360
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez: A
lot, there was a lot.

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:27.660
&gt;&gt; Mike Monello: And
they were students.

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:29.660
They were college students,
they were high school kids.

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:33.230
Who you never see come up, up
the mountain and to the festival.

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:34.700
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Do you
think helped spread the word?

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:37.220 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mike Monello: Well, we knew, we
knew that was from the word of mouth

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:41.560
that had been going on for like six
months before we got to Sundance.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:45.160
I mean, I even, we were
talking there and we said "Look,

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.960
if we don't get a deal that we
like, we can four wall this.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.260
I remember telling you.

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:52.070
I said we can four wall
the theaters and make our,

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:55.200
our, investors' money back."

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.120
Just because we've
already built an audience.

00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.540
But nobody, nobody, none
of the distributors walking

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:03.290
in really understood and when
Artisan bought the film they

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:06.730
actually, the, the, they said that
there was a split in the company

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:09.040
with the older executives
going "We don't get it?"

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:12.310
And all the younger executives
going "We have to buy this film!"

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:14.780
Because they had been
following it on the website.

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:19.140
And um, and the, the, one of
the co-presidents said that,

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:21.680
what sent him over the line
and decided to buy to it,

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.510
was actually he noticed that split.

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:25.960
And when he was the
split, the age split,

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.460
he realized that something
was happening

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:30.200
that he just hadn't
seen and went with it.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.500
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: Well
and I think to speak

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.190
to what Mike said a
little bit earlier,

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:36.860
I don't know if anybody
has kids that do Minecraft?

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.160
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Probably is.

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.460
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: And there's,
there's a ghost story.

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:40.760
Do you know this ghost
story in Minecraft?

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.060
Who is that guy again?

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:43.360
With the eyes?

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.870
&gt;&gt; Mike Monello: Oh,
I don't know that one.

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:46.230
&gt;&gt;Julia Myrick: So,
so, it's this myth

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:50.650
that the coder had put a secret
evil inside Minecraft and there's,

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:51.950 position:56%
oh I wish I could remember his name.

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:55.160
But, all of my son's
friends knew about it.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:59.370
And the it became an excuse of
"I didn't blow up your world!

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:01.120 position:56%
That evil ghost blew up your world."

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.060
And because of my history, my
son's world got blown up "Oh,

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:07.030
I don't know who blew
up your son's village.

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:08.330
It wasn't me.

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:10.450
It was, I saw, I saw
this evil character.

00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:11.750
That's in the code."

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:14.700
So, I sat them down and
I'm like "Let me explain

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:16.180
to you how a viral myth starts.

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:21.150
And how you cannot use a viral
myth on me to lie about blowing

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:24.250
up my child's [chuckles] village."

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:26.560
But looking at that
again, like, in some ways,

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:29.150 position:56%
I'm like oh you can't do this again,
because the audience is too savvy,

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:30.580
but my son's not too savvy,

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:33.960
he's like I think maybe this evil
ghost inside Minecraft actually

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.260
did it.

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:36.560
And I'm like, no.

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:37.860
You want to believe that.

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:39.160
Everybody else has picked it up.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:42.960
Every twelve-year-old boy is
like this is true, I've seen it,

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.870
I'm going to perpetuate the myth.

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:47.930
I witnessed it, my story
is also a true story.

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:51.560
So, I think, we, we're
constantly doing this to ourselves.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:53.920
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Were you
guys ready for the tsunami

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.530
that happened when
the movie came out?

00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:58.780
I remember watch the cast on the
Tonight Show and they were all kind

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:01.140
of like deer in the headlights
of what was happening.

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:02.440
How did you guys react to it?

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:08.120
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez: It was, you
know, it was just like a crazy ride

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:13.360
and it was, it was like one thing
after another and we kind of became

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.710
like a little bit desensitized
to it.

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:19.840
And I think that the fact that we
were um, you know, there was five

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:22.220
of us in the company and then
there was other people all

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:23.520
around us that had.

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:26.040
You know, we had really built
this movie up as a community.

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:29.230
Um, I think that was the reason
that nobody kind of lost themselves

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:32.500
and like went off and to L.A.
and like, became you know,

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.860
you know this crazy, you
know, Hollywood person.

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:39.180
You know, like we all kind of,
there was so much temptation,

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.650
so much like craziness going on,

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:44.490
like things that we never
imagined were ever going

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:45.970
to happen to us, were happening.

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:48.140
And then on right after
the other you know.

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:50.520
And but, it was, and it was,
actually got to the point

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:54.500
where it was kind of scary because
after, Dan and I were like, well,

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:55.800
we're going to have
to, we're going to have

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.310
to make another movie after this.

00:22:57.310 --> 00:23:00.520
And, whatever we do no matter
what the hell we do, this is,

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:01.950 position:56%
it's never going to compare to this.

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:06.370
So, we, I remember one,
Dan and I sitting in like,

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:08.810
it was Canada somewhere we were
in the middle of the press tour

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:11.820
and it was like you know,
just question after question.

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:14.740
But for us it was like, we love
talking about it, nobody's asked us

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:18.180
about our movie ever, so you
know, this much, so we were really

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:20.770
into it, but and we were
enjoying it, and we were,

00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:22.090
and we were just sitting
there doing our break,

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:26.010 position:56%
and we were like just sitting there,
you know, in this café somewhere

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:29.590
and we're like "Man this is never
going to happen to us again."

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:32.940
You know, we have to like enjoy it
and we were like "Yeah absolutely.

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:34.240 position:56%
This is never going to happen again.

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:37.460
This is like a miracle and we
just have to kind of ride the wave

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:40.610
and see where it takes us and not
take ourselves too seriously."

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:42.420
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Twenty years
later, almost 20 years later,

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:44.610
how do you guys looking
back at this?

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:46.720
&gt;&gt;Julia Myrick: I still think
it's an amazing phenomenon.

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:49.570
I think what I have been
talking about today,

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:51.300
coming through the Library
of Congress and looking

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:55.190
up paraphernalia and remembering
some of the interesting things

00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:56.550
that I got into at the time was,

00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:59.010
I'm like "Oh I'll go
to the land records.

00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:00.310
I'll write down the land records

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:04.170
for 'Blair Witch' I'll help
fabricate this part of the story."

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:07.220
We had lots of conversation
about true fakeness

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:09.170
and fake this is the
fake, fake document.

00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:10.470
This is a true fake document.

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:13.310
And this is a true document that's
unrelated to the story at all.

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:15.380
That we've used to bring
in some credibility.

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:19.040
And because of that experience
from that, I've continued to be

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:21.080
"Oh, Bigfoot could be real.

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:22.390
Here's a fake document.

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:23.690
Here's a true.

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:24.990
The Lock Ness Monster."

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:27.170
And then today when I see things,

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:30.530
like you know, just
in the modern age.

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:32.080
You're like is this a true story?

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:35.630
I need to look the source material,
because I know from my experience,

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:39.600
I'll say "Here's a piece of
source material, I've linked it.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:41.420
It proves that the
Blair Witch is real.

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:44.150
But if you click on it,
and you actually read it,

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:46.860
it doesn't really do
what I said it does."

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:50.220
But, you'll tend not to look at
it, you're like "Oh", for instance,

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:53.210
Maryland's Historical Society
for years had people call up

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:56.590
and say "I need this book that's
the 'Cult of the Blair Witch'.

00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:59.540
It was published in 1870,
there's one copy you have it.

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:00.900 position:56%
Because it says it on this website."

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:02.200 position:56%
And they're like "It doesn't exist."

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.500
And they're like "So you
won't show it to us?"

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:05.080
[ Laughter ]

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:06.380
And they're like "No,
no, it doesn't exist.

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:07.700
It's not a real thing,
there's no such thing book."

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:09.290
And they're like "Well
you had it and now."

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:11.340
And so, we put on, it's
in a private collection.

00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:13.840
So, people will leave the poor
Maryland Historical Society alone.

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.630
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez: They
still won't show to us.

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:17.610
They still won't show
it us, I don't know.

00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:18.910
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: And then you know.

00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:20.810
So, it's just a cover
and there's some stuff

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:22.410
that we fabricated for inside it.

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:26.270
But, um, I think as I was
fabricating more documents,

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:28.320
then I would look for the
documents that I fabricated.

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.620
Because I referenced the very one.

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:30.920
I wanted it to look accurate.

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:33.040
"Like here's the Dewey Decimal
number, here's the code,

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.620
and I'm like, this isn't here?

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:36.010
Oh, because I made that up."

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:37.310
[ Laughter ]

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:40.630
And, And, there's a book 'The
13th Warrior' where he was like

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:41.960
"The true story of Beowulf.

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:45.230
There was an Arabian man joined
the Vikings to kill Beowulf."

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:47.660
And he had references
in the back of his book.

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:48.960
And he had the same problem.

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.560
I remember feeling
sympathy with him.

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:51.860
I'm like "I know!'

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:53.160
He's like "I spent months."

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.740
"I know that this is what
inspired me to write this."

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:57.040
"Oh no that's fake.

00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:58.340
I faked that."

00:25:58.340 --> 00:25:59.730
"Oh! That's no there."

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:04.780
And so, just today I was looking
at these old notes and I said um

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:07.520
"Oh look at this interesting
thing that I had come up with.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.940
I'm going to Google myself
to see what else I did."

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:12.180
And there was somebody
that was saying "Oh this,

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:13.970
this 'Cult of the Blair
Witch' book isn't true,

00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:15.740
but here's 10 true things."

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:19.620
A very obscure website, 'Top'
like you know, I don't know,

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:23.350
'Facts of the world.com',
something very strange.

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:24.650
And I'm like "Oh!

00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:25.950
Look at these true stories."

00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:27.880 position:56%
I instantly believed they were true.

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:29.180
This is my business.

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:30.730 position:56%
You can say anything, somebody needs

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:33.890
to make money selling the
top 10 things, I have no idea

00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:36.510
if the first one that they said
was a true Maryland witch story,

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:39.260
but I believe it, because it
came from the most obscure,

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:41.430
least referenced place ever.

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:43.520
And I'm like, well you said I was
a liar, which I know I'm a lie,

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:45.240
so you must be a truth teller.

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.400
&gt;&gt; Mike Monello: Which actually
goes back to the question you asked

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.410
"If you could do this again today?"

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:52.210
I actually think that we
probably went WAY deeper

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:56.000
in fabricating the narrative,
for the myth for 'Blair Witch'

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.240
than most fake news sites do

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:01.010
to fabricate the slight
evidence that they use to.

00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:02.310
[ Laughter ]

00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:03.610
That people willingly believe now.

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:04.910
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez: Yeah.

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:06.210
&gt;&gt; Mike Monello: There's
actually, I think,

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:07.690
less need to prove
something's true today.

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:10.000
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: It was the
1998 version of fake news I guess.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.300
Right.

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:12.600
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: I mean it
actually really is interesting,

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.460
I never thought this would be
so salient on a national stage,

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:18.500
but in the last year, there's
certain things that you did

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:21.280
and you can't make
a good ghost story

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:22.580
if people don't want to believe.

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:23.880
Like X-Files is true.

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.330
If you want to believe in UFO's you
will look for reasons to believe.

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:28.250
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Trust me, my
name Roswell, I know the exact.

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:30.490
[ Laughter ]

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:32.750
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: But so,
you can't have the success

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:35.750
if people don't want
the success to come.

00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:38.740
So, if I tried to sell you a story
on caterpillars, you're not going

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:40.840
to do the work, to search
out that information.

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:42.240
Like, I just don't care.

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:44.860
But, we want witch
stories to be true.

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:47.120 position:56%
We've heard them when we were young.

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:51.070 position:56%
When you stumble across it in a
certain way, the more obscure it is,

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:53.500
the more you feel like I
finally found the real one.

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:54.990
thought it was out there.

00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:56.430
I know that this town is nearby.

00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:57.730
You don't.

00:27:57.730 --> 00:28:00.450
We had even private investigators
who were like I've always wanted

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:02.380
to investigate a witch
story and they really did.

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:04.360
And so, just spent three
weeks trying to figure

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:06.290
out they could help us
find these three students.

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:07.940
So, finally called us up
and like "I'm having a lot

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:09.540
of problems tracking
information down."

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:10.840
But part of it is because
they wanted

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:13.070
to believe the story was true.

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:16.560
And so, if you have a
story and it doesn't matter

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:19.430
if it's more a factual story or
mythological story, you're like,

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:21.420
I want to believe my
world view is true.

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:24.760
I want to believe this person's
horrible or this person is great.

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:27.590
And this obscure site said
that this thing was true

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:29.400
and they're saying
nobody's reporting it

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:31.620
because you don't want
to hear the truth.

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:32.920
&gt;&gt; Mike Monello: Yeah.

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:34.330
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: You know, Maryland
Historical Society doesn't want

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:35.630
to show you the book.

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:36.930
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez:
They're hiding it.

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:38.230
They're hiding it.

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:39.530
&gt;&gt; Mike Monello: Yeah.

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:40.830
I mean the thing is, is that
when it comes to ghost stories

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:44.440
in particular, I think, it's
human nature to want to believe

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.580
that there are forces
that play in the world

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:49.240
that are affecting our lives
that we have no control over.

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:50.780
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Or it's
beyond human capacity.

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:52.080
&gt;&gt; Mike Monello: Yes.

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.110
And, and that's just a
simple fact of human nature.

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:58.690 position:56%
So, you know, you're crafting a
myth that essentially plays on that.

00:28:58.690 --> 00:29:01.560
It's, you know, and then on top
of that, like what Ed was saying,

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:05.820
is that, you know, when cutting
the film together was always like,

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:10.910 position:56%
you can never give a piece, every
piece of information can suggest one

00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:14.430
or another, but it can
never definitively say,

00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:19.450 position:56%
it's something super natural or it's
something that's, you know, human.

00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:22.380
And so, when you're playing
that balance the whole time,

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:25.260
you're basically feeding
the evidence for whoever,

00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:29.090
whatever story the
viewer wants to believe.

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:30.750
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Before we
take questions from the audience.

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:33.640
Um, let's do a little
quick where are they now?

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.570
Could you tell us, where
the cast members are

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:37.740
and what projects all three of
you guys are working on now?

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:39.040
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: Oh.

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:40.340
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
We'll start with Ed.

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:45.350
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez: The cast,
um, um, Mike Williams is ah, ah,

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:48.200
a high school counselor now.

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:50.560
Ah, he got out of the business
probably like ten years ago.

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.220
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: The last time
we saw him he was facing the law.

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:53.520
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez: Yes.

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:56.980
Exactly. He still acts, but he
is a happy guy just, you know,

00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:58.910
doing the high school
counselor thing.

00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:02.870
And them, um, Joshua's still
acting, he's still directing.

00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:05.200
He does a lot of TV stuff.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:06.580
Ah, a lot of TV work.

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:11.370
He was on 'Bates Motel', which I
just, we just watched recently.

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:16.340
Um, and then Heather is, was in the
business for a while and then she,

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:20.780
she went off and grew pot
for a while, um, and now,

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:22.650
I'm not sure where Heather is.

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:25.700
She kind of goes on and
off, on and off on Facebook

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:27.660
and kind of just, she's kind of.

00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:28.960
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: Carpe Diem.

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.260
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez: Kind of
doing her own thing, you know.

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:31.560
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: She
might be in Colorado anyway?

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:32.860 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez: Yeah [chuckles].

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:34.160
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: What
projects are you working on?

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:35.780
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez: I'm, I'm
mostly on, working on TV right now.

00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:40.800
Ah, just directing TV shows
and developing features and um,

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:42.240
still trying to make features,

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:45.860
but the Indie feature world
is very difficult right now.

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:48.980
So, just moving forward
on TV and trying

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:50.490
to get our own TV show on the air.

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:53.420
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Before, um,
Mike answers, I should say though

00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:56.100
when this movie came out, I
think it gave a little big boost

00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:58.900
for independent filmmakers
or student filmmakers.

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:00.200
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez: Absolutely.

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.500
And, and, that's what I
think, is like for me,

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:05.030
it's like the thing I'm most proud
of because like when I was young,

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:07.030
there was these movies and
there were these filmmakers

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:08.670
that are like, really inspired me.

00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:13.660 position:56%
And the fact that, you know, there's
some people out there who, um,

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:16.420
just went out and tried
to do it because of us.

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:18.650
Because we really did
prove that anybody, these,

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:22.270 position:56%
these completely unknown people
with the right idea and a little bit

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:24.370
of luck, actually a lot of luck.

00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:27.720
Can do something that kind of,
you know, has this kind of impact.

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.210
So, I think we definitely
inspired people.

00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:32.380
Just the way I was inspired
by 'Clerks' and 'El Mariachi'

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:35.010
and you know 'She's Gotta Have It'.

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:37.400
You know before that
I, I loved the fact

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:39.300
that 'Blair Witch'
still inspires people.

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:41.670
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
How about you Mike?

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:47.620
&gt;&gt; Mike Monello: Um, yeah, so I, I
really loved the kind of, you know,

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:51.750
the, the, you know, taking this
mythology that was really built

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:56.870
for the actors to improvise from
and, and as we released it online

00:31:56.870 --> 00:32:00.350
and see how audience's
kind of took it, and, and,

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:03.610
and the way that we were
essentially improvising the story

00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:04.910
with them in that sense.

00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:07.990
Improvising by the way it was
released and how we decided

00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:09.590
to kind of, what we
decided to flush out

00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:11.450
and what we decided to hold back.

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:15.660
Um, I, I, I, wanted
to do more of that.

00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:18.080
And, um, it was still
early days, Hollywood even

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:21.350
after 'Blair Witch' was still
like, "Ah, no that's marketing.

00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:23.620
We're not going to
find anything online."

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:26.110
And um, and so I started
actually, ah,

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:28.850
a marketing agency
called "Campfire".

00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:32.530
And we work with, ah,
entertainment brands.

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:38.550
Do a lot of work with HBO, Netflix,
Amazon and we essentially do a lot

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:40.490
of what we were doing with 'Blair
Witch', which was help them build

00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:43.200
out there, the worlds
of their shows, um,

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:45.670
online and in other forms of media.

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:46.970
So, we continue to do that,

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:49.390
we like recently did a
whole experimental thing

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:52.570
at New York Comic Con for
'Westworld', so I love it.

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:55.540
It's like we basically kind
of create these experiences

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:58.830
that go beyond the, the,
the, original property.

00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:00.130
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Excellent.

00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:01.430
How about you Julia?

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:02.730
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: Well, from
the 'Blair' stuff I did a bunch

00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:04.930
of research for, we researched
for 'In Search Of' and then we had

00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:08.480
to do this whole elaborate
backstory for 'Hellboy'

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:09.780
with the Lance of Longinus.

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:13.600
So, from that I got to do
these great research projects

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.990
into really obscure kind of
paranormal sort of things.

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:17.840
But since then I've
been script writing

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.850
for science fiction and horror.

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:22.200
I had a movie come out
called 'Alien Raiders'.

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:25.610
I have another coming out from
Bonaventure Pictures called

00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:26.910
'Higher Power'.

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:30.620
And I just finished one for STX
which we'll see if it goes about.

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:33.210 position:56%
It's like a cow version of Godzilla.

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:37.860
You know Godzilla's come up, it's
through the nuclear holocaust

00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:41.090
and GMO comeuppances is coming
and the cows, will [growl],

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:42.570
get their revenge [chuckles].

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:45.670
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: So, I think
we time for one or two questions

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:47.380
from the audience if
anybody has one?

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:49.450
We'll start with you sir.

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:50.750
&gt;&gt; Hello.

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:56.530 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: We have the
microphone coming in your direction.

00:33:56.530 --> 00:33:58.300
&gt;&gt; Very interested in, ah,

00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:01.180
kind of the blended media
movement that's kind

00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:02.940
of been going pass couple of years.

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:07.770
Blended media, meaning both
film and interactive media,

00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:11.320
such as computer games,
that can be blended together

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:15.100
to perhaps tell a story, if
you're doing a fictional film.

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:17.940
But also, looking at,
personally myself,

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:24.120
how you would design blended
media that is non-fiction?

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:30.360
And in particular, if you have a
non-fiction genre that has lots

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:35.130
of elements of horror,
meaning, it attacks someone,

00:34:35.130 --> 00:34:38.370
it attacks the viewer
or the consumer in a way

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:41.690
that they feel very scared.

00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:46.880
Um, have you any experiences
first with, ah, computer games?

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:51.400
In either sort of the 'Blair
Witch' kind of phenomenon

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:54.950
or any suggestions on how
to blend a computer game

00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:59.370
and some other movie that's
being presented as non-fiction?

00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:00.670
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: I think
that's a good Mike question.

00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:02.900
&gt;&gt; Mike Monello: Um,
I would look at, ah,

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:05.200
the National Film Board of Canada.

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:07.670
They, um, have been
funding for years now,

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:11.440
a lot of kind of interactive
documentary work.

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:13.680
And it's all available
on their website.

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.490
There's an enormous amount of it.

00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:19.500
And, and, and, some of it is
quite excellent in terms of like,

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:22.450
just thinking about how
to convey those stories.

00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:25.770
As for video games, I
mean, there were three,

00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:28.180
there were three video games
that actually came out as part

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:30.330
of 'Blair Witch' but they were,

00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:33.770
they were really largely done
by, ah, the game company.

00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:38.430 position:56%
I mean the stories were kind of
pulled from the, the mythology, but.

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:40.370
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: Didn't you do some
multimedia anything with horror

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:46.050
or where you're like, this
collaborative, kind of horror?

00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:48.400
&gt;&gt; Mike Monello: There've been,
but you know, in terms of like,

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.070
topping the things that are real.

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:54.530
I mean that's a, that's a tall
order when you start to do that,

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:57.560
because you know you're
dealing with real people.

00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:59.070
Real people's stories.

00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:02.430 position:56%
So, I think it's ah, I think
there's a lot of more ethical issues

00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:06.750
around it, then maybe
with fiction narrative.

00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:08.770
&gt;&gt; You brought up the video games.

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:11.220
I never got a chance to ask
you guys, what do you think

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:13.910
of the sequels that came after
the original movie 'Blair Witch'?

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:16.040
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry.

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:18.070
[ Laughter ]

00:36:18.070 --> 00:36:19.370
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
We'll start with Ed.

00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:23.110 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez: Um, this, these,
these, the first sequel was um,

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:24.910
you know, it was a weird time.

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:28.400
We had just finished the movie and
they were, Artisan, to come to the,

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.920
about 'Blair Witch', was like we've
got to do a sequel right away,

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:34.310
we're going to release
it next, um, Halloween.

00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:35.610
And um.

00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:36.910
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Did you
guys have any input on it?

00:36:36.910 --> 00:36:39.190
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez: Well, we, we
had input on it until we told them

00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:41.440
that we didn't like what
they were doing and they kind

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:42.970
of didn't pay attention
to us anymore.

00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:47.240
So, the, the first sequel was a
little bit, it was really rushed

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:48.780
and it wasn't quite the right idea.

00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:51.600
And I don't think it's a terrible
film, but I don't think it has,

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.310 position:56%
it's like a cousin of 'Blair Witch'.

00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:55.740
It doesn't really belong
in our mythology.

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:58.860
And then the second sequel
that came out last year, um,

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:02.530 position:56%
I think that one ties in much better
to the original mythology and I,

00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:03.830 position:56%
I enjoyed that one a lot more, yeah.

00:37:03.830 --> 00:37:05.760
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: How about you?

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:08.770
&gt;&gt; Mike Monello: Um, um, I'm trying
to, ah, [laughter] I'm trying

00:37:08.770 --> 00:37:13.930 position:56%
to think how to answer this and
not, most politically expedient way.

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:18.450
Um, I think, I think the
second film was made by people

00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:22.160 position:56%
who were looking to push out a film.

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:25.530
Who were thinking about a brand
called 'Blair Witch' rather

00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:27.490
than a film or the fans.

00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:29.570
And I think the film reflects that.

00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:34.730
I think that, um, you know, I
that it was and I think that's,

00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:38.370
that's the studio, I
think the filmmaker wanted

00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:41.470 position:56%
to tell a completely different story
and wasn't necessarily interested

00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:43.630
in the 'Blair Witch' story.

00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:45.800
And so, took it in
a direction there.

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:48.100
So, I really think it's I
wouldn't even called it a cousin,

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:54.510
I would say it's really somebody
else's idea of, of the socio,

00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:57.860 position:56%
sociological impact of 'Blair Witch'
and wanting to make a commentary

00:37:57.860 --> 00:38:00.490
on it and doing it under
the name of 'Blair Witch'.

00:38:00.490 --> 00:38:06.060
Um, I think, I actually just
recently saw the other sequel,

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:09.270
which was fun, but,
uh, uh, it was fun.

00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:12.580
It felt like a reboot, right,
because it was hitting a lot

00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:14.450
of the same beats in that sense.

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:17.760
Um, but what I really think
for me, was the most sad,

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:20.470
is that about the sequels.

00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:24.000
Is that, um, I feel like the
'Blair Witch' franchise right now,

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.280
is in the hands of people who
still don't respect they think Ed

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:29.800
and Dan brought to it.

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:34.320
And I think that there's definitely
some thought thinking and care

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:38.320
around it and I think
that the original ideas

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:42.740
for how a franchise would actually
rollout, were in my opinion,

00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:45.970
infinitely more interesting
and more commercial

00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:48.410
than what has come out today.

00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:52.090
But, I don't think we'll ever
see those films unfortunately.

00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:54.410
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Julia,
for the person who helped.

00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:55.710
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: Build the mystery.

00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:57.010
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Build the story.

00:38:57.010 --> 00:38:58.310
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: Well, I
would you know, the thing is,

00:38:58.310 --> 00:39:03.390
is I think that within the core
group, so you have like the five

00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:06.280
and then you an additional seven,
and then it gets to 20 and.

00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:10.720
I don't think that even internally
we all would agree on "Oh,

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:12.470
this is what I liked
the most about".

00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:14.740
I think Ed and I even
have different views

00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:16.660
of what's happening in the woods.

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:19.510
You know, I have a whole,
"Oh, the Native Americans

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:21.890
and there's a specific
incident that happened.

00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:24.160
And it's the evil that
was there the whole time."

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:25.460 position:56%
And I have a whole story in my head.

00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:28.730
And that's the story I
want in a sequel and the.

00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:30.900
And I don't think that
they would do that one.

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:33.320
And I think Ed might do something
a little different than Dan.

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:37.270
So, it's, it's hard to, it's hard
to pass judgement on anything.

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:39.780
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina; So, you think
there's never going to be like ah,

00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:41.520
like 'Friday the 13th',
12 or something?

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:42.820
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: Mine
should happen [chuckles].

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:44.120
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
'Blair Witch' the theme.

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:45.420
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: I don't know.

00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:48.780
I mean I actually think there's,
I there's a specific space

00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:50.310
that 'Blair' could continue.

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:52.220
I don't think that it's the
space that they're following.

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:54.510
I don't think it's
the narrative type.

00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:55.930
It's not a traditional story.

00:39:55.930 --> 00:40:00.440
I think that if we went back into
this more, audience collaboration.

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:01.960
&gt;&gt; Mike Monello: Well, on
a very basic level right.

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.400
If you follow the mythology,

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:06.100
you actually can't have
a sequel until 2034.

00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:07.400
Right?

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:08.700
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: Exactly.

00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:10.000
&gt;&gt; Mike Monello: 2034?

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.300
2044?

00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:12.600
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: So,
stay tuned for 2034.

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:13.900
[ Laughter ]

00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:15.200
&gt;&gt; Mike Monello: So, technically
right, there can't be a sequel.

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:16.500 position:56%
I think the only movies you can
make are the ones that go backwards.

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:17.800
In my opinion.

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:19.100
That's the.

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:20.400
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: And then in 2034,
it's going to have to be somebody

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:21.700
with their own camera and it's not.

00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:23.000
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Their own
iPhone or their own Smartphone.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.300
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: Exactly.

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:25.600
Or what. Their own virtual reality.

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.010
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez: Yeah,
it'll be like a holographic.

00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:28.310
[ Laughter ]

00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:29.610
Experience or something.

00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:30.910
You know.

00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:32.210
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: We'll
do one more question.

00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:34.360
I see the gentleman
there in the middle.

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:36.880
&gt;&gt; They're saying something
about insatiable happened tonight

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:42.000
for a really gross-out gore and
horror films like 'Walking Dead'

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:47.430
and contrary to distinction
to your film, which,

00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:50.820
was about the imagination.

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:54.910
Which can be far more terrifying,
seeing people's entrails,

00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:56.750
you know pouring out on the screen.

00:40:56.750 --> 00:41:03.450
So, why do you think today we're so
fascinated by zombies and so forth,

00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:06.180
and do you think it's
the excessive amount

00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:10.990
of violence being perpetrated
on the screen?

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:12.580
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: I
agree with that one.

00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:15.690
I think that there's a. And I
actually think a lot of it is just,

00:41:15.690 --> 00:41:18.950
it's easy, and including
in script writing, right.

00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:21.110
It's easy to say and then
their head gets chopped off.

00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:24.930 position:56%
Right. And if you're going to say it
was really, the person was terrified

00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:30.720
of dying, that's much more
complicated to do correctly.

00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:33.480
And instead you're just
like, I'm bored, I'm not,

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:35.520
I don't feel this emotion
that you're feeling.

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:37.620
But if you chop the head off
like I showed you somebody

00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:40.120
with their head chopped off, and
now you should feel something.

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:42.150
Because an event happened.

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:44.570
So, I think probably
a lot of reasons

00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:49.650
in movies you see clear cut awful
things happen, is because it's,

00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:52.780
it's easier to pull off,
you know what that beats are

00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:54.080
and the beats go that way.

00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:57.650
And also, I will say that when you
get to the machine of Hollywood

00:41:57.650 --> 00:41:59.510
and I know, both of these
guys have experience this,

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:01.750
and you go into a room and
you're like "Ok, here's my story

00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:03.050
and you don't know
what's happening."

00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:04.670
And they're like "Well, you
have to know what's happening.

00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:06.080
Because I'm the executive."

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:07.550
So, you have to explain
it to them "Ok,

00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:09.070
let me explain the
backstory to you."

00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:13.290
So, I've always agreed with Ed
like, they did the story right

00:42:13.290 --> 00:42:15.940 position:56%
because it's a ghost story, you come
in you're like Bloody Mary's going

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:17.240
to show up in the mirror.

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:20.400
And then you don't say and here
is the novel to read to explain

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.610
to you the history of why she
would show up in a mirror.

00:42:22.610 --> 00:42:25.040 position:56%
And now you're not scared any more,
you're like I know this will happen,

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:26.340
this is where the person.

00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:28.370
And you don't need a
lot of explanation.

00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:31.440
But, in film studios you
need a lot of explanation

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:32.740
and then you're like "Ok."

00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:34.250
And then they kill this person
and they kill this person

00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:36.640 position:56%
and all this stuff and then suddenly
everything becomes a lot more

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:40.490
literalized, a lot more explained
and then it's not scary anymore

00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:43.620
and then sometimes it's just "Well,
we'll just do the brutal version."

00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:46.460 position:56%
Because there's specific people that
like the brutal part of the film,

00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:47.760
so we'll just make the whole film.

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.060
&gt;&gt; Mike Monello: Well, yeah.

00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:51.520
I mean think you know, it's
kind of like comedies, you know,

00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:54.890 position:56%
there's really intelligent satires
and then there's gross-out comedies.

00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:58.670 position:56%
And I think horror's like that and I
think the films with a lot of gore,

00:42:58.670 --> 00:43:03.400
are kind of about a
different emotional state.

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:06.350
They're more like I
think a theme park ride.

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:11.120 position:56%
And um, and I think this, whereas
the more psychological horror films,

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:14.270
are really about trying, kind
of shaking you to your core.

00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:17.330
And sometimes you get a mixed
picture of both and something

00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:20.790
like the 'Exorcist' where
it's, it's pretty explicit,

00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:24.860
but at the same time it
also hits you deeply inside.

00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:28.390
But, um, that's a hard,
hard to balance it.

00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:31.550
And, and it's you know, to
Julia's point, it's a lot easier

00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:33.800
to see the commercial appeal
of the theme park ride

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:36.480 position:56%
than it is the psychological horror,

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:39.900
because those commercial
aspects are easy to market.

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:43.580 position:56%
Whereas with the more psychological
stuff, if the critics don't like it,

00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:45.170
it kind of becomes a hard sell.

00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:46.520
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez: Yeah,
and it becomes like,

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:48.950 position:56%
the search for like trailer moments.

00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:50.250
&gt;&gt; Mike Monello: Yeah.

00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:51.550
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez:
You know and you have

00:43:51.550 --> 00:43:53.450
like when it's a real subtle
movie that doesn't have, you know,

00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:55.810
it could be really scary,
whatever, but it doesn't have the,

00:43:55.810 --> 00:43:57.800
the trailer, you know,
thing exploding

00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:00.500
or somebody coming at
the camera, whatever.

00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:01.800
It's just hard to market you know.

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:05.160
But I mean, you know, for our
film, I mean, you know, I think Dan

00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:07.380
and I were definitely
fans of like you know,

00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:08.950
kind of the psychological stuff.

00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:12.680
But also, you know, what
our film, you know, the big,

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:18.420
the big reason why nothing happened
really, crazy or gory or anything

00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:21.020
in our film, I think a lot of it
had to do with we had no money.

00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:23.210
Um, because you know,
because everybody's task,

00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:24.510
everybody asks like, you know,

00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:26.690
"What was the original going
to be in this and that?"

00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:29.250
And I think that if we'd
had, if we'd had some money

00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:30.550
and we had some resources,

00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:32.670
we would've done something
a little bigger in the end.

00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:34.980
I mean, maybe we would've gone
back to the original ending?

00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:36.280
But, but.

00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:37.580
&gt;&gt; Mike Monello: We did shoot.

00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:38.880
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez: The gore.

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:40.180
And, because that ending for us,

00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:41.480
was like the hardest
thing to find, you know.

00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:43.890
To not betray the rest of movie
but a lot of it was just like,

00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:47.800
we can't um, we can't afford
to have, like Julia said,

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:49.890
we can't afford to have a
dismemberment, you know.

00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:53.010
We don't have the budget
to like really do it right.

00:44:53.010 --> 00:44:54.310
[ Laughter ]

00:44:54.310 --> 00:44:55.920
But I think if we'd had,
you know, unfortunately,

00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:58.660
if we'd have had the
resources, I think, you know,

00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:00.440
we would've added something
in there.

00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:02.080
I don't if it would've worked, but.

00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:04.790 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mike Monello: It's like Spielberg
and the shark not working in 'Jaws'.

00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:07.270
Except like a lot fewer zeros.

00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:08.570
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez: Yes.

00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:09.870
&gt;&gt; Mike Monello: On the budget.

00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:11.170
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez: Nothing.

00:45:11.170 --> 00:45:12.470
Yeah, I know, absolutely.

00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:13.770
[ Laughter ]

00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:15.070
You know a lot of it, like just
the creativity of just, you know,

00:45:15.070 --> 00:45:16.370
coming up with something
where you don't have,

00:45:16.370 --> 00:45:17.670
you have very limited
resources, you know.

00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:18.970
So.

00:45:18.970 --> 00:45:20.270
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: Well and I
would say but there's two things.

00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:22.780
Again, it's you actually,
like 'Jaws',

00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:25.340
you triumph when you're doing
less with limited resources,

00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:28.500
but we had a lot of things where
we're seeing other people do stuff

00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:29.800
and you're like if you have a,

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:31.320
if you have an 18-year-old
giving an interview,

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:32.620
they're clearly not a reporter.

00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:34.280
We don't have the budget
to hire somebody

00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:36.340
who is going to play
a reporter well.

00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:39.850
We don't have the budget to make
the sound stage look correct,

00:45:39.850 --> 00:45:41.350
so we're just not to
have that scene.

00:45:41.350 --> 00:45:46.160
And so, part of doing things
right is knowing that you're going

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:48.170
to do it badly and
so just don't do it.

00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:49.470
You're not allowed to have.

00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:50.770
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez: Yeah,
it's knowing your limitations

00:45:50.770 --> 00:45:52.570 position:56%
that you're not going to be able to
pull that off with that budget level

00:45:52.570 --> 00:45:54.480
and you just kind of find
another way to keep the audience.

00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:56.550
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: I always say that
90% of people, just if you're going

00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:59.200
to be in a low budget film,
90% people make that mistake.

00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:02.370
They're like, "Well, I'm going
to have ambition and I'm going,

00:46:02.370 --> 00:46:07.780
I'm going to show you all that I
can, you know do something for $20

00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:09.730
that takes you $20 million."

00:46:09.730 --> 00:46:12.670
And if you're just slightly off the
mark, then the whole movie fails.

00:46:12.670 --> 00:46:13.970
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez: Yeah.

00:46:13.970 --> 00:46:15.270
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: And you're like
man you almost pulled it off

00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:17.140
and now you've failed more
spectacularly and you have nothing

00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:18.740
to work with, which is unfortunate.

00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:20.040
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
Well, I appreciate all

00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:21.340
of you being here tonight.

00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:22.790
Um, on behalf of the
Library of Congress,

00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:24.090
we welcome you here of course.

00:46:24.090 --> 00:46:25.390
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez:
Thanks for having us.

00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:26.690
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
Thank you so much.

00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:27.990
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: Oh.

00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:29.290
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Oh.

00:46:29.290 --> 00:46:30.590
What?

00:46:30.590 --> 00:46:31.890
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: We have
a little present for you.

00:46:31.890 --> 00:46:33.190
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: I love presents.

00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:34.490
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: This is an
original Sundance poster from 1999.

00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:35.790 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Can we unfold it.

00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:37.090
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez: Yeah.

00:46:37.090 --> 00:46:38.390 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: We would love to.

00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:39.690
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: You can
have it at your disposal.

00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:40.990
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: I was
about say we can add it

00:46:40.990 --> 00:46:45.010
to our Halloween pop-up exhibit.

00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:46.310
I'm doing it backwards, sorry.

00:46:46.310 --> 00:46:48.570
I'm very anti-climactic here.

00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:51.650
Wow! This is great.

00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:52.950
&gt;&gt; Julia Myrick: Mint condition.

00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:54.250
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: It is.

00:46:54.250 --> 00:46:55.550
[ Laughter ]

00:46:55.550 --> 00:46:56.850
Thank you so much!

00:46:56.850 --> 00:46:58.150
We really appreciate it.

00:46:58.150 --> 00:46:59.450
&gt;&gt; Eduardo Sanchez: Sure.

00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:01.040
[ Applause ]

00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:02.350
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Thank you
again to Ed, Mike and Julia.

00:47:02.350 --> 00:47:08.470
So, for all of you who haven't
seen the 'Blair Witch Project',

00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:09.770
I hope you enjoy it.

00:47:09.770 --> 00:47:11.070
For all of you who are
going to re-watch it,

00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:12.440
get ready to be scared
all over again.

00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:14.510
Thank you again.

00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:19.580
