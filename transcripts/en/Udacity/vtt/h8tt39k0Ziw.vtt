First off, transactional middleware, recall that we have to

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.548
deal with reliability and those acid requirements. Various approaches including

00:00:09.548 --> 00:00:13.920
two-phased commit are policies which the application

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.329
can obey in order to get higher reliability and guaranteed consistency.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.000
We'd like to develop a transactional middleware solutions in such a way that we

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.570
have location transparency. That is, the pieces the server

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.150
doesn't know where the clients are distributed. And moreover, the clients don't

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.800
know where the server is other than possibly with some kind of IP address for

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.390
the web server. Some of the products over the years that have been developed for

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.840
dealing with transactional middleware include CICS on IBM mainframes.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.110
Tuxedo, which is a UNIX-based approach, and Encina, from Hewlett Packard.
