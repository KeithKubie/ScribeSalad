00:00:00.208 --> 00:00:02.736
Please tell me that you go through this too:

00:00:02.736 --> 00:00:04.114
So you're doing something random,

00:00:04.114 --> 00:00:05.836
like primping, or eating,

00:00:05.836 --> 00:00:07.040
or going back to high school

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.331
when you're a 20-something-year-old

00:00:08.331 --> 00:00:10.665
reporter who's never been kissed,

00:00:10.665 --> 00:00:11.918
when all of a sudden

00:00:11.918 --> 00:00:13.892
the past comes to ASSAULT you,

00:00:13.892 --> 00:00:16.602
with a horrible, embarassing,

00:00:16.602 --> 00:00:18.918
cringe-worthy memory that makes you go,

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:20.709
"What was I thinking?"

00:00:20.709 --> 00:00:21.831
I mean, it can be anything,

00:00:21.831 --> 00:00:23.799
from some lame conversation you had..

00:00:23.799 --> 00:00:26.449
TROLL IN THE DUNGEON!

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:28.454
I thought you would have known..

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:30.919
Eh?

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.879
Come on..

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:36.209
You read Harry Potter?

00:00:36.209 --> 00:00:37.831
To that time you thought you were Catwoman

00:00:37.831 --> 00:00:39.479
and things went horribly awry..

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:40.847
Ma'am, your daughter has been

00:00:40.847 --> 00:00:42.739
banned from PetCo for attempting

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:44.101
to shoplift kittens.

00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:46.418
Or some of your more, serious regrets.

00:00:47.515 --> 00:00:48.149
Fuck.

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.269
I mean, it's weird.

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:50.708
Sometimes I get embarassed over things

00:00:50.708 --> 00:00:51.979
I didn't even do.

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:53.923
Like, when I used to watch TV, I would

00:00:53.923 --> 00:00:56.678
feel so bad when the characters messed up

00:00:56.678 --> 00:00:58.953
that I could not watch them anymore.

00:00:58.953 --> 00:01:00.392
And look, on one hand,

00:01:00.392 --> 00:01:04.770
it is great that we can grow and learn
from our mistakes.

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.270
But then again, it sucks that we have memories

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.208
of those mistakes, and those memories

00:01:09.208 --> 00:01:10.741
will come lurching to the present

00:01:10.741 --> 00:01:12.165
with full force.

00:01:12.165 --> 00:01:16.071
I mean, just thinking about who you were
6 months ago..

00:01:16.071 --> 00:01:17.708
is disgusting.

00:01:17.708 --> 00:01:20.509
You know nothing, John Snow!

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.709
Whenever the past assaults you,

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:24.239
just try to embrace it.

00:01:24.239 --> 00:01:27.045
Like, "Oh yes, that memory was horrific.

00:01:27.045 --> 00:01:28.571
But I'm sure no one other than me

00:01:28.571 --> 00:01:30.224
is thinking about it right now.

00:01:30.224 --> 00:01:31.832
And I can reassure myself that

00:01:31.832 --> 00:01:33.800
there will be many more embarassing moments

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.286
in the future that I get to cringe over."

00:01:36.286 --> 00:01:38.893
Cause there's gonna be a lot.

00:01:38.893 --> 00:01:41.131
There's gonna be a lot of embarassing moments.

00:01:41.131 --> 00:01:42.362
Still to come.

00:01:42.362 --> 00:01:45.105
And relive, mentally, over and over.

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:47.831
So we have that to look forward to.

00:01:47.831 --> 00:01:49.710
I'll see you next week.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.448
Stay awesome, Gotham.

00:01:50.448 --> 00:01:50.948
