00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:10.990
On the 
morning of April 5, 1943, about ten miles

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.940
off the coast of Brazil, a fishing family
in their small boat spotted a Chinese man

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.740
on a much smaller wooden raft bobbing up and
down in the Atlantic Ocean.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.980
Waving a shirt and jumping, the man was clearly
in distress, so the Brazilian family turned

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.039
their boat around and picked him up.

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.419
Climbing aboard, he was overjoyed, hungry,
and very grateful.

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.670
As they set sail again, the man danced and
ate whatever was given to him.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.550
After three days, they landed in Belem, Brazil,
a town at the mouth of the Amazon River.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.730
Authorities were waiting for him as the man,
unassisted, walked off the boat.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.860
Considering his ordeal, this was an amazing
feat.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:51.320
You see, Poon Lim had been stranded at sea
for 133 days, a record for a lone human.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.980
Born in Hainan, China, the main island of
a series of islands in the South China Sea,

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.150
Poon Lim attended school, unlike many other
kids his age, thanks to his brothers sending

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.879
money from their factory jobs.

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.880
At 16, Lim’s father, believing that life
would be better elsewhere and out of fear

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.890
that Lim would be drafted to fight against
the rapidly advancing Japanese, sent him to

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.130
join one of his brothers on a British passenger
freight, working as a cabin boy.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.790
At first, according to his own account given
to Ruthanne McCunn in the book Sole Survivor,

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.369
he didn’t take to life at sea, getting sick
and teased constantly.

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.630
He eventually caught on to the ways of the
ship, but conditions were terrible for Chinese

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.820
crew members in general.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.960
Discriminated against, given the worst jobs,
and shoved into overwhelming cramped living

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.939
quarters, this was not the better life Poon,
or his father, envisioned.

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:40.720
His brother tried to make him feel better
by saying, “Hey, at least the British officers

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.520
aren’t beating us.”

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.090
As the years went by, the conditions for Chinese
crewmen on British ships got better, mostly

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.180
because they had too.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.850
The supply of British crewmen had decreased
due to World War II.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.960
Merchant ships, in order to keep up with the
intense demand the war had created, had to

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.840
entice workers by improving conditions and
increasing pay for Chinese crewmen.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.470
Lim had actually quit as a cabin boy in about
1937/1938 and moved to Hong Kong to enroll

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.909
in mechanics school.

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.650
After six months, the sea came calling again.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:13.600
His cousin told him of the improved conditions
and, most importantly, better pay.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.400
Plus, the Japanese were poised to capture
Hong Kong any day and Lim did not want to

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.850
be around when that happened.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.920
Thus, he signed on working under his cousin
as a Second Steward on the SS Benlomond.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.050
The SS Benlomond began its journey in Cape
Town on November 10, 1942 and was crossing

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.390
the Atlantic Ocean on its way to Suriname
(a Dutch-owned plantation colony in South

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.390
America) before sailing to New York.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.210
The Benlomond was known as a “tramp steamer”
in that it did not have a fixed schedule nor

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.140
published ports of call.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.410
Tramp steamers also often traveled solo, unlike
other trade ships that went in convoys.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.760
The Benlomond was armed, but its heavy, slow
movements made it an easy target.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.280
On November 23rd, more than two thirds into
the voyage, at about 11:30 am, it was torpedoed

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.880
by a Nazi U-boat.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.960
The ship sunk within two minutes.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:10.450
56 men perished, 24 British and 22 Chinese,
and only one man survived.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.930
That man was Poon Lim.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.970
In the mad rush of a sinking, exploding ship,
Lim was still able to grab a life jacket,

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.320
which likely saved his life, as he was, by
his own account, a poor swimmer.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.890
He then swam away from the sinking ship as
fast as he could.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.610
As this was all happening, he was spotted
in the water by the aggressors, the Nazi U-boat,

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.910
but was ignored, left to suffer in the cold
dark waters.

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.240
He floated in the ocean for what he estimates
was around two hours until he was able to

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.880
find one of the ship’s life rafts and swim
to it.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.500
It was a wooden raft about eight feet square,
with a partial canvas roof.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.900
Luckily for Lim, it had provisions on it:
a forty liter jug of water (about ten and

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.280
a half gallons), several tins of biscuits
and hardtack (a long-lasting cracker), pemmican

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.800
(sort of like beef jerky), malted milk tablets,
lumps of sugar, lime juice, two flairs, a

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.260
flashlight and even some chocolate.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.920
This was to be Lim’s home for the next 133
days.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.400
He initially thought he was going to get rescued
quickly, as soon as clients realized that

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.100
the Benlomond hadn’t docked.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.830
So, he only partitioned the food out for thirty
days.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.420
It eventually dawned on Lim that even if they
did know the ship hadn’t come in yet, no

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.720
one was going to come looking for it under
such dangerous, war-time conditions.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.120
He decided that he would take matters into
his own hands; if he could survive long enough,

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.610
maybe the raft would take the current and
float to land by itself.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.220
In order to survive, he fashioned a rain-catching
receptacle out of the canvas from the roof

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.820
and his life jacket.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.250
He made a fishing hook out of the wire from
the flashlight and jagged edges of the tins

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.250
of biscuits.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.170
For bait, initially he used bits of his hardtack.

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.420
Beyond fishing, he decided that he needed
to find a way to catch the other animal he

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.720
had seen on a constant basis while he floated
– seagulls.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.830
To do this, he came up with a little trickery.

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.440
He took the seaweed from the bottom of the
raft, matted it down, and shaped it until

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.760
it looked like a nest.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.800
Then, he let a fish rot next to the “nest.”

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.640
Soon enough, a seagull swooped in and Lim
went after it, eventually breaking its neck

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.950
(after suffering a few cuts from the bird
in the process).

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.490
He then sucked the blood out of the bird,
and dried the remaining flesh out with saltwater,

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.840
making perfect seagull jerky.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.450
Because he was a poor swimmer, he knotted
one end of hemp rope to his wrist and the

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.100
other to the raft, in case he fell in.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.120
By day 60, he was confident enough that he
began to swim twice a day in order to keep

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.930
his physical strength up.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.610
Things were going as well as can be expected
until the second month when a storm nearly

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.300
destroyed his raft.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.400
He survived and was able to repair the craft,
though he lost his water and food supply.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.080
Beyond storms and the constant difficulty
of acquiring food and drinkable water, sharks

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.640
were also a problem.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.470
They were attracted to the remaining blood
of the fish that he gutted and hung on lines

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:35.670
to dry the meat.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.220
The sharks would often surround his boat,
even occasionally ramming the raft.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:46.690
But while sharks are predators looking for
food, so was Lim.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:51.170
He crafted a sharp hook out of a nail he managed
to pry from the raft; the next shark that

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:55.410
came close after he’d done this, he managed
to hook and pull up into the boat.

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.610
A fight ensued on the small craft, but Lim
ultimately won out, supplying him food for

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.720
days, including a Hanian delicacy – dried
out shark fins.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.380
Poon-LimAnd so he subsisted remarkably well
for 133 days.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.940
He came close to rescue three times during
the ordeal- once when he was spotted by the

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.590
crew of a passing freighter, who ignored him.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.140
Lim felt it was because he was Chinese.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.139
In a second instance, he was spotted by American
airmen out on patrol.

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:25.250
They even flew low to investigate, but ultimately
no rescue resulted.

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.110
This may have been because very shortly after
they spotted him, a storm came up and moved

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.180
Lim’s raft far from where he had been when
the planes flew over.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.630
In yet another instance, a German submarine
spotted him and surfaced, but ultimately decided

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.230
to leave him to his fate.

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:42.420
This all came to an end when he found himself
being picked up by Brazilian fishermen on

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.140
April 5, 1943, about ten miles from shore.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:47.950
Three days later, they landed in Belem, Brazil,
a town at the mouth of the Amazon River.

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:52.350
Upon arriving in Belem, despite being relatively
healthy, all things considered, and having

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:57.010
only lost about 20 pounds during his voyage,
he spent four weeks at the local hospital.

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:00.460
When he was released, the British consul arranged
for him to go to Britain, where he was given

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.470
a British Empire Medal by King George VI.

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:08.040
The Royal Navy was so impressed by his survival
skills and story that they incorporated his

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.210
techniques into their manuals.

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:13.710
After the war, he wanted to emigrate to the
US and, despite initial difficulty due to

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:17.940
the Chinese immigration quota having been
met (this would exist in the US until 1965),

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:22.510
he was eventually allowed into the United
States thanks to special legislation written

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:25.800
by Democratic Senator Walter Magnuson of Washington.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.610
Poon Lim lived to the age of 72, passing away
in 1991.

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:35.210
To this day, he still holds the official record
for longest time for a lone person to survive

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:37.680
being adrift at sea in a life raft.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:42.270
When told this in 1943, Poon Lim responded,
“I hope no one will ever have to break that

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:42.840
record.”
