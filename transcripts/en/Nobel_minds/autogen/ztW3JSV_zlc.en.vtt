00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840
well if there were many points it was

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850
well if there were many points it was
 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.269
well if there were many points it was
not just a single point first of all you

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279
not just a single point first of all you
 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.280
not just a single point first of all you
have to get the idea that you can do

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290
have to get the idea that you can do
 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.690
have to get the idea that you can do
something about the light microscope

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700
something about the light microscope
 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.490
something about the light microscope
because people believe that this would

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500
because people believe that this would
 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.650
because people believe that this would
not be possible and it was fully

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660
not be possible and it was fully
 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.379
not be possible and it was fully
accepted in the 20th century and so I

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389
accepted in the 20th century and so I
 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.380
accepted in the 20th century and so I
think the first point was when I had

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390
think the first point was when I had
 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.990
think the first point was when I had
this kind of conviction evolving in me

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000
this kind of conviction evolving in me
 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.660
this kind of conviction evolving in me
that there must be a way to do something

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670
that there must be a way to do something
 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.759
that there must be a way to do something
about this diffraction whereas it is

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769
about this diffraction whereas it is
 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.730
about this diffraction whereas it is
called then I was convinced continuing

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740
called then I was convinced continuing
 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.279
called then I was convinced continuing
and then the second big event was when I

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289
and then the second big event was when I
 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.430
and then the second big event was when I
had the first concrete idea actually had

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440
had the first concrete idea actually had
 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.340
had the first concrete idea actually had
it when I was a postdoc in over in

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350
it when I was a postdoc in over in
 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.280
it when I was a postdoc in over in
Finland and I realized that you can

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290
Finland and I realized that you can
 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.950
Finland and I realized that you can
separate fluorescent molecules that are

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960
separate fluorescent molecules that are
 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.650
separate fluorescent molecules that are
closer together than this 200 nanometer

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660
closer together than this 200 nanometer
 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.840
closer together than this 200 nanometer
barrier by turning them on and off

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850
barrier by turning them on and off
 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.840
barrier by turning them on and off
playing playing with the brightness of

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850
playing playing with the brightness of
 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.229
playing playing with the brightness of
them and I discovered that you can use a

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239
them and I discovered that you can use a
 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.060
them and I discovered that you can use a
phenomenon which is called stimulated

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070
phenomenon which is called stimulated
 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.979
phenomenon which is called stimulated
emission and it's phenomenal similar

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989
emission and it's phenomenal similar
 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.720
emission and it's phenomenal similar
emission does nothing but keep molecules

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730
emission does nothing but keep molecules
 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.139
emission does nothing but keep molecules
dark shut shuts the molecules off and so

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149
dark shut shuts the molecules off and so
 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.640
dark shut shuts the molecules off and so
I used this phenomenon of stimulated

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650
I used this phenomenon of stimulated
 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.539
I used this phenomenon of stimulated
emission to shot molecules off turn them

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549
emission to shot molecules off turn them
 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.140
emission to shot molecules off turn them
off to see the daybreak one and this was

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150
off to see the daybreak one and this was
 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.750
off to see the daybreak one and this was
the second really important event in

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760
the second really important event in
 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.570
the second really important event in
this journey the third important event

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580
this journey the third important event
 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.219
this journey the third important event
was when I realized that this is doable

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229
was when I realized that this is doable
 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.249
was when I realized that this is doable
you can really do it in practice this

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259
you can really do it in practice this
 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.960
you can really do it in practice this
phenomenon of turning off really works

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970
phenomenon of turning off really works
 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.080
phenomenon of turning off really works
the way i dissipated and the force event

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090
the way i dissipated and the force event
 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.420
the way i dissipated and the force event
was when we got the first pictures that

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430
was when we got the first pictures that
 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.789
was when we got the first pictures that
demonstrated yes you can see details

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799
demonstrated yes you can see details
 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.190
demonstrated yes you can see details
much much smaller scales because you

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200
much much smaller scales because you
 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.109
much much smaller scales because you
can't keep things dark and if you have

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119
can't keep things dark and if you have
 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.609
can't keep things dark and if you have
two things that you cannot separate

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619
two things that you cannot separate
 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.980
two things that you cannot separate
normally because they hit at the same

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990
normally because they hit at the same
 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.100
normally because they hit at the same
time with big blob of light you turn

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110
time with big blob of light you turn
 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.260
time with big blob of light you turn
this one off to see this one then you

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270
this one off to see this one then you
 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.840
this one off to see this one then you
turn this one off to see that one and

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850
turn this one off to see that one and
 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.149
turn this one off to see that one and
that was as it turned out the

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159
that was as it turned out the
 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.859
that was as it turned out the
fundamental discovery and is that you

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869
fundamental discovery and is that you
 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.399
fundamental discovery and is that you
can see now in principle down to the

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409
can see now in principle down to the
 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.440
can see now in principle down to the
molecular scale and in practice now we

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450
molecular scale and in practice now we
 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.600
molecular scale and in practice now we
are about 20 nanometers 39 minutes

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610
are about 20 nanometers 39 minutes
 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.460
are about 20 nanometers 39 minutes
it's clear that the resolution will

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470
it's clear that the resolution will
 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.660
it's clear that the resolution will
increase third and further if you

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670
increase third and further if you
 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.510
increase third and further if you
perfect this say state transition that's

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520
perfect this say state transition that's
 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.880
perfect this say state transition that's
a technical term of going from a bright

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890
a technical term of going from a bright
 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.040
a technical term of going from a bright
or dark stick or between two different

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050
or dark stick or between two different
 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.500
