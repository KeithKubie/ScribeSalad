like to know how was dark matter first

00:00:06.579 --> 00:00:06.589
like to know how was dark matter first
 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:09.980
like to know how was dark matter first
detected it how do we detect it what

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990
detected it how do we detect it what
 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.669
detected it how do we detect it what
what are methods for determining Jim

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679
what are methods for determining Jim
 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.070
what are methods for determining Jim
dark matter when was it first detected

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080
dark matter when was it first detected
 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.170

well astronomers began to suspect that

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180
well astronomers began to suspect that
 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.099
well astronomers began to suspect that
existed

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109
existed
 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.470
existed
many many years ago I think back in the

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480
many many years ago I think back in the
 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.060
many many years ago I think back in the
1930s because it was already recognized

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070
1930s because it was already recognized
 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.620
1930s because it was already recognized
that we couldn't quite understand how

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630
that we couldn't quite understand how
 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.349
that we couldn't quite understand how
stars orbit around our own galaxy and

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359
stars orbit around our own galaxy and
 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.200
stars orbit around our own galaxy and
orbit in other galaxies it seems that

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210
orbit in other galaxies it seems that
 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.760
orbit in other galaxies it seems that
there's material out there that has

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770
there's material out there that has
 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.360
there's material out there that has
gravity that we cannot detect so when

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370
gravity that we cannot detect so when
 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.220
gravity that we cannot detect so when
you see how many stars make up a galaxy

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230
you see how many stars make up a galaxy
 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.200
you see how many stars make up a galaxy
you can estimate how how massive they

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210
you can estimate how how massive they
 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.299
you can estimate how how massive they
are you calculate how much gravity they

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309
are you calculate how much gravity they
 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.610
are you calculate how much gravity they
make and it's not enough so we knew a

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620
make and it's not enough so we knew a
 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.930
make and it's not enough so we knew a
long time ago if something was the

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940
long time ago if something was the
 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.630
long time ago if something was the
matter now that became much more

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640
matter now that became much more
 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.990
matter now that became much more
definite evidence about thirty years ago

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000
definite evidence about thirty years ago
 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.790
definite evidence about thirty years ago
and since then we've even got more kinds

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800
and since then we've even got more kinds
 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.950
and since then we've even got more kinds
through measurements of the

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960
through measurements of the
 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.750
through measurements of the
gravitational forces in clusters of

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760
gravitational forces in clusters of
 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.569
gravitational forces in clusters of
galaxies and some clusters of galaxies

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579
galaxies and some clusters of galaxies
 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.429
galaxies and some clusters of galaxies
have enough gravitational force to bend

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439
have enough gravitational force to bend
 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.250
have enough gravitational force to bend
light from more distant galaxies and so

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260
light from more distant galaxies and so
 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.380
light from more distant galaxies and so
we see distorted images and because of

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390
we see distorted images and because of
 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.510
we see distorted images and because of
this we can determine the mass of the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520
this we can determine the mass of the
 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.060
this we can determine the mass of the
galaxy of galaxies and again we find

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070
galaxy of galaxies and again we find
 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.280
galaxy of galaxies and again we find
that there are galaxies which are much

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290
that there are galaxies which are much
 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.649
that there are galaxies which are much
more massive than we can account for by

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659
more massive than we can account for by
 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.539
more massive than we can account for by
looking at the ordinary matter that's in

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549
looking at the ordinary matter that's in
 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.810
looking at the ordinary matter that's in
them gaseous material and stars so the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820
them gaseous material and stars so the
 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.179
them gaseous material and stars so the
upshot is we've known for a long time

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189
upshot is we've known for a long time
 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.580
upshot is we've known for a long time
that something is strange out there we

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590
that something is strange out there we
 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.980
that something is strange out there we
even see in the pattern of spots in the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990
even see in the pattern of spots in the
 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.719
even see in the pattern of spots in the
cosmic microwave radiation and the big

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729
cosmic microwave radiation and the big
 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.850
cosmic microwave radiation and the big
bang with radiation that those spots

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860
bang with radiation that those spots
 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.770
bang with radiation that those spots
can't be explained unless we imagine

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780
can't be explained unless we imagine
 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.020
can't be explained unless we imagine
that there is a lot of dark matter out

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030
that there is a lot of dark matter out
 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.999
that there is a lot of dark matter out
there that is much more abundant maybe

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009
there that is much more abundant maybe
 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.490
there that is much more abundant maybe
five or ten times as abundant as the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500
five or ten times as abundant as the
 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.700
five or ten times as abundant as the
matter that we're made of so that's the

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710
matter that we're made of so that's the
 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.460
matter that we're made of so that's the
astronomical method now we are hoping

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470
astronomical method now we are hoping
 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.139
astronomical method now we are hoping
that someone will actually find a

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149
that someone will actually find a
 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.580
that someone will actually find a
particle of dark matter in a laboratory

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590
particle of dark matter in a laboratory
 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.950
particle of dark matter in a laboratory
one of these days and we have two ways

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960
one of these days and we have two ways
 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.929
one of these days and we have two ways
that this might happen one is that a

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939
that this might happen one is that a
 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.550
that this might happen one is that a
Dark Matter particle might actually

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560
Dark Matter particle might actually
 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.459
Dark Matter particle might actually
interact with a object detector that we

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469
interact with a object detector that we
 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.100
interact with a object detector that we
might build and my friends in this

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110
might build and my friends in this
 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.600
might build and my friends in this
business say it could happen in ten or

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610
business say it could happen in ten or
 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.210
business say it could happen in ten or
twenty years the other way is that maybe

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220
twenty years the other way is that maybe
 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.979
twenty years the other way is that maybe
we'll make a particle of dark matter in

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989
we'll make a particle of dark matter in
 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.680
we'll make a particle of dark matter in
a collision experiment as

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690
a collision experiment as
 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.650
a collision experiment as
large hadron collider and this Dark

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660
large hadron collider and this Dark
 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.270
large hadron collider and this Dark
Matter particle would disappear without

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280
Matter particle would disappear without
 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.070
Matter particle would disappear without
a trace and it would take

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080
a trace and it would take
 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.680
a trace and it would take
however with it some matter sorry it

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690
however with it some matter sorry it
 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.510
however with it some matter sorry it
would take away with it some energy and

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520
would take away with it some energy and
 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.000
would take away with it some energy and
some momentum and if this would be true

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010
some momentum and if this would be true
 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.710
some momentum and if this would be true
then we would say well we put stuff in

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720
then we would say well we put stuff in
 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.540
then we would say well we put stuff in
and we didn't get enough back out there

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550
and we didn't get enough back out there
 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.550
and we didn't get enough back out there
must be a Dark Matter particle that

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560
must be a Dark Matter particle that
 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.750
must be a Dark Matter particle that
escaped from our chamber without

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760
escaped from our chamber without
 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.230
escaped from our chamber without
noticing so we have these many ways to

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240
noticing so we have these many ways to
 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.230
noticing so we have these many ways to
try to get at the Dark Matter nature but

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240
try to get at the Dark Matter nature but
 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.470
try to get at the Dark Matter nature but
none of them have succeeded yet
