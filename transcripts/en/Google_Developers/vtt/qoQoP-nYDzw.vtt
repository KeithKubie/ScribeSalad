IRE ADERINOKUN: Hi, everyone.

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.660
My name is Ire Aderinokun,
and I'm a front end developer

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.580
based here in Lagos, Nigeria.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.620
I spent most of my
childhood here in Lagos.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.990
I actually went to a primary
school just down the road

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.490
from where I live.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.260
Most of the pictures
you find of me

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
are just with some kind
of weird, angry face.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.700
Like, why am I angry here?

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.740
I'm about to eat cake.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.600
I really love being a
front end developer,

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.240
particularly working on the
web, because the web is just

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.640
such an amazing platform.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.328
You can reach pretty
much anyone, anywhere.

00:00:30.328 --> 00:00:32.119
And it's because of
the openness of the web

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.420
that I was able to learn how to
be a developer without having

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.440
to go and study
computer science.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.150
I also do a lot of
speaking, and I've

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.420
spoken at a ton of
events across the world.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.020
But it's also the reason why I
became Nigeria's first and only

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.880
female Google Developer Expert.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.000
I actually got to meet
Sundar in person last year.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.340
So he came to Nigeria and
I got to speak with him

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.370
about the work I do
as a GDE, and also I

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.260
got to show him a
real progressive web

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.270
app that I built.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.780
So last year it was my
first time at Google I/O,

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.220
and it was a really amazing
but overwhelming experience,

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.500
because there's
just so much to do.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.840
And this year, I really
want to take advantage

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.720
of being there in person
and meet as many people

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.190
as I possibly can.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.310
And also, of course, attend
as many web sessions as I can.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.360
