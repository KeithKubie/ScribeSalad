What we have over the criminal is the criminal actually thinks he's destroyed.

10
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.180
All the evidence is never oldest, right?

11
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.020
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

12
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.100
<v 1>ever, ever, ever. Never.</v>

13
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.060
This is Lou Garcia originally retired from New York city fire department as the

14
00:00:48.061 --> 00:00:48.990
chief fire Marshall,

15
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.410
so I've spent 25 years of my life looking at fires and investigating the causes

16
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.840
<v 3>before. How many pairs do you think you've seen? Both</v>

17
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.020
<v 1>tens of thousands of fires. You'll have seen 10 years of that. Absolutely.</v>

18
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.220
You'll, you'll hear yourself. Yeah.

19
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.840
When he tells me his story there was this a true story?

20
00:01:07.841 --> 00:01:09.430
I'm not going to get too many details about it,

21
00:01:09.431 --> 00:01:12.490
but there was a fire in an area of New York City who was in an apartment

22
00:01:12.491 --> 00:01:15.490
building in the south Bronx. As I pulled up to this building,

23
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.260
the fire was already over with Lou Gatto.

24
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.900
There were people in the street and we're questioning people. People are saying,

25
00:01:22.901 --> 00:01:26.320
well, in the apartment where the fire was, there was this brave guy.

26
00:01:26.321 --> 00:01:30.400
Somehow he'd gotten in there and he was pouring water trying to get the fire

27
00:01:30.401 --> 00:01:33.310
out. This guy was really something, you know, and he's, and he's,

28
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.680
he's the hero right now. Everybody's telling me what a hero he is.

29
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.950
Everything that we're saying in the street about this man was wrong.

30
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.210
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

31
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.100
<v 1>so he walks into the apartment, he looks around,</v>

32
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.540
he knows right away where the fire started. Now how, how well,

33
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:51.530
you just look at the fire pattern

34
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.640
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

35
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.040
<v 1>and you could tell that the fire started first of all,</v>

36
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.460
in the bedroom with a mattress mattress.

37
00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.660
The mattress now matches go up. If you put a match to it. Really? I mean,

38
00:02:03.661 --> 00:02:05.930
don't you have to put like gasoline on the mattress? No, no, no.

39
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.040
You just put a match onto a match mattress and it will catch fire. Yes.

40
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.520
If you hold a bit longer. Yeah.

41
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.490
And he also knew that the mattress had been placed upright against the wall.

42
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.650
You could tell by the five pounds that was standing on it. Wow.

43
00:02:16.651 --> 00:02:20.190
He can even know what position the mattress was in. Yes, absolutely. Believe me.

44
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.390
So he meets the woman whose apartment this is, she shows up and he says,

45
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.480
there's so, do you know this fellow who is putting out the fire? She's, yes.

46
00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:31.170
As a matter of fact, I do. It just so happens that you used to live with me,

47
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.730
but I kicked him out and he still had a key, by the way.

48
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.360
And she knows, says, I have a new boyfriend.

49
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:39.403
<v 3>Right?</v>

50
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.380
<v 1>So Garcia naturally goes and finds the hero. All right,</v>

51
00:02:44.381 --> 00:02:49.120
so now I'm questioning this up. I said, by the way, did you buy that mattress?

52
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.500
And he said, yes, I did. And you weren't sleeping anymore with someone else.

53
00:02:53.501 --> 00:02:55.870
Could be in the mattress in your place. I says, yeah,

54
00:02:55.871 --> 00:02:59.550
we should have the boyfriend. I said, boy, I'd be pissed. How of the course,

55
00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.340
like four or $500 you said no more than that. It was like 800 off. I said,

56
00:03:03.341 --> 00:03:07.570
so now she is screwing somebody else on the mattress you bought.

57
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.150
I would be pissed. I said, you know, if it was me, if I were in your place,

58
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.930
I would want this mattress to burn. I was probably standing on end.

59
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.150
I would take matches, matches, and I would put it to the, to the mattress.

60
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.940
That's what I would do and in fact,

61
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.610
I'm an expert on fires and I know that's what you did. You really did do it.

62
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.560
Yeah, you can talk about it. I don't blame you.

63
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.180
I mean at least you tried to put it out,

64
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.870
but that'll work in your favor in court. And he looks at me. He says, well,

65
00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:42.280
you're not so smart. I said, wine. He goes, I used the lighter.

66
00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:43.723
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

67
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.010
<v 5>Oh, you're right. I'm not</v>

68
00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.830
[inaudible].

69
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.650
<v 4>Okay, so that was an easy one. We're going to have some harder ones coming up.</v>

70
00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.890
Yup. Point is the whole hour. We're going to be addressing the same problem.

71
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.270
We'll walk into one situation after another and discover that something is not

72
00:04:05.271 --> 00:04:09.590
right here. That's right. Something's not right with my son. What do I do?

73
00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.440
Something's not right with my pancreas. What do I do?

74
00:04:12.441 --> 00:04:13.970
Something's not right with the very phrase.

75
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.850
Something is not right because it presumes that I know what's right and maybe I

76
00:04:16.851 --> 00:04:18.860
don't have we confused you enough? Well,

77
00:04:18.861 --> 00:04:23.570
there's a whole lot of abnormal things coming your way. This is Radiolab.

78
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.690
I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert Quilt. Stay with us.

79
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.680
<v 7>Okay, so this first story is about, uh,</v>

80
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.850
delivering a diagnosis comes to us from producer Lulo Koski.

81
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.050
It's about two doctors. You start with that phrase,

82
00:04:40.051 --> 00:04:45.051
something's not right here and end up going on a crazy adventure after a cure

83
00:04:45.391 --> 00:04:50.260
for a deadly disease, which is that pancreatic cancer. Oh, that's not good.

84
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.220
It is. Look the most deadly cancer.

85
00:04:52.221 --> 00:04:56.780
This is the one that people have nightmares about. Why you mean it's deadly?

86
00:04:56.781 --> 00:05:01.370
How like, well, if it's rare but it's deadly, it's the one where you know you,

87
00:05:01.371 --> 00:05:03.890
something's wrong. You'd go to the doctor and they say,

88
00:05:03.891 --> 00:05:08.330
you have six months to live. Wow. Is it that fast? It, it usually is that fast.

89
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.850
Um, how'd you find this out? I found this up because my friend Amy, um, said,

90
00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.250
I've got a friend named Dr. Terry Brenton all.

91
00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.790
She made a big scientific discovery and you should go to her

92
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.350
<v 6>press conference. This will be amazing. Go. And I go to the press,</v>

93
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.990
male friends.

94
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.270
<v 7>It's just a tremendous pleasure to be here today.</v>

95
00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:31.660
Press conferences are kind of never amazing and I hope to one unfold a story for

96
00:05:31.821 --> 00:05:33.830
you. I hope it will capture your attention.

97
00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.810
It's a fascinating story and I heard this incredible story about 10 years ago.

98
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.400
One morning, a 40 year old guy came into my clinic,

99
00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.270
Mr x just finishing mine, very healthy looking.

100
00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.280
And he comes into my clinic and he says,

101
00:05:49.281 --> 00:05:51.110
I'm worried I'm going to get pancreatic cancer,

102
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.900
that I'm going to get the curse in my family. It was like,

103
00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.820
good gooby what are you talking about? And he said, well, in my family,

104
00:06:01.821 --> 00:06:03.800
my father got pancreatic cancer,

105
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:08.570
my grandfather and my four uncles and my three cousins. Wow.

106
00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:13.040
Four uncles, three cousins, father, grandfather, all die of pancreatic cancer.

107
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.050
And this guy was sure he was next in line.

108
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.770
His uncles and his father looked like the healthiest people in the world.

109
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.410
Six months later they're dead. He was terrified.

110
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.800
He came to me as a act of desperation.

111
00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.950
I mean, it's not a feeling, I guess they're not. Maybe I know or you know.

112
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.110
But what happened when you walked in was like Terri,

113
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.010
she knew exactly how he felt. You can't even process anything.

114
00:06:37.011 --> 00:06:41.660
You're just like almost in a trance. She'd gone through that before,

115
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.880
completely and utterly alone.

116
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.990
She was diagnosed with breast cancer when she was 34 it's a sense of falling.

117
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.260
It's truly a sense of falling.

118
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.280
The world slides away from you and you literally,

119
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.420
it's almost like it disappears from underneath you. When she got the news,

120
00:06:59.421 --> 00:07:02.090
the first thing her doctor did, he was a friend of hers,

121
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.370
pulled out the whiskey and put it on the table.

122
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.650
<v 0>She had a shower, which I was like, thank God he did that.</v>

123
00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:14.290
I'm not good. Quite honestly, we're gonna fight this name.

124
00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:19.000
You are not alone. That's all I needed to hear.

125
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.260
<v 7>And so when she was sitting there with, with patient x, she know exactly.</v>

126
00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.970
<v 0>They would just say, you have to step forward.</v>

127
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.640
You can step back and just [inaudible]

128
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:31.810
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

129
00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:35.050
<v 7>I was young then and so I felt, look,</v>

130
00:07:35.051 --> 00:07:39.550
I fixed this thing. I'll take that on. I can help you.

131
00:07:39.551 --> 00:07:42.280
I don't care how horrible it's what happens next.

132
00:07:42.281 --> 00:07:46.360
So Terry runs back to her office and office, she shares with another doctor,

133
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:51.220
Mary Bronner. I'm Mary Brunner, I'm a pathologist. So I was like, Mary,

134
00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:54.040
Mary says you won't believe this. This guy, Mr x,

135
00:07:54.041 --> 00:07:58.280
walk into my office and he has this outrageous, this crazy family histories.

136
00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:01.030
Horrible problem was floored.

137
00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:05.230
Terry had never heard that pancreatic cancer could be inherited and families,

138
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:08.020
they'd never heard of anything like that. Terry comes in and she's like,

139
00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:11.920
I've got to help this guy. I have to figure out what's making these people sick.

140
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.760
And Mary, I need your help. And, and Mary, what did she say? Well,

141
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:20.290
she's a pathologist. So what does it mean to be a pathologist? Well, she's,

142
00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:23.410
she's the person who physically does the diagnosis.

143
00:08:23.411 --> 00:08:27.460
When your surgeon does an operation on you or your internist takes a biopsy of

144
00:08:27.461 --> 00:08:28.294
you,

145
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:33.360
they send that tissue to me and I make it into glass slides to look at under the

146
00:08:35.951 --> 00:08:36.521
microscopes.

147
00:08:36.521 --> 00:08:41.320
So she spends her time looking at tiny pieces of Terry's patients,

148
00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:42.900
smeared on little slots. I,

149
00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:47.680
I love the emotional distance that you have in pathology. You're, you know,

150
00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:52.600
a step removed from the misery and it makes it so much easier

151
00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:57.510
<v 0>for me to handle it. Does she interact with patients? Almost never.</v>

152
00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:01.950
Terry was right up against in Missouri and she was just relaying the story to

153
00:09:01.951 --> 00:09:02.784
me.

154
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:07.050
But I can sit very comfortably at my microscope and be very objective and just

155
00:09:07.051 --> 00:09:11.070
look at the tissue and decide where the cancer is because I don't know these

156
00:09:11.071 --> 00:09:13.980
patients. So you're like, I gotta go do this.

157
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.650
Come with me as she usually does.

158
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:20.310
How did you decide that Mary should join you?

159
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.060
She's my science partner. That's it.

160
00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:25.980
And I have been the cat.

161
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:30.240
I usually [inaudible] so they decided in order to help this guy,

162
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.280
they need to go to where his family is.

163
00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:36.100
We drove across the mountains of Washington state.

164
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:41.560
[inaudible] dry. They wanted to get the family together.

165
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:44.290
What it means to treat Zach. They make them draw their blood,

166
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:48.100
look at their blood to see if there's something in there that's making all these

167
00:09:48.101 --> 00:09:49.770
people sick. And

168
00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:53.510
<v 8>we arrive at the little tiny town in eastern Washington,</v>

169
00:09:53.511 --> 00:09:56.270
a little town called Elma. And then they didn't even have, they're so small,

170
00:09:56.271 --> 00:10:01.070
they don't have a single medical facility. So in order to do the blood drop,

171
00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:06.220
we basically had to use the subway sandwich shop in town.

172
00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.830
Why, why subway would have great sandwiches.

173
00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:13.030
One of the family members worked there and asked the boss if,

174
00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:16.760
if the family could all come and these doctors could come and draw their blood

175
00:10:16.761 --> 00:10:19.490
and could we use the shop as the meeting, right.

176
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:23.440
<v 0>All I remember is walking in and thinking this is small.</v>

177
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:29.790
So we've set up a little corner booth with our box of blood drawing supplies and

178
00:10:31.391 --> 00:10:36.010
they sort of came in waves, uncles, cousins, nieces and nephews.

179
00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.650
And they brought their kids. He's filled that subway sandwich shop.

180
00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.513
How many in all?

181
00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:43.180
About 30 it was funny cause they hadn't seen each other a long time are like,

182
00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.750
oh my God, see you in 10 years. It's like, wow,

183
00:10:46.751 --> 00:10:48.940
you guys only live like five miles a day.

184
00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:54.540
We'd bring them over to our little tiny booth and we didn't introduce ourselves.

185
00:10:54.541 --> 00:10:59.130
I'm Terry Brenton or Mary Brian or GI doctor or amnesty surgical oncologist.

186
00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:04.110
The purpose of our work today is that we are trying to find the cancer gene that

187
00:11:04.111 --> 00:11:08.580
causes the disease in your family. With your permission today,

188
00:11:08.581 --> 00:11:12.510
we'd like to take a small blood sample. It's about the size of two tablespoons.

189
00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:15.300
You will not get any results back from this blood test.

190
00:11:15.301 --> 00:11:19.530
I want to be really clear about that. It's all for us to try and find the gene.

191
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.770
I can't even promise that. We'll definitely find that gene.

192
00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:27.990
Here's your sandwich and now me have some blood.

193
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.700
<v 8>As we were waiting for most of the family to show up,</v>

194
00:11:32.701 --> 00:11:36.720
Terry and I were sitting in this one booth with one of the family members who we

195
00:11:36.721 --> 00:11:40.620
had already identified as having the disease. He was young,

196
00:11:40.621 --> 00:11:45.621
he was in his thirties and I like it think was you have a time bomb,

197
00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:49.640
<v 6>okay</v>

198
00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:53.840
<v 8>inside your body [inaudible]</v>

199
00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:00.850
and then this little boy comes running into the subway sandwich shop just like

200
00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:06.360
runs up to this guy that we're talking to this patient to family x. Well his,

201
00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:11.370
his arms around his daddy's neck and kisses him and Andy and all I could think

202
00:12:11.381 --> 00:12:14.170
was, oh my God, this beautiful little child,

203
00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:17.020
he has 50% chance.

204
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:22.440
Okay I in this hideous disease and I was so upset about that.

205
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:27.730
I was just so torn apart inside but I couldn't really, you know,

206
00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:33.220
start balling right there that wouldn't have been professional.

207
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:36.370
They held it together until we were driving home and,

208
00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.590
and I was telling Terry how I'll say it,

209
00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:43.330
I was about that little boy and how it just really hit me and she said,

210
00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:48.020
Oh hey, don't worry about him. He's adopted.

211
00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:56.440
You have to remember Mary doesn't come face to face with patients very often.

212
00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:00.980
It's not something a pathologist does very frequently.

213
00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:02.683
Pathologists have the,

214
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:05.420
I don't even know if I want to tell you this is sort of like [inaudible]

215
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.340
<v 7>yes. The black side of pathology.</v>

216
00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:14.770
Black humor to get you through or yeah, really black humor, you know,

217
00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:16.660
we'll say things like, um,

218
00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:21.160
somebody better tell this patient not to buy the big tube of toothpaste.

219
00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:29.810
Terry's laughing, but that's why we do it because it's so horrible.

220
00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:33.200
I spent an afternoon with Mary going through slides,

221
00:13:33.201 --> 00:13:37.820
looking at pancreatic tissue, three trying to figure out like, you know,

222
00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:41.420
if this person has cancer or not. Dozens of patients.

223
00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:44.300
Now this is another case with a terrible,

224
00:13:44.301 --> 00:13:48.590
terrible case and that's when I really kind of got it. Like why she'd want to

225
00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:55.190
keep herself distant. Oh, this cancer is even worse than the last one.

226
00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:59.960
This person, if they can shit,

227
00:13:59.961 --> 00:14:04.940
go to a beautiful place on planet earth and just stay there

228
00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:11.200
till it's over. Well, what happened after subway though? I mean,

229
00:14:11.201 --> 00:14:14.320
were they able to, you know, figure out what's causing this thing? Well,

230
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:18.760
once they got the blood, they worked on it for about five years, five years.

231
00:14:18.761 --> 00:14:20.590
You know, they went chromosome by chromosome,

232
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:22.630
collaborated with all these other researchers.

233
00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:27.280
And at the end of the day they discovered that the thing that causes familial

234
00:14:27.281 --> 00:14:30.010
pancreatic cancer comes down to a mistake.

235
00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:34.750
One little mistake on one one molecule molecule.

236
00:14:34.751 --> 00:14:38.200
I know it comes down to one tiny molecule. Yes.

237
00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.330
So our discovery is, uh,

238
00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:45.430
we're titling it pallet and mutation causes familial pancreatic cancer and

239
00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.490
suggests a new cancer mechanism. So they write a paper.

240
00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:51.650
I have a press conference of all I want to acknowledge and celebrate.

241
00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:55.960
[inaudible]

242
00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:59.340
<v 0>so in the end, do they, do they find a cure? Well, no, not yet.</v>

243
00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:03.580
They're working on it. Can they at least, um, test for it now? Well,

244
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:07.940
they can test, but it's what, you know,

245
00:15:07.941 --> 00:15:10.910
most pancreatic cancer isn't hereditary like this.

246
00:15:10.911 --> 00:15:13.580
This is actually a small subset.

247
00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:22.720
So where does that leave Mary and Terry? I mean, where are they now?

248
00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:27.340
Mary's really glad the research phase

249
00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:33.670
is over and that she doesn't have to be with patients anymore. Terry

250
00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:38.080
knows they have more work to do and they can't really give up,

251
00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:41.530
but she's really tired and thinks about it a lot. You know,

252
00:15:41.531 --> 00:15:45.280
the stakes are so high in this eye. Sometimes it's almost unbearable.

253
00:15:45.281 --> 00:15:49.350
Sometimes I think I should quit. Yeah, totally.

254
00:15:49.351 --> 00:15:51.840
I've talked to Mary about it, but you know what?

255
00:15:51.841 --> 00:15:55.190
I know she'll never stop doing it. Right. Terry?

256
00:15:59.180 --> 00:15:59.260
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

257
00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:00.820
<v 0>sometimes it's just too much</v>

258
00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:03.640
<v 6>too.</v>

259
00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:07.370
<v 0>Mary and I love to garden. So sometimes you know,</v>

260
00:16:07.371 --> 00:16:11.780
we think about being landscape architects and then the worst thing that does is,

261
00:16:11.781 --> 00:16:16.130
oh, I killed the bush. They were like, you lose, or you killed the bush.

262
00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.440
<v 6>[inaudible] [inaudible] you</v>

263
00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.670
<v 0>thanks to the little Kelsey for reporting that story.</v>

264
00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:41.430
The next story concerns a dad and his little boy.

265
00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:44.370
There's something about this little boy that is not quite right,

266
00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.890
but there's something about the dad that doesn't want to say.

267
00:16:46.891 --> 00:16:51.300
So that's coming up in about a minute. I'm Jed Abu Rod and I'm Robert Krulwich.

268
00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.040
Radiolab will continue.
