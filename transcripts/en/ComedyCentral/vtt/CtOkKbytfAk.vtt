all of us would do.

00:01:10.803 --> 00:01:14.607
any kid should ever assume,

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:15.909
ever in their life,

they could shit themselves.

00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:22.148
Think about that.
Like, as a kid,

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:25.084
why would you ever assume
that's an outcome?

00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:27.586
Why would you ever assume
that's even a possibility?

00:01:27.586 --> 00:01:29.956
The only way you would know that
for sure

00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:32.024
is if an adult told you,

00:01:32.024 --> 00:01:35.161

when you're 11, 12,

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:57.576
you start caring
what people think.

00:02:57.576 --> 00:02:59.679
It's really the moment in time

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:01.547
where everything
becomes horrific

00:03:04.183 --> 00:03:07.920

I'm just sitting in the car.

00:03:20.766 --> 00:03:23.035

"If I fart a little bit,

00:03:36.582 --> 00:03:38.384

That's the world
we truly live in.

00:04:10.016 --> 00:04:12.118
And I now know that.

00:04:12.118 --> 00:04:15.855

fart in your car

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.430
just grasp the concept that
that's a thing.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.366
You didn't know that.
You're like, "Aah!

00:04:42.515 --> 00:04:46.619
I had about 30 yards between
the car and the front door

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:49.388
into the gymnastics place.

00:04:49.388 --> 00:04:52.225
And that's what we'll call it:
the gymnastics place.

00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:55.560
Those are the words I've chosen
for this story.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.362
You have 30 yards to figure out

00:04:57.362 --> 00:04:59.197
how to walk as though
it looks like

00:04:59.197 --> 00:05:01.301
you didn't just shit yourself.

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:03.368
When you first get out of
the car, you're waddling

00:05:03.368 --> 00:05:06.338
a little bit because it gives
you kind of an idea of what

00:05:06.338 --> 00:05:08.207
you're working with back there.

00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:10.543
How much did I shit,
you know what I mean?

00:05:10.543 --> 00:05:11.677
You don't know.

00:05:11.677 --> 00:05:12.979
Waddle a little bit.

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.847
Try to see.
Where are the boundaries?

00:05:15.847 --> 00:05:17.816
You can't waddle for too long,

00:05:17.816 --> 00:05:19.519
because if
someone sees you waddling,

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:22.521
their first guess is that
you've shit yourself.

00:05:22.521 --> 00:05:24.390
No one's like,
"Oh, that kid has a problem."

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.559
They're like,
"No, he probably shit himself.

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:30.930
I bet he found out the hard way
that life is real."

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.265
You have 30 yards to go
from like,

00:05:33.265 --> 00:05:37.503
"Aah" to, like, some sort of
upright, big left arm swing...

00:05:37.503 --> 00:05:40.772
"Hi, I'm a member of
the country club.

00:05:40.772 --> 00:05:42.942
"How are you?
I'm 11.

00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:48.547
[laughter]

00:05:48.547 --> 00:05:51.417
You have 30 yards
to figure out how to walk,

00:05:51.417 --> 00:05:53.385
'cause as soon as you get
through those doors,

00:05:53.385 --> 00:05:55.288
now there's people watching.

00:05:55.288 --> 00:05:56.756
And you gotta get
to the bathroom.

00:05:56.756 --> 00:05:57.756
I get in there.

00:05:57.756 --> 00:05:59.525
There's not a men's room

00:05:59.525 --> 00:06:01.060
and a women's room.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.062
There's just one bathroom

00:06:03.062 --> 00:06:06.432
that everybody has to use,
like, individually.

00:06:06.432 --> 00:06:08.267
I know, right?
Like, even then,

00:06:08.267 --> 00:06:10.102
gymnastics didn't have
the funding.

00:06:10.102 --> 00:06:12.538
It's a fucked-up situation.

00:06:12.538 --> 00:06:14.941
[laughter]

00:06:14.941 --> 00:06:16.909
I get in there.

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:18.744
And I see the bathroom.

00:06:18.744 --> 00:06:20.312
Bolt past everybody.

00:06:20.312 --> 00:06:22.548
Go in.
Close the door.

00:06:22.548 --> 00:06:23.649
Home free.

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:25.584
Here we are in the bathroom

00:06:25.584 --> 00:06:29.221
where we can really fix
this situation.

00:06:29.221 --> 00:06:31.790
What do I do first?
I get the underwear off, folks.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:32.892
I'm not an animal.

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:35.494
[laughter]

00:06:35.494 --> 00:06:39.064
I try to clean them
as best as I can in the sink.

00:06:39.064 --> 00:06:41.467
Picture what you want.

00:06:41.467 --> 00:06:43.169
I don't care.

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:46.405
Whatever you picture,
that is truly what happened.

00:06:46.405 --> 00:06:47.639
I tried to clean them
in the sink.

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:48.841
Okay,
we all have the same thought,

00:06:48.841 --> 00:06:51.477
let's go.

00:06:51.477 --> 00:06:54.980
I thought, "Maybe I can just
take these off, clean them,

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.682
throw them in the trash can."

00:06:56.682 --> 00:06:58.785
There's not, like,
a regular trash can

00:06:58.785 --> 00:07:02.421
in the bathroom that has, like,
a trash bag in it.

00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:06.325
There was one tiny little pail
trash can

00:07:06.325 --> 00:07:10.463
with zero other trash items
in it.

00:07:11.831 --> 00:07:13.665
So that's out.

00:07:13.665 --> 00:07:17.336
I'm not gonna throw my
shitty underwear in the trash,

00:07:17.336 --> 00:07:19.304
walk out,
the next person comes in.

00:07:19.304 --> 00:07:20.339
"Hey.

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:24.610
"Did you leave
your shitty underwear

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.513
in the trash?"

00:07:27.513 --> 00:07:29.849
I thought I could
flush my underwear.

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:30.849
crowd: No.

00:07:30.849 --> 00:07:31.984
- No, okay.

00:07:31.984 --> 00:07:33.619
[laughter]

00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:36.989
Little did I know how relatable
this story truly was.

00:07:36.989 --> 00:07:38.023
[laughter]

00:07:38.023 --> 00:07:40.025
Till that groan right there.

00:07:40.025 --> 00:07:42.695
"No.
You can't--hey, bro."

00:07:42.695 --> 00:07:45.063
Everyone's got a cigarette
for some reason.

00:07:45.063 --> 00:07:47.333
"No, you can't--
you can't flush that.

00:07:47.333 --> 00:07:50.569
You can't flush that.
Nah, nah."

00:07:50.569 --> 00:07:53.872
Imagine stopping up
the fucking toilet.

00:07:53.872 --> 00:07:55.408
You walk out, someone's like,

00:07:55.408 --> 00:07:58.878
"Hi, sorry, did
you try to flush your clothes?

00:07:58.878 --> 00:08:02.348
"'Cause you're dumb?

00:08:02.348 --> 00:08:04.850
"Sorry, did you wipe yourself
with your clothes

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:09.155
and then flush them?"

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:12.424
So I did
what all of us would do.

00:08:12.424 --> 00:08:14.727
I dried the underwear off
as best as I could.

00:08:14.727 --> 00:08:15.728

Shut up!

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.402
This is not easy for me!

00:08:23.402 --> 00:08:27.573
This is a part
of my 12-step program, okay?

00:08:27.573 --> 00:08:29.741
Go to a strip club
and tell this story.

00:08:29.741 --> 00:08:31.544
It's weird that
that's the first step,

00:08:31.544 --> 00:08:32.411
but it is.

00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:36.082
I go to a very "alty" AA.

00:08:36.082 --> 00:08:40.552
AAA.

00:08:40.552 --> 00:08:42.754
[laughs]

00:08:42.754 --> 00:08:45.056
I dry them off as best as I can.

00:08:45.056 --> 00:08:46.425
I grab a bunch of paper towels.

00:08:46.425 --> 00:08:48.961
I'm wringing them out.

00:08:48.961 --> 00:08:51.463
[scoffs]
Come on.

00:08:51.463 --> 00:08:53.900
And then I shove them
into my pocket.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.433
[low laughter]

00:08:55.433 --> 00:08:57.202
Yeah, I shove them in my pocket.

00:08:57.202 --> 00:08:59.104
What am I gonna fucking do?

00:08:59.104 --> 00:09:01.207
I'm trying to figure it out.
I'm 11.

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:03.709
[laughter]

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:08.780
Honestly, for 11 I'm like,
"Pretty smart kid.

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:12.284
"Hello, Harvard, Yale, others.

00:09:12.284 --> 00:09:16.121
Others I don't know of."

00:09:16.121 --> 00:09:18.390
I shove them into my pocket.

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:20.159
I get back in the car.

00:09:20.159 --> 00:09:22.761
We're on our way
to the pool party.

00:09:22.761 --> 00:09:23.896
No one in the car knows.

00:09:23.896 --> 00:09:24.997
My step-mom doesn't know.

00:09:24.997 --> 00:09:26.065
My sister doesn't know.

00:09:26.065 --> 00:09:27.433
I'm sitting there just...

00:09:27.433 --> 00:09:30.236
[high-pitched breathing]

00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:33.405
It felt like I was going
through, like, customs

00:09:33.405 --> 00:09:35.807
with a suitcase of blow.

00:09:35.807 --> 00:09:38.611
[shrieking]

00:09:38.611 --> 00:09:42.281
Oh, God,
I'm redneck Johnny Depp.

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:45.484
I get to the party.

00:09:45.484 --> 00:09:46.619
My step-mother's just
dropping me off,

00:09:46.619 --> 00:09:47.820
so she's just pulling up.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:48.821
I'm jumping out.

00:09:48.821 --> 00:09:50.323
I get out of the car.

00:09:50.323 --> 00:09:53.826
I can hear everybody
in the backyard at the pool.

00:09:53.826 --> 00:09:55.093
I go up to the front door.

00:09:55.093 --> 00:09:56.996
I knock.
No one answers.

00:09:56.996 --> 00:09:58.163
It's unlocked.

00:09:58.163 --> 00:10:00.332
I go in, thinking,

00:10:00.332 --> 00:10:01.833
now, I'm gonna have to
interact with people.

00:10:01.833 --> 00:10:03.368
Be ready.
Go inside.

00:10:03.368 --> 00:10:05.470
There's no one in the house.

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:07.339
There's a stairwell
right in front of me.

00:10:07.339 --> 00:10:08.807
I go right up it.

00:10:08.807 --> 00:10:10.042
In my head, I'm like,

00:10:10.042 --> 00:10:12.178
there's a bathroom
at the top of the stairs.

00:10:12.178 --> 00:10:13.512
I'll go in that bathroom.

00:10:13.512 --> 00:10:15.614
People will be like,
"Oh, Rory got here

00:10:15.614 --> 00:10:17.449
and he had to go
to the bathroom."

00:10:17.449 --> 00:10:21.554
Little do they know,
I already had.

00:10:23.455 --> 00:10:24.723
Still, what is the solution?

00:10:24.723 --> 00:10:26.525
That's what I'm going through.

00:10:26.525 --> 00:10:30.395
I can't leave the underwear
in the trash can here.

00:10:30.395 --> 00:10:32.831
This is even worse than
the fucking--

00:10:32.831 --> 00:10:34.500
the gymnastics place.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.702
I'm definitely not
flushing them here.

00:10:36.702 --> 00:10:39.872
I know that
outside of this bathroom,

00:10:39.872 --> 00:10:44.643
to my right is my friend
Michael's bedroom.

00:10:44.643 --> 00:10:48.881
To my left is his
younger brother's bedroom.

00:10:48.881 --> 00:10:51.917
I take the underwear
out of my pocket,

00:10:51.917 --> 00:10:53.385
I open the door,

00:10:53.385 --> 00:10:57.389
and I just fucking launch them
into the corner

00:10:57.389 --> 00:10:59.725
of his younger brother's room.
I see them.

00:10:59.725 --> 00:11:03.061
I see it hit the corner
and fall behind the bed.

00:11:03.061 --> 00:11:05.397
I walk away.
I walk away.

00:11:05.397 --> 00:11:06.665
It's not me anymore.

00:11:06.665 --> 00:11:08.868
That's no longer a part of me.

00:11:08.868 --> 00:11:10.102
That's not my issue.

00:11:10.102 --> 00:11:12.238
I don't know what you're talking
about, Officer.

00:11:12.238 --> 00:11:14.205
Why are you at this party?

00:11:14.205 --> 00:11:15.608
Why did they hire the police?

00:11:15.608 --> 00:11:18.744
That's a better question.

00:11:20.746 --> 00:11:22.581
I walk away.

00:11:22.581 --> 00:11:26.952
What's funny about this story
in my mind is that--

00:11:26.952 --> 00:11:28.720
I was on a friend's podcast

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.956
and they were telling stories
about shitting themselves.

00:11:30.956 --> 00:11:33.592
And it was only then
that it occurred to me

00:11:33.592 --> 00:11:35.761
that I even had this story.

00:11:35.761 --> 00:11:39.565
That's how powerful
the human mind is.

00:11:39.565 --> 00:11:42.267
I erased what--
everything I just told you

00:11:42.267 --> 00:11:44.936
happened exactly the way
I just told you,

00:11:44.936 --> 00:11:47.272
and I erased that from my memory

00:11:47.272 --> 00:11:50.409
so that I could continue
as a person.

00:11:50.409 --> 00:11:52.110
'Cause if I were to have gotten
hung up on that,

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:56.449
there's no way I would be
public speaking at a strip club.

00:12:00.118 --> 00:12:01.953
I had to move on.

00:12:01.953 --> 00:12:04.122
And I remembered, "Oh, my God,

00:12:04.122 --> 00:12:05.557
that did happen to me."

00:12:05.557 --> 00:12:07.959
And also, I now remember,

00:12:07.959 --> 00:12:11.930
my step-mother used to write
my name in some--

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:12.931
[laughter]

00:12:12.931 --> 00:12:14.399
Some of my underwear.

00:12:14.399 --> 00:12:16.135
How fucked up is that?

00:12:16.135 --> 00:12:17.803
Not even all of 'em.

00:12:17.803 --> 00:12:19.138
Or none of them.

00:12:19.138 --> 00:12:20.406
Some of them.

00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:23.641
How lazy can you be?

00:12:23.641 --> 00:12:25.977
If I had ten pairs of underwear,

00:12:25.977 --> 00:12:29.915
she probably wrote it in, like,
four pairs of underwear.

00:12:29.915 --> 00:12:34.286
To this day, I have no idea
if my name was written

00:12:34.286 --> 00:12:35.854
in that pair of underwear.

00:12:35.854 --> 00:12:39.358
I threw it, I walked away,
I thought, "That's gone."

00:12:39.358 --> 00:12:40.359
Is it?

00:12:40.359 --> 00:12:43.496
[laughter]

00:12:44.864 --> 00:12:47.499
As a stand-up comedian,
I've been fortunate enough

00:12:47.499 --> 00:12:51.036
to get to do some things
on television.

00:12:51.036 --> 00:12:52.103
Not a lot.

00:12:52.103 --> 00:12:53.772
I think a good amount of things.

00:12:53.772 --> 00:12:55.708
If you're trying to
do things on television,

00:12:55.708 --> 00:12:57.509
I've been fortunate enough
to get to do some.

00:12:57.509 --> 00:12:59.511
And I'm happy about it.

00:12:59.511 --> 00:13:01.513
And I've always been grateful
for that,

00:13:01.513 --> 00:13:05.216
but now knowing about this past

00:13:05.216 --> 00:13:07.853
that I deleted from my memory,

00:13:07.853 --> 00:13:09.188
I wonder,

00:13:09.188 --> 00:13:13.725
is there any chance my name
was in that underwear

00:13:13.725 --> 00:13:19.498
and anyone in that family
has ever seen me do anything?

00:13:19.498 --> 00:13:22.500
The current thing
I'm doing right now

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:25.337
is going to be on television.

00:13:25.337 --> 00:13:28.540
I just--is there a part of them
that has ever seen something

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:29.874
and been like, "Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:13:29.874 --> 00:13:31.209
"Go back, go back, go back.
No, no, no, no.

00:13:31.209 --> 00:13:32.544
"Go down, go down.
Go down.

00:13:32.544 --> 00:13:36.681
"Go down, go down.
Go down one channel.

00:13:36.681 --> 00:13:39.251
Well, then go up two channels!"

00:13:39.251 --> 00:13:41.520
[laughter]

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:42.921
"Go up two channels.

00:13:42.921 --> 00:13:44.490
"It's not even that hard.
Thank you.

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:46.392
"There.
No, stop.

00:13:46.392 --> 00:13:49.327
"Go back.
There!

00:13:49.327 --> 00:13:51.163
"Him.

00:13:51.163 --> 00:13:52.597
"That guy.

00:13:52.597 --> 00:13:55.734
"That motherfucker right there.

00:13:58.536 --> 00:14:02.374
"That's the guy
who ruined our family.

00:14:05.277 --> 00:14:06.912
"You see that, Michael?

00:14:06.912 --> 00:14:09.081
"You see him?
You remember him?

00:14:09.081 --> 00:14:10.682
"Look at him.

00:14:10.682 --> 00:14:13.752
"That guy right there.

00:14:13.752 --> 00:14:16.121
That guy's the reason
your brother killed himself."

00:14:16.121 --> 00:14:19.091
[low laughter]

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:26.431
Oh, you wanted a happy ending?

00:14:26.431 --> 00:14:30.268
I'm on television
telling the story!

00:14:30.268 --> 00:14:32.271
[laughter and applause]

00:14:32.271 --> 00:14:33.539
Thank you guys very much.

00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:35.641
I appreciate it.
