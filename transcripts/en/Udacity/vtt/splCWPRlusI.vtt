00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.750
So let's see if we can use the test

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:05.439
and write family of instructions to implement logs. The

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:08.870
instruction we will be using will be the test-and-set

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.009
instruction and its parameters are a register and a

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.148
memory address, usually in the form of offset plus

00:00:15.148 --> 00:00:19.117
a register. What test-and-set does is very similar to

00:00:19.117 --> 00:00:21.578
our test and write. In that it checks the

00:00:21.578 --> 00:00:25.152
memory location at this address. If the memory location is

00:00:25.152 --> 00:00:30.496
zero, we put a one there. And we set our one to one. If the memory location was

00:00:30.496 --> 00:00:35.972
not zero, then we just set our one to zero without writing to memory. If

00:00:35.972 --> 00:00:40.196
we have such a test-and-set instruction, the log

00:00:40.196 --> 00:00:44.228
function for a mutex lockvar can be implemented by

00:00:44.228 --> 00:00:50.870
setting our R1 to zero. And then, as long as R1 is equal to zero doing what?
