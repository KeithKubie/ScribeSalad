00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.319
I told you to stop going into space, if you
keep doing it you'll go blind!

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:09.610
Hey, pupils!

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.410
Julian here for DNews.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.960
Scientists have long been stumped as to why
some astronauts who spend an extended period

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.590
of time in space end up with vision impairment.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.360
Well, NASA could be one step closer to solving
this nebulous mystery thanks to research from

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.680
the University of Miami, which concluded that
astronauts who spent approximately six months

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.920
or more in space had a higher volume of cerebrospinal
fluid than those who had shorter trips.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.670
Now, let’s just be clear, cerebrospinal
fluid is a very good thing.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.690
It helps protect the brain and spinal cord,
delivers nutrients to nervous system tissue,

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.680
and removes waste products from the brain.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.719
However, too much of a good thing, is an awesome
thing.

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.260
But too much of an awesome thing is bad.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.040
The researchers found that cerebrospinal fluid,
which normally adjusts to pressure changes

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.850
on earth, gets discombobulated by the microgravity
in space and begins to build up near the eye

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.480
socket and in certain cavities of the brain.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.460
This added pressure of cerebrospinal fluid
could flatten out the back of the Astronaut’s

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.400
eyeballs, changing the shape of the retina,
inflaming the optic nerve, and causing choroidal

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.750
folds which are essentially wrinkles on the
inside of their eyeballs.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.210
The condition is known as visual impairment
intracranial pressure syndrome.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.230
“Visual impairment” is putting it mildly.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.560
In 2005, astronaut John Phillips spent six
months at the International Space Station,

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.390
during which time his vision went from 20/20
to 20/100.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.560
That means he had to stand 20 feet away from
a line of letters to see them clearly, while

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.150
the average person can make them out at 100
feet.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.030
A similar impairment happened to astronaut
Robert Thirsk in 2009 after also spending

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.630
six months at the station.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.220
Though both astronauts saw gradual improvements
after returning home, their vision was never

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.130
fully restored to its original state.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.950
Astronaut Scott Kelly also fell victim to
the space-induced vision loss, and today is

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.119
forced to rely on reading glasses since returning
from his year in space in 2015.

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.930
It’s difficult to test if fluid-buildup
is the culprit because the only way to measure

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.590
the increased pressure accurately would be
to drill a hole in the astronaut’s skull

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.869
or do a spinal tap in space.

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.330
Talk about turning it up to 11.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.399
It also doesn’t explain why only around
20% of Astronauts who went on long missions

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:05.610
come down seeing worse than when they went
up.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.979
So other causes have been proposed, like a
vitamin or folate deficiency.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.069
Most strangly is the idea that the vision
loss is caused by polycystic ovarian syndrome

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.769
(or PCOS) which, as you might expect, causes
cysts on ovaries.

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:22.169
Seems a little odd, considering all the astronauts
who have suffered vision loss were men and

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:24.120
I’m going to wager they don’t have ovaries.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.939
And even if they did, their ovaries aren’t
in their eyeballs.

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:28.299
Again, I’m assuming.

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:32.790
But the name is misleading, even for women:
20% of women who have it don’t have polycystic

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:33.790
ovaries.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.939
They do have a hormone imbalance though, which
is the underlying cause of the cysts.

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:43.099
And male relatives of women with PCOS sometimes
have similar symptoms, so it may also affect

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:44.099
men.

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.769
Researchers at the Johnson Space Center noticed
that like the women with PCOS, the visually

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:52.889
stunted spacefarers had higher levels of one-carbon
metabolites like the amino acid homocysteine

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:53.889
in their blood.

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:57.559
When they looked closer, they found the astronauts
have even more in common with women with PCOS,

00:02:57.559 --> 00:03:01.589
like the same genetic traits and thicker retinal
nerve fiber layers.

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:05.969
As a result some NASA scientists believe further
research on PCOS could help explain why some

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:08.580
male astronauts return with vision damage.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.209
Whether scientists are researching fluids
of the brain or the non-existent ovaries of

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.129
men, this has become an issue NASA takes seriously.

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:16.209
And for good reason.

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.239
With America’s plans to send humans to Mars
by the 2030s, scientists have a lot to figure

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.639
out to ensure astronauts don’t go blind
on their way to the Red Planet.

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:26.779
You eyeballs might not survive space even
in a space suit.

00:03:26.779 --> 00:03:29.969
But would they bug out Total Recall style
if the suit broke?

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:33.729
Trace talks about how your unprotected body
would handle a spacewalk here.

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:36.790
So you have a ticket to Mars but there’s
a 20% chance you’ll go blind.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:37.989
Do you take it?

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.999
