David: Hi, I'm David,
and what I would like to see to make the world

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:04.610
a better place is that every
individual be practically kind and moral,

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:10.700
Becomes responsible for their own carbon footprint.
That could have lots of benefits because if

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:25.590
you are carbon light in your
footprint, than you have something positive

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.590
to trade.
If you are carbon heavy, than you owe a debt

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.010
to society.
That way we can get a much better climate,

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.440
and have some possibility of making real serious
change throughout the world.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.279
Thatâ€™s it.
