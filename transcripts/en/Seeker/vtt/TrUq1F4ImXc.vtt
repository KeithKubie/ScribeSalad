00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.479
Our nearest neighbor Andromeda lies 2.5 million
years away, yet we can still see it with the

00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:06.549
naked eye here on Earth.

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:12.200
Have you ever wondered what’s going on in
the galaxy next door?

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.430
Hey everyone Julia here for DNews

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.070
Andromeda gets its name from a beautiful princess
in Greek mythology, whose name means ruler

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.070
of men.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.500
Humankind has seen this fuzzy patch in the
sky for centuries but no one was sure what

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.500
it was.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.750
Until 1923 when Edwin Hubble figured out that
it wasn’t just a cloud of dust in our galaxy

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.970
but a cluster of stars much, much further
away.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.910
At least ten times as far as the stars at
the edges of our own galaxy.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.530
This discovery rocked the world and changed
our view of the universe forever.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.630
We no longer thought that Milky Way was the
entire universe.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.040
Now we knew there could be hundreds, thousands,
maybe millions more galaxies, just like our

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.040
own.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.370
Since then we’ve learned a lot about our
neighbor.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.920
Scientists recently made a really cool discovery
using the Hubble Space Telescope.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.649
They discovered that Andromeda is surrounded
by a giant ball of gas!

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:01.810
And I mean GIANT.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.100
It nearly reaches halfway to the Milky Way!

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.460
That’s more than a million light years.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.460
WHOA.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.170
It’s so big that if you could see it with
the naked eye its diameter would be 100 times

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.330
the size of the moon.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.380
But the gas is dark, so sadly, we can’t
see it.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.850
Andromeda is a spiral galaxy.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.630
It’s also known as Messier 31, M31, or NGC
224, and is bigger than the Milky Way.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.330
It might be as wide as 220,000 light-years
in diameter according to a paper published

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.000
in The Astrophysical Journal, while our own
galaxy is about half that size.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.100
It also contains a trillion stars while our
small system only has a quarter to half a

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.100
billion.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.690
Nearly 70% of those stars lie mostly in a
thin disc which surrounds a bulge of older

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.140
stars near the galaxy’s core.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.990
But a team of international researchers from
UCLA and Cambridge University also found a

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.210
thick rotating disc of older stars and their
path extends above and below the thinner disc.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.870
Some researchers think these discs provide
clues to how the galaxy formed.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.200
Claire Dorman a grad study at UC Santa Cruz,
found stars in Andromeda’s discs that moved

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.320
in two ways, ordered and disordered.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.130
The disordered movement of some of the stars
might suggest that Andromeda had a violent

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.049
past, colliding with and cannibalizing some
smaller galaxies.

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:13.790
And Andromeda has a lot of smaller satellite
galaxies swirling around its edges.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.959
So far scientists have counted more than 20.

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.680
One of those galaxies, Andromeda II has some
strange patterns of start movements that suggests

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.129
that we’re actually witnessing the end of
a small galactic collision.

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:25.129
and oh yeah guys.

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:26.129
Speaking of collisions.

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:27.290
we’re gonna bang I mean.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.290
Our galaxies.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.449
The milky way and andromeda are set on a collision
course.

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:34.790
Andromeda is speeding towards us at 250,000
miles per hour!

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.269
When they collide it won’t be an explosion
of smashing stars.

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.620
The stars in each galaxy are too far apart
to be a real threat to each other.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.829
But they might get jostled up a bit.

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.719
One simulation suggests that our own solar
system might wind up further away from the

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:48.719
core of the Milky Way.

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:52.640
But rest easy, it won’t happen for another
four billion years.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.951
While we're on the subject of space, have
you wondered why everything in the universe

00:02:55.951 --> 00:02:56.951
is spinning?

00:02:56.951 --> 00:02:59.239
Trace explains in this video here.

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:04.730
Alright y’all, space is a big place!

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:15.230
And there’s still a lot to learn about it,
what do you guys wanna know about the final

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.230
frontier?

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.019
Let us know down in the comments below.

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:23.349
