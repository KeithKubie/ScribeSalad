[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.050
ALAN MOSS: Welcome
to Talks at Google.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:09.930
I'm Alan Moss.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.310
I'm Vice President of
Sales and Operations here,

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.760
and it is my distinct
pleasure to welcome Leslie

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.900
Berlin to Talks at Google.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.100
LESLIE BERLIN: Thank you.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.460
ALAN MOSS: Leslie is the author
of the recently published book

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.570
"Troublemakers--

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.550
Silicon Valley's Coming of Age."

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.980
Her first book was "The
Man Behind the Microchip--

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.770
Robert Noyce and the
Invention of Silicon Valley."

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.040
She is Project Historian for
the Silicon Valley Archives

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.900
at Stanford University.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.720
And she's been a columnist
for the New York Times

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.030
and commented on technology
in Silicon Valley

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.341
for the Wall Street Journal,
NPR, BBC, the Atlantic, PBS,

00:00:44.341 --> 00:00:44.840
Wired--

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.339
you get it.

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:49.620
So really thrilled to
have Leslie today and host

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.260
a conversation on her new book.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.580
So what we'll do is I'll have
an opportunity to talk a bit

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.040
and have this
conversation with Leslie,

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.950
and then we'll open it
up to your questions.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.319
Googlers are
usually not bashful.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:08.070
And we have a mic here,
and special inducement--

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.840
particularly good
questions will also

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.330
come with a book,
a copy of your own.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.692
With that, welcome, Leslie.

00:01:13.692 --> 00:01:14.650
Great to have you here.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.920
LESLIE BERLIN: Thank you.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.810
ALAN MOSS: So where to start?

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.160
In "Troublemakers,"
you chronicle

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.740
seven individuals who were
in the technology space

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.520
the very early days,
so 1969 to about 1984,

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.640
and their contributions to not
only founding new industries

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.960
in video gaming, personal
computing, biotechnology,

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.730
and many more.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.710
How did you choose to
focus on these individuals?

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.980
LESLIE BERLIN: Well, the
first thing I did was I

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.130
put together a timeline
of Silicon Valley

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.030
history, just with a dot for
each kind of significant event.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:01.870
And in this period between 1969
and 1976, the density of dots

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.780
was unmatched
anywhere, because you

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.490
had the founding of Apple,
Genentech, Atari, Kleiner

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.130
Perkins, Sequoia Capital.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.390
You had the first
ARPANET transmission

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.370
that turns into the internet.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.580
You had the birth of the
independent software business.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.920
You had the invention of the
microchip, the microprocessor.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.770
And it was like watching
the big bang, basically.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.370
Just [EXPLOSION SOUND].

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.530
Because before this
time, Silicon Valley

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.570
was like this
regional backwater,

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.850
wasn't even called
Silicon Valley.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.640
It sort of existed around
one industry, which

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.100
was microchips, semiconductors.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.830
And it was gearheads
selling to gearheads.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.320
And at the end of--
really if you just

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.960
look at the first
seven years, you

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.710
have personal computing
and video games.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.260
So you have the first really
high-tech consumer electronics

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.100
making it out into the world,
microprocessor-based consumer

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.240
electronics.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.576
You have the biotech
industry being born

00:03:03.576 --> 00:03:04.700
and modern venture capital.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.840
It was crazy to see
what had happened.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.340
And then I was
trying to figure out,

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.810
how on Earth do you tell a
story that is this complicated?

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.340
And I decided that
the answer had

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.230
to be that you had
to find good people

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.730
to tell this story through.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.040
Because I don't
know how many of you

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.160
have ever sat through
reading about the invention

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.410
of a particular
piece of technology.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.530
And that can be kind
of dry, whereas I

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.430
think that the stories of how
people did it, and sometimes

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.490
how they failed to do
it, are very interesting.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.550
So my criteria were three.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.990
I wanted to find people
who were largely unknown--

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.040
that was really important to me.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.460
So this is why when
I write about Apple,

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.520
for example, I don't
write about Jobs,

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.290
and I don't write about Wozniak.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.040
I mean, they're both peripheral
characters next to the person

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.040
who's my main focus,
who is Mike Markkula.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.310
And most people don't
know about Mike,

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.320
but Mike owned a third of
Apple along with Jobs and Woz

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.390
when they started the company.

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:16.300
And he was the guy who came to
the famous garage in Cupertino

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.519
and saw these two guys who--

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.120
I mean, Jobs was 21.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.560
Woz was a few years older.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.290
Jobs would have loved to figure
out how to start a company,

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.400
but he had 17 months of business
experience in his entire life,

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.980
and that was as
a tech for Atari.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.710
Woz would have been happy
to stay at HP forever

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.486
and ever as an engineer.

00:04:38.486 --> 00:04:40.610
As a matter of fact, he
tried to sell the Apple I--

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.830
he tried to give the Apple I
to HP, and they didn't want it.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.770
So I knew that there
were tons and tons

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.980
of these little companies,
these little personal computer

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.630
wannabe companies in what we now
call Silicon Valley, in places

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.256
like Albuquerque.

00:05:00.256 --> 00:05:02.380
So what was it that was
special about this company?

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.610
Because they all had a
Jobs-ian type, not as

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.920
brilliant as Steve Jobs.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.800
They all had a Wozniak-ian
type, not as brilliant as Woz,

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.500
perhaps.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.830
But none of them
had a Mike Markkula.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.690
And Mike had retired from Intel.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.120
He'd gotten there
before the IPO.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.580
He had watched this
little bitty company that

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:27.830
was in another company's castoff
space grow into what it became.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.710
And he knew how to
turn this idea he saw,

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.070
which was the Apple II,
into what Apple became,

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.170
which was the youngest
company ever to make it

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.850
into the Fortune 500.

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.330
So I wanted to tell the
stories of those people whose

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.790
roles were so important
but nobody knew them.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.080
And what inspired it,
actually, was I was at a party,

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.280
and at this party was
the COO of a company that

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.800
has a superstar CEO.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.380
And this COO started
singing a little song,

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.290
and the song's only words
were, "I did all the work,

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:03.290
he got all the credit."

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:04.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.620
And I thought, you know, for
all the people in the spotlight,

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.510
even the people who deserve
to be in the spotlight,

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:15.370
there are so many people who
are just outside the spotlight,

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.230
without whom that person in the
spotlight would never be there.

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.790
And so I wanted to tell
those people's stories.

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:21.790
ALAN MOSS: That's great.

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:23.290
LESLIE BERLIN: Yeah, so that
was criteria one, right?

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:24.670
They had to be unknown.

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:28.020
Criteria two, they
had to be important.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:32.090
There are plenty of unknowns
who don't do anything important.

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.210
And then the third
criteria was they

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.090
had to be really, really
interesting people,

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.110
for just what I was
talking about earlier.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.180
This is a book for
a general audience.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.930
It's a bunch of
stories in addition

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:47.670
to having these sort
of broader themes,

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:52.260
and it's underpinned by 100
pages of notes at the back.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:56.400
It's a very deeply researched
I-have-a-PhD-in-history kind

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.210
of book.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.850
But it's all buried
super-duper deep so

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:01.166
that the stories can come up.

00:07:01.166 --> 00:07:02.790
And if that's what
you're trying to do,

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:04.560
you have to have really
interesting people

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.669
to talk about.

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:06.960
So that's how I chose the time.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.346
That how I chose the people.

00:07:08.346 --> 00:07:09.140
ALAN MOSS: Great.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:09.639
Thank you.

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:11.220
I won't ask you who that COO is.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.720
I'm guessing that
won't be revealed.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.360
LESLIE BERLIN: And
I would not tell.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.210
ALAN MOSS: So since you
introduced Mike Markkula

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:21.640
so well, let's maybe briefly
introduce the other characters.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.640
Maybe I can read them
out, and you could sort of

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:27.180
give us a couple-liner
on why Bob

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:32.535
Taylor at first the Pentagon
and then Xerox PARC.

00:07:32.535 --> 00:07:34.470
LESLIE BERLIN: Yeah, so
Bob Taylor is probably

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:36.178
the person in the book
who has the widest

00:07:36.178 --> 00:07:38.580
gap between how
important what he did was

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.650
and how unknown he is.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:42.690
Bob Taylor is the
guy who convinced

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:45.300
the Department of Defense
to start what today we

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.090
call the internet,
to start the ARPANET.

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:51.840
Then he, after that,
went to Xerox PARC,

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:57.550
where he ran that lab that came
up with all of the components--

00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:59.910
with their sister lab;
the System Science

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:02.100
Lab was the sister lab--

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.600
that came up with
all the components

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.522
of the modern personal computer,
kind of put them together.

00:08:06.522 --> 00:08:07.980
That's the place
that had first had

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.020
the overlapping
windows, and WYSIWYG,

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:13.140
and the mouse first in place.

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:18.100
By 1977 this lab had the ability
to have someone in Miami--

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:21.450
I saw a demo of this, it
knocked my socks off--

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:24.660
controlling the cursor on the
screen of someone in Palo Alto,

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.120
in 1977.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.420
So Taylor ran that lab.

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:32.130
That's the lab that Steve
Jobs famously visited in 1979

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:34.230
and saw all this in
action and said, hm,

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:35.309
I want that for Apple.

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:40.100
And it moved into the Lisa
and then later into the Mac.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.919
And Taylor ran this lab with--

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:46.050
he had a master's
degree in psychology

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:49.770
and was running this lab that
was so full of brilliant PhD

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:53.520
computer scientists that
the president of MIT

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.190
worried aloud that the
future of computer science

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.620
education in the United
States was questionable,

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.980
because everyone great was
working for Bob Taylor.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:05.100
That includes Eric Schmidt
of Google worked for Taylor.

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.640
The co-founders of Adobe,
Geschke and Warnock,

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.750
worked for Taylor.

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:13.710
Charles Simonyi, who
went on to do the Office

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:16.980
Suite at Microsoft,
worked for Taylor.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.845
Larry Tesler, who is key at Ap--

00:09:18.845 --> 00:09:20.220
I mean, it can
just go on and on.

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:24.630
Alan Kay was brought to
Xerox PARC by Bob Taylor.

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:28.950
So this incredibly important
guy, no one knows what he did.

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:34.290
Oh, and then he went on DEC,
where they had Altavista.

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:37.650
One of his researchers was
the key guy behind Altavista,

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:41.320
many years before Google was
a glimmer in anyone's eye.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:41.820
So--

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:42.500
ALAN MOSS: Enough said.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.234
LESLIE BERLIN: --super
important, yeah.

00:09:44.234 --> 00:09:45.900
ALAN MOSS: How about
Al Alcorn of Atari?

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.100
LESLIE BERLIN: Al Alcorn.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.310
Al Alcorn was the
designer of Pong,

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:54.270
the first huge video
game for Atari,

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:56.260
and a really interesting guy.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.830
Because he is an
engineer's engineer.

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:02.100
And I really wanted
to be sure to capture

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.500
the stories of people
who were heads down,

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.540
doing the engineering.

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.190
But again, fascinating guy--

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:11.510
had a picture of Lyndon Johnson
on his wall in the late '60s

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:12.885
and used him for
target practice.

00:10:12.885 --> 00:10:13.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.700
Very interesting guy.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.230
ALAN MOSS: That's great.

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:18.180
Fawn Alvarez and ROLM.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:21.450
LESLIE BERLIN: Fawn Alvarez is
someone when the book opens,

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:25.560
she's 12 years old, and
she is picking fruit

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:29.180
in the orchards that used to
be all over Silicon Valley.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:31.920
It was called the Valley
of the Heart's Delight.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.670
And she is doing this in the
bucolic haven of Cupertino,

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:37.080
California.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.630
And she goes on--

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:41.760
she doesn't go to college,
but she gets a job

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.220
on the manufacturing
line at ROLM.

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.970
Something that most people
don't know about Silicon Valley

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:50.880
is that this used to be
a manufacturing economy.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.620
There were factories here.

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.590
They were called fabs,
but they were here.

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:59.100
And they anchored the economy.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:02.730
And there were plenty of
very, very good middle class

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:08.550
jobs for people who
didn't have an education

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:10.140
beyond a high school degree.

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:13.500
And I wanted her story
to be there because A,

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.870
she illuminates that
sort of transition

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:17.700
from the orchards
to manufacturing,

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:21.000
and then she keeps going
and ends up as, essentially,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.650
the chief of staff
to the president

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:26.880
of IBM ROLM as ROLM
itself is moving

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.890
all of its manufacturing
out of the area.

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:32.880
And she moves much more
into the Silicon Valley jobs

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:33.840
that we think of today.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.880
ALAN MOSS: Yeah, great.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.670
These next two are
sort of a paired set,

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:43.800
with Niels Reimers of Stanford's
Office of Technology Licensing

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.195
and Bob Swanson of Genentech.

00:11:45.195 --> 00:11:46.070
LESLIE BERLIN: Right.

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:49.520
So this is the story of
the biotech industry.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.280
I mean, it took me six
years to write this book,

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.500
and part of the reason it
did was that it's basically

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.350
six books in one book.

00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:01.430
So Niels Reimers is the guy
who started Stanford's Office

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:03.170
of Technology Licensing.

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:07.460
When he got to
Stanford in 1970, he

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:15.350
saw that Stanford's entire
income from the inventions

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:17.450
of all of its faculty,
staff, and students

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:22.220
for the previous 13 years
had been $3,000 combined,

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:24.590
about $260 a year.

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:26.240
He decided that
didn't make any sense.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:29.090
He decided to try
to start something,

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:31.320
and he was not a
high-powered, high-level guy.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:36.140
He was sort of a mid-level
staffer, and not an attorney,

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:36.640
either.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:40.890
And he started the office that,
to date, has brought $2 billion

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:42.800
into Stanford.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.810
And that office is the
reason that Stanford

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:47.420
had a stake in Google's
search algorithm

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:50.720
and had a nice chunk
of equity in Google.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:55.220
Similar for VMware-- that's
another big one out of Stanford

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.380
Office of Technology Licensing.

00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:04.070
And this talks about their
first really big hit, which was

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:06.590
the patent for recombinant DNA.

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:11.780
The whole notion of patenting
this process was a radical one.

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:14.310
He faced a lot of challenges.

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:19.850
And one of the people he worked
closely with from early on

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:24.050
was Bob Swanson, who was
the co-founder of Genentech

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:28.480
and someone who he'd been
an associate partner.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:32.480
He was like a rocket ship,
superstar guy, takes a chance,

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.490
and becomes an
associate partner, one

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:36.500
of the first ones--
maybe the first one?

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:40.490
I'm not sure-- at Kleiner
Perkins Caulfield and Byers.

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:46.360
Gets fired, and I mean, was
really rocked back on his heels

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.610
and decides that
he really believes

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:51.170
in this thing he's read about,
which is recombinant DNA.

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:53.500
He's read about it in
"Science" magazine.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.780
Can't find anyone to help
him start this company,

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:59.230
ends up going on welfare while
he tries to figure it out--

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:02.410
it's very much sort of a
JK Rowling type story--

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:05.345
and ends up launching Genentech.

00:14:05.345 --> 00:14:06.345
ALAN MOSS: Unbelievable.

00:14:06.345 --> 00:14:07.060
Great story.

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:08.726
LESLIE BERLIN: Yeah,
it's a great story.

00:14:08.726 --> 00:14:11.350
ALAN MOSS: And last but not
least, Sandy Kurtzig, Founder

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:13.150
and CEO of ASK Computer.

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:16.000
LESLIE BERLIN: Right, so Sandy
Kurtzig is the first woman

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.340
to take a tech company public.

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:23.030
She started a software
company called ASK in 1972.

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:27.160
And I wanted to write about
Sandy primarily because I

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.260
wanted to write about software.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.500
This is the first time,
not just her company,

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:37.630
but this is the time when,
in the wake of an IBM consent

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:41.144
decree, software and hardware
are unbundled from each other.

00:14:41.144 --> 00:14:43.810
And so you get these independent
little bitty software companies

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:45.340
coming up.

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.847
This was Silicon Valley at
a time when, I just said,

00:14:47.847 --> 00:14:48.930
they were building things.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:50.380
It was a hardware place.

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:53.440
And even Larry Ellison,
who started Oracle

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.870
at around this exact
same time, talked

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:59.470
about how he couldn't get
anyone to pay attention

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:01.900
to his entreaties
to give him money

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:03.430
to start a software company.

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:05.680
He said that the
venture capitalists just

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.870
laughed him out of the office.

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:10.390
And so Sandy was
interesting to me

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:13.540
because she's an outsider
because she's doing software,

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:15.940
and she's an outsider
because she's a woman.

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:19.780
So people literally think when
she says she's selling software

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:21.820
that she's selling lingerie.

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:24.580
And so her story--

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:29.460
she's someone who comes up kind
of outside these famed networks

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:32.410
that other people
like Mike Markkula

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:34.360
was able to bring Apple into.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.780
If you look at Apple's
S1 at their IPO,

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:41.440
almost every single
senior exec plus,

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:45.730
their funders all had
ties through Markkula

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:47.560
to the semiconductor industry.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.670
Not the case for Sandy Kurtzig.

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:52.480
She bootstrapped it
from her kitchen table.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:59.360
And HP gave them time on their
computers late, late at night.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.050
That was sort of as
close as she came

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:04.540
to tapping into this
network and again, was

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:05.860
a story I wanted to pull out.

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:08.050
Because HP now has
really diminished

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:10.750
in people's understanding
of its importance,

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:14.140
but they brought up so many--
dozens of these little software

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.120
companies couldn't
afford computers.

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.080
They were hundreds of
thousands of dollars.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.360
How could you possibly
afford one of those?

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.750
But you could go in
after hours at HP.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:24.520
Literally you could
bring a sleeping bag

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:26.800
and sleep on a
floor in the closet

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.710
and use their computers
to try to debug your code.

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:32.430
So it was an
exciting story, too.

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:34.300
ALAN MOSS: Yeah, that's great.

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:38.695
And arguably one of the earliest
independent software vendors,

00:16:38.695 --> 00:16:40.660
as they used to be
known, or ISVs out there.

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:42.520
LESLIE BERLIN: Yeah, exactly.

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.140
In the applications
business-- it's

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:45.430
funny we've gone back to that.

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:47.560
That's how they talked
about themselves then.

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:48.370
ALAN MOSS: Indeed.

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:52.360
So with your
background in history,

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:54.190
you note there's
five major industries

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:59.630
in seven years between 1969
and 1976 that are born.

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:03.310
They are the personal
computing, video games, biotech,

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:06.859
modern venture capital,
and advanced semiconductor

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:08.440
industries.

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:11.680
As you look back in
other times in history,

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.990
has there ever been
another time like this,

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:15.970
in terms of the kind
of inventiveness?

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:17.170
How does it compare?

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:18.970
LESLIE BERLIN: You
know, I didn't come up

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:22.839
with anything that was
really comparable in terms

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:25.210
of the breadth and impact.

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:26.589
I mean, that is just--

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:30.220
when you look at
where we are today,

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:34.210
you can trace so much of it
back to this tiny little place

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:37.150
in this little period of time.

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:41.704
And I think that, to me, it was
unrivaled and actually points

00:17:41.704 --> 00:17:43.120
to one of the
things that I always

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:45.670
think is so interesting
about Silicon Valley, which

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:49.780
is that this has been
the birthplace of so

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:50.750
many different things.

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:53.320
In this case, I'm talking
about one generation.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.109
But people always
want to understand.

00:17:55.109 --> 00:17:56.650
People come to
Stanford all the time.

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:59.110
Why did Silicon Valley
get started here?

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:02.020
But to me a much more
interesting question is, why

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:04.360
is Silicon Valley still going?

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:07.960
I mean, Hewlett-Packard
started in 1939.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.280
Why is it still going?

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:14.080
And why have there been so
many different generations

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.270
of technology that have
come out of this place?

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:19.870
Because, I mean, you start with
HP and with instrumentation,

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:21.760
and then you're into
the chips, and then

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:24.700
you're into the sort of
stuff I'm talking about,

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:26.560
consumer electronics
and biotech.

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:29.140
And then you're into
networking, and then--

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.280
I mean, you can just kind
of keep going forward.

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:34.930
And then we're in cloud,
and mobile, and search.

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:36.730
Cars are here.

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:39.700
And so how did all that happen?

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:46.000
And I think that I always
point to two things, actually.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.840
One is the role of
people doing what

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.910
Mike Markkula did in this book.

00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:56.530
When Jobs spoke at
Stanford in 2005,

00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:59.110
he talked about when
he was fired from Apple

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:03.550
and how the first thing he
did was pick up the phone

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:06.700
and call Bob Noyce, who is
the subject of my first book

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:10.750
and a co-founder of
Intel, and David Packard.

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:15.460
And Jobs said, I apologized
for dropping the baton.

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:18.490
And he had this sense of
sort of this relay race

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:21.340
across time, generation
to generation,

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:23.140
handing off the baton.

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:26.050
And I think that's been such
an important part of Silicon

00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:27.310
Valley history.

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:31.810
And I think that,
in some sense, part

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:33.430
of what I hope
this book can serve

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:35.770
as is a baton pass, sort
of like, well, here's

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:37.900
how this generation did it.

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:39.910
And then the second thing
that I always point to

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:42.310
is how important
immigrants have been

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:46.170
to the rise of Silicon Valley.

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:51.630
Basically in the time that I'm
writing about, we're still--

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:55.246
people are coming here from
other parts of the world,

00:19:55.246 --> 00:19:57.120
I mean, from other parts
of the United States

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.590
at an insane rate.

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:02.670
It was as if a new
person moved into Silicon

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:06.930
Valley every half hour
for 20 years straight,

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:08.160
and no one moved out.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:08.250
ALAN MOSS: Wow.

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:10.500
LESLIE BERLIN: I mean, that's
the pace at which people

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.210
were coming into
the Valley, mostly

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:13.740
from other parts of the country.

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.810
Now they come from
all over the world,

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:17.790
but the effect has been
exactly the same, which

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:22.650
is this constant refresh
into the system of new ideas,

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:25.560
the best and brightest, and very
often the biggest risk takers.

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:30.540
Because what it takes to pick
up and leave your country, often

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:33.930
your language, your
family, your home

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:37.830
to try to do something really
different is so important.

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:40.620
And at this point we've
got 2/3 of the people

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:43.380
working in science and
tech in Silicon Valley

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:45.690
are born outside of
the United States.

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:51.150
So that's been another sort of
secret to the Valley's success.

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:56.460
And I think that while I
can't see a comparable time

00:20:56.460 --> 00:21:01.240
period for this book, I
feel like, in some ways,

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.600
it was almost like
the firing gun

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.571
for everything that
has come since.

00:21:06.571 --> 00:21:07.820
ALAN MOSS: The starting block.

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:09.150
Yeah, that's great.

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:14.070
Maybe that's a good place to
ask you to read an excerpt

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:15.630
and set the scene.

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:17.700
A bunch of us live in
Silicon Valley here,

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:21.690
and you mentioned the
orchards and manufacturing.

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:24.330
I'd love to ask you to read
a passage from the book that

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:26.430
maybe gives us a
sense of what it was

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:29.150
like at the end of
the '60s, early '70s

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:32.260
and what that sort
of formative period

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:33.595
was like, if you don't mind.

00:21:33.595 --> 00:21:34.470
LESLIE BERLIN: Great.

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:36.678
We talked about this in
advance, so I have it marked.

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:42.960
So the way the book is
organized, I should explain,

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:46.250
is it has what I think
of as core samples.

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:48.660
It's different time periods.

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:50.820
So I've got all
these seven people.

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:53.580
One way you could have done this
book is talk about person A--

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:55.230
here's what they
were doing 1969.

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:57.188
We're going to follow
them all the way through.

00:21:57.188 --> 00:21:59.670
Now we're going to move our
person B all the way through.

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:04.916
That, to me, was going to lose
the magic of the story, which

00:22:04.916 --> 00:22:06.540
is that these people's
lives, they just

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:08.190
keep kind of overlapping.

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:12.390
I mean, Don Valentine shows
up again and again and again.

00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:13.710
And they had Larry Sonsini--

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:15.293
he's here and he's
here and he's here.

00:22:15.293 --> 00:22:17.100
Regis McKenna-- just
the same people.

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:19.710
And so I wanted to make sure--

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:24.060
in order, venture
capitalist, attorney, PR guy.

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:27.420
The best in the
business, all of them.

00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:31.420
I wanted to find a way
to overlap those stories.

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:35.460
So I tell where everyone
is in each time period.

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:38.940
And I start those time periods
with a sort of, you are here.

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:41.820
This is what Silicon Valley
was like at this time.

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:47.740
So this is for the sort of
1972 to '75 time period.

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:49.380
I'll just read you it.

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:51.810
"In 1971, a hard
drinking reporter

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:54.480
named Don Hoefler published
a three-part history

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.510
of the men, money,
and litigation

00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:59.490
behind the
semiconductor business.

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:01.830
He titled the series, which
appeared in an industry

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:06.600
newsletter called Electronic
News, 'Silicon Valley, USA.'

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.330
It was the first formal
use of a name that had,

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:12.840
for years, been bandied
about inside the Valley.

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.180
"No one beyond the
readers of Electronic News

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:16.950
took notice of
the new technology

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:20.490
region that had been born on
the San Francisco Peninsula.

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:23.470
Individual companies had begun
to attract outside interest.

00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:27.684
So Intel had its IPO in
that same year, 1971.

00:23:27.684 --> 00:23:29.100
But it would be
three years before

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.920
any major national publication
wrote about the Peninsula

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:35.580
as a distinct
technology-based region.

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:37.560
Years would pass
before the name Silicon

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:38.957
Valley gained widespread use."

00:23:38.957 --> 00:23:41.040
And it's actually really
funny all the other names

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.930
that people came up
with-- it was Silicon

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:45.270
Gulch, Semiconductor Country.

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:48.090
Semiconductor Country
is pretty good.

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:51.570
"In the early 1970s, Silicon
Valley startup companies

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:54.420
were largely deemed irrelevant
to the real business

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:57.690
of the United States, which
was concentrated in East Coast

00:23:57.690 --> 00:24:01.020
financial centers in cities
such as Detroit, and Pittsburgh,

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:04.500
and Chicago that had
manufacturing at their core."

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:06.750
The nation's new mini
computer companies--

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:09.360
these were kind of the hot
thing that everyone knew about--

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:12.180
were all clustered
around MIT and Harvard

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:15.570
along Boston's Route 128.

00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:17.070
OK, so here's what was going on.

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:19.317
Stanford's reputation
was on the rise,

00:24:19.317 --> 00:24:21.150
which we know because
it was beginning to be

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:24.210
called the Harvard of the West.

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:26.820
"But still, the university
attracted mostly students

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:28.560
from California.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:31.680
San Francisco was best
known for its hippies.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:35.280
Palo Alto was fighting
its reputation as quote

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:38.820
'the Peninsula's largest
sex shop center,' thanks

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:41.220
to an eight-block stretch
of El Camino Real near

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:44.430
the city's southern border
that was home to multiple adult

00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:47.120
bookstores, an
X-rated movie theater,

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:51.230
and massage parlors with names
such as The Streaker and The

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:52.530
Foxy Lady."

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:55.490
This is down the street from
my first house, actually.

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:57.950
"None of this pointed
to a promising future

00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:00.601
as an economic powerhouse.

00:25:00.601 --> 00:25:02.850
The rest of the business
world might not have noticed,

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:07.040
but inside Silicon Valley,
things were brewing in 1972.

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:10.220
The previous year, Intel had
invented the microprocessor,

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:12.710
the chip that would soon
nestle at the heart of consumer

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:15.930
electronics such as the personal
computer and video games.

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:18.560
"Meanwhile, Hewlett-Packard
became the first Silicon Valley

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:21.350
company to discover that an
advanced electronic device

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:23.840
could have broad
consumer appeal.

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:28.370
In 1972, the company introduced
the HP-35, the world's

00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:31.410
first handheld calculator
that could do more than add,

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:33.980
subtract, multiply, and divide.

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:38.870
HP sold more than 100,000 in
the first year, despite a $400

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:39.410
price tag."

00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:42.887
Which is a very
significant price tag.

00:25:42.887 --> 00:25:43.970
This was my favorite part.

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:47.300
"A cheeky chapter called
Shirt Pocket Power

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:51.440
in the owner's manual noted,
'We thought you'd like to have

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:55.220
something only fictional heroes
like James Bond, Walter Mitty,

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:58.130
or Dick Tracy are supposed
to own.'" For a pocket

00:25:58.130 --> 00:25:58.880
calculator--

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.207
I just love that.

00:26:00.207 --> 00:26:01.790
"For the most part,
these developments

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:05.160
within Silicon Valley happened
independently of one another.

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:08.630
But like different streams
that feed a swift-moving river,

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:11.510
the work would soon begin
to blend and swirl together.

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:13.790
The resulting network of
personal and institutional

00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:15.560
connections would
form the foundation

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:18.440
of today's Silicon Valley
and the high technology

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:19.077
revolution."

00:26:19.077 --> 00:26:19.910
ALAN MOSS: Fabulous.

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:22.430
LESLIE BERLIN: So that's
sort of where we were.

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:23.815
And look where we are now.

00:26:23.815 --> 00:26:25.440
ALAN MOSS: Just a
little bit different,

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.065
for those of you that
live in the area,

00:26:27.065 --> 00:26:30.550
a little different picture
of the local environment

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:31.980
back in the early '70s.

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:33.730
LESLIE BERLIN: Yeah,
and especially people

00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:36.020
looking at the Valley
from the East Coast--

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:38.120
I mean, it's amazing.

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:43.640
In the book you mainly see this
because Xerox is headquartered

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:44.620
on the East Coast.

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:50.330
And so they're looking at these
crazies in Palo Alto who--

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:54.620
I mean, this is a company who
almost all of their profits

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:58.760
came from the paper that they
sold with the Xerox machines.

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:02.000
And here they've got
this research lab that's

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.240
gone completely rogue and
is trying to figure out,

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:08.360
how do we start doing all
of the important stuff

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.730
before it ever even
hits the paper?

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:15.650
And their descriptions of
Xerox PARC and this area

00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:16.800
are hilarious.

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:20.670
I mean, they're just sort of
like, everyone eats tofu there.

00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:22.040
People jog.

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:29.454
I mean, it's just amazing to
see how suspicious people were.

00:27:29.454 --> 00:27:30.870
They were watching
the television.

00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:33.150
They were seeing
what was going on

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:38.360
in San Francisco and these
protests in Berkeley,

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:41.100
because the Vietnam War
is just at its height.

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:43.590
Had a huge implication
for what happened here,

00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:46.740
because so many people
who would have gone--

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:48.717
if you were a graphics
expert at this time,

00:27:48.717 --> 00:27:49.800
what were you going to do?

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.133
You were going to go work for
the Department of Defense,

00:27:52.133 --> 00:27:54.361
almost certainly, or
maybe a subcontractor.

00:27:54.361 --> 00:27:56.610
But all of the sudden you
have these people coming out

00:27:56.610 --> 00:27:59.640
of school, and they don't want
anything to do with the DoD.

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:03.400
They don't want anything to do
with the war that's happening.

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.460
And that is to
the gain of places

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:12.180
like Xerox PARC, and Atari,
and eventually Apple.

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:15.280
Silicon Valley's history,
really too often for my money,

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:18.150
is told in total
isolation from what's

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:19.980
going on in the
rest of the country,

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:21.580
much less the rest of the world.

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:24.426
And so this is a great
example of why it mattered.

00:28:24.426 --> 00:28:25.800
Who would have
thought that would

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.540
have been a consequence of the
Vietnam War, but it really was.

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:32.230
ALAN MOSS: Yeah, and all the
interleaving effects that lead

00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:36.910
to these different companies,
it's amazing to think about.

00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:40.060
Since you mentioned
Xerox PARC, I've

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:42.020
always been fascinated
with their history.

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:45.160
So many core
technological inventions

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:48.850
came from there and from the
assemblage of amazing talent

00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:51.130
that Taylor brought together.

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:55.480
Yet they failed to
commercialize those inventions.

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.360
And so I'm curious, what's
your perspective on why

00:28:58.360 --> 00:28:59.740
did Xerox fail?

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:04.199
Was it some of this skepticism
towards Silicon Valley

00:29:04.199 --> 00:29:04.990
and the West Coast?

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:07.900
And also, how did Bob
Taylor think about that?

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:12.400
Was he troubled by the
fact that Xerox never

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:16.060
reaped the benefits
of the inventions that

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:18.100
came from his operation?

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:20.520
LESLIE BERLIN: Yeah,
so this is called--

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:22.840
"Fumbling the Future"
is the term everyone

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:27.310
uses for a very nasty
book about Xerox.

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:31.510
Xerox fumbled the future,
because the argument goes Apple

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:33.280
could have been Xerox's.

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:35.520
Adobe could have been Xerox's.

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:38.020
Microsoft, certainly
everything that

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:40.450
followed in the wake
of Windows, could have

00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:44.090
could have belonged to Xerox.

00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:45.270
So that's the argument.

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:47.840
And Alan's question is
how did how did Xerox

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:49.560
fumble the future?

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:51.500
So Xerox would very
quickly point out,

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:54.170
we did not fumble the future.

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:57.380
The printer, the laser
printer is another thing

00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:01.160
that was invented at
Xerox PARC, again,

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:05.630
with basically a refugee from
a different part of Xerox

00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:07.650
who had this idea to do this.

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:09.980
And they didn't want to do it.

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:12.480
And Taylor was like, come to us.

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:14.450
We will help you do this.

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:17.630
So Xerox commercialized
the laser printer

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:20.270
and made back way more
money than they ever

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:21.470
spent on Xerox PARC.

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:25.810
So they would completely say
that is an irrelevant question.

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:29.380
And it makes perfect sense that
a company whose entire business

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:32.680
model ran on paper would
actually commercialize the one

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:34.690
thing that came out of
this place that used up

00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:36.160
paper, which was a printer.

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:40.160
So they would object
to that, for sure--

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:43.160
and with some legitimacy.

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:51.030
I think that no one in
the world could hold on

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:54.700
to the talent and ideas that
were coming out of that place.

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:56.890
Silicon Valley has these places.

00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:59.290
So the first one was
Fairchild Semiconductor,

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:06.030
which was just this incredible
compression of brilliance.

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:08.380
So you look at the eight
founders of Fairchild,

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:12.010
and among them are Bob Noyce,
who co-invented the microchip,

00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:13.960
and his partner Gordon
Moore, who goes on

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:16.480
to start Intel with him,
and Eugene Kleiner, who

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:22.000
starts Kleiner Perkins, and Jean
Hoerni, who invents the planar

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.490
process, which is
underpinning, still,

00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:26.170
chip manufacturing today.

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:27.460
And you just keep going.

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:29.550
I mean, the people who
worked at Fairchild

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:32.360
include Don Valentine,
Charlie Sporck.

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:36.250
The companies that came out of
it are Intel, AMD, National.

00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:38.290
I mean, you can just keep going.

00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:40.780
Well, that company just
went [EXPLOSION SOUND]..

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:44.740
And it was like a seed
pod scattering its seeds

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:48.700
all over the area that then
became the chip industry.

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:50.767
Xerox PARC was another
one of those places.

00:31:50.767 --> 00:31:52.600
In more recent memory,
PayPal is another one

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:56.170
of those places that just sort
of does great things when it's

00:31:56.170 --> 00:32:00.040
together, and then the
founders and the key employees

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:02.770
kind of go on to populate
what happens next.

00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:05.280
And this just happens.

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:08.740
So Taylor could not
have given a darn

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:12.580
about whether his stuff
got commercialized.

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:17.410
He really felt, he believed
that the main interesting thing

00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:19.210
in this world was research.

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:22.900
If you want to waste your time
on marketing, and lawyers,

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:26.770
and money, and
finances, fine with him.

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:27.880
But he didn't care.

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:31.420
I mean, I asked him once
about the money that he made,

00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:34.180
because I just told
you all the people who

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:35.350
came from his company.

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:37.420
And they all loved him.

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:39.850
He undoubtedly had
the ability to invest

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:43.680
in all of the companies I just
laid out, on the ground floor.

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:45.340
And he had so little
interest in money

00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:47.980
that he started talking
about his 401(k) plan.

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:49.640
He didn't get what
I was talking about.

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:52.810
That just isn't what
kind of floated his boat.

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:55.450
But when his people
started leaving--

00:32:55.450 --> 00:32:59.614
because engineers and
these computer scientists,

00:32:59.614 --> 00:33:01.030
they don't want
to build something

00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:03.190
that gets buried and
no one ever uses it,

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:04.690
when they know it's incredible.

00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:08.140
They want it-- and when
his people started leaving,

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:09.140
then he lost it.

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:10.550
He was furious.

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:12.920
He was so angry.

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:14.610
ALAN MOSS: That's
so [INAUDIBLE]..

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:18.100
Yeah, and I think really one
of the world's great research

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:20.140
labs.

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:22.330
And some things
never change, right?

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:25.300
Engineers want their products
used by not only millions

00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:28.710
these days, but billions are
possible with the internet.

00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:30.460
LESLIE BERLIN: And a
number of the sort of

00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:33.400
graybeards even
now at Google who

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:36.430
are just sort of doing the
research, those are Taylor.

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:37.810
They worked for Bob Taylor.

00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:43.330
Bob hosted a tomato fest
in his yard every year.

00:33:43.330 --> 00:33:46.810
And it was like here come
the Turing Award winners,

00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:50.440
and here comes a major mind
behind Google Translate.

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:54.296
Here they're all just kind of
descending into his backyard.

00:33:54.296 --> 00:33:55.045
It was incredible.

00:33:55.045 --> 00:33:56.504
It was like a magnet.

00:33:56.504 --> 00:33:58.420
ALAN MOSS: Yeah, talk
about an eye for talent.

00:33:58.420 --> 00:33:58.770
LESLIE BERLIN: Yeah.

00:33:58.770 --> 00:33:59.770
ALAN MOSS: That's great.

00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:02.790
So I want to ask you about the
two women that you profile.

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:04.600
And obviously a lot
of talk these days

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:08.370
about women in Silicon
Valley, under-representation.

00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:11.480
I'd love to ask you
what's the same,

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:14.590
and what has changed
from earlier times

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:16.770
about being a woman
in tech and in Silicon

00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:18.107
Valley from your perspective.

00:34:18.107 --> 00:34:18.940
LESLIE BERLIN: Yeah.

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:21.130
I appreciate that
question being asked

00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:25.719
in that same versus different,
as opposed to better versus

00:34:25.719 --> 00:34:26.710
worse.

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:29.580
Because that's a really
tough question to answer.

00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:40.960
So I would say it has never
been easy for women in tech

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:44.020
in Silicon Valley, but
for different reasons

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:44.980
now than then.

00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:51.159
So the things that the women
in my book had to put up with--

00:34:51.159 --> 00:34:53.409
and I interviewed a number
of women, because the women

00:34:53.409 --> 00:34:54.639
were there.

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:56.651
I mean, they were
designing the video games,

00:34:56.651 --> 00:34:58.150
they were programming
the computers,

00:34:58.150 --> 00:35:01.510
they were inventing
the icons on the Mac.

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:08.200
But they were not brought
to the surface at all

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.550
in a lot of these stories.

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:12.850
So I talked to a lot
more women than who

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:15.740
are the subject of the book.

00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:18.460
And the things that they faced--

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:20.170
it would curl your hair.

00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:21.164
I mean, I can't even--

00:35:21.164 --> 00:35:23.830
it's one of those things where I
can't speak about this in front

00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:25.240
of a family-friendly audience.

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:28.477
And I didn't actually put
a lot of it in the book.

00:35:28.477 --> 00:35:30.310
But there are things
that I put in the book,

00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:34.630
like the literally
pornographic short story

00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:37.480
that Atari published, written
by one of its employees,

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.370
in the company newsletter.

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:43.950
And just hot tub parties--

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:46.270
board meetings were
held in hot tubs.

00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:49.690
I mean, it's behavior
that in some ways

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:51.700
looks super familiar
to the worst

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:55.030
stories we're hearing now.

00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:58.690
But what was really hard for
me to get my mind around--

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:00.130
really hard--

00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:03.040
is that this was
happening at a time

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:08.170
when the surrounding culture was
so different in a lot of ways

00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:09.280
from how it is now.

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:11.590
So in the mid '70s--

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:15.640
I think it was 1974 or
1975 before a woman,

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:18.670
a married woman, could just get
a credit card in her own name

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:21.550
without her
husband's permission.

00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:25.990
And it was 1980 before the EEOC
recognized sexual harassment

00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:27.590
in the workplace.

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:32.050
And so the overriding
culture was such

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:37.210
that when IBM showed women
using computers, which they

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:42.310
did in sort of their
flagship offices in New York,

00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:45.280
the women doing the work
because it was their job

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.440
were told that they were
being put in the window

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:49.090
because then it
would be clear to men

00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:51.170
that this was easy to do.

00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:57.230
And the women I talked
to, I would say,

00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:59.420
that was such explicit
sexual harassment!

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:02.250
I can't believe the things
that these people said and did.

00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:04.250
And they'd say, oh, no,
that was just so-and-so.

00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:05.420
He's a jerk.

00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:08.220
Or, no, you know,
everyone was doing that.

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:13.670
And so was it was
it harder for them?

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:16.910
I don't know, because the
expectations were so different.

00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:18.920
And these surroundings
were so different.

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:22.236
It really was a tough-- you
can hear from the way I'm

00:37:22.236 --> 00:37:23.110
talking about it now.

00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:26.470
It's still kind of hard for
me to get my mind around.

00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:29.470
Sandy Kurtzig said
that-- and Sandy Kurtzig,

00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:31.900
who was mistaken for a booth
babe because she was very

00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:35.590
beautiful, and told to go get
coffee for people when she was

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:39.250
the CEO that they were
trying to sell to--

00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:41.890
she said that the fact
that she was the boss

00:37:41.890 --> 00:37:43.750
made all the difference
in the world.

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:45.670
She was calling the shots.

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:48.580
And so I think that sort
of speaks to something

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:51.730
that a lot of people are
talking about now, as being one

00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:55.711
of the possible among the
constellation of many solutions

00:37:55.711 --> 00:37:56.710
we have to come up with.

00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:58.280
ALAN MOSS: It's more
women in leadership.

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:00.030
LESLIE BERLIN: Yeah,
that's exactly right.

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:02.920
And I think, kind of getting
back to that baton pass

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:06.800
image of Steve Jobs,
the question of, OK,

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.380
how do we make sure there are
a whole lot of batons going

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:12.760
all at once and that
they're being handed off,

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:18.430
not just to the usual suspects
and not just to the person who

00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:22.030
you wrote for the "Stanford
Review" with, but other people.

00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:23.950
How is that all
going to work out?

00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:27.040
And it's kind of incumbent
on us to figure that out.

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:27.750
ALAN MOSS: Yeah.

00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:28.420
Thank you.

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:31.300
Great perspective.

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:33.610
So the title's "Troublemakers."

00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:36.360
Why that title?

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:40.080
What's the common
attribute, perhaps,

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:41.610
that all of these
seven people have

00:38:41.610 --> 00:38:43.484
in terms of the trouble
that they're creating

00:38:43.484 --> 00:38:44.980
at this formative time?

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:46.010
LESLIE BERLIN: Yeah.

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:48.840
Titles are incredibly hard to
come up with, I have to say.

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:51.300
We had this one, then we
went to some other ones

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:53.640
that never quite sat right,
came back to this one.

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:58.657
The source of it
actually is another,

00:38:58.657 --> 00:38:59.740
I guess, Steve Jobs story.

00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:03.100
When he comes back
to Apple in 1996,

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:08.380
and then they bring out
the ad the next year that--

00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:11.690
it's "Here's to the crazy
ones, the troublemakers,

00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:14.440
the square pegs in round
holes," or however it goes.

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:16.520
It's in the front of the book.

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:19.930
And that really captured,
to me, the essence of what

00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:20.940
these people were doing.

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:26.910
One title we considered
was "Disruptors," which I'm

00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:28.530
really glad we didn't go with.

00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:33.900
But there was the
notion at this time that

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:37.950
to do what you needed to
do, you couldn't do it

00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:42.480
inside the existing boundaries
that kind of constrained you.

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:44.460
But there wasn't
the notion of, I'm

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:47.670
just going to blow
this up for no reason.

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:51.210
It was much more, I want
to accomplish this thing,

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:54.270
and here's how I have to do it.

00:39:57.490 --> 00:40:01.570
So Sandy Kurtzig, she couldn't
get money from anyone--

00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:03.520
she had to get it from her dad.

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:07.150
It wasn't some sort of
a I'm going to stick it

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:10.600
to the banks kind of idea.

00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:14.920
Or the whole notion
of dressing casually--

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:17.560
why is it that none of us
is in a suit right now?

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:21.440
Well, that wasn't some sort
of stick it to the man,

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:28.150
I don't want to be constrained
by the ideals of a broader

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:28.900
society.

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:30.490
It was that all of
these people were--

00:40:30.490 --> 00:40:32.620
most of them are coming
straight out of college.

00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:34.810
A lot of them were starting
companies straight out

00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:37.720
of college, and they
just started out in jeans

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:38.980
and kept going.

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:41.320
Or, they were these
computer scientists

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:44.330
who couldn't get time on
computers except late at night.

00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:50.530
And so that's a big part
of where the casual work

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:54.280
hours came from, too, was
that it just sort of naturally

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:57.880
flowed out of the
academic world that

00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:01.090
surrounded people and the kind
of loosey-goosey counterculture

00:41:01.090 --> 00:41:02.200
feature.

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:08.960
And in terms of what these
people had in common,

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:15.760
I would say they had an
unusual set of characteristics

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:16.810
in common.

00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:18.430
One was they were
simultaneously--

00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:21.310
they were audacious and
they were persistent.

00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:24.030
And sometimes those
two don't go together.

00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:27.240
You'll have the people who have
sort of the big out-there idea.

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:32.380
And Bob Noyce was one of these
people-- big out-there idea,

00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:33.880
and then he wants
to go out and find

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:35.624
the next big out-there idea.

00:41:35.624 --> 00:41:37.540
And Gordon Moore is
behind him like, OK, well,

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:38.290
that's a good one.

00:41:38.290 --> 00:41:39.880
That's a bad idea.

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:42.580
These people tended,
almost to a person,

00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:46.120
to be able to have the big
idea and to follow through

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:47.669
on the big idea,
or to find people

00:41:47.669 --> 00:41:48.710
who could follow through.

00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:50.450
So audacity and persistence.

00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:52.420
And I think the
third feature that I

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:56.470
would point to is an
appreciation of the team.

00:41:56.470 --> 00:42:01.120
None of these people set out
to be, or saw themselves as,

00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:06.310
an independent rock star, kind
of doing this for the adoring

00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:09.020
acolytes who are
their employees.

00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:13.600
I mean, it was very much of a
sense that we're all in this

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:14.240
together.

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:17.050
And I think those
three cover a lot,

00:42:17.050 --> 00:42:19.630
because their ancillary
characteristics

00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:23.380
that kind of fall out of
them are pretty significant.

00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:26.080
ALAN MOSS: Yeah.

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:30.280
So you talked about passing the
baton and other industries sort

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:31.540
of benefiting from each other.

00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:34.600
And the semiconductor industry,
sort of in the backdrop,

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:37.070
plays a very big part in
a lot of these companies.

00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:38.410
A lot of the talent--

00:42:38.410 --> 00:42:41.890
Mike Markkula, one example,
then going to Apple,

00:42:41.890 --> 00:42:43.340
but other examples like that.

00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:47.770
What was it about the early
experience in the semiconductor

00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:51.550
industry that set
these individuals up

00:42:51.550 --> 00:42:57.540
to become such great
technologists and executives

00:42:57.540 --> 00:42:58.720
in these other industries?

00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:01.210
LESLIE BERLIN: Yeah, so I
think that what the chip

00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:07.970
industry gave people was a
sort of understanding of,

00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:11.540
at that time, how this worked
for a very complicated idea,

00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:13.220
to become a business.

00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:16.280
I think also the
infrastructure that

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:19.520
was built up to support chip
entrepreneurs turned out

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:22.010
to be the exact
same infrastructure

00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:24.800
that these consumer electronics
companies plugged into,

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:27.980
that then biotech plugged
into, that still--

00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:31.760
I mean, think of how important
Sequoia is to this day.

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:34.670
People are still plugging
into these same networks

00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:35.810
that were set up.

00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:40.730
I think that something that the
semiconductor industry couldn't

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:44.160
help with was figuring out
how to sell to consumers.

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:49.710
So as you know, Apple
almost died in the period

00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:51.410
that Jobs was gone.

00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:56.630
And I think that they didn't
have anyone there who really

00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:59.252
knew how to sell to consumers.

00:43:59.252 --> 00:44:01.460
And one of the things that's
really interesting to me

00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:04.640
is they bring in John
Sculley, and everyone laughs.

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:07.650
Oh my god, this PepsiCo guy.

00:44:07.650 --> 00:44:08.630
What's he doing?

00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:10.546
But what they were trying
to do is figure out,

00:44:10.546 --> 00:44:15.380
how the heck do you
sell to a consumer?

00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:20.120
So the chip industry was
vitally important on one level,

00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:22.640
and on some level
this generation

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:25.310
had to get beyond the
one that came before.

00:44:25.310 --> 00:44:28.850
And that's just
the way it works.

00:44:28.850 --> 00:44:33.200
The example I always use is
of a grain of sand in a pearl

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:35.810
and how you can have
those sort of chips

00:44:35.810 --> 00:44:39.740
at the center, this
little grain there,

00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:44.690
but then you build these
layers around it and around it.

00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:47.340
Again, those generations
that I'm talking about.

00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:50.720
So now we're out here,
and it's very easy to,

00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:53.590
out where we are in this part,
this is a very big pearl.

00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:58.550
And it's hard to imagine
that yeah, back down

00:44:58.550 --> 00:45:00.800
at the core we're still
dealing with those chips.

00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:02.970
Because so much has
been added to it.

00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:05.630
So you do, you lean on it, but
you've got to move beyond it.

00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:07.920
ALAN MOSS: Yeah, that's great.

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:09.950
So I'd love to ask
you-- there's so

00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:12.010
many different great
personalities profiled

00:45:12.010 --> 00:45:13.580
in the book.

00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:16.640
If you had the opportunity
to work with one of them

00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:19.716
in their prime, who
would it be and why?

00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:25.670
LESLIE BERLIN: OK.

00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:30.140
If I had the opportunity to work
with, as a peer, one of them,

00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:32.660
it would be Fawn
Alvarez, because she

00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:35.975
is a firecracker and hilarious.

00:45:35.975 --> 00:45:39.150
And I really, really like her.

00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:45.980
I would have loved to
work for Bob Taylor--

00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:47.720
if he liked me.

00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:50.990
[LAUGHS] I would not have
wanted him to work for me.

00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:53.420
He was a very difficult
man to have work for you.

00:45:56.330 --> 00:45:58.250
But he created an environment.

00:45:58.250 --> 00:46:00.380
Everyone who worked
for him who loved

00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:03.140
him talks about this
sort of protected world

00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:08.450
that he created for innovation,
and creativity, and execution

00:46:08.450 --> 00:46:09.980
that I think just
would have been

00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:11.732
magnificent to be a part of.

00:46:11.732 --> 00:46:13.565
ALAN MOSS: Sounds like
if he didn't like you

00:46:13.565 --> 00:46:15.342
it wasn't quite as pleasant.

00:46:15.342 --> 00:46:16.550
LESLIE BERLIN: You were gone.

00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:18.212
ALAN MOSS: You were gone.

00:46:18.212 --> 00:46:19.640
Interesting.

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:23.750
And so we'll open up for
questions in just a minute.

00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:25.960
My last question will
be sort of turning

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:30.190
to some of the high-tech
companies today.

00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:32.500
Lots of the world's
most valuable companies

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:34.920
these days are in high tech.

00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:39.200
And so I'm curious what
companies like Google, Amazon,

00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:42.730
Facebook, name your
favorites, have learned

00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:43.890
from these predecessors.

00:46:43.890 --> 00:46:46.350
What's the foundation
that they're standing on

00:46:46.350 --> 00:46:48.570
that you think
should be recognized

00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:50.830
or maybe hasn't been
recognized as much

00:46:50.830 --> 00:46:53.207
and should be as we all grow up?

00:46:53.207 --> 00:46:54.790
LESLIE BERLIN: Well,
I mean, something

00:46:54.790 --> 00:47:00.160
that I think has been really
interesting that seems to still

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:03.910
be embedded in the DNA in
a lot of these companies

00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:09.020
is the founder continuing
on, whether he or she,

00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:10.620
or it's usually they--

00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:15.250
the lone founder
concept is just a myth.

00:47:15.250 --> 00:47:18.400
Almost all great companies are
founded by at least two people,

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:19.360
and sometimes more.

00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:24.260
But nonetheless,
that the founders

00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:29.390
have stuck around even when
the adult supervision comes in.

00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:32.180
I think that has
been a lesson that

00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:36.080
has been learned from watching
these companies where founders

00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:39.920
haven't stuck around,
and it's problematic.

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:44.810
I think, too, all of the
things that people associate

00:47:44.810 --> 00:47:49.670
with Silicon Valley perks
now, like broad distribution

00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:53.570
of stock options
is a great example.

00:47:53.570 --> 00:48:00.080
Even a lot of things
like free lunch, sports,

00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:04.580
sporting equipment, and
stuff happening on campus,

00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:08.460
a lot of that cultural stuff
came directly from this time

00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:09.710
period that I'm talking about.

00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:11.900
This company ROLM,
where Fawn Alvarez

00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:16.220
worked, which is now a parking
lot at the 49ers stadium,

00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:18.230
that company was incredible.

00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:25.850
They had jogging paths, and
they had a three-month paid

00:48:25.850 --> 00:48:28.130
sabbatical after
seven years of work.

00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:32.150
And all of these sorts of
benefits that I'm talking about

00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:34.520
speak to what I think
companies have really

00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:38.390
learned in the Valley,
which is that the people are

00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:42.800
the most easily
lost and the most

00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:44.600
valuable part of a company.

00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:47.210
And that, I think,
again, is something

00:48:47.210 --> 00:48:51.020
that's been embedded in the DNA
for a long time at this point.

00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:51.750
ALAN MOSS: Yeah.

00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:53.290
That's a great point.

00:48:53.290 --> 00:48:55.230
All right, up to your questions.

00:48:55.230 --> 00:48:56.570
We have a mic on the side.

00:48:56.570 --> 00:48:57.820
Please don't be bashful.

00:48:57.820 --> 00:48:58.570
LESLIE BERLIN: Hi.

00:48:58.570 --> 00:48:59.762
AUDIENCE: I really
enjoyed reading the book,

00:48:59.762 --> 00:49:01.220
and I think the
title is perfect.

00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:02.261
LESLIE BERLIN: Thank you.

00:49:02.261 --> 00:49:03.912
AUDIENCE: And I had
a question related

00:49:03.912 --> 00:49:05.919
to the last one
about a common thread

00:49:05.919 --> 00:49:08.080
through many of the stories.

00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:12.290
It seems to me that one story
that repeated over and over

00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:15.830
is a large organization or a
group of people either failing

00:49:15.830 --> 00:49:18.690
to see the value in
some of the opportunity

00:49:18.690 --> 00:49:22.140
or being unwilling to recognize
it, maybe in Stanford's case.

00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:28.190
Warner with Atari, Stanford
with these patents,

00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:30.880
HP, like you mentioned before,
with Apple-- this pattern seems

00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:33.046
to repeat over and over
again throughout the stories

00:49:33.046 --> 00:49:35.220
and creates the opportunity
for the troublemaker.

00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:37.860
So in the context of
today, we have a new set

00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:41.850
of large, powerful organizations
that clearly learned something.

00:49:41.850 --> 00:49:46.070
I'm curious whether they've
managed to sort of subsume

00:49:46.070 --> 00:49:46.920
the troublemakers?

00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:49.530
Is there something
structurally different now,

00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:52.130
or is it inevitable that
today's powerful organizations

00:49:52.130 --> 00:49:56.860
and institutions will miss the
next big valuable opportunity,

00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:59.700
just like you
described in your book?

00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:04.950
LESLIE BERLIN: So will
today's big companies

00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:08.940
be able to avoid the fate of--

00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:12.660
the classic innovator's dilemma,
as Clay Christensen puts it,

00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:14.370
right?

00:50:14.370 --> 00:50:18.000
So a lot of people would
say that the big companies

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.580
today are trying to
avoid this by acquiring

00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:22.830
all the small companies.

00:50:22.830 --> 00:50:26.700
Which, there's some real
debate as to whether that's

00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:29.540
a threat to Silicon
Valley's future,

00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:34.180
if all of the small companies
get eaten up by the big ones.

00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:38.400
It's a legitimate
question to ask, actually.

00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:44.700
But there's no way that great
companies aren't coming out

00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:50.160
of these big companies, and
won't continue to do so.

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:54.720
I think that the other thing
that so much of this innovation

00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:58.590
happening in software has
done because it's decreased

00:50:58.590 --> 00:51:00.870
the capital
requirements so much,

00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:04.140
and because it's made
it possible for people

00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:09.660
to work in lots of places that
are not all Silicon Valley,

00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:15.560
is the question of where
else are these ideas going

00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:16.540
to be coming from?

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:23.600
Because you know so many of
these companies that come out

00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:27.230
of bigger companies come because
there are a couple of, usually,

00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:29.739
engineers who can't
get something done

00:51:29.739 --> 00:51:31.280
at their big company,
and they decide

00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:32.960
to go off and do it themselves.

00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:35.300
And those people are finding
each other in other ways

00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:38.490
now, which I think
is interesting.

00:51:38.490 --> 00:51:42.260
I don't think that Silicon
Valley has obsoleted itself

00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:45.080
by making location unimportant.

00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:48.560
I think that the serendipity
factor of just sort of being

00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:51.260
able to walk down the street--

00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:54.050
I mean, we met in our
daughters' kindergarten classes

00:51:54.050 --> 00:51:57.650
a million years ago--

00:51:57.650 --> 00:51:59.270
there's no replacing that.

00:51:59.270 --> 00:52:02.780
I don't worry for Silicon
Valley's future or the future

00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:04.500
of innovation at all.

00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:07.760
I just think that the way that
I described there being multiple

00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:10.880
streams that can feed it,
I think those streams now

00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:13.730
have their origin points way--

00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:16.395
in various places
all over the world.

00:52:16.395 --> 00:52:17.880
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:52:20.850 --> 00:52:23.000
AUDIENCE: Yeah, mine's
kind of related,

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:30.860
thinking of the small companies
being consumed by larger ones.

00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:34.620
Don Norman came and talked
at Google about a year ago,

00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:36.962
and afterwards there was
a great discussion around,

00:52:36.962 --> 00:52:38.670
because he talked
about places like Xerox

00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:41.670
PARC and these wonderful
innovation centers

00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:44.144
and even before that or
around that time, Bell Labs.

00:52:44.144 --> 00:52:45.810
And he kind of bemoaned
the fact that he

00:52:45.810 --> 00:52:48.720
didn't know if that
was the case nowadays,

00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:50.810
if you have spaces like that.

00:52:50.810 --> 00:52:53.010
And if you do have spaces
like that, a lot of times

00:52:53.010 --> 00:52:55.530
they're under the umbrella
of a larger company.

00:52:55.530 --> 00:52:59.000
And so thinking back
to passing the batons,

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:02.010
there's been baton
passes from big company,

00:53:02.010 --> 00:53:04.980
or from a place like maybe
Apple that's already a bigger

00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:08.096
company to another big company.

00:53:08.096 --> 00:53:10.250
I'm wondering if Xerox
PARC, do you think,

00:53:10.250 --> 00:53:12.390
has passed the baton
to another place that

00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:16.410
can provide this kind of
exploratory environment

00:53:16.410 --> 00:53:20.180
for that type of
innovation that's maybe--

00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:21.720
well, I guess it
wasn't independent,

00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:24.375
because it was also
attached to Xerox, but yeah.

00:53:24.375 --> 00:53:25.250
LESLIE BERLIN: Right.

00:53:25.250 --> 00:53:27.320
Yeah, well, I mean
this is sort of--

00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:30.770
Google sponsors a bunch of
moon launch-y project kinds

00:53:30.770 --> 00:53:31.820
of things, right?

00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:36.230
I think that's something that
we see people being interested

00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:39.770
in at the big companies.

00:53:39.770 --> 00:53:43.670
I was on a panel
with an early hacker,

00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:46.020
and someone asked a
question similar to this.

00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:49.004
And so I'll just sort of
parrot back what he said,

00:53:49.004 --> 00:53:51.170
because I thought it was
interesting-- not something

00:53:51.170 --> 00:53:52.260
I really know about.

00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:55.190
He was talking about all the
maker spaces and the hacker

00:53:55.190 --> 00:54:00.080
spaces, and the
ability of people

00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:05.240
to do real innovation without
needing the underlying

00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:10.220
infrastructure of a big
company to sponsor the work.

00:54:10.220 --> 00:54:15.020
Now, the question of
what can that impact be--

00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:16.837
I don't know.

00:54:16.837 --> 00:54:18.920
One of the first articles
I wrote for the New York

00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:26.210
Times was about a guy, Johnny
Chung Lee, who had hacked a Wii

00:54:26.210 --> 00:54:31.430
and then turned it into a very
cheap whiteboard for schools,

00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:34.940
and how the way he got
that invention out there

00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:36.530
was through YouTube.

00:54:36.530 --> 00:54:40.490
And how this had completely
bypassed the typical research

00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:46.130
structure of a
person working alone

00:54:46.130 --> 00:54:48.530
or with a small team in
an academic environment

00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:51.740
and then waiting forever to get
your paper accepted somewhere

00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:53.570
for publication, and
get it peer reviewed,

00:54:53.570 --> 00:54:56.630
get it out there where, like,
four people will read it.

00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:59.030
But this had created
a completely new way

00:54:59.030 --> 00:55:01.100
to disseminate information,
in the same way we've

00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:03.380
seen with Twitter and
all of the other things

00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:09.830
that have created this mass
explosion of information.

00:55:09.830 --> 00:55:12.130
And then he went on to go
to Microsoft Research, which

00:55:12.130 --> 00:55:13.010
is interesting.

00:55:13.010 --> 00:55:14.990
I think he's moved
on since then.

00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:17.120
So I think there are
opportunities out

00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:19.096
there for sure.

00:55:19.096 --> 00:55:21.185
AUDIENCE: Great, thank you.

00:55:21.185 --> 00:55:22.810
AUDIENCE: So I've
heard a lot of people

00:55:22.810 --> 00:55:26.330
say that modern devices
seem to be a lot less

00:55:26.330 --> 00:55:28.650
tinkerable and
hackerable. [? Usual ?]

00:55:28.650 --> 00:55:31.210
computers you're programming
in BASIC yourself.

00:55:31.210 --> 00:55:34.810
Now it seems like
the interaction flow,

00:55:34.810 --> 00:55:36.860
especially if
[? you're going to just ?] use

00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:39.070
certain apps in predefined ways.

00:55:39.070 --> 00:55:42.490
So for the future
talent pipeline,

00:55:42.490 --> 00:55:45.490
how do we keep raising this
next generation of tinkerers

00:55:45.490 --> 00:55:48.702
who are reverse engineering
their electronics and so forth?

00:55:48.702 --> 00:55:51.340
LESLIE BERLIN: Yeah.

00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:54.820
So I will say this has
been a concern for a while.

00:55:54.820 --> 00:55:59.030
The people even coming
straight out of the--

00:55:59.030 --> 00:56:01.580
well, honestly,
people were worried

00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:05.810
when we moved away from cars.

00:56:05.810 --> 00:56:08.060
This is something that I
really remember Bob Noyce had

00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:10.340
to talk to his family about.

00:56:10.340 --> 00:56:14.510
Because you can see how
to take apart an engine,

00:56:14.510 --> 00:56:16.250
but what about with these chips?

00:56:16.250 --> 00:56:17.520
You can't do that with chips.

00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:19.040
You can't do that
with electronics.

00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:23.660
So the bar keeps getting raised.

00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:25.850
That said, it's a
legitimate question.

00:56:25.850 --> 00:56:37.670
And I think that those
kids are learning

00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:41.060
the same kind of creativity
within a differently defined

00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:42.560
set of limits.

00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:47.540
And I don't know
the answer of, how

00:56:47.540 --> 00:56:51.620
do you crack those limits
open further to kind of return

00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:56.060
to the level of
something more tangible?

00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:58.970
But it is an important question.

00:56:58.970 --> 00:57:03.890
Because having the playground so
tightly defined by other people

00:57:03.890 --> 00:57:05.660
is troublesome.

00:57:08.730 --> 00:57:12.190
I don't know how it's
going to play out.

00:57:12.190 --> 00:57:16.530
I think that a lot of
people see real hope

00:57:16.530 --> 00:57:18.237
for sort of a freer internet.

00:57:18.237 --> 00:57:20.070
I know you were talking
on the device level,

00:57:20.070 --> 00:57:23.820
but on the broader level.

00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:27.090
In the blockchain,
as some place that

00:57:27.090 --> 00:57:32.560
has less control,
less different spaces.

00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:34.530
I don't know if we could
come up with something

00:57:34.530 --> 00:57:37.740
analogous beyond sort
of typical open source

00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:40.689
stuff on a smaller level.

00:57:40.689 --> 00:57:42.480
ALAN MOSS: Comes down
to open source versus

00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:44.919
walled garden sort of debates.

00:57:44.919 --> 00:57:46.585
LESLIE BERLIN: Do you
have any thoughts?

00:57:46.585 --> 00:57:48.380
AUDIENCE: Yeah, actually
I'm glad you mentioned

00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:50.254
the blockchain, because,
it's kind of cliché,

00:57:50.254 --> 00:57:53.010
but that was going to be-- if I
were to ask a second question,

00:57:53.010 --> 00:57:54.990
it was going to be your
thoughts on cryptocurrencies.

00:57:54.990 --> 00:57:56.948
LESLIE BERLIN: Yeah, I'm
passing on my thoughts

00:57:56.948 --> 00:57:57.930
on cryptocurrencies.

00:57:57.930 --> 00:57:58.970
I don't know enough.

00:57:58.970 --> 00:57:59.590
Yeah.

00:57:59.590 --> 00:58:00.530
AUDIENCE: All right, thanks.

00:58:00.530 --> 00:58:01.363
LESLIE BERLIN: Sure.

00:58:04.229 --> 00:58:04.770
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:58:04.770 --> 00:58:08.776
Thank you very much for your
amazing book about the story

00:58:08.776 --> 00:58:10.300
of Silicon Valley.

00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:15.365
My question is, just like
Fairchild popped and seeded

00:58:15.365 --> 00:58:19.470
the semiconductor
evolution, do you

00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:24.190
see not a popping, but seeds
from Silicon Valley being

00:58:24.190 --> 00:58:26.590
planted in other areas
throughout the world?

00:58:26.590 --> 00:58:29.298
And would that perhaps
be an interesting story

00:58:29.298 --> 00:58:30.817
for a next book?

00:58:30.817 --> 00:58:31.650
LESLIE BERLIN: Yeah.

00:58:31.650 --> 00:58:33.600
So absolutely.

00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:37.380
I think that the
circulation of people

00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:40.440
in and out of Silicon Valley
from other parts of the world

00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:46.650
is completely bringing the model
to other parts of the world

00:58:46.650 --> 00:58:50.430
and refining the model
here in the Valley.

00:58:50.430 --> 00:58:53.220
There's an interesting book,
it came out many years ago,

00:58:53.220 --> 00:58:55.590
by a woman named
AnnaLee Saxenian called,

00:58:55.590 --> 00:58:59.880
"The New Argonauts"
that talks about exactly

00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:03.870
this, the sort of people who
come, the sort of communities

00:59:03.870 --> 00:59:06.660
that are made by different
immigrant groups.

00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:10.130
And then they go back.

00:59:10.130 --> 00:59:15.240
And again, I would really
point to if Silicon Valley,

00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:17.370
if the United
States, wants to hold

00:59:17.370 --> 00:59:21.420
on to its edge as
an innovator, we

00:59:21.420 --> 00:59:23.850
need to be doing what we
can to make sure that people

00:59:23.850 --> 00:59:27.885
have an incentive to stay here.

00:59:27.885 --> 00:59:30.570
I think another vector,
before I forget,

00:59:30.570 --> 00:59:32.880
other than the entrepreneurs
themselves, is, of course,

00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:39.000
a lot of the venture companies
have built arms or offices

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.190
around the world.

00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:43.980
The one approach that
I think is probably not

00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:45.780
going to work very
well is sometimes

00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:48.060
you see these top-down
government efforts

00:59:48.060 --> 00:59:52.260
in other parts of the world to
sort of force a Silicon Valley.

00:59:52.260 --> 00:59:54.300
We're going to
build a tech region.

00:59:54.300 --> 00:59:56.900
If you build it, they will come.

00:59:56.900 --> 00:59:59.672
That doesn't really
seem to work.

00:59:59.672 --> 01:00:03.461
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

01:00:03.461 --> 01:00:05.252
AUDIENCE: I love the
history of the Valley.

01:00:05.252 --> 01:00:06.954
I love the stories.

01:00:06.954 --> 01:00:08.330
So thanks for sharing those.

01:00:08.330 --> 01:00:11.375
So one thing is as true in
this current environment

01:00:11.375 --> 01:00:14.640
of mega companies like Facebook,
and Google, and others,

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:16.910
that it seems to be
that the start-ups are

01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:20.900
aspiring more to being a
target, acquisition target,

01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:24.666
than really becoming a
strong, independent-- like

01:00:24.666 --> 01:00:29.965
entrepreneurialism seems to
be not so much at present.

01:00:29.965 --> 01:00:34.969
So any comment on how do
you bring the culture back?

01:00:34.969 --> 01:00:39.680
It seems to
[INAUDIBLE] is somewhat

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:42.600
[INAUDIBLE] in this kind
of current environment.

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:44.400
LESLIE BERLIN: Mhm.

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:53.200
So I think I might take a little
bit of issue with that premise.

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:56.740
I actually think there are a
lot of entrepreneurs out there

01:00:56.740 --> 01:01:01.720
who are aspiring to build
great, great companies

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:04.610
for the long haul.

01:01:04.610 --> 01:01:09.640
I think that those
aspirations can [LAUGHS]

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:13.990
evaporate when someone offers
enormous sums of money.

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:22.300
Something that came through
in this book again and again

01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:24.100
and again and again
and again and again

01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:28.420
is how hard it is to start
a company, how hard it

01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:31.780
is to get this off the ground,
even with all the support

01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:33.160
that you have.

01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:36.510
How many people are in
your camp rooting for you?

01:01:36.510 --> 01:01:39.800
However great your network
is, it's super hard.

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:43.240
And I don't think
anybody would ever

01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:48.280
make it through the sixth
consecutive day of 20

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:52.060
hours of work if they were
like, someday someone else

01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:53.920
is going to run this all.

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:58.450
It's just not something
that people aspire to,

01:01:58.450 --> 01:02:00.050
I think, as a group.

01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:04.580
I think you can get very tired,
and money can look very good.

01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:06.940
And it becomes
something you want.

01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:10.630
But I think it's pretty
cynical, let's put it that way,

01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:13.030
to start sort of
like, my dream is

01:02:13.030 --> 01:02:14.830
to build an acquisition target.

01:02:14.830 --> 01:02:15.370
You know?

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:20.880
AUDIENCE: I really
liked your analogy

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:25.874
about the seeds that
spread, the pot of seeds

01:02:25.874 --> 01:02:28.290
that spread, and in grow the
next generation of companies,

01:02:28.290 --> 01:02:30.660
so like the PayPal Mafia--

01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:31.480
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:32.170 --> 01:02:36.820
--at Xerox PARC, Fairchild.

01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:41.100
I was curious, is
there a common strain

01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:42.450
in how these groups form?

01:02:42.450 --> 01:02:44.670
Do you think they're just
incredible individuals who

01:02:44.670 --> 01:02:46.510
sort of find each other?

01:02:46.510 --> 01:02:50.460
Or do you think there's a
way of working together,

01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:55.930
like a worldview, that's learned
once they sort of come together

01:02:55.930 --> 01:02:58.737
under some great leader,
or something like that?

01:02:58.737 --> 01:03:00.570
LESLIE BERLIN: Ah,
that's a superb question.

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:09.370
The three examples I cited,
Fairchild, PARC, and PayPal,

01:03:09.370 --> 01:03:17.380
what they have in common is that
those people, in every case,

01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:20.440
knew each other
before they got there.

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:24.970
So if anyone's read the new
book "Brotopia," which I think

01:03:24.970 --> 01:03:28.930
is a very interesting
and good book,

01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:31.660
one of the things that
it really points to

01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:38.950
is who gets left out when you're
only bringing into your culture

01:03:38.950 --> 01:03:44.220
people who you know from
a previous experience.

01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:47.400
And there's really smart
reasons to do that.

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:50.850
Namely, you guys are
all thinking similarly.

01:03:50.850 --> 01:03:54.600
You get to skip the
acculturation step, because oh,

01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:57.060
we all worked together at
Shockley Semiconductor-- let's

01:03:57.060 --> 01:03:58.770
go start Fairchild.

01:03:58.770 --> 01:04:05.460
Or, we all got contracts from
ARPA under this guy Bob Taylor,

01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:07.699
and he likes the
way we think, we

01:04:07.699 --> 01:04:09.990
like the way he thinks, so
we're all going to just come

01:04:09.990 --> 01:04:11.400
together, start PARC.

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:13.770
Or, we were all at
Stanford together

01:04:13.770 --> 01:04:17.590
sort of on the conservative
paper, and such--

01:04:17.590 --> 01:04:21.310
except for Reid Hoffman, who
was kind of like their foil.

01:04:21.310 --> 01:04:24.480
Now let's all go and
start PayPal together.

01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:28.720
So that is something that
they've had in common.

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:31.890
Google is an interesting
counter-example

01:04:31.890 --> 01:04:36.600
to that, because
Google, for example,

01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:40.380
included women early
on, very early on.

01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:48.060
People like Wojcicki and Marissa
Mayer and Sheryl Sandberg.

01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:54.030
So that's a story of a different
potential model than the,

01:04:54.030 --> 01:04:57.460
we're all in sync.

01:04:57.460 --> 01:05:00.846
And it appears to have worked.

01:05:00.846 --> 01:05:02.054
ALAN MOSS: One more question.

01:05:02.054 --> 01:05:02.540
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:05:02.540 --> 01:05:04.248
Along the lines of
where you were talking

01:05:04.248 --> 01:05:06.816
about how these companies
like Fairchild Semiconductor,

01:05:06.816 --> 01:05:08.880
they grow then they pop.

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:12.230
I'm just thinking right now,
the dominant companies that

01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:15.760
are in the area, like
Google, Facebook, Apple,

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:17.290
they're just taking--

01:05:17.290 --> 01:05:19.980
we're just taking so much real
estate all over the place.

01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:24.420
I remember here used to
be [INAUDIBLE] we have.

01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:26.615
I was with a company
[INAUDIBLE] previously.

01:05:26.615 --> 01:05:29.300
Now Google's taken
all those campuses.

01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:31.770
Do you see any dangers
or concerns that,

01:05:31.770 --> 01:05:34.815
if Google were to
pop-- fortunately it

01:05:34.815 --> 01:05:36.590
won't, hopefully--

01:05:36.590 --> 01:05:38.540
all this real estate
that it controls,

01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:40.715
all the land, and all
the different buildings,

01:05:40.715 --> 01:05:44.179
what would happen to it?

01:05:44.179 --> 01:05:44.970
LESLIE BERLIN: Wow.

01:05:44.970 --> 01:05:46.880
So now we're getting into--

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:48.800
the beautiful thing
about being a historian

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:50.885
is you never have to
predict the future.

01:05:50.885 --> 01:05:56.550
[LAUGHS] I don't know.

01:05:56.550 --> 01:06:01.880
I can tell you that one thing
Silicon Valley history teaches

01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:09.800
quite well is that great things
happen in economic declines.

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:12.020
So you don't have to
have any customers to buy

01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:14.100
your stuff when you're
starting the company.

01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:15.900
You're trying to get it going.

01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:18.740
So all of a sudden, office
space would be cheaper.

01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:21.110
You would have people
who are highly trained

01:06:21.110 --> 01:06:24.320
but are not employed.

01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:27.710
I think that you might
see another flowering

01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:30.960
of innovation.

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:32.610
ALAN MOSS: Scarcity
breeds clarity.

01:06:32.610 --> 01:06:33.581
LESLIE BERLIN: Exactly.

01:06:33.581 --> 01:06:34.830
ALAN MOSS: Yeah, that's great.

01:06:34.830 --> 01:06:35.770
Awesome.

01:06:35.770 --> 01:06:38.130
Well, Leslie, thank
you so much for sharing

01:06:38.130 --> 01:06:41.700
your incredible insight
and providing perspective

01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:45.065
