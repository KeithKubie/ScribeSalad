[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.971 --> 00:00:08.470
JASON ANDREAS: Please welcome
to Google Detroit, Mrs. Kristi

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:08.970
Hedges.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.155
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.220
Well, thank you
again for joining us.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.470
We appreciate it.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.900
I mentioned in the bio intro--

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.745
so you wrote a book previously
called "The Power of Presence."

00:00:21.745 --> 00:00:22.620
KRISTI HEDGES: Right.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.530
JASON ANDREAS: And this book is
called "The Inspiration Code."

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.810
Are you able of kick things
off by just telling us

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.510
a little bit about how those
two things or those two books

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.640
are similar and perhaps
how they're different?

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.920
Presence versus inspiration--
they tie together.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.480
But there's obviously
differences between them.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.880
Maybe kick things off with that,
and then, we'll go from there.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:39.963
KRISTI HEDGES: Yeah, sure.

00:00:39.963 --> 00:00:42.810
So, let me start by saying how
I ended up writing this book.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:43.070
JASON ANDREAS: Absolutely.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.680
KRISTI HEDGES:
Because that's how

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.930
they're kind of tied together.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:45.900
JASON ANDREAS: Sure.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.983
KRISTI HEDGES: So I wrote
"The Power of Presence,"

00:00:47.983 --> 00:00:49.472
and it came out in 2011.

00:00:49.472 --> 00:00:51.180
And that's really a
book about influence.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.620
How do we use our presence to
influence situations around us?

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.200
And as I was out talking
to groups about that,

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.720
I would start by asking
them this simple question

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.840
to warm up the audience a
little bit, get people talking.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.320
And that was, who inspired
you, and what did they do?

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.944
And I was trying to
map those answers

00:01:09.944 --> 00:01:11.610
and those characteristics
back to people

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.350
who had presence and
made this real life

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.130
connection for people.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.419
Well, what I noticed when
I asked that question,

00:01:17.419 --> 00:01:18.960
pretty immediately
it was-- no matter

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.760
how tired people
were-- maybe it's

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.514
the day after a holiday
weekend or something like that.

00:01:23.514 --> 00:01:25.680
When they would start talking
about these people who

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.569
inspired them, their
faces would light up.

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:29.110
And there would be
all this animation

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.740
and energy in the room.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.060
And people would be
literally transformed

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.900
energetically in front of
me, and that happened again

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.280
and again and again and again.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.830
And people would talk as part
of the exercise about what

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.390
these people did.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.960
And I noticed that they
communicated in certain ways

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.136
that inspired people.

00:01:47.136 --> 00:01:48.510
I mean, to even
remember things--

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.440
and you guys have them now.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.940
Somebody said something to you
that just hit you just right.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.565
And those words, you
carry them around.

00:01:53.565 --> 00:01:55.080
And you use them
when you need them.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.560
And they fortify you when
you need guidance and all

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.254
those kind of good things.

00:02:00.254 --> 00:02:02.670
And I just started writing
down, what did these people do?

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.010
And I found that these patterns
emerged again and again.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.280
And that led me to
put them together

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.070
in "The Inspiration Code."

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.110
But as I looked at those--
because I was usually

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.860
there speaking to groups
to talk about presence,

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.210
to talk about influence,
which is really important.

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.910
But what we-- in leadership
development programs,

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.940
we often rely so
much on influence

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.130
that we leave out this other
piece about engagement,

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.020
which is inspiration.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.289
And if you think about that, we
need both of them as leaders,

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:32.330
but they go hand-in-hand.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.242
I mean, none of us go home
after a day of work and say,

00:02:35.242 --> 00:02:36.450
I had such a great day today.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.770
I was influenced all day long.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.560
I mean that-- it
feels different.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.790
Influence is done to us.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.040
But we would go home and
say, I was so inspired today.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.300
I had a great day.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.200
Inspiration comes from within.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.230
So I really wanted to
figure how to create

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.570
those feelings in
people in the workplace,

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.697
because we need more of it.

00:02:52.697 --> 00:02:54.030
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.880
You-- so one of the really
interesting things that I read

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.890
about in the book
is this kind of--

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.600
the quiet influence
of listening.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.808
So we talk about inspiration.

00:03:01.808 --> 00:03:04.380
And when do you think about
an inspirational person,

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.874
you think of a great speaker
or somebody with presence.

00:03:07.874 --> 00:03:09.540
One of the things you
mentioned, though,

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.360
was one of the most cited
behaviors of somebody who

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.661
is inspiring is the
ability to listen.

00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:16.410
Can you talk a little
bit more about that?

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.670
It seems like a
simple thing, right?

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.545
Listening-- everyone
should be able to do it.

00:03:19.545 --> 00:03:21.810
But it's not really that
easy of a concept to handle.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.730
A lot of people aren't
good at listening.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.570
You talk about how listening
plays into inspiration

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.100
and also how we can work on
becoming better listeners

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.100
in order to be more
inspirational with the folks

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.910
that we lead.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.350
KRISTI HEDGES: Yeah, that
was a surprise to me.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.933
So as part of the
research that I did,

00:03:35.933 --> 00:03:39.220
I also did quantitative research
that I commissioned on my own.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.280
And I looked at, what
are the behaviors that

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.740
were most impactful to people
in terms of inspiration?

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.200
And the number one
behavior was listening.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.170
And I also heard in these
discussions people would say,

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.000
that person was there for me.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.410
They made time for me.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.025
They were focused on me.

00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:55.650
That came up again
and again and again.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.108
So it was clear
that there was just

00:03:57.108 --> 00:04:00.300
something magical about when
somebody creates a space for us

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.590
through strong listening skills.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.150
So whether you're in sales or
whether you're leading teams,

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.010
when we listen to
people, it's a sign

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.450
of respect for their opinion.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.580
It's a sign that we care.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.990
There is a great quote that,
"The currency of love is time."

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:20.160
And I would say the currency
of respect is attention.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.710
So when we give people our
attention, it feels different.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.930
But we're not very good
listeners as a group.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.010
We learned to listen
quick and listen halfway,

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.790
so we get done what
we need to get done.

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.390
And that's why when somebody
really listens to us,

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.017
it's like the record skips that
it just feels quite different.

00:04:33.017 --> 00:04:33.850
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.090
And I think another concept
you talked about too

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.230
is authenticity.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.250
KRISTI HEDGES: Mm-hmm.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.083
JASON ANDREAS: We've
all encountered leaders

00:04:40.083 --> 00:04:43.560
who most likely read
a leadership book,

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.994
and that's pretty much it.

00:04:44.994 --> 00:04:46.410
But there's no
authenticity to it,

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.540
because they're just
spitting back something

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.170
that they read about
being a powerful speaker

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.240
or giving somebody
a strong handshake.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.582
That doesn't necessarily
equate to authentic leadership.

00:04:56.582 --> 00:04:58.540
It's just something they
read about in a look--

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.039
in a book.

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:02.640
And I think listening is
one of those aspects that

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.580
actually conveys authenticity.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.980
Can you talk about this concept
of authenticity as well?

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.060
Not just reading a
book about leadership

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.210
and spitting it back
to your employees,

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.510
but how you actually can become
an authentic leader in addition

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.210
to the listening that we talked
about-- some other concepts

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:22.035
around that.

00:05:22.035 --> 00:05:23.910
KRISTI HEDGES: Yeah,
well I mean, listening--

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.390
I mean authenticity really is--

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.145
it's about trust when
it comes down to it.

00:05:28.145 --> 00:05:29.770
You know, we trust
people who are real.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.920
So if we don't feel like
we actually know someone,

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.760
then it's very difficult for
us to really invest in them.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.530
But authenticity
is tricky at work.

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.885
People can be too
authentic as well.

00:05:39.885 --> 00:05:41.260
So it's just trying
to figure out

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.250
with that fine line
is of you're authentic

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.200
enough so that we know you.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.690
And yet, you're also
aware of your surroundings

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.360
and what the situation
will support.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.181
And so with
authenticity what I--

00:05:53.181 --> 00:05:55.680
what I often will tell people
is that we have to-- it really

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.879
has to start within you.

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:59.170
What is your intention for
what you want to get across?

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.084
And being very clear about what
I call your personal presence

00:06:03.084 --> 00:06:05.375
brand, which is really your
values worn on the outside.

00:06:05.375 --> 00:06:06.540
How do I want to show up?

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.940
How do I want people
to perceive me?

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.890
How do I want to show
what's most important to me?

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.599
If you're very clear
about that going in,

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:15.139
then you're much
more likely for that

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:17.430
to come out in an authentic
way, because it really

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.040
is about the core of who you
want to be in that situation.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.670
But situational
awareness matters too,

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.227
so also knowing what those--

00:06:26.227 --> 00:06:28.560
the rule of support, because
sometimes we get into too--

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.870
you get too much information,
the TMI situation,

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.710
where, whoa, your authenticity
is screaming at me here.

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.250
[INAUDIBLE] kind
of back it back up.

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.790
JASON ANDREAS: So when
we talk about TMI,

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:41.220
sometimes emotion comes
into-- to the discussion

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:45.100
as well in terms of
leadership and authenticity.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:49.380
Google is known for coming up
with this concept of Search

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:55.200
Inside Yourself, which is this
concept based on mindfulness

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.220
and emotion within
the workplace.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.180
And not a lot of companies were
really thinking about this.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.580
Like, how does this play
into kind of the ecosystem

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:03.690
of the workplace?

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.360
But I think it's
a core-- emotion

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.010
is a core aspect of
leadership that a lot of folks

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:09.660
don't necessarily grasp.

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.870
How do you-- how do you
tie emotion into leadership

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.940
without being
unauthentic-- like,

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:20.710
how do you do it in a way
that displays sincerity?

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:22.680
Can you talk a little
bit about the importance

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:27.520
of mindfulness or emotion within
the aspects of leadership?

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.005
KRISTI HEDGES: Yeah, well the--

00:07:29.005 --> 00:07:31.830
I just wrote a piece for a
"Harvard Business Review,"

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:33.810
which is, I believe,
going online this week,

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:34.560
called, "Go Ahead.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.210
Get Emotional at Work."

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:37.000
And--

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:37.970
JASON ANDREAS: Perfect.

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:38.930
Perfect timing.

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.400
KRISTI HEDGES: And
the idea was the fact

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.320
that in my world with coaching
and leaders that I coach,

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.570
it's not that people are
bringing too much emotion in.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:48.870
They're not bringing
enough emotion in.

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:51.390
And emotion is really
a signal for us.

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:54.660
It's a trigger to understand
really what you care about.

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:57.300
So if a leader comes in
and they're overly stoic,

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:58.920
it's like what's there?

00:07:58.920 --> 00:07:59.940
Knock, knock, knock.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.850
You're looking for what
with the real story is.

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:04.470
And so emotion is
actually something

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:06.417
we want to be very
strategic about as leaders.

00:08:06.417 --> 00:08:08.250
Because if we want
people to feel something,

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:09.000
we have to bring it.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.350
So if I want people
to get excited,

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:11.974
I have to bring
excitement into a room.

00:08:11.974 --> 00:08:13.560
If I want people
to feel serious,

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.720
I have to bring
seriousness into a room.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.050
So knowing what emotion
you're trying to impart

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:21.990
and instead of trying to either
have it be an afterthought,

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:24.870
to make it really important
part of your communication

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:26.080
is really what that's about.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.479
So it's knowing
what that emotion is

00:08:28.479 --> 00:08:30.270
and then being willing
to put it out there.

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:33.090
And instead of--
lot of us come up

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:35.429
through the ranks
learning that we

00:08:35.429 --> 00:08:36.720
want to be unemotional at work.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:37.636
We don't want to show.

00:08:37.636 --> 00:08:40.650
We want to be always stoic,
have the same demeanor

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:42.396
no matter what
people throw at us.

00:08:42.396 --> 00:08:43.770
And as an individual
contributor,

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:45.510
we get rewarded for that.

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:48.360
And we're told, oh, gosh,
you can give Jason anything.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.694
He's gonna-- he always has a
smile on his face no matter

00:08:50.694 --> 00:08:51.735
what you dump on his lap.

00:08:51.735 --> 00:08:53.250
JASON ANDREAS: It's
very true, yeah.

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:54.630
KRISTI HEDGES: And then
you get to be a leader,

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:55.830
and that doesn't
work so well anymore.

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:58.440
Because you have to use
emotion to get people excited,

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.307
to make them feel something,
and being able to actually think

00:09:01.307 --> 00:09:03.390
about, oh, gosh, how should
I be emotional at work

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:05.866
versus not having
emotion be something

00:09:05.866 --> 00:09:06.990
that we really think about.

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:08.930
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah I
feel like we-- sometimes

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:10.680
at Google-- encounter
the opposite of that

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.096
as well, though,
where when you're

00:09:12.096 --> 00:09:15.300
an individual contributor--
an individual contributor

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.919
or you're newer to the company,
you bring more emotion.

00:09:17.919 --> 00:09:19.210
You're like, oh, I'm at Google.

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:20.437
This is exciting.

00:09:20.437 --> 00:09:21.520
People are more emotional.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.353
They're more emotional
in their interactions

00:09:23.353 --> 00:09:24.480
with their managers.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.150
But then as you progress and you
become part of the leadership

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.340
team-- maybe you're a
manager, or you manage a team,

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:30.480
or you're a director--

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.030
you feel like you have to be
more serious and more stoic.

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:35.340
And you actually
remove the emotion,

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:38.430
because you want to be
respected and authoritative

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:41.100
versus an individual contributor
that's a little bit more

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:41.900
free and open.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:45.480
Do you see that as well as being
a concept that comes across

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.250
in inspiration
where when folks get

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.083
into a position of
leadership, they actually

00:09:49.083 --> 00:09:51.211
lose some of those
traits of a good leader,

00:09:51.211 --> 00:09:52.710
because they feel
they have to based

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:55.552
on maybe an antiquated
vision of what a leader is.

00:09:55.552 --> 00:09:57.010
KRISTI HEDGES:
Yeah, well, exactly.

00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:59.343
And that's why I love that
example where people come in,

00:09:59.343 --> 00:10:00.752
and they're like all gung-ho.

00:10:00.752 --> 00:10:02.960
And as a leader, they're
like let's tamp-- let's tamp

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.094
that down.

00:10:04.094 --> 00:10:06.010
Gosh, we don't want our
leaders to be excited.

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:07.200
JASON ANDREAS: Exactly, yeah.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.616
KRISTI HEDGES: And it's kind
of funny as we talk about it.

00:10:09.616 --> 00:10:11.610
But you see that
play out, there's--

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:14.450
as you say that, it just-- it
makes me think about how we

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:16.190
think about-- we equate joy--

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:18.770
joyfulness at work with naivete.

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:21.509
And that doesn't
serve us very well.

00:10:21.509 --> 00:10:24.050
Because wouldn't it be great to
have leaders who are actually

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:26.240
joyful about the
work that they did

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.510
versus coming in and feeling
like it's a grind every day?

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:31.640
That doesn't inspire anybody.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:34.010
So it's really
thinking-- again, we

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:36.680
don't think about things on
an emotional plane very much.

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.154
But if you just think
about it as a leader

00:10:39.154 --> 00:10:40.820
and play around with
the idea of emotion

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:43.940
as being a critical part
of how you communicate,

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.647
that opens up a lot that maybe
we don't even think we have.

00:10:46.647 --> 00:10:47.480
JASON ANDREAS: Sure.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.860
Can you talk-- kind of tying
that topic together too--

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:54.390
so your book talks a lot
about inspiring others.

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:57.170
Can you maybe turn
that inward a bit

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:58.820
and talk about how
leaders of folks

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.420
here in the room, folks that are
watching who are in positions

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:07.040
of influence or leadership,
how they can inspire themselves

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.970
from a leadership perspective?

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:11.680
How can they-- if maybe they're
one of these more stoic leaders

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:12.800
and something just--

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.080
the last comment you made--
something snapped them.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:15.560
They said, hey, wait.

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.090
I'm one of these stoic leaders.

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:20.930
How can I inspire myself to be
a little bit more joyful, more

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:22.460
mindful, more emotional at work?

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.872
What are some practices
or ways that folks

00:11:24.872 --> 00:11:26.330
who are in a position
of leadership

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:28.790
can inspire themselves?

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:32.030
KRISTI HEDGES: Well, everything
that I wrote in the book

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:34.289
that inspires other
people also inspires you.

00:11:34.289 --> 00:11:36.080
And I'll be honest,
that didn't even hit me

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.163
until the end of the book.

00:11:37.163 --> 00:11:38.062
So I was writing it.

00:11:38.062 --> 00:11:39.020
And I'm, wait a minute.

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:41.700
We can use these
things on ourselves.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.700
And that's great, because
that--that's the idea.

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:44.730
It's a virtuous cycle.

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:47.410
So when we inspire other
people, we also get inspired.

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:50.260
And it-- and it all plays
into the same thing.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.280
But for example,
one of the top ways

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.920
that-- we were saying
that earlier-- that people

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.780
get inspired is
through conversation,

00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:58.670
through communication
with other people.

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:00.750
You can get inspired
reading your email,

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:02.660
but you probably won't.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:04.790
It's probably-- it's
sitting like this,

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:07.190
listening to other people
talk, thinking about things.

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:09.689
And I know you guys do a lot
of that Google-- bringing ideas

00:12:09.689 --> 00:12:12.170
in from the outside just to
expand your mind a little bit

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:14.300
and get you to
think differently.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:17.240
And so with leaders that
I've worked with often,

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.770
they'll get to a
place where they've

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:20.900
achieved a great
level of success,

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.690
but they just don't feel all
that inspired anymore about it.

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:26.450
And then I'll ask, well, who
do you talk to during the day?

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:28.040
And they talk to
the same people.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.610
They talk to their
management team.

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:31.610
They might go out and
talk to some customers.

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:35.250
Occasionally, they talk to the
board, whatever the case is.

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:38.000
But they don't actually have
any new inputs coming in.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.330
And so to really go out
and seek inspiration

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.190
to find people to
have conversations

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:45.914
with to-- if you don't have
any role models, to find some.

00:12:45.914 --> 00:12:48.080
Because they might not be
sitting around the office.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.940
You might have to
look outward for that.

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:52.520
And to put yourself in
places that just really

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:56.710
help you open your mind can be
a great pathway to inspiration.

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:57.955
JASON ANDREAS: Sure.

00:12:57.955 --> 00:13:00.080
You speak-- obviously,
you're here at Google today.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.490
You speak to a lot
of other companies.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:02.420
You speak at schools.

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:04.340
You speak at businesses.

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:07.460
Are there any really
interesting techniques

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:09.590
that you've absorbed
from speaking

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:11.000
at these different places--

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.640
folks that are doing,
I guess, either, A,

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.760
really great job of
inspiring their employees,

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.980
or their students, or
whatever it may be;

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:22.360
or on the flip side, B,
doing a really poor job

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:26.420
and doing it maybe in a forceful
way or an inauthentic way as we

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:28.010
discussed earlier.

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:30.960
KRISTI HEDGES: Well, I'll tell
you something that I see a lot.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.360
So I don't-- and I'm not
calling out anybody in this.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:36.800
If you see yourself in
this, then there you go.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.470
Is that companies spent
a lot of money and time

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:43.090
on corporate mission statements
and corporate visions.

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:45.590
And it's not that they don't
matter, because they do matter.

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:47.780
They just don't matter enough.

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:50.780
And they don't look at, what
are the conversations that

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:53.870
are happening every day in
organizations between managers

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:55.520
and their people and teams?

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.422
And what is the--

00:13:57.422 --> 00:13:58.880
I would say the
cultures are really

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.310
just stories built upon
stories in the organization.

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:03.140
There aren't enough
fresh stories

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:05.300
getting into the mix about
things that are working

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:06.620
and things that--

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.212
solutions that are
being overcome.

00:14:08.212 --> 00:14:10.670
And so they really hang their
hat on this beautiful mission

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:11.750
statement.

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:13.820
And yet, everybody
in the organization

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:16.160
doesn't buy it, because the
culture doesn't support it.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.140
So I see a lot of
that where we look

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:20.942
at the very high level, the-- so
the grand ideas of inspiration.

00:14:20.942 --> 00:14:23.150
And we've heard that you
have to have a great vision.

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:25.400
So we check that box,
and we spend a lot

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.840
of money checking that box.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.600
And then we just wait for
everybody's behavior to change.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.310
And it doesn't really
get embedded down

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:32.450
to the individual level.

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:34.490
I mean, what inspires us is
our day-to-day interactions

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:35.480
with people around us.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.270
JASON ANDREAS: Sure.

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:40.517
What are some common
mistakes people make?

00:14:40.517 --> 00:14:42.350
We've talked a lot about
the positive things

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:43.141
that people can do.

00:14:43.141 --> 00:14:45.660
We've talked about
inauthenticity

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:47.000
as maybe, I guess, a mistake.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.400
But are there other
things that you

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:53.510
see people making on a daily,
monthly, weekly basis--

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:57.730
mistakes that good leadership
folks that should know better

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:59.480
are actually making
mistakes that we

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.600
can understand and avoid
learning from past mistakes,

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.530
I suppose?

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:04.363
KRISTI HEDGES: Yeah.

00:15:04.363 --> 00:15:05.030
Yeah, sure.

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:07.160
Well, it's one we just
talked about at lunch.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.785
And I'll just bring
it up, because it's

00:15:08.785 --> 00:15:10.140
very, very current--

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:13.145
is that one of the most
inspiring conversations

00:15:13.145 --> 00:15:15.020
a leader can have
is to be in talks

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:18.280
with their people about their
teams, about their purpose.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.180
So helping them
really identify, how

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:23.041
is your purpose for
yourself being played out

00:15:23.041 --> 00:15:25.540
and being supported in the--
in the position that you're in?

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:27.500
And that seems like a
really grand conversation,

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:28.583
but it doesn't have to be.

00:15:28.583 --> 00:15:30.930
So just talking about
contextualized purpose--

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:33.380
so how does what
you're doing today

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:34.970
just help you take
a couple of steps

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:36.750
further along in
your development?

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:37.924
It can be that simple.

00:15:37.924 --> 00:15:40.340
But often, managers don't want
to be in that conversation,

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:42.820
because they're worried
that's going to have some--

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.680
their-- team member is
going to have an epiphany

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.507
and then go out
the door with that.

00:15:47.507 --> 00:15:49.090
And so they don't
want that to happen.

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:51.714
So like, well, I'm not going to
have that purpose conversation,

00:15:51.714 --> 00:15:52.800
because I might lose them.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.740
And that's a real
missed opportunity.

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:57.440
Because first of all, we
love when people engage us

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:58.760
in that larger question.

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.380
Because we're thinking
about it, or we

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:02.490
want to be thinking about it.

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:05.480
And if somebody creates a space
for us, it's very meaningful.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:08.480
And then also, often
there are things

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.210
that you don't see that
somebody around you

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:13.760
might see that can pull some
threads together and help you

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.176
understand that--
let's say you're

00:16:15.176 --> 00:16:18.400
working into a company
that's very chaotic.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.200
Well, that chaos might
be really teaching you

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.910
how to manage a
lot of complexity,

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:25.100
which you're going to need for
the next level of your career.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.110
So if somebody can help you
see that, all of a sudden,

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:28.964
that chaotic environment
isn't a grind just

00:16:28.964 --> 00:16:30.130
to manage through every day.

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:31.506
It's a huge learning
opportunity.

00:16:31.506 --> 00:16:32.921
And you may not
see that yourself.

00:16:32.921 --> 00:16:34.940
So being willing to be
in those conversations

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:36.982
is quite powerful, and we
don't have them enough.

00:16:36.982 --> 00:16:37.814
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah.

00:16:37.814 --> 00:16:39.260
Often times, people
want to build

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.562
on the base of what they have
without analyzing that base.

00:16:42.562 --> 00:16:44.270
So they're-- how can
I be more inspiring?

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:46.642
I'll do A, B, and C
without fixing what

00:16:46.642 --> 00:16:47.850
was wrong in the first place.

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:50.600
So we often look at how
you can improve upon what

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:51.890
you're currently doing.

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:54.237
And then, once you feel
like you've fixed that base,

00:16:54.237 --> 00:16:55.820
then you proceed
with some of the tips

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:58.320
from the book in terms of how
you can inspire and become

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.110
better yourself.

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:05.060
A lot of the book talks
in context of inspiring

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:07.640
in a corporate setting.

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:11.540
Are there ways that you can
take a lot of these topics

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:14.000
and themes and apply them
outside of the corporate world

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:14.889
as well?

00:17:14.889 --> 00:17:15.680
KRISTI HEDGES: Yes.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.802
I mean, everything
in the book works

00:17:17.802 --> 00:17:19.010
in any environment you're in.

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:22.190
So I have found myself
starting to use these

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:24.640
at home with my kids a lot
more as I've done the research.

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:25.869
JASON ANDREAS: That's
what I'm asking, yeah.

00:17:25.869 --> 00:17:26.400
KRISTI HEDGES: This might work.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.035
Let me think about that.

00:17:28.035 --> 00:17:28.660
And it's great.

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:29.590
They do.

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:31.840
And so it doesn't matter if
you're trying to-- there's

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.131
a lot of inspiration going
on in communities right now.

00:17:34.131 --> 00:17:36.740
There' a lot of inspiration
going on in Detroit right now.

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.650
And so using these
kinds of ideas

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:42.710
about what really gets people
inspired, what lights up--

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:46.000
lights people up-- it's
any group you can imagine.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.210
It's your teams at work.

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:48.610
It's your communities at home.

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:51.530
It's your schools that
you're working in.

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:52.370
It doesn't matter.

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:54.620
It's the same stuff, which
is the beauty of it, right?

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:57.110
I love when things apply
at work and apply at home.

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:59.882
And that's really what I tried
to do last time with "The Power

00:17:59.882 --> 00:18:00.590
of Presence" too.

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:02.631
It doesn't really matter
where you have presence.

00:18:02.631 --> 00:18:03.673
It's all the same result.

00:18:03.673 --> 00:18:05.547
JASON ANDREAS: We talked
a little bit-- right

00:18:05.547 --> 00:18:07.370
before we hopped on
stage here-- about how

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:08.780
inspiration can be contagious.

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:10.680
And we talked about
the city of Detroit,

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.540
which we're all
located in right now,

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:16.370
and how Detroit has
seen better days.

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:19.010
But what happened was there
was a few inspired individuals

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:23.870
who started to apply inspiration
to a certain-- their house,

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:27.530
to a neighborhood, a
street, whatever it may be.

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:28.790
And it spread very quickly.

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:31.380
We saw this inspiration
spread very quickly.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:33.395
And I feel like
that same concept--

00:18:33.395 --> 00:18:35.390
this took place in
a major US city.

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:38.280
That same concept can also
be applied to the workplace.

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:41.840
So if you're in an
uninspired workplace, having

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.790
a few individuals
that bring inspiration

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:46.837
that learn how to be
inspiring individuals,

00:18:46.837 --> 00:18:47.670
that could catch on.

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:49.500
And it could be
contagious as well, right?

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:51.530
KRISTI HEDGES: Absolutely And I
sit here with my Shinola watch

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:52.030
on.

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:53.390
So it's supporting Detroit.

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:53.750
JASON ANDREAS: Beautiful.

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:54.610
Beautiful.

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:55.680
KRISTI HEDGES: And
I-- we were saying,

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.670
I've been lurking,
watching Detroit for years

00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:00.260
and just rooting for
Detroit and just so inspired

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.340
by what's happening here.

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:06.900
So there is actually a
scientifically researched,

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:10.730
well-researched theory
called emotional contagion.

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:13.920
And so we always think about
it just in layman's terms

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.040
as, you catch
somebody's bad mood.

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.300
Don't bring people down.

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:20.040
Debbie Downer, we catch people's
bad or whatever the case is.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.710
But it is actually verifiable.

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:25.320
As humans, we do pick up
the moods of other people.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.310
And we develop as groups
what sociologists call group

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:30.090
affect, which is we kind of--

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:32.570
we kind of go towards the
center of whatever the mood is

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:34.760
in a particular organization.

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.370
Now, leaders actually
have more power

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:39.649
to shift that mood
than anybody else,

00:19:39.649 --> 00:19:41.690
because people may pay
more attention to leaders.

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:43.320
We pay attention
up the hierarchy.

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:47.000
So if a leader is cynical, the
group's going to feel cynical.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.510
If the leader is optimistic,
we're going to feel optimistic.

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:52.640
And so absolutely,
it is contagious.

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:55.310
But you need those people to
come in and be the brave ones

00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:57.230
to be the beachhead
for whatever emotion

00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:59.932
it is that you're trying
to get people to impart.

00:19:59.932 --> 00:20:01.640
And of course, there's
safety in numbers.

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:03.800
So if you get a few
people really excited,

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.350
then that tends to
change the dynamic

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:08.554
of a much larger organization.

00:20:08.554 --> 00:20:09.970
But it has to start
with somebody.

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:10.803
JASON ANDREAS: Sure.

00:20:10.803 --> 00:20:13.530
And we talked about in the
city of Detroit, Dan Gilbert--

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:17.340
not by far, not the only
person, but obviously,

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:20.370
one of the figureheads of some
positivity around Detroit.

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:23.040
And he instilled a lot
of inspiration in people

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.039
by investing a lot of
his money into the city.

00:20:25.039 --> 00:20:26.580
And again, a lot of
people, when they

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:29.640
saw that happen, a lot of
folks who were outside the city

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.680
or in the city who hadn't
necessarily invested,

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:34.020
now are investing
time and money to help

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:35.800
have inspire the city as well.

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:38.430
So Dan Gilbert's one that
comes to mind in Detroit.

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:42.450
Do you have any other leaders
that are inspiring to you--

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.310
folks that--

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:46.740
either in your home town,
or folks in your industry,

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:49.470
other authors that
have really embraced

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:52.770
this idea of inspiration and
presence and authenticity--

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:54.850
folks that have
really inspired you?

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:56.920
KRISTI HEDGES: Well, I'm
in Washington, DC, so--

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:57.630
[LAUGHING]

00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:59.015
JASON ANDREAS: Lots
of inspiration there.

00:20:59.015 --> 00:21:00.848
KRISTI HEDGES: There's
a lot of inspiration,

00:21:00.848 --> 00:21:03.090
all kinds of different ways.

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:03.590
Yes.

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:06.020
So, yes, I get inspired
by people all the time.

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:08.970
And I'll just tell you
personally for me right now,

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:11.940
I'm quite inspired by
people who are maybe

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:15.480
20 years further along in
their career than I am.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.520
Because I'm starting
to look and think, OK,

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.770
this next phase of my life--

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:23.130
how can I be most inspiring
in that and use my talents

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:25.320
and do the things
that I think are going

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.650
to be important beyond myself?

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:30.130
And I'm very inspired by people
who have been there before.

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:32.430
And role modeling is
just-- it's such a huge--

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:33.774
we talked about it earlier too.

00:21:33.774 --> 00:21:35.940
Role models are inspiring
to us, because they create

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:37.340
a vicarious experience for us.

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:39.360
When we see somebody,
like Dan Gilbert,

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:42.085
come in and do that, we're
inspired because we see

00:21:42.085 --> 00:21:43.710
him do something,
and we think, well, I

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:44.709
could maybe do that too.

00:21:44.709 --> 00:21:48.320
So maybe I can't buy
a whole building,

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:52.710
but maybe I could put a couple
of my people in that building.

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:53.947
So we make another step.

00:21:53.947 --> 00:21:55.530
And that's what role
models do for us.

00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:59.800
So I'm really looking
at people who are--

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:04.740
have a real need and
energy around being

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:07.300
in service and then how they're
doing that in their lives.

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:09.840
And so I am lucky enough
to have a couple of people

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:12.150
that I sought out, because
they didn't land in my lap.

00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:15.260
And I try to spend time with
them, and I see what they do.

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:18.060
And I always leave those
conversations just 10

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:20.185
feet tall, and we need that.

00:22:20.185 --> 00:22:21.060
We need those people.

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:22.290
JASON ANDREAS: Absolutely.

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:23.700
We're going to shifting
topics a little bit,

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:26.200
but still kind of tying into
what we were just talking about

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:27.930
is the idea of diversity.

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:31.722
So diversity-- not in the
sense of what people look like

00:22:31.722 --> 00:22:33.930
or where they're from, but
the diversity of cultures,

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:37.080
diversity of backgrounds,
diversity of professional

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:40.880
experience-- is incredibly
important and a huge topic--

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.350
incredibly important
for Google, a huge topic

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:45.130
in the media these days.

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:47.670
How do you tie this
idea of diversity

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:50.670
into authentic leadership
and inspiration and presence?

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:54.060
Is there a way to tie-in what
you were just mentioning,

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:55.680
bringing in diversity
from other folks

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:59.670
and really bringing that
all together in a way that

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:02.474
makes sense for a company, or a
family, or whatever it may be?

00:23:02.474 --> 00:23:03.640
KRISTI HEDGES: I don't know.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.181
But I'll try.

00:23:04.181 --> 00:23:06.090
[LAUGHING] Let me see if I can.

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:09.170
JASON ANDREAS: We're all
trying right now, of course.

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:10.590
KRISTI HEDGES:
Well, the research

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:13.600
supports that diverse
organizations perform better.

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.470
We know that at the board
level, throughout organizations.

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:18.630
I believe that the reason
that that's the case

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:20.430
is because of the
input idea that I just

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:22.130
talked about with inspiration.

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:25.170
When we see things from
people's experience,

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:27.400
it just expands our
own perspective.

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.440
So whatever cultural
blinders we have--

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.630
and you can define
culture however you want--

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:34.500
they get widened when we see
things that we previously

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:37.184
didn't see, because somebody
else has helped us see that.

00:23:37.184 --> 00:23:39.600
We've-- whether through role
modeling, or being with them,

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:42.100
or discussion, or
whatever the case is--

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:43.830
so we learn a lot more.

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:46.740
People become three-dimensional
when they're in front of us

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:50.700
and we know them and we can--
we understand that more.

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:53.250
We're a global world.

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:56.370
It's a trite phrase,
but it's true.

00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:57.390
We work with people--

00:23:57.390 --> 00:23:58.973
I work with people
all over the world.

00:23:58.973 --> 00:24:00.850
You guys probably do the same.

00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:03.330
And so diversity of
everything is important,

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:06.600
because it just allows us
to be in the world and--

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:07.747
with a broader perspective.

00:24:07.747 --> 00:24:08.580
JASON ANDREAS: Sure.

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:09.660
Perspectives are huge.

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:12.360
Getting perspectives from
different people and countries

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.100
and everything, cultures--

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:16.620
a huge difference maker.

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:19.140
What's one piece of
advice you would give us,

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:21.150
as Google-- speaking
to us as Google today

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:22.777
in terms of inspiration?

00:24:22.777 --> 00:24:24.360
Is there anything
you've heard or read

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.310
that we do good or bad
that could potentially

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:30.150
be turned into advice
that we could walk with--

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:32.100
walk away with today?

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:35.010
KRISTI HEDGES: Well, Google is
known for a lot of the things

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:36.200
that we just talked about.

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.586
So you guys are lucky,
because you're sitting

00:24:38.586 --> 00:24:39.710
in organizations like that.

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:44.150
And not all of the organizations
I work with can say the same.

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:46.229
What I admire from
Google from afar--

00:24:46.229 --> 00:24:47.520
so I don't work in the company.

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:51.120
But what I-- what
I see is just the--

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.064
you mentioned work
curiosity before.

00:24:53.064 --> 00:24:53.980
But that's what I see.

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:56.820
I see just a hunger
and a curiosity

00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:00.240
to learn and expand
and try new things.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:04.820
And when you have that
permeating the culture--

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:07.650
even today-- so we're
having a Google Talk.

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:08.850
We talked about earlier--

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:11.520
I said you're in a [INAUDIBLE]
Because you help put these

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.330
together, that
means that you get

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:17.490
to learn a lot about things that
you might be-- you care about.

00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:19.100
But all Google has
that opportunity.

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:24.470
So I think having that
kind of mindset and to be--

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:28.120
to be an outspoken leader in
things that from a business

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:31.450
standpoint in the corporate
community, which Google

00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:35.500
does frequently, is inspiring
to a lot of other organizations.

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:36.310
And you see that.

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:39.115
You see there are a select
number of companies--

00:25:39.115 --> 00:25:41.170
and Google's one of
them-- that can put out

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:43.360
a pretty bold statement.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:46.040
And you see other companies
lining up behind them.

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.180
And there's a
responsibility with that.

00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:51.370
But Google seems to
take it pretty well.

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:52.230
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah.

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:53.104
Well, we do our best.

00:25:53.104 --> 00:25:55.750
We do our best to be
inspirational as a company

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:59.020
and as individual contributors
here in the city of Detroit.

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:00.340
But it's hard.

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:05.020
It's a simple concept, but
putting it into practice, is--

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.500
it takes-- it does
take practice itself.

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:09.010
It takes practice
and understanding

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:11.389
and cognizance
more than anything.

00:26:11.389 --> 00:26:12.430
I wanted to open up now--

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:14.810
I'm sure we've got some
questions from the audience.

00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:16.735
We have a lot of leadership
here in the room.

00:26:16.735 --> 00:26:18.220
Wanted to open it
up for questions

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:21.150
if anyone has any questions
that we can ask Kristi.

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:22.650
I do have mics here
if you want to--

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:24.821
Corey, if you don't mind
running those for us.

00:26:24.821 --> 00:26:25.320
Thank you.

00:26:28.575 --> 00:26:30.640
AUDIENCE: I'll break
the ice for you, Jason.

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:32.290
Hi, Dave Hoffman.

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:35.800
And this is one of my
topics close to my heart.

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.170
I went back to get
my MBA specifically

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:41.400
based on corporate
cultures, things like that.

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.769
I am an ex-athlete,
and it's always funny

00:26:43.769 --> 00:26:45.310
how the best team
doesn't always win.

00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:47.934
It's normally the team that has
the most heart, the most-- best

00:26:47.934 --> 00:26:50.020
leadership, inspiration,
all those kind of things.

00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:52.000
One of the things
that I've found time

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.730
and time again is that natural--

00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:56.410
like that God-given
brilliance seems

00:26:56.410 --> 00:26:59.020
to really hinder your ability
to be an inspirational leader.

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:02.710
You get so caught up in how
things work or your mind

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:04.750
and whatever, that
you tend to not be

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:07.230
as personable or as outgoing.

00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:09.070
And that seems to be
the case sometimes here

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:11.110
at Google, where we
lack a little bit

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:12.880
of inspirational
leadership, because they

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:15.940
just that EQ isn't there.

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:19.780
So first, what are some of the
traits where you can actually

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:22.485
help coach someone up into that
from a leadership perspective?

00:27:22.485 --> 00:27:23.860
Or the other end
of the spectrum,

00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:25.568
where somebody might
be a little bit more

00:27:25.568 --> 00:27:28.269
fast and loose-- so a lot of
energy, but at the same time

00:27:28.269 --> 00:27:30.310
needs to find a way to
authentically dial it back

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:33.580
down so that they can fit
into that mold of a leader

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:37.457
without losing their uniqueness
or their genuineness.

00:27:37.457 --> 00:27:38.290
KRISTI HEDGES: Sure.

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:40.750
That's a couple of questions.

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:42.660
But I like where you're going.

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:44.980
And let me just say
that athletes often--

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:47.650
people who are former
athletes or athletes often

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:49.150
really get this,
because a lot of it

00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:51.280
is-- starts on the
inside, the mental game--

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:53.140
so really being
clear about that.

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:55.660
And if you have been an
athlete, a lot of times--

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:56.560
I wasn't an athlete.

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:57.482
I've heard this.

00:27:57.482 --> 00:27:58.940
That that's a part
of the training.

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:02.200
Or it's a positive visualization
plays a big role in it.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.900
So I'm not surprised to hear
the connection that you just

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:07.170
made between the
athleticism and then--

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:09.119
and culture.

00:28:09.119 --> 00:28:11.410
So the being in your head
problem's an interesting one.

00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:13.660
It's a blessing and a curse.

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:16.450
Because often if we're someone
who spends a lot of time

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:18.821
conceptualizing-- and maybe
that's our personality,

00:28:18.821 --> 00:28:21.070
or maybe we're an introvert
and that's how we process,

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:24.290
or whatever the case--

00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:27.870
it means that our first instinct
might not be to communicate.

00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:31.134
Our first instinct is to
step back and think about it.

00:28:31.134 --> 00:28:32.800
And when I work with
leaders like that--

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:35.470
which I do all the time, because
a lot of people are introverts

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:38.080
and that's where
they naturally go--

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:41.500
it's to get them out
of that predisposition

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:44.470
that things have to be perfect
before I communicate it.

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:46.161
And so I'm thinking
of someone that I

00:28:46.161 --> 00:28:47.410
worked with several years ago.

00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:50.270
And so one of my pieces
of advice to him was,

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:53.200
you need to-- you
need to go for--

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.510
intentional transparency
is what I called it.

00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:58.670
Because you think that
people are reading your mind.

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:01.010
But no one knows what's
going on up in here.

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:03.010
And so you need to be
very intentional about it.

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:05.980
So your first instinct when you
get a new piece of information

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:08.910
or when you have a plan
that's maybe 50% baked,

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:11.334
not 100% baked,
is to tell people.

00:29:11.334 --> 00:29:13.000
You need to get that
knee-jerk reaction.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.047
Because if it's just
you thinking about it,

00:29:15.047 --> 00:29:16.630
then it doesn't
really shape anything.

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:19.847
So that's one thing that
comes up quite a bit if that--

00:29:19.847 --> 00:29:20.680
if that makes sense.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:21.926
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:29:21.926 --> 00:29:22.912
KRISTI HEDGES: Yeah.

00:29:22.912 --> 00:29:23.405
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:29:23.405 --> 00:29:24.321
KRISTI HEDGES: Mm-hmm.

00:29:24.321 --> 00:29:25.784
JASON ANDREAS: Cool.

00:29:25.784 --> 00:29:26.450
Other questions?

00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:26.950
Ashley.

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:32.090
AUDIENCE: I'm gonna--

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:33.060
AUDIENCE: Hot mic.

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:33.340
AUDIENCE: Hot mic.

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:34.030
Here we go.

00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:34.540
How's this?

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:34.930
Better?

00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:35.555
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:29:35.555 --> 00:29:36.574
AUDIENCE: OK, great.

00:29:36.574 --> 00:29:37.990
So in addition to
being an author,

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:41.230
you consult and work
with large companies.

00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:44.830
And so I'm sitting here thinking
about all these principles

00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:48.820
and how we might push them down
through a company like Google

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:50.950
or through one of the
companies that we support

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:54.160
in this room, which are
large auto makers-- a GM,

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.320
a Ford, a Chrysler.

00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:01.330
So when you think about
tackling a huge corporate client

00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:04.660
like that-- let's say budget
was no option-- no issue,

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:06.680
and the CEO said,
I need your help

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.380
transforming my leadership.

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:11.320
What are-- what are some
of the levers or the tools

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:12.850
that you would use
with the company,

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:14.920
and what do you think
would be required to really

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:17.950
push this type of
inspirational development

00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:19.600
through a large organization?

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:23.320
Is it everything from personal
coaching for their leaders

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:24.790
in addition to retreats?

00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:28.810
And what are the levers that
you use to help actually

00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:30.370
push this through
in a meaningful way

00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:31.570
across a big organization?

00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:32.320
KRISTI HEDGES: OK.

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:33.700
Well, first of all,
no one ever says,

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:35.200
you can have all
the money you want.

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.830
[LAUGHING]

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:39.920
But my brain went
[SHOOTING NOISES]

00:30:40.769 --> 00:30:42.310
Well, so a couple
things-- obviously,

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:43.601
I'm a big believer in coaching.

00:30:43.601 --> 00:30:45.790
So I think there is
something really powerful.

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:47.650
And I became a coach
because I had a coach.

00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:49.820
And it just changed--
he changed my life.

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:53.411
And so I wanted to be able to
offer that to other people.

00:30:53.411 --> 00:30:55.660
And hopefully-- I don't know
if I changed their lives,

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:59.590
but I try really hard to be--
to be in service of them.

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:01.510
Is that personal
coaching changes things,

00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:03.910
because it's just such a
unique development opportunity.

00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:05.460
It's so personalized.

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:08.470
And it really allows
you to ask the questions

00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:12.640
that you want to ask in a very
safe setting with someone who

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:14.061
isn't invested in your outcome.

00:31:14.061 --> 00:31:15.560
They just want you
to be successful.

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.184
So nobody is trying
to game the system.

00:31:17.184 --> 00:31:19.270
So that's why I think
coaching is very effective.

00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:21.740
But beyond that, if I could
work in an organization

00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:24.490
however I wanted to, what
I think is most effective

00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:28.600
is when you introduce
concepts to a swath of people.

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:32.050
So maybe it's all
leaders in a office

00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:33.880
or whatever the case is--

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:36.357
so everybody gets the same
songbook, if you will.

00:31:36.357 --> 00:31:38.440
So everybody starts to
think about things a little

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:39.680
differently.

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:43.480
And then you have some breakout
cohort groups underneath

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:44.470
of that.

00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:47.230
Because I think-- back
to the role modeling

00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:48.340
and the conversation--

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:49.840
I that's what
really starts to get

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:52.450
people to think, OK, how can
I really embed this in my day

00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:53.574
to day?

00:31:53.574 --> 00:31:55.240
And you get economies
of scale that way,

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:56.710
because the conversation
gets richer.

00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:58.210
And everybody gets
curious, and they

00:31:58.210 --> 00:31:59.570
start looking at other things.

00:31:59.570 --> 00:32:01.819
So I think it's a combination
of those that can really

00:32:01.819 --> 00:32:03.400
help shift the culture.

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.019
But let me just
say that anything

00:32:05.019 --> 00:32:07.060
that I wrote about in this
book or the last book,

00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:08.143
I always tell people this.

00:32:08.143 --> 00:32:10.535
It's not hard stuff.

00:32:10.535 --> 00:32:12.910
It's not like you read, and
you're like, wow, listening--

00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:15.100
I never thought about
listening before.

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:16.090
You know it.

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:18.260
We just don't do it.

00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:20.710
And so part of my
work, what I try to do,

00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:22.960
is really to close
that knowing-doing gap.

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:25.600
So you know it, but then
how do you make it easier

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.326
to actually just do it?

00:32:27.326 --> 00:32:29.450
And so I try to make it
very accessible for people.

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:30.730
And so when I come in
and work with teams,

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:31.870
that's really what it's about.

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:33.370
I'm not there to
tell you something

00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:34.453
you've never heard before.

00:32:34.453 --> 00:32:36.100
I'm there to get
you to do things

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:37.690
you probably know
you already should

00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:40.090
be doing but you don't do.

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:42.100
And that's really what it is.

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:44.350
JASON ANDREAS: Sometimes
it's good to have a reminder.

00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:47.360
For folks in this room
and folks across Google,

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:48.420
you talk about it.

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:50.620
These concepts
are not difficult.

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:51.640
They're simple concepts.

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:52.660
It's not rocket science.

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:57.580
But a lot of times to some
folks in a company like this,

00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:01.149
coding search algorithms
is very simple.

00:33:01.149 --> 00:33:03.190
Listening, actually, is
not that simple for them.

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:05.023
It's something that
they do have to practice

00:33:05.023 --> 00:33:08.570
and something that seems
like a very simple concept

00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:10.810
but outside of what
they're used to is--

00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:14.500
it takes a little bit of
extra focus and elbow grease

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:16.290
to make sure that
it happens right.

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:18.700
[INAUDIBLE] the last question
I had because you mentioned

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:19.430
is here.

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:21.910
And the answer to Ashley's
question was around coaching.

00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:24.602
And you mentioned that you had
a coach yourself that drove you

00:33:24.602 --> 00:33:25.560
in the right direction.

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:27.460
Can you talk about that
process a little bit?

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:29.950
Because we all-- we
talk about inspiration.

00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:31.534
We're talking about presence.

00:33:31.534 --> 00:33:32.950
I think one thing
that we all look

00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:36.880
for here is finding coaches
that can help us along our paths

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:39.129
as well to become better
inspirational leaders,

00:33:39.129 --> 00:33:41.170
to become better employees,
and things like that.

00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:45.187
Can you talk about that
coaching and coachee atmosphere

00:33:45.187 --> 00:33:47.770
that you just mentioned and talk
a little bit about your coach

00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:50.057
and how that person
has inspired you?

00:33:50.057 --> 00:33:50.890
KRISTI HEDGES: Sure.

00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:54.280
Well, I-- I've been an
entrepreneur since I was 27.

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:59.410
So I didn't have an organization
full of people to role model

00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:00.910
and mentor me.

00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:02.860
And very early on,
I got introduced

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:06.640
to someone who was a leadership
coach for small business

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:09.400
owners, and it
was just immensely

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:11.050
helpful in so many ways.

00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:13.909
But probably the most
is that it was somebody

00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:15.330
I could be very frank with.

00:34:15.330 --> 00:34:19.487
And he had a business
for 20 or 30 years.

00:34:19.487 --> 00:34:21.070
And so there wasn't
anything I came up

00:34:21.070 --> 00:34:23.900
with that he hadn't already
been through it five times.

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:25.840
So it was really
nice just to have

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:28.550
a little bit of normalizing
of things that were happening

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:32.409
but also somebody that could
really just push my thinking

00:34:32.409 --> 00:34:38.170
and have just no BS allowed in
the discussion, who would just

00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:40.975
call you on stuff
and really make

00:34:40.975 --> 00:34:42.850
you accountable but in
a very supportive way.

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:44.860
And that's just a
very unusual dynamic

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:46.659
to have somebody
who will push you,

00:34:46.659 --> 00:34:48.701
support you at the same
time, has experience

00:34:48.701 --> 00:34:51.159
they can bring that help you
understand contextually what's

00:34:51.159 --> 00:34:55.762
going on, and then doesn't
have any gain in your outcome.

00:34:55.762 --> 00:34:57.970
So they're not going to fire
you if you don't do it--

00:34:57.970 --> 00:34:59.095
what you just talked about.

00:34:59.095 --> 00:34:59.890
It's really you.

00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:01.306
It's your development
opportunity.

00:35:01.306 --> 00:35:03.100
You do what you
want to do with it.

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:06.700
And I find with my
clients now as a coach,

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:08.370
my job is to be supportive.

00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:10.690
And my job is to be
incredibly honest.

00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:13.420
So I don't hold back
with my clients.

00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:15.690
I think they need to hear
what my observations are.

00:35:15.690 --> 00:35:18.400
That's what I'm there for.

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:21.260
And I try to really adjust
to their learning styles

00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:24.200
so they can hear
in the best way.

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:27.310
But my investment is in
their success, and that's it.

00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:29.600
And I think the best
coaches look at it that way.

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:30.683
JASON ANDREAS: Absolutely.

00:35:30.683 --> 00:35:31.550
Great.

00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:32.050
Awesome.

00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:33.920
Well, Kristi, thank you so
much for coming in today.

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:34.628
We appreciate it.

00:35:34.628 --> 00:35:37.404
This was very inspiring
for us, appropriately.

00:35:37.404 --> 00:35:39.070
Again, the book, "The
Inspiration Code,"

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:41.530
if you guys haven't, grab
a copy on the way out.

00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:42.680
I think it's not out yet.

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:43.430
KRISTI HEDGES: No.

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:44.320
It comes out on Thursday.

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.280
JASON ANDREAS: It
comes our on Thursday.

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:46.591
So we have advance copies.

00:35:46.591 --> 00:35:47.340
How great is that?

00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:48.914
So if you haven't, grab a book.

00:35:48.914 --> 00:35:50.830
You can read it before
the general public even

00:35:50.830 --> 00:35:52.080
gets to put their hands on it.

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:54.010
So once again, thank
you, Kristi, for coming.

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:54.770
We appreciate it.

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:55.540
Thanks for joining us.

00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:55.780
KRISTI HEDGES: Thanks, guys.

00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:56.330
Thanks for having me.
