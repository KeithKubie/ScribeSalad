00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:11.220
This September global business and political leaders meet in Dalian in northeast China to ponder how to revive economic growth.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.210
While government stimulus programmes are critical in the near term, 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:21.120
entrepreneurship, innovation and technology will drive a transformational recovery for the long term.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:28.100
This recovery will be directed by a new generation of leaders – the New Champions – 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:35.120
and the World Economic Forum is bringing them together at this “Summer Davos”. 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.210
But the key question is 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:43.080
“Will China pull us out of the economic crisis? 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:50.090
Can China be a significant driver in bringing the world economy out of its present recession?

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.090
What do you think?

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.010
Simply vote in our poll!

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.240
And upload your thoughts on video.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.020
Your videos will be shown at the Annual Meeting of the New Champions in Dalian. 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:12.150
We will encourage the leaders gathered to reply to your videos from Dalian.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.160
Thank You!
