00:00:00.622 --> 00:00:02.392
- [Instructor] So we are asked to order

00:00:02.392 --> 00:00:04.839
the expressions from least to greatest

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:07.367
and this is from the
exercises on Khan Academy

00:00:07.367 --> 00:00:09.152
and if we're doing it on Kahn Academy,

00:00:09.152 --> 00:00:11.219
we would drag these little tiles around

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.999
from least to greatest, least on the left,

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:15.066
greatest on the right.

00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:16.432
I can't drag it around 'cause this

00:00:16.432 --> 00:00:18.142
is just a picture, so
I'm gonna evaluate each

00:00:18.142 --> 00:00:20.091
of these, and then I'm gonna rewrite them

00:00:20.091 --> 00:00:21.912
from least to greatest.

00:00:21.912 --> 00:00:23.793
So let's start with two to the third minus

00:00:23.793 --> 00:00:25.104
two to the first.

00:00:25.104 --> 00:00:26.082
What is that going to be?

00:00:26.082 --> 00:00:27.456
Two to the third minus two to the first.

00:00:27.456 --> 00:00:28.990
And if you feel really confident,

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.073
just pause this video and try

00:00:30.073 --> 00:00:31.304
to figure out the whole thing.

00:00:31.304 --> 00:00:33.467
Order them from least to greatest.

00:00:33.467 --> 00:00:37.817
Well two to the third, that
is two times two times two,

00:00:37.817 --> 00:00:40.373
and then two to the first,
well that's just two.

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:43.649
So two times two is
four, times two is eight,

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.059
minus two, this is going
to be equal to six.

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.858
So this expression right over here could

00:00:49.858 --> 00:00:52.970
be evaluated as being equal to six.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.104
Now, what about this right over here?

00:00:55.104 --> 00:00:57.508
What is this equal to?

00:00:57.508 --> 00:01:00.425
Well let's see, we have two squared

00:01:01.285 --> 00:01:03.238
plus three to the zero.

00:01:03.238 --> 00:01:07.029
Two squared is two times two and anything

00:01:07.029 --> 00:01:10.862
to the zero power is
going to be equal to one.

00:01:12.076 --> 00:01:13.114
It's an interesting thing to think

00:01:13.114 --> 00:01:15.039
about what zero to the zeroth power should

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:17.278
be but that'll be a
topic for another video.

00:01:17.278 --> 00:01:19.068
But here we have three
to the zeroth power,

00:01:19.068 --> 00:01:21.972
which is clearly equal to one.

00:01:21.972 --> 00:01:23.767
And so we have two times two plus one.

00:01:23.767 --> 00:01:27.496
This is four plus one,
which is equal to five.

00:01:27.496 --> 00:01:30.189
So the second tile is equal to five.

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:33.464
And then three squared,
well three squared,

00:01:33.464 --> 00:01:35.146
that's just three times three.

00:01:35.146 --> 00:01:38.063
Three times three is equal to nine.

00:01:38.994 --> 00:01:40.653
So if I were to order them from least

00:01:40.653 --> 00:01:42.767
to greatest, the smallest of these

00:01:42.767 --> 00:01:46.600
is two squared plus three
to the zeroth power.

00:01:47.465 --> 00:01:50.226
That one is equal to five,
so I'd put that on the left.

00:01:50.226 --> 00:01:52.276
Then we have this thing that's equal

00:01:52.276 --> 00:01:56.870
to six, two to the third power
minus two to the first power.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.629
And then the largest value
here is three squared.

00:02:00.629 --> 00:02:04.455
So we would put that tile, three squared.

00:02:04.455 --> 00:02:07.892
We will put that tile on
the right, and we're done.
