00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.010
- Hey everyone I hope your
having an amazing day.

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.430
It's Mark Wiens, I'm
in Chiang Mai, Thailand

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:06.890
and Chiang Mai is maybe the capital

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.750
of night markets in the entire world.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.200
And so it is a Sunday night.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.477
I am at (foreign language).

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.270
This is one of the biggest and

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.210
the busiest night markets in Chiang Mai.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.220
It runs the entire length
of Ratchadamnoen Road.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.470
Which is right in the center,

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.700
the heart of of Chiang Mai.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.090
So this evening we're
gonna go on a food tour

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.420
of the night market in Chiang Mai.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.780
We're just gonna see what we find,

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.070
we're gonna eat some delicious food and

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.903
I'm gonna share it all

00:00:31.903 --> 00:00:32.883
with you in this video right now.

00:00:32.883 --> 00:00:35.466
(upbeat music)

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.190
This particular market
is open every Sunday.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.050
And it starts at 5:00 p.m..

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.220
Right now it's exactly 5:00
p.m. so they're just open up.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.160
Most of the vendors are here,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.600
but still sorta organizing,

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.860
setting things up.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.360
There's a mix of almost
everything at this market.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.010
From souvenirs and clothes,

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.570
trinkets and lanterns and lights.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.770
But mainly I'm here to
just sample the food

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.510
and we're gonna see what we can find.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.460
And try to eat some of the...

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.293
Mix of things.

00:01:07.293 --> 00:01:08.710
And I'm still waiting for my friends

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.814
Tom and Joel who are gonna
come also hang out tonight.

00:01:12.814 --> 00:01:14.650
But we got here a little
bit before they did.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.270
I wanted to get here right as they opened,

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.740
the market opens, so I
could get all the shots.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.740
But they should be joining me soon.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.573
(foreign chatter)

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.370
Anytime I see a cart that's
loaded with this much meat,

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.240
in this particular instance, sausage,

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.350
there's no way you can walk past it

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.840
without ordering a few skewers,

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.750
and it is just smoking away.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:42.760
You can see her,

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.170
the fan is blowing, the
sausage under there.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.980
The fat is just burning down,

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.520
it's just smoking away it smells so good.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.780
Most of what's hanging on the bar is

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.270
sai krok Isan, which is a...

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.970
It's an Isan style sausage.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.460
But then she also has some
of the northern sausage.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.260
Which is called sai ua.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.250
In two different shapes
and so I got one of the,

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.040
one skewer of the Isan sausage as well as

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.017
the northern Thai sausage
we'll just taste them both

00:02:09.017 --> 00:02:10.390
to taste the difference.

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:11.925
Okay this is the sai krok Isan.

00:02:11.925 --> 00:02:14.758
(foreign chatter)

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.680
Oh wow!

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.123
Okay, that is a big bite.

00:02:22.123 --> 00:02:24.850
It's so good though, just
bursting with fatty juices.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.420
And for sai krok Isan you have to chase it

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.560
with a chili because
that's just pure meat.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.730
As opposed to what we'll
see in the next bite

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.330
of the sai ua, so I got a chili.

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:35.520
Oh yeah.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.520
That completes the
experience, it's so good.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.010
It's so juicy.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.060
Wow that's tasty.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.070
And then as opposed to the sai krok Isan,

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.070
which is, there's no spices
within the sausage itself

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.200
but you eat spices, you chase
with spices, like the chili.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.460
This one is the sai ua which
is filled with spices already

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.070
within the ground meat mixture.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.255
So there's lemon grass in
here, there should be chilies.

00:02:57.255 --> 00:02:58.260
These are a little--

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.440
Mmm.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.797
Oh yeah.

00:03:01.797 --> 00:03:03.369
Hohoho.

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:05.049
Sai ua is so good.

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:05.930
You can taste the lemon grass.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.770
This one is quite a fatty mix.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:08.824
But it is juicy.

00:03:08.824 --> 00:03:10.160
(upbeat music)

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.993
Wow.

00:03:10.993 --> 00:03:12.740
There's no better way I could think of,

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.320
to start this night market food tour,

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.737
in Chiang Mai.

00:03:16.737 --> 00:03:17.570
Mmm.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:18.770
(foreign chatter)

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.600
Now that market is still pretty quiet.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.290
Well, very quiet compared
to what it's gonna be.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.053
Right now you still have
lots of space to move around.

00:03:25.053 --> 00:03:27.120
The vendors are still setting up,

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.610
but I can guarantee in a couple of hours,

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.500
especially when the sun is fully down,

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.070
the market will be packed.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.113
So it is good to come early.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.628
If you are weary of
just single file crowds.

00:03:40.628 --> 00:03:43.211
(upbeat music)

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.810
We ended up walking all the way across

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.040
to the other side of the market.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.130
Actually we started on
the end of the market,

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.220
but this is actually the front.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.237
At (foreign language).

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.470
So this is the front gate here.

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.350
So this is where you normally
come into the market.

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:04.990
And it's just now almost 6 p.m. and

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:06.694
it's just starting to get really busy.

00:04:06.694 --> 00:04:09.277
(upbeat music)

00:04:15.734 --> 00:04:16.567
(foreign language)

00:04:16.567 --> 00:04:17.740
The hard thing about this market

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.720
is it's so huge and so sprawling and

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.710
it goes down so many little side alleys

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:23.710
and into little temple courtyards.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.410
And so, within lots of
little temple courtyards,

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.990
there are little food courts.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.660
Just an everlasting supply of Thai snacks.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.475
And so we saw the giant
pan of bubbling, buoyant,

00:04:36.475 --> 00:04:40.020
pork balls, in Thai they're
called look chin mu.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.150
And she informed us
that they are 100% pork.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.410
So it's just pork that's been...

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.950
Very ground, very smoothly
and made into little balls.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.200
They boil.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.330
You can just see them
all just like buoyantly

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.240
floating around in the wok, in the water.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.010
Then she scoops them out,
she serves them to you

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.040
fresh over some lettuce.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.860
She puts on a little bit of toasted garlic

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.280
and some of the sauce,

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.740
which I think should
be a little bit sweet.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.690
That looks really good, we
gotta try a hot fresh pork ball.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:08.693
Mmm.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:10.563
Mm.

00:05:10.563 --> 00:05:12.440
It's so soft and tender.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.083
Yet, not mushy.

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.380
Very kinda neutral tasting and just...

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.640
I got a piece of Chinese
celery on that bite.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.530
And also the sauce,
which is a little bit...

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:22.950
Sour,

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.560
a tinge sweet,

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.250
and a tinge spicy.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.424
Mm, but you can taste the
quality, the freshness of them.

00:05:28.424 --> 00:05:31.190
You can tell that's just
pure pork, that's luscious.

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.140
It's very mild in flavor but you can taste

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.810
just a hint of black pepper.

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.205
Maybe even white pepper.

00:05:36.205 --> 00:05:38.501
(drumming)

00:05:38.501 --> 00:05:41.168
(foreign music)

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.110
Oh there they are.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.920
(foreign language)

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:53.850
What's up Tom?

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:54.849
- What's up?

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:55.683
- [Mark] What's up, JJ?

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:58.786
- That's so good.

00:05:58.786 --> 00:05:59.619
You know what?

00:05:59.619 --> 00:06:00.452
Have a try.

00:06:00.452 --> 00:06:01.479
- Warm and sour.

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:02.430
- The last one.
- Warm and sour?

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.018
- Sour and spicy.

00:06:04.018 --> 00:06:04.950
(foreign language)

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.826
- [Mark] Already had some
look chin and some sai krok.

00:06:08.826 --> 00:06:10.300
- Nice.
- Whoa.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.450
- [Mark] Okay I'll taste it.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:12.283
Thank you.

00:06:13.204 --> 00:06:14.610
I would love some sai ua.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.273
- It's like a Vietnamese sausage.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.190
- They really take care a
lot about people around them.

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:22.040
- Oh that's nice.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.137
- I'm just joking.
- You think so?

00:06:24.137 --> 00:06:24.970
Okay.

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:26.514
- That is a ramble.

00:06:26.514 --> 00:06:27.960
- Isn't it kinda like that German um--

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.227
- Yeah it's like Leberkäse.

00:06:29.227 --> 00:06:31.610
- Leberkäse, yes that's what it is.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:32.980
- It's like,

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.860
the Thai version of German Leberkäse.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.190
- Yup.

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:37.180
- But spicy.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.330
- And it has a little bit of a pepper,

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:39.163
black pepper dish.

00:06:39.163 --> 00:06:40.510
- Yeah, sour,
- But like so--

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:42.340
- vinegar, spicy...

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.700
- It's kinda just like the
pork ball that I just ate.

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.538
Just in flat, square form.

00:06:49.538 --> 00:06:51.335
(upbeat music)

00:06:51.335 --> 00:06:54.168
(foreign chatter)

00:06:58.785 --> 00:07:00.150
Something that you have
to eat especially at this

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:01.883
market is called kai pam.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:04.253
It's a grilled egg.

00:07:04.253 --> 00:07:05.086
It's like an omelet.

00:07:05.086 --> 00:07:07.750
It's like a trough of
egg that they fill up

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.450
into a banana leaf, little trough boat.

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:11.600
And then they grill it.

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:13.880
They have a few different toppings.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:14.780
One of them is mushrooms.

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.880
One of them is, I'm not even sure.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.960
A bunch of different imitation crab.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.190
But then it slow grills as she
kinda stirs it with a stick.

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:26.130
And so that's kinda like
a new form of an omelet.

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:28.313
That you should eat at this
market, we're gonna sample it.

00:07:28.313 --> 00:07:30.263
It's kinda stuck stuck into the trough.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:33.873
Mmm!

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:36.510
Oh it's like a juicy omelet.

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:37.880
It's very juicy.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:38.713
But...

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.500
I mean, apart from a different,

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.490
any other omelet, it does
actually have the flavor of the,

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:46.900
the banana leaf, the bai tong.

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:47.733
- Oh, totally!

00:07:47.733 --> 00:07:50.030
- The roasted banana leaf
just embeds into the omelet.

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:52.430
Other than that it's just
like a juicier omelet.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:54.503
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.580
It's actually pretty good.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:57.770
How's that egg, Tom?

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:58.610
- [Tom] Pretty good, pretty good.

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:00.318
I got the one with the, with the bee.

00:08:00.318 --> 00:08:02.330
- [Mark] Oh, the bee hive?

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:03.990
- Yeah.
- The bee uh...

00:08:05.191 --> 00:08:06.024
- Larv?

00:08:06.024 --> 00:08:06.857
- [Mark] Larvae?

00:08:06.857 --> 00:08:07.690
- Yeah.

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:08.980
It's pretty good actually.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:10.460
It doesn't taste like bee though.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.820
No honey taste, but,

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:12.653
very eggy.

00:08:12.653 --> 00:08:14.550
- [Mark] This is another
version with a different topping

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:16.111
that we got which is bee larvae.

00:08:16.111 --> 00:08:18.801
(upbeat music)

00:08:18.801 --> 00:08:19.675
Mm.

00:08:19.675 --> 00:08:21.089
Oh yeah.

00:08:21.089 --> 00:08:23.120
The larva's very creamy.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:23.953
Mm-mm.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.730
The egg was interesting and pretty good.

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:29.680
We're moving on, and now the
market is just getting packed.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.234
But we're on our way to eat more food.

00:08:32.234 --> 00:08:34.890
(upbeat music)

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:36.870
Joel just got a passion fruit shake.

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:39.187
This is just pure passion
fruit blended with ice.

00:08:39.187 --> 00:08:42.488
(upbeat music)

00:08:42.488 --> 00:08:43.720
Oh.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.020
Oh that's just like, perfectly tart.

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:47.360
Nice and sour.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.680
Just a tinge of sweetness and

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.170
you've got the crunch of those seeds.

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:51.080
Thanks, man.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.120
- Sour.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.400
- [Mark] Yeah, that's the...

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.590
That's just pure and good.

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:57.058
- Yeah, look all those seeds.

00:08:57.058 --> 00:08:59.641
(upbeat music)

00:09:03.092 --> 00:09:04.453
- It's so packed, yeah.

00:09:04.453 --> 00:09:05.590
Especially at this time,

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:07.054
it's just like single file.

00:09:07.054 --> 00:09:07.927
- Yeah.

00:09:07.927 --> 00:09:10.488
- We're just in a line,
going through the market.

00:09:10.488 --> 00:09:13.129
(foreign chatter)

00:09:13.129 --> 00:09:15.521
- Very traditional.

00:09:15.521 --> 00:09:18.354
(foreign chatter)

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:25.720
- Kind of, stuck together.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.553
Help me, help me.

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:32.624
Oh!

00:09:32.624 --> 00:09:34.874
(laughing)

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:37.840
- Get some air intake, some air intake.

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:40.870
- Yeah, so it must be thick then.

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:43.540
If it's hot to eat like that.

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:45.600
- [Mark] And it is black sticky rice,

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.490
or purple sticky rice,

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:48.010
which is made into a little pancake

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:50.610
and then she sizzles it
over the hot griddle.

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:52.280
She adds on a variety of toppings

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:55.120
including sesame and sugar...

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.176
It looks almost exactly the
same as a piece of beef jerky.

00:09:58.176 --> 00:10:01.467
(background chatter)

00:10:01.467 --> 00:10:02.349
Mm.

00:10:02.349 --> 00:10:03.780
Mm-mm-mm.

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:05.480
Oh that's delicious.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.500
It's really chewy and glutinous.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:08.739
But at the same time it's crispy,

00:10:08.739 --> 00:10:10.443
because how it's been fried.

00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:11.380
It's sweet.

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:12.806
You taste the sesame seed.

00:10:12.806 --> 00:10:14.279
Mm.

00:10:14.279 --> 00:10:16.301
Yeah, that's fantastic
actually, it's really good.

00:10:16.301 --> 00:10:18.300
(foreign chatter)

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.670
So we're off to just
explore more and to...

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:21.748
To get some more food.

00:10:21.748 --> 00:10:23.998
(drumming)

00:10:25.697 --> 00:10:28.560
(foreign music)

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.830
Anything smelling the...

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:30.700
The barbecue over there.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.120
- Oh nice.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.035
I'm sure there's some hot--

00:10:34.035 --> 00:10:36.868
(foreign chatter)

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:44.588
- This will be perfect.

00:10:44.588 --> 00:10:45.990
(sizzling)

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:48.657
(foreign music)

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.490
- [Mark] At the back of
temple, food court area,

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:56.090
there is a man who is making ribs

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:57.840
and they smell so good.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.309
Oh he's chopping them right now.

00:10:59.309 --> 00:11:02.142
(foreign chatter)

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:10.617
- Mark Wien.

00:11:10.617 --> 00:11:13.450
(foreign chatter)

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.010
- [Mark] They have a few
seats, they have a few tables

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:20.420
in the back with a few stalls
that you can order from.

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:22.030
I gotta try those ribs first and

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:24.825
dip that rib into the dry chili flakes.

00:11:24.825 --> 00:11:27.658
(foreign chatter)

00:11:30.398 --> 00:11:31.650
Mm.

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:34.720
Those are pretty fatty, oily delicious.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.570
You can taste the dark soy sauce.

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:39.060
Which it kinda caramelized onto there

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:41.980
so it kinda roasted and caramelized.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:42.840
Oh and that chili though,

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:46.560
that's kinda like a
salty, dried chili powder.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:47.420
Yeah that's great.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:51.090
- Upon tasting one, he
immediately ordered seconds.

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:51.983
- [Mark] Oh Tom did?

00:11:51.983 --> 00:11:52.879
- Yes.

00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:55.712
(foreign chatter)

00:12:05.562 --> 00:12:06.842
- Mm.

00:12:06.842 --> 00:12:09.675
(foreign chatter)

00:12:12.681 --> 00:12:14.580
- The greasy barbecue goodness, man.

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:15.550
- Mm.

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:16.680
- What is it called, ong pu?

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:17.647
- Ong pu?

00:12:17.647 --> 00:12:18.715
- Ong pu.

00:12:18.715 --> 00:12:21.548
(foreign chatter)

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.000
- [Mark] It looks a lot like sangkaya,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.250
but these are little crab
heads as you can see.

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:30.230
Oh they're nice and hot.

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:32.070
Right off the grill or something.

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:34.630
But it's the crab eggs made into like a...

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:37.460
It looks kinda like custardy.

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.163
So you grab some sticky rice.

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:43.663
And then you, you just
kinda dip it like a dip.

00:12:45.433 --> 00:12:46.266
Oh.

00:12:46.266 --> 00:12:47.410
Looking soft there.

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:49.720
Looks like oony too, like sea urchin.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.258
So butter.

00:12:51.258 --> 00:12:52.770
(background chatter)

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:53.720
Mmm.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:54.810
Mm, yeah.

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:56.980
That's like, that for sure,

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:58.977
is like crab egg custard.

00:12:58.977 --> 00:13:00.150
Mm.

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:02.170
You've got the crabby taste.

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:04.620
You've got the smoky taste
because it's been grilled.

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:06.000
And then it's kinda like,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:06.870
creamy and rich.

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:08.150
Mm.

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:09.443
- Yeah look at that gooey-ness.

00:13:09.443 --> 00:13:13.048
(background chatter)

00:13:13.048 --> 00:13:13.881
Mm.

00:13:17.543 --> 00:13:18.376
Mmm.

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:21.100
That is rich.

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:21.973
Delicious.

00:13:22.858 --> 00:13:24.343
Mm.

00:13:24.343 --> 00:13:25.176
Yeah and it's still warm.

00:13:25.176 --> 00:13:26.342
- [Mark] Time for another rib.

00:13:26.342 --> 00:13:27.590
(upbeat music)

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:28.440
- Gotta get that.

00:13:29.523 --> 00:13:30.519
- [Mark] Let's do the...

00:13:30.519 --> 00:13:31.352
- That oomala.

00:13:31.352 --> 00:13:32.300
- [Mark] Let's wipe up.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:34.163
Wipe that up.

00:13:35.924 --> 00:13:39.560
We really like the chili dry rub.

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.603
Really adds to it.

00:13:42.514 --> 00:13:43.750
(background chatter)

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:45.100
Cheers.

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.078
- I need to get more chili!

00:13:47.078 --> 00:13:49.650
- [Mark] I got a full crust.

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:50.710
Oh that's beautiful.

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:51.620
That's what you want.

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:52.453
- Okay that's better.

00:13:52.453 --> 00:13:54.030
- They add sugar to them.
- Cheers.

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:55.820
It's either sugar or MSG or both.

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:57.093
- Yeah maybe it is sugar.

00:13:58.220 --> 00:13:59.220
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:03.130
- One biter.

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:04.359
- One bite?

00:14:04.359 --> 00:14:07.442
(background chatter)

00:14:08.728 --> 00:14:11.340
- The only reason you can't go one biter

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.430
is cause you gotta keep on twirling it.

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:16.166
Get all the way in and
then you got the bone.

00:14:16.166 --> 00:14:18.749
(upbeat music)

00:14:22.423 --> 00:14:25.143
That is like, very tasty.

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:28.540
Very fatty juicy greasy.

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.194
- I think there's a little sugar
in the chili powder though.

00:14:30.194 --> 00:14:32.035
- Yeah, it has a sweet tinge to it.

00:14:32.035 --> 00:14:35.457
(upbeat music, background chatter)

00:14:35.457 --> 00:14:37.774
(foreign chatter)

00:14:37.774 --> 00:14:40.651
(drumming)

00:14:40.651 --> 00:14:43.318
(foreign music)

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:47.993
- 200.

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:51.300
- 230 for one chunk I guess we may just--

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:52.930
- She gives us discount.

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:55.522
I think this is the best piece.

00:14:55.522 --> 00:14:58.605
(background chatter)

00:14:59.945 --> 00:15:02.333
- [Mark] Two little loaves here.

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:04.710
So we finished with that meal but

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:06.630
the market is just packed and it's hectic

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:09.410
and you're just running back
and forth from place to place

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:13.110
so we're gonna call it a
night of this food tour,

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:15.490
market, night market in Chiang Mai.

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:17.940
But before we end the tour though,

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:20.410
there was something that we had to eat.

00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:22.810
Of course, as the best
dessert in the world.

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:25.210
It's a little overpriced
because of the night market,

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:27.690
but that's okay, we need some.

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:28.873
- Got a little...

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.090
Gooey goodness here.

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:31.923
- [Mark] Alright guys.

00:15:31.923 --> 00:15:33.396
Let's break bread together.

00:15:33.396 --> 00:15:34.229
(laughing)

00:15:34.229 --> 00:15:35.062
- Oh yes!

00:15:35.062 --> 00:15:36.790
Already creaming on the...

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:37.623
(laughs)

00:15:37.623 --> 00:15:38.993
On the Saran wrap here.

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:40.860
Okay.

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:43.210
- Well we got a little
residue on the Saran.

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:44.270
(laughs)

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:45.103
Okay.

00:15:45.103 --> 00:15:46.060
- Go for them.

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:46.893
Take it that is a...

00:15:46.893 --> 00:15:48.773
Fist full of durian right there.

00:15:50.343 --> 00:15:51.176
Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:15:51.176 --> 00:15:52.698
- Cheers!
- Cheers, JJ.

00:15:52.698 --> 00:15:55.281
(upbeat music)

00:15:57.667 --> 00:15:58.500
- Oh yeah.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:59.770
- Oh man.

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:00.603
- Cool, cool.

00:16:00.603 --> 00:16:01.722
- Oh, yeah.

00:16:01.722 --> 00:16:02.555
(laughs)

00:16:02.555 --> 00:16:03.721
Mm.

00:16:03.721 --> 00:16:06.010
It was like, hard on the outside but

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:07.218
it's really creamy on the inside.

00:16:07.218 --> 00:16:08.509
- Yeah, very sweet too.

00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:09.342
- Mm.

00:16:09.342 --> 00:16:11.249
Just starting to gain that

00:16:11.249 --> 00:16:13.890
complexion of bitterness,
just a hint of it.

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:15.800
Butter cream...

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:16.656
Custard.

00:16:16.656 --> 00:16:17.672
- It's like alcohol taste.

00:16:17.672 --> 00:16:18.505
- Mhm.

00:16:19.505 --> 00:16:21.330
(laughing)

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:22.163
- That's awesome.

00:16:22.163 --> 00:16:23.730
- That's so much cream.

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:25.280
Oh no!

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.481
- Who dropped a piece?

00:16:26.481 --> 00:16:27.314
- You!

00:16:27.314 --> 00:16:28.147
- Me?

00:16:28.147 --> 00:16:29.340
- Yeah.
- Oh no.

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.951
(upbeat music)

00:16:31.951 --> 00:16:33.118
- Mm. Oh yeah.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.740
If you ever do a food tour anywhere.

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:41.130
There's no better way
to finish a food tour.

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:43.240
Than with natural cream.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.233
Natural custard.

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:46.233
- Any kind of tour.

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:49.030
You should always finish with durian.

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:51.718
Man that's good.

00:16:51.718 --> 00:16:54.301
(upbeat music)

00:16:57.479 --> 00:16:58.580
- Mm.

00:16:58.580 --> 00:16:59.413
Okay.

00:16:59.413 --> 00:17:00.741
And now we can call it a night!

00:17:00.741 --> 00:17:01.950
(background chatter)

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:04.880
I'm gonna go ahead and end
this Chiang Mai night market

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.150
food tour right here.

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:08.600
It's mostly kinda snacking foods.

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:09.720
So you can walk around,

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:11.600
and I'm still a little bit hungry but

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:14.420
it's packed that I'm ready to head out

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:16.430
and Mike needs to go to sleep.

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:18.260
But it's mostly a lot of snacking foods.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:19.543
The food is okay.

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:23.510
It's not like the greatest
food in my opinion,

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:25.280
but it is fun to walk around.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.750
It's a great environment.

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:28.260
It is packed.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:31.390
But that also makes it entertaining and

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:34.080
it's definitely a great place to visit

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.700
when you are in Chiang Mai.

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:39.150
Huge thank you to Tom and
JJ and Joel for joining me.

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:41.730
Me and Ying and Mica on
this food tour today.

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:43.570
