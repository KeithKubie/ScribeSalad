- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape:
bipedal, naked, large-brained. Long the

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.620
master of fire, tools and language, but
still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:30.610
Aware that death is inevitable, yet filled
with optimism. We grow up slowly. We hand

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:38.110
down knowledge. We empathize and deceive.
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:45.490
understanding of the past. CARTA brings
together experts from diverse disciplines

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:53.310
to exchange insights on who we are and how
we got here. An exploration made possible

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.101
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.980
- [Nina] I'm delighted to be here. Even 20
years ago, if someone asked you to imagine

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:56.180
or to think about human evolution, you
would think fossils. Maybe you would think

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:05.700
about bones. Rarely would you ever think
about skin. So, it's no wonder that in

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:15.410
this grand question that Ajit posed; that
skin received very short shrift. Skin,

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:22.200
after all, is rarely preserved for more
than a few thousand years, so we have no

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:29.700
or very little physical evidence of it.
So, because anthropologists and human

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:38.170
biologists like hard evidence, physical
hard evidence that they can examine, skin

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.160
for years, if it was studied at all, was
studied from the perspective of

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.510
comparative anatomy, inlcuding histology,
some physiology, some, a little bit, of

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.810
genetics.
But things have changed dramatically, and

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:01.840
in the last 20 years, skin has been
studied from a variety of perspectives.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.010
And in fact, the whole field of human
evolution is now studied from a variety of

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:13.470
perspectives. Not just fossil evidence and
a little bit of comparative anatomy, but

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:20.290
comparative and functional genomics,
evolutionary developmental biology,

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:27.710
studies of the micro-biome and a myriad
of others. We can bring so many lines of

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:35.580
evidence to bear and that's what we're
going to do today. What was almost a

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:42.700
complete mystery 20 or 25 years ago, or
something about which we knew very little,

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:49.090
we now know much more about.
Today, we have assembled a series of

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.970
scholars and many of them don't even
self-identify as evolutionary biologists,

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:02.870
but they're doing work that is highly
pertinent to human evolutionary biology.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.790
And we've brought them together because
they're doing exciting and important work

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:16.440
related to this largest organ of our
bodies that is more different than any

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:23.820
other organ system that we have, compared
to that of our closest relatives,

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:31.460
chimpanzees. What an exciting day. We're
going to be sharing in the work of some of

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:39.630
human evolution's best detectives. So,
with that brief and I hope intriguing

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:45.080
introduction, I want to introduce our
first speaker, Richard Gallo, who will

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:52.820
start us off in this marvelous journey of
discovery into the unique aspects of human

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:58.160
skin.
I'm tremendously grateful to Ajit Varki,

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:05.960
Pascal Gagneux and all of the CARTA
organizers and sponsors for making this,

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.109
which I hope will be a wonderful event,
possible.
