A great shave at a great price conveniently delivered right to your home...

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.760
Nicolas Cage: ♫ Praise me! ♫

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.920
♫ I'm crazy! ♫

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.680
♫ Oh, God! ♫

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.440
♫ OH MY GOD, NOT THE BEES!!! ♫

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.120
♫ Boom, boom, Nicolas Cage! ♫

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.600
♫ I am the Nicolas Cage! ♫

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.120
♫ Hot damn, you've just been upstaged! ♫

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.100
♫ I laugh and I rage and I break every gauge! ♫

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.660
♫ Nic Cage, I'm on a rampage! ♫

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.660
♫ Nic Cage, deranged! ♫

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.020
♫ Nic Cage, you'll scream "Hallelujah!" ♫

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.480
♫ A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H! ♫

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.000
♫ Nic Cage, it's my golden age! ♫

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.480
♫ Ridiculous Nicolas Cage! ♫

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.900
♫ Your sage, your sorcerer mage! ♫

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.200
♫ Engage, my name is ♫

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.440
Wait for it...

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.080
♫ Nicolas Cage! ♫

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.660
Critic: Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.440
Why do I keep falling for Nicolas Cage movies?

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.900
There used to be a time where when he was good,

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.960
he was amazing, and when he was bad,

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.020
he was still amazing.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.080
He was one of the most entertaining people to watch.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.880
But then, he got into making so many of them that

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.020
the Cage magic was spread too thin.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.160
Bilbo: Like butter scraped over too much bread.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.180
Critic: It wasn't as much fun anymore.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.560
Nevertheless, I still looked forward to them.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.840
Why? Because I'm a friggin' dumbass.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.420
No joke, if anyone ever involves a celebrity in something I like, I always fall for it.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.680
Hello?

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.840
Nicolas Cage(?): Hello, it's Nicolas Cage.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.940
Critic: The Nicolas Cage?!

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.380
I will in no way question this!

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.440
Nicolas Cage(?): Naturally. I want you to join me and Tony Goldmark in the other room.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.200
We'll dress like bears and sing DuckTales in Egypt.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.040
Critic: You got it!

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.280
Nicolas Cage(?): Oh, by the way, this call is collect.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.480
Tony: Because I just collected your dumb ass!

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.980
[Laughing]

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.660
Critic: Goddammit, Tony! No wonder they call you Some Jerk With A Camera!

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.600
Tony: And I got it all on camera!

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.220
[Laughing]

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.480
Critic: Well, great. You exploited my very specific foible.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.840
Tony: And it was amazing!

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:52.400
[One last ha]

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.140
Critic: So you flew all the way out here just for that, huh?

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.480
Tony: Yeah, in hindsight, it didn't really justify the cost.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.420
Critic: I mean, plane tickets, gas, hotel-

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.120
Do you have a hotel?

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.000
Tony: I slept on the roof.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.840
Critic: Good God, man.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.120
Tony: You mind if I stay here until I crowdfund my way home?

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.620
Critic: Yeah, sure.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.360
Tony: God bless ya.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.940
Ooh, The Sorcerer's Apprentice.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.560
You know, Critic, in the course of reviewing Disney rides,

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.600
I also sometimes review their movies and other projects.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:19.460
Critic: Good.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.600
Thus, in 2010, Nicolas Cage gave us another dull-saster with The Sorcerer's Appre-

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.000
Alright, get over here!

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.740
Tony: Whee!

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.420
Sorcerer's Apprentice!

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.000
In 1940, Walt Disney released perhaps his most audacious experiment

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.180
in a career of audacious experiments.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.460
Fantasia, heralded by some as Walt's masterpiece,

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.800
combined classical music with classic Disney animation

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.040
in ways no one had seen before.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.340
And its most famous sequence is The Sorcerer's Apprentice, starring Mickey Mouse.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.060
Critic: A simple story about a janitor who almost destroys the world,

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.220
it featured the mouse who started it all

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.620
in his red robe and blue hat magically controlling the cosmos,

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.420
becoming one of the most iconic images in Disney's illustrious history.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.500
Tony: Then 7 decades later, this presumably happened:

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.720
Nicolas Cage(?): Disney, I wanna play a wizard.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.120
Black Chart Guy: Well, we can certainly do that.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.120
White Chart Guy: Yes, we have a live action version of Sword in the Stone.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.620
Nicolas Cage(?): No.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:29.580
Black Chart Guy: Black Cauldron?

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:30.160
Nicolas Cage(?): No.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.380
White Chart Guy: Wizards of Waverly Place?

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.960
Nicolas Cage(?): No!

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.700
Black Chart Guy: A Wicked style Jafar movie?

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:34.320
Nicolas Cage(?): NO!

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.440
White Chart Guy: An all-male Hocus Pocus reboot?

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.900
Nicolas Cage(?): I wanna play Mickey Mouse.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:38.400
White Chart Guy: What?

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.000
Nicolas Cage(?): Mouse.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.580
Black Chart Guy: No.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:40.140
Nicolas Cage(?): Yes.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.900
Black Chart Guy: OK.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.600
Nicolas Cage(?): Just run it by my agent. He says yes to everything.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.280
White Chart Guy: We noticed.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.300
Nicolas Cage(?): Thanks, guys.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.940
Anthony: This is gonna be awesome!

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.660
Oh, man, I cannot wait to see where this one leads.

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.160
Critic: Thus, we got a movie that has little to nothing to do with The Sorcerer's Apprentice

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.920
called The Sorcerer's Apprentice.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.720
Tony: Directed by John Turteltaub...

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.500
Critic: You mean the same guy who directed?!

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:06.400
Tony: Oh, yes.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.040
3 Ninjas!

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.800
Critic: SCORE!

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.000
Tony: The film was trying to cash in on

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.360
hugely successful cinematic updates of Disney properties at the time,

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.720
like Pirates of the Caribbean and...

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.380
Pirates of the Caribbean.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.680
But where that movie had at least some connection to the original source material, this...

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.660
Critic: Had a dancing broom for a minute.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:27.580
Tony: Authentic!

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.120
Critic: Let's take a look at why the magic is gone with Sorcerer's Apprentice.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.620
Tony: It opens with a prologue so complicated,

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.600
you'd swear they were trying to squeeze in 5 other movies into this movie.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.340
Narrator: The fate of mankind rested with the just and powerful Merlin.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.280
He taught his secrets to 3 trusted apprentices:

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.800
Balthazar, Veronica, and Horvath.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.740
Critic: This is Ian McShane, by the way.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.500
I figured I'd introduce myself because

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.240
I have no idea what character I'm supposed to be in this.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.020
Nevertheless,

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.580
I'll still leave a bigger impact than Pirates 4.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.100
Narrator: Morgana la Féy, Merlin's most deadly enemy.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.160
Tony: Well, that and Transformers 5.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.240
Merlin: We are but servants.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.160
Critic: I'm gonna assume that's a different spelling.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.420
But the way this movie goes, it wouldn't surprise me.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.300
Horvath: Merlin.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.140
Merlin: Horvath.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.060
You betrayed me?

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.460
Critic: Yeah, nice read there, Spirit Halloween Storebeard.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.460
This is why the Borg Queen is assimilating you.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.660
Tony: This movie's in such a hurry, they dissolve from one shot to the exact same shot.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.360
Now, I hate it when movies do this.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.660
This was clearly a full scene at one point,

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:32.780
but it didn't work,

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.080
so they cut it down in editing

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.300
and tried to make it faster...

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.620
And that's why we should all go to Mitt Romney's house

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.100
dressed as hamsters and convince him he's a hamster, too,

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.160
when his entire human life has been a dream.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.140
Critic: Whoa, you really went off on a tangent there.

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.460
Tony: Yeah, I'll fix it in post.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.760
Narrator: Veronica sacrificed herself for Balthazar

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.180
by drawing Morgana's soul into her own body.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:58.380
Balthazar trapped them both in the Grimhold, an inescapable prison.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.960
Critic: That you can buy at your grandma's antique store.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.240
Critic: So Balthazar, played by Cage,

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.420
searches the world for Merlin's successor,

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.240
the Prime 𝘮𝘦𝘳𝘭𝘪𝘯𝘦𝘢𝘯

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.960
that will one day defeat the trapped Morgana.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.020
Tony: But he'll in no way use his powers to stop the atrocities of history.

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:18.600
Narrator: For mankind will never be safe until Morgana is destroyed.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.100
Critic: Maybe you can use those powers to stop 2 World Wars if you have the time?!

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.120
Tony: Slavery, genocide? Those'll sort themselves out.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.060
He's gotta keep the world safe.

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.180
Flash forward to our young protagonist

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.160
being awoken by his corporate masters,

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.080
heading to school.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.560
IN THE YEAR 2000!

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.900
Critic: This is David, a boy who's so new to dating that

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.760
he asks a girl out the same way a girl would ask a girl out.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.120
Yeah, where's the box for "I would like to be David's restraining order."?

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.700
But the note blows away and David chases after it.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:48.780
David: No!

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:51.220
No, lady, don't!

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:56.660
Tony: I guess I could just ask her since she clearly already knows I wrote it,

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.400
but I need the receipt for my taxes!

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.480
Critic: But he comes across Merlin's magical shop

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.640
of Gremlins-reading-The-Neverending-Story as he looks at all the mysterious wonders.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.100
Like, look, a decapitated little girl's head.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.880
♫ Na na na na na! ♫

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:14.560
Tony: He literally bumps into Cage who, as you would expect, is a little quirky.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.460
Balthazar: I have something I'd like to show you, Dave.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.220
David: How'd you know my name was Dave?

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.360
Balthazar: Because I can read minds!

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:24.520
Critic: OK, movie, Nicolas Cage is one of those people you do not need to overscore.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.560
Tony: Yeah, he's already his own strange music.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:31.380
A magic ring clings to his hand meaning he's the chosen one.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:32.300
David: No way.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.520
Tony: Because God knows why your actions should make you special,

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.800
he's just chosen!

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.500
Critic: But an evil villain is released as well.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:41.420
David: No way.

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:43.480
Critic: Is that all this twerp says?

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.880
[Clips of David saying "No way."]

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.380
Critic: This kid really knows his vocabulary from A-A.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:54.760
Horvath: That's not very sporting of you, Balthazar.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:55.720
Balthazar: Where's that doll?

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.660
Critic: Oh, apologies, I guess I could've just looked down.

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:00.460
Tony: Question 2:

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.220
How'd it get burnt?! HOW'D IT GET BURNT?!

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:07.780
The evil Horvath, played by Alfred Molina, manages to fight Cage back.

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:10.020
Horvath: I'll have that doll.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:13.120
Critic: ♫ Da da da da, da da da da! ♫

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.740
♫ I am Nicolas Cage Sparrow! ♫

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:20.240
Tony: Molina throws fire at him only to find out fire doesn't hurt him.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.860
So why did he throw fire at him?

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:25.480
Critic: They both get sucked into the magic urn

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:26.660
and David leaves the store

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.140
and coincidentally

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.520
comes across his field trip.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.560
Kid: Ew, he peed his pants!

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:32.620
Kids: [Laughing]

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.960
David: A jar broke! This is just water!

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.040
Kids: [Laughing]

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.140
Critic: Oh my God, that kid's laugh is terrifying!

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.520
Is she eating somebody's soul while laughing that hard?

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.660
Tony: Hey, you leave her alone!

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.080
She's a good friend of mine.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.240
Critic: Really?

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.140
Tony: Yeah, she grew up into a lovely woman. Look.

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:52.000
Woman: [Laughing]

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:55.520
Critic: Was she just standing there in silence until you addressed her?

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.200
Tony: It's best not to question her.

00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:03.920
Woman: [Still laughing]

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:05.200
Critic: Mmm, she's freaking me out!

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.580
Woman: [Still going]

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:09.540
How did she?!

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:13.860
Tony: I told you, it's best not to question her. Let's just continue the review.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:20.380
Woman: [Not stopping]

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.860
Critic: Cut to 10 years later, where David has grown up into man seeking plot,

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:24.980
Jay Baruchel.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.000
Tony: A shame his voice didn't grow up with him,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.120
as it constantly sounds like 2 geese fighting over rye bread.

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:37.380
[Clips of David's whininess]

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.340
Becky: Is everything OK?

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:38.920
[Honk]

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.880
Tony: He lives with the unsuccessful prototype of Ned in Spider-Man: Homecoming

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.000
and comes across an old familiar face.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.560
Dave: I'm sorry, it's...

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:47.780
Becky?

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:49.140
Becky Barnes?

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:50.740
Critic: Bucky Barnes?!

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:52.020
Tony: Hang on, I've always wanted to do this!

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:53.140
Longing

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:53.920
Rusted

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:54.900
Seventeen

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:55.400
Daybreak

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:56.320
Hey!

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.660
David: We were in fourth grade together?

00:10:58.780 --> 00:10:59.740
Becky: Yeah.

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:00.980
Critic: Yeah, in a bizarre twist,

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:03.440
this is actually the scary girl that was laughing at him

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.540
all those years ago.

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:06.400
Woman: [Starting back up again]

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.840
Tony: Oh, great! You got her going again!

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:08.600
Critic: What do we do?

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:10.300
Tony: Just let her laugh herself out.

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:13.340
Woman: [Still laughing]

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:22.040
Critic: Can we put a blanket on her or something?

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:23.440
Tony: Go ahead.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:28.520
Critic: You do it.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:30.060
Tony: No.

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.320
Critic: He helps her fix the college radio station she works at

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.440
while Cage and Molina have a vase...

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:37.940
off.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.220
Horvath: Cheerio, Balthazar!

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:49.020
Critic: You'll take me to a lawyer to stop a Dresden Files lawsuit.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:53.440
Tony: Molina finds David, and tries to force him to give him the Russian doll,

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.640
known as the Grimhold.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.660
Horvath: I'll cut the truth out of you.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.380
Critic: And at that very moment, the word nerp was created.

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:05.820
Tony: He finally figures out the sorcery of opening a door

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:07.520
and Molina sends wolves after him.

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:11.000
Though, honestly, there's about a billion ways he could've just kept him in that room.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.240
But it's cool, Cage turns them into puppies!

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.140
David: Puppies?

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:16.560
Critic: If he could turn the wolves into puppies,

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.720
how come he couldn't turn Molina into a baby?

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.180
Tony: Because then, he'd have to raise him with Holly Hunter,

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:22.760
and the Coens already have enough repeating.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.380
Critic: Cage flies in, though, on a pretty badass metal eagle.

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:27.820
David: No way.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.220
Balthazar: Where's the doll, Dave?

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:33.280
Critic: That's exactly what I want Nicolas Cage riding a badass metal eagle to say.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.700
Tony: They escape and Dave tries to take in the situation.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.880
Balthazar: I've been stuck in an urn for the last 10 years.

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:40.060
David: So have I!

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.800
A figurative urn of ridicule!

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.980
Tony: That line of dialogue guest directed by Judd Apatow.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:47.660
Critic: It shows.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.860
Hey, here's a fun game.

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:52.582
Try to spot the moment where Nicolas Cage actually seems invested

00:12:52.582 --> 00:12:53.420
in what he's saying.

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:57.320
Balthazar: It is a prison for the most dangerous Morganians in history.

00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:01.920
Horvath wants to free his fellow Morganians and destroy the world.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.620
You have a very special gift.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.180
Tony: Trick question!

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:08.920
There are no moments when he's invested in this!

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.720
It's so weird. He just looks and sounds so bored.

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:15.100
The whole movie is stunningly devoid of

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:17.980
Nicolas Cage freakouts or any energy to speak of.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:21.600
You know how he likes to alternate between screaming and soft muttering?

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.220
Here, it's just soft muttering for the whole movie.

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.940
It's Nicolas Cage as a sorcerer!

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.420
How is this dull?!

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.700
Balthazar: Until he found a sorcerer who would inherit his power.

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:34.500
Focuses your energy, helps you master new spells.

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.540
You have to become the Prime Merlinean.

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:38.020
You're going to set me free.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:01.600
Critic: You see, this is what I'm talking about!

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.120
There's no more Nicholas Cage freakout movies anymore!

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.600
I always think it's gonna be one, and it never is!

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.600
Well, you know what? I'm not gonna be that gullible again!

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:11.420
Hello?

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.180
Sargent Slaughter(?): Hello, this is Sargent Slaughter.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:14.340
Critic: Yo, Joe!

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:17.300
Sargent Slaughter(?): I was wondering if you wanted to team up with me and Devil Boner

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:19.140
in the other room to travel to Africa

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:21.400
and wrestle lions until their heads explode.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.820
Critic: You got it! I'll be right there!

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:26.380
Devil Boner: [Laughing]

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:27.680
Critic: Goddammit, you guys!

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:29.640
Devil Boner: Hey, Jerk with a Camera!

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:31.940
Tony: Hey, Devil Boner! You play one on him, too?

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.540
Devil Boner: It's so easy!

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:36.900
Tony: I know, right? He is so stupid!

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.900
Tony and Devil Boner: [Laughing]

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:40.860
Woman: [Joins in]

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:41.840
Critic: Dammit, you got her going!

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:45.100
Tony and Devil Boner: [Still laughing]

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:46.920
Devil Boner: [Finishes laughing]

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.260
Critic: So Cage gives Dave a crash course in...

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.000
[Sigh]

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.960
the science of magic.

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:56.820
Actually, they do that surprisingly a lot in this movie.

00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:59.440
Balthazar: Everything we see is in a constant state of vibration,

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.300
thus the illusion of solidity.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:02.820
Sorcerers can manipulate matter

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:06.120
because they're born with the capability to use the entire power of their brain.

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:08.060
We will the vibrations to go faster.

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.900
David: Is sorcery science or magic?

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:10.920
Balthazar: Yes and yes.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:11.680
Tony: No and no.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:14.520
When you try to shoehorn science into magic,

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:16.980
all you do is make it less fun for the fantasy lovers

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:20.080
and even more infuriating for the science nerds!

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:23.680
Critic: We don't need to know the science of the Flux Capacitor.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.320
We don't need the engineering manual for the Ring of Power.

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:28.380
Do you want midichlorians?

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:30.180
Because this is how you get midichlorians!

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:32.500
They go to Chinatown to see if they have any of that

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.340
Mulan Szechuan dipping sauce.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:35.240
Bad news, they don't.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:35.740
Tony: Oh.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:39.840
Critic: So they decide to look for the doll which they trace back to an acupuncturist.

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.120
This leads to a lot of comedic antics.

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:46.720
David: Hi!

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.680
Critic: Alright, that's all he could come up with. Let's see how Cage is doing.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.640
Cantonese Woman: Do you have an appointment?

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:58.120
Tony: OK, his piss poor Cantonese is all the comedy we need.

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:02.920
Critic: But Goro's less impressive 2 armed brother tries to attack.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:08.020
Oh my God, I have no idea how to train these!

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:13.580
Balthazar: Be still.

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.560
Critic and Tony: NOT THE BEADS! NOT THE BEADS!

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:25.720
Critic: Jesus, Susan Sarandon's dragon from Enchanted looked more real!

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.320
Balthazar: This is it.

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.560
Yogurt: Use the Schwartz.

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:35.120
Critic: The dragon is defeated just as the cops show up on the scene.

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:36.100
Cop: Hey, what do you got?

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:38.420
Tony: We had reports of a Nicolas Cage movie on the loose?

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:42.180
Balthazar: Bottle rocket meets paper dragon in this Asian festival,

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:43.220
and between you and me, cap,

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:46.020
I think some of these folks were hitting the sake pretty hard.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.600
Critic: Glad to know his New York is as good as his Cantonese.

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:51.920
Tony: Does he think New York is Boston?

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:54.580
Cage takes Nerpface to a safe place

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:57.380
to train him as he opens up the book to open up the book.

00:16:58.020 --> 00:16:58.980
Balthazar: The art,

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:00.860
science,

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:03.180
history of sorcery,

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.800
including our recent history as well.

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:10.880
Critic: OK, that was pretty cool.

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:11.760
Tony: Yeah, give them a point.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.620
Balthazar: This is the Merlin Circle.

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:15.960
Once you enter,

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:20.340
there is no going back.

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:22.380
David: So I should probably pee first?

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:24.700
I can hold it.

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.880
Critic: You know, the first time I did a Bruckheimer production,

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:29.460
I was teamed up with Sean Connery.

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:31.240
What life choices brought me here?

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:46.320
Doug: You know, a lot of people have been asking me recently, "Are you Walter White?"

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.360
And I say yes.

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:49.880
So they ask, "Walter.", and I say, "Mr. Cranston.", and they say, "Sorry.

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.320
How do you get your head so smooth?"

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.040
Well, that's the Dollar Shave Club.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:57.080
I use the DSC Executive Razor and it's one of the smoothest I've ever used.

00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:59.560
And as someone who had a lot of hair to get rid of

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:02.500
(yeah, a fair amount, I mean, between Kelsey Grammar and Patrick Stewart),

new members get their first month of the Executive Razor with a tube of Dr. Carver's Shave Butter

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:12.400

for only $5 with free shipping.

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:17.400
That's a $15 value for only $5.

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:19.820
And after that, the razor's only a few bucks a month.

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.480

Nah, nah, I'm just kidding.

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:37.900
I'm Bryan Cranston.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.140
So check out the Dollar Shave Club today.

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.240
Narrator: From the studio that brought you The Sorcerer's Apprentice

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:51.300
comes the next big step in world building.

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:53.140
David: Balthazar, I heard it down here!

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:55.900
I...I...I...I...I...I...I...I...I...I...I don't know what to do!

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:59.160
Balthazar: Stay here, you incredible pussy. I'll go check it out.

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.540
???: You think you're the only sorcerer in the world?

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:05.420
Balthazar, you've become part of a much bigger symphony.

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:07.360
Balthazar: Who the hell are you?!

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:12.380
???: Stokowski, conductor of the orchestra.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:13.160
Balthazar: Leopold!

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.420
David: L...L...L...Leopold!

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:18.260
Leopold: I'm here to tell you about the Fantasia initiative.

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:28.240
Narrator: Start Phase 1 in 2018 with Night on Bald Mountain with Jared Leto as Chernabog.

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:31.040
Chernabog: Fire! Tits! Skeletons! Demons!

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.560
Skeleton demons with their tits on fire!

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:34.340
[Cackling]

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:35.540
I'm the devil!

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.200
Agent: Mr. Leto, you're wanted on set.

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:39.900
Jared Leto: I'm on set in my mind.

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:42.860
Agent: Whatever stops you from mailing me sex toys.

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:49.080
Narrator: And in 2019, Dance of the Hours with Scarlett Johansson as the ostrich.

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:51.540
Ostrich: I was a dancer trained at the red room.

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.120
At graduation, they sterilized me.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:56.220
I can never lay another egg again.

00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:57.900
Those hippos will pay.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.560
Narrator: Coming Year 2020, Jack Black is Bacchus in The Pastoral Symphony.

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:06.460
Bacchus: ♫ Mmm, gonna fuck 'em all 'till the break of dawn, y'all! ♫

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:12.800
Narrator: In 2021, Selena Gomez is the Sugarplum Fairy in Nutcracker.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.460
Sugarplum Fairy: Oh my God, guys, I am a fairy!

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:16.580
I just...wow!

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:24.400
Narrator: In 2022, Daniel Day-Lewis returns to the silver screen as a dinosaur in Rite of Spring.

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:25.980
Dino Rob: Hey, you can't prove who's under here.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:31.700
Narrator: And finally, in 2023, Bryan Cranston in Breaking Bach.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:38.900
Walter White: I want abstract imagery, not too vague, not too specific, spread out as far as the eye can see!

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.060
David: No way! I mean, what are you, crazy?

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.020
Walter White: You're goddamn right.

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.780
Narrator: They all join forces in:

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:52.180
Never has there been such a misguided franchise with so many celebrities attached.

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.760
OK, there's been several, but this one's especially embarrassing!

00:20:56.100 --> 00:21:01.040
Bette Midler: Hi, I'm Bette Midler. Let me treat you like a dumbass by calling Salvador Dali the melting watch guy.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.700
Narrator: You're too early. That's for Phase 2.

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:03.600
Bette Midler: Oh, my bad.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:11.240
Narrator: Right after we finish the Marvel, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Muppets, Pirates, and Disneynature cinematic universes.

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:12.940
And also, our new animated films.

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:14.100
And Pixar's.

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.760
And like 50 live action remakes.

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:20.480
But once we finish our live action Home on the Range, we promise we'll get around to it!

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:21.560
Balthazar: You're lying, aren't ya?

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:22.120
Narrator: Yes, we are.

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:22.640
Balthazar: Yeah.

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.880
Critic: So Molina gets the help of another magician called Drake Stone,

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:39.140
an obvious David Blaine ripoff who apparently uses his real magic to entertain people.

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:43.740
Tony: Fun fact: This was actually the same actor who played Dr. Doom in Fant4stic.

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:46.340
Drake: My master disappeared when I was 15! Vanished!

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:50.360
Left me with nothing but an encantus and some prescription-grade abandonment issues!

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:52.240
Critic: I'm still taking him more seriously here.

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:52.840
Tony: Me, too.

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.500
Critic: Cage continues to train David when-

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:56.880
David: Hi!

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:57.380
Becky Barnes: Hi!

00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:58.400
David: We should go.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:21:59.500
Critic: Who's that?

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:01.860
Tony: The girl from earlier.

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:04.380
The Winter Soldier?

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:06.440
Critic: Oh, right, right. That was this movie?

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:07.340
Tony: That was this movie.

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:08.420
Critic: I completely forgot.

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:09.240
Tony: Eh, we all did.

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:13.440
25 minutes offscreen, we're reintroduced to Bucky Barnes-

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.460
Critic: Just call her Winter Soldier. It's the only way I'll remember her.

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:16.040
Tony: Sounds good.

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:19.640
And we're supposed to just pick up where their non-existent chemistry left off.

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:22.440
David: I think you'd better step into my cage.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.900
Tony: It might be a little crowded inside him,

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:27.240
but there's always room for one more voice in his head.

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:29.560
Critic: He shows how the electric coils,

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:32.080
when positioned right, can actually make musical sounds.

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.940
David: The coils are firing at such a high frequency

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:38.140
that the sparks literally create sound waves

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:39.060
when they fly though the air,

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:39.720
which is...

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:41.060
nerdy!

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:44.180
Oh, I'm sappy.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.920
Critic: You know, he really is the poor man's Andrew Garfield.

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:48.380
Tony: Andrew Heathcliff.

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:49.080
Critic: Ooh, very good.

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.740
Tony: The next day, when he's going to the bathroom,

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:53.800
he's accosted by Russel Offbrand.

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:56.680
Drake: Prime Merlinian, eh? You don't look like much.

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.120
Critic: Oh, I'm sorry, miss, this is the men's room.

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:04.540
But Cage comes to save him from both Molina and Borat Zoolander.

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:07.620
To be fair, he does use probably the film's best sound effect.

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:14.160
Why does that insanity work and none of the other madness does?

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:16.100
Tony: Don't worry, it's followed by a stupid line.

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.020
Balthazar: What are you doing here, Dave?

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:19.960
Tony: Working on my master's thesis.

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.580
What do you think I'm doing in the bathroom?!

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:24.060
Critic: Well, that exposition in the opening

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:25.000
was so much fun.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.240
Let's literally have it told to us again.

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.320
Yeah, I'm not even kidding,

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.880
everything that was said to us in the intro

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:32.840
is repeated back to us pretty much for no reason. Watch.

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.520
Balthazar: Morgana.

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:38.520
She was making preparations for something that would enable her to enslave mankind.

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:41.060
Merlin had 3 apprentices. I was one of them.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:41.980
Janosz: You've told me this. I've heard all of this.

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:43.000
Balthazar: Until he found a sorcerer who would inherit his power.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.560
Balthazar: Until he found a sorcerer who would inherit his power.

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:47.080
Tony: In all fairness, did you even listen in the beginning?

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.160
Critic: No, because I'm sick of listening in general!

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.580
I'm tired of people and movies taking advantage of me!

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:53.920
Hello?

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:54.780
Stanley Kubrick(?): Mm-hmm.

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:56.500
Critic: This is world renowned director Stanley Kubrick?

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:57.180
Stanley Kubrick(?): Mm-hmm!

00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:59.540
Critic: You've come back from the dead and are with Bill in the other room?

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:00.040
Stanley Kubrick(?): Mm-hmm.

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:02.620
Critic: You're gonna shoot The Nostalgia Critic Movie on the set of the moon?!

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:03.320
Stanley Kubrick(?): Mm-hmm!

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.220
Critic: I'll be right there!

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:04.760
Stanley Kubrick(?): Mm-hmm.

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:05.260
Critic: Woohoo!

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:09.000
Bill: [Laughing in an mm-hmm manner]

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:09.940
Critic: OH!

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:14.240
Tony: [Giggling]

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:18.920
Bill: [Finishes laughing]

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:22.600
Tony: Speaking of bad jokes,

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.700
take a look at this fascinatingly botched

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:26.300
Star Wars homage.

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:30.880
Horvath: You don't need to see my faculty identification card.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.020
Guard: I don't need your faculty identification card.

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.640
Drake: These are not the droids you're looking for.

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:37.580
[Laughing]

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:40.780
Tony: The lesson, kids,

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:42.960
is if you can't be bothered to think of something original,

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:45.460
just steal something and admit you're stealing it.

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:47.700
That's the same thing as actual creativity.

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:48.300
Kinda.

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:52.200
Critic: After we see the dog presumably piss on a Fantasia DVD,

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.660
Dave realizes he has to get the place clean for his girlfriend.

00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:58.060
Tony: This is the plot now.

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.300
And as you'd imagine,

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:03.880
a mere 62 minutes into this Sorcerer's Apprentice remake,

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:07.120
they finally remake The Sorcerer's Apprentice.

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:08.040
𝑷𝑶𝑶𝑹𝑳𝒀.

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.940
Critic: Sucktastic is how I would put it.

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:12.940
Tony: In Fantasia, the brooms went out of control

00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:14.580
because Mickey was off daydreaming.

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:16.140
And not just any daydream,

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:18.860
he was dreaming about being a god,

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:20.300
controlling the cosmos,

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:23.480
altering the fabric of reality to suit his every whim.

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.420
Kinda like the real Mickey Mouse, come to think of it.

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:29.360
What is Dave off doing while this while this Flubber dance is going on?

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.780
Showering and brushing his tongue.

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:33.020
Whimsical.

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:37.540
Critic: Yeah, it's a little ironic that Mickey used magic to be lazy with his chores

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:41.040
while Dave is using chores to be lazy with his magic.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.880
David: I command you to stop!

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:48.280
Tony: Wow, that line read was so bad, it stopped the whole movie.

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:52.520
Even that spray bottle is like, "I'm Windex and I could've read that line better."

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:00.940
Critic: Oh, look, the shadow of him with the ax!

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:04.060
They're so similar, I can barely tell the difference!

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:05.900
Tony: Even that isn't done right!

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:09.540
In the original, it was intense, like a friggin' horror film.

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:12.300
He just whales on that thing until there's nothing left.

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:15.320
Here, it's just slow, random, and dull.

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:21.220
Critic: So the Mickey Mouse cartoon

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:24.480
is actually more intense than the Nicholas Cage movie?

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:25.900
Tony: What is world?

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:28.500
Critic: Cage comes to save the day,

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:33.120
making us realize if you cut the Sorcerer's Apprentice scene out of The Sorcerer's Apprentice,

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.340
absolutely nothing would be lost from the story.

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.740
But look, he has something pointy on his head! Authentic!

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:42.140
Tony: This whole scene is like when a little kid retells a joke he heard

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:44.180
𝑾𝑰𝑻𝑯𝑶𝑼𝑻 𝑼𝑵𝑫𝑬𝑹𝑺𝑻𝑨𝑵𝑫𝑰𝑵𝑮 𝑾𝑯𝑨𝑻 𝑴𝑨𝑫𝑬 𝑰𝑻 𝑭𝑼𝑵𝑵𝒀!

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:49.180
Balthazar: This...must...not...happen.

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.060
Tony: Dave sends the Winter Soldier away,

00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:53.760
but for some reason, she is in no way bothered by this.

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:55.880
Becky: Do you really think that one botched date

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:57.740
was gonna make me hate you forever?

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.520
Critic: You can just replace all her dialogue with "SUPPORT! SUPPORT! SUPPORT!"

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.180
Tony: Originally, this was her stand-in.

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:05.100
David: Are you afraid of heights?

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:06.000
Becky: A little bit.

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:06.660
David: Trust me.

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:07.460
Yoinkyoink.

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:08.920
Becky: [Silent gasp]

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:09.860
Wow.

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:11.540
David: Yeah.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:15.160
Critic: No, I mean I didn't know I could piss myself 8 times simultaneously!

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:18.560
Becky: Do you remember when you drew King Kong on the bus window

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:21.860
and he lined up with the Empire State Building?

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:25.760
You saw the world in your own way.

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:29.740
Tony: I am trying to find some reason to be attracted to you.

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:33.340
Critic: But Molina ambushes Cage and takes the doll from him.

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.260
Horvath: It's lighter than I remember.

00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:39.240
Critic and Tony: SO'S THE SOURCE MATERIAL!

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:43.440
Critic: But Dave returns and they chase down the villains to get the doll back.

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.220
David: OH!

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.740
Uh...uh...uh...what the heck is this?

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:53.060
Critic: Is he turning into a Mars Attacks Martian?

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:54.240
David: Uh...uh...uh...

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:56.600
Martian: Ack, ack ack, ack, ack ack!

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.260
Tony: The villains escape and realize they need reinforcements to win,

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:03.180
so they bring another friend alive to kidnap Dave's girlfriend.

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:07.000
Abigail: I said I'd like to make a request.

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:10.940
Tony: OK, this might work.

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:13.780
Critic: Yeah, new character, looks kinda creepy and badass.

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:15.020
Let's see what they do with her.

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:16.940
Horvath: I need your power to free Morgana.

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:19.480
I just don't need you.

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.040
Critic and Tony: WHAT THE HELL?!

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.700
Critic: We didn't even see how she kidnapped the girlfriend!

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:24.740
Or use any magic!

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:26.260
Or fought anybody off!

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:30.100
Tony: Critic, Critic, Critic, they had to use that time for more important scenes.

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:30.780
Critic: Like what?!

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.140
David: I command you to stop!

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:35.480
Critic: Oh, yeah, 'cause that got a big laugh!

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.180
Woman: [Laughing yet again]

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:36.760
Critic: Oh, shut up!

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:38.760
Woman: [Still laughing]

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:42.000
Tony: Dave tries to get the doll back while Molina watches on.

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:54.260
Horvath: C'mon, Dave, you know the drill. Give me what I want and I'll let her go.

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:55.940
Critic: You've seen this done in a million movies.

00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:58.280
We're not very original, so this'll be a million and one.

00:28:59.120 --> 00:28:59.700
Tony: Help.

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:00.420
Critic: Silence.

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:03.600
Horvath: Give me Merlin's ring and the Grimhold.

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:05.120
Satipo: Throw me the idol, I throw you the whip!

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:10.600
Critic: He, of course, hands it over and Cage realizes he has to take this on by himself.

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:12.980
Balthazar: No one knows how much time they have...

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:17.160
to be with the people that are the most important.

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:18.260
Enjoy it.

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:20.980
Critic: I have no idea what I'm talking about.

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:25.480
Bennet: Bad time, Dave!

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:28.820
Critic: Oh, wow, this film is just full of people I forgot were even in it!

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000
Tony: I'm still waiting for them to cut back to the disgruntled army general,

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.300
the Olympic gymnast fighting for the girl's affection,

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:36.380
and the CGI giraffe voiced by Larry David.

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:38.180
Critic: None of those were in this movie.

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:40.180
Tony: But for a moment, you thought they might be.

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:42.900
David: This is very dangerous.

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:44.380
Becky: I wanna come with you.

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:47.540
David: You're sexy.

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:49.700
Critic and Tony: Huh?

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:53.460
Critic: Bad enough he has a voice as fragile as a Faberge egg,

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:56.460
but couldn't you give him a slightly cool line?

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:57.320
David: You're sexy.

00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.780
Tony: Move over, Tobey Maguire, we have a new...

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:04.100
Critic: So Morgana is released while still in Veronica's body

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:07.760
as she tries to raise all the dead sorcerers to destroy the world.

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:12.040
Morgana: I cannot raise the dead until the circle is complete.

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:14.080
Tony: Man, that is a goal-centered woman.

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.760
No "How long have I been out?"

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.160
or "What happened over the centuries?"

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:19.460
or "Has Disney bought everything by this point?"

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:23.160
But Cage tries to stop them and they have...

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:25.640
well, there's only one way to put it: a wizard's duel.

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:27.180
Mad Madam Mim: No disappearing!

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:33.720
Tony: 𝗪𝗛𝗘𝗥𝗘 𝗧𝗛𝗘 𝗛𝗘𝗟𝗟 𝗜𝗦 𝗧𝗛𝗔𝗧 𝗟𝗜𝗧𝗧𝗟𝗘 𝗚𝗜𝗥𝗟 𝗦𝗧𝗔𝗧𝗨𝗘‽ 𝗜 𝗚𝗢𝗧 𝗔 𝗦𝗖𝗢𝗥𝗘 𝗧𝗢 𝗦𝗘𝗧𝗧𝗟𝗘!

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:40.780
You know, could we get more New York statues in on this?

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:45.100
I wanna see Vladimir Lenin, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Balto fight to the death.

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:46.760
Then we'll get the Statue of Liberty

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:49.480
to rampage through the city to the tune of Higher and Higher.

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:51.260
Critic: This movie's stolen enough already.

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.700
Tony: Haven't you learned anything?

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:55.620
It's not stealing if you admit that it's stealing.

00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:59.415
Just have Dave say, "Hey, that looks like Ghostbusters 2!"

00:30:59.415 --> 00:31:00.340
Problem solved.

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:03.100
Woman: [Laughing one more time]

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:06.220
Tony: Cage gets Morgana out and for no given reason,

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:08.880
Dave can fight her without his ring because...

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.880
something something ruby slippers.

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:15.220
Critic: ♫ I put a spell on you! ♫

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:17.720
♫ And now, you're gone! ♫

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:19.280
David: But I'm not alone!

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:21.540
I brought a little science with me!

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:25.220
Tony: Yup, the science of a mop that can move of its own power.

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:26.860
SCIENCE RULES!

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:31.840
Critic: Well, I guess you could say the mop...

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:34.420
cleaned up this mess.

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:37.280
[YEAH!]

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:41.800
Tony: So Morgana is destroyed and oh, no, it looks like Cage is, too.

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:46.440
David: Nononono, it's not over, he can't die!

00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:47.220
I just...

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:48.800
Not...not now!

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:53.120
Critic: Gee, I can't believe they killed off the main character in a Disney film.

00:31:53.180 --> 00:32:01.700
Tony: Yeah, just like Snow White and Pinocchio and Trusty and Aurora and Darby O'Gill and Baloo and Robin Hood and Chief and Gurgi

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:11.580
and Basil and The Beast and Iago and Esmeralda and Megara and Giselle and WALL-E and Flynn and Iron Man and Ralph and Anna and Baymax.

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.180
Critic: Well, I, for one, am shocked.

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.060
David: That's not good enough.

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:18.640
You...you, with all your stupid rules!

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:21.220
And all those old man shoes!

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:23.920
You're constantly saving me with that look in your eyes!

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:25.960
Critic: You will believe you're...

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:28.300
watching a movie.

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:31.420
Tony: Of course, Cage comes back

00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:33.780
and Dave is reunited with his totally useless girlfriend

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:36.380
and they fly the eagle to Isengard to rescue Gandalf.

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:53.300
Critic: And that was Nicolas Cage and The Sorcerer's Apprentice.

00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:56.420
How is this not fun?!

00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:01.140
Tony: One of the biggest creative risks of Walt Disney's career

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:05.160
has been turned into one of the least creatively risky movies I've ever seen.

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:08.540
The tired-ass chosen one story is beyond half-needed

00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:09.880
and it's not even done well.

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:11.160
There's no build to it.

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:13.460
He goes from incompetent to all-powerful

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:15.500
at the end like an on/off switch.

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:18.060
Critic: Sometimes, there's kinda neat effects

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:20.300
or kinda cool acting from Alfred Molina,

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:23.400
but that's as far as it gets, just kinda cool.

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:25.820
Tony: You know how most Disney Bruckheimer movies

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:29.120
are these insanely long 2-and-a-half-hour monstrosities?

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:31.640
This feels like it was shot to be one of those,

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:33.640
but then cut down to an hour-45.

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:36.600
So it still has the bloated structure of a long-ass movie,

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:38.640
which makes feel longer than it actually is.

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:43.180
Not even Nicolas Cage as a friggin' sorcerer can make it interesting!

00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:46.060
Critic: It sucks seeing Nicolas Cage go from awesomely good

00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:48.540
to awesomely bad to just bad.

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:51.880
And I can tell you, with him averaging 6 movies a year now,

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:55.440
I am not falling for the Nicolas Cage hype train again.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:56.860
Maybe somewhere down the line,

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:59.300
we'll get one of those kickass performances again.

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:02.320
But until then, I am not being nearly as gullible!

00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:08.000
Hello?

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:09.240
Corey Taylor(?): Hey, it's Corey Taylor.

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:12.080
Critic: Corey Taylor, lead singer of Slipknot?

00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:13.400
Corey Taylor(?): And Stone Sour, yeah.

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:15.480
Critic: And let me guess, you're in the other room with...

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:20.160
Chester A. Bum, Hyper Fangirl, Black Willy Wonka, Rob Scallon, and...

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:23.320
your son Griff, inviting us to go on tour on...

00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:24.740
an ice cream truck?

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.540
Corey Taylor(?): Actually, that's it, exactly.

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:28.960
Critic: Screw you, buddy! I'm smarter than you think!

00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:32.080
Tony: Proud of ya, man.

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:32.840
Critic: Thank you.

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:34.480
Chester A. Bum: Well?

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:36.180
Corey Taylor: He said no.

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:37.720
Hyper Fangirl: Oh, that's a shame.

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:38.660
Rob Scallon: At least we tried.

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:39.680
Black Willy Wonka: Oh, well.

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:42.140
Corey Taylor: Mmm, I guess we'll go on tour without him.

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:42.840
Black Willy Wonka: Mm-hmm.

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:41.920
David: Uh...uh...uh...what the heck is this?
