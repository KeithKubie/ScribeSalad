about 11 dimensions rather than the four

that we know I was just wondering

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629
that we know I was just wondering
 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.520

in ordinary space you can go around in a

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430
in ordinary space you can go around in a
 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.330
in ordinary space you can go around in a
circle and come back to the same point

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340
circle and come back to the same point
 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.300

time is there's only one time dimension

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310
time is there's only one time dimension
 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.580
time is there's only one time dimension
so far and we can only go in one

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590
so far and we can only go in one
 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.819
so far and we can only go in one
direction in time now imagine we had two

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829
direction in time now imagine we had two
 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.990

times two time coordinates and time

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000
times two time coordinates and time
 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.630
times two time coordinates and time
would be sort of like a plane and you

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640
would be sort of like a plane and you
 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.249
would be sort of like a plane and you
could move in time in a circle and come

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259
could move in time in a circle and come
 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.590
could move in time in a circle and come
back to the same point the same instant

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600
back to the same point the same instant
 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.810
back to the same point the same instant
and once you start imagining coming back

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820
and once you start imagining coming back
 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.600
and once you start imagining coming back
the same instant in time you get into

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610
the same instant in time you get into
 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.149
the same instant in time you get into
all sorts of problems much like you have

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159
all sorts of problems much like you have
 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.270
all sorts of problems much like you have
when you contemplate time travel where

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280
when you contemplate time travel where
 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.600
when you contemplate time travel where
you can move back in time and then just

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610
you can move back in time and then just
 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.050
you can move back in time and then just
sit there until this instant

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060
sit there until this instant
 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.870
sit there until this instant
is so I could come back if I could time

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880
is so I could come back if I could time
 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.570
is so I could come back if I could time
travel to this very instant in space and

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580
travel to this very instant in space and
 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.210
travel to this very instant in space and
time that gives rise to all sorts of

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220
time that gives rise to all sorts of
 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.640
time that gives rise to all sorts of
causality paradoxes you could go back

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650
causality paradoxes you could go back
 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.260
causality paradoxes you could go back
and kill your grandmother and then you

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270
and kill your grandmother and then you
 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.839
and kill your grandmother and then you
