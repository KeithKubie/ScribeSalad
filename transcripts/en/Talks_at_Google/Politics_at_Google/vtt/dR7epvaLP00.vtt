[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.840
JEFF ALBERTSON: Please join
me in welcoming to Google

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.060
Seattle, Masha Alyokhina.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:09.850
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:10.683
MASHA ALYOKHINA: Hi.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.770
JEFF ALBERTSON: Masha is a
founding member of Pussy Riot

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.070
and a political activist.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.000
She is also an author,
poet, musician,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.950
mother of a young
son, and an actor,

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.390
having appeared as herself in
an episode of "House of Cards"

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.240
and on stage this
week in Seattle

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.270
in the Belarus Free Theater's
production of "Burning

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.330
Doors," which is a
play based on her life

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.670
and those of two
other activists, which

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.040
runs through this
Sunday at On the Boards.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.710
And tickets remain available.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.320
I understand it's
a great production.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.410
Her memoir of her time as
a prisoner of conscience

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.005
in Russia, "Riot Days," was
published three days ago.

00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:56.380
And as I told Masha, I am
roughly halfway through reading

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.900
it myself.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:05.290
With her fellow Pussy Riot
member, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova,

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.410
she founded Zona Prava,
an organization which

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.270
defends prisoners' rights.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.790
She's a recipient of the
Lennon Ono Grant for Peace

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.030
as well as the Hannah Arendt
prize for Political Thought.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.710
So I've mentioned
that books will

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.510
be for sale after we're
done and, I think,

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:23.570
a bit about the format.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.727
So let's get right
into some questions.

00:01:26.727 --> 00:01:27.310
Are you ready?

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.018
MASHA ALYOKHINA: So
many things about me.

00:01:29.018 --> 00:01:30.060
I even don't know.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.570
JEFF ALBERTSON: OK, well, if
any question is out of bounds

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.910
or uncomfortable for you,
that's perfectly all right.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.080
But let's get right to it.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.880
I want to get to the events that
are the focus of "Riot Days."

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.950
But before we do,
could you just tell us

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.690
a bit about your
life in Russia prior

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.110
to the founding of Pussy Riot?

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.380
You know, where were
you born and raised?

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.360
What was your life
like growing up?

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.640
Maybe a bit about
your education and how

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.980
you formed your social and
political consciousness.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.070
MASHA ALYOKHINA: I
was born in Moscow

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.945
in 1988, which is an
amazing time in Russia.

00:02:06.945 --> 00:02:08.310
It's Perestroika time.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.450
So it's kind of the
end of Soviet Union

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.430
and rising up Russia.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.100
So in my passport,
I'm from USSR,

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.170
but it's last year
of USSR, actually.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.310
My mother, she's a programmist.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.280
And my father, he is a
mathematics professor.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.710
And I was growing
up with my mother.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:52.080
So I met my father
when I was a teenager.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:03:01.950
And there were almost no
talking politics in our family.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.390
But somehow, I was kind
of a problematic child.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.750
So I changed five schools.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.920
All of them I left
by myself, because I

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.230
hated the system of education,
so-called education.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.260
Because it's totally Soviet
Union system in which

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.330
they want you to follow the
rules but not asking questions.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.630
And I love questions.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:38.370
So that's how I
think it all started.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:44.280
And before Pussy Riot, I was--

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.780
well, it's a big circle of
totally different people.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.470
For example, I started all
my activism from ecology.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.180
When I knew that some
government officials close

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.290
to former presidents
of Russia, Medvedev,

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:10.530
want to cut the forest I really
love, I start a campaign,

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.150
like, a small campaign.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.140
We were like five people
meeting on the subway

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.640
and collecting signatures.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.779
But after one year, there
was more than 10,000 people

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:25.230
around Russia, and we won.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.630
But in the end of the
story, I was quite--

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:36.600
well, I understood that it's
a totally wrong situation when

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:44.040
you need to do, every
day, activism for,

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.067
like, making results of one
signature of one fucking

00:04:48.067 --> 00:04:48.900
government official.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:05:05.620
I started to knew about
different forms of protest.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.320
And I start to read
about political art.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.590
I start to meet
different people.

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.395
And that's how I think
Pussy Riot started.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.870
JEFF ALBERTSON: So there
was a significant transition

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.560
in Russian society at the
start of the new millennium

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.620
between Boris Yeltsin
and Vladimir Putin,

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.660
as President of Russia.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.780
And in your book,
you write about this.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:40.090
You note that at the time
Putin said, we need stability.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:46.000
And then you go on
to say, stability

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.364
was what he called himself.

00:05:47.364 --> 00:05:48.280
MASHA ALYOKHINA: Yeah.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.238
JEFF ALBERTSON: Could
you expand on that a bit?

00:05:50.238 --> 00:05:53.902
What is this notion of
stability in your mind?

00:05:53.902 --> 00:05:55.360
MASHA ALYOKHINA:
Well, yes, this is

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.760
one of his favorite
words, stability.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.900
But it's hypocritic shit.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.580
It's not about stability.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.060
It's about being a
president until he will die

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.630
and stealing money
from Russian people

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.840
and spending them
in their circles.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.080
So it's not about stability.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:23.800
Actually, we went to the
Cathedral of Christ the Savior,

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.910
because in the beginning
of the third term,

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.180
Putin started to use
church for approving

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:41.230
his endless presidency, saying
that he is kind of sent by God

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.360
to be a president of Russia.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.840
And Patriarch Kirill, who was
the head of the Orthodox Church

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.710
and very influential
person in Russian society,

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:54.460
started to approve this, saying
that true Christians should not

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:58.040
go to the demonstrations
and so on.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.930
Well, so we decide to do a song.

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.280
[LAUGHS]

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.690
JEFF ALBERTSON: So
Pussy Riot was formed.

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:14.847
You formed it with
several other women.

00:07:14.847 --> 00:07:16.180
MASHA ALYOKHINA: Not only women.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.110
JEFF ALBERTSON: Not only women?

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.830
MASHA ALYOKHINA: Yeah.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:18.530
JEFF ALBERTSON: Also men?

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:19.690
MASHA ALYOKHINA: Yeah, why not?

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:20.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:21.940
JEFF ALBERTSON: Very well.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.890
And as it came
together you began

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:27.977
to organize what
you called actions.

00:07:27.977 --> 00:07:29.560
Could you talk about
a typical action?

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.050
You write, for
example, in the book

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:35.260
about an action at Lobnoye
Mesto, which is a large stone

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.577
platform near Red Square and
outside the Kremlin walls.

00:07:38.577 --> 00:07:39.452
MASHA ALYOKHINA: Yes.

00:07:39.452 --> 00:07:40.952
JEFF ALBERTSON:
What happened there,

00:07:40.952 --> 00:07:42.548
and what was a
typical action like?

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.910
MASHA ALYOKHINA: Action
is a form of political art

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:51.160
when you're doing an action.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.100
So before the
Christ, the Savior,

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:59.980
we went to the Red Square,
which is the heart of, I think,

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:03.550
political field of Russia.

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:12.030
And we came there with a
song, "Putin Pisses Himself,"

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:13.780
his pants actually.

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:18.920
I think, yes, that's
correct translation.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:25.135
And that's, I think, how the
officials knew that we exist.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.710
How you want to describe?

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:41.870
So the action usually
should be prepared.

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:45.560
So it's different
from, for example,

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.650
classical political rally.

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:54.080
So you're doing-- you should be
prepared, because you will not

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.790
have a second chance to do it.

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:59.780
I mean, you will have,
but a different place.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.000
And different place
means different contexts

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.450
and different statements.

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:09.500
So we went to the Red
Square, because we felt

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:13.460
that we need to protest there.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:18.260
Because that was a time,
of January of 2012,

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:24.320
when, before the elections,
almost all the Russia

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.480
was protesting.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.570
I think it's a little
bit similar of what's

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:32.180
going on now in
the United States.

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:42.770
Because somehow Trump became
a match for the people

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:49.020
to stand up and to
spread the word.

00:09:52.206 --> 00:09:53.580
JEFF ALBERTSON:
So that brings us

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.610
a bit forward in the story
to the "Punk Prayer."

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:58.860
So this was the action
that led to your arrest

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:03.570
and detention and the trial and,
ultimately, your imprisonment.

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.370
It took place in a
large Russian Orthodox

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:09.240
Church in central Moscow in the
Cathedral of Christ the Savior.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:13.620
So I want to interject that
I visited this place in 1989

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.260
during the Soviet period.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:19.110
Our tourist guides
took us to this site.

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:22.200
It was a swimming pool,
a large outdoor swimming

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.926
pool at the time.

00:10:23.926 --> 00:10:25.050
MASHA ALYOKHINA: It's true.

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:26.790
JEFF ALBERTSON: A
cathedral had existed

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:29.210
from the 19th
century on that site

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:32.880
but was torn down in 1931
in an anti-religious purge.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.700
And then, since the fall
of the Soviet Union,

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.330
a cathedral has been
rebuilt on the site.

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.880
But you note in your book
that the cathedral is not

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.280
actually owned by the
Russian Orthodox Church.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.113
MASHA ALYOKHINA: No.

00:10:45.113 --> 00:10:48.150
JEFF ALBERTSON: Nor is it
always used in ways that might

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:49.440
associate with the church.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.290
Could you say a
bit more about how

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:56.410
Pussy Riot selected this site
for the "Punk Prayer" action?

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:58.050
MASHA ALYOKHINA:
Yeah, it's not-- well,

00:10:58.050 --> 00:10:59.760
it's not just church.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.680
It's a huge complex--

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.300
like upper church, let's
say, and lower church.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.560
And in the upper
church, upper church

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.760
is a symbol of this
collaboration between Putin

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:17.770
and Patriarch, because Patriarch
usually during his speeches

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:20.290
there.

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:21.870
But in the lower church--

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:26.920
and both of them do
not officially, by law,

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:32.130
belong to Russian Orthodox
Church organization.

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:35.490
And there are a lot
of kind of facilities

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:38.400
there, like laundry,
shop of souvenirs,

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:44.730
car wash, and halls,
like rental halls,

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:51.480
rental rooms for parties,
where you can not only

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:59.310
have a party but rent some
Japanese technics for music

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:02.580
and invite some
musical band there.

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:08.220
And generator of, like,
heavy smoke, easy smoke.

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:11.490
There's balloons and so on.

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:20.610
And so all this list of
what you can do there,

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:23.190
you can find on the
official website.

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:25.470
And usually, if you
revere something,

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:29.710
you start to read about
this place and so on.

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:31.680
So we went to the
official website,

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.400
and we were quite surprised.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:51.750
And well, I mean, we
didn't ask any permission

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:53.680
to make a song there.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.100
But yeah, and the
song was protest.

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:13.740
I think-- let's say, it's a
big drama for our country.

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.080
Because during the
whole Soviet period,

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:20.460
Christianity was banned in
Russia, in Soviet Union.

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:26.010
And thousands of people
were killed, tortured,

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:31.080
sent to the endless prison
terms just for being Christians,

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:35.380
just for praying, for
celebrating Christmas.

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:44.390
And now we have a
situation where, I mean,

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:48.140
Christianity is
used by Chekists,

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:53.510
by the same organization
which were repressing them

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:56.520
for almost a century.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:01.800
And this is very sad.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:08.480
And I think the difference
for political art,

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:18.060
between, for example, political
activism, is not providing only

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:19.870
one right decision.

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:24.540
It's about asking
questions which are not

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:28.740
being asked before and which are
uncomfortable for government,

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:32.610
for example, or for
any authorities.

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:35.340
So that's what we did.

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:42.840
We didn't say that we know how,
for example, the church should

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.610
exist in the right way.

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:50.764
We just said that we think
that it's wrong how it is.

00:14:50.764 --> 00:14:52.930
JEFF ALBERTSON: In the days
after the "Punk Prayer,"

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:57.360
you went into hiding in
Moscow for a number of days,

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.840
and then you were arrested--

00:14:58.840 --> 00:14:59.090
MASHA ALYOKHINA: Yeah.

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:00.381
JEFF ALBERTSON: --and detained.

00:15:00.381 --> 00:15:02.190
MASHA ALYOKHINA: That
was almost a year.

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:02.700
JEFF ALBERTSON: Yes.

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:04.158
MASHA ALYOKHINA:
Because we changed

00:15:04.158 --> 00:15:09.580
flats, conspiracy flats
every day, changed phones,

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:13.500
changed SIM cards and so on.

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.990
So yeah, it's one
of my favorite part.

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:20.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.830
JEFF ALBERTSON: So your
first stop in your detention

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:25.860
was in Moscow, as
I understand it.

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:28.207
Where you spent some
months awaiting trial.

00:15:28.207 --> 00:15:29.040
MASHA ALYOKHINA: No.

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:29.831
JEFF ALBERTSON: No?

00:15:29.831 --> 00:15:30.607
Not so long?

00:15:30.607 --> 00:15:32.190
MASHA ALYOKHINA:
When they arrest you,

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:35.330
they put you to Petrovka.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:38.550
It's like the oldest prison,
oldest jail in Moscow,

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:43.000
like from the sad period
and so on, from monarchy.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:49.650
So they put you there, and
there you spend five, six days.

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:51.900
And after they put
you to the jail

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:56.900
were investigation,
court, and sentence.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:58.820
So it's about eight
months you are

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:04.160
spending in the
women's jail, which

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.350
is the only one in Moscow.

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:08.960
JEFF ALBERTSON: And you
described Petrovka as a place--

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:14.770
for example, it was so cold, and
the building was so porous that

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:18.815
the prisoners used dough
from their bread ration--

00:16:18.815 --> 00:16:19.940
MASHA ALYOKHINA: It's jail.

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:21.000
JEFF ALBERTSON: --and
sanitary napkins--

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.130
MASHA ALYOKHINA:
It's Moscow jail.

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:23.338
JEFF ALBERTSON: Moscow jail--

00:16:23.338 --> 00:16:25.430
to stuff into
cracks in the walls

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:29.540
to try to insulate
their room themselves.

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:31.100
So during this
time when you were

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.500
in detention awaiting
trial, what kind of access

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:37.260
did you have to legal
counsel, to a lawyer,

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:42.230
and also to your family
and others on the outside?

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.920
MASHA ALYOKHINA: I had
an access to lawyer.

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:52.650
But, well, I think
it's a bit different.

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:59.230
So you have visits with lawyer
in the room in another building

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:02.680
from where your cell is.

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:08.770
And of course, it's
all listened and so on.

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:16.160
So they can use any of your
talks anywhere, not only

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.069
in investigation protocols.

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:23.530
They can use it in governmental
media, for example.

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:26.650
Because all the media,
as you know, in Russia,

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:29.410
all the big media belongs
to friends of Putin.

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:34.540
So they provide
everything what they

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.255
accept from the administration
of the president.

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:44.330
And about family, to have
a visit with your family,

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:49.030
you should have a signed
paper from your investigator.

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:55.030
And our investigator, he
somehow lost about 10 papers

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:56.930
where I ask to this visit.

00:17:56.930 --> 00:18:02.620
So no visits during
the investigation.

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:04.960
After the trial,
I had one visit,

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:09.250
but it's kind of hard to see--

00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:14.921
I mean, to see your son
between this glass and so on.

00:18:14.921 --> 00:18:16.420
JEFF ALBERTSON: What was--

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:19.330
except for that visit, what
was the total amounts of time

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:22.450
you were separated
from your son?

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:25.960
MASHA ALYOKHINA: Well, I've
been in prison for two years.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.510
But when they sent
me after the sentence

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:34.270
to the penal colony, which is
3,000 kilometers to Moscow,

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:39.190
I had once at three months
visits with my family.

00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:45.280
So they came to the
penal colony to visit me.

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:48.115
JEFF ALBERTSON: So you
were charged with--

00:18:48.115 --> 00:18:51.490
in English, it
translates to hooliganism

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:53.800
motivated by religious hatred.

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.300
You recall your
reaction when you

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.291
were told that was the
charge against you?

00:18:58.291 --> 00:18:59.790
MASHA ALYOKHINA: I
don't know, yeah.

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:05.300
I was quite surprised,
because the law in Russia

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:09.820
exists in the way that if
you have just hooliganism,

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:13.510
it's not a criminal crime.

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:20.230
So you can get up
to 15 days in jail.

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:26.120
But if they find this
motivation of hatred,

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:29.730
it's up to seven years.

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:34.980
And well, this kind of
"hatred" can be different.

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:38.210
It can be political
hatred, social hatred,

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:41.240
and religious one,
which they somehow

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:46.310
found in us, in our song.

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:52.430
And that was hard to say--

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:57.650
a special part of the trial
of proving that we really

00:19:57.650 --> 00:20:03.760
hated the church, they
said, and Christianity,

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.540
which was fucking absurd.

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.140
JEFF ALBERTSON: The
prosecutors analyzed

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:13.400
the lyrics of the songs
in your performance.

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.090
MASHA ALYOKHINA:
Special experts.

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:18.490
Special experts
analyzed our song

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:25.000
and found that the phrase
holy shit means hatred

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.080
to whole Christianity.

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.680
As if you're saying
holy shit, it

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:38.710
means that you hate all
Christian believings

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:39.720
and church itself.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.356
Yes, I mean, it's
official, official.

00:20:44.356 --> 00:20:46.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.850
JEFF ALBERTSON: So the trial?

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:51.480
MASHA ALYOKHINA: As often you
repeat holy shit, it means,

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.390
like, you more and
more hate the church.

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:56.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:56.650 --> 00:21:00.469
JEFF ALBERTSON: I understand at
the conclusion of the trial--

00:21:00.469 --> 00:21:02.010
MASHA ALYOKHINA:
And there are people

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:03.410
who really believed that.

00:21:05.924 --> 00:21:08.465
JEFF ALBERTSON: They believed
the testimony of these experts?

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:14.550
So at the conclusion
of your trial,

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:16.740
you were sentenced to
two years in prison,

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:19.965
and you were transported
to a prison camp in Perm.

00:21:19.965 --> 00:21:21.340
MASHA ALYOKHINA:
Berezniki, yeah.

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:22.423
JEFF ALBERTSON: Berezniki.

00:21:22.423 --> 00:21:25.630
MASHA ALYOKHINA: It's actually
a small city in Perm region.

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:28.530
And Boris Yeltsin,
who was before Putin,

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:30.559
he was grown up in that city.

00:21:30.559 --> 00:21:31.350
JEFF ALBERTSON: Oh.

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:33.570
MASHA ALYOKHINA: Yeah,
he was study there.

00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:39.360
And he was, well, totally not
the president, as you know.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.690
JEFF ALBERTSON:
What a small world.

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:44.460
Can you tell us a bit
about the prison camp?

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:47.310
What was the environment
like for you?

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:49.050
MASHA ALYOKHINA:
In Russia, we have

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:55.860
Soviet system of Soviet prison
system or post-Soviet prison

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:56.380
system.

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:57.810
So we don't have prisons.

00:21:57.810 --> 00:22:05.760
We have penal colonies,
let's say, or labor camps.

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:08.430
So it's camp.

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:18.120
It's like a strange village
with barracks, buildings.

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:20.250
For example, two
floors building.

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:23.310
In one floor exist one unit.

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:26.370
And in one unit it's 100 people.

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:29.400
So all of them are living
together, sleeping together

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:32.250
in one bedroom, and
having, for example, three

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:34.170
toilets for everybody.

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:37.950
And it's no hot
water, no medicine,

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:41.890
which is the main problem.

00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:46.020
And it's necessary to work.

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:52.480
So all the prisoners
work in the fabric,

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:57.330
which is another part of the
zone or the penal colony.

00:22:57.330 --> 00:23:00.890
And the most cynical
thing that the work

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:08.350
is sewing police uniform and
uniform for Russian army.

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:08.850
[SIGHS]

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:15.400
Yeah, they are almost
not paid for that.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:19.320
So it's like two, three
dollars for month as a salary.

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:25.080
And usually people who have
no support from the outside

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:27.660
should somehow
decide what they will

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:31.188
buy-- cigarettes or toothpaste.

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:37.940
Well, when I came there--

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:44.340
the transportation is
another kind of story--

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:50.740
I was quite surprised, because,
well, all these women start

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:54.440
to tell me what is going on.

00:23:54.440 --> 00:24:00.900
But they didn't do
anything against it.

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:03.450
And I asked, why?

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:10.350
Why you just say that
you will not go to work?

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:13.400
And some of these people were
working for administration

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.880
as, let's say, spies.

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.860
And if you're saying
something like that,

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:26.670
it means that you're kind of
preparing of this organization

00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:29.140
of regimen.

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:32.250
And they put me into
solitary confinement

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:38.280
for two months and two months,
so almost five months in total.

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:43.020
And start to make different
kinds of pressure to me.

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:49.320
So we, together with my
lawyer and my friends,

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:52.230
decide to go to the
court against them.

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:55.050
And after two months, we won.

00:24:55.050 --> 00:25:00.690
And that was the first
court against prison guards

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:06.390
in this penal colony, and
everybody were quite surprised.

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:07.890
JEFF ALBERTSON: You
won your release

00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:09.150
from solitary confinement?

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:10.316
MASHA ALYOKHINA: No, no, no.

00:25:10.316 --> 00:25:17.440
I won a court against prison
guards, against their--

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:23.481
for example, if they find it's--

00:25:23.481 --> 00:25:23.980
OK.

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:29.750
For example, they want to
punish you inside prison,

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:31.040
so how they can do it.

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:37.720
They are finding
that you somehow

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:43.450
violated the regimen, the rules
of prison, the official law.

00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:48.460
After this finding,
they writing a paper.

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:53.290
And this paper
means that you are

00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:56.140
kind of disciplinary punished.

00:25:56.140 --> 00:26:00.730
They can, I mean, it's
a whole process there,

00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:02.440
like official one.

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.330
It's like a small
court against--

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:08.590
a small court inside the prison.

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:14.210
So they wrote a number of
these papers against me.

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:20.110
And I went to the
court to appeal.

00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:24.010
And when I won, eight
people from prison guards

00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:26.980
were fired, because
they broke a law.

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:30.380
It's them who did it.

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:37.540
And they start to kind
of improve conditions.

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:40.090
So they start to
recover barracks,

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:48.210
put up salaries,
yeah, these things.

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:49.680
JEFF ALBERTSON:
You were released

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:53.610
from your sentence a bit early.

00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:55.740
What do you think
motivated the government

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:58.710
to declare an
amnesty that impacted

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:02.670
your case at the end of 2013?

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:06.810
MASHA ALYOKHINA: It was a
month before Olympic games.

00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:13.689
So as you know, the Olympic
games, so the media and--

00:27:13.689 --> 00:27:14.730
JEFF ALBERTSON: In Sochi?

00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:17.540
MASHA ALYOKHINA: In Sochi,
yes, it came to Russia.

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:21.450
And somehow Putin,
his team decide

00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:26.020
to make good faces for
the West and released

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:31.530
us and Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who
was also political prisoner who

00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:34.920
spent 10 years in penal
colony, who used to be

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:38.310
a Russian oligarch in '90s.

00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:48.330
So they released three of us and
some other political prisoners

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:52.140
from Arctic Sunrise case.

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:52.710
I don't know.

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:57.120
Do you know it was national
for Russian ecologists

00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.155
and Greenpeace?

00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:05.530
It's another story, anyway.

00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:08.190
So they released a number
of political prisoners,

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:11.530
saying that, hi,
guys, we don't have

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:12.800
political prisoners in Russia.

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:13.690
We are OK.

00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:17.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:24.730
But we went to the Sochi
after a month, I think,

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:26.821
a month, a week.

00:28:26.821 --> 00:28:30.790
And that was another story,
because we made an action

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:35.980
there, and that was
totally another Russian

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:38.230
that we remembered.

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:41.080
JEFF ALBERTSON: You were
assaulted in Sochi at least

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:42.070
once.

00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:44.317
MASHA ALYOKHINA: Yeah,
Cossacks, Cossacks with

00:28:44.317 --> 00:28:45.660
[MAKES WHIPPING SOUND].

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:46.180
JEFF ALBERTSON: Whips.

00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:47.138
MASHA ALYOKHINA: Whips.

00:28:47.138 --> 00:28:48.086
JEFF ALBERTSON: Yeah.

00:28:48.086 --> 00:28:52.382
MASHA ALYOKHINA:
[LAUGHS] Not only them.

00:28:52.382 --> 00:28:54.340
JEFF ALBERTSON: May I
open it to some questions

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:54.690
from my colleagues?

00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:55.840
MASHA ALYOKHINA: Yeah.

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:58.570
JEFF ALBERTSON: Let me
pass around the microphone.

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:00.100
AUDIENCE: Hi, Masha.

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:04.434
So what are your main learnings
from your life and basically--

00:29:04.434 --> 00:29:05.350
MASHA ALYOKHINA: What?

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:06.599
AUDIENCE: Your main learnings?

00:29:06.599 --> 00:29:08.371
MASHA ALYOKHINA: Learnings.

00:29:08.371 --> 00:29:09.746
AUDIENCE: Is that--
did you hear?

00:29:09.746 --> 00:29:10.190
MASHA ALYOKHINA: Uh-huh.

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:10.490
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:11.406
MASHA ALYOKHINA: Yeah.

00:29:11.406 --> 00:29:13.630
AUDIENCE: So what is
the main message you

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:16.480
want to bring to this country?

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.790
MASHA ALYOKHINA: I think
every learning is important.

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:23.470
And I wrote the
book just to show

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:27.880
the one example of how it
is possible to make a choice

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:30.130
and act.

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:36.200
But I believe that history of
any country, it doesn't matter.

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.920
Russia, United
States, Great Britain

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:42.650
are made by people, not
by political leaders,

00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:44.500
but by all of us.

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:48.070
And each of us has own story.

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:50.140
And all these
stories is actually

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:52.510
a history of the country.

00:29:52.510 --> 00:30:03.800
So I know it doesn't sound
like a statement or a message.

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:06.380
But I think this is
what I want to say.

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:12.620
JEFF ALBERTSON: Next
question for Masha?

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:16.460
AUDIENCE: I'm curious,
in the sort of spectrum

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:19.670
of a different kind
of political action,

00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:23.890
from more to less radical,
through art, through marching,

00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:28.730
also different things people
can do under a regime that's

00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:31.820
oppressive, which are the most
effective to actually bring

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:33.680
about change, in your opinion?

00:30:37.577 --> 00:30:39.410
MASHA ALYOKHINA: Any
honest thing, actually.

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:53.750
I mean, we have one effective
manager, whose name was Stalin,

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:56.530
and that was quite effective.

00:30:56.530 --> 00:31:03.090
But I think brought us
to not work like that.

00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:08.750
It's about what's in your heart.

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:21.800
And, for example, I was a
studier of political art

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:25.160
or any art except poetry.

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:30.140
So I never thought that
it will happen with me.

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:31.940
Never.

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:36.200
But things are
happening sometimes.

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:42.350
So it's most important--

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:51.380
do not lose yourself and
do not afraid to speak out.

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:54.920
It doesn't matter
where it's going on.

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:59.900
Maybe it's a situation in the
class where all the students

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:01.790
are silent, and
you just stand up

00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:05.820
and say something to your
teacher that you are not agree.

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:10.880
This is totally the same than
going to the cathedral for me.

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:11.870
It's the same level.

00:32:14.899 --> 00:32:16.190
AUDIENCE: I have two questions.

00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:17.960
What brings you joy?

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:20.225
And what are your
future artistic plans?

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:39.250
MASHA ALYOKHINA: Well,
I like the reaction.

00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:43.630
I like when I am doing
something and it works.

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:46.228
And I like swim.

00:32:46.228 --> 00:32:47.685
It's different things, but--

00:32:47.685 --> 00:32:52.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:54.790
And future plans?

00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:57.850
I don't have plans.

00:32:57.850 --> 00:33:01.780
I'm usually, like,
doing what I feel.

00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:08.710
JEFF ALBERTSON: So you've been a
citizen activist and a prisoner

00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:12.100
of conscience in what most
neutral observers would

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:15.947
certainly call an
authoritarian regime.

00:33:15.947 --> 00:33:18.280
What advice would you offer
to people in other countries

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:20.770
around the world who
might be concerned

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:24.340
about creeping authoritarianism
in their own societies?

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:29.800
MASHA ALYOKHINA: Advice?

00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:37.860
Mm, I mean, when we
started Pussy Riot,

00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:43.220
we were inspired by
movements from US a lot,

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:46.990
from radicals, from [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:49.370
So it's you guys
who give us advices.

00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:59.750
So really, I think you have
an amazing culture if we're

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:02.670
speaking about freedom.

00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:05.570
I mean, United
States was created

00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:06.790
as a culture of freedom.

00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:09.199
So what do I say can give you?

00:34:09.199 --> 00:34:10.790
That's a very strange question.

00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:15.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:17.719
JEFF ALBERTSON: Thank you.

00:34:17.719 --> 00:34:21.260
So with that, we'll
come to a close.

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:23.277
Masha Alyokhina,
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]..

00:34:23.277 --> 00:34:24.735
MASHA ALYOKHINA:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

00:34:24.735 --> 00:34:25.772
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:25.772 --> 00:34:27.269
How you know Russian?

00:34:27.269 --> 00:34:29.265
JEFF ALBERTSON: At school.

00:34:29.265 --> 00:34:32.259
MASHA ALYOKHINA: Really?

00:34:32.259 --> 00:34:34.296
He was learning
Russian in school?

00:34:34.296 --> 00:34:35.420
JEFF ALBERTSON: I was, yes.

00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:36.709
MASHA ALYOKHINA: It's popular?

00:34:36.709 --> 00:34:37.500
JEFF ALBERTSON: No.

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:37.770
MASHA ALYOKHINA: No.

00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:38.615
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:38.615 --> 00:34:40.670
But why did you decide
to learn Russian?

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:42.419
JEFF ALBERTSON: Well,
it was the Cold War.

00:34:42.419 --> 00:34:43.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:44.540
MASHA ALYOKHINA: Oh.

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:45.440
Right.

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.890
JEFF ALBERTSON: It seemed
like a valuable skill.
