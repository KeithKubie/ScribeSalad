00:00:06.205 --> 00:00:07.373
  - Are you sure it's

00:00:08.574 --> 00:00:09.675

00:00:09.708 --> 00:00:10.576

00:00:18.517 --> 00:00:19.519
  - What? No.

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:20.586
  I'm not fucking her.

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.121
  I went to her house,

00:00:22.154 --> 00:00:23.423 size:88% position:44%
   I dropped of the decking,

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:25.425
she signed the invoice and then.

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:26.493
  Yeah, I fucked her.

00:00:27.593 --> 00:00:28.594
 - Jesus, Tom.

00:00:28.627 --> 00:00:29.429
  How?

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:30.396
- Well, mostly regular,

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:31.597
but she's also into doggy style.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.199
  - No, not how, like.

00:00:33.232 --> 00:00:34.367
 Tommy, her husband's a maniac.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.468
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:00:35.501 --> 00:00:36.469
  - You gotta stop
  doing this, please.

00:00:36.502 --> 00:00:37.336
 Come on. Stop.

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:38.438
 Do it for daddy, okay?

00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:39.272
  - For daddy.

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:40.173

  I've been here for 10 years.

00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:47.173

00:02:07.826 --> 00:02:09.595

00:02:09.628 --> 00:02:11.230

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:28.247
 - You didn't buy that.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.348 align:start position:0%
   - You paid for beers
   with quarters last night.

00:02:29.381 --> 00:02:30.450
  - Found it.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.519
   I stole it for us.

00:02:33.552 --> 00:02:34.587

00:02:36.255 --> 00:02:38.124 size:88% position:44%
   - Okay, well then, you're
   not gonna fucking use it.

00:02:38.157 --> 00:02:39.125
 - I'll probably still use it.

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:42.728
 - Look what I got us.

00:02:42.761 --> 00:02:43.496
  - Ten years.

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:44.430
I've been here.

00:02:44.463 --> 00:02:45.198
You know I've been working here.

00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:45.731

00:02:49.602 --> 00:02:51.371
  You guys know Gordy, right?

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:54.207 align:start size:88% position:13%

 (video plays)

00:02:57.843 --> 00:02:59.212
  - We've gotta talk.

00:03:00.546 --> 00:03:02.248
   - Hey, sweetheart.

00:03:02.281 --> 00:03:05.051
   You're gonna have
   to turn that down.

00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:06.452
- Oh, I'm sorry.

00:03:06.485 --> 00:03:08.488
 Suck my dick.

00:03:16.595 --> 00:03:17.563

00:03:17.596 --> 00:03:18.264
 End of story.

00:03:19.164 --> 00:03:20.099 size:88% position:44%
   I've got an idea.

00:03:20.132 --> 00:03:20.800
  - Calm down.

00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:22.134
  Look, I wanted to tell you.

00:03:22.167 --> 00:03:23.402 align:start size:88% position:13%
 But I knew you'd
 react like this, John.

00:03:23.435 --> 00:03:24.270
  - Like what?

00:03:24.303 --> 00:03:25.371
 Like this is bullshit?

00:03:25.404 --> 00:03:26.739 align:start size:88% position:13%
  This is my family's
  business, Russ.

00:03:26.772 --> 00:03:28.107 size:88% position:44%
   - Oh, I'm not family now?

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.709
 - No, you married in.

00:03:29.742 --> 00:03:30.576
 - Oh, come on.

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:31.410
  - That's different.

00:03:31.443 --> 00:03:32.211
  That doesn't count.

00:03:32.244 --> 00:03:33.346
- John.

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:34.046 size:88% position:44%

   dad's business.

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:34.547

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:35.414
  Yeah, yeah.

00:03:35.447 --> 00:03:36.582
 - Where's your father?

00:03:36.615 --> 00:03:37.750
 Last I've heard, he's
 having a fist fight

00:03:37.783 --> 00:03:39.185

00:03:39.218 --> 00:03:40.253

  No fucking, married
  in and dildo.

00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:57.303
  - That would never
  fit on a sweatshirt.

00:03:57.336 --> 00:03:59.138
  - Nobody would put
  in on a sweatshirt.

00:03:59.171 --> 00:04:00.273
   They wouldn't out
   it on a sweatshirt

00:04:00.306 --> 00:04:01.107
because you married in.

I've got a paintball (mumbles).

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.482
- [Russ] Who knows what
Tommy has on his penis.

00:04:09.515 --> 00:04:10.783
 Do sex all over town.

00:04:10.816 --> 00:04:12.051
  - Doing sex?

00:04:12.084 --> 00:04:12.785
   - Come on.

00:04:12.818 --> 00:04:14.153
 - What do you mean, doing sex?

00:04:14.186 --> 00:04:15.288 align:start size:88% position:13%
 You know, this is
 why you don't do sex.

00:04:15.321 --> 00:04:17.456
- Okay.

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.792 align:start position:0%
  - [Russ] That's why I nailed
  it right out of the gate.

00:04:19.825 --> 00:04:21.727

  talk to a manager.

  - Hey, I'm like an old lady

00:04:29.335 --> 00:04:30.803
and I'm in the yard or whatever.

00:04:30.836 --> 00:04:32.305
  - What's going on out there?

00:04:32.338 --> 00:04:34.473
- [Tommy] I'm mad about
your customer service.

00:04:34.506 --> 00:04:36.409
  - The lady wants to
  talk to a manager,

00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:38.411
  so I'm handling it.

00:04:39.445 --> 00:04:40.446
 How can I handle you?

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:41.080
- Okay.

00:04:41.113 --> 00:04:41.814
- What?

00:04:41.847 --> 00:04:42.715
  You don't handle, I handle.

00:04:42.748 --> 00:04:44.050
  He doesn't handle anything.

00:04:44.083 --> 00:04:45.217
   - John's been here
   for a long time.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.552
  - Because I've been
  away at university.

00:04:46.585 --> 00:04:47.720
- Are you talking about college?

00:04:47.753 --> 00:04:49.155
 Why are you saying university?

00:04:49.188 --> 00:04:50.122
  What is he, British?

00:04:50.155 --> 00:04:51.223 size:88% position:44%
   Fuck you.

00:04:51.256 --> 00:04:53.125

  a manager, asap,

00:04:53.158 --> 00:04:55.628
   or I'm going on my
   period everywhere.

00:04:55.661 --> 00:04:57.497

00:05:03.736 --> 00:05:05.538

(exciting music)

00:05:32.064 --> 00:05:33.299
- A little to the right.

   (yelling)

00:05:37.703 --> 00:05:39.805
(laughs)

00:05:39.838 --> 00:05:41.707
  - It's a new era, all right?

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.642 align:start position:0%
   It's time we start
   acting like professionals

00:05:43.675 --> 00:05:44.543
  around here.

00:05:44.576 --> 00:05:45.678
  (squealing)

00:05:45.711 --> 00:05:46.812
 - What the fuck is that noise?

00:05:46.845 --> 00:05:49.515
 - Dad, open the door!

00:05:49.548 --> 00:05:50.416
- Gordy!

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:51.417
   - Open it!

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:52.551
I can't get the handle.

00:05:52.584 --> 00:05:55.488
   My hand's sliding
   off from the paint

00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:57.757
that bruised me!

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:58.724
Open it!

00:05:58.757 --> 00:05:59.692
  - He's fine.

00:05:59.725 --> 00:06:00.693
  - Fire them!

00:06:00.726 --> 00:06:02.762
 Fire them all!

00:06:02.795 --> 00:06:03.795
