00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.820
Let's do a few examples adding
rational expressions.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:10.650
So let's say we had negative
x squared over x squared

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.460
minus 7x plus 6.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.970
And to that I want to
add plus x minus 4.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.250
So to some degree what I want to
do in this first example is

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.170
kind of our algebraic long
division or polynomial

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.710
division in reverse.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.770
I want to put this x minus
4 in the numerator with x

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.020
squared minus 7x plus 6
in the denominator.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.010
The easiest way to do that is
to just literally multiply x

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:51.080
minus 4 times x squared minus
7x plus 6 over x squared

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.480
minus 7x plus 6.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.800
I'm not changing the number,
I'm multiplying it by 1.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.540
So if we do that
what do we get?

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.180
Well we just have to multiply
this numerator right here, and

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.870
we can do that with algebraic
multiplication.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:18.730
So if we have x squared minus 7x
plus 6 times x minus 4, we

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.380
can multiply these two.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.590
6 times negative 4
is negative 24.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.550
Negative 4 times negative
7x is positive 28x.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.520
Negative 4 times x squared
is negative 4x squared.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.950
And if x times 6 is 6x, x times
negative 7x is negative

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.870
7x squared.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.800
x times x squared is
x to the third.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.000
So the new numerator is going
to be x to the third minus,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.590
this is 11x squared
plus 34x minus 24.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.960
So now I can rewrite this-- let
me copy and paste this--

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:07.200
this is going to be
equal to that.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:14.330
Plus I can rewrite this thing
now as being over a

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:21.220
denominator of x squared
minus 7x plus 6.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.950
And our numerator, x minus 4
times this thing over here, we

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:25.880
get this whole thing.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.760
We multiplied them out. x to
the third minus 11x squared

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:37.000
plus 34x minus 24.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.130
And now, since we have the exact
same denominator we can

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.840
add these two rational
expressions.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.300
So if you add them, you
literally can just say well we

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.000
have the common denominator, so
our common denominator is x

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.310
squared minus 7x plus 6.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.540
That was the whole point of
multiplying this expression

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.800
over this expression so that
we could get the common

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.740
denominator.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.170
And now we just add
the numerator.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.130
So this is going to add to the
x squared side, so you're

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.250
still going to have
an x to the third.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.940
And then negative or minus 11x
squared minus another x

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:23.120
squared is minus 12x squared
plus 34x minus 24.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.320
And we are done.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.210
Now we could have checked
whether we could have factored

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.440
this, but this just factors
into x minus 6

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.930
times x minus 1.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.480
So it really doesn't factor
with the minus 4 in any

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.850
meaningful way, so there really
isn't any further

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.170
simplification that we can
do for this problem.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.150
Hopefully you enjoyed that.
