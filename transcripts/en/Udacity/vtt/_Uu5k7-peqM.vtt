00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.350
Okay. We want to make this junction object called set time.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:04.415
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:04.415 --> 00:00:08.800
&gt;&gt; Because we want this menu to menu relationship between stages and bands.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:08.830
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.380
&gt;&gt; And cool. Okay, I'm going to go into Schema Builder. because I want to see

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.290
what we're working with now. And obviously right now we don't even have this set

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:22.360
time object, and band is related to stage. So, is it just as straightforward

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.990
as this looks? I have to delete

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.370
the existing relationship between band and stage and

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.590
then, you know, sort of create this new stuff?

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.410
&gt;&gt; Yup, just create that new object with

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.530
those relationships, and it's as simple as that.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.610
&gt;&gt; All right, let me give it a shot.
