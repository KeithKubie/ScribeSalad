00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.060
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: So I'm going to read. Let's
start with chapter one. Why not huh?

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.060
[laughter]

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:16.800
And the first line is not a lie its true sometimes
but most of the time it's not true.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.210
And I'm, I, I just feel that I should point
that out it being chapter one and I as I've

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:28.029
being reading that first line is just not
true. So, it's true for this circumstance,

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.939
so let's leave it at that. So it is true for
this but in general not true.

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.820
God bless my wife she always calms me down.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.640
[laughter]

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.120
As I'm looking through the mail this morning
she says: "You're gonna to see something you're

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.410
not going to like."

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.699
And I say: "Really what?"

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:47.031
She pauses gives me a knowing look.

00:00:47.031 --> 00:00:50.210
How's things in Santa Monica? Yeah!

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.210
[laughter]

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.120
'Cause I'm never going to forget this. Hi.
I'm never going to forget this this is the

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.399
weirdest thing ever.

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.399
[laughter]

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:59.879
Are there more than two employees? I just
 - wait.

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:00.879
[laughter]

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:01.879
&gt;&gt;Julie: Wait, wait we can't hear you.

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:02.879
Oh I can hear you.

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:03.879
&gt;&gt;Julie: We can hear you now.

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.020
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Oh hi oh I can talk to you.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.020
&gt;&gt;Julie: Hi, yes.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.930
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Can you explain what's going
on here?

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:09.930
[laughter]

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.060
Was there, was there a fire alarm of some
sort?

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.190
&gt;&gt;voice from audience: We're offended now
'cause we didn't hear it.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.030
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: There's nothing to be offended.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.030
&gt;&gt;Julie: We couldn't get connected.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.030
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Ok. So -

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.030
&gt;&gt;Julie: Now we can.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.760
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: So my question to you is there
a fire alarm of some sort or how do you explain

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.800
no one being there?

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.340
[laughter]

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.530
&gt;&gt;Julie: Well you know what, it actually has
to do with overeating because today we have

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:33.530
a brand new caterer starting in our office
and everybody's up there eating.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:34.530
[laughter]

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.330
So we're the only, and he brought his food,
I, I wanted to see you before I ate so I wouldn't

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.760
eat as much.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.760
[laughter]

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.420
So, that's how I'd explain it.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.910
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: What, what's your name?

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:51.910
[laughter]

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:52.910
&gt;&gt;Julie: Julie.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:02:00.510
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Julie. So do me a favor, Julie.
Wow. Can, can someone tell me how to get a

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.240
hold of her? 'Cause next, this Friday March
26th, I wanna invite you to my show at the

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.980
comedy store as my guest.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:08.980
[applause]

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.980
&gt;&gt;Julie: Oh thank you. That would be awesome.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:12.980
[applause]

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.650
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: You, you, you and a guest maybe
the person who is eating with you.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.740
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;voice from audience: That's Pertick.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.569
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: That's what's his name.
&gt;&gt;voice from audience: He's Pertick.

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:23.959
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Perteed. Perteed.

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:25.360
&gt;&gt;voice from audience: Pertick.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.090
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Pertick. Okay, like I'd know
the difference.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.209
&gt;&gt;Pertick: I'm an Indian guy, that's fine.

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:30.209
[laughter]

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.819
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Pertick, a pleasure, Pertick.
Pertick you can come too. So each of you can

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.410
bring someone. I'm not gonna to make you start
dating.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.410
[laughter]

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.640
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Although I know you and Pertick
have had a, a thing going on in the office.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.640
[laughter]

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.799
See here's what I know. Pertick is not all
that interested in me but he knows his getting

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.939
some good alone time with you.

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:57.069
[laughter]

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:58.069
So, so can you give me her, her information?

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:59.069
&gt;&gt;voice in audience: [unintellgible]

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.330
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Okay so I'm gonna to get your
information and my assistant will be contacting

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.040
you and you guys can come to the show this
Friday. Okay?

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.140
&gt;&gt;Julie: Oh, thanks a lot Jeff.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.230
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin]: Do what I can. Do you guys
 -

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.230
[laughter]

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.230
&gt;&gt;Jullie: Totally.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.230
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: See I'm telling you Pertick
doesn't give a crap about me.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.230
[laughter]

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.230
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Who just walked by? Somebody
walked by.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.909
&gt;&gt;voice from audience: I went to the Paley
Panel last week. I just saw you and -

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:23.700
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Oh you went to the Paley Panel
with everybody from Curb. How about that?

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.700
Okay.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.700
&gt;&gt;voice from audience: Yeah

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.700
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Good. Well thank you.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.190
[many people speaking at once]

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.329
Pertick, I think. What?

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:34.330
&gt;&gt;Petrick: I want to say just like you I do
have an issue with overeating. So this is

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.620
gonna be great, great talk for me.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.620
[laughter]

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.940
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Okay. Who was that? Who was
that? Who was that? Who are these people?

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:44.940
[laughter]

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.419
They're not eating they should be watching.
Alright.

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:49.419
[laughter]

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:53.139
Okay, so I'm going to go back to reading but
I'm getting' you guys set up for my show.

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:54.139
Okay?

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:55.170
&gt;&gt;Julie: You're awesome. Thank you.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.299
&gt;&gt;Pertick: Thank you.

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.450
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: I just get the feeling Pertick
that you're not that interested.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:00.450
[laughter]

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.809
Just my gut feeling. I just don't know why
yet.

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:03.809
[laughter]

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:09.370
Alright but for nonetheless I'm a man of my
word. Alright I'm gonna to read a couple of

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.799
things here. So, alright here we go.

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.709
God bless my wife she always calms me down.

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.489
As I'm looking through our mail this morning
she says: "You're going to see something you're

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:20.489
not gonna to like."

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.079
And I say: "Really what?"

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.080
She pauses gives me a knowing look and says:
"Just use it in your comedy."

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.370
I start thumbing through the mail. I've received
a catalog from the good people at Living XL.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.129
It's a catalog for fat people who wanna stay
fat and enjoy themselves.

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:37.129
[laughter]

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:41.729
The message is basically: don't lose weight,
no no no. All the problems that you normally

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:45.470
have with being fat we've got a solution.

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.050
How in the, how do they know to send me a
catalog? Do they have a list of fat celebrities?

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.500
I open it up. The first product on offer is
a three-wheeled bike with a 500 pound capacity.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.870
[laughter]

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.740
As I look at this contraption, I'm wondering
how many 500 pound people are sitting around

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.159
and thinking, "I so wanna go biking. I just
don't have the opportunity.

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:07.159
[laughter]

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:12.250
I weigh 450. If only there was a bike that
could hold my weight. Then I'd have no excuse."

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.990
[laughter]

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.740
[pause]

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:24.139
The pages don't turn so easy. Next up fat
ponchos. Because we know the regular poncho

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:25.139
is so slimming.

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:26.870
[laughter]

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.479
Has anyone ever put on a poncho and said:
"This is not freeing enough."

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:31.550
[laughter]

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.620
I only, I guess the only way this thought
would cross your mind is if you're a really

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.039
fat woman and you're wearing a mumu underneath
your oversized poncho.

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:39.039
[laughter]

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:44.419
Now how about one of those chairs you bring
to a kids soccer game except this one's got

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:49.340
an 800 pound capacity. How many 800 pounders
do you see out in society?

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:50.340
[laughter]

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:56.800
It must be for a 400 pounder who's got a 400
pound girlfriend who wants to sit on his lap.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:57.800
[laughter]

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:04.169
Okay, okay, okay here's a hammock with a 600
pound capacity. Now I don't care what you

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:07.350
weigh getting on and off a hammock is quite
difficult.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:08.350
[laughter]

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:14.330
I don't care if you weigh 150 hammock mobility
is hard for everyone. So you're 600 pounds.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.400
The odds of you getting on that hammock are
so slight.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.400
[laughter]

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:24.050
You're going to be on the ground; you're 600
pounds. Once you do get on you're never getting

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.050
off.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.050
[laughter]

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:31.250
Let's see here, here's one with a great name,
it's called the Pride XL Mobility Chair.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.409
I read the description and learn that when
you press a button on the chair instead having

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:40.770
to get up the chair lifts you up. And yet
they call it the pride mobility chair. I think

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:45.860
one of the first things about being a proud
person is that you can stand up on your own.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:46.860
[laughter]

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.039
I'm not talking about someone in a wheelchair
or someone who was in an accident. I'm talking

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:55.340
about when you really don't have a reason
for not being able to stand up for yourself.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.340
[laughter]

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.660
They should call it the embarrassment mobility
chair.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:06:59.810
[laughter]

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.680
Next up is something you've probably seen
in commercials. And to me this is so horrible

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:10.469
and wrong. It's the Living XL wearable sleeves
blanket. Now how many times have you covered

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:16.880
yourself in a blanket and then thought I can't
get up, I can't maneuver if only I had sleeves.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:17.880
[laughter]

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.979
It's only a matter of time before you see
someone wearing this thing at the grocery

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:25.840
store, to keep warm, while perusing the frozen
foods aisle.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:31.909
They've got toilets alright. Here's one a
toilet seat called the Big John Toilet Seat.

00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:39.270
And if you think I'm making this up, I'm not;
1200 pound capacity. Can a 1200 pound person

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:44.590
get up and go to the bathroom? Let alone sit
down and read. Twelve hundred pounds. Who's

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:46.000
taking a shit in that house?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000
[laughter]

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.680
It's described as durable and convenient.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:54.430
I understand the need for durability on this
one. But what makes it more convenient than

00:07:54.430 --> 00:08:00.560
other toilet seats? Oh, right it must be for
the 400 pound man with the 400 pound girlfriend

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:05.539
who wants to sit on his lap while he goes
number two or in this case, number five.

00:08:05.539 --> 00:08:07.439
[laughter]

00:08:07.439 --> 00:08:12.870
Here's another bottomed out contraption. The
pistol grip no bend toe nail clippers. Not

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:18.759
being able to reach your toes. That's like,
it's like this long and you can do it like

00:08:18.759 --> 00:08:19.759
that.

00:08:19.759 --> 00:08:20.759
[laughter]

00:08:20.759 --> 00:08:22.120
Not being able to reach your toes because
of the size of your belly. I'm sorry but that's

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.120
a low point.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:27.729
Maybe it's not the low point. You could be
wearing a blanket and clipping your toenails

00:08:27.729 --> 00:08:30.169
while taking a dump on the big john.

00:08:30.169 --> 00:08:31.169
[laughter]

00:08:31.169 --> 00:08:33.460
It's a low point just the same.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:37.919
But here's the moment that might be the real
bottom for me. I turn the page and look at

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:42.500
the model who's displaying the cabin comfort
inflatable pillow, and who do you think he

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:45.850
looks like? That's right he looks like me.

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:49.480
When you're going through a fat catalog and
making fun of it and you get to the last page

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:54.649
and the model is your twin; that's your low
point. It was embarrassing enough just being

00:08:54.649 --> 00:08:59.410
sent a copy in the mail but the fact that
I look like a model in Living XL renders me

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:00.850
speechless.

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:05.100
I just don't know what to say. He looks just
like me. Well I've always wanted to look like

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.130
a model but not one from a Living XL catalog.

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:14.440
So, this is my bottom. Done. I'm not messing
around anymore. I'm like the captain in Wall-E.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:19.600
If not now then when? You will see a weight
loss festival like you've never imagined.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:25.480
So this is the top of chapter one. I maybe
fail 40 or 50 more times. I think that I'm

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:32.040
going to do it but I don't. I mean eventually
I do, but boy that the thing I'm most proud

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.610
of the book is it's a book of failure.

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:34.610
[laughter]

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:39.000
And failure is funny, and its honest you know.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.200
It's about me, just so you know overall, trying
to go green and trying to lose weight. Mostly

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.350
during the production of this past seasons
of Curb Your Enthusiasm.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:55.110
By the way, the reason just so you know, that
I didn't want you guys up on the screen, I

00:09:55.110 --> 00:10:00.450
felt a change in the room when you started
seeing yourself. And one of the worst things

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:05.630
in the world is, is when you're watching yourself
while someone's trying to do something comedic.

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:10.300
And you'll be way too self-conscious if you
see, like are they laughing, do they think

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:11.300
it's funny.

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.430
So a big blue screen is fantastic.

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:14.430
[laughter]

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:18.480
This is teaching you about comedy. I want
you to leave here knowing more about comedy.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.480
[laughter]

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:24.490
Also, when you're on stage never have children
or animals up there with ya. No one will pay

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:25.720
attention to you.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.720
[laughter]

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:31.110
Okay. It's the truth. People love kids and
love animals. That's it. Done.

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:32.240
[laughter]

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:43.190
Let's see here. So I'm going to now read.
I think its page 67. Hold on. No that's not

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:47.730
what I wanna read. I wanna read back here.
Okay. I'm gonna to read to you now. As I look

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:48.990
for it, I'll tell you.

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:58.290
I decided to, to, to try and go green and
Ed Begley tries help, he helps me a lot. He's

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:02.949
pretty brilliant at it. If you think about
it his fifth choice is driving a Prius. Think

00:11:02.949 --> 00:11:06.970
about that. Fifth choice, with reservations.

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:13.190
First choice is walking, then bicycle, then
bus, then his electric car, and then if he

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:20.470
has to he feels horrible about it he'll drive
his wife's Prius. So he's in another land

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:22.550
from you and me.

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:29.680
So let me find his here. Nope. It's chapter
15. That's right I remember now.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.449
What chapter is this?

00:11:31.449 --> 00:11:36.660
So anyhow I'm gonna to tell you about riding
the bus. And know that in Los Angeles, unlike

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:45.710
San Francisco or New York or Chicago, nobody
takes the bus. Nobody. I mean I shouldn't

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:51.280
say nobody; plenty of people do, but the people
that take the bus cannot afford cars.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:58.660
That's pretty - maybe five people take it
for green reasons. And then, but mostly it's

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:02.080
people that really don't have the money for
a car.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:08.600
I know that because it's really, it's out
of the way. Like, well you'll hear as I read,

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:09.600
read about it.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:17.720
I'm not brave by taking the bus but it's extraordinarily
inconvenient; and stupid on some levels. Well

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.089
you'll hear.
Okay.

00:12:19.089 --> 00:12:20.089
[laughter]

00:12:20.089 --> 00:12:27.930
We are filming a scene at Larry David's house
in Brentwood, where Larry offers to put his

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:30.800
cousin and his daughter through college.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:35.800
Today is the day I finally start my month
long only taking the bus festival. I have

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:41.730
to leave at 7:20 am to make a 9:00 am call
time. Nonetheless, I left my house this morning

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:43.420
so crazy excited.

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:49.519
I don't like walking unless I have a destination.
So I'm happy to be bouncing to the bus.

00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:54.779
My wife was so proud of me as I walked out
the door and she also thought I was an idiot.

00:12:54.779 --> 00:13:00.089
I think that she is both proud and thinks
I'm an idiot every day but today the dichotomy

00:13:00.089 --> 00:13:01.089
is heightened.

00:13:01.089 --> 00:13:02.089
[laughter]

00:13:02.089 --> 00:13:05.699
She actually offered me a ride to the bus
stop. Very nice of her but I don't think she's

00:13:05.699 --> 00:13:06.699
quite getting it.

00:13:06.699 --> 00:13:07.699
[laughter]

00:13:07.699 --> 00:13:12.040
As I'm walking down the hill, a steep hill,
I pass a neighbor walking his dog and I say

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:18.700
to him I'm taking the bus today. As if I'm
an eight year old on his first day of school.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:19.700
[laughter]

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:21.829
Oh good for you. That's great. That's great.

00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:27.220
Now it's about a mile walk from my house to
the bus stop. About midway there's a busy

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:33.009
street with no sidewalk. So there's a level
of danger, which today only adds to the excitement.

00:13:33.009 --> 00:13:36.399
I pass my old house which isn't far from where
I live now.

00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:41.750
I used to live down the block from this Jewish
guy who actually built his own fence. I remember

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:44.131
being so impressed that a Jew would build
a fence.

00:13:44.131 --> 00:13:45.131
[laughter]

00:13:45.131 --> 00:13:49.434
I would seeing him working on it and think,
"What are you doing?" Not only did he physically

00:13:49.434 --> 00:13:53.509
not look like the type of a guy to build a
fence, but it seemed so out of character.

00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:58.430
I am not baron von religious but I follow
the credo of Jews throughout history. Which

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:03.410
is: "I have an idea to build a fence; hey
I'll pay somebody to build my fence.

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:04.410
[laughter]

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:07.430
Whatever the price, I'll be happy to pay it.
I'll pay them and I'll probably serve them

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:08.819
lunch."

00:14:08.819 --> 00:14:13.970
But this Jew actually built his own fence.
As I passed by it, on my way to the bus stop,

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:19.380
I notice that flowers and vines have grown
all over it, and it occurs to me that I have

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:24.000
driven by that fence many times in the years
since I've lived here and never once noticed

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.839
the flowering vines.

00:14:25.839 --> 00:14:31.750
Just as healthy eating retained, retrained
my taste buds to appreciate a low sodium diet.

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:35.630
Maybe this walking business will teach me
to appreciate nature without Blue Ray.

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:36.920
[laughter]

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:37.920
When I get to the bus stop.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:38.920
Thank you.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:39.920
[laughter]

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:40.920
When I get to the, I thought that was a good
line.

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:45.770
When I get to the bus stop there's about 40
people waiting at 7:45 in the morning. I take

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:47.860
out my iPhone to call my wife and tell her
that I made it.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:54.280
By the way, at this point, not many people
had iPhones. That's why I was conscience about

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.150
taking it out; I didn't want to show off.

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:58.319
[laughter]

00:14:58.319 --> 00:15:00.730
Should I call it a Google phone just for the
rest of the story?

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:01.730
[laughter]

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:06.980
She was a bit nervous because the part of
the walk where there is no sidewalk and the

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:08.670
trucks, trucks come flying by.

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:13.040
Remember that I considered getting a bicycle
to ride to the bus after Ed told me that you

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:16.910
could put your bike on the front. But my family
voted that I'm not allowed to ride a bike

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:21.220
to the bus; or for that matter anywhere in
this city. They think I'll hurt myself.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:22.370
[laughter]

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:25.889
So I call my wife and while I'm talkin' to
her I realize that nobody around me has an

00:15:25.889 --> 00:15:30.470
iPhone. In fact, there is not one person at
the bus stop who wouldn't be driving if they

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:35.570
had a car. I'm certainly the only idiot doing
if for my carbon footprint, and I'm worry,

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:40.269
and I worry that I'm calling attention to
myself by talking on my iPhone, so I end the

00:15:40.269 --> 00:15:41.480
call quickly and put it away.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:45.529
If I'm going to be taking the bus with these
people for the next month I don't want them

00:15:45.529 --> 00:15:47.940
thinking that the new guy with an iPhone is
a douche bag.

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:49.590
[laughter]

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:54.970
At this point the bus pulls up and all these
people get on. I'm talking about every single

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:58.560
one of them. Which makes me nervous because
I don't think it's the right number bus for

00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.560
me.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:03.959
As a matter of pride I'm not going to ask
anyone. I wanna do it myself.

00:16:03.959 --> 00:16:08.980
As the doors close, I'm standin' there alone
anxiously wondering if I missed my bus, when

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:13.779
another one with the right number pulls up.
I get on and show my pass. This is all very

00:16:13.779 --> 00:16:14.779
exciting.

00:16:14.779 --> 00:16:15.779
[laughter]

00:16:15.779 --> 00:16:19.220
Now, I had thought that taking the bus would
be relaxing; that I would read or perhaps

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:24.410
pull out my notebook; jot down some notes.
But I have a long ride until I have to change

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:27.540
busses; plenty of times, plenty of time to
relax.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:33.290
Turns out it is packed; hugely packed. There's
no place to sit. I stand for about 10 minutes

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:37.620
until someone gets off right behind me and
I can finally sit down. But the only available

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:44.149
seat is a priority seat for someone who is
older, handicapped or pregnant.

00:16:44.149 --> 00:16:48.199
So from that moment on I'm sitting there stressed
thinking if somebody old or pregnant or wheelchair

00:16:48.199 --> 00:16:49.589
bound gets on I'm screwed.

00:16:49.589 --> 00:16:50.589
[laughter]

00:16:50.589 --> 00:16:54.490
I peer out the window as we approach each
stop praying that everyone waiting is young,

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:55.490
male and healthy.

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:56.490
[laughter]

00:16:56.490 --> 00:17:01.399
Meanwhile, I'm sitting across from a woman
who looks like an angry librarian and she's

00:17:01.399 --> 00:17:06.160
staring at me with the greatest distain. I
wonder if she's thinking: "Why are you here;

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:10.850
you have a car. Why are you on the bus? What
are you trying to prove? I have to be here;

00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:12.319
what's your excuse?"

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:16.100
She keeps clearing her throat and I'm convinced
that she waiting for me to take the hint and

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:21.410
relinquish my priority seat. But I'm terrified
of having to stand again. I have a horrible

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:26.850
back and the sure way to aggravate it is to
stand for long periods of time.

00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:31.401
I don't dare speak nor do I feel I can do
anything else. I don't know why I am feeling

00:17:31.401 --> 00:17:35.110
so intimidated. But for whatever reason I'm
afraid to do anything.

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:39.159
It's a little hot on the bus. But I'm afraid
to take off my jacket. I don't want to pull

00:17:39.159 --> 00:17:44.190
out my iPhone and listen to songs. I just
wanna remain as innocuous as possible.

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:49.690
I'm afraid to fall asleep. There's no music,
no talking. The bus is completely silent.

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:52.039
You can hear everyone breathing.

00:17:52.039 --> 00:17:56.330
Toward the end of the ride a woman gets on.
Under normal circumstances I would get up

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:58.160
for a woman, but not today.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.160
[laughter]

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:04.210
At least she's young, probably in her 30's.
And after all the anticipation it's an awkward

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:08.510
long bus ride. I'm waiting in Westwood for
my second bus.

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:11.410
Westwood, you hear that Santa Monica? Nearby.

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:12.410
[laughter]

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:14.022
Is someone new there? Hold on one second.

00:18:14.022 --> 00:18:15.022
[laughter]

00:18:15.022 --> 00:18:16.022
Who else? Hi.

00:18:16.022 --> 00:18:17.022
&gt;&gt;female voice in audience: Hi

00:18:17.022 --> 00:18:19.560
&gt;&gt;male voice in audience: Hi

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:23.120
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Who are you guys?

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.490
&gt;&gt;female voice in audience: There's four of
us now.

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:25.490
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garline: Who are you guys?

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:26.490
[pause]

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:27.490
Who are you?

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:28.490
&gt;&gt;male voice in audience: Introduce yourselves.

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:29.490
&gt;&gt;male voice in audience: Oh, I'm Chris.

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:30.490
[laughter]

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:31.490
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Hi Chris.

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:32.490
&gt;&gt;female voice in audience: I'm Joan.

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:33.490
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: You're Jill or June?

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:34.610
&gt;&gt;female voice in audience: Joan. [laughs]

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:37.170
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Joan, Joan?

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:38.170
&gt;&gt;Joan: Yeah, that's

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:39.170
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Okay.

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:40.170
&gt;&gt;Joan: Yep.

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:42.140
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Were you guys eating is that
why you were late?

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:43.140
[laughter]

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:44.812
&gt;&gt;male voice in audience: Yeah, a new caterer.

00:18:44.812 --> 00:18:45.812
[laughter]

00:18:45.812 --> 00:18:46.812
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: I heard. Very exciting. Very
exciting.

00:18:46.812 --> 00:18:47.812
I can understand -

00:18:47.812 --> 00:18:51.580
&gt;&gt;male voice in audience: It really is.

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:57.140
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: I can understand. So there's
a lot of eating disorder stuff going on at

00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:02.360
Google in Santa Monica; where food takes a
priority of a mentally talented handsome man.

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:03.390
[laughter]

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:06.790
&gt;&gt;male voice in audience: Sorry
&gt;&gt;female voice in audience: We might need

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:07.790
you to come visit -

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:09.440
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Alright let me finish the bus
story.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.440
&gt;&gt;female voice in audience: and mentor.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.480
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Are you enjoying the bus story
so far?

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.480
&gt;&gt;male voice in audience: Yes

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.480
&gt;&gt;female voice in audience: Very much.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:14.480
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Good.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:15.480
&gt;&gt;male voice in audience: We've never been
on the bus.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.260
&gt;&gt;female voice in audience: I have. [laughs]

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:22.850
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: By the way back me on this;
it's pretty crazy where we live to be on the

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:23.850
bus, isn't it?

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:28.060
&gt;&gt;male voice in audience: Yeah, I've never
done on it. I've always been afraid. I have

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:31.340
no idea where the buses go or, or you know
what the bus people would be like.

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:33.390
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: That's exactly right. You could
be actually taken to another land.

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:34.390
[laughter]

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:35.390
Alright –

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:36.390
&gt;&gt;male voice in audience: Yeah.

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:39.390
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: I'm going back to reading.
A pleasure all of you. If you other two had

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:41.501
gotten there earlier you get free tickets
to my show.

00:19:41.501 --> 00:19:42.920
[laughter]

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:50.180
But I'm afraid that's not going to happen
for ya.

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:51.180
[laughter]

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:52.180
&gt;&gt;male voice in audience: Too bad.

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:53.630
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Sorry. But please come. Twenty
dollars only, that's it. You know; but sorry

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:54.630
no free ones.

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:55.630
[laughter]

00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:57.039
Alright here we go.

00:19:57.039 --> 00:19:58.039
[laughter]

00:19:58.039 --> 00:20:05.770
But I hope you enjoyed the car, I hope the
caterer was worth it.

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:06.770
[laughter]

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:07.770
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Okay, here we go.

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:11.010
I'm waiting in Westwood for my second bus;
again worried about catching the right one.

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:15.740
Two buses show up and whoosh fifty people
get on, same as this morning. Behind them

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:19.390
my bus Santa Monica 3 pulls up. Santa Monica
3!

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:20.390
[laughter]

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:24.520
There it is. I'm walking up to the door and
boom it pulls off. What?

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:30.130
People inside stare at me blankly as the driver
takes off. Bus drivers never make eye contact.

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:34.360
That must be the first rule of bus driving
school. If someone's running to the bus don't

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.370
make eye contact.

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:36.370
[laughter]

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:37.960
Don't let them know you see them.

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:42.630
Ten to 15 more minutes go by and a couple
of buses pull up at the same time. I watch

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:47.700
as a girl gets off the second bus and runs
to catch the first one. But the driver closes

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.760
the door on her and takes off.

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:54.840
Then my bus comes around and it doesn't even
hesitate long enough to stop. This girl is

00:20:54.840 --> 00:21:00.640
furious. I'm furious. We're both furious together.
The bus driver who originally dropped her

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:04.690
off saw the whole thing and actually yells
out, "You should report it."

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:09.840
I take out my space pen and a notepad and
write down the number to call with complaints.

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:13.429
My first bus day and I'm making complaints.

00:21:13.429 --> 00:21:14.429
[laughter]

00:21:14.429 --> 00:21:17.909
After another five minutes the girl gets her
bus, but ten minutes pass and mines still

00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:22.909
not coming. I'm tempted to, to call a producer
of Curb and have them send a van to pick me

00:21:22.909 --> 00:21:27.590
up. But I think, "No." No matter how late
I get there, I have to stick with my mission.

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:32.500
I decided to walk down to the corner, there's
another bus stop there. I look up at the sign

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:37.070
and see my bus number. I wasn't standing at
the right stop. I laugh.

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:41.179
Finally I get on the bus to Brentwood and
I realize that my whole commute today, commute

00:21:41.179 --> 00:21:45.630
today; a commute that would normally take
me with traffic maybe 40 minutes takes me

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:47.269
two and a half hours.

00:21:47.269 --> 00:21:51.390
The bus drops me off about a half mile away
from the set and one of the transportation

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:57.670
guys at Curb Your Enthusiasm sees me walking
and is clearly confused. "I left a space open

00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:01.440
for you. You don't have to park over there."
He's referring to my usual parking space by

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:06.290
my trailer thinking that I'm walking from
where I've parked my car. "No I took the bus."

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:12.330
"Oh," he says not sure what to make of this
information. He considers me for a moment

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:15.270
and then add, adds helpfully, "I took a train
once."

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:16.270
[laughter]

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:22.909
When I finally get to the set everybody is
so impressed. They really feel like I've accomplished

00:22:22.909 --> 00:22:27.810
somethin'. Some people travel that far by
bus everyday for work. I'm so lucky to have

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:28.810
a car.

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:33.130
And I have to say Larry David just kept on
saying to me: "You really took the bus. No

00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:35.529
you really took it."

00:22:35.529 --> 00:22:36.529
[laughter]

00:22:36.529 --> 00:22:40.159
"Wow you're a better man than I, wow."

00:22:40.159 --> 00:22:41.159
[laughter]

00:22:41.159 --> 00:22:47.740
So, what I'd like to do now is, is answer
any questions that you have or you my Santa

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:48.740
Monica friends.

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:53.150
Actually the two early ones not the late ones.
But no whatever it doesn't matter.

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:55.460
But Jessie are you starting things off?

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.600
&gt;&gt;Jessie: Yeah I'll start things off. Please,
again make sure to use the mic.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.950
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Doesn't the first person get
a t-shirts? Are you cheating?

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:04.710
&gt;&gt;Jessie: I, I, I, I made sure I said anybody
who wants it. So although it's a very fine

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:06.860
t-shirt nothing wrong with t-shirt, I'll of
course give it up to the person who wants

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:07.860
it.

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:11.240
In Santa Monica you guys can just Ping me
as you have questions and I'll make sure that,

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.270
to stop the SFQ.

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:17.650
So, yeah, I will start it off by just saying
you mentioned that this book especially starts

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:21.970
off as a book of failures and I think I've
heard you say somewhere that it was very distinct

00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:25.510
from someone who's teaching how to go on a
diet, who looks like they're, they're already

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:26.510
done with it -

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:27.510
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Right.

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:29.430
&gt;&gt;Jessie: and I wonder what kind of response
you've gotten from people about talking about

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:30.690
so many failures [unintelligible]?

00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:36.830
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: [unintelligible] Okay, few
thoughts. I would never write a how to book.

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:42.610
Even about comedy. I mean I know what works
for me and, and certain comedians that I,

00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:47.340
I work with and I work with Dennis Leary and
Jon Stewart developing their HBO specials,

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:53.300
and write and produce stuff. And so in that
area which is my expertise I can work professionally,

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:54.909
but I'd never write a book about it.

00:23:54.909 --> 00:24:00.179
I would never write a book about how I lost
weight and so can you. You know I just I'm

00:24:00.179 --> 00:24:03.299
going green here's how you can. I just don't
like that.

00:24:03.299 --> 00:24:07.900
However, what's really funny is on Amazon.com
I've been stupid enough to read my reviews;

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:13.669
the first ten reviews. And some very nice
reviews, but there's some really angry reviews,

00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:18.690
because it's not a good enough how to book.
You know? He doesn't explain what diet.

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:22.640
It just was like that's not what the book
is, but yet I get penalized and my numbers

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:31.140
go down. But nonetheless, I am not on a diet.
I am not Mr. Green either. I am conscious

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:32.399
of being green.

00:24:32.399 --> 00:24:39.510
And I am, I've changed the way I eat completely.
I haven't had sugar in over a year. I haven't

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:43.510
had fast food in over a year. And I'm really
comfortable with saying I will never have

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:44.700
sugar again.

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:49.690
I have bananas and oranges and what have you.
But I'm talking about sweets. No sugar for

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:53.240
me; done. And I'm good with that. I'm totally
comfortable with that.

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:59.659
And so there is no goal. My goal is only to
be healthy, and happy, and functioning in

00:24:59.659 --> 00:25:05.240
the world. And as long as my clothes keep
getting bigger on me, and I'm exercising and

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:08.810
eating the way I want, I don't need to know
how much I weigh. I don't need to know any

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:11.190
of it. I'm just a,just changed that's all.

00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:13.830
I do Pilates. Figure that out.

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:14.830
[laughter]

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:18.540
Which is, I hate it with a passion but it's
the greatest thing ever. It, it's, you get

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:21.080
the most results with Pilates. It's pretty
amazing.

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:27.270
So the response though people who get the
book are digging it you know, but there's

00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:28.340
always stupid people.

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:29.340
[laughter]

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:34.559
But you know what the thing that blows my
mind though is these negative reviews on Amazon,

00:25:34.559 --> 00:25:38.529
vitriol? Is that the right word? Crazy. Like,
like they hate me.

00:25:38.529 --> 00:25:39.529
[laughter]

00:25:39.529 --> 00:25:42.669
Like they couldn't wait for me to release
a book to write this review.

00:25:42.669 --> 00:25:48.390
One person I even went to their other reviews.
They only wrote the review of my book and

00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:52.409
their name is not Jeff Garlin. That's somebody
who hates me.

00:25:52.409 --> 00:25:53.559
[laughter]

00:25:53.559 --> 00:25:54.720
Wow.

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:58.350
Alright but I'm, but I'm good with it and
I'm going to stop reading reviews.

00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:02.460
But people who have read the book, that I,
approached me and said nice things. I hope

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:03.460
you dig it.

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:10.360
So, alright next question. Who wants a t-shirt?
Oh here we go. Look at that my friend.

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:11.700
&gt;&gt;male voice in audience: Hey, Jeff thanks
very much for coming. I look forward to -

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:12.700
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: My pleasure.

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:13.700
&gt;&gt;male voice in audience: [unintelligible]
on the shirt.

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:14.929
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: And is it a Google T-shirt?

00:26:14.929 --> 00:26:16.399
&gt;&gt;female voice in audience: It's right there.

00:26:16.399 --> 00:26:17.399
[various voices speaking at once]

00:26:17.399 --> 00:26:26.350
&gt;&gt;male voice in audience: To your right.
&gt;&gt;male voice in audience: To your right, right.

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:28.929
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Oh, hanging here. I didn't
know they made these.

00:26:28.929 --> 00:26:29.929
[laughter]

00:26:29.929 --> 00:26:31.480
Can you imagine me walking down the street
wearing this?

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:32.480
[laughter]

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:33.480
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Hi, how are you?

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.480
[laughter]

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:37.740
Hello. So here, come, come, so here give this
to him. Hand that to him. See it's not going

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:42.020
to be weird you wearing it. But wow, that'd
be weird.

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:47.190
Like every year they give us Curb Your Enthusiasm
stuff. Like jackets and shirts and stuff.

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:50.670
I'm not gonna walk around with a big Curb
Your Enthusiasm. I'd feel like the biggest

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:51.670
douche on earth.

00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:54.210
Okay, ask your question.

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:55.210
[laughter]

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:56.210
What's your question man?

00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:59.020
&gt;&gt;male voice in audience: I just wanted hear
how it was taking these steps to be more green

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:03.840
and better eating habits with comedians like
Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld around you

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:04.840
all the time?

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:09.000
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: [unintelligible] I have a,
everybody was very supportive; I, I refer

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:15.919
to, how did I refer to Jerry in the book?
He's, what do I call him Allison?

00:27:15.919 --> 00:27:16.919
&gt;&gt;Allison: Sadistic.

00:27:16.919 --> 00:27:19.429
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Sadistic, yes. That's my assistant
Allison. I refer to him as sadistic.

00:27:19.429 --> 00:27:23.980
He, Jerry wants me to lose weight but he took
the approach that most comedians would take

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:28.539
and he would say things to me like: "Hey Garland
if you could have anything you want for dinner

00:27:28.539 --> 00:27:32.020
tonight what would it be?"
And I'd say "Cheeseburger and chocolate milk,

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:34.150
chocolate milkshake."
He'd go, "That's what I'm getting."

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:35.150
[laugter]

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:38.990
And he would I'd be at dinner with him. And
he's day "I told you I was ordering this."

00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:45.539
You know. But he's a great guy and he's, and
Larry David by the way eats very healthy and

00:27:45.539 --> 00:27:50.799
has, besides maybe my mom and my wife he wants
me to lose weight more than anyone. He's really

00:27:50.799 --> 00:27:55.659
into it so; very supportive. Everyone around
me is very supportive.

00:27:55.659 --> 00:28:01.710
And then for me the hardest part was withdrawal
from sugar. Took like, it was like three weeks

00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:07.820
of hell, it really was. I might as well have
been doing heroin, coming down because - probably

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:11.760
heroin would be easier you know? Cause they
don't add heroin to foods.

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:12.760
[laughter]

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:18.520
So I wouldn't be having it, I wouldn't be
looking at how many grams of heroin are in

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:19.520
my Raisin Bran.

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.240
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice in audience: [unintelligible]

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:25.040
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Yeah, so that was difficult
'cause I didn't sleep for like two three days

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:33.220
at a time, numerous times. Had horrible headaches,
nauseous, weak, tired. It was hard, yeah.

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:36.470
And feelings came up that I wasn't so fond
of.

00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:37.470
[laughter]

00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:44.900
Alright. So next up. See, I love that you
guys are doing it. That's so funny and you're

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:46.010
havin' fun. Please ask me questions.

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:47.169
&gt;&gt;male voice in audience: We're plants.

00:28:47.169 --> 00:28:51.169
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Anything you can't be stupid.
Think of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Self-Reliance.

00:28:51.169 --> 00:28:52.169
Come on.

00:28:52.169 --> 00:28:56.419
&gt;&gt;male voice in audience: On, on that note
Ralph Waldo Emerson on the book cover and

00:28:56.419 --> 00:29:00.890
those two don't have the book or those on
YouTube. On the back you are leaning against

00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:07.350
a tree looking a bit winded and there seems
to be a either small marmot or groundhog that

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:09.840
is wearing headphones plugged into a tree
listening to Enya.

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:10.840
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Yes

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:12.880
&gt;&gt;male voice in audience: And I was just wondering
if you could explain the significance.

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:13.971
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Don't want to.

00:29:13.971 --> 00:29:15.059
&gt;&gt;male voice in audience: Okay.

00:29:15.059 --> 00:29:16.059
[laughter]

00:29:16.059 --> 00:29:19.690
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: I wanna keep it a mystery and
let people guess as to what's going on. There's

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:25.060
a video on my website that actually has the
character in it that will explain it further

00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:31.850
 @ jeffgarlin.com. And it's there, it's there.
Yeah. And, yeah.

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:36.670
What is the clicking I'm hearing? What are
you, what's go, alright I was confused, okay.

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:39.090
[laughter]
Here at Google, by the way you, for those

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:41.280
of you on YouTube, here at Google it's not
so organized.

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:42.280
[laughter]

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:47.380
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: It's not. Oh, I've been waiting
for you. Come on up.

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:51.201
&gt;&gt;female voice in audience: Well I'm only
half way through your book but I noticed -

00:29:51.201 --> 00:29:52.201
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: You're halfway through my book?

00:29:52.201 --> 00:29:53.201
&gt;&gt;female voice in audience: Yeah.

00:29:53.201 --> 00:29:54.201
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Did you start today?

00:29:54.201 --> 00:29:56.150
&gt;&gt;female voice in audience: No.

00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:57.250
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: That's wild. Go ahead, okay
go ahead.

00:29:57.250 --> 00:30:01.020
&gt;&gt;female voice in audience: I noticed, I,
I just read the part where you went to your

00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:02.269
friend's house who showed you how green he
was.

00:30:02.269 --> 00:30:03.269
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Vaguely

00:30:03.269 --> 00:30:05.180
&gt;&gt;female voice in audience: Yeah, and you
were complaining that your wife probably wouldn't

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:06.180
let you do that.

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:07.180
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Yes.

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:08.760
&gt;&gt;female voice in audience: I wanted to know
maybe how that, how it ends or how -

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:15.300
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: My wife never lets me do any,
well actually all through the book are fights

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:18.370
with my wife. Some of which I recorded and
transcribed.

00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:19.370
[laughter]

00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:24.470
Because she's not against being green, but
she's against the inconvenience of it and

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:27.169
the aesthetics of it.

00:30:27.169 --> 00:30:34.659
Sometimes green is not so atheistic and it
is always inconvenient. Always inconvenient.

00:30:34.659 --> 00:30:40.510
Really I've chosen to live now by paying attention
to what I eat and exercising and being green;

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:47.270
I've chosen an inconvenient life. My life
is not remotely convenient anymore. Yeah,

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:48.611
there's nothing convenient about it.

00:30:48.611 --> 00:30:49.611
[laughter]

00:30:49.611 --> 00:30:50.611
So -

00:30:50.611 --> 00:30:51.611
[laughter]

00:30:51.611 --> 00:30:52.611
&gt;&gt;female voice in audience: Okay.

00:30:52.611 --> 00:30:56.700
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: So, it's all through the book
we fight and I, I don't wanna spoil the ending,

00:30:56.700 --> 00:31:03.659
but yeah she wins always. I'm married that's
what, how it works. I wanna stay married.

00:31:03.659 --> 00:31:06.769
It's not about winning and losing it's about
she winning.

00:31:06.769 --> 00:31:07.769
[laughter]

00:31:07.769 --> 00:31:08.769
She's winning.

00:31:08.769 --> 00:31:09.769
Ok, anyone else?

00:31:09.769 --> 00:31:12.960
[pause]

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:14.120
I want you guys to wrestle.

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:15.120
[laughter]

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:16.120
No.

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:17.670
&gt;&gt;male voice in audience: Well, I got here
first so.

00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:18.670
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Yes.

00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:22.200
&gt;&gt;male voice in audience: I was interested
you know why going green and losing weight

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:25.820
specifically? Were there life changing events
that like brought them to your attention?

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:27.850
Why not saving the whales or something like
that?

00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:32.899
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Well, the answer. Why not saving
the whales? I've had no contact, I'm pro,

00:31:32.899 --> 00:31:34.049
I love whales and -

00:31:34.049 --> 00:31:35.049
&gt;&gt;male voice in audience: Me too.

00:31:35.049 --> 00:31:38.200
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: I'm happy they shut down that
sushi restaurant that was serv, serving whale

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:40.950
meat. Love sushi; don't want the whale meat.

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:43.029
[laughter]

00:31:43.029 --> 00:31:49.539
So, a couple things: first off, just know
that in my past, I talk about this in the

00:31:49.539 --> 00:31:56.510
book, I have Type II diabetes. I had a stroke
in 2000. After I had diabetes and the stroke

00:31:56.510 --> 00:32:01.880
I ballooned up to 320, which is not what you're
supposed to do after you have life changing

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:02.890
things.

00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:09.549
But it was the movie Wall-E that sort of,
'cause I've been asked to write books before.

00:32:09.549 --> 00:32:15.000
Do I have any ideas and I'm like, "I don't
wanna just write a book of nothing, I want

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.610
it to be about something."

00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:21.480
And I came out of the last time I saw it,
it was at the El Capitan Theater in Hollywood,

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:26.960
and it was literally the last screening before
it closed. I was in the late show.

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:30.919
And I remember being out on the street with
my wife and I'm like: "I have the idea for

00:32:30.919 --> 00:32:33.220
a book! I have an idea for a book!" And she
said: "What?"

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:38.950
I said: "I'll be like the captain who has
to get his health under control, and go green

00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:43.160
'cause their coming back to earth and it's
not so green. And I'll be like him and I'll

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:48.210
write about it. And I'll call it my footprint."
I had the title right from the get go.

00:32:48.210 --> 00:32:53.600
I thought it would happen much quicker, but
as I started writing the book I began to gain

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:59.820
weight from the stress of producing a TV show,
being a father, a husband, where I had script

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:04.490
deadline for something and - so all the stress,
I began - and then when I read, read what

00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:09.880
I was writing about, I realized, "Oh I'm screwy.
I got to fix this." And that's what changed

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:10.970
everything in me, reading it.

00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:15.639
&gt;&gt;male voice in audience: Thank you very much.

00:33:15.639 --> 00:33:16.639
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Thank you.

00:33:16.639 --> 00:33:17.639
[pause]

00:33:17.639 --> 00:33:18.639
&gt;&gt;male voice in audience: Hey Jeff, thanks
for comin'.

00:33:18.639 --> 00:33:19.639
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Hey, my pleasure, my friend.

00:33:19.639 --> 00:33:24.470
&gt;male voice in audience: I wanted your take
on public transit and why cities I guess in

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:30.799
particular L.A. is so bad, I mean everyone,
I've never lived there but everyone complains

00:33:30.799 --> 00:33:31.889
about the traffic -

00:33:31.889 --> 00:33:34.091
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Yeah the traffic's terrible
and public transportation.

00:33:34.091 --> 00:33:35.091
&gt;&gt;male voice in audience: So what are the,
yeah so what are the -

00:33:35.091 --> 00:33:40.080
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: I almost feel that the public
transportation in L.A. is random. Meaning

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:43.960
like, yes put a bus line over there, sure.

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:49.820
There's never any thought to we should build
one down Olympic downtown or, it's just seems

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:53.649
like no, is just seems like whenever there's
probably a new mayor or something somebody

00:33:53.649 --> 00:33:57.200
new gets there, "Yeah, let's do that." It
just seems random.

00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:02.630
And, and it's kind of expensive to ride. I
was shocked at how much the monthly pass cost,

00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:06.620
you know? It was all I don't know. I don't
wanna,

00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:11.960
I've committed, by the way, when I am home
in L.A. and I go to my office one day a week

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:13.061
I'm still gonna to take the bus.

00:34:13.061 --> 00:34:17.630
Cause I figure that that's like a cool thing
that maybe if people hear about that they'll

00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:22.610
want to do the same thing. One day I won't
take a car. And maybe they should make everybody,

00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:28.350
no they shouldn't do that. I, I don't want
anyone being made to do anything, but to really

00:34:28.350 --> 00:34:29.481
answer your question, I don't have a clue.

00:34:29.481 --> 00:34:31.130
[laughter]

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:35.210
And I've asked Ed Bagley about it who takes
the bus quite often. He doesn't have a clue

00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:36.640
either. So it's not like I'm an expert and
I know anything.

00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:41.400
&gt;&gt;male voice in audience: So I guess with
all of the star power and the causes that

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:46.180
folks have and the eco-consciousness of seemingly
a lot of celebrities -

00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:47.180
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Yes

00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:50.690
&gt;&gt;male voice in audience: you don't see many
people standing out for the cause of improved

00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:51.840
public transportation?

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:56.760
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Alright, can you see Paris
Hilton, Tom Hanks waiting for a bus?

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:58.310
[laughter]

00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:59.651
Seriously, can you?

00:34:59.651 --> 00:35:00.651
&gt;&gt;male voice in audience: No.

00:35:00.651 --> 00:35:03.750
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: And they're so famous. See
when I rode the bus nobody recognized me,

00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:08.700
I have a good level of fame. Which is, if
you know who I am your very pleased and excited,

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:10.650
and then if you don't I'm just a guy.

00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:11.650
[laughter]

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:15.330
It's not like you saw me on Hollywood Squares
or something, you know?

00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:16.330
[laughter]

00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:20.980
I'm famous for some level of accomplishment
as opposed to fame for fame's sake.

00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:27.940
And so you're not gonna to get, I, I just
don't think there, there are a lot of celebrities,

00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:34.071
smaller than me sure who should but you know.
That's, yeah, I don't think it's gonna to

00:35:34.071 --> 00:35:35.180
work. It's too bad.

00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:37.140
Alright but you know, hey I take the train
in New York. And it's so funny I'll be on

00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:44.670
the train and people will go: "What are you
doin' here?" As if I got a limo following

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:50.310
me above ground wherever I go. I could be
on the limo but I've chosen you know?

00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:51.310
[laughter]

00:35:51.310 --> 00:35:55.700
Yeah, yeah, I, I wish it was better, but I
don't have the answer.

00:35:55.700 --> 00:36:00.830
I'll answer questions about Curb. I'll answer
questions about anything. I don't care, Old

00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:02.000
West Collectibles.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000
[pause]

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.130
&gt;&gt;male voice in audience: No, please take
the mic.

00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:06.700
&gt;&gt;female voice in audience: Sorry.

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:09.200
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Did you really offer to let
him go first?

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:11.900
&gt;&gt;female voice in audience: I did.

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:12.900
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: OK.

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:13.900
[laughter]

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:16.030
Do you know that yesterday I spoke, over here
at San Francisco at a bookstore and a woman

00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:18.831
in the audience told a story, after I talked
about the bus, she goes, "I wanna tell you

00:36:18.831 --> 00:36:23.130
this story." And she told me a story about
robbing a seven-year old to get a bus fare.

00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:24.130
[laughter]

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:29.080
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: I don't, whatever. I just felt
rather strange in why she shared that. So

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:30.411
please don't share something like that.

00:36:30.411 --> 00:36:31.411
[laughter]

00:36:31.411 --> 00:36:32.411
Hi, go ahead.

00:36:32.411 --> 00:36:35.160
&gt;&gt;female voice in audience: Talking about
bookstores, when you look for your book at

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:36.160
a bookstore –

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.160
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Um-hum.

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:38.160
&gt;&gt;female voice audience: it's in the comedy
section?

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:42.090
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: I know it's in the comedy section,
it's, it's in different sections. It's, unless

00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:47.690
it's on the front table it's - here's the
thing it's not a best seller. Some stores,

00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:52.670
when the person who decides likes me, when
someone likes me put it out in the front.

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:56.540
Or there's a lot of 'em you know in different
sections. And then other stores when they

00:36:56.540 --> 00:37:01.630
don't know who I am, which is more people
than not, they're like, "Oh comedy." So there's

00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:02.750
no what can you do?

00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:05.810
&gt;&gt;female voice in audience: So yeah that was
basically my question. Where would you, where

00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:06.810
would you ideally place your book –

00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:07.810
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Where would I place my book?

00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:08.810
&gt;&gt;female voice in audience: in a bookstore?

00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:09.810
[pause]

00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:18.960
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Oh, boy. I'd probably place
it right next to wherever what's her name,

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:20.610
who ran for vice-president?

00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:21.690
&gt;&gt;several voice in unison: Sarah Palin.

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:25.570
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Yeah, right next to Sarah Palin's
book because or Mitt Romney's book because

00:37:25.570 --> 00:37:27.750
people are buying those; so just right next
to theirs.

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:28.750
[laughter]

00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:30.830
That's where I'd like it. I don't care a particular
section.

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:36.820
By the way, can I also say, and I'm saying
this on YouTube; if Sarah Palin runs for President

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:38.900
I am vowing to run for President.

00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:39.900
[laughter]

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:40.900
[applause]

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:49.140
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Here's why: I don't want to
win, know that. But you need somebody at the

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:51.120
debates that when she's done talking –

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:52.120
[laughter]

00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:54.990
and she's says one of her things than I can
look over and go, "What the fuck are you talking

00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:55.990
about?"

00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:56.990
[laughter]

00:37:56.990 --> 00:38:06.720
And I won't care when I'm kicked out of the
debate. I will, I will have said my piece;

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:07.720
we all would have had a good chuckle.

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:08.720
[laughter]

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:11.060
So I want to say that.
Alright, so yes.

00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:14.590
&gt;&gt;male voice in audience: I'm about half way
through the book too, but I, I was pretty

00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:17.560
surprised that you, I think it was at 36 you
said you had the stroke?

00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:19.760
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: I had the stroke at 36, 37
yeah, around there.

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:22.820
&gt;&gt;male voice in audience: Yeah, and can you
just talk a little bit about, I guess, how

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:27.090
you got through that time because I remember
when you said something about your mother-in-law

00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:30.680
walkin' around the house and sort of looking
at you a little suspiciously. Did she -

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:36.660
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Well, I mean, let me, let me.
Okay. So I, I had a stroke in 2000, February

00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:37.870
of 2000.

00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:46.970
And prior to the stroke I'd gotten in a car,
I got rear-ended in a car accident. I had

00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:52.290
whiplash, which is extremely painful. And
while I had whiplash and I couldn't sleep

00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:56.850
and I was crying a lot cause the pain was
so intense, my mother-in-law was staying with

00:38:56.850 --> 00:38:57.850
us.

00:38:57.850 --> 00:39:03.240
And at that point she still didn't know what
to make of me, you know. And so when you're

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:09.120
in great stress and pain you don't want someone
looking at you with everything you do.

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:10.370
[laughter]

00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:15.500
I thought and my wife who was pregnant with
our second child, I was like sort of, my eye

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:19.180
was drooping; and the, it was just a bad situation.

00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:25.250
And then one morning I woke up and had a stroke
which was a joy for everyone.

00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:31.550
Yeah, I don't know what got me through it;
persaverance. I talk about it in the book,

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:34.391
the end of the book. I talk about it early
in the book and I talk about it at the end

00:39:34.391 --> 00:39:39.831
of the book, how I sort of recovered from
that and it's really the ending of the book

00:39:39.831 --> 00:39:45.770
so I don't wanna give it away 'cause it's
a, a very personal thing, so. I mean personal

00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:48.020
that I'd share, but not, you know what I mean.
Okay.

00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:49.760
So, Jessie what are you doing?

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:52.480
&gt;&gt;Jessie: So unfortunately we only have, you
know something bad is about to happen. No,

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:55.680
we only have time for one more question. Our
friends in Santa Monica would like to ask

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:56.680
it, but

00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:57.680
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Oh, okay.

00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:59.380
&gt;&gt;Jessie: just make sure we leave time for
signings, personal questions, and -

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:00.380
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Okay, sure.

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:01.380
&gt;&gt;Jessie: [unintelligible]

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:02.380
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Okay, so who's asking in Santa
Monica?

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:03.750
&gt;&gt;Julie: Julie is.

00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:07.200
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Oh Julie. I love you, Julie.

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:08.200
[laughter]

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:11.540
&gt;&gt;Julie: I figured since we began together
we should end together.

00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:16.990
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: I think that's the way to do
it, Julie. Julie who really shows what it's

00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:18.180
like to appreciate me.

00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:19.180
[laughter]

00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:22.700
Everyone in the country who's watching us
right now, could learn a lot from Julie.

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:23.700
[laughter]

00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:26.201
Thank you, Julie my number one fan. Go sister,
go.

00:40:26.201 --> 00:40:27.201
[laughter]

00:40:27.201 --> 00:40:34.474
&gt;&gt;Julie: Okay, my question is about Curb.
'Cause I noticed when you guys did the panel

00:40:34.474 --> 00:40:35.474
discussion last week you were all cracking
each other up a lot.

00:40:35.474 --> 00:40:36.474
So I'm wondering like how many takes do you
have to do of a scene on average since so

00:40:36.474 --> 00:40:40.180
much of it is improve, and I imagine you're
making each other laugh? Is it hard not to

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:48.990
break character or do you have like a method
way of acting that gets you through it?

00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:54.870
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Well, for me I don't break
character 'cause I'm a professional.

00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:55.870
[laughter]

00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:59.390
And so I'm not sort of sittin' back and enjoying
going, "This is great." I'm focused on my

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:00.390
work.

00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:04.890
I have laughed one time where I could not
control myself; one time in all the years.

00:41:04.890 --> 00:41:09.670
And that was this past season when Larry dropped
his pants and he was wearing the red panties.

00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:10.670
[laughter]

00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:16.790
I knew it was coming, I knew it was coming
but I wasn't prepared for it. And so when

00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:23.030
he dropped his pants and he's wearing little
red panties, I fell over and it took like

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:24.490
ten minutes for me to recover.

00:41:24.490 --> 00:41:25.490
[laughter]

00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:31.640
That's was very, it was unsettling and hysterical
at the same time. So yeah, one time I did.

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:36.200
We do laugh, but Larry laughs the most. If
he finds something funny sometimes it's hard

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:41.620
to, to pull him back. 'Cause he just likes
laughin'. But we all laugh all day. I've got

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:43.180
a great job; it's like Google.

00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:44.180
[laughter]

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:45.500
&gt;&gt;male voice in audience: So funny

00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:47.450
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: I'll see you Friday.

00:41:47.450 --> 00:41:49.431
&gt;&gt;Julie: I'll be there.

00:41:49.431 --> 00:41:54.720
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: You will cool. Alright. So
I'm goin' be, I'm sorry you can't participate

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:57.380
in the next part. But there be books there
on Friday.

00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:02.860
But I am, I'm going to sign and hang out and
talk to whoever wants to talk to me.

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:03.860
&gt;&gt;male voice in audience: Well, thanks again,
Jeff Garlin.

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:04.860
&gt;&gt;Jeff Garlin: Alright, thank you. Thank you
very much.

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:04.861
[applause]
