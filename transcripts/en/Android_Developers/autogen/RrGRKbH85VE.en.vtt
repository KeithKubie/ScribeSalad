 My name is Jason, CEO of Veewo 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.000
 We specialize in creating small but fun games 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.660
 Since we started our company in 2011. 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.260
 Some of our games have been officially promoted to Google Play 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.680
 Such as Dark Slash: Hero and Just Get 10 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.020
 Our latest games have been a good hit 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.880
 World-wide is a movement game 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.520
 Called Super Phantom Cat 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.460
 And thanks to the Google Play Games services 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.800
 We were able to reach as many Android users as possible 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.440
 Where the game achieved 870 thousand visits and 120 thousand downloads in a week. 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.720
 It is an extraordinary achievement that we never imagined before 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.460
 Make a decision to make it possible to work on Android TV at an early stage. 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.180
 10% of our users currently play the game on TV. 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.340
 As game makers, in our youth we were fans of television games, and we are very proud. 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.720
 I'm "Yup" Veewo product 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.760

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.560
 Success on Google Play. 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.560

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.880
 The number of users rose steadily from 4.1 to 4.6. 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.740
 Thanks to the game distribution model on groups, 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.680
 We were able to aggregate valuable comments 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.200
 Before making any bold updates 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.440
 We have made our game very stable in quality. 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.900
 Google Play helps us live up to the promise we made with the best games. 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.680
 Admob is at the top of our revenue resources 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.680

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.920

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.060
 The company's income has increased tenfold over the last four years. 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.700
 Google Play also allows us to respond to user feedback in comments on games. 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.440
 This feature has not only helped us reduce our users' loss by only 31% 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.520
 But gave us an opportunity to establish friendship between us and some players. 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.360
 Players want to talk to game developers, and we're more sure about it now. 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.080
 Promotional codes give us a new way to work 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.980

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.840
 We can offer rewards in the form of a unique virtual character design or level with special content. 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.200
 Google Play makes it easy to connect with players 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.220
 It helps us improve the game and facilitate its work. 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.640
 About 70% of our businesses and players now have their primary Android system source 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.740

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.620
