00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.241
So now we know how to divide and multiply with inequalities. In fact,

00:00:04.241 --> 00:00:08.829
inequalities seem to be just like equations, except that if we multiply or

00:00:08.829 --> 00:00:13.713
divide by a negative number, when we're doing an inequality, we need to flip the

00:00:13.713 --> 00:00:18.861
direction that the inequality faces. So, let's try a slightly tougher one now. We

00:00:18.861 --> 00:00:23.962
have 3x plus 2 is less then equal to 11. Now 11 happens to be my favorite number

00:00:23.962 --> 00:00:28.835
in the entire world, so treat it well when you're solving this inequality.

00:00:28.835 --> 00:00:33.236
Please solve for x and write the inequality that you get in this box.
