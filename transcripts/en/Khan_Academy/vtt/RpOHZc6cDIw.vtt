00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.130
In the video on black
hole several people

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.620
asked what is actually a
pretty good question, which

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.610
is if the mass of say a black
hole is only two or three

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.630
solar masses, why is
the gravity so strong?

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.090
Obviously the sun's
gravity isn't so strong

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.700
that it keeps light from
escaping, so why would

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.580
something, or even a star that's
two or three solar masses--

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.480
its gravity isn't so strong that
it keeps light from escaping.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.480
Why would a black hole that has
the same mass, why would that

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.160
keep light from escaping?

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.410
And to understand
that, I'll just

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.997
do Newtonian classical
physics right here.

00:00:36.997 --> 00:00:39.330
I won't get into the whole
general relativity of things.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.704
And this really
will just give us

00:00:40.704 --> 00:00:45.140
the intuition of why a smaller,
denser thing of the same mass

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.520
can exert a stronger
gravitational pull.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.870
So let's take two examples.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:02.470
Let's say I have some star
here that has a mass m1.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:10.100
And let's say that its radius,
let's just call this r.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.470
And let's say that I have
some other mass right

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.290
at the surface of
the star, somehow

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.720
able to survive those
surface temperatures.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.950
And this mass over
here has a mass of m2.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.700
The universal law of
gravitation tells us

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.370
that the force between
these two masses

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.840
is going to be equal to the
gravitational constant times

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.350
the product of the masses.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:53.190
So m1 times m2, all of that over
the square of the distance r

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.750
squared.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:54.833
Now, let me be very clear.

00:01:54.833 --> 00:01:57.930
You might say, wait, this
magenta mass right here

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.650
is touching this larger mass.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:00.910
Isn't the distance 0?

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.410
And you have to be very careful.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.220
This is the distance between
their center of masses.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.830
So the center of mass of
this large mass over here

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.870
is r away from this mass
that's on the surface.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.070
Now, with that said, let's
take another example.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.430
Let's say that this large
massive star, or whatever

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.770
it might be,
eventually condenses

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.380
into something
1,000 times smaller.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.160
So let me draw it like this.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.860
And obviously I'm not
drawing it to scale.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.540
So let's say we have
another case like this.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.570
And I'm not drawing it to scale.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.537
So this object, maybe
it's the same object

00:02:38.537 --> 00:02:40.120
or maybe it's a
different object, that

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.170
has the exact same mass
as this larger object,

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.840
but now it has a
much smaller radius.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:57.220
Now the radius is 1/1,000
of this radius over here.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.780
So maybe I'll just
call it r/1,000.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.620
So if this had a million
kilometer radius,

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.690
so that would make it roughly
about twice the radius

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.760
of the sun, if this was a
million kilometer radius right

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.040
over here, this would be
1,000 kilometer radius.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.760
So maybe we're talking
about something

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.180
that's approaching
a neutron star.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.040
But we don't have to think
about what it actually is.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.164
Let's just think about the
thought experiment here.

00:03:22.164 --> 00:03:23.940
So let's say I have
this thing over here.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.810
And let's say I have something
on the surface of this.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.380
So let's say I have
that same mass that's

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.590
on the surface of this thing.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.970
So this is m2 right over here.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.240
So what is going to be the
force between these two masses?

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.630
How strong are
they going to want

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.600
to-- What's the force
pulling them together?

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.870
So let's just do the universal
law of gravitation again.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.040
Let's just call this force one,
and let's call this force two.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.610
Once again, it's going to be
the gravitational constant times

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.790
the product of their masses.

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.690
So the big m1 times
the smaller mass, m2,

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.540
all of that over this distance
squared, this radius squared.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.880
Remember, it's the distance
to the center of masses.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.020
This center of mass here,
we're considering m2

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.430
to kind of be just a point
mass right over there.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.240
So what's the radius squared?

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:22.070
It's going to be
r/1,000 squared.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.460
Or if we simplify this
what will this be?

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.920
This is the same thing.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.550
And I'll just write
it in one color,

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.420
just because it takes less time.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.570
Gravitational
constant m1 m2 over r

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.030
squared over 1,000
squared, or over 1 million.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.350
That's just 1,000 squared.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.230
Or we can multiply the
numerator and the denominator

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:55.270
by 1 million, and this is going
to be equal to 1 million--

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.945
I'm going to write
it out, 1 million.

00:04:56.945 --> 00:04:59.220
Let me scroll to the
right a little bit--

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.980
times the gravitational
constant, times m1 m2,

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.990
all of that over r squared.

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.420
Now, what is this
thing right over here?

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.530
That's the same
thing as this F1.

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:18.620
So this is going to
be 1 million times F1.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.460
So even though the masses
involved are the same,

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.590
this yellow object right
here is the same mass

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.930
as this larger object over here.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.280
It's able to exert a million
times the gravitational force

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.170
on this point mass.

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:33.170
And actually vice versa.

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:34.550
They're both being attracted.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.940
They're both exerting
this on each other.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.670
And the reality is, because
this thing is smaller,

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.420
because this m1 on the right
here, this one I'm coloring in,

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.880
because this one is
smaller and denser,

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.800
this particle is able to get
closer to its center of mass.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.940
Now, you might be saying,
OK, well, I can buy that.

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.030
This just comes straight
from the universal law

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.900
of gravitation.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.356
But wouldn't something
closer to this center of mass

00:05:59.356 --> 00:06:00.480
experience that same thing?

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:06.420
If this was a star, wouldn't
photons that are over here,

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.280
wouldn't this experience
the same force?

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:16.180
If this distance right here is
r/1,000 wouldn't some photon

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.710
here, or atom here, or molecule,
or whatever it's over here,

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.610
wouldn't that experience
the same force,

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.150
this million times the
force as this thing?

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.200
And you've got to
remember, all of a sudden

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.970
when this thing is inside
of this larger mass, what's

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.960
happening?

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.210
The entire mass is no
longer pulling on it

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:36.720
in that direction.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.340
It's no longer pulling it
in that inward direction.

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.760
You now have all of
this mass over here.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.780
Let me think of the best
way that's doing it.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.890
So you can think of it
all of this mass over here

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:50.720
is pulling it in an
outward direction.

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.080
It's not telling.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.640
What that mass out
there is doing,

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:02.480
since that mass itself
is being pulled inward,

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.650
it is pushing down on this.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.930
It is exerting
pressure on that point.

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.600
But the actual
gravitational force

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.630
that that point is experiencing
is actually going to be less.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:14.980
It's actually going to
be mitigated by the fact

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:19.490
that there's so
much mass over here

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:22.061
pulling in the other direction.

00:07:22.061 --> 00:07:23.560
And so you could
imagine if you were

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:29.080
in the center of a
really massive object--

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.610
so that's a really
massive object.

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.400
If you were in the
center, there would

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.610
be no net gravitational
force being pulled on you,

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:37.860
because you're at
its center of mass.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.170
The rest of the mass is outward.

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:44.510
So at every point it will
be pulling you outward.

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:47.220
And so that's why if you were
to enter the core of a star,

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.470
if you were to get a lot
closer to its center of mass,

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:52.780
it's not going to be pulling
on you with this type of force.

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:55.460
And the only way you can
get these types of forces

00:07:55.460 --> 00:08:00.010
is if the entire mass
is contained in a very

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:02.890
dense region, in a
very small region.

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:05.180
And that's why a black
hole is able to exert

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:09.480
such strong gravity that
not even light can escape.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.730
Hopefully that clarifies
things a little bit.
