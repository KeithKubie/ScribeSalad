00:00:02.964 --> 00:00:03.952
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:05.434 --> 00:00:06.619
PATTON OSWALT: Hey.

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:07.410
How you doing, man?

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.045
MALE SPEAKER: So, one of things
that comes up on YouTube when

00:00:15.045 --> 00:00:17.600
I search you is the Star Wars
Filibuster on "Parks and Rec."

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.400
PATTON OSWALT: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.562
Thank you, yes.

00:00:22.562 --> 00:00:24.020
MALE SPEAKER: And
you have a story.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.460
It went on for eight
minutes, I believe.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.607
And everybody had
left the room by then.

00:00:29.607 --> 00:00:30.440
PATTON OSWALT: Yeah.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.872
Well, I mean it was, the
whole thing was improvised.

00:00:33.872 --> 00:00:36.205
They had said, all you got
to do is talk for 30 seconds,

00:00:36.205 --> 00:00:39.720
then Amy and Jon Glaser
are going to cut you off

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.220
and the scene will continue.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.810
And then, I guess as a prank,
they said, let's not yell cut

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.120
and see how long he goes.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.330
And I, you know, I'm
such a fan of that show.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.540
I'm such a "Parks and
Rec" fan that I just

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.450
kept, out of terror,
I didn't know

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.560
what, I didn't want
to stop talking.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.050
And so I just unloaded every
bit of comic book and movie

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.940
ephemera that was in my head at
that second for eight minutes.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.000
And then as an improv, it
was Amy and John started it.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.750
They just got up and left.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.700
And then to the credit
of the day players,

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.230
they all also got the idea
of like, oh, screw this.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.040
And everyone walked out.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.970
It was pretty amazing.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.303
It was, I mean, the whole thing.

00:01:24.303 --> 00:01:28.190
I was, I learned some
dark things about myself.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.300
You know, there's the--

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.440
PATTON OSWALT: There's
a fight or flight

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.648
response when you're nervous.

00:01:32.648 --> 00:01:35.570
And there's also apparently
the trivia dump response.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.800
And that's, if a
bear ever rushes me,

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.960
I'm going to, you know,
reel off the second unit

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.660
credits for Blade Runner
I guess before I'm killed.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.880
MALE SPEAKER: So you
had a movie addiction.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.760
And Star Wars played
a part in ending it?

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.460
Is that right?

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.043
PATTON OSWALT: Well,
I mean it helped.

00:01:54.043 --> 00:01:56.450
There were a lot a little
kicks along the way.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.390
You know, I had gotten to
this point where I was just

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.260
seeing three or four
movies a day basically.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.290
And it was affecting
everything, social life.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.600
And so, and it started
in December of '95.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.560
Summer of '99 I went and
saw the "Phantom Menace"

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.233
and as awful as
that film was, what

00:02:15.233 --> 00:02:19.250
was even more awful for me was
the weeks and months afterwards

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.390
I spent sitting
in cafes and bars

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.910
and just hanging
with my friends,

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.900
just arguing and yammering
about this movie.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.475
And it was this kind of
awakening of oh, you know,

00:02:30.475 --> 00:02:31.910
he's made some good movies.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.580
He made a really god awful one.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.780
And the god awful one
I'm spending the time

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.660
that I could be
spending, why don't you

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.570
write a better one instead of
you know, just argue about it

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.261
the whole time?

00:02:42.261 --> 00:02:44.010
MALE SPEAKER: What was
the addiction like?

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.731
I mean, did you-- I
went through the movies

00:02:46.731 --> 00:02:48.730
actually, in the back
here, and I've checked off

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.390
which ones we've shown
here on Thursday nights.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.500
PATTON OSWALT: Uh huh.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.960
MALE SPEAKER: And I didn't
realize how many pages there

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.460
were.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.400
But I came up to 66.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.191
PATTON OSWALT: Wow.

00:02:55.191 --> 00:02:57.225
MALE SPEAKER: There must
be about 3,000 in here.

00:02:57.225 --> 00:02:58.100
PATTON OS WALT: Yeah.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.110
The addiction was, it got-- when
I really, really bottomed out

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.440
was when I was blowing off
social events, parties.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.250
Or for showing up late, almost
not making shows in time

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.070
so that I could go see
a movie somewhere else.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.774
And it was more--
and near the end

00:03:17.774 --> 00:03:19.440
I don't think I was
enjoying the movies.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.720
I was acquiring the
experience of having

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.740
said that I'd seen them.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.296
But if I was to be
honest, if I then sat down

00:03:27.296 --> 00:03:28.920
to talk to anyone
about them at length,

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.710
I actually didn't
know any details

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.366
and hadn't gotten any
actual personal impressions

00:03:33.366 --> 00:03:34.740
that would change
me as a person.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.750
I was just this, I was
a less-funny version

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.755
of what I did in "Parks
and Rec" basically.

00:03:40.755 --> 00:03:46.110
I was just unloading
information about these movies.

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.445
MALE SPEAKER: You had
a relationship end

00:03:48.445 --> 00:03:50.450
over your addiction to movies?

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.312
PATTON OSWALT: It
didn't end specifically,

00:03:52.312 --> 00:03:54.020
there were a lot of
things that ended it.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.860
But there was, yeah.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.190
Being at all-night
horror marathon one night

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.020
and at around 2:00 AM the
girl I was dating said,

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.020
hey, I'm going to leave.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.280
It's 2:00AM.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.440
And the movie "Daughter of
Horror," had just ended.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.250
And "I Married a Monster from
Outer Space" was starting.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.080
And I was, such was my
addiction that if I didn't

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.800
see every second of the
movie, it didn't count.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.290
So she had to walk out to
her car by herself at 2:00 AM

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.870
because I didn't walk-- yeah.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.420
That was my like,
leaving my baby

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.220
in the car to go
score heroin moment.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.299
Like, that was the equivalent of
a movie fiend version of that.

00:04:33.299 --> 00:04:35.340
MALE SPEAKER: So you still
want to be a director?

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.700
PATTON OSWALT: Yeah.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:36.650
I mean, eventually.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.880
It'll start off, I think,
over the next few years

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:41.980
making some short films.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.560
And then eventually, yes.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.180
I just don't know how
it's going to happen.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.380
It's something
that I want to do.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.922
MALE SPEAKER: And
who would be in it?

00:04:49.922 --> 00:04:51.755
PATTON OSWALT: I can't
even, I have no idea.

00:04:51.755 --> 00:04:52.745
I can't say.

00:04:52.745 --> 00:04:55.120
Who knows who will be around
whenever I get around to it?

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.520
I have no idea who
I'll have access to,

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.740
who will want to do it.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:00.920
I have, I don't know.

00:05:03.367 --> 00:05:05.450
MALE SPEAKER: The story I
really liked in the book

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.655
was about "The Day
the Clown Cried,"

00:05:08.655 --> 00:05:10.610
that movie that never
got made, I guess.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:11.610
PATTON OSWALT: Well, no.

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:12.640
It got made.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:18.700
"The Day the Clown
Cried" is a-- Jerry Lewis

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.262
made a movie in the late '60s.

00:05:20.262 --> 00:05:21.720
It started off, it
was a screenplay

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.600
called "The Day
The Clown Cried."

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.542
It was apparently based on
fact, or rumor, or something.

00:05:27.542 --> 00:05:29.000
These two writers
wrote it and it's

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.150
about a clown who gets
put into Auschwitz

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.640
and the Nazis are
having trouble getting

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.950
the kids to go into
the gas oven so they

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.430
get the clown to entertain the
kids on the way to the ovens

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.730
and he eventually
ends up walking

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:44.580
into the ovens with the kids.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.267
So this is a straight
dramatic script.

00:05:46.267 --> 00:05:47.850
It was making the
rounds in Hollywood.

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.150
And who picks it up?

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.980
Jerry Lewis.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.240
Jerry Lewis decides
to make this movie.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.700
First does a rewrite of the
script to add some comedy.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.020
Gotta add a little comedy.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.300
It's cold in Auschwitz so his
socks stand up by himself.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.430
And it's, again,
this was when he

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.640
is in the depths of
his percocet addiction,

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.740
so the movie gets shot.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.067
There's all these rumors.

00:06:11.067 --> 00:06:13.400
Either he didn't have the
rights to go and do it himself

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.240
or the studio saw it
and was horrified.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.840
But it never got released.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.710
I got my hands on the
screenplay and started

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:25.760
doing the readings of it
in LA, kind of invite only.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.980
And then word got to the wrong
people that we were doing it

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.627
and chaos ensued.

00:06:31.627 --> 00:06:33.210
MALE SPEAKER: So
there was going to be

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.100
a reading at the
Santa Monica Civic?

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.180
PATTON OSWALT: Santa
Monica Powerhouse Theater.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.429
MALE SPEAKER: And it got
shut down at the last minute?

00:06:40.429 --> 00:06:44.020
PATTON OSWALT: I got served
with a cease and desist order.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.150
Again, it's a very, I go into
very ugly detail about it

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:49.040
as to what happened.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:54.000
But you know, there was a
lot of last-minute improving

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.290
and skirting around
what had happened.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.134
You'll see when, it's
in the-- otherwise,

00:07:02.134 --> 00:07:03.550
I could recount
the whole chapter,

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:05.030
but I figured I would
leave a little teaser.

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:05.930
MALE SPEAKER: We want
to sell the books, yeah.

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:06.620
PATTON OSWALT: Yeah, yeah.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:07.250
Exactly.

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.720
Yeah, so.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.282
MALE SPEAKER: You're still doing
stand up quite often right?

00:07:12.282 --> 00:07:13.073
PATTON OSWALT: Mhm.

00:07:13.073 --> 00:07:14.610
I still do a lot of shows.

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:16.550
I'm working on a new
special for the summer.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.320
I'll probably shoot
it in the summer.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.903
I mean, stand up is
never going to go.

00:07:19.903 --> 00:07:21.540
That was always
an abiding thing.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.480
It's kind of what
brought me to the dance

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.760
and so I'm just sort of,
I'll never give that part up.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.090
I'll always do stand up.

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:30.256
MALE SPEAKER: Why do you
think so many comedians are

00:07:30.256 --> 00:07:32.004
such good actors?

00:07:32.004 --> 00:07:33.420
PATTON OSWALT: I
mean, I would say

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:38.130
that the ratio of good actors
to comedians is about the same

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:41.560
as the ratio of-- you know
who I think actually makes

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.780
better actors than comedians?

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.446
If you're going to talk in terms
of the ratio of the people that

00:07:45.446 --> 00:07:48.890
try it out that are good at
it, are country-music singers.

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:52.270
People like Dwight
Yokum, and Willie Nelson,

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.290
and Dolly Parton.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:58.090
For some reason, they
make great actors.

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.700
I mean, some comedians are,
I think a lot of comedians

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.580
are good actors because we have
to inhabit different personas

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:05.770
when we're trying to
either tell a story

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:07.950
or get a point across on stage.

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:09.970
So it becomes--
although, sometimes that

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:13.520
can be to a disadvantage because
if you find a comedic voice

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.350
and it's the one that
works for you the most,

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:21.002
you'll cleave to that even if
the role doesn't call for it.

00:08:21.002 --> 00:08:22.460
MALE SPEAKER: I
re-watched a couple

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.710
of the movies that you
had major roles in,

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:29.561
"Young Adult" and "Big Fan,"
which was, I told you at lunch,

00:08:29.561 --> 00:08:31.560
I was not able to persuade
my fellow cinema club

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.179
members to put that on here.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:36.510
That was a good move,
fellow cinema cult members

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:39.230
because that movie's
a downer and it'll

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:41.140
be very hard to kind
of leap back into work

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:42.140
after watching that one.

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:43.510
So, watch it.

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:47.080
It's good, but a bummer.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.240
MALE SPEAKER: And
you seem to play,

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.534
I guess, speaking of
being in the wheelhouse

00:08:51.534 --> 00:08:53.450
or something, a lot
times, your characters are

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:57.180
these single guys who are
fairly young and obsessive

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.440
about action figures
or Star Wars.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.706
PATTON OSWALT: Somehow
I'm able to pull that off.

00:09:02.706 --> 00:09:04.347
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:04.347 --> 00:09:06.180
PATTON OSWALT: It's a
leap I make every time

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.580
but it's a leap of faith.

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:09.130
I don't know.

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:13.390
You know, it's like, buddy, put
down the put down the weights

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:16.960
and stop the taekwondo
lessons and let's

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.758
try to play one of these
chubby, pasty geeks for once.

00:09:19.758 --> 00:09:21.700
It's tough.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:22.330
"Young Adult."

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.880
I gained 40 pounds
for that movie

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.224
20 years before
Diablo Cody wrote it.

00:09:27.224 --> 00:09:32.820
That is how committed
I was to that script.

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.320
MALE SPEAKER: And
actually, I wanted

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.890
to quote something
that's Charlize

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:38.030
Theron said about
you in the movie.

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:41.370
She's watching you and says,
"look at his face, so doughy.

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:44.357
He looks like a murderer."

00:09:44.357 --> 00:09:45.190
PATTON OSWALT: Yeah.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:47.590
No, that was a pretty-- and
the way they shot me too.

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:49.790
If you notice, I have
this kind of under lit,

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:53.990
I do look like a
murderer in that shot.

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:56.810
I think that's how she described
me when we were casting it too.

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:58.810
MALE SPEAKER: That somebody
looks like a murder?

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:00.935
PATTON OSWALT: Yeah, that
dude's a murderer, right?

00:10:00.935 --> 00:10:03.802
MALE SPEAKER: I could see
you in a taekwondo movie.

00:10:03.802 --> 00:10:06.260
PATTON OSWALT: You could see
me in a taekwondo movie or you

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:06.630
can't?

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:07.520
MALE SPEAKER: I'd go.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:07.940
PATTON OSWALT: You would?

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:08.856
MALE SPEAKER: Oh yeah.

00:10:08.856 --> 00:10:11.520
PATTON OSWALT: Yeah, for to
the horror value of it, yeah.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:14.530
My god.

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:22.730
"Pasty Fury." "Beyond the Pale."

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:24.036
Sorry, go ahead.

00:10:24.036 --> 00:10:25.660
MALE SPEAKER: His
mind is spinning here

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.290
and now he's thinking
who would direct it.

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:29.040
PATTON OSWALT: That
would be the tag line.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.880
Like, your taekwondo
skills pale in comparison.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:35.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:38.730
PATTON OSWALT: "Pasty Fury."

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:42.200
MALE SPEAKER: I also like the
story about you in Amsterdam.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:42.950
And you--

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:44.650
PATTON OSWALT: Yeah.

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:45.150
Which one?

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:46.710
There was a bunch of
stories about Amsterdam.

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:47.480
MALE SPEAKER: The
Snickers bar with--

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.360
PATTON OSWALT: Oh, Jesus.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:48.860
Yeah.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:53.830
Well, I went to Amsterdam
in '99 and there's

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:55.316
a coffee shop called
Lucky Mothers.

00:10:55.316 --> 00:10:56.940
I don't know if it's
still there but it

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:58.390
was one of the
last coffee shops.

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:00.973
They were doing this weird thing
where you could still get pot

00:11:00.973 --> 00:11:03.730
but they were kind of getting
rid of the getting it food.

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:06.300
You couldn't get
it in food as much.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.310
But this one place still put
it into food so they would go,

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:11.080
we'll make tea, or
we'll roll you a joint,

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.705
or we'll put it
in a Snickers bar.

00:11:12.705 --> 00:11:14.580
And I said, oh yeah,
put it in-- that's cool.

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:17.830
And so what they, I
guess they just assumed,

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:19.030
he knows what he's doing.

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:22.790
They put three joints worth
of weed in a Snickers bar.

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:25.460
And then I ate it in
the space of an hour.

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:28.100
Like, just walk around,
Snickers bar, done.

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.760
PATTON OSWALT: And then I
had to do a show that night

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:36.290
and I was perfectly coherent,
could order my thoughts,

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:36.825
could speak.

00:11:39.555 --> 00:11:41.430
I could speak so that
you could understand me

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:44.880
but I could not open my eyes.

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.085
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:46.085 --> 00:11:47.460
PATTON OSWALT: I
could speak fine

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:50.150
and I even said on
stage, I'm sorry.

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:52.750
I cannot open my eyes right now.

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:53.720
They won't open.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.860
And I am fine, everything's OK.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.850
And I'm going to do my bits but
my eyes are going to be closed.

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:02.349
And the crowd reacted
like, oh, he probably

00:12:02.349 --> 00:12:03.890
ate a whole-- he's
an American and he

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:06.944
ate the whole-- they'd
clearly seen that before.

00:12:06.944 --> 00:12:07.860
They're like, oh yeah.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.850
These guys.

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:12.530
That was also the day that they
were going to interview me.

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:15.272
I was there with
Louis C.K. And they

00:12:15.272 --> 00:12:16.980
were going to interview
us for a local TV

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.330
station about the show
we were going to do.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.389
And so they're getting
us ready and they said,

00:12:21.389 --> 00:12:23.180
so are you ready to go
on Dutch television?

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.310
And that, to me, I just loved.

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:27.880
Because it sounds like
'50s beatnik drug slang.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:31.420
You know, like, hey, I
know we're drinking beer

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:34.146
but do you want to go
on Dutch television?

00:12:34.146 --> 00:12:36.370
Like, yeah, I want to
go on Dutch-- I'm ready.

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:38.379
Yeah, I'm cool.

00:12:38.379 --> 00:12:40.920
MALE SPEAKER: Never turn down
the chance to go on television.

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:41.753
PATTON OSWALT: Yeah.

00:12:41.753 --> 00:12:42.740
Gore Vidal.

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:44.370
Sex and televy.

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:45.935
Did I just say televy?

00:12:45.935 --> 00:12:48.151
Oh my god.

00:12:48.151 --> 00:12:50.400
MALE SPEAKER: So you all can
line up at the microphone

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.330
if you have questions.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.160
I have a number of things that--

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.640
PATTON OSWALT: Don't make
it sound like a challenge.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:56.405
Y'all can line up
on the microphone,

00:12:56.405 --> 00:12:58.180
I don't know if I'm going
to-- You said it almost like

00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:59.390
you're then going
to follow with,

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:00.765
I don't know if
I'll call on you.

00:13:00.765 --> 00:13:02.800
You can line up.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:03.590
See what happens.

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:04.340
I'll call on him.

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:05.470
Oh.

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:07.462
Starting it off.

00:13:07.462 --> 00:13:08.920
MALE SPEAKER: In
the meantime, this

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.640
is the right crowd for
your "Star Wars" theory

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:13.504
about the Machete Order.

00:13:13.504 --> 00:13:14.920
I know they all
want to hear this.

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:16.090
PATTON OSWALT: Oh, I
wish that was my theory.

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:17.510
It's not my theory.

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:20.770
I talked about it and
I said when I was on,

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:24.257
I was on the "Tonight Show," and
I said, I did not make this up.

00:13:24.257 --> 00:13:25.340
Someone else made this up.

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:27.850
I'm sure one of you have
heard of the Machete Order.

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:28.350
Anyone?

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:29.230
Yeah, OK.

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:32.110
So some guy-- does any
one who invented it?

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:32.780
The name?

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:33.280
Right.

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.238
Somebody invented this.

00:13:34.238 --> 00:13:35.340
It's so genius.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:37.850
It's a way to watch the
six "Star Wars" movies

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:39.640
so that it becomes
a brilliant saga.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:45.330
And what you do is, Episode
One, "Phantom Menace,"

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:46.580
doesn't exist.

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:47.540
It doesn't exist.

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:50.440
There's not a single piece
of information in that movie

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.990
that you need to watch
any of the other ones.

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:55.480
There's no-- so that
movie doesn't exist.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.200
You start off, you watch
Episode Four, "Star Wars."

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.980
Young farm boy
joins the rebellion,

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:02.660
defeats this bad
guy, everything.

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:03.520
OK, wow.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.930
Nice.

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:06.620
"Empire Strikes Back."

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:09.970
Farm boy is now learning
to be a Jedi knight,

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:11.220
meets the bad guy he defeated.

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:13.090
Guy goes, oh,
actually, I'm your dad.

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:14.230
What?

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:15.570
And then the movie is over.

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:17.070
And that's the cliffhanger.

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:19.090
Then you watch Episode Two.

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:22.310
Now you see his dad as a
teenager, kind of the same age

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:23.700
that Luke was.

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:26.260
And we see him going through
the same thing that Luke

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.520
did except he makes all the
wrong choices and become

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.120
evil, evil, evil, evil.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.070
Then you watch the third
one, "Revenge of the Sith."

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:35.750
He totally goes over evil.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:41.090
Kills kids, attacks his
master, becomes Darth Vader,

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:42.980
swears allegiance
to the Emperor.

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:45.450
Then you watch
"Return of the Jedi."

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:49.790
The son now redeems this
father who has fallen

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:54.800
and now it becomes this awesome
"Godfather II" like saga

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.740
with actual tension and
character arcs and pay off.

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:00.610
And it's a brilliant
way to watch the series.

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:02.090
And if you watch
that way, there's

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:04.655
like three minutes
of Jar Jar Binks.

00:15:04.655 --> 00:15:06.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:08.700
MALE SPEAKER: That's two
minutes and 59 seconds too many?

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:09.533
PATTON OSWALT: Yeah.

00:15:09.533 --> 00:15:10.300
Yeah.

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:13.330
Well, also, I remember
talking to Brad Bird.

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:15.210
We always get together
and talk about movies

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:17.430
and he said this really
interesting thing about--

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:19.140
and this was years
before I'd ever

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:20.490
heard of the Machete Order.

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:23.280
He said, "Return of the
Jedi" starts off wrong.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.900
It starts off with this weird,
kind of a long shot of Vader

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.850
getting off of a ship
and they don't give him

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:31.140
the entrance he deserves and
you know, all this stuff.

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:33.320
What it should have
started off with was,

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.944
in the previous movie, Luke
get's this psychic fact,

00:15:35.944 --> 00:15:37.110
your friends are in trouble.

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:38.700
You've got to help them.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:40.330
And Yoda goes, don't go.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:41.350
You can't do anything.

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:42.630
Luke's like, I'm the hero.

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:43.590
That's what heroes do.

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:44.580
You're wrong.

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:48.570
He goes, gets his ass
kicked, gets his friends

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:50.830
in worse trouble,
get his hand cut off.

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:54.700
Like, he could not screw
up any harder if he tried.

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:57.410
And then he goes,
"Return of the Jedi"

00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:00.980
should have began with
Luke back in the swamp.

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:04.280
Because when we next see
Luke, he's just this bad ass.

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:08.490
Just this total bad ass but they
should have started with Lucas

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:11.060
in the swamp with Yoda
going, you told me not to go.

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:12.250
I went.

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:16.860
I completely, I could not
have shit the bed any harder

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:18.070
as a Jedi.

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:21.590
And then Yoda goes,
now you're a Jedi

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:24.840
because you have you failed so
massively and you didn't die

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.590
and now you're over
the last lesson, which

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:28.210
was getting over
fear of failing.

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:30.780
So then when Luke goes
to Jabba's palace,

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:34.500
he's now this Zen-like, I'm
not even afraid of messing up.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.440
I've gone through all that.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.380
it's like, that's what makes
a comedian truly great.

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:43.290
It's not until you
completely screw up

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:44.254
that you're a comedian.

00:16:44.254 --> 00:16:45.170
I've always said that.

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:49.200
Until you eat it so hard and
then wake up the next day

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.600
and go, oh, the
world didn't end.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:51.308
It didn't matter.

00:16:51.308 --> 00:16:54.410
And then you're free to
do whatever you want.

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:54.910
So.

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:56.785
MALE SPEAKER: When did
you become a comedian?

00:16:56.785 --> 00:16:59.380
PATTON OSWALT: Two weeks ago.

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:00.270
Two weeks ago.

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:03.810
Oh no, I became a
comedian, oh god.

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:04.464
OK.

00:17:04.464 --> 00:17:06.089
I'll tell the story
then we'll open up.

00:17:06.089 --> 00:17:08.119
Because this story is
so depressing and then

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:09.630
we're going to need-- yeah, you.

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:12.020
You're pulling us out
of it so get ready.

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:13.895
MALE SPEAKER: I already
said I'd call on him.

00:17:13.895 --> 00:17:14.160
PATTON OSWALT: Yeah.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:14.690
Good.

00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:16.430
Well, yeah, but now
I want a challenge.

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:17.640
Let's throw a gauntlet
down in front of him.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.030
MALE SPEAKER: All
right, all right.

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:20.363
PATTON OSWALT: I was in Roanoke.

00:17:20.363 --> 00:17:24.319
Virginia in 1990, emceeing a
club, the Roanoke Comedy Club.

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:26.345
What a creative name
for a comedy club

00:17:26.345 --> 00:17:27.690
in Roanoke, Virginia.

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:32.300
And the day of, I get the
worst stomach flu of my life.

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.710
Like, I'm just, like, both ends.

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:36.920
Just, you know, like
a lawn sprinkler.

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:40.727
And so I did this
thing where I took--

00:17:40.727 --> 00:17:43.060
there's a thing called Stage
Health, where no matter how

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:46.860
sick you are, and your body
goes, you got to do 10 minutes?

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:48.780
I'll give you 10 minutes
of being healthy.

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:49.530
Got to do an hour?

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:50.488
I can give you an hour.

00:17:50.488 --> 00:17:51.680
And then you're sick again.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:52.661
It's this weird thing.

00:17:52.661 --> 00:17:54.910
And any performer will tell
you, this is a real thing.

00:17:54.910 --> 00:18:00.280
So that day I took all this
DayQuil and Pepto Bismol

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:01.272
and Dristan.

00:18:01.272 --> 00:18:03.480
And I timed it just right
so that just as the show is

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.850
beginning, there's my
10-minute window of health.

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:06.620
I can make it.

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:07.809
I can make it.

00:18:07.809 --> 00:18:09.850
And they go, ladies and
gentleman, Patton Oswalt.

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:11.810
I walk out on stage.

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:16.755
And as I'm walking up, a guy
in the front row went, faggot.

00:18:16.755 --> 00:18:17.420
Like that.

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:19.410
And he didn't yell
it like, angry.

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:22.630
He said it almost the way like
a guy giving a tour at a museum

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:24.060
would say it.

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:26.410
Here's a Klee and
that's a faggot.

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:28.390
And that's a, you know.

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:31.380
And the crowd just,
they all exploded.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:32.450
Yeah.

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:35.170
And then I went, ladies and
gentleman, your first comedian.

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:37.170
I just said the guy's
name and immediately left.

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:40.910
So it was just complete defeat.

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:42.594
And all I can think
of now is that like,

00:18:42.594 --> 00:18:44.010
and again, I woke
up the next day.

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:45.843
I was still sick but I
was still a comedian.

00:18:45.843 --> 00:18:49.030
It was like, oh, it'll
never get as bad as that.

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:50.390
It'll never get as bad as that.

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:54.000
So that was my-- although
now, I'm haunted by the idea

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.080
that there must have
been someone in that room

00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:00.090
that that was their
first-ever comedy show.

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:03.630
And they got a really horrible
idea of what stand up comedy

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:04.130
is.

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:06.260
Where they're like, it's funny.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:07.979
I mean, the two
comedians that go up.

00:19:07.979 --> 00:19:10.520
But do you know what they do at
the beginning of these shows?

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:13.380
They find some kid
that's like, dying

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.420
in a hospital or something.

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.200
And they have him
walk out and a guy

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.800
calls him a faggot and
everyone goes crazy.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.050
And it just seems really ugly.

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:22.120
Then the rest the show's great.

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.120
But that first, they've got
to change that first thing

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:24.619
they do.

00:19:24.619 --> 00:19:25.580
It's not nice.

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.220
MALE SPEAKER: They've probably
changed it since then.

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:27.990
PATTON OSWALT: Yeah, exactly.

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:28.800
So.

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:29.240
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.656
The gauntlet has
been thrown down.

00:19:30.656 --> 00:19:31.364
You're up.

00:19:31.364 --> 00:19:33.030
AUDIENCE: Thanks for
being here, Patton.

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:34.700
It's great to hear
your anecdotes.

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:35.320
PATTON OSWALT: Thank you.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:36.950
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
Louis C.K. And I actually

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:38.324
saw a video of
Louis C.K, I think

00:19:38.324 --> 00:19:40.780
it was at a memorial for
George Carlin a few years ago

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:44.120
talking about how he sort
of totally overhauled

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:46.760
the way that he does his
comedy, throwing out his jokes

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:49.290
every single year so that he
comes up with fresh material

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:52.050
and really sets the
bar high to achieve

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:53.155
new goals as a comedian.

00:19:53.155 --> 00:19:55.280
And you know, we do that
here at Google every year.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:56.900
We're setting very
aggressive goals and stuff.

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:57.401
How do you--

00:19:57.401 --> 00:19:58.650
PATTON OSWALT: I can't invest.

00:19:58.650 --> 00:19:59.180
I'm sorry.

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:00.138
I don't have any money.

00:20:00.138 --> 00:20:01.209
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:01.209 --> 00:20:02.500
PATTON OSWALT: Is this a pitch?

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.450
AUDIENCE: No, what
I'm asking is,

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:06.450
how do you set those
bars for yourself?

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:08.266
You know, you're
obviously wanting

00:20:08.266 --> 00:20:09.390
be a director and a writer.

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:11.681
Do you have a personal process
that you put it in place

00:20:11.681 --> 00:20:12.577
for yourself?

00:20:12.577 --> 00:20:13.910
And then I also have a question.

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:16.250
There was an episode of "King
of Queens" where you sat,

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:18.440
or you stood, in the living
room for like 10 minutes

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.110
without moving.

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:20.700
I'd love to hear
how that was done

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:22.260
and how you felt about that.

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:24.240
PATTON OSWALT: All right, I'll
go backwards. "King of Queens,"

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.865
all the writers and producers on
that show were massive stoners

00:20:26.865 --> 00:20:30.422
and they would always
want to pull pranks.

00:20:30.422 --> 00:20:32.130
And so there's all
kinds of hidden things

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:33.870
on that show, weird
little phrases that

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:34.787
come up for no reason.

00:20:34.787 --> 00:20:36.911
And I think that was one
of those things where they

00:20:36.911 --> 00:20:38.980
realized, oh, you don't
have a line in this scene

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:43.240
so why don't you just don't move
and see if they'll catch it?

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.460
And so the whole scene--
and not only did I not move,

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:46.950
there's an over
the shoulder shot

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:49.480
when they go into the kitchen
when I'm still not moving.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:50.620
It's really eerie.

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:53.250
I think it was just because
we were messing around.

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:55.020
They were always doing that.

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:59.200
As far as like my-- I have
different goals in terms

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:02.820
of output and then, you
know, I have certain people

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:06.490
I can show things to to
get-- I'm very lucky in terms

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:08.270
of my quality, at
least as a stand up.

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:09.960
I don't have this
yet as a filmmaker

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:12.110
because I haven't made a movie.

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:15.690
But the people I hang out
with are all funnier than me

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:18.845
so I always have to try to
shoot for that other level.

00:21:18.845 --> 00:21:21.140
And I think that's what
makes me as funny as I am,

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:24.150
is that I'm the least funny of
my circle of comedian friends.

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:27.240
And I'm not saying that, I
don't believe in false humility.

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.770
I think I'm a
really good comedian

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:32.300
but I know objectively, I'm
not as funny as the people

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:36.220
I hang out with and that
helps me write harder and work

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:37.650
harder at what I do.

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:42.350
It also really helps the
way that comedy fans are.

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:44.540
Once you put out an
album or a special,

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:46.470
you can't do that
material anymore.

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:48.300
I mean, you can.

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:50.840
But if you do it again, if
you do the material in front

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.010
of people that have already
bought it on an album,

00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:54.540
they'll laugh and
then they'll go,

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:56.310
there's no reason to
see that guy again.

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:57.630
Because that's all he does.

00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:59.620
And it's the
opposite, it's weird,

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:02.970
my musician friends, if they
put out an album and they tour,

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:05.120
they had better play that album.

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:07.130
They don't want to
hear your new stuff.

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:08.506
You're a comedian and
you put out an album,

00:22:08.506 --> 00:22:09.860
you had better
not do that album.

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:11.110
You better have all new stuff.

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:14.000
So that keeps me working
at a really nice pace.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.070
AUDIENCE: One of my
favorite rants you've done

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:18.490
is on the Paas Easter Egg Kit.

00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:19.520
PATTON OSWALT: Oh, wow.

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:21.294
AUDIENCE: So two questions.

00:22:21.294 --> 00:22:23.210
Have they approached you
to be a spokesperson?

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:24.140
Probably not.

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:25.030
And the second--

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:26.613
PATTON OSWALT: Why
would they want me?

00:22:26.613 --> 00:22:29.394
I talk about shoving eggs up
people's asses and the founder

00:22:29.394 --> 00:22:31.185
of their company being
addicted the whores.

00:22:31.185 --> 00:22:32.606
I don't think-- no.

00:22:32.606 --> 00:22:34.890
AUDIENCE: I expected that
you probably said they--

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:34.947
PATTON OSWALT: No.

00:22:34.947 --> 00:22:35.655
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:22:35.655 --> 00:22:37.570
AUDIENCE: Are there any
other products, toys,

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:39.070
from your childhood
that have helped

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:40.939
define who you are today?

00:22:40.939 --> 00:22:41.730
PATTON OSWALT: Wow.

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:48.100
Well, I mean
definitely stuff like,

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:49.790
anything you could
mess around with.

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:50.880
Anything you could modify.

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.490
So Legos.

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:55.530
Once, I remember after
"Star Wars" came out,

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:58.802
they had some special about
how they would do the effects

00:22:58.802 --> 00:23:00.760
and they would cannibalize
all these model kits

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.051
and build their own spaceships.

00:23:02.051 --> 00:23:04.730
So I would, you know, any
kind of stuff like that.

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:08.110
You know, a lot
of Play-Doh stuff.

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:08.850
Colorforms.

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:12.029
Anything where there's
a set base and then

00:23:12.029 --> 00:23:13.570
you can start messing
around with it.

00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:14.860
I love that.

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:15.985
I've always loved that, so.

00:23:15.985 --> 00:23:17.693
AUDIENCE: Hey man,
thanks for being here.

00:23:17.693 --> 00:23:18.735
PATTON OSWALT: Thank you.

00:23:18.735 --> 00:23:20.943
AUDIENCE: So you've done
stand up all over the world.

00:23:20.943 --> 00:23:23.000
I'm wondering, I know
you've done a lot of shows

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.541
in San Francisco,
if there's anything

00:23:24.541 --> 00:23:27.140
you think is unique
about the stand up scene

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:28.800
or the audience in the Bay Area?

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.832
Or if you have any good San
Francisco stand up stories.

00:23:31.832 --> 00:23:34.290
PATTON OSWALT: Well, I mean,
what's good about the audience

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:36.260
in San Francisco
is they don't, they

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:38.694
have the fewest expectations
for their performers

00:23:38.694 --> 00:23:40.360
of any other city
because there's always

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:43.460
been a tradition
of, let's see what

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:45.050
you, let's just
see something new.

00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:50.220
And really, was always very
open to experimental stuff.

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:54.410
God, I mean, there were so
many, there were so many,

00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:57.890
I mean, the biggest
for me was when

00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:00.970
comedy began collapsing again.

00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:01.840
It collapsed twice.

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.680
In the late '80s,
the boom ended.

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:06.510
And then in the mid '90s
is when it really died

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:09.074
and almost all the
clubs were gone.

00:24:09.074 --> 00:24:10.490
And the comedians
in San Francisco

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:13.500
just said, let's just
start our own rooms.

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:16.140
Let's just find a coffee
shop or a bookstore

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:18.000
and ask if we can
go do stand up.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.100
So that spirit of do
it any where you want.

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:24.460
And then that spirit
got taken down to LA

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:26.512
and that's where
the Largo started.

00:24:26.512 --> 00:24:28.220
In the early days of
the Largo, the Largo

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:31.460
started in a room called The
Onyx which was on Vermont.

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:35.220
And I mean, that was a room
where usually the audience

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:36.200
was just the comedians.

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:39.020
It was whoever was performing
and eight other people waiting

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:41.320
to go up in this
really over lit room.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.550
I remember these
white plastic chairs.

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:47.420
And one night it was me, Greg
Brenden, Bobcat Goldthwait,

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:49.940
Laura Kightlinger and
some other people.

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:51.500
I forget who else
was in the room.

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:52.750
But we start.

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:56.630
Somebody was onstage
doing a bit and this old,

00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:59.484
this much older
black guy came in

00:24:59.484 --> 00:25:00.900
and sat down in
one of the chairs.

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.125
And we're like, oh wow,
an actual audience member.

00:25:03.125 --> 00:25:05.000
Like, someone who's not
one of the comedians.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.440
And so then either I, whoever
was onstage, finished their set

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:09.590
and then sat back down.

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:12.770
And then when they sat
down, the black guy

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:16.656
got up and went to the
microphone and said,

00:25:16.656 --> 00:25:17.780
I forgot what his name was.

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:19.630
He goes, my name
is Dan and I would

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:22.190
like to get sober as well.

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:23.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:26.445
PATTON OSWALT: So he thought
it was like an AA meeting

00:25:26.445 --> 00:25:28.070
but we didn't register
what, we thought

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:29.930
it was like, oh, that's
like, kind of a funny-- I

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:31.638
think a couple people
might have laughed.

00:25:31.638 --> 00:25:36.602
Like, and then he like,
kind of was freaked out

00:25:36.602 --> 00:25:37.560
and then he walked out.

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:40.220
And then Bobcat was like, he
thought this was an AA meeting.

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:40.720
Oh no.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.370
And we all just laughed at him.

00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:44.860
And we ran out on Vermont
trying to find him and get him

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:47.410
to-- because all we thought
of is he must have been going,

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:50.530
now I'm really drinking.

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:52.767
So that was one of
those terrifying moments

00:25:52.767 --> 00:25:54.100
of, oh god, what did we just do?

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:54.933
What did we just do?

00:25:54.933 --> 00:25:55.500
So.

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:57.363
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:25:57.363 --> 00:25:58.689
PATTON OSWALT: Yeah.

00:25:58.689 --> 00:25:59.230
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:25:59.230 --> 00:25:59.980
PATTON OSWALT: Hi.

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:02.580
AUDIENCE: This is a downer
question too so I'm sorry.

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:03.080
When I--

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.538
PATTON OSWALT:
Hamster, yay or nay?

00:26:04.538 --> 00:26:05.280
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:08.060
When Robin Williams died and
you did the Watchmen quote,

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:10.070
"But Doctor, I am
Pagliacci," that

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:12.595
was like this real moment for
me where I was like, if I ever

00:26:12.595 --> 00:26:13.970
get to talk to
Patton Oswalt, I'm

00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:17.460
going to need him to stack
rank the three Robin Williams

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:20.240
comedies with pathos that
I watch when I'm sad.

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.410
So can you give me
"Good Morning, Vietnam,"

00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:25.020
"The Bird Cage," and "Mrs.
Doubtfire" in that order,

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:25.992
or in your order?

00:26:25.992 --> 00:26:27.116
PATTON OSWALT: In my order?

00:26:27.116 --> 00:26:27.810
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:29.870
PATTON OSWALT: "Birdcage" first.

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:40.490
And then, "Birdcage"
first, then "Good

00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:42.390
Morning Vietnam,"
then "Mrs. Doubtfire."

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:45.590
Although the two that I
watch of his that really kind

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:49.051
of-- especially because
they relate to him,

00:26:49.051 --> 00:26:50.550
from what I knew
of him near the end

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:53.600
because we were
friends near the end.

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.430
Which is, there's so much
pain involved with that.

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:59.100
But the two movies he
made, "The Fisher King"

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:02.490
and "Moscow on the Hudson"
because they were about,

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:04.360
you know "Moscow on
the Hudson" was about,

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:07.420
it's a stranger in a
completely strange land.

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:12.630
And it is just, it is
almost aggressive optimism

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:15.620
that gets him through this
everything that's against him.

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:19.910
And then "The Fisher King"
is he triumphs over madness.

00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:23.500
And I wish what he
got in "The Fisher

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:25.760
King" he had gotten
in real life.

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:28.540
But that, whatever that night
was that was chasing him,

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:31.760
finally chased him down and--
fuck, I'm bumming everyone out.

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:32.570
I'm so sorry.

00:27:35.121 --> 00:27:35.620
No, no.

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:36.010
Yeah.

00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:36.590
But yeah.

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:38.410
Those are the two
that I always go to.

00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:40.410
MALE SPEAKER: Continuing
on the suicidal theme--

00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:41.347
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:41.347 --> 00:27:42.180
PATTON OSWALT: What?

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:43.327
MALE SPEAKER: In--

00:27:43.327 --> 00:27:44.660
PATTON OSWALT: What's happening?

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:46.035
MALE SPEAKER: In
the cinema club,

00:27:46.035 --> 00:27:48.115
we have a category of
movie we call the go home

00:27:48.115 --> 00:27:50.030
and slit your wrist movies.

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:52.710
PATTON OSWALT: Jesus.

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:54.310
Any "Transformers" film?

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:55.812
I don't know.

00:27:55.812 --> 00:27:58.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:01.690
MALE SPEAKER: And you
can refresh your memory.

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:04.260
What's your favorite go home
and slit your wrist movie?

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:06.530
PATTON OSWALT: Jesus.

00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:07.430
What the hell?

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:09.779
I don't know.

00:28:09.779 --> 00:28:11.320
I mean, there's a
lot of great movies

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:14.810
that I would never watch again,
like "Letter to Zachary."

00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:17.550
Again, that's a, and
I'm not saying these

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:19.310
so that you'll go seek them out.

00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:22.590
You couldn't, if you get to the
end, that's one of those movies

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:24.947
that I'm like, I wish I
was on my deathbed years

00:28:24.947 --> 00:28:25.780
from now going, wow.

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:27.480
I never watched
"Letter to Zachary."

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:28.870
Thank goodness.

00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:30.299
That's a [GUNSHOT NOISE]

00:28:30.299 --> 00:28:32.340
MALE SPEAKER: We'll have
to add that to our list.

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:33.089
PATTON OSWALT: No.

00:28:33.089 --> 00:28:34.100
No.

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:38.240
"Irreversible," the Gaspar
Noe movie was just a, yeah,

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.960
life's horrible.

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:40.960
Life's fucking horrible.

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:48.990
The last, the little end title
card of "Camille Claudel"

00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:51.590
fills me with despair
for all of humanity.

00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:52.549
Like, screw everything.

00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:54.631
MALE SPEAKER: We've got
some good ideas here for--

00:28:54.631 --> 00:28:56.120
PATTON OSWALT: No, no.

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:57.390
Oh, I don't want to tell you.

00:28:57.390 --> 00:28:59.390
I have enough that makes
me want to kill myself.

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:01.310
I don't need to go
through the, movies

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:03.150
are where I escape that stuff.

00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:03.950
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:07.200
PATTON OSWALT: "Jack and
Jill," that would be the one.

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:07.700
,

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:09.574
AUDIENCE: Hi I promise
this isn't depressing.

00:29:09.574 --> 00:29:13.819
PATTON OSWALT: Please take us
out of this gloom, Mr. Fantasy.

00:29:13.819 --> 00:29:15.860
AUDIENCE: First of all,
thank you for being here.

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:17.374
PATTON OSWALT: No, guys, thanks.

00:29:17.374 --> 00:29:19.540
This is really flattering
to get invited to do this.

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:20.490
So thank you.

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:20.990
I'm serious.

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:22.168
Thank you very much.

00:29:22.168 --> 00:29:23.880
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.900
PATTON OSWALT: And
I got to, I got

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:27.530
to ride the little
Wonka bikes around.

00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:29.120
I was happy.

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.580
I rode a bike in
the sun and you're

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:31.955
like, which of
these movies would

00:29:31.955 --> 00:29:34.765
make you want to kill yourself?

00:29:34.765 --> 00:29:35.720
Jesus, god.

00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:41.710
AUDIENCE: I recall you
talking in one of your sets

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:45.030
about worrying that
a child of yours

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:46.650
would beat you and
your friends up

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:48.650
and toss your Blade
Runner gun on the roof.

00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:49.860
PATTON OSWALT: Yeah.

00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:52.020
AUDIENCE: It made me
wonder if in the years

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:55.030
after, you've actually managed
to collect any cool movie

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:55.940
props?

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:58.540
And if not, what props would
you want to get your hands on?

00:30:01.037 --> 00:30:02.620
PATTON OSWALT: This
is going to sound,

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:05.203
what I'm about to say is going
to make me sound way more noble

00:30:05.203 --> 00:30:06.100
than I am.

00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:08.860
But whenever I've gotten
my hands on movie props

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:11.497
or souvenirs, I
have friends who do

00:30:11.497 --> 00:30:13.830
charity auctions for different
charities I'm involved in

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:16.710
and I just don't
like saving trophies

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:18.460
or things from my past.

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:20.850
Because all it is
is, it just makes

00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:23.860
me dwell on that part rather
than the moving forward part.

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:26.660
So I don't want to, I
don't want to fill up

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:28.340
an office to look
like the bat cave.

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:32.400
I just don't want to, it's a
variation on that George Carlin

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.210
line, I don't want
to own a house

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:35.800
that I used to
scare people with.

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.480
I want a place where I can work.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:41.200
So every prop I've ever had, and
I've had some pretty cool ones,

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:44.100
I've said, hey, you know,
you can auction this off.

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:46.970
So usually they just go
right to-- I literally

00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:49.460
don't have any, I don't
have anything like that.

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:52.420
I mean, the stuff that I
collect is like an art work

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:55.620
by someone else, or
something that somebody made.

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:58.020
But it doesn't necessarily,
it doesn't deal with me.

00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:02.684
I have one, one of my show
posters hanging up in the house

00:31:02.684 --> 00:31:04.600
because I just love the
artwork on it so much.

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.183
But it's not because,
hey, look at me.

00:31:06.183 --> 00:31:08.680
It's like, I can't believe
that I got this artist who

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:10.950
I like so much to
do this poster.

00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:12.600
You know, that's
more about that.

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:13.882
AUDIENCE: That's so cool

00:31:13.882 --> 00:31:15.340
MALE SPEAKER: Which
movie was that?

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:16.673
PATTON OSWALT: It's not a movie.

00:31:16.673 --> 00:31:19.930
It's a show, it's a live show
for my second album taping.

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:25.287
There's this really cool poster
that this poster maker made

00:31:25.287 --> 00:31:26.870
that is just-- and
there's another one

00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:30.070
that I'm about to frame only
because it's Carnegie Hall

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:33.410
and because I got Ivan
Brunetti to do the artwork for.

00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:36.520
So that's also, that
was a big deal for me.

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.622
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:37.622 --> 00:31:40.164
PATTON OSWALT: Yeah,
you're welcome.

00:31:40.164 --> 00:31:40.830
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:42.670
PATTON OSWALT: Oh, I
remember you from lunch.

00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:43.460
AUDIENCE: We had a great lunch.

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:44.668
PATTON OSWALT: What the hell?

00:31:44.668 --> 00:31:46.490
I've already answered
your questions.

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:47.972
AUDIENCE: I have more, sir.

00:31:47.972 --> 00:31:51.250
So are there any classic
movies that you're

00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:53.212
embarrassed to say
you've never seen?

00:31:53.212 --> 00:31:54.170
PATTON OSWALT: Oh yeah.

00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:55.180
Oh my god.

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:57.915
AUDIENCE: And also, what was
your favorite film of 2014?

00:31:57.915 --> 00:32:00.040
PATTON OSWALT: Favorite
film of 2014 was "Boyhood."

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:00.832
Period.

00:32:00.832 --> 00:32:01.540
It was "Boyhood."

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:02.410
Amazing.

00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:04.960
It was amazing.

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.690
Classic movies I've
never seen, my god.

00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:09.440
There's-- before I say what
I'm going to say so you guys

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:11.740
don't go, what?

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:15.910
Every film buff has massive
gaps in their film knowledge.

00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:19.980
I have never seen a "Woman
Under the Influence."

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.980
Never seen "A
Raisin in the Sun."

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:24.130
Never seen "The Awful Truth."

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:27.460
I've never seen
"Risky Business."

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:28.640
What?

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:29.220
Yeah.

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:29.928
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:32:29.928 --> 00:32:31.290
I think we're done here.

00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:34.650
PATTON OSWALT: I've never seen,
never seen "Kramer vs Kramer."

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:35.640
Yeah.

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.220
So there's a lot of
like, again, it's

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:41.310
just for all the ones-- I just
recently saw "Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted

00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:43.250
&amp; Alice" and "Blume in Love."

00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:45.197
So there are movies
that you've just

00:32:45.197 --> 00:32:47.530
got to-- but I'm glad that
there's movies I haven't seen

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:50.500
that one day I will eventually
sit down and catch up with.

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:52.520
It's just the time
has got to be right.

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:53.550
So yeah.

00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:54.966
MALE SPEAKER: What
do you think is

00:32:54.966 --> 00:32:57.340
the most under-appreciated
period in the movies?

00:32:57.340 --> 00:33:00.090
And everybody talks about
the '70s being great but--

00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:02.590
PATTON OSWALT: That's
very appreciated.

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:05.420
I think a period that's
very under-appreciated,

00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:10.240
only in terms of specific
movies, was the post-noir,

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:16.430
pre-'60s, that whole
mid to late '50s period.

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:20.420
Only because the movies
really sucked then.

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:22.110
For the most part,
they were awful.

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:30.270
But there were smugglers like
Samuel Fuller and oh god,

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:35.810
who did "All that
Heaven Allows?"

00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:38.040
And oh come on.

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:41.810
He, they kind of remade his
whole style with that movie

00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:45.200
"Far from Heaven"
with Julianne Moore.

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:45.700
He did--

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:46.190
MALE SPEAKER:
Somebody out there?

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:48.570
PATTON OSWALT:
"Written on the Wind."

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:50.490
Huh?

00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:51.690
Douglas Sirk.

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:52.190
Yes.

00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:52.689
Thank you.

00:33:52.689 --> 00:33:55.500
Douglas Sirk, Nicholas
Ray, all the guys,

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.810
and even Frank Tashlin
in a very weird way.

00:33:57.810 --> 00:34:01.000
They couldn't overtly talk about
what they were talking about

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.430
so they had to sneak
all this stuff.

00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:05.080
So the smugglers
I really, really

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:06.624
liked all throughout the '50s.

00:34:06.624 --> 00:34:08.415
MALE SPEAKER: Even
Kubrick was around then.

00:34:08.415 --> 00:34:08.550
PATTON OSWALT: Hm?

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:09.750
MALE SPEAKER: Even
Kubrick was making movies.

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:11.208
PATTON OSWALT:
Kubrick, definitely.

00:34:11.208 --> 00:34:12.690
And yeah, they
were all, they all

00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:14.780
had to smuggle the
darker themes that they

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:16.760
wanted to cover
into these movies.

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:20.120
And then also people during
that time that didn't smuggle.

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:24.040
Someone like Ida Lupino
who was so punk rock.

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:28.280
She was this
gorgeous lead actress

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:29.590
that Paramount like, dumped.

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:31.159
And she said, screw it.

00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:33.575
I'll just form my own film
company and make my own movies.

00:34:33.575 --> 00:34:36.235
And made these totally
independent movies

00:34:36.235 --> 00:34:38.110
about whatever she wanted
to make them about.

00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:39.651
And they were so
ahead of their time.

00:34:39.651 --> 00:34:41.350
And she had to
distribute them herself

00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:43.050
and they're just amazing.

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:46.489
And so she was likee--
you got all the smugglers

00:34:46.489 --> 00:34:48.739
and then you've always got
the one person that's like,

00:34:48.739 --> 00:34:50.590
I'm not smuggling for anybody.

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:53.100
And it was Ida Lupino
who just kicked ass.

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:54.980
MALE SPEAKER: What were
some of her movies?

00:34:54.980 --> 00:35:02.420
PATTON OSWALT: "The Outrage,"
"The Hitchhiker," you've

00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:03.550
got to go look her up.

00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:05.290
You know, she was in
a lot of great noirs

00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:08.020
like, "On Dangerous
Ground" and then

00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:09.772
she formed a company
called The Filmmakers

00:35:09.772 --> 00:35:10.980
and they just made their own.

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:14.682
"The Outrage" is about
a girl who gets raped.

00:35:14.682 --> 00:35:16.640
And it's very, it's not
explicit about the rape

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:18.970
but it's explicit about
how everyone in the town

00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:20.120
is kind of blaming her.

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:23.340
Like, why were-- and it's
like, this is done in the '50s.

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:27.300
Like this is almost like a
"Salon" or "Jezebel" article

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:30.474
now that she was making in the
'50s, that people we're like,

00:35:30.474 --> 00:35:32.140
you don't talk about
this kind of stuff.

00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:34.620
She goes, I'll do it.

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:36.400
So it's just, it's amazing.

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.715
She is so under appreciated.

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:41.320
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:42.330
Thank you for coming.

00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:45.330
I just wanted to mention, one of
my favorite characters of yours

00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:47.890
is Dungeon Master
from "Reno 911."

00:35:47.890 --> 00:35:49.610
PATTON OSWALT: Oh, thank you.

00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:50.942
That was a fun one to do.

00:35:50.942 --> 00:35:52.733
AUDIENCE: I was just
curious, have you ever

00:35:52.733 --> 00:35:55.110
been tempted to go to a
Comic-Con dressed as a Dungeon

00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:57.165
Master and see how people react?

00:35:57.165 --> 00:35:58.540
PATTON OSWALT:
See, I almost feel

00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:02.330
like if I went in a costume,
I wouldn't be recognized.

00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:04.990
Like I, there's a
story and I don't know.

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:09.710
I can't get this confirmed but
I hosted some panels one year.

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:11.335
I moderated some Q and A's.

00:36:11.335 --> 00:36:12.460
I've done what you've done.

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:18.900
And I did one with Tim Burton
for "Alice in Wonderland"

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:20.840
and Johnny Depp walked
out as a surprise

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.210
and we talked for a bit.

00:36:22.210 --> 00:36:24.470
And then we were backstage,
this is at San Diego.

00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:28.250
Were in Hall H and we're back
in the green room and Johnny

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:30.550
goes-- Johnny, like I know him.

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:33.875
Johnny Depp says, I'd like
to walk around on that floor

00:36:33.875 --> 00:36:35.130
and look at stuff.

00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:37.250
And his handler was
like, you can't.

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:37.765
You can't.

00:36:37.765 --> 00:36:39.140
You can't walk
around down there.

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:41.010
You know what's going to happen.

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:45.090
And the rumor is that he
got one of his assistants

00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:48.880
to go to one of those
Halloween costume warehouses

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:52.370
that's open year round and
just get a cheap Jack Sparrow

00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:55.997
costume he just threw on
and then he walked around

00:36:55.997 --> 00:36:58.245
and people were like,
look at this asshole.

00:36:58.245 --> 00:37:00.299
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:00.299 --> 00:37:02.340
PATTON OSWALT: He kind of
looks like Johnny Depp.

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:05.799
Because there's guys
that really go all out

00:37:05.799 --> 00:37:06.840
and do the whole costume.

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:10.202
And they're like, this dick
just took that out of a bag.

00:37:10.202 --> 00:37:12.510
And literally
nobody bothered him.

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:14.180
No one looked at him twice.

00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:15.830
Because there's 900
of them down there.

00:37:18.625 --> 00:37:19.500
AUDIENCE: Hey Patton.

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:19.790
PATTON OSWALT: Hey.

00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:20.560
AUDIENCE: Thanks for being here.

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:21.260
Love your work.

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:22.800
PATTON OSWALT: Thank you.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.080
AUDIENCE: I'm curious
to know your sort

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.590
of comedy-writing process.

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:29.330
Like, what's your sort
of starting point?

00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:32.060
And if you have any
advice for young writers,

00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:33.000
that would be helpful.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.350
PATTON OSWALT: Like
a young comedy writer

00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:35.480
or a young comedian, or?

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:37.117
AUDIENCE: Comedians,
comedy writers.

00:37:37.117 --> 00:37:38.950
PATTON OSWALT: I mean,
unfortunately for me,

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:41.530
I wish I could say
that I sat and wrote.

00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:45.410
But my method has always been
that I have the germ of an idea

00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:47.970
and if it stays in my head
and keeps nagging at me,

00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:50.190
I know that that's the
beginning of a bit.

00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:52.710
And then I just go onstage
over and over again and form it

00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:54.050
in real time.

00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:56.050
And I over form it
and then I chip away

00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:58.285
until it's right
where it needs to be.

00:37:58.285 --> 00:38:00.160
I wish I could tell you
that I sat and wrote.

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:00.920
I just don't.

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:04.600
I don't have that, that's the
one undisciplined part of me,

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:06.651
as far as the stand
up is concerned.

00:38:06.651 --> 00:38:08.650
But if I'm writing a book,
then I'll write like,

00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:10.932
OK, I got to write
three pages a day.

00:38:10.932 --> 00:38:12.640
And I treat writing
like it's a thing you

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:15.150
get to do rather than
a think you have to do.

00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:18.350
So I don't open up a nine-hour
block of time to write.

00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:20.000
I go, you've only
got two hours so

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.852
let's really have fun with
this and make the best of it.

00:38:22.852 --> 00:38:23.560
AUDIENCE: Gotcha.

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:24.240
Thank you.

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:24.700
PATTON OSWALT: Yeah, thank you.

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:26.040
AUDIENCE: Do some of
the other comedians

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:27.040
sit down and write things?

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:27.840
PATTON OSWALT: Oh, absolutely.

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:28.450
Yeah.

00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:30.116
Some of them are very,
very disciplined.

00:38:30.116 --> 00:38:32.850
I'm just not one of
them on those terms.

00:38:32.850 --> 00:38:35.220
I wish I was.

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:36.470
AUDIENCE: Hey, how's it going?

00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:36.880
PATTON OSWALT: Good.

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.290
AUDIENCE: I grew up
watching "King of Queens"

00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:39.900
and I thought you were
really funny in it.

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:40.760
PATTON OSWALT: Thank you.

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:42.718
AUDIENCE: You also look
exactly the same today,

00:38:42.718 --> 00:38:43.710
which is impressive.

00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:44.626
PATTON OSWALT: Thanks?

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:53.533
I was a fat nerd on that show.

00:38:53.533 --> 00:38:54.515
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:56.252 --> 00:38:58.210
MALE SPEAKER: As opposed
to a taekwondo master.

00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:01.070
AUDIENCE: My question is,
I notice a lot of comedians

00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:03.400
tend to be atheists
and I was wondering

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:04.612
if you believe in God?

00:39:04.612 --> 00:39:05.570
PATTON OSWALT: I don't.

00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:08.420
I'm an atheist.

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:09.700
Do a one-nighter in Wichita.

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:11.438
You will not believe in God.

00:39:11.438 --> 00:39:14.037
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:14.037 --> 00:39:16.370
PATTON OSWALT: I'm an atheist
but I'm an atheist the way

00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:20.439
that like, I feel about
people like Bill Maher

00:39:20.439 --> 00:39:22.230
and Richard Dawkins
the way that Christians

00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:24.500
feel about the Westboro
Baptist Church.

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:25.920
Like, I wish they
would just calm

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:28.640
the fuck down a little bit.

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:30.829
Because atheism,
what it means is,

00:39:30.829 --> 00:39:33.370
anyone else can believe-- I'm
not trying to destroy religion.

00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:35.100
I just don't believe in it.

00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:38.330
I think that religion is
beautiful in that it's

00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:41.177
somebody making up a
story to help them live.

00:39:41.177 --> 00:39:42.760
But I don't think
there was an actual,

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:44.718
I don't think there was
a God before the story.

00:39:44.718 --> 00:39:48.020
I think somebody made up this
beautiful, elaborate story,

00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:50.751
full of gods and monsters
and it helps to guide them.

00:39:50.751 --> 00:39:51.250
That's fine.

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:53.120
I just don't use that story.

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:55.680
You know, but if it helps
someone, I don't care.

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:59.310
And all these guys like Bill
Maher and again, Bill Maher

00:39:59.310 --> 00:40:03.170
and Richard Dawkins, and Sam
Harris are always saying,

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:06.617
but religion causes these wars.

00:40:06.617 --> 00:40:08.200
Anyone who says that
about religion is

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:13.560
no different than the
dumpy Midwestern housewife

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:17.150
that atheists make fun of who
says, this Judas Priest album

00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:18.450
made my son kill himself.

00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:19.350
No.

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:21.930
These people that started
wars because of religion were

00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:23.140
lunatics . anyway.

00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:24.900
Anything would have
made them do it.

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:27.550
It was just nice that
religion came along.

00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:31.260
But if it wasn't for Islam,
or Christianity, or Judaism,

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:33.872
or Hinduism, they would have
looked at a weird shape pine

00:40:33.872 --> 00:40:37.015
cone and went, I got
to kill everybody.

00:40:37.015 --> 00:40:38.920
Because they're crazy.

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:42.485
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:42.485 --> 00:40:43.360
PATTON OSWALT: There.

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:44.680
Thank you.

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:46.220
Go ahead.

00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:47.384
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:40:47.384 --> 00:40:48.800
We know that you're
a big film fan

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:51.277
and that you really probably
have a lot of people

00:40:51.277 --> 00:40:52.860
that you admire that
maybe you've met.

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:54.200
I was wondering
if you could think

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:56.800
of a particular like, geek-out
moment where you just couldn't

00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.570
contain yourself
around somebody?

00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:00.736
PATTON OSWALT: Oh yeah, I
was telling this at lunch.

00:41:00.736 --> 00:41:01.760
Werner Herzog.

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:06.890
I did some short films for this
thing called "We the Economy"

00:41:06.890 --> 00:41:09.222
explaining the economy
and mine was directed

00:41:09.222 --> 00:41:11.680
by Ramin Bahrani, who was also,
that was a big deal for me.

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:13.140
He's one of my
favorite directors.

00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:15.720
And so right till the
day before shooting

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:18.530
it was supposed to be
me and then at the end,

00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:20.860
I play a guy who runs a
lemonade stand that I'm

00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:24.610
trying to shut down this little
girl's lemonade stand using

00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:26.824
regulate, called
regulatory capture.

00:41:26.824 --> 00:41:27.740
It's this whole thing.

00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:30.930
So and then in the
original script,

00:41:30.930 --> 00:41:32.930
they had David
Hasselhoff was going

00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:35.640
to come up on a, what
are those scooters that--

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:37.120
AUDIENCE: Razor scooters.

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:39.030
PATTON OSWALT: Not a
razor, the other one.

00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:39.990
Segway.

00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:41.490
And yell at me.

00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:44.450
And then he had to drop out
so they got Werner Herzog.

00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:46.590
Or as my friend
said, so you lost

00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:48.200
Germany's favorite
American but you

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:50.986
got America's favorite German.

00:41:50.986 --> 00:41:53.610
And he did a scene where he was
screaming at me and calling me,

00:41:53.610 --> 00:41:54.165
you're vile.

00:41:54.165 --> 00:41:55.512
You're a worm.

00:41:55.512 --> 00:41:57.220
And they had to shoot
it over my shoulder

00:41:57.220 --> 00:41:59.595
because I was supposed to be
hurt but I was just smiling.

00:41:59.595 --> 00:42:02.472
I was so happy to get
to have him yell at me.

00:42:02.472 --> 00:42:03.680
I just was in such good mood.

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:05.340
That was a big deal
to meet that guy.

00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:06.090
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:06.840
Thank you.

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:09.195
PATTON OSWALT: You're welcome.

00:42:09.195 --> 00:42:10.070
AUDIENCE: Hey Patton.

00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:10.570
Big fan.

00:42:10.570 --> 00:42:11.611
PATTON OSWALT: Thank you.

00:42:11.611 --> 00:42:13.510
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
so I like to joke

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:16.320
around a lot with
arguable success

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:18.428
at actually being funny.

00:42:18.428 --> 00:42:20.053
And the one thing I
kind of want to try

00:42:20.053 --> 00:42:22.380
is translating that to the
stage and doing stand up.

00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:24.470
I'm wondering if
you have any advice

00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:26.470
on how to make that transition?

00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:28.390
Because you know,
jesting with friends

00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:30.989
is very different than
actually being on the spot.

00:42:30.989 --> 00:42:33.030
PATTON OSWALT: Do you live
in, where do you live?

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:34.680
PATTON OSWALT: San Francisco.

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:35.844
Go onstage.

00:42:35.844 --> 00:42:37.510
And I'm not saying
this to blow you off.

00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:39.320
People ask me this
question all the time

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:40.890
and it's not a
blow off question.

00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:42.760
Find the stage and go on it.

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:44.137
It is the simplest thing.

00:42:44.137 --> 00:42:45.720
Any other thing you
got to try, you've

00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:47.780
got to convince other
people to go along with you.

00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:48.570
Stand up, all
you've got to do is

00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:50.111
show up and go on
stage for a minute.

00:42:50.111 --> 00:42:50.621
Its free.

00:42:50.621 --> 00:42:52.120
There's a million,
in San Francisco,

00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:53.570
there's a million open mics.

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:54.930
Start going onstage.

00:42:54.930 --> 00:42:55.949
It'll suck.

00:42:55.949 --> 00:42:58.240
But show up again, it'll suck
less, and less, and less,

00:42:58.240 --> 00:42:58.610
and less.

00:42:58.610 --> 00:42:59.700
Then you'll be good at it.

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:00.280
AUDIENCE: Will do.

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:00.780
Thanks.

00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:03.090
PATTON OSWALT: All
right, man, Good luck.

00:43:03.090 --> 00:43:03.970
AUDIENCE: Hey, thanks
for being here.

00:43:03.970 --> 00:43:04.240
PATTON OSWALT: Thank you.

00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:06.240
AUDIENCE: I just want to
say one of my favorites

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:07.842
skits was Black
Angus Steakhouse.

00:43:07.842 --> 00:43:08.800
PATTON OSWALT: Oh, wow.

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:09.430
Thank you.

00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:09.760
AUDIENCE: Still.

00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:11.180
I still think that's hysterical.

00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:12.510
A quick question, I'm not
sure if it's in the book

00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:14.976
but when you talk about sort
of appreciating films and all

00:43:14.976 --> 00:43:17.101
the films you've seen and
what you like or dislike,

00:43:17.101 --> 00:43:19.694
does animated films
fall into that category?

00:43:19.694 --> 00:43:21.110
Just curious to
get your thoughts.

00:43:21.110 --> 00:43:22.193
PATTON OSWALT: Absolutely.

00:43:22.193 --> 00:43:24.890
I mean, to me, I don't
look at any kind of like,

00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:27.390
genre as this is the
genre of good films.

00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:29.530
I mean, I think that
there are great films that

00:43:29.530 --> 00:43:31.910
are horror films, great
films that are animated.

00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:35.340
So yeah, animated movies I
think have been just as crucial

00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:37.012
in film history as any other.

00:43:37.012 --> 00:43:39.470
I mean, if you go back to "Snow
White and the Seven Dwarfs"

00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:40.880
and "Fantasia."

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:43.720
Or if you then look
at now, animated films

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:45.970
have gone the same
way as mainstream.

00:43:45.970 --> 00:43:49.720
There's indie versions of it
with movies like "Persepolis."

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:53.090
There's all of
Miyazaki's stuff has

00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:56.090
been-- Miyazaki's films
have influenced Pixar

00:43:56.090 --> 00:43:57.910
more than Disney's films have.

00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:59.930
So you know, I
just think that, I

00:43:59.930 --> 00:44:04.639
don't look at movies in terms
of those kind of genres.

00:44:04.639 --> 00:44:06.430
Like, I'm glad there's
a Best Animated Film

00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:09.054
category in the Oscars but there
have been a couple years where

00:44:09.054 --> 00:44:11.640
I'm like, some of these
movies could be Best Picture

00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:14.052
compared to what's in the
Best Picture category.

00:44:14.052 --> 00:44:15.010
AUDIENCE: Cool, thanks.

00:44:15.010 --> 00:44:15.740
PATTON OSWALT: Thank you.

00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:17.823
MALE SPEAKER: Same for
Best Foreign Film actually.

00:44:17.823 --> 00:44:19.390
There have been
some years when--

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:20.950
PATTON OSWALT: Oh
yeah, that's right.

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:21.910
Yeah.

00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:22.910
That's right.

00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:24.285
MALE SPEAKER: Not
usually though.

00:44:24.285 --> 00:44:27.070
Frequently they're
crappy movies that the--

00:44:27.070 --> 00:44:31.050
PATTON OSWALT: Lets not open
that door, for God's sakes.

00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:32.050
MALE SPEAKER: Go ahead.

00:44:32.050 --> 00:44:33.800
AUDIENCE: Five, it's
an honor to have you.

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:34.550
Thank you.

00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:36.110
PATTON OSWALT: Thank you.

00:44:36.110 --> 00:44:39.660
AUDIENCE: I'd like to--
what is your preferred

00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:42.530
level of fame and
recognizability?

00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:44.531
Because there's at
different times,

00:44:44.531 --> 00:44:46.655
I mention you to different
people and they're like,

00:44:46.655 --> 00:44:49.250
oh, I know who Patton
Oswalt is versus who is he?

00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:50.800
Oh, you'll have to
show me a video.

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:53.382
Versus oh, he was that
role in that show.

00:44:53.382 --> 00:44:54.590
There's all different levels.

00:44:54.590 --> 00:44:56.950
And like, what level are
you most comfortable with?

00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:59.698
MALE SPEAKER: Eventually it's,
we want a young Patton Oswalt.

00:44:59.698 --> 00:45:01.597
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:01.597 --> 00:45:02.430
MALE SPEAKER: Sorry.

00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:03.410
That's a classic Hollywood line.

00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:03.820
PATTON OSWALT: No, that it is.

00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:04.430
Yeah.

00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:08.180
We want a physically
fit Patton Oswalt.

00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:12.610
I would say my
level of fame is, I

00:45:12.610 --> 00:45:16.120
think the preferred
fame is, can sometimes

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:18.410
get a good seat at
a restaurant if it's

00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:20.470
crowded but nothing above that.

00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:22.557
So I can still travel
internationally

00:45:22.557 --> 00:45:23.640
and no one knows who I am.

00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:25.570
Like that's, I
don't want to go--

00:45:25.570 --> 00:45:28.410
I mean I've seen really
high levels of fame

00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:30.715
and they're just not, and
this is going to sound like,

00:45:30.715 --> 00:45:31.590
it's not sour grapes.

00:45:31.590 --> 00:45:33.160
But they don't look fun.

00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:34.660
There's certain levels.

00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:38.054
There's a lot of nervousness
that I have around people

00:45:38.054 --> 00:45:39.720
and sometimes it can
get a little weird.

00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:43.200
So I can't imagine what somebody
like a Tom Hanks goes through.

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:45.530
Like, especially because I
want to keep doing stand up

00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:47.970
and if I get to a point
where I have to be walled off

00:45:47.970 --> 00:45:51.640
from everyday life, then
it'll affect me doing comedy.

00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:54.590
I won't be able to
walk around anymore.

00:45:54.590 --> 00:45:56.050
So I'm right where I want to be.

00:45:56.050 --> 00:45:57.070
This is perfect.

00:45:57.070 --> 00:46:00.030
No more.

00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:02.910
I've got to lose weight.

00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:04.259
Go ahead.

00:46:04.259 --> 00:46:05.550
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming.

00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:07.090
PATTON OSWALT:
Thanks for having me.

00:46:07.090 --> 00:46:08.548
AUDIENCE: I just
wanted to ask you,

00:46:08.548 --> 00:46:11.820
when do you feel like you
stop bombing in comedy?

00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:12.890
Or if you never stoped--

00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:13.910
PATTON OSWALT:
I've never stopped.

00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:15.220
I still-- there are nights.

00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:17.620
I just did the Improv
the other night,

00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:20.332
like last Sun-- wait a minute.

00:46:20.332 --> 00:46:21.360
It was last Saturday.

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:23.526
I didn't have a good, I was
trying out all new stuff

00:46:23.526 --> 00:46:24.490
and I ate it.

00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:25.390
It just, it happens.

00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:27.390
I mean, it was a
little open mic thingy

00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:30.890
but you're never immune
from having a bad set.

00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:32.410
Everyone has bad sets.

00:46:32.410 --> 00:46:35.510
But the thing is
you're not immune,

00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:39.135
you have to become immune
to the fear of them.

00:46:39.135 --> 00:46:41.200
And also got to become
immune to good sets

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:42.740
too because there's
a lot of people,

00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:45.057
a really good set can mess
you up as hard as a bad set.

00:46:45.057 --> 00:46:46.640
People have a really
good set and they

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:48.848
walk around going, wow, that
just changed everything.

00:46:48.848 --> 00:46:49.889
It's like, no.

00:46:49.889 --> 00:46:52.430
Tomorrow's a new day and you've
got to start from zero again.

00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:54.340
Like it's just,
just keep going up.

00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:56.380
So you know, it's
that kind of-- there

00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:58.457
will always be
times when I bomb.

00:46:58.457 --> 00:46:59.290
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:00.540
PATTON OSWALT: You're welcome.

00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:03.200
Hello.

00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:05.366
AUDIENCE: You talked about
wanting to be a director.

00:47:05.366 --> 00:47:07.054
Do you think your
directorial debut will

00:47:07.054 --> 00:47:08.970
be your long-awaited
companion piece to "Death

00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:10.933
Bed: The Bed That Eats People?"

00:47:10.933 --> 00:47:11.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:14.050
PATTON OSWALT: God, I hope not.

00:47:14.050 --> 00:47:14.890
Yeah.

00:47:14.890 --> 00:47:15.390
No.

00:47:15.390 --> 00:47:16.880
That was, good lord.

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:17.380
No.

00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:18.296
That was a throw away.

00:47:18.296 --> 00:47:20.470
That was more of a
joke about making fun

00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:22.490
of why can't you
get something done.

00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:25.070
You know, for all the
movies, all the screenplays

00:47:25.070 --> 00:47:27.130
I've completed that
haven't been made.

00:47:27.130 --> 00:47:29.380
For all the screenplays I
started and didn't complete.

00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:32.550
And a guy came up with
"Death Bed" and got it done.

00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:36.180
So there's no excuse for you
not to finish your movie.

00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:38.390
So no It will, god, I hope not.

00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.890
Oh boy.

00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:41.032
That would be depressing.

00:47:41.032 --> 00:47:41.740
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:43.362
PATTON OSWALT: Yeah, thank you.

00:47:43.362 --> 00:47:44.070
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:47.780
We're going to have book
signing in the back.

00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:50.050
And do you have a show tonight
at Berkeley, I believe.

00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:52.305
PATTON OSWALT: The
Zellerbach in Berkeley, so.

00:47:52.305 --> 00:47:55.550
MALE SPEAKER: You all can catch
even more of Patton tonight.

00:47:55.550 --> 00:47:57.374
Let's thank Patton
Oswalt for coming here.

00:47:57.374 --> 00:47:58.540
PATTON OSWALT: Thanks, guys.

00:47:58.540 --> 00:47:59.440
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:00.481
PATTON OSWALT: Thank you.

00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:03.640
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:08.190
[MUSIC PLAYING]
