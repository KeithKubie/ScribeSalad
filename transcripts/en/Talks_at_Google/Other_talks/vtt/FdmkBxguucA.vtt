&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: My name is Steve Grove.
I'm the Head of News and Politics at YouTube

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.610
and it's my pleasure to welcome today, Anderson
Cooper.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.829
[applause and cheering]
&gt;&gt;Anderson Cooper: Alright. Yep.

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:16.049
&gt;&gt;Steve: Welcome. It's good to see you.

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.551
&gt;&gt;Anderson Cooper: Thanks.

00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:18.551
&gt;&gt;Steve: Thanks for joining us.

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:20.641
&gt;&gt;Anderson Cooper: I love that you have to
tell people to put away their laptops.

00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:22.080
&gt;&gt;Steve: That's a very Google thing.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.290
&gt;&gt;Anderson Cooper: It's a very Google--. Don't
you all have work to do? What the hell are

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.420
you all doing here?

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.420
[laughter]

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.590
&gt;&gt;Steve: You've actually torn people away,
but not really 'cause they brought their laptops.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.929
&gt;&gt;Anderson Cooper: I appreciate it. I hope
the whole company hasn't come to a halt. I

00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:33.929
feel like--.

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:35.810
&gt;&gt;Steve: Well, we'll see. Productivity is
definitely going down right now.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.920
&gt;&gt;Anderson Cooper: That's right. OK. Sergey
Brin is screaming.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:38.920
&gt;&gt;Steve: Well, welcome.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.920
&gt;&gt;Anderson Cooper: Thanks. Yeah, it's good
to be here.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:40.920
&gt;&gt;Steve: Have you ever been here before?

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.760
&gt;&gt;Anderson Cooper: I have not. No. I mean,
I've gone to Chelsea Markets. So, I've been

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.760
near here.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.760
&gt;&gt;Steve: Not the office.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.760
&gt;&gt;Anderson Cooper: No, not the office itself.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.760
&gt;&gt;Steve: But you've been a friend of YouTube
for--

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.159
&gt;&gt;Anderson Cooper: But you also--. I work
in news where everybody is like, grizzled

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:56.070
and unhealthy. And you all look like young
and fresh and happy, which is very odd.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.100
[laughter]

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.691
Working in cable news, it's odd to see that.

00:00:58.691 --> 00:01:01.410
&gt;&gt;Steve: I'm guessing the mean age here is
lower than over at--.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.750
&gt;&gt;Anderson Cooper: I think so, yeah. And on
my daytime show, you're about the mean age,

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.590
but at news, yeah. We have a lot more grizzled
vets.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.590
&gt;&gt;Steve: Well tell us about that. So, you're
starting a talk show on television.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.840
&gt;&gt;Anderson Cooper: I am. I'm starting a daytime
talk show. So, yeah. I mean, I'm staying at

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.320
CNN and I'll continue to do that at night.
But I'm starting a talk show that goes on

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.490
the air September 12th.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.530
&gt;&gt;Steve: And what's it about? What's your
focus?

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.590
&gt;&gt;Anderson Cooper: Well, it's a daytime talk
show, so it's really a variety of things.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.500
It's a show which one day will have a big
celebrity interview, the next day will have

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.980
a provocative social issue, the next day it'll
be some pop culture stuff, which I'm addicted

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.240
to pop culture in addition to that.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.240
&gt;&gt;Steve: Really?

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.240
&gt;&gt;Anderson Cooper: Yeah.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.240
&gt;&gt;Steve: You're addicted to pop culture?

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.240
&gt;&gt;Anderson Cooper: I am. Yeah. I watch--

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.240
&gt;&gt;Steve: I thought you were a news guy.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.340
&gt;&gt;Anderson Cooper: I am a news guy, but I
watch nonstop television and I have since--.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.750
I literally recently found my TV viewing schedule
that I made for myself when I was in 4th grade.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.750
[laughter]

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.700
And from the moment I got home at 3:30 or
whatever it was, I had blocked out in 30-minute

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.590
increments. And I allowed like, 15 minutes
for dinner with my family, which tell you

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.780
a little bit something about my home life.
And I allowed 15 minutes for homework.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.250
[laughter]

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.170
Which, in 4th grade, it was acceptable. But
yeah, I--

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.170
&gt;&gt;Steve: You had a TV schedule.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.170
&gt;&gt;Anderson Cooper: A TV schedule.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.170
&gt;&gt;Steve: Any pop culture stuff?

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.580
&gt;&gt;Anderson Cooper: Magilla Gorilla starting
at 3:30 and then it went The Andy Griffith

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.020
Show. All sorts of things, yeah.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.870
&gt;&gt;Steve: Wow. So this isn't uncharted territory.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:30.120
&gt;&gt;Anderson Cooper: Yeah. I mean, I literally
watch tons of just cheesy reality TV shows.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.370
I watch The Soup to catch the shows that I've
missed.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.370
[laughter]

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.561
And I watch Tosh.0 to catch-up on the web
stuff that I'm missing. So, I feel like I

00:02:38.561 --> 00:02:39.850
have all my bases covered.

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.440
&gt;&gt;Steve: What's your favorite pop culture
show on TV?

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:48.640
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Oh, man. I go through phases.
I was an early admirer of the Atlanta Housewives.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.720
Perhaps you've seen their work?

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.720
[laughter]

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.720
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: I missed that one.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.720
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Really?

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.720
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Yeah, I'm ashamed to say.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.720
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Anyone here seen it?

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.720
[laughter]

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.620
Yeah, all right. Good. Sure. Say it proudly.
Don't be afraid.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.620
[laughter]

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.640
But I've moved on. I'm now the Beverly Hills
ladies. They got me. So, yes.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.640
[whooping]

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.790
Yes, thank you. Thank you for sharing that
with me.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:09.790
[laughter]

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.280
And yeah. So, I watch the Beverly Hills Housewives.
I feel like Bravo schedules the Housewives

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.700
back to back so much that emotionally, I need
a little bit of a break. So, I actually have

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.910
DVR'd the New Jersey Housewives because I
feel like I'm not really ready for them yet.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:24.910
[laughter]

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:25.910
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: I see, I see.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:26.910
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: But I'm saving up for a
rainy day.

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.060
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Well, maybe you can watch some
of the clips on YouTube if you miss them during

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.060
the day.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.500
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: That's right. I also watch
drama. I'm a big addict to Breaking Bad and

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.660
The Killing, although the last episode I was
very angry about. But yeah, I watch a lot

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.660
of stuff.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.660
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: You're no stranger to YouTube.
You and I met back in '07 when we did the

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:44.660
CNN YouTube debates.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.660
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: That's right.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.670
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Where you moderated a couple
debates with citizen questions from YouTube.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:48.670
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Which was cool.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:49.890
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: And last week--

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.250
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: I'm not sure the Republican
candidates liked it as much as the Democratic

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.250
candidates.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.160
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: No, no. They weren't as happy
about the snowman-like questions.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.420
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: They didn't like the snow--.
Yes, that's right. Yes.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.180
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: But it was pivotal. There were
definitely moments. Back then it was, of course,

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.010
"Oh my God, social media in a debate."

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.010
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Right.

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.970
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Now, it's like every debate
has these sorts of aspects to it.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.140
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Yeah. No, it's interesting.
It's--. Obviously, it's been a sea change.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.890
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Last week, you had probably
you're biggest YouTube moment ever.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:14.890
[laughter]

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.199
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: I have no idea what you're
talking about.

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:21.970
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: I hate to do this to you, Anderson,
but we have to just remind our viewing audience

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:22.970
here.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:23.970
[applause]

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:24.970
[plays clip]

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.120
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: All I can say is they should
thank their lucky stars it wasn't Depar-Two.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:35.669
Sorry. That made me giggle every time I read
it. He hasn't commented on this incident.

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:36.669
[A laughs uncontrollably]

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:37.669
Depar-Two. I know you got it, but.

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:38.669
[A laughs uncontrollably]

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:51.460
This is the worst part coming up. So bad.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:05:00.651
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: This is live on the air.

00:05:00.651 --> 00:05:01.651
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Yeah.

00:05:01.651 --> 00:05:02.651
[laughter]

00:05:02.651 --> 00:05:04.000
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: All right. Well, we'll spare
you.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.199
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Sorry, this has actually
never happened to me. But we'll see this whole

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:11.910
thing on YouTube and you [inaudible].

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.340
[applause]

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:20.500
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: So, what happened?

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:27.880
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Every time I read it, I
was reading it and stuff and I'd been tweaking

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.400
the writing and stuff. And then, I don't know.
It just made me giggle every time and I have

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.030
always giggled like a 13-year old girl meeting
Justin Beiber at a meet and greet.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.960
[laughter]

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.450
But I've usually been able to control it or
stop it. I just, I've never been in a situation--.

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.150
You see these people on YouTube or elsewhere
doing this and you think, "I'd be able to

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.100
do something about it." I could not do anything
about it.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.100
[laughter]

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.100
True.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.100
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Your show is taped late on
the West Coast and you're on a second hour

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.540
later. Were you tempted to cut that out?

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.979
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Well, it's funny. As soon
as this happened and then we're off the air,

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:04.150
I said to my producer 'cause I was--. That
was at 8 o'clock and my show was gonna be

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:09.210
repeated at 10. And I said, "We can just pull
that up for the 10 o'clock." And there was

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.820
silence. I said that out there and there was
silence in my ear on the IFB and they were

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.420
like, "Oh no, no, no, no, no."

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:15.420
[laughter]

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:16.420
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: That's staying.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.280
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: "We are not pulling that
up at all." So, it was fine by me.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.690
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Yeah, you're a good sport about
it.

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:28.120
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Totally. I mean, I make
fun of myself more than anything else.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.326
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Well, you've launched a YouTube
channel--I've just pulled it up here--for

00:06:30.326 --> 00:06:31.326
the talk show.

00:06:31.326 --> 00:06:32.326
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Mm-hmm.

00:06:32.326 --> 00:06:33.510
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: You've been posting videos
and taking questions. Some of those we'll

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:37.650
get to in a moment. I wanted to just play
an example of a way that you've been using

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.210
YouTube to get audiences excited about the
show.

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:41.460
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Right.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.710
[plays video clip]

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.720
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: atrightontime123. How do
people come up with these names? OK. atrightontime123.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.653
"Hey I can't wait for the new show." Thank
you. "My question is this, what was the last

00:06:50.653 --> 00:06:56.580
song that got stuck in your head?" Umm, hmm,
it's really just embarrassing.

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:06.400
I can't believe I'm gonna say this. Rebecca
Black. Terrible. It's really bad. But that

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:12.180
stupid song, it got stuck in my head. Like,
I was late to the whole Rebecca Black thing

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:21.460
and once I saw it, I mean, it was just mind-bogglingly
bad, but I find myself doing, "It's Friday,

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:22.460
Friday."

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:23.460
[laughter]

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:29.139
I don't even know the words. I just sang that
stupid thing in my head. And then I heard

00:07:29.139 --> 00:07:34.995
she was--. I was listening to BBC radio over
the weekend and there was some Katy Perry

00:07:34.995 --> 00:07:44.550
song and I think they were saying that Rebecca
Black was in the video. [sighs]

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:45.550
[laughter]

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:46.550
[end clip]

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:48.930
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: So, you've been using the web
to get your show promoted. How has that been?

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:54.280
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: It's, I think, been really
successful. We're using that. We're using

00:07:54.280 --> 00:08:00.300
Twitter. We're using all sorts of stuff. But
I've got a great couple people who are much

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:06.740
smarter than I am online and really think
about this a lot more than I have in the past.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:11.940
And I was reluctant to--. I feel like I work
enough as it is. I was resenting the idea

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:17.590
that I had to do this extra thing online,
but I've gotten over that and now it's become

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:23.810
incorporated in my daily routine. And I actually
like it. I like the intimacy of these kinds

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:24.810
of videos.

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:32.069
I like it's just me at my laptop. And my assistant
showed me how to save the things 'cause I

00:08:32.069 --> 00:08:36.060
screwed up the first couple ones. But I like
having that communication with viewers and

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:41.050
I think viewers like it as well. And in a
time when we're not yet on the air, we go

00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:45.760
on the air September 12th, and we just started
taping some shows, it's a way to start communicating

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:46.980
with viewers.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:51.790
And especially in daytime TV, I mean, for
those of you who have watched Oprah or one

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:57.720
of these daytime TV shows, it's about building
a sense of community, building connection

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.720
with viewers.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.720
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Right.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.180
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: And it's not just a program
that is on the air one hour a day. You want

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:06.680
it to be, if it's successful, and the shows
that have been the most successful and the

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.850
shows that I, as a viewer, feel the most connected
to and that's what you want.

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:13.510
You want people to feel connected to it. It's
not just connected to that one hour that you're

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:23.700
on the air. It's connected to it in a real-time,
24-hour way, online. There's a community of

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:24.700
people you talk to.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:25.920
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: You get feedback.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:31.360
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Yeah, you get feedback.
And the show and the website and the YouTube

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.260
channel, it's all a place where you feel you
belong and you wanna check in with.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:38.940
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: What is the purpose of a daytime
talk show? I mean, if you want a conversation

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:39.940
with--

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.760
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: In the TV business, if
we start asking ourselves that, none of us

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.760
will--

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:43.760
[laughter]

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:44.760
do anything.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.050
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: What is the purpose of your
show in your mind?

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:51.620
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: There's two purposes. I'll
say there's personal and then there's for

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:57.820
other people. For me, personally, I've been
reporting for 20 years and have from--.

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:01.040
I'm very passionate about news and about what
I do and I love to travel and go to the front

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:05.980
lines of stories. And I wanna continue doing
that. But I also, at the age of 44, wanna

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:11.269
do something which does allow for more human
connection with other people and which allows

00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:13.510
me to show more of my personality.

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:20.340
And news, there is a certain formality to
it and a certain one- or two-dimensional nature

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:25.089
of it. And it's nice to do something which
is more three-dimensional in which you show

00:10:25.089 --> 00:10:29.510
that you have a dry sense of humor or whatever
it is,

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:30.510
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Yeah.

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:34.690
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: to be able to show that.
And at other times when you're giggling like

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:40.160
a 13-year old girl. So, in a daytime format,
you really can. I have an audience of 300

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.010
people up at the Time Warner Center in the
Jazz at Lincoln Center Room. It's The Allen

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:46.410
Room. It's this incredible room.

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:50.180
And it's great to have that interaction with
the audience. And I really like it in real-time.

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:56.280
And you can have fun with people and it can
be serious. There's a great variety of things

00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:00.170
you can do in daytime. And for viewers, I
really do want--. I think there's a lot of

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:02.050
people who feel very disconnected.

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:05.580
And most viewers of daytime shows are women.
I think there's a lot of women out there,

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:10.600
particularly throughout the country, who have
faced huge challenges in their lives and huge

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:16.820
difficulties in trying to support their families
and also work and feel satisfied in their

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.130
lives and feel connected to their communities
and their families.

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:24.790
And I think you can really talk about real
things and things which really do resonate

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:25.790
with people's lives.

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:29.050
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Well, a lot of those fans and
viewers made questions on your YouTube channel.

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:30.070
We'll play a few of them now.

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:31.070
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: OK.

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:32.410
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: And then, we'll take some questions
from the folks here as well.

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:33.410
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Sounds good.

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:38.380
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: So, the top voted video question
came from this UNC student.

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:39.800
[plays video clip]

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:44.490
&gt;&gt;Student: Hey, Anderson. I'm Leslie and I
go to the University of North Carolina. I

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:47.050
was wondering what your favorite class in
college was, or if there was a class that

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:51.250
you took you found most useful for life in
general? Thanks.

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:52.250
[end clip]

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:55.459
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: God. I remember those bunk
beds. Jesus.

00:11:55.459 --> 00:11:56.459
[laughter]

00:11:56.459 --> 00:12:00.300
Do you remember those? Oy. Was there a class
in college that I found useful in life? No,

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:01.300
actually.

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.740
[laughter]

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:05.019
Did anybody find a class?

00:12:05.019 --> 00:12:06.760
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Ringing endorsement of going
to college.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.370
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Right. I don't wanna badmouth
Yale, but no, there was nothing.

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:10.370
[laughter]

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:12.920
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: You heard it here.

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:15.860
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Yeah, that's right. Exactly.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:16.860
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Don't go to Yale.

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:19.121
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: That's what I spent the
money on? I mean, I majored in Political Science,

00:12:19.121 --> 00:12:24.950
which at the time to me it was like majoring
in reading the newspaper every day. And I

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:29.230
don't quite understand what political science
enables me to do, or entitles me to do.

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:34.920
I mean, I was Liberal Arts major, which means
that I had no actual skill.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.800
[laughter]

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:43.450
And I work in TV 'cause I have no actual skill.
But I really don't--. I wasn't one of those

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:48.790
students in college who felt--. I didn't love
the college experience. Adults would say like,

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:52.771
"College was the best four years of my life."
And I think, "God, if that was the best four

00:12:52.771 --> 00:12:54.540
years of my life, just shoot me in the head
because--

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.459
[laughter]

00:12:56.459 --> 00:13:02.329
I mean, it was fine. It was great, I guess.
But the best four? I feel like the best is

00:13:02.329 --> 00:13:05.860
yet to come and each year it keeps getting
better and better and better. And at 44 and

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:10.550
I feel so much happier and more confident
and all that stuff than I did back then.

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:15.500
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Right after college, didn't
you essentially just start reporting from

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:16.500
war zones?

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.860
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: My brother had committed
suicide right before my senior year of college

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:24.470
and so my senior year was sort of a blur to
me. And when I graduated, I had not done any

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:28.830
job interviews. I really had no idea what
I wanted to do. I was really still trying

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:33.110
to adjust to the reality of the situation
and so, I took a year off.

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:37.760
And I lived on Long Island for a while. I
did carpentry work. And then I travelled around

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:43.029
in Southeast Asia on my own. But after that,
I decided--. I made a list of all the things

00:13:43.029 --> 00:13:49.650
I wanted in my life, like things that I wanted
to look back on and not achievement things,

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:53.480
but just, I wanted to feel fulfilled and I
wanted to see the world.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:14:00.269
And I didn't wanna be in a grey office in
a grey cubicle and a grey suit. So, of all

00:14:00.269 --> 00:14:03.670
the things and I watched a lot of TV growing
up, as I said, and I watched a lot of news.

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:08.690
I was probably the only eight-year old who
was really into Eric Sevareid. I mean, no

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:11.530
one in this room even knows who Eric Sevareid
is.

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:12.530
[laughter]

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:14.680
But had I said that at CNN, everybody would
be like, "Ah, yes."

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:17.580
[laughter]

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:18.589
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Was he a producer at CBS?

00:14:18.589 --> 00:14:22.450
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: No. He was a famous on
air person at CBS News. He's legendary. Anyway,

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:24.290
you kids today. You don't know.

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:25.290
[laughter]

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:27.490
You don't know what it was like in the--

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:28.490
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: 80s.

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:29.490
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: 1990s.

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:32.550
[laughter]

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:40.180
So, I thought, "Wow, being a news reporter
would be interesting." And I like TV and being

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:43.590
able to see history as it's happening would
be really cool. So, I tried to get an entry

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:45.301
level job in TV.

00:14:45.301 --> 00:14:50.279
I tried to get an entry level job at ABC News
and I could not get hired at ABC News. And

00:14:50.279 --> 00:14:53.700
there was a recession at the time. It was
like, '91, '92. So, I came up with this scheme

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:59.690
which was, "I'm gonna have a friend make a
press pass for me on a Macintosh computer."

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:04.589
And I did that and I borrowed a home video
camera and I decided I'm gonna go to wars

00:15:04.589 --> 00:15:10.230
because I won't have much competition 'cause
most people are too scared to go. And it'll

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:16.150
be an interesting life experience and also,
wars seemed dramatic and seemed interesting

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:18.100
in terms of things I could take pictures of.

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:21.350
So, that's what I did. I snuck into Burma
and I hooked up with some students fighting

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:24.920
the Burmese government, which is a struggle
which is still going on today, obviously.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:30.089
And I shot a story about them. And no one
ever checked my fake press pass. And then,

00:15:30.089 --> 00:15:31.380
I sold that story.

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:36.329
I put it together and I sold it to this thing
called Channel One, which was a show seen

00:15:36.329 --> 00:15:39.810
at high schools and middle schools throughout
the United States. Has anyone here had Channel

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:40.810
One in their--. One or two.

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:41.810
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Um-hmm. Yeah.

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:44.490
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: It was big in the mid-west
and south. And then they still didn't hire

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:48.630
me full-time, so then I said, "OK. I'm gonna
go to Africa. I'm gonna go to ten different

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:53.079
countries. I guarantee you ten stories. It's
gonna cost you two thousand dollars a story

00:15:53.079 --> 00:15:54.190
and here are the ten stories."

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:57.690
And I made up ten stories. I'd left high school
semester early and driven in a truck across

00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:02.600
the sub-Sahara in Africa, so I was familiar
with Africa, or sub-Saharan Africa. And the

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.920
story I did was I went into Somalia in the
early days of the famine there, which was,

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.410
there was a famine back in '92.

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:11.579
And there's a famine now. But there was a
famine back in '92. I went there and that

00:16:11.579 --> 00:16:17.650
was really the first real major breaking story
that I shot stories about. And it had a big

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:20.580
impact on the Channel One audience. I got
hired and that's how I became a reporter.

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:21.940
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: So, Channel One was your start--

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:25.870
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Yeah, it was absolutely
my start. And for the next two years, they

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:31.160
made me their, like I was their only travelling
foreign correspondent, war correspondent.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.160
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Yeah.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.740
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: I just went from one war
to another. I was in Bosnia during the war

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:41.010
there. I was in Rwanda during the genocide
with RPF who were fighting to stop the genocide.

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:42.010
So, yeah.

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:45.480
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Well, the news stories today
are obviously different than back then. Although,

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:48.580
certainly there are similarities. One of the
top voted questions, as I can recall--. Let

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:51.779
me see if I can dial it up. Yeah. Is about
today's news.

00:16:51.779 --> 00:16:52.779
[plays video clip]

00:16:52.779 --> 00:16:55.320
&gt;&gt;Girl: Hey, Anderson. I just read the Jared
Diamond book, "Collapse," which is about the

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:58.920
rise and fall of civilizations over time.
And as a reporter, my question to you is what

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:02.110
factors have you seen that's contributed to
the decline, or even fall, of modern-day nations,

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:03.620
which is, I think, more relevant than ever
with all the unrest going on in Africa and

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:04.620
the Middle East?

00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:10.649
By the way, I really love your shows. I went
to last week's taping of Anderson and it was

00:17:10.649 --> 00:17:15.279
really great. Keep up the good work.

00:17:15.279 --> 00:17:17.720
[end clip]

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:25.970
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Oh, cool. All right. Cool.
That's nice. Wow, what factors have contributed

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:27.659
to the decline of civilizations?

00:17:27.659 --> 00:17:28.659
[laughter]

00:17:28.659 --> 00:17:29.659
Sure.

00:17:29.659 --> 00:17:31.789
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: The question that you should
be asking in your talk show every day.

00:17:31.789 --> 00:17:36.309
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Yes, exactly. I have the
Beverly Hills Housewives on to talk about

00:17:36.309 --> 00:17:37.960
that very subject as a matter of fact.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:38.960
[laughter]

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.139
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: We'll all tune in for that
one.

00:17:40.139 --> 00:17:47.159
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Yes. Yes. Camille Grammer
has some fascinating ideas on this subject.

00:17:47.159 --> 00:17:48.159
[laughter]

00:17:48.159 --> 00:17:50.109
And I love Camille Grammer because she speaks
with her shoulders. I don't know if you've

00:17:50.109 --> 00:17:53.070
noticed this. She's just like--. She says
these things like, "You're just jealous."

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:54.070
[laughter]

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:55.320
I love that. Love her.

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.320
[laughter]

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:59.679
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Why don't you answer this question
using that style?

00:17:59.679 --> 00:18:03.430
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Right. Exactly. Look.

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:06.519
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: The Middle East is the hot
spot right now. You've been covering this

00:18:06.519 --> 00:18:07.519
every day, obviously.

00:18:07.519 --> 00:18:11.640
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Yeah. I mean, obviously
you have these entrenched rulers in the Middle

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:15.830
East who have destroyed their countries. I
mean, you look at Libya right now.

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:21.330
There's only six million people in Libya.
Their school system is a nightmare. Their

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:26.039
hospital system, their health care system
is pathetic. The amount of money that Muammar

00:18:26.039 --> 00:18:31.239
Gaddafi has made from oil in the 42 years
of his reign is extraordinary. And the fact

00:18:31.239 --> 00:18:38.059
that he hasn't been able to adequately care
for six million people is unbelievable to

00:18:38.059 --> 00:18:39.059
me.

00:18:39.059 --> 00:18:42.350
And, I mean, it's not unbelievable because
he is a complete thug and the people around

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:47.730
him are thugs and liars and crooks, as are
most of these regimes. I mean, you look at

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:53.269
people around Hosni Mubarak. And up until
the very end they were lying. They were just

00:18:53.269 --> 00:18:55.149
telling lies.

00:18:55.149 --> 00:19:00.799
And I think it's extraordinary what we're
witnessing. I mean, every night now, pretty

00:19:00.799 --> 00:19:07.909
much every night, I focus on what's happening
in Syria. And it's YouTube and its people

00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:12.679
who are risking their lives to upload videos
that is the reason I'm able to continue to

00:19:12.679 --> 00:19:13.749
do this story every night.

00:19:13.749 --> 00:19:19.630
Because without those pictures, without those
images, we wouldn't be able to tell the story.

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:23.210
I mean, you can talk about the story, but
it will have no reality for people unless

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:28.559
you see those images. So, to me, we're living
in this extraordinary time of change.

00:19:28.559 --> 00:19:32.909
And I mean, just what we're witnessing right
now in Libya, in Syria, I mean, I never thought

00:19:32.909 --> 00:19:38.880
really that I would see this and that it would
happen so quickly. But I think a lot of it

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.710
has to do just with the arrogance of power.

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:41.710
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Yeah.

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:44.070
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: And I was just reading
this wonderful book by a Polish journalist

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:46.960
about Emperor Haile Selassie. It's called
"The Emperor." It's a great oral history.

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:47.960
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Mm-hmm.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:52.840
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: And just the way he, Haile
Selassie, who ruled Ethiopia many years ago,

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:57.519
he was able to manipulate and stay in power
by playing, very much like Gaddafi was able

00:19:57.519 --> 00:20:01.460
to play tribes and others against each other.
So, I didn't really answer her question. But

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:04.159
I think it's too long and involved a question,
but--.

00:20:04.159 --> 00:20:07.869
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Well, it's interesting that
today's version of you in the early 90s might

00:20:07.869 --> 00:20:12.190
not necessarily have to drop into a war zone
because there are--. There's footage streaming

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:13.419
out of there and onto the web all day long.

00:20:13.419 --> 00:20:17.389
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Yeah. Well, I still think
it's important to be able to go to a place

00:20:17.389 --> 00:20:21.720
and see it for yourself, because you don't
know what these images really are. I mean,

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:25.929
in many cases we can't independently confirm
what some of these images show. Are some of

00:20:25.929 --> 00:20:28.599
these people who are in plain clothes killing
people?

00:20:28.599 --> 00:20:29.599
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Yeah. It's the [inaudible].

00:20:29.599 --> 00:20:32.869
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Or, do we know for a fact
that they are Syrian government thugs or are

00:20:32.869 --> 00:20:39.190
they protesters who are attacking plain clothes
Syrian officers? We don't know in some cases.

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:44.279
But so, I do think it's important to go there.
And it really, going to the frontlines of

00:20:44.279 --> 00:20:48.049
combat and conflict, it really does make you
see it in different--.

00:20:48.049 --> 00:20:51.519
When I graduated college, I thought, with
my little Political Science degree, I thought

00:20:51.519 --> 00:20:57.899
I knew what was going on. I had firmly held
opinions about the way the world worked. And

00:20:57.899 --> 00:21:02.099
I started travelling and realizing I didn't
know anything. And the more you travel, I

00:21:02.099 --> 00:21:06.029
think, it's a cliché, but the more you realize
the less you know.

00:21:06.029 --> 00:21:09.029
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Right. The number one voted
question, and there was actually a lot of

00:21:09.029 --> 00:21:13.110
questions of this flavor, was, "With all the
devastation in the world and all the stories

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:17.049
that you've covered, which one has been the
most difficult to cover and most difficult

00:21:17.049 --> 00:21:19.789
to get out of your head?" This question actually
came from Germany.

00:21:19.789 --> 00:21:24.470
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: The most difficult to get
out of my head. I don't believe in getting

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:29.950
stories out of my head. I'm not, I don't believe
in coming back and trying to be able to sleep

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:35.220
well at night. I honestly think you should
carry these--to me they're not stories.

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:41.049
I mean, these are--. I'm interacting with
people who often end up dead or whose lives

00:21:41.049 --> 00:21:47.419
have been unbelievably tormented. And so for
me, it's a huge privilege to be invited into

00:21:47.419 --> 00:21:51.240
their home or into their hut or into their
lives and to tell their story. So--.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:54.559
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Is there one story in particular
that sticks out?

00:21:54.559 --> 00:22:00.029
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: I spent a lot of time in
the Congo. In the Eastern Congo there's a

00:22:00.029 --> 00:22:05.370
horrific war. It's actually the deadliest
conflict since World War II. Millions of people

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:09.509
have been killed over the last ten years,
dying directly from combat, but also from

00:22:09.509 --> 00:22:12.450
the after-effects of it--malnutrition and
hunger.

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:16.299
And it's really a war against women that tens
of thousands of women have been raped and

00:22:16.299 --> 00:22:21.450
the majority of them have been brutally gang
raped. And you meet women in hospitals, who

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:26.200
after being gang raped by six soldiers have
had AK-47s inserted inside them, the guys

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:27.200
pull the trigger.

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:33.549
And they're alive, but their bodies are destroyed,
obviously. I met a woman named Angela who,

00:22:33.549 --> 00:22:38.429
she had been gang raped by six soldiers, forcibly
raped in front of her family, in front of

00:22:38.429 --> 00:22:42.869
her village. And they do this on purpose to
destroy the entire community by destroying

00:22:42.869 --> 00:22:44.269
the community's women.

00:22:44.269 --> 00:22:48.460
And they tried to force her brother to rape
her and he refused. And so they slit his throat

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:51.591
in front of her. She had three children. They
burned one of the children in front of her

00:22:51.591 --> 00:22:56.309
while they were raping her. After they left,
her husband then kicked her out of the village

00:22:56.309 --> 00:23:01.099
because he was afraid she was HIV-positive
and he was ashamed of her.

00:23:01.099 --> 00:23:05.830
And yet, this was a woman who every day was
still able to wake up and hold her head high

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:13.700
and try to find a job and try to feed her
kids. And to me, she is--

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:14.700
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: It's courage.

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:18.220
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Yeah. I mean, it's beyond
courage. It's hard to even fathom being able

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:22.770
to do all that. So, that's somebody who stays
with me when I close my eyes at night. And

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:26.669
I don't think I should get her out of my head.
I think those are people who should stay with

00:23:26.669 --> 00:23:27.669
you.

00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:28.669
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Yeah, yeah.

00:23:28.669 --> 00:23:31.059
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: But in terms of hardest,
I mean, there are things that hard logistically,

00:23:31.059 --> 00:23:32.059
like--

00:23:32.059 --> 00:23:36.129
Egypt after and during the fall of Mubarak,
where--

00:23:36.129 --> 00:23:37.200
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Right. Right.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.690
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: we're getting attacked,
reporters getting attacked.

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:41.239
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: You got punched in the streets
of Tahrir Square, is that right?

00:23:41.239 --> 00:23:44.919
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Yeah. Which I've never
been punched in the head before and I was

00:23:44.919 --> 00:23:47.970
always like, "I wonder what it would be like
to be punched in the head?" And now I know.

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:48.970
[laughter]

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:49.970
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Life experience.

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:52.400
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: That's right. But I was
very lucky. There was--

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.400
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Yeah.

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:58.269
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: my person behind me shortly
afterwards, was stabbed in the back with a

00:23:58.269 --> 00:24:04.499
screwdriver. Lara Logan was obviously attacked.
The Fox News crew was brutally beaten. But

00:24:04.499 --> 00:24:08.831
there are things which make it logistically
very difficult for us to tell the story.

00:24:08.831 --> 00:24:09.831
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Right. Right.

00:24:09.831 --> 00:24:11.110
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: When you're on the run,
you're hiding in hotel rooms or apartments

00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:17.249
and trying to broadcast. And there are things
which emotionally are very difficult. And

00:24:17.249 --> 00:24:21.769
Haiti, after the earthquake, was probably,
and Hurricane Katrina. Those were certainly

00:24:21.769 --> 00:24:24.179
two situations that I'll never forget.

00:24:24.179 --> 00:24:30.159
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Yeah. Well, one of the other
top voted questions had to do with, let me

00:24:30.159 --> 00:24:36.679
see if I can find it here, [pause] umm, yeah.
You meet a lot of interesting people, many

00:24:36.679 --> 00:24:40.360
of them in the places you just talked about.
This woman wants to know about who you'd most

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:41.489
like to meet with.

00:24:41.489 --> 00:24:42.659
[plays video clip]

00:24:42.659 --> 00:24:48.869
&gt;&gt;Woman: Hey, Anderson. My question for you
is, if you could have five people to dinner

00:24:48.869 --> 00:24:51.399
with you, living, deceased, or fictional,
who would they be and why? Can't wait for

00:24:51.399 --> 00:24:54.989
your new show. I love AC 360. Thanks a lot.

00:24:54.989 --> 00:24:55.989
[end clip]

00:24:55.989 --> 00:24:58.779
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: You have a lot of fans out
there.

00:24:58.779 --> 00:24:59.779
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Wow. OK.

00:24:59.779 --> 00:25:00.779
[clip starts playing again]

00:25:00.779 --> 00:25:01.779
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Oops. Sorry.

00:25:01.779 --> 00:25:03.200
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Even better the second
time.

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.200
[laughter]

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:07.250
If I had a dinner party with five--. First
of all, I would never have a dinner party

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:10.440
because I'm a social recluse. And the idea
of having a dinner party is painful to me.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.440
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Really?

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.440
[laughter]

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.440
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Yes.

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:14.440
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: TV guy is actually a social
recluse?

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:16.650
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Yeah. I mean, yeah. I mean,
I think it's 'cause I'm around people all

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:20.291
day when I work and stuff and I'm really engaged
with people and I really like talking to people

00:25:20.291 --> 00:25:25.120
and stuff. But naturally, I tend to like,
at the party, not that I would be at a party,

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:26.321
but if I was at a party--

00:25:26.321 --> 00:25:27.321
[laughter]

00:25:27.321 --> 00:25:31.211
theoretically, I would be the guy in the kitchen
pretending I was looking for ice.

00:25:31.211 --> 00:25:32.211
[laughter]

00:25:32.211 --> 00:25:34.859
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: You sound like a lot of Googlers
actually.

00:25:34.859 --> 00:25:37.509
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Yeah, that's right.

00:25:37.509 --> 00:25:38.509
[laughter]

00:25:38.509 --> 00:25:39.509
[clapping]

00:25:39.509 --> 00:25:40.889
That's why I feel so comfortable here.

00:25:40.889 --> 00:25:42.609
[laughter]

00:25:42.609 --> 00:25:47.489
Yeah, that's funny. But literally, I can look
for ice for a good half hour.

00:25:47.489 --> 00:25:48.489
[laughter]

00:25:48.489 --> 00:25:50.429
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Without finding it.

00:25:50.429 --> 00:25:54.370
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Without finding it. That's
why BlackBerrys are so great 'cause you're

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:57.450
like, "Oh, look. There's something very important
I'm doing."

00:25:57.450 --> 00:25:58.659
[laughter]

00:25:58.659 --> 00:26:04.169
But I guess, I don't really know how to answer
this question. I mean, honestly, if I'm answering

00:26:04.169 --> 00:26:09.139
it honestly, I would--. My dad died when I
was ten and I never knew him. And my grandparents.

00:26:09.139 --> 00:26:15.239
So, if I had to have five people over, I would
like to have my dad and the sets of grandparents

00:26:15.239 --> 00:26:22.249
to just see what they were like. And I think
anyone who loses a parent at an early age,

00:26:22.249 --> 00:26:26.909
you it really, it leaves a mark and really
changes who you are. And I think I was a much

00:26:26.909 --> 00:26:29.499
more interesting person before I was ten.

00:26:29.499 --> 00:26:34.499
So, I think I became much more serious and
much more independent and focused on work

00:26:34.499 --> 00:26:38.940
and getting things done after my dad passed
away. So, it would be interesting to see what

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:40.789
he was like as an adult.

00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:44.269
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: The third voted text question
we got online--

00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:47.119
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: I know I was probably supposed
to answer like, the Pope or something for

00:26:47.119 --> 00:26:48.440
those questions.

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:49.580
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: The honorable answer.

00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:52.309
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: I don't know if you've
ever noticed when reporters get asked like,

00:26:52.309 --> 00:26:54.779
"Who would you like to interview?" It's like,
"The Pope." Or,--.

00:26:54.779 --> 00:26:55.779
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Jesus Christ.

00:26:55.779 --> 00:26:56.779
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Right. Yes.

00:26:56.779 --> 00:26:57.779
[laughter]

00:26:57.779 --> 00:26:58.779
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: A good answer as well.

00:26:58.779 --> 00:27:00.080
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Yeah, all right.

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:01.080
[laughter]

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:02.080
I'll work on my answer.

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:06.299
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: It was a good answer, a great
answer. You're usually the one asking the

00:27:06.299 --> 00:27:07.299
questions, actually.

00:27:07.299 --> 00:27:10.619
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: That's true. I also, I
grew up in a really interesting family and

00:27:10.619 --> 00:27:15.659
so we had a lot of well-known people over
at my house at dinner as a kid. So, I feel

00:27:15.659 --> 00:27:18.559
like I've been to dinner parties with interesting
people and they're never as interesting as

00:27:18.559 --> 00:27:19.559
you think they're gonna be.

00:27:19.559 --> 00:27:20.559
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Oh, really.

00:27:20.559 --> 00:27:21.919
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Yeah. I mean, it's always
somewhat disappointing.

00:27:21.919 --> 00:27:22.919
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: That's good to know.

00:27:22.919 --> 00:27:23.919
[laughter]

00:27:23.919 --> 00:27:24.919
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Yeah, it's good to know.

00:27:24.919 --> 00:27:27.190
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: We'll make sure this woman
in I think it was Tennessee--

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:29.830
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Right. Don't dream about
meeting famous people. They're very boring.

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:31.820
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: It's not all it's cracked up
to be.

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:32.820
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Exactly.

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:37.289
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: You mentioned that you're not
super social. One of the, the third asked

00:27:37.289 --> 00:27:41.210
question asks, "What do you do when you're
not on air?" So, what do you do for fun? And

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:44.700
I think the way they phrased it is, "What
gives you that 'ahh' moment?"

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:45.700
[laughter]

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:46.700
Ahh.

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:48.660
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Wow. You committed to that.
I like that.

00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:49.700
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: I'm half-committed.

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:50.700
[laughter]

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:53.200
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Yeah, you half-committed,
but we can work on that. The--

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.299
[laughter]

00:27:54.299 --> 00:28:02.169
What do I do? I really--. So, OK. So, I work
now. I basically do these two different jobs

00:28:02.169 --> 00:28:06.489
and I also work for 60 Minutes on the side.
Most of my 60 Minutes work, I can only do

00:28:06.489 --> 00:28:10.999
on weekends or on holidays, when I take vacation
from my other jobs 'cause I can't have my

00:28:10.999 --> 00:28:12.769
60 Minutes work interfere with the other jobs.

00:28:12.769 --> 00:28:17.330
So, I don't have a lot of free time because
honestly, I would much--. I really like what

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:23.120
I do and I would much rather go someplace
to do a story or to meet some people than

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:28.230
I would to go to a place and sit on a beach
or just take a vacation. To me--

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:30.212
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: So, work is play in some ways
for you.

00:28:30.212 --> 00:28:33.759
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: In some ways, yeah. I mean,
for instance, I just went down to Cuba for

00:28:33.759 --> 00:28:39.479
60 Minutes for a story that involved a lot
of diving. And it was, I would much rather

00:28:39.479 --> 00:28:43.940
take a week of vacation from CNN in order
to do it. And previously, I had taken a week

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:49.309
of vacation from CNN to go to South Africa
with 60 Minutes and do a story on Great White

00:28:49.309 --> 00:28:50.309
sharks.

00:28:50.309 --> 00:28:54.269
And there's this guy who free dives and scuba
dives with Great White sharks without a cage.

00:28:54.269 --> 00:28:59.090
So, he's like the only guy who does this.
So I was doing a profile of him. So, I went

00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:04.419
scuba diving with him with the Great Whites
without a cage, which is kind of insane.

00:29:04.419 --> 00:29:05.419
[laughter]

00:29:05.419 --> 00:29:06.549
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: It's not just kind of insane.

00:29:06.549 --> 00:29:12.210
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Right. It's actually amazing
and incredibly exhilarating. It's very surreal

00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:19.659
when they'd been chumming the water with blood
for a good hour and then you see 6, 15- to

00:29:19.659 --> 00:29:22.719
20-foot Great White sharks circling around
the boat. And you're like, "All right, time

00:29:22.719 --> 00:29:23.719
to get in."

00:29:23.719 --> 00:29:24.719
[laughter]

00:29:24.719 --> 00:29:31.820
And I will say dipping your first finned toe
into the water is a little weird. So, I would

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:35.370
much rather go and do something like that
than just take a boring vacation. I'm really

00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:36.370
bad on vacations.

00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:39.539
I usually end up cancelling them or coming
back after three days 'cause I'm bored.

00:29:39.539 --> 00:29:40.539
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Really?

00:29:40.539 --> 00:29:43.259
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Yeah. I went to Buenos
Aires on vacation and I literally after three

00:29:43.259 --> 00:29:47.639
days came back 'cause I didn't really know
anyone. And I was just like, I didn't know

00:29:47.639 --> 00:29:48.859
what to do. So I came back.

00:29:48.859 --> 00:29:49.859
[laughter]

00:29:49.859 --> 00:29:53.379
But on the weekend I'm not working, I honestly,
the biggest thing I do is sleep.

00:29:53.379 --> 00:29:54.379
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Yeah.

00:29:54.379 --> 00:29:56.249
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: I really, to me, sleep
is like the most precious commodity.

00:29:56.249 --> 00:29:57.950
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: You live in New York City,
right?

00:29:57.950 --> 00:29:58.950
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: I do.

00:29:58.950 --> 00:29:59.950
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: How many--

00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:01.469
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Very close to here. I just
bought a firehouse very close to here.

00:30:01.469 --> 00:30:02.469
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: A firehouse?

00:30:02.469 --> 00:30:04.379
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: I did, yes. An old--

00:30:04.379 --> 00:30:11.110
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: With firemen in it, or what?

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:12.110
[laughter]

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:13.110
I'm guessing they left, right?

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:15.820
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Yes. They left. We'll see
what happens, but--

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:16.820
[laughter]

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:20.169
It's a 1906 firehouse that was decommissioned
back in 2007 and it was empty.

00:30:20.169 --> 00:30:21.169
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Really?

00:30:21.169 --> 00:30:23.099
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Yeah. And so, I'm moving
in soon.

00:30:23.099 --> 00:30:24.099
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: That's cool.

00:30:24.099 --> 00:30:25.099
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Yeah. It is cool.

00:30:25.099 --> 00:30:27.419
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: How many days a year do you
spend in New York City? I'm assuming you travel

00:30:27.419 --> 00:30:28.419
all the time. Like, 50/50?

00:30:28.419 --> 00:30:34.570
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: I really don't travel as
much, I think, as much as I used to. I'm usually

00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:40.609
on the road maybe one week a month at the
most.

00:30:40.609 --> 00:30:41.609
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Oh, OK.

00:30:41.609 --> 00:30:43.280
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: There are times when the
earthquake in Haiti happened; I was there

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:46.909
for a month. And when Katrina happened, I
was there for a month. I was in Israel when

00:30:46.909 --> 00:30:48.080
the fighting against Hezbollah happened.

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:51.049
But for the most part, my trips are in the
ten-day range.

00:30:51.049 --> 00:30:54.900
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: OK. I wanna invite the audience
to start thinking of questions and make it

00:30:54.900 --> 00:31:01.529
to the mic when you can. But before that,
I wanna go through a rapid round of text questions.

00:31:01.529 --> 00:31:02.529
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Oh, OK.

00:31:02.529 --> 00:31:05.919
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: The first one came from username
Ruegel853710.

00:31:05.919 --> 00:31:10.220
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Oh, man. I love her. She's
so great.

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:12.499
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Yeah, she's the greatest, isn't
she?

00:31:12.499 --> 00:31:13.499
[laughter]

00:31:13.499 --> 00:31:14.499
Her question is, do you ever Google yourself?

00:31:14.499 --> 00:31:19.019
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Do I ever Google myself?
That's an interesting question. Yes, of course.

00:31:19.019 --> 00:31:22.929
Nobody who says they don't Google themselves,
everybody Googles themselves from time to

00:31:22.929 --> 00:31:27.640
time. But I will say I have drastically cut
it down over the last couple years--

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:28.640
[laughter]

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:35.529
and rarely ever now do it. And if I do it,
I'm like, "Don't do it." I have to talk myself

00:31:35.529 --> 00:31:39.259
down sometimes. I'm like, "Don't do it." I
have like A-N-D-E in there and I'm like, "Don't

00:31:39.259 --> 00:31:42.849
do it." And I'm like, R-S-O-N. And then I'm
like, "No, I'm not gonna do it."

00:31:42.849 --> 00:31:43.849
[laughter]

00:31:43.849 --> 00:31:49.959
My mom actually, when I was early on, she
was pretty well-known when I was a kid and

00:31:49.959 --> 00:31:54.669
she would always say, "Never read anything
about yourself." And I think it's actually

00:31:54.669 --> 00:31:55.669
really good advice.

00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:59.950
It's very difficult advice to do, but if you're
able to do it its good because ultimately,

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:07.029
I find that, especially as a reporter, it
does me no good to think about myself as somebody

00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:13.129
who's well-known. Like, I live--. I have this
illusion that I'm not well-known and that

00:32:13.129 --> 00:32:18.169
I work on a TV show and I don't really think
about anybody actually seeing it.

00:32:18.169 --> 00:32:21.889
And I'm always eternally surprised every day
on the street when people are saying "hello"

00:32:21.889 --> 00:32:27.330
to me. And I think in my mind, I just think
like, "OK. People are just saying hi." It

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:28.330
doesn't really--

00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:29.330
[laughter]

00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:30.330
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Really?

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:31.330
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Yeah. I don't think--

00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:32.330
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: You don't wear like a low baseball
cap and--

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:37.089
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Well, I do wear a baseball
cap. But I just don't think it's healthy to

00:32:37.089 --> 00:32:41.859
think about yourself as a public person because
it just, it doesn't contribute to anything

00:32:41.859 --> 00:32:43.450
about what I'm interested in my work.

00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:46.120
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Yeah. Are you sensitive to
stuff you find online about yourself, if you

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:47.299
do actually complete it and push enter?

00:32:47.299 --> 00:32:51.529
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Not really. Look, I get--.
I do know rationally that I'm on television.

00:32:51.529 --> 00:32:54.230
So, I get that there's gonna be a certain
level of interest.

00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:55.480
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Yeah.

00:32:55.480 --> 00:33:00.690
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: And so be it. And I appreciate
that people are interested. I'm generally

00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:06.970
a lot more boring than people might like to
imagine. But it doesn't really bother me.

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:07.970
I mean,--

00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:08.970
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Well, that's the web.

00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:13.259
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: I've been doing this now
for 20 years. I know how the game is played.

00:33:13.259 --> 00:33:14.649
I just, it doesn't bother me.

00:33:14.649 --> 00:33:15.649
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Yeah.

00:33:15.649 --> 00:33:16.860
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: There's very little that
bothers me.

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:18.739
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Well then, you'd be good in
daytime TV, I would think.

00:33:18.739 --> 00:33:19.959
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: That's right. Exactly.

00:33:19.959 --> 00:33:24.139
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: I mean, go for it. Another
user in San Jose asks, "What's the weirdest,

00:33:24.139 --> 00:33:28.350
most memorable fan encounter you've had?"
So when people do recognize you, what's the

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:29.669
weird stuff that happens?

00:33:29.669 --> 00:33:35.920
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Well there's like the restraining
order encounters that I--

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:36.920
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Oh, really?

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:39.359
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Yeah. There's a lot of
that.

00:33:39.359 --> 00:33:40.359
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: It happens a lot.

00:33:40.359 --> 00:33:41.359
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Yeah, a fair amount.

00:33:41.359 --> 00:33:42.359
[laughter]

00:33:42.359 --> 00:33:43.359
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Like, how many restraining
orders are there out right now?

00:33:43.359 --> 00:33:46.529
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: I'm not sure how many are
current 'cause they elapse after a year.

00:33:46.529 --> 00:33:47.609
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Oh, OK.

00:33:47.609 --> 00:33:48.609
[laughter]

00:33:48.609 --> 00:33:54.580
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: And it depends on what
state you're talking about. But it's interesting.

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:59.570
It is interesting to me how people develop
a real relationship with you when you're on

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:00.570
television.

00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:05.549
And I really like that and 99.9% of that relationship
is wonderful and people are incredibly nice.

00:34:05.549 --> 00:34:09.940
Walking around New York City for me is like,
literally living in a small town. I literally

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:13.609
have conversations all day long with--. I
ride the subway every day.

00:34:13.609 --> 00:34:17.960
Or, even if I'm on my bicycle when I'm stopped
at a light, people are talking, saying "hello"

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:26.369
to me and it's always very nice. And I love
it. And I encourage it. There are really people

00:34:26.369 --> 00:34:33.270
who become very, very, very interested and
end up showing up at my home with all their

00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:34.480
possessions to move in with me.

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:35.849
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Oh, really? That happened?

00:34:35.849 --> 00:34:36.849
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Oh, yeah.

00:34:36.849 --> 00:34:39.470
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: What do you say to them?

00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:42.731
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Well, the lady in particular
who came to live with me--

00:34:42.731 --> 00:34:44.440
[laughter]

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:52.720
who, I think was probably about 55 or so.
She had been emailing me for a long time and

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:59.140
then she, which I had stopped reading the
emails and they were automatically forwarded

00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:02.430
to the CNN security department, as you might
imagine.

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:07.470
But I thought someone was reading them, but
apparently no one was because then she showed

00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:11.330
up at my apartment and then I went back and
I was like, "Well, maybe I should look at

00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:13.930
some of the old emails." And she had announced
her intentions quite clearly.

00:35:13.930 --> 00:35:17.680
In fact, she had said like, "I'm arriving
on the 8:30 flight, but don't worry about

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:22.300
picking me up at the airport." Which I thought
was very, very thoughtful of her.

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:23.300
[laughter]

00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:24.300
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: How kind.

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:25.300
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Yes.

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:26.300
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Very thoughtful.

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:28.200
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: So that was probably one
of the more interesting ones. But there's

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:29.200
been--

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.200
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: So you walk on your front door
and literally--

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:31.891
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Thankfully, I was not home
at the time.

00:35:31.891 --> 00:35:32.891
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Oh, OK.

00:35:32.891 --> 00:35:34.460
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: But then she came to work,
so she made it easier.

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:35.859
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: She found you.

00:35:35.859 --> 00:35:37.829
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Yeah, she found me. Yes.

00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:41.650
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: A question all the way from
Quitar, and let's please make it to the mic

00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:46.700
if you have a question. We'd love to hear
your questions soon. The question is, "Best

00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:48.050
person you've interviewed and why?"

00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:49.090
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Hmm.

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:50.820
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Any particular interview?

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:56.000
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: I would, I mean, I mentioned
that woman, Angela. I mean, she was somebody

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.989
who stays with me. And so, it's generally
people like that who most people have never

00:35:58.989 --> 00:36:03.300
heard of or wouldn't really know about. Celebrities,
this year I think I interviewed Lady Gaga

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:07.349
and Eminem for 60 Minutes and I found both
of them really interesting and enjoyed getting

00:36:07.349 --> 00:36:08.349
to know them.

00:36:08.349 --> 00:36:10.069
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: What's Lady Gaga like in person?

00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:15.589
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Exactly what you would
imagine. She's really cool. She's 25 years

00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:21.650
old, which is incredible that she's achieved
so much. And she is completely in charge of--.

00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:29.210
She is driving that ship. I mean, she is,
I think, incredibly talented. I think she's

00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:32.420
got an amazing voice and I think she's--.
I've enjoyed her.

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:34.099
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Do you listen to her?

00:36:34.099 --> 00:36:37.519
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Yeah. I totally listen
to her. I like her a lot. And it was just

00:36:37.519 --> 00:36:42.100
cool that she's somebody you'd want to hang
out with. She was fun to hang out with.

00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:43.100
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Cool. Well, let's take some
questions from the audience.

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:44.100
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Sure.

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:45.100
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Over here.

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:46.100
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: Hi.

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:47.100
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Hey.

00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:48.100
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: So, I love your
show.

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:49.100
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Oh, thank you.

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:50.100
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: And I wanna say
first, when you do your show I think it's

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:54.420
great when other entities move on to other
subjects, that you continue to stay in Haiti

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:56.970
or Japan or what have you and that's really
great.

00:36:56.970 --> 00:37:01.630
I think one of the things that concerns me
most is how our government doesn't seem to

00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:04.900
be in sync with the population, I think with
the debt ceiling and all that kind of stuff.

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:08.290
Regardless of what side you're on, we're all
going, "What's up with Washington?"

00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:09.290
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Right.

00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:13.599
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: And so my first
thought was why isn't the media really separating

00:37:13.599 --> 00:37:17.260
itself from the dog and pony show and really
forcing Washington, but then hearing you talk

00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:22.849
about Syria and Egypt, it became clear to
me, we're not in as bad a shape obviously.

00:37:22.849 --> 00:37:26.690
But the government here is not getting what
the people are wanting. So, what can we do

00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:32.309
with social technologies that Americans aren't
using and what can the media do to help us?

00:37:32.309 --> 00:37:35.599
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Wow. That's interesting.
I mean, I think you're clearly, you're absolutely

00:37:35.599 --> 00:37:40.720
right. If you look at just polling information,
it's not just whether it's Republicans or

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:46.420
Democrats. People are just sick of the whole
group. And they lump the group together.

00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:52.279
And whether it's the President or Congress,
it's all of a piece. In terms of what social

00:37:52.279 --> 00:37:55.470
media, I don't know. I think you guys probably
know that better than what I do. I'm still

00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:57.660
figuring out my little YouTube channel.

00:37:57.660 --> 00:38:02.313
[laughter]
But I do think social media--. I mean, I just

00:38:02.313 --> 00:38:09.779
think the ability to have conversations and
link people from different walks of life together

00:38:09.779 --> 00:38:14.950
in an online experience and give you direct
contact to people in Washington, I think is

00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:15.950
a unique thing.

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:21.420
It used to be you'd have to write-in to your
Congressman or call them up. And you have

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:25.950
the ability now to have much more direct links
and communication with their offices with

00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:31.930
them if they are online. And I think that
does really have an impact. I mean, I read

00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:36.950
my viewers tweets and email comments and comments
on the YouTube channel.

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:40.660
I read them every single day, several times
a day. It's often the first thing I read waking

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:44.930
up in the morning after I read the news headlines
and the last thing I read going to bed to

00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:50.390
respond to. And it really does have an impact.
I mean, I don't think you can underestimate

00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:52.720
the impact hearing directly from people has.

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:54.970
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Great. Let's go over here.

00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:58.819
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: So, another question
about politics. Something that struck me as

00:38:58.819 --> 00:39:03.300
really bizarre in the cable news world a couple
weeks ago was what the Ames Poll reported.

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:10.200
Like I mean, they would say, "First place
goes to so and so. Third place goes to so

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:12.640
and so. Fourth place goes to so and so." And
leaving out Ron Paul.

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:13.640
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Ron Paul.

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:18.559
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: And it's not even
like, not reporting on him, it's almost to

00:39:18.559 --> 00:39:20.920
the point of pretending he doesn't exist and
it's just weird. Do you have any insight on

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:21.920
that?

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:25.539
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: I mean, I've had Ron Paul
on a lot and he’s' a great guest. And I've

00:39:25.539 --> 00:39:31.920
had him on my show a number of times. So,
I've certainly heard that criticism and not

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:38.089
only Ron, but also a Senator Rand Paul on
as well. And I look to book him quite often

00:39:38.089 --> 00:39:40.700
'cause I think he's got a really interesting
take on things.

00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:43.150
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: I don't mean to
criticize you personally.

00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:44.150
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: I know, I know.

00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:45.150
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: I'm just wondering
what--.

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:48.069
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: I think certainly a lot
of; I don't want to speak for other networks.

00:39:48.069 --> 00:39:51.650
I don't know how much of a conscious decision
that was. I really don't know. I mean, I didn't

00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:57.910
see the other networks coverage of it and
stuff. But I know Ron Paul's been on CNN a

00:39:57.910 --> 00:40:00.119
fair amount as far as I can tell.

00:40:00.119 --> 00:40:04.349
But, and I don't want to sound like I'm copping
out on the answer, but I really don't watch

00:40:04.349 --> 00:40:11.881
a lot of other folks coverage. I'm focused
on my little hour. It doesn't make any sense

00:40:11.881 --> 00:40:16.730
why they would not and Ron Paul came in second
on that and has been not only the driving

00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:20.960
force in the last election, but also a driving
force in the Tea Party Movement. He's the

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:21.960
grandfather of it, if anything.

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:24.829
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: You don't know
is basically.

00:40:24.829 --> 00:40:27.589
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Yeah. Right.

00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:28.589
[laughter]

00:40:28.589 --> 00:40:30.819
There's no memo like going around.

00:40:30.819 --> 00:40:33.339
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: No, it's--. All
right. That's cool.

00:40:33.339 --> 00:40:34.339
[laughter]

00:40:34.339 --> 00:40:35.339
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Sorry.

00:40:35.339 --> 00:40:36.450
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Good question. Let's go over
here.

00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:37.450
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Yeah.

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:41.619
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: The control of
information has changed deeply in the last

00:40:41.619 --> 00:40:46.869
decade with the internet rising, every neighborhood
can transmit information and tweets and everything

00:40:46.869 --> 00:40:51.990
and whatnot. What do you see as the future
of news media, who's long held this information

00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:55.410
or control of it as they're now--things are
changing?

00:40:55.410 --> 00:40:56.410
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Right.

00:40:56.410 --> 00:40:57.410
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: What you see as
their future--.

00:40:57.410 --> 00:40:58.799
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Well, I hope you put a
stop to this.

00:40:58.799 --> 00:40:59.799
[laughter]

00:40:59.799 --> 00:41:00.799
I'm kidding.

00:41:00.799 --> 00:41:03.510
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: You're here to shut down Google
today, is that what you're saying?

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:06.299
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Exactly. Yes. This is all
part of my insidious plot. While you've all

00:41:06.299 --> 00:41:07.609
been away from your workstations--.

00:41:07.609 --> 00:41:08.609
[laughter]

00:41:08.609 --> 00:41:12.920
You've all been locked out and fired.

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:13.920
[laughter]

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:18.740
I really don't know and that's, I think, what's
exciting. It's scary for some people, but

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:26.700
I find it exciting. And I think, how will
the sharing of information change things?

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:32.099
Will we need broadcast networks? Will we need
cable networks, news networks? Will everything

00:41:32.099 --> 00:41:38.609
be online? Will we need television anchors?
That's why I'm getting a day job, frankly,

00:41:38.609 --> 00:41:40.480
in case that happens.
[laughter]

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:45.380
But I do think that's, I think anyone who
pretends to know where its going has no idea.

00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:49.180
I mean, I've talked to the people who run
these companies and I don't think they have

00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:54.839
a firm grasp of exactly where it's going.
So, I think right now, I can tell you CNN

00:41:54.839 --> 00:42:00.710
has certainly trying to be on as many platforms
as possible, on as many delivery systems as

00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:09.589
possible, to see what comes down the pike
and which one explodes, which one goes away.

00:42:09.589 --> 00:42:15.520
I do think that we're able to get information
from more sources than ever before and I think

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:21.180
that's been a fantastic thing. There's a danger,
I think, in it in not knowing where the information

00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:25.950
really is coming from and being in this echo
chamber where something is inserted online,

00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:31.390
something appears online and then it's picked
up by other, and it becomes real even though

00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:32.390
it's not real.

00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:37.150
And so, I do think it matters where the information
comes from and whether that information has

00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:42.700
been checked and vetted. We all know it. We've
all seen in Presidential elections and just

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:46.130
in news in general how stories take on a life
of their own.

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:52.920
I don't know if you remember the story about
President Obama going to India recently and

00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:56.520
there was this story going around that his
trip was gonna cost, I don't know, it was

00:42:56.520 --> 00:43:01.700
like 200 million dollars a day, or something.
And it was being repeated on radio stations,

00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:06.220
especially conservative radio stations, but
on television stations and it became--.

00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:13.710
I have Michelle Bachman on my program saying
this as fact. And I was like, "Where does

00:43:13.710 --> 00:43:16.599
this figure come from?" And she was like,
"Well, it's being reported in the media."

00:43:16.599 --> 00:43:21.500
Which, that doesn't mean anything. That's
like saying, "I found it on the street."

00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:22.500
[laughter]

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:29.410
So, we started checking and going back and
we traced it back to an unnamed Indian provincial

00:43:29.410 --> 00:43:36.829
government official quoted in a local Indian
paper. So, the credibility of that is, it

00:43:36.829 --> 00:43:37.829
just doesn't mean anything.

00:43:37.829 --> 00:43:44.150
Why would a provincial Indian government official,
unnamed, in a local paper know how much President

00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:48.289
Obama's security costs were when the White
House doesn't even release that information?

00:43:48.289 --> 00:43:52.829
And the war in Iraq costs, I don't know, 190
million dollars. So, it just didn't make any

00:43:52.829 --> 00:43:54.269
sense.

00:43:54.269 --> 00:43:58.769
So, we were able to just debunk that, but
it had taken on a life of its own. So, I do

00:43:58.769 --> 00:44:03.400
think it's important, even in this age where
information is more easily shared and more

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:09.230
easily accessible, that even no matter where
it goes, that I think there will be some need

00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:15.329
for, I don't wanna say gate keepers but for
vetting the information. And how that happens,

00:44:15.329 --> 00:44:19.490
whether you need the companies that currently
exist or whether it's some kind of new structure

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:26.400
or just individuals who are responsible. I
mean, I go to websites that I think I'd trust

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:30.370
or I think I value the opinion of the person
who's running those websites and I think they

00:44:30.370 --> 00:44:32.950
have certain standards.

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:39.190
And I think everybody has to come up in their
own mind with what they believe and what sources

00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:40.190
they actually trust.

00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:41.730
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Let's go over here.

00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:45.809
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: I'm one of the
folks in the audience who watched you on Channel

00:44:45.809 --> 00:44:46.809
One.

00:44:46.809 --> 00:44:47.809
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Oh, cool.

00:44:47.809 --> 00:44:48.809
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: In middle school,
so it's cool to have you here.

00:44:48.809 --> 00:44:49.809
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Where did you go to school?

00:44:49.809 --> 00:44:50.809
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: In Western Pennsylvania.
So when you said the Midwest, it makes a lot

00:44:50.809 --> 00:44:52.270
of sense. 'Cause nobody around here seems
to know what Channel One is.

00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:54.119
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Right. Exactly. [laughing]

00:44:54.119 --> 00:44:58.670
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: So, one of my favorite
tweets from the earthquake yesterday, big

00:44:58.670 --> 00:45:03.680
deal here, came from a sports writer. I think
he said, "Wolf Blitzer has the earthquake

00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:08.690
on the phone." Which is a little bit of a
criticism about the 24-hour news cycle and

00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:10.310
really trying to create stories out of what
is there.

00:45:10.310 --> 00:45:11.310
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Right.

00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:13.200
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: But your side work
at 60 Minutes really stands out to me because

00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:16.930
it's way more about those stories that do
have permanence, the stories that stick with

00:45:16.930 --> 00:45:20.910
you individually. So, I'm interested in how
you see things changing, if you see anything

00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:23.450
changing at 60 Minutes with your involvement?

00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:26.859
Some folks who are under the age of 60 are
getting involved over there.

00:45:26.859 --> 00:45:27.859
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Right.

00:45:27.859 --> 00:45:31.380
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: And how it's possible
that social media or citizen journalism feeds

00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:34.150
into the stories that have some of that permanence?

00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:38.040
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Right. I mean, I do think.
Look, I think 60 Minutes is more relevant

00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:41.339
and over the last few years has been more
relevant than perhaps ever before.

00:45:41.339 --> 00:45:47.789
And I think it's a testament to Jeff Fager
and Bill Owens and the producers who are there.

00:45:47.789 --> 00:45:54.640
I mean, it really, they've been breaking stories.
I mean, I think it's the best television news

00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:59.019
magazine show on the air that has ever been
and certainly is on currently.

00:45:59.019 --> 00:46:06.769
And so, for me to work there, to walk around
and see Morley Safer and Bob Simon and all

00:46:06.769 --> 00:46:10.339
these correspondents who I have great respect
for and to learn from their producers and

00:46:10.339 --> 00:46:14.740
being able to learn from them is an extraordinary
thing. And I still think I'm getting better

00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:16.799
at it and need to--.

00:46:16.799 --> 00:46:21.380
I still think I'm learning and that's what
makes it so exciting. But I think it's interesting

00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:28.220
how 60 Minutes has started to try to incorporate
online. I mean, 60 Minutes is, CBS in general

00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:37.480
is a very established, traditional outlet,
company. They're very slow to--. A lot of

00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:41.359
these companies are slow to really adapt and
figure out online components and things.

00:46:41.359 --> 00:46:45.720
60 Minutes has actually done--. They actually
have a full-time correspondent now who's excellent,

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:52.440
who creates--. There's this thing, 60 Minutes
Overtime, which exists only online. And it's

00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:55.569
all the interesting stuff that never actually
makes it into a 60 Minutes piece.

00:46:55.569 --> 00:47:02.250
It's the back story of how the piece was made.
And for instance, with Eminem, we showed how

00:47:02.250 --> 00:47:06.510
just doing a walk--. On 60 Minutes and a lot
of more traditional outlets, they do these

00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:10.380
walking shots, which are cheesy. It's like
the correspondent and the person walking down

00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:11.380
the street.

00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:15.750
And just in order to shoot this walking shot
with Eminem, it required this huge security

00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:21.599
undertaking 'cause it was at the home where
he grew up. And his whole entourage is there

00:47:21.599 --> 00:47:25.059
and there's elaborate security detail and
they had to rope off the block. So, it was

00:47:25.059 --> 00:47:27.759
all the back story on a lot of this stuff.

00:47:27.759 --> 00:47:34.000
And it's actually the more fun moments which
don't make it, naturally, into a 60 Minutes

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:39.230
piece, but you get value added if you're interested.
So, I think, for me, it seems like the networks

00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:44.580
right now, that's the use they see of these
in trying to again, build a community and

00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:46.470
build a sense of connection to a show like
that.

00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:47.470
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: Thanks.

00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:48.470
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Yep.

00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:51.829
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: Hi, Anderson. Thank
you for coming to Google. Back in October,

00:47:51.829 --> 00:47:58.269
I went to this little rally that was down
in D.C. and there was you, not you directly,

00:47:58.269 --> 00:48:02.759
but your clothing was a feature of the rally.
They gave your black t-shirt an award.

00:48:02.759 --> 00:48:03.759
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: My black t-shirt, yes.

00:48:03.759 --> 00:48:07.529
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: I was wondering
what you thought about the role that you place

00:48:07.529 --> 00:48:12.369
as a feedback system in in the media with
fear and with the things that they were counting

00:48:12.369 --> 00:48:13.810
on, do you think that the business is legitimate?

00:48:13.810 --> 00:48:17.480
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Yeah John actually asked
me to go to that and I would've like to. I

00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:18.839
actually couldn't 'cause I was working, but--

00:48:18.839 --> 00:48:22.190
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: The rally to restore fear at
the mall, right?

00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:26.490
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Right. Yes, yes, yes. Look,
first of all, I wear a black t-shirt or a

00:48:26.490 --> 00:48:34.400
dark t-shirt because--. The back story is
that there's no real thought to it other than

00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:37.890
you're not able to shower in a lot of places
and you're working in like, hundred degree

00:48:37.890 --> 00:48:38.890
temperatures.

00:48:38.890 --> 00:48:43.450
So, you're sweaty and dirty and rather than
having viewers email me saying, "Why are you

00:48:43.450 --> 00:48:47.241
showing us your sweat stains?" I wear a dark
t-shirt so that nobody sees my sweat stains.

00:48:47.241 --> 00:48:54.220
But it has certainly taken on a life of its
own and I think it's funny. So, I don't think

00:48:54.220 --> 00:49:01.640
I'm in any way trying to put fear into anybody's
heart or into anybody's head.

00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:07.650
If anything, I mean, I think for me the reason
to go down to Haiti and be there after the

00:49:07.650 --> 00:49:11.619
earthquake is not to--. It's not a story that
people are necessarily wanting to watch or

00:49:11.619 --> 00:49:16.140
are going to watch. I was just in Somalia
for a week. That's not a story.

00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:20.579
CNN doesn't send me to Somalia because they
think people are gonna want to watch it, or

00:49:20.579 --> 00:49:23.650
that people are even going to watch it. And
they're not because those are things people

00:49:23.650 --> 00:49:28.529
turn the channels from. But I do believe in
bearing witness to what's happening and I

00:49:28.529 --> 00:49:31.520
do believe in giving a voice to people who
have none.

00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:35.259
And in Haiti, for generations, people have
not had a voice or they had their voice silenced

00:49:35.259 --> 00:49:40.450
or taken away from them. And especially after
an earthquake, where the Haitian government

00:49:40.450 --> 00:49:47.059
is completely unable to even dig people out
of the rubble or even are unwilling to. I

00:49:47.059 --> 00:49:51.510
do think there's value in being there and
trying to show the rest of the world what

00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:53.099
is happening to a group of people.

00:49:53.099 --> 00:49:59.490
So for me, I don't think--. I certainly don't
think consciously, or even unconsciously,

00:49:59.490 --> 00:50:07.800
I'm trying to in any way make people fearful.
I do believe in bearing witness to struggles

00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:12.630
that other people aren't. And I've believed
in that from the first time I went to Burma

00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:14.400
and talked to students.

00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:18.299
It's not a conflict anyone seems to really
care much about, or not a lot people care

00:50:18.299 --> 00:50:22.170
much about. But I think it's valuable to be
there. I think it's valuable to give people

00:50:22.170 --> 00:50:23.170
voice.

00:50:23.170 --> 00:50:24.170
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Great.

00:50:24.170 --> 00:50:25.170
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: Thank you so much
for explaining.

00:50:25.170 --> 00:50:27.019
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: So speaking of
fashion, I wanted to know how your beautiful

00:50:27.019 --> 00:50:33.690
mother was and if you share her love of fashion
and what she thinks of you swimming in these

00:50:33.690 --> 00:50:34.690
shark infested waters.

00:50:34.690 --> 00:50:39.319
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: My mom is good. My mom
is Gloria Vanderbilt and she's 87 and she's

00:50:39.319 --> 00:50:45.289
great. She's in really good health. And she--.
I do not share her interest in fashion. I

00:50:45.289 --> 00:50:48.180
could care less about it. It really doesn't
interest me. I hate shopping.

00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:52.049
I always, for some reason, I still think when
I go into a store people think I'm stealing

00:50:52.049 --> 00:50:55.740
something. Does anybody else have this? I'm
convinced the sales people think I'm stealing

00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:59.750
something. And I literally feel like I have
to demonstrate to them like, "I'm looking

00:50:59.750 --> 00:51:00.750
at this shirt now."

00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:01.750
[laughter]

00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:10.109
I don't know why I feel this. I hope to work
this out at my daytime show. She's gotten

00:51:10.109 --> 00:51:15.950
used to me going off and doing weird things.
I mean, I said I left high school early and

00:51:15.950 --> 00:51:17.540
drove across sub-Saharan Africa in a truck.

00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:22.740
And I had been doing survival courses as a
very young kid before that in the wilderness

00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:30.259
for like, months at a time. So, she had gotten
used to this idea and she's really sweet about

00:51:30.259 --> 00:51:36.089
it 'cause I lie to her all the time when I'm
away. I was in Egypt and I was like, "I'm

00:51:36.089 --> 00:51:38.150
just gonna hang out by the pool in the hotel
today."

00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:42.000
And then, half an hour later I'm getting beat
up by thugs. And so--

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:43.800
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Does your mom watch YouTube?
'Cause she'll see this.

00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:47.390
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: I know. Yes, I know. She
knows about it by now. 'Cause then I'll have

00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:51.180
to call her up and be like, "All right. So
I decided not to hang out by the pool and

00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:56.319
I went outside and these people hit me in
the head. And you're gonna see it on TV, but

00:51:56.319 --> 00:51:57.319
it doesn't look as bad."

00:51:57.319 --> 00:52:00.240
I always it doesn't, it wasn't as bad as it
looks on TV, which is also not true 'cause

00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:01.240
it's usually worse. But.

00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:02.240
[laughter]

00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:03.999
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: You're digging a hole.

00:52:03.999 --> 00:52:09.589
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Yeah, but she's--. What's
remarkable about my mom is that she has never

00:52:09.589 --> 00:52:14.349
asked me not to do something. I mean, from
the time I was very little, even doing very

00:52:14.349 --> 00:52:20.580
extreme things, she was very supportive of
it and if she felt I was really passionate

00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:21.580
about it.

00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:22.580
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: Thank you.

00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:23.580
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Let's go over here.

00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:26.440
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #7: I have a question
about how you put your show together. How

00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:33.190
you decide at what stories to bring because
sometimes it's the more broad political agendas

00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:37.170
and then other times it goes much more into
being almost sensational news.

00:52:37.170 --> 00:52:42.119
So, how do you make these decisions? Or, is
it just you or the guidance at CNN?

00:52:42.119 --> 00:52:46.140
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: There's not really any
guidance from CNN. I mean, I generally do

00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:50.349
things which I'm interested in, which I think
other people are gonna be interested in. And

00:52:50.349 --> 00:52:55.049
it's a combination. And every day, we sit
around all day thinking of what are we gonna

00:52:55.049 --> 00:52:56.049
do today.

00:52:56.049 --> 00:53:02.240
And we try to start off the broadcast, if
there's not breaking news, with--. We have

00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:05.799
branded it at keeping it honest, but it basically
is what I think all reporters should be doing,

00:53:05.799 --> 00:53:11.200
which is basically just seeing public statements
that have been made and then holding people

00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:15.480
accountable for those statements if they're
correct or not, like the Obama trip to India

00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:16.480
costs thing.

00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:19.980
So, we usually try to lead off the broadcast
with a keeping them honest report if we don't

00:53:19.980 --> 00:53:26.519
have some breaking news. But something like
Syria is something I'm very passionate about

00:53:26.519 --> 00:53:33.480
and I think is important. And very few people
on television news are covering it on a regular

00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:35.499
sustained basis.

00:53:35.499 --> 00:53:39.750
And I think it's important that it get covered.
I had the idea that if you have thousands

00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:43.910
of people who are standing out for their dignity,
being shot to death in the streets by their

00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:50.920
own government, I think is abhorrent and deserves
coverage. Certainly there's some times there's

00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:56.339
stories that I may not be personally all that
interested in, or that I think are all that

00:53:56.339 --> 00:54:00.799
important in a geopolitical sense, but that
people are just genuinely interested.

00:54:00.799 --> 00:54:06.900
And look at the Casey Anthony trial. That's
a story that people were fascinated with and

00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:10.559
for all the people who say they weren't interested
in it, half of those people were still watching

00:54:10.559 --> 00:54:19.990
it. And you're in a news business and my job
is not to tell people to eat their broccoli

00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:20.990
every single night.

00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:25.309
Sometimes, if someone's interested in a story
and there's a high viewer interest in it,

00:54:25.309 --> 00:54:31.249
I'll do that story if we think we can do it
in an intelligent way. So, we try not to be

00:54:31.249 --> 00:54:37.119
sensationalistic about stuff. And I don't
know if there's something specific that you're

00:54:37.119 --> 00:54:45.319
referencing, but certainly everybody's responsible
just for their own little program and I can't

00:54:45.319 --> 00:54:50.130
take credit or responsibility for what else
is on cable news.

00:54:50.130 --> 00:54:56.970
But on my program, we try very hard not to
focus on stuff that's sensational. And what

00:54:56.970 --> 00:55:01.819
we found, frankly, over the years is that
for a CNN viewer, they're really not interested

00:55:01.819 --> 00:55:06.380
in sensational stories. I mean, if somebody's
really, really interested in crime stories,

00:55:06.380 --> 00:55:08.290
they can go to Nancy Grace on HLN.

00:55:08.290 --> 00:55:13.460
She covers what she covers. Or, they could
go to some of the other shows on HLN or elsewhere.

00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:17.430
Or, if they're interested in celebrity interviews,
they go to Pierce Morgan. People don't really

00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:23.619
come to me for that on CNN. They come now
because of the accountability things and also

00:55:23.619 --> 00:55:24.630
a lot of foreign coverage.

00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:30.509
So, I'm happy that I have that niche and that
viewers are actually coming for that. And

00:55:30.509 --> 00:55:31.589
so, that's what I'm able to do.

00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:32.589
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #7: Thanks.

00:55:32.589 --> 00:55:34.480
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: We have time for one more question
over here.

00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:39.070
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #8: Speaking on the
topic of where you think things might be going,

00:55:39.070 --> 00:55:44.819
or how you'd like them to go, but particularly
in the developing world where sometimes you're

00:55:44.819 --> 00:55:49.700
covering the stories, do you think that what
we see with Twitter and YouTube and these

00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:51.329
kind of things is making the kind of impact
it could and the affected populations in these

00:55:51.329 --> 00:55:52.329
areas?

00:55:52.329 --> 00:55:53.330
Are they getting the benefit of increased
coverage,

00:55:53.330 --> 00:55:54.410
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Right.

00:55:54.410 --> 00:55:58.749
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #8: or is it more just
to have people watching?

00:55:58.749 --> 00:56:03.670
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: I think it's hard to generalize.
I mean, I think it depends on each situation.

00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:08.819
But I think certainly some places in Haiti--.
I mean, in Haiti for instance, in the wake

00:56:08.819 --> 00:56:13.180
of the earthquake there were a lot of folks
online who were obviously very concerned and

00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:15.380
wanted to be involved and were trying to help
spread information.

00:56:15.380 --> 00:56:19.900
Like, "This person is trapped in this building."
And I would get these tweets. I would get

00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:25.779
these emails. I mean, thousands of them every
single day while I was down in Haiti for that

00:56:25.779 --> 00:56:32.230
month. And 99% of them are very well-intentioned.
A lot of them are just this echo chamber of

00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:36.119
somebody else has put this email out there.

00:56:36.119 --> 00:56:39.630
And it's been picked up by ten other concerned
people and then it's been forwarded and it's

00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:44.690
taken on a life of its own. And it grows in
hysteria to the point where you get an email

00:56:44.690 --> 00:56:48.840
from a very serious sounding person who's
saying there are kids who are crushed and

00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:55.829
starving in this orphanage and they're at
28, and they give the address, and you drive

00:56:55.829 --> 00:57:01.239
for half a day to get there only to learn
that actually the kids are fine here.

00:57:01.239 --> 00:57:05.030
It's not a great situation, but they have
enough food for two or three weeks and it's

00:57:05.030 --> 00:57:09.569
not what it was made into. And we've had a
number of those situations where we've actually

00:57:09.569 --> 00:57:17.259
responded to things which came to us with
the best of intentions. So, it can be an issue.

00:57:17.259 --> 00:57:23.910
It can also be somebody trapped underneath
a house can send out an email and their loved

00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:29.450
one can see it and relief can come, help can
come. And that has happened as well. So, it's

00:57:29.450 --> 00:57:34.940
a case by case basis. But I do think overall,
I mean, it’s incredible, positive, that

00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:38.930
I think any way you can engage people, any
way you can get people to focus on--.

00:57:38.930 --> 00:57:44.119
Everyone's so busy and they don't have time
necessarily to even sit and watch a news clip.

00:57:44.119 --> 00:57:49.619
But to read a headline online that maybe spurs
them to do something. Or, there's just extraordinary

00:57:49.619 --> 00:57:54.999
things being done by Google and on Google
and by YouTube, helping people coordinate

00:57:54.999 --> 00:57:59.099
and helping people organize and I mean, I
know people from Google who went down to Haiti

00:57:59.099 --> 00:58:04.349
and I don't know what they were doing, but
something on the computer to help--

00:58:04.349 --> 00:58:05.999
[laughter]

00:58:05.999 --> 00:58:16.430
I'm a total Luddite. I'm there with my quill
pen and I see them with laptops, but to help

00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:22.049
data storage and to help organize what stuff
is coming in and what's going out. I mean,

00:58:22.049 --> 00:58:23.089
that's incredible.

00:58:23.089 --> 00:58:27.880
And it really is revolutionizing the way aid
is delivered. And it can really revolutionize

00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:32.089
things and I think it's incredibly exciting
to see because it really does have an impact

00:58:32.089 --> 00:58:37.150
on the ground. I mean, just one quick example.
I was in Haiti when eight days after the quake,

00:58:37.150 --> 00:58:44.049
a woman, an elderly woman, I think she was
in her 70s was found alive, trapped by a building

00:58:44.049 --> 00:58:45.049
near the Cathedral.

00:58:45.049 --> 00:58:48.319
She had been trapped under the wreckage for
eight days. And it was incredible that she

00:58:48.319 --> 00:58:52.770
was still alive. And she gets pulled out by
some South African and Mexican search and

00:58:52.770 --> 00:58:58.800
rescue people, but they were so excited and
elated that they pulled her out, no one had

00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:01.230
thought of the next step of, "Well, what do
we do with her now?"

00:59:01.230 --> 00:59:07.980
And there were no real--. Her pelvis was crushed,
I think. Part of her leg was crushed. And

00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:13.599
she needed life support and she needed surgery
immediately. And there was no place to take

00:59:13.599 --> 00:59:17.990
her. And they had no knowledge of where there
was a doctor who could actually perform the

00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:19.849
kind of surgery she needed.

00:59:19.849 --> 00:59:26.299
And we ended up, I mean, me, my team of two
other people ended up in this weird position

00:59:26.299 --> 00:59:33.749
where we found ourselves with her in the back
of our truck, on a stretcher, trying to mobilize

00:59:33.749 --> 00:59:38.140
people online and mobilize resources over
the phone that we could bring her to.

00:59:38.140 --> 00:59:45.500
And we ended up getting her on board a US
Coast Guard helicopter that landed on the

00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:49.910
Presidential Palace that had been destroyed.
And my producer is on the front lawn waving

00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:56.670
the chopper in with his BlackBerry light.
And I mean, that shouldn't happen. And so,

00:59:56.670 --> 00:59:59.980
the ability to connect people who are on the
ground, 'cause when you're on the ground you

00:59:59.980 --> 01:00:01.710
have no way of really sharing information.

01:00:01.710 --> 01:00:06.130
And I think that's the next step--the ability
for in real-time, people who are on the ground

01:00:06.130 --> 01:00:10.279
to connect information and connect resources.
That would be an extraordinary step.

01:00:10.279 --> 01:00:12.320
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Well, Anderson. Thanks for
coming today.

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:13.320
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: Cool. Thank you.

01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:14.320
[applause]

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:18.549
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Before we let you go, we want
to give you an essential pair of YouTube tube

01:00:18.549 --> 01:00:19.549
socks.

01:00:19.549 --> 01:00:20.650
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: That's fine. That's great.

01:00:20.650 --> 01:00:23.099
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: I'm sure you'll wear them the
next time you're out here.

01:00:23.099 --> 01:00:25.039
&gt;&gt;ANDERSON COOPER: I will. I'll wear them
with my black t-shirt. Thank you.

01:00:25.039 --> 01:00:27.640
&gt;&gt;STEVE GROVE: Your talk show start September
12th.
