and you know I wrote a book about a

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:22.119
and you know I wrote a book about a
 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:24.269
and you know I wrote a book about a
group of grad students at Berkeley who

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:24.279
group of grad students at Berkeley who
 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:26.670
group of grad students at Berkeley who
were trying to program a computer to

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:26.680
were trying to program a computer to
 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.669
were trying to program a computer to
have common sense in particular that was

know who had given his computer a

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860
know who had given his computer a
 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.000
know who had given his computer a
problem which was that the computer you

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010
problem which was that the computer you
 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.420
problem which was that the computer you
know was where anthropomorphize in here

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430
know was where anthropomorphize in here
 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.039

a bit but the computer woke up in the

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:44.049
a bit but the computer woke up in the
 

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:45.719
a bit but the computer woke up in the
morning and it looked outside and it saw

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:45.729
morning and it looked outside and it saw
 

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:47.700
morning and it looked outside and it saw
that it was raining and had to decide to

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710
that it was raining and had to decide to
 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.259
that it was raining and had to decide to
put on a ring cut before it went outside

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269
put on a ring cut before it went outside
 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:51.180
put on a ring cut before it went outside
so really the whole book and away was

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190
so really the whole book and away was
 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.950
so really the whole book and away was
about this guy trying to get his

them was you know Henry Dreyfuss who
 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.940
them was you know Henry Dreyfuss who
argued that this approach wasn't going

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950

computers are you know begin to show
 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.060
computers are you know begin to show
emergent intelligence and that seems to

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070
emergent intelligence and that seems to
 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.000

where that goes but it's certainly it's

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420
where that goes but it's certainly it's
 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.300
where that goes but it's certainly it's
certainly a long way from where it was

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310
certainly a long way from where it was
 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.210
certainly a long way from where it was
when I was writing
