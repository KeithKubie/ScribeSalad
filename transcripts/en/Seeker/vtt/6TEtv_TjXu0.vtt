00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.940
When you look a bear in the eyes, there's
an intelligent animal behind that.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:13.440
And that's, I think, an appreciation that in my case has evolved over time.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.480
I'm a wildlife biologist and work on grizzly
bears in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.760
It's a humbling experience, because you know there's something way more powerful than you are,

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.460
out on this landscape.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.980
- Can you guard his head? Okay.
- We gotta get this leg out underneath.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.080
This bear was close to 500 pounds.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.030
I was inside the culvert trap, so I was making sure that, as we take the animal out of the trap,

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.780
that the head is well-protected.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.800
And there's really two primary things that
go through my head: foremost, the safety of the animals

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.300
and the second thing is the safety of our personnel, as well.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.600
It is possible that a
loud sound, for example, will just temporarily,

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.460
just a split second, arouse the animal, and
it might actually raise up

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.140
and sometimes they have this spontaneous response.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.360
I always had an interest in large carnivores, especially because I grew up in Western Europe

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.480
where they didn't exist, and it almost felt like something was missing

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.960
in the place I lived.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.180
I started working for the Grizzly Bear Study Team in 2012.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.860
I had worked on black bears in Tennessee for over 20 years prior to that.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.120
For a bear biologist, working on grizzly bears in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.720
is like the epitome of what you could accomplish, and so I have to pinch myself all the time,

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.820
it's like, "wow, I get to do this... for my job!"

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.080
The Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team was established back in 1973,

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.980
so we've been in existence for a long time.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:14.200
And it is composed of eight agency partners,
federal, state, and tribal agencies, that

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:21.819
work together to basically monitor the status
of the Yellowstone grizzly bear population.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.300
Grizzly bears in the lower 48 were listed
as threatened in 1975,

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.180
under the Endangered Species Act.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.860
I think that interagency collaboration has
been absolutely critical to the success of the science.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:42.000
And I think that's the reason that we now
have a population that is biologically recovered.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.060
So when we have a capture like this, we get all our equipment close by.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.240
The first thing we check for is: are there any other bears roaming around?

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.500
It could be that we've captured a female and her yearlings or two-year-olds are hanging around,

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.720
or vice versa. Those are situations
that we really try to be very aware of

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.960
before we get close to the trap.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.380
Now this is a healthy individual - it's a
close to 500-pound male bear.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:21.340
Bears are individualistic as humans are, and their responses while they're in a trap like this

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.340
can be extremely different from one bear to another.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.680
- Slow and easy. Oxygen stays on the bear.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:35.720
Some bears will kind of let out this roar
and that can be very intimidating, in fact.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.040
Sometimes they will claw at the inside of
the trap,

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.960
and in most instances, bears are actually, like in this case, relatively calm.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:49.120
Then we estimate the weight of the bear that is inside the culvert trap, and that allows us

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.200
to make sure that we administer just the right amount of immobilization drug

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.660
to be able to handle that particular bear.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:07.520
After carefully checking that the bear is
indeed immobilized, we open the trap,

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.660
and we have roughly about an hour for the entire handling.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.880
So that includes body measurements, body weight.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.840
- Pulse is 119.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:22.280
We also collect some samples, like hair samples, where we can get information in terms of their genetics -

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.800
we can identify each individual bear based on genetics alone, and we can develop family relationships,

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.640
from that information, with other bears that we capture.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:38.360
We now also routinely use GPS tracking collars, that are linked up via satellite, so we can

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.000
actually track these individual bears, almost in real time.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.780
We do telemetry flights to monitor those animals at least twice a month, so we can get a status

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.220
of where they are; whether they're still alive or not.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.650
That type of information is absolutely critical to assessing the changes that have occurred

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.060
in this population over time.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:08.860
It's so important for us to do something useful
with that data that we get from the research.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.030
That's when the science becomes real.

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.360
And so there's quite a bit of computer time involved,

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:20.020
and that actually turns out also to be very
gratifying, because you kind of see patterns

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.960
in that, that some of us would have never
expected to see.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.590
When we are done with the handling, we put the animal back into the trap for recovery,

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.240
and then typically release the animal later
in the evening of that same day.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.920
We may never hear or see of it again. And
so making sure that the effort was worthwhile -

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:45.340
it's very important that we get as much information as we possibly can on this particular animal

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.880
because it may be the only time that we ever catch this particular animal.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:01.280
It says a lot about us as a nation, to want
to protect and recover a population like this,

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:06.050
of animals that could potentially harm, injure,
and even kill people.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:13.740
And I think that notion is really kind of
key to how much we value the conservation

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.380
of these large predators on the landscape,
as a nation.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:23.720
I really see it as a privilege for me to be able to do this work.
