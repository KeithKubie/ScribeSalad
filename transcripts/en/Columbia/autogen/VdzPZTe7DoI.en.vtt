look like me and myself i'll just put it

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:37.330
look like me and myself i'll just put it
 

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:40.499
look like me and myself i'll just put it
that way and so in many ways is it's

00:25:40.499 --> 00:25:40.509
that way and so in many ways is it's
 

00:25:40.509 --> 00:25:43.259
that way and so in many ways is it's
it's to me when we talk about diversity

00:25:43.259 --> 00:25:43.269
it's to me when we talk about diversity
 

00:25:43.269 --> 00:25:45.419
it's to me when we talk about diversity
within some context it's almost like a

00:25:45.419 --> 00:25:45.429
within some context it's almost like a
 

00:25:45.429 --> 00:25:49.109
within some context it's almost like a
publicity campaign sort of thing where

00:25:49.109 --> 00:25:49.119
publicity campaign sort of thing where
 

00:25:49.119 --> 00:25:50.639
publicity campaign sort of thing where
you know it's just something that you

00:25:50.639 --> 00:25:50.649
you know it's just something that you
 

00:25:50.649 --> 00:25:53.999
you know it's just something that you
have to go as a part of the trademark or

00:25:53.999 --> 00:25:54.009
have to go as a part of the trademark or
 

00:25:54.009 --> 00:25:59.099
have to go as a part of the trademark or
the brand of the organization and so it

00:25:59.099 --> 00:25:59.109
the brand of the organization and so it
 

00:25:59.109 --> 00:26:00.629
the brand of the organization and so it
sort of raises questions particularly

00:26:00.629 --> 00:26:00.639
sort of raises questions particularly
 

00:26:00.639 --> 00:26:02.129
sort of raises questions particularly
looking at it from this historical

00:26:02.129 --> 00:26:02.139
looking at it from this historical
 

00:26:02.139 --> 00:26:04.649
looking at it from this historical
context the question I begin to ask in

00:26:04.649 --> 00:26:04.659
context the question I begin to ask in
 

00:26:04.659 --> 00:26:07.019
context the question I begin to ask in
this very personal way is that who is

00:26:07.019 --> 00:26:07.029
this very personal way is that who is
 

00:26:07.029 --> 00:26:10.680
this very personal way is that who is
diversity really for right is it for

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:10.690
diversity really for right is it for
 

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:12.599
diversity really for right is it for
those who are trying to you talk about

00:26:12.599 --> 00:26:12.609
those who are trying to you talk about
 

00:26:12.609 --> 00:26:15.930
those who are trying to you talk about
powered maintain power and it's

00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:15.940
powered maintain power and it's
 

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:18.029
powered maintain power and it's
something nothing you know my son and

00:26:18.029 --> 00:26:18.039
something nothing you know my son and
 

00:26:18.039 --> 00:26:18.480
something nothing you know my son and
I'm

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:18.490
I'm
 

00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:21.279
I'm
sonic diversity we do want difference

00:26:21.279 --> 00:26:21.289
sonic diversity we do want difference
 

00:26:21.289 --> 00:26:24.490
sonic diversity we do want difference
but it seems that we're getting back at

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:24.500
but it seems that we're getting back at
 

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:26.289
but it seems that we're getting back at
least within this context in this very

00:26:26.289 --> 00:26:26.299
least within this context in this very
 

00:26:26.299 --> 00:26:28.149

had been addressed to liberalism as such
 

00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:55.010
had been addressed to liberalism as such
and turning it into a problem legitimacy

00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:55.020
and turning it into a problem legitimacy
 

00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:57.680
and turning it into a problem legitimacy

table so so what surprised that
diversity has these functions it is

00:47:07.609 --> 00:47:07.619
diversity has these functions it is
 

00:47:07.619 --> 00:47:11.000
diversity has these functions it is
itself an effect of a very interesting

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:11.010
itself an effect of a very interesting

legitimacy crisis that's absolutely 50s

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:21.390
legitimacy crisis that's absolutely 50s
 

00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:25.420
legitimacy crisis that's absolutely 50s
60s 70s and boom in 70s after those 50s

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:25.430
60s 70s and boom in 70s after those 50s
 

00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:28.510
60s 70s and boom in 70s after those 50s
and you can globalize it you get the 70s

00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:28.520
and you can globalize it you get the 70s
 

00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:31.540
and you can globalize it you get the 70s
and which we can start having all the

00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:31.550
and which we can start having all the
 

00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:36.640

00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:40.390
debates about tolerance word conclusion
is a level up so how do we have a

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:40.400
is a level up so how do we have a
 

00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:42.460
is a level up so how do we have a

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:48.250
of the shift how it is yeah i'm not sure
that normative with transformation or

00:47:48.250 --> 00:47:48.260
that normative with transformation or
 

00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:51.490
that normative with transformation or
what it is but that's what's cool

00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:51.500
what it is but that's what's cool

this i'm actually one of the reasons we

00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:00.950
this i'm actually one of the reasons we
 

00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:04.150
this i'm actually one of the reasons we
wanted agri here was thinking about

00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:04.160
wanted agri here was thinking about
 

00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:06.250
wanted agri here was thinking about
having your talk about tolerance and i

00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:06.260
having your talk about tolerance and i
 

00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:07.510

think when we originally brought up the

00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:07.520
think when we originally brought up the
 

00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:09.040
think when we originally brought up the
idea of inviting you to be part of this

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:09.050
idea of inviting you to be part of this
 

00:48:09.050 --> 00:48:11.380
idea of inviting you to be part of this
but we can use that as the key word but

00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:11.390
but we can use that as the key word but
 

00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:14.140
but we can use that as the key word but
I thought diversity was something that

00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:14.150
I thought diversity was something that
 

00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:17.349
I thought diversity was something that
had built into it then Oregon you see

00:48:17.349 --> 00:48:17.359
had built into it then Oregon you see
 

00:48:17.359 --> 00:48:21.400
had built into it then Oregon you see
Morgan definition is I'm beyond to be on

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:21.410
Morgan definition is I'm beyond to be on
 

00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:24.339
Morgan definition is I'm beyond to be on
time so so there's that kind of

00:48:24.339 --> 00:48:24.349
time so so there's that kind of
 

00:48:24.349 --> 00:48:26.650
time so so there's that kind of
liberalism but the other thing just to

00:48:26.650 --> 00:48:26.660
liberalism but the other thing just to
 

00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:28.730
liberalism but the other thing just to
come back to things

00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:28.740
come back to things
 

00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:33.350
come back to things
to keep this term isn't it has had very
