00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.310
Now, I'd like you to use one
assistive technology and

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.230
complete a task with one of your
favorite mobile apps or websites.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.200
If you're using Mac,
you can open System Preferences and

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.560
then click on Accessibility.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.430
You might try to invert colors or
use grayscale or

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.286
you could play around with these other
options, such as Zoom and Voiceover.

00:00:21.286 --> 00:00:23.288
As you use one of
the accessibility tools,

00:00:23.288 --> 00:00:25.628
I'd like you to answer
the following questions.

00:00:25.628 --> 00:00:28.140
Can you find all of
the critical content?

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.440
Can you navigate the page or

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.110
the application and
find the links that you want?

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.500
And finally, can you actually
complete the chosen task?

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.940
This will help you get into
the mindset of your users and

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.910
develop empathy for them.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.589
You'll get a quick sense about which
products are accessible and useable for

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:45.296
most users and which ones aren't.

00:00:45.296 --> 00:00:48.200
Once you've done this task,
check this box to continue.
