00:00:00.435 --> 00:00:05.402
Let's say we have two
banks, bank A and bank B,

00:00:05.402 --> 00:00:08.208
and you might already know
that banks, all banks,

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:11.188
lend out the great
majority of the money that

00:00:11.188 --> 00:00:13.680
they get in as deposits,
but they keep some of

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.469
the money as reserves.

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:17.554
One, just in case their
depositor comes and hey,

00:00:17.554 --> 00:00:20.177
can I have some of my
money back and two because

00:00:20.177 --> 00:00:22.349
the central bank, the Federal Reserve,

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:24.935
says you have to keep a certain amount of

00:00:24.935 --> 00:00:26.720
your deposits in reserve.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.441
There is a reserve requirement,
but you can imagine

00:00:29.441 --> 00:00:31.736
over the course of doing transactions,

00:00:31.736 --> 00:00:35.068
thousands of transactions
a day, millions maybe,

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:37.411
maybe bank B more of
its depositors come by

00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:40.277
and say hey, give me
some of my deposits back.

00:00:40.277 --> 00:00:42.473
Obviously he's lent out a
lot of that money and so

00:00:42.473 --> 00:00:44.886
he starts running low on reserves.

00:00:44.886 --> 00:00:46.769
Maybe bank A, the depositors haven't asked

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:48.763
for the money or for
whatever reason Bank A is

00:00:48.763 --> 00:00:50.532
sitting on a lot of cash.

00:00:50.532 --> 00:00:52.463
In this situation, what
you're going to have

00:00:52.463 --> 00:00:55.744
happen is bank A is going
to lend some reserves,

00:00:55.744 --> 00:00:59.388
is going to lend some cash to bank B.

00:00:59.388 --> 00:01:02.246
This is lending some
cash and they'll charge

00:01:02.246 --> 00:01:04.416
an interest rate for lending that cash.

00:01:04.416 --> 00:01:08.410
Maybe it will be 5%
interest and that won't be

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.600
5% per day and usually
these loans are on a

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.825
per day basis and then
the next day it'll be

00:01:13.825 --> 00:01:16.079
renegotiated on a per
day basis, but it's not

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:17.537
5% per day.

00:01:17.537 --> 00:01:21.333
It'll be 5% per year, so
it will be a much smaller

00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:24.080
fraction, but usually as
I mentioned this lending

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.534
takes place on a per day basis.

00:01:25.534 --> 00:01:28.803
We'll say hey, this is
your cash for just tonight.

00:01:28.803 --> 00:01:31.271
If you need it for the
next night, we'll talk

00:01:31.271 --> 00:01:33.464
again and maybe it will
be another 5% or maybe

00:01:33.464 --> 00:01:36.016
the interest rate can change again.

00:01:36.016 --> 00:01:38.770
Let's say the Federal
Reserve is sitting over here

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.870
and for whatever reason wants to stimulate

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.005
the economy.

00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:44.804
This is the Fed and they want to stimulate

00:01:44.804 --> 00:01:47.957
the economy so they start
printing some money.

00:01:47.957 --> 00:01:49.941
I should do money in green.

00:01:49.941 --> 00:01:53.283
The Federal Reserve
here, they're starting to

00:01:53.283 --> 00:01:55.403
print some money and they
want to do two things.

00:01:55.403 --> 00:01:58.199
They want to inject this money into the

00:01:58.199 --> 00:02:00.060
banking system which
essentially, hopefully,

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.292
will find its way into
the economy and they also

00:02:03.292 --> 00:02:05.616
want to lower the
interest rate, especially

00:02:05.616 --> 00:02:07.266
the short term interest rate.

00:02:07.266 --> 00:02:09.178
This overnight borrowing.

00:02:09.178 --> 00:02:11.034
Remember this is the annual interest rate,

00:02:11.034 --> 00:02:13.532
but this is an overnight loan.

00:02:13.532 --> 00:02:17.035
Overnight loan.

00:02:17.035 --> 00:02:19.256
When I talk about the
short term interest rate,

00:02:19.256 --> 00:02:21.367
I'm talking about the
interest rate on loans

00:02:21.367 --> 00:02:24.403
that are made over very
short periods of time.

00:02:24.403 --> 00:02:26.471
What the Federal Reserve
will do is what's called

00:02:26.471 --> 00:02:28.428
open market operations.

00:02:28.428 --> 00:02:30.870
They will go to the market and maybe

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.731
directly to these banks
or some other banks

00:02:32.731 --> 00:02:34.867
and they will buy treasuries.

00:02:34.867 --> 00:02:37.027
They will give this
money to the market and

00:02:37.027 --> 00:02:39.364
in exchange, they will
usually buy treasury

00:02:39.364 --> 00:02:40.401
securities.

00:02:40.401 --> 00:02:42.201
Sometimes something
slightly different, but

00:02:42.201 --> 00:02:43.855
usually very safe
securities and maybe it's

00:02:43.855 --> 00:02:45.357
temporarily buy.

00:02:45.357 --> 00:02:47.535
I'll take about repurchase
agreements in the future.

00:02:47.535 --> 00:02:50.383
What happens is that this
cash goes in the hands

00:02:50.383 --> 00:02:52.334
of the people who just sold the treasury

00:02:52.334 --> 00:02:56.071
securities and they have
to deposit it in banks.

00:02:56.071 --> 00:02:58.032
They might deposit it
in this bank over here.

00:02:58.032 --> 00:03:00.111
They might deposit it
in this bank over here

00:03:00.111 --> 00:03:02.608
or other banks, but the
net-net effect is that there's

00:03:02.608 --> 00:03:04.613
more cash now in the banking system.

00:03:04.613 --> 00:03:06.830
If there's more cash
in the banking system,

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.268
this guy right over here needs less.

00:03:10.268 --> 00:03:14.467
This guy needs less cash,
so it lowers demand.

00:03:14.467 --> 00:03:16.802
It lowers the demand for
cash and then this guy

00:03:16.802 --> 00:03:19.867
has more to give, so it raises supply.

00:03:19.867 --> 00:03:22.802
Raises the supply
because some people maybe

00:03:22.802 --> 00:03:24.194
just took some of this cash and deposited

00:03:24.194 --> 00:03:25.154
with them.

00:03:25.154 --> 00:03:27.360
If it raises the supply
of cash and this guy

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.622
needs it less, then the
rate to borrow this cash

00:03:30.622 --> 00:03:32.948
is going to go down.

00:03:32.948 --> 00:03:37.416
Maybe instead of 5%, it's goes down to 4%.

00:03:37.416 --> 00:03:39.447
What that would do is it would lower the

00:03:39.447 --> 00:03:41.944
short term of the yield
curve, the short end

00:03:41.944 --> 00:03:42.803
of the yield curve.

00:03:42.803 --> 00:03:46.466
Let me draw a yield curve right over here.

00:03:46.466 --> 00:03:51.333
This is maturity on
this axis, maturity, and

00:03:51.333 --> 00:03:52.871
this is yield.

00:03:52.871 --> 00:03:56.532
Let's say the yield curve
before looked like this.

00:03:56.532 --> 00:03:58.284
Let's say it looked like this where this

00:03:58.284 --> 00:04:03.300
right over here is 5% and this overnight.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.618
Overnight.

00:04:04.618 --> 00:04:08.017
This might be yield on, I
don't know, one year debt.

00:04:08.017 --> 00:04:10.270
This might be yield on, I don't know,

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.006
maybe it's five year debt.

00:04:12.006 --> 00:04:14.538
Whatever, I could keep
going, but by doing this

00:04:14.538 --> 00:04:16.402
open market operation,
the Fed was able to do

00:04:16.402 --> 00:04:17.729
both of its goals.

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.811
It was able to inject
cash, printed cash, into

00:04:20.811 --> 00:04:23.037
the economy and it's also able to lower

00:04:23.037 --> 00:04:24.466
the interest rate.

00:04:24.466 --> 00:04:27.996
It took it from being 5% to down to 4%.

00:04:27.996 --> 00:04:31.502
Now because of this open market operation,

00:04:31.502 --> 00:04:34.073
the Fed, the yield curve
might start to look

00:04:34.073 --> 00:04:37.000
something like that.
