00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.250
&gt;&gt; Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to the Library of Congress

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.620 position:56%
and to this event -- a conversation
about the novel "Un paese di carta".

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:36.290
I am Grant Harris, I'm head of
the European Reading Room here

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.740
at the Library of Congress -- not
in this building, the Madison,

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.510
but in the Jefferson
across the street.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.530
The library is very pleased
to sponsor this event today,

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.940 position:56%
and we do so in partnership with the
library's Italian Language Table,

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.750
and more importantly,
with the Italian Embassy,

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.120
the Italian Cultural Institute,
and especially with the author,

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.880
Dr. Laura Benedetti, from
Georgetown University,

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.980
and reporter Emily Langer
of the "Washington Post".

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.010
The novel we will discuss today
has many interesting facets,

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.160
but let me add one to that.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.650
The novel refers to an area in
Central Italy called Abruzzo,

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.520
which neighbors the area struck
by the earthquake just a week ago.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.840
Abruzzo, and in particular,
its major city, L'Aquila,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.730
from which Dr. Benedetti hails,

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.250
was hit by an equally
devastating earthquake in 2009.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.520
The Library of Congress is proud
of its Italian collections,

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.480
possibly the largest such
collections outside of Italy.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:51.560
Lucia Wolfe, sitting in the front
row, is our specialist for Italy.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.010
And if you want to research
nearly any aspect of Italy,

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.360
please come back and
talk to Lucia any time.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.860
In just a minute, I will have
Lucia introduce today's speakers.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.030
I'll hold the floor for
just another minute here.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.680
Let me say that we hope you
enjoy the discussion today

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.540
and that you will come back
to use our collections.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.070
Again, I thank all who have
made this event possible.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.020
I would now invite to the podium
the library's Italian specialist,

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.320
Lucia Wolfe.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.490
&gt;&gt; It looks like I'm going
to have to do something here.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:29.790
Can you hear me?

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.090
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.440
&gt;&gt; OK. So I am Lucia Wolfe and
I'm the reference librarian

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.280
for the Italian collections
at the European division.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.980
Today's event is a very
special occasion --

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.290
the presentation of Dr. Laura
Benedetti's first novel,

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.170
"Un paese di carta".

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.750
I will leave it to her to
translate the title in English.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.000
I had something approximately
-- a country of paper --

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.450 position:56%
but it could be a town of paper too.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.800
But to an American audience,
the most important thing

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.850
for me is the promotion of
Italian culture and language

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.560 position:56%
through our vast Italian collections
at the Library of Congress,

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.440
which I am very proud to say
is close to 400,000 items.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.720
Although it is impossible to
come up with an exact count.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.060
The promotion of the
Italian collections is one

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.170
of the most important and
exciting parts of my profession

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.410
because it allows for the
connection between the collections

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.840
and the communities
that the library serves.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.590 position:56%
As Grant mentioned, the Library of
Congress is one of the few libraries

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.810 position:56%
in the world with the largest number
of Italian items in its collections.

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.340 position:56%
These hundreds of thousands of items
are spread across all divisions

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.590
and come in all formats: prints
and photographs, music scores,

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.410
manuscripts, maps, sound
recordings, motion pictures,

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.390
in addition to the large number
of printed books and periodicals.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:07.370
Dr. Benedetti's novel, the
subject of our presentation today,

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:08.870
is one of the many books written

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:14.310
by interesting contemporary Italian
authors in our general collections.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.990
And for the Americans
in our audience,

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.620
I might add that many
English translations

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.800
of Italian authors are also
present in our vast collections.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.160
The Italian holdings at the
Library of Congress increase

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.920
by the thousands every
year with new items

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.140
from Italy's current
publishing scene,

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.160
of which Dr. Benedetti's
novel is one.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.640
Personally, I can attest to
this because I have the honor

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.190
to be the person who selects

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.900
and recommends the new
acquisitions from Italy.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.610
Thank you all for allowing me this
short promotion of the Library

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.060
of Congress' collections to elicit
your interest and patronage.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.520
Now to our guest speaker.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:02.260
Dr. Laura Benedetti holds a laude
summa cum laude from the University

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.780
of Rome-La Sapienza, a master's
from the University of Alberta,

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.260
and Ph.D. from Johns
Hopkins University.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.410
She taught for eight
years at Harvard

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.490
where she was the John
Loeb Associate Professor

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:23.980
for the Humanities before
joining Georgetown in 2002.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.800
Her publications include
"La sconfitta di Diana.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.030 position:56%
Un percorso per la Gerusalemme
liberata", "The Tigress in the Snow:

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:38.010
Motherhood and Literature in
20th-Century Italy", the addition

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:43.000
and translation of one of
Italy's earliest women writers,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.350
Lucrezia Marinella, "Esortazioni
alle donne e agli altri",

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.960
and most recently,
"Un paese di carta".

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.830
Incidentally, all of these
books by Dr. Benedetti are

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.110
in the library's collections.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.000
She has been the guest of
honor at annual meetings

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.980
of the American Association
of Italian Studies as well

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:07.790
as the recipient of various awards:
the Flaiano International Prize

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.740 position:56%
for Italian Studies, the Wise Woman
Award from the National Organization

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.570
of Italian-American
Women, and the gold medal

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:22.000
from the Federazione Associazioni
Abruzzesi U.S.A. She is currently

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.510
associate editor and book review
editor of Italian Culture:

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.780
The Journal of the American
Association of Italian Studies.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:33.370
Our next guest speaker is Emily
Langer, a reporter with the

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:37.220
"Washington Post" where she works
on the obituaries desk and says

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.660
about her work, "Every day I
have the opportunity to delve

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.380
into a different life:
a writer, a scientist,

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.210
an artist, a doctor, and so on."

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.880
She also writes occasionally
feature stories

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.850
for the newspaper including
two articles about a pair

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:59.140
of Italian sisters who survived
the Holocaust as very young girls.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.900
Finally, she is a graduate
of the Italian Department

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.400
at Georgetown University.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:08.570
And in 2010-2011 was a Fulbright
fellow in Trieste, Italy.

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:12.030
And now, I will leave
you to our presentation.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.510
Thank you all.

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:18.040
[ Applause ]

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.380
So thank you so much, all
of you, for being here.

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.350
Thank you to Lucia and
to Grant for having us.

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:27.600
But most of all, thank you, Laura,
for writing this magnificent book.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.950
I was Laura's student 14 years ago

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.500
at the Italian Department
of Georgetown.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.260
And it was my first day at
Georgetown and her first day

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:41.080
at Georgetown, and I stumbled into
her class about the Italian writer,

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.550
Italo Calvino, who by the
way, figures in this novel,

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:46.940
and I've been hanging
around ever since.

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:50.800
So I'm very glad to be
here with her today.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.510
So as Grant said, Laura
is from L'Aquila,

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:58.990
which you probably remember was hit
by a terrible earthquake in 2009.

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:02.470
And I wanted to ask you
first, given what you know

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:05.480
about L'Aquila's experience,
what does Amatrice face

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.060
in the next number
of years recovering

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:11.650
from the earthquake last week?

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:17.220
&gt;&gt; Well, first of all, L'Aquila
is only 30 miles from Amatrice,

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:22.590
so the quake brought back
some very sad memories

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:26.560
and also created some new
damage in L'Aquila as well.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.480
As far as Amatrice is concerned,

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:33.720
of course there the devastation
is terrible, but I hear,

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.100
there's strong determination
from the people

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:40.010
of Amatrice to rebuild their town.

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:41.980
And now I also hear
from the government

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:45.920
that the model was
followed for L'Aquila,

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:50.530
so the idea of closing off the
town and building somewhere else,

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:53.730
is not a model to be
followed in this case.

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:57.660
And this is very reassuring to
me, so I hope that in a way,

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.690
the experience -- the
tragic experience

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:04.920
of the L'Aquila earthquake will
help the people in Amatrice

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.840
to rebuild faster and better homes.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:16.260
And incidentally, Amatrice was part
of L'Aquila territory until 1927.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.450
There is a very powerful link
between the two communities.

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:24.550
And in fact, I just read in the
paper today that several families

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:28.200
from Amatrice just arrived in
L'Aquila and will be housed

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:33.160
in the houses that were built
after the earthquake in L'Aquila.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.820
So there is a very strong link
between the two communities.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:41.120
&gt;&gt; What is the situation in
L'Aquila today, six years --

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.830
seven years after the earthquake?

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:50.560
&gt;&gt; Well, in the past two
years let's say, since 2014,

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.100
things have really changed.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:56.950
And the rebuilding of the town has
had a very powerful acceleration.

00:09:56.950 --> 00:10:00.050
So actually, I'm cautiously
optimistic about the --

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:01.470
-- of the town.

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:04.720
There are several question
marks, especially in terms

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.830
of what the population
is going to do,

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:10.240
because many people have
left L'Aquila, many people,

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:13.980
especially after what happened
in Amatrice, don't feel safe

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:21.950
in the center of town, so there are
still many issues to be discussed

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:24.070
and many problems to be solved.

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:25.450
But I'm cautiously optimistic.

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:29.580
&gt;&gt; I was talking to a friend
after the earthquake last week,

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:32.030
and what he said was that
in the United States,

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:35.390
we tend to think Italy for its
beauty and for its history,

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:40.450
and that what these earthquakes
have exposed is also its fragility.

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:44.220
And I wanted to ask you about the
title of your novel, as they said,

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.360
"Un paese di carta",
which relates to this,

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.810
what did you mean with your title?

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:54.590
&gt;&gt; First of all, thank
you, Lucia, and thank you,

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:56.330
Grant, and thank you, Emily.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:57.630
This is [inaudible].

00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:59.530
Thank you all for being here.

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:06.000 position:56%
But it's very interesting that Lucia
immediately brought up the issue

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.900 position:56%
of the title, because the title is
very hard to translate into English.

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.170
And it turned out to
be more ambiguous

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:15.920
than I thought even in Italian.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:20.120
In my mind -- in the
mind of the artist --

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:23.930
the title meant Italy
as a cultural --

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:26.220
and especially literary
construction --

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:33.400
as opposed to Italy as a
political and physical entity.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:38.930 position:56%
So in other words, one of the
protagonists of the novel is a woman

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:45.060
who left Italy at the end of the
50s and has the rest of her life

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:50.680 position:56%
in the United States, but has a kept
very strong relationship with Italy.

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:55.640
But Italy -- the Italy that she
loves is un paese di carta --

00:11:55.640 --> 00:12:01.360
it's a country made of paper in
the sense that it lives in books --

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.640
lives in its cultural artifacts.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:08.400
It's not Italy as a
political entity.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.270
There is only one passage
in the novel

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:19.140
where this expression is mentioned,
and it is precisely when Alice --

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.530
so the oldest of the three women --

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:25.460
the novel is about three
women, the oldest one is Alice.

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:30.380
And Alice is writing a letter to
her fiancé in Italy explaining

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:32.290
that she'll never go back.

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:36.320
And she says, "But
that does not matter

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:40.610
because I will always
inhabit the Italy I love --

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:43.790
a country made of paper."

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:47.150
But when I presented the
book, because I had the chance

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:51.170
to present the book all over
during the past year from Naples

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:53.180
to Venice and Turin, you know.

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:57.500
And when I presented it in
L'Aquila, especially I presented it

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:02.750
in several schools in L'Aquila,
and when I asked about the meaning

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:09.570
of the title, the answer I got
the most often was it's a fragile

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:14.460
country, it's a vulnerable
country, it's a country

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:18.540
that seems very solid, but
could collapse at any minute.

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:23.740
And I think there is really an
interference of the experience

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:29.890
of the earthquake which
taught us that -- fragility.

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:33.420
But it's very interesting
to me that now

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:38.660
for the first time yesterday
actually, when we posted something

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:44.290 position:56%
on Facebook, I also -- since this is
the first presentation of the novel

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:50.230
in English -- so I commented on
Emily's post and I said, "Yes,

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:52.350
this is the first presentation
in English which brings

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:55.810
up the issue how to
translate the title."

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:59.020
And actually, somebody
answered in private,

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:03.390
because we're mostly Italians
answer, and one of them said,

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:08.320
"You know, forget about un paese
di carta altogether and focus

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:12.310
on something like she's
back -- she's back home."

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:14.000
And so I was thinking
that going home,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.950
although it's completely different,
couldn't be a possible title.

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:23.620 position:56%
But anyway, the title is -- yeah,
it was central in my way of thinking

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:25.520
about the book when
I started writing it,

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.680
so it's a challenging title.

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:31.480
&gt;&gt; So you mentioned that the
book is about three women.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:36.300
So Alice is the oldest, then
Alice's daughter is Jane,

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:39.110
and Jane's daughter is Sarah.

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:41.120
So Sarah is Alice's granddaughter.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:46.320
And three generations of
women over more than 50 years

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:49.900
from World War II all the
way up until the aftermath

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:52.200
of the earthquake in L'Aquila.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.470
So the first character
we meet is Sarah.

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:56.040
Tell us about Sarah.

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.310
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's hard
to talk about Sarah

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:00.320 position:56%
without talking about the other two.

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:05.790
So the oldest one is the only
one who has a clear birthdate

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:10.140
and also a death date
in the novel, is Alice.

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:17.340
Alice was born in 1930 in L'Aquila
and dies in Bethesda in 2010.

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:23.360
She left Italy in 1957 and
she had a daughter, Jane.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:27.450 position:56%
Jane in turn had three children, but
especially had this one daughter,

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:32.170
Sarah, who is 18 when
the novel begins in 2010.

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:38.970
She's multilingual, very bright,
very sensitive, and little bit

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:41.420
of a mess when the novel begins.

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:46.690
So the novel, in a way, is
also the [inaudible] of Sarah,

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:48.650
so it's a novel of formation.

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:54.100
A young protagonist manages
to overcome the challenges

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.820
on her path and enter adulthood.

00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:00.730
To a certain extent, because
I'm a little skeptical

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:04.800
about drastic resolutions, but the
Sarah, at the end of the novel,

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:09.070
is much stronger than the
Sarah we meet at the beginning.

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:14.640
One more thing about Sarah, Sarah
was born when her mother, Jane,

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:20.060
thought she had enough of
raising children and was ready

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:23.560
to start her career as a lawyer.

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:30.580
So Jane even considered
having an abortion.

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:35.270
In the end, she did
have this child, Sarah,

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:40.380
but had been the grandmother,
Alice, to raise Sarah.

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:42.640
Which means that Sarah,
to her grandmother,

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.490
also lived in un paese di carta.

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:47.140
She had lived in this kind

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:52.800
of an abstract entity
that was Italy for her.

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:58.400
And when she finally goes to
Italy, she's faced with the reality

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:01.420
that is very different
from her expectations.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:05.170
&gt;&gt; And the reason that Sarah goes
to Italy is because Alice has died.

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:07.610
This happens relatively
early in the novel,

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:08.910
so we're not giving away too much.

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:10.210
&gt;&gt; It's not a spoiler.

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:11.510
Yeah.

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:12.810
[ Laughter ]

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:15.170
&gt;&gt; But Sarah volunteers to take
her grandmother's ashes back

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:18.610
to L'Aquila, which is
what Alice had requested.

00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:21.810
So tell us about Alice.

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:28.780
&gt;&gt; Yes. Alice -- I think one of
the things that I like the most

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:30.490
in the novel, or at
least one of the things

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:36.750
that I had the more fun writing,
is the scene of the will,

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:45.300 position:56%
when the family -- after a lively
Thanksgiving dinner, the family gets

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:51.070
to read Alice's last wishes,
and one of them is the fact

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:54.190
that she wants her
ashes to be scattered

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:56.430
in her hometown -- in L'Aquila.

00:17:56.430 --> 00:18:00.620
And nobody really wants to
do that, it's expensive,

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:03.940 position:56%
it's time-consuming and all of that.

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:08.060
And Sarah, who is only 18,
says, "Well, I'm going to do it.

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:12.430
I'll go." And so she goes
to L'Aquila, and of course,

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:18.420
she realizes that does not know
before going, but she realizes

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:21.850
as soon as she steps in L'Aquila
that she's in a disaster zone.

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:26.600
So in this way, Sarah's path
crosses the whole problematic

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:27.900
of the earthquake.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.910
&gt;&gt; And tell us more about Alice.

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:31.210
&gt;&gt; Alice.

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:32.510
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:34.690
&gt;&gt; Alice -- well, really, I
don't want to reveal too much.

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:38.890
Alice is a librarian, so it's
wonderful to talk about Alice here.

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:43.130
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I was going to
mention it, but I wanted you to.

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:45.250
[ Laughter ]

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:48.760
&gt;&gt; Alice is a librarian,
and since she's a librarian,

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:52.220
literature plays a really
big role in this book,

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:57.140
because she's a librarian and she
lived in a country made of paper.

00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:00.110
She's quite a rebellious character.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:05.470 position:56%
And in fact, we'll find out towards
the end of the novel that her choice

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:08.950
to leave Italy was really
a form of rebellion.

00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:15.330
She was born in 1930, so she had
lived the first part of her life

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:20.220
under fascism, and this is an
experience that deeply marked her

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.010
and her family in ways

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:24.400
that we discover towards
the end of the novel.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.590
So the novel is also --
there is also a little bit

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:28.810
of a mystery to be solved.

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:35.100
Why did Alice leave and why
did Alice leave in those terms,

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:37.920
you know, without ever going back.

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.980
This is something we find out.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:41.710
&gt;&gt; And I wanted to
ask, is it true --

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:44.630
or did you find it to be
true as many novelists say,

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:47.090
that your characters
reveal themselves

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:52.970
to you more than you creating them?

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:56.020
&gt;&gt; There is certainly some
truth in that, absolutely.

00:19:56.020 --> 00:20:00.070 position:56%
I mean, it is embarrassing, but I
found some notes about this novel --

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:02.960
-- from 1994.

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:06.030
Unfortunately, you know,
computer files are merciless.

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:09.610
I found some notes
form 1994, you know,

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:14.440
so it took me a long
time to write this novel.

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:21.320
And it is absolutely true that I
basically had one idea in mind,

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:24.460
the idea that I tried to
explain, the idea of Italy

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:26.830
as a cultural construction.

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:33.510
This is probably an
idea linked to my job --

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:36.640
to my work as a professor
at Georgetown --

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:40.570
I have the privilege really of
dealing with the best [inaudible]

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:44.270
as produced throughout
the centuries.

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:50.680
So I myself sometimes feel that I'm
living in a country made of paper.

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:53.790 position:56%
So I had this notion -- this idea --

00:20:53.790 --> 00:21:00.640
of the gap between Italy as a
cultural construct and Italy

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:03.220
as a political and physical entity.

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:07.830
And I had a scene, the first scene
of the novel, or the first scene

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:10.230
that I wrote in the novel.

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:13.650
And with this, too, I was
taking different paths

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:19.480 position:56%
and I was going nowhere until the
novel and the characters really took

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:25.740
that direction -- as I say, the
A24 Highway that leads from Rome

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:31.000
to L'Aquila, and the novel seemed
to take its direction really.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.980
And if I might add one more
thing, so I started also --

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:41.660
I realized when the novel
took me to L'Aquila,

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:45.250
that I could not find a
better metaphor for this idea

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:49.090
of a country made of paper,
then what happened to L'Aquila.

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:53.750
So the contrast between L'Aquila
with its past, its monument,

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:59.160
and L'Aquila as basically
an ugly suburb,

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:04.720
that's what it had been
turned into by the earthquake.

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:08.550
And if I do a little bit
of an auto self-analysis,

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:16.150 position:56%
I also wonder if this notion on "Un
paese di carta" was so present to me

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:19.810
at that point because I had
witnessed the destruction

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:25.110
of the earthquake, and therefore,
this idea of the contrast

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:32.810
between Italy one dreams of and
the real Italy was appearing

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:36.120
to me particularly poignant at
that point because of this --

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:37.590
because of the earthquake.

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:39.760
&gt;&gt; Right. And I think another
contrast in the book --

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:41.920
or maybe not contrast,
but juxtaposition --

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:45.800
is between the past and the
present, and you have this balance.

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:50.340
And I know you have a reading from
your book that you'd like to do

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:55.560
and it shows this balance
between the past and the present.

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:59.220
&gt;&gt; OK. I should warn
you that this is --

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:05.730
so I translated with Emily's
help, I translated a passage

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:11.170
from the book for this occasion.

00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:15.190
Actually, I adapted a
passage of the book.

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:24.750 position:56%
This is the central scene of the
book or the first scene in the book.

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:34.720 position:56%
It's the scene of Alice's death, and
it deals with the past and presence.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:38.350
So Alice is very ill at this point.

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:41.110
She's 80 years old
and she's very ill.

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:49.490
She has a caretaker who comes to
her place, but that particular day,

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:52.010
the caretaker is late because --

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:56.010
you are not going to believe that
there was a problem with Metro.

00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:57.310
[ Laughter ]

00:23:57.310 --> 00:24:00.060
So I know you're thinking now this
is science fiction, this cannot be,

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:02.340
but you know, I thought
it was plausible.

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:07.090
Even in 2010, I thought
it could happen someday.

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:09.050
So the caretaker is late.

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:15.360
Alice thinks this is her one chance
to have one last something --

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.330
she doesn't know exactly what.

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:21.890
But she leaves her house,
her home in Bethesda,

00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:24.350
and she gets on the
Capital Crescent Trail.

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:27.270
The Capital Crescent Trail
is this beautiful bike path

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:31.680
that from Bethesda takes you
all the way to Georgetown.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:35.150
So she starts walking
along the path.

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:36.750
The passage is a bit long,

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:39.700
so the bad news is the passage
is a bit long; the good news is

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:42.070
that it's the only passage
that I'm going to read.

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:43.870
So just bear with me.

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:48.040
[ Laughter ]

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:52.680
The Capital Crescent Trail, a bike
path built over an old railroad,

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:56.640
was crowded as usual
at that time of day.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.990
Dogs -- purebreds naturally --

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:04.030
trotted along, tethered by their
leashes to their proud owners.

00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:07.580
Young women unwilling to surrender
to motherhood chase the dream

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:12.890
of a perfect body, pushing their
babies in jogging strollers.

00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:15.970
Commuters sped by on
racing bicycles,

00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:19.620
sporting yellow windbreakers
and streamlined helmets.

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:23.140
The most determined among them
carried the large saddlebags packed

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:28.560 position:56%
with important documents, a change
of clothes, a couple of energy bars.

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.860
Now and then, they
glance at their watches

00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:34.210
to make sure they were
keeping up with themselves.

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:38.430
"On your left," they called out to
warn pedestrians of their passing,

00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:41.740
but they shouted without
animosity out of habit.

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:45.750
The most polite, [inaudible] time
to utter a distracted, "Thank you,"

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:48.840
as they rushed towards their
offices on Massachusetts Avenue

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:53.250 position:56%
in Georgetown, even on Capitol Hill.

00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:56.510
Alice was familiar enough with
the Capital Crescent Trail to know

00:25:56.510 --> 00:26:00.260
that it was rare to spot a couple
holding hands as if this place

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:02.810
of affection were a waste of time.

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:05.380
Everybody -- from the
moms to the commuters --

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:09.510
seemed to be on a mission to get in
shape, to make the fastest commute,

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:13.900
to reach the right level of
cholesterol and blood sugar.

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:17.770
Suddenly, Alice found something
obscene about thinking of disease

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:20.680
or death out for a walk, a bit

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:24.230
like that old movie,
"Death Takes a Holiday".

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:26.260
She wrapped herself
in an oversized jacked

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:29.270
and tried to look presentable.

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:33.550
"Watch out on your left,"
somebody shouted, startling her.

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:35.840
Perhaps without realizing
it, she had veered

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.420
into the center of the path.

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:40.990
She decided to leave the
pavement altogether and move

00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:44.150
to the gravel that ran next to it.

00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:45.800
Better. That was better.

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:50.650
She could walk at her own pace with
no fear of disrupting the traffic.

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:52.660
That way, she could
even try to go as far

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:55.740
as the Aqueduct Tunnel and beyond.

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:57.480
Whatever happened, she thought,

00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:02.150
the excursion was an expected
gift given the season.

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:04.440
The gravel was irregular, though.

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:08.070
Alice walked carefully, her
eyes fixed on the ground.

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:10.750
At first, she did not
notice the tall,

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:14.510
dark figure walking beside her.

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:25.030

"Sister [inaudible],"
Alice exclaimed.

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:31.660
The figure kept talking as
she walked, barely glancing

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:34.510
at the book at the hands.

"Sister [inaudible]," Alice called

with her threatening [inaudible]
Latin phrases that she recited

in such devout stubbornness
as if her salvation depended

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:58.430
on the perfect articulation.

00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:01.830
It occurred to Alice that if she
wanted to attract her attention,

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:03.670
she needed to try something
different,

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:06.020
perhaps to speak the same language.

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.510

Alice tried to keep up,
but soon fell behind.

to shake off her weakness.

scattered to the wind.

Words scattered to the wind.

Wasn't that a line from a poem?

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:06.660
"Yes, but not one of my poems,"
said an animated voice at her side.

All of a sudden he
seemed uncomfortable.

He loosened the scarf around
his neck, opened his jacket,

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:15.520
and took out a big stack of papers
held together by a purple ribbon.

He put the packet in Alice's hands
and ran away light on his feet.

She tried to chase him,
but quickly fell behind.

Perhaps he was right.

She couldn't even take
care of his papers.

One after the other, they
escaped from the ribbon

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:45.790
and flew along the path
like fallen leaves.

Had autumn come so soon?

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:54.640 position:56%
The pointless chase had taken Alice
close to the entrance of the tunnel.

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:58.880
The traffic of pedestrians and
occasional cyclists had fanned out

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:02.900
and the path was empty except
for a few later commuter bikers.

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:06.220
To enter the tunnel, Alice would
have to abandon the gravel and walk

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:08.230
on the pavement in the dark.

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:11.110
She wished that she had
brought a flashlight.

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:12.740
Perhaps if she hurried, though,

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:15.730
no cyclist would enter the
tunnel at the same time.

00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:18.930
She took a deep breath before
diving into the darkness.

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:22.250
She knew she could not rely on
her eyes and that the only way

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:25.520
to stay straight was to
use the wall as a handrail.

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:29.820
She stretched out her fingers
to brush the side of the tunnel,

00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:33.540
felt the dirt and humidity under
her nails, focused on her breathing

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:36.870
and kept walking toward the line.

00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:40.900
A familiar presence sent
shivers down her spine.

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:44.330
It was Eric with his stone
jeans and his indigo T-shirt,

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:46.230
smiling his ironic smile.

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:49.670
His [inaudible] head
leaning slightly to one side.

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:53.270
His [inaudible] was out,
he was asking for a ride.

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:55.090
How could Alice say no?

00:31:55.090 --> 00:31:57.180
She slows down.

00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:59.580
Eric's smile is now victorious.

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:02.100
He turns around and
heads towards the river

00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:04.890
as if he has forgotten about Alice.

00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:08.330
But she's tired of illusive
encounters and [inaudible] ghosts,

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:11.550
and without a second thought,
she runs around after him.

00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:15.540
The ground around the path is not
landscaped, it is slippery, ragged,

00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:18.700
full of creepers, [inaudible],
fallen trees.

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:23.120
Alice loses her slippers, her
flannel pajamas are torn and muddy.

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:26.530
She scrapes her hands as she
reaches out for branches, bushes,

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:30.250
anything that might slow her
descent toward the river.

00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:31.790
When she finally stops on the banks

00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:33.590
of the Potomac, Eric
has disappeared.

00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:39.630
She tries to catch her
breath as she looks around.

00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:43.070
The Potomac is still
recovering from a rainy season.

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:45.870
For weeks, its impetuous
currents have carried

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:50.250
and deposited the debris left
behind by the summer storms.

00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:53.770
Finally, in this mild beginning
of fall, the river is returning

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:56.700
to its normal majestic course.

00:32:56.700 --> 00:33:00.830
Alice is mesmerized by the
gaze of the sun on the water.

00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:03.230
"Hi, there."

00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:06.850
Unlike Alice, Eric does
not look tired at all.

00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:11.090
He smiles at her as he sits on the
grass with his usual casual air.

00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:13.260
The expression of a
man who is not yet home

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:16.610 position:56%
and is already planning his journey.

00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:19.650
"Long time no see," he
approaches her with a smile.

00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:22.840
"I was beginning to think
you'd never make it."

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:24.400
She moves closer.

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:27.060
"I'm sorry I'm late," she
thinks of telling him.

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:28.410
"I got distracted.

00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:31.500
Half a century goes by
in the blink of an eye."

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.990
"Why don't you sit down?"

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:38.070
Alice bends over with great caution
as they taught her at the clinic,

00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:40.660
first one knee, then the other.

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:44.540
The slipping ground is tricky
and she ends up flat on her back.

00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:46.820
She finds that she's
not uncomfortable,

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:49.410
but will she get back on her feet?

00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:51.900
"They were all wrong, all of them.

You were great.

"She's fine.

Very well actually.

She's so beautiful -- our Jane
-- so confident, so grown up.

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:04.300
We are grandparents, you know.

We have three grandchildren, and the
eldest granddaughter is pregnant.

We'll be great-grandparents soon."

00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:15.430
She would like to tell him all
of that, but she hesitates.

00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:18.770
How can one tell such
things to a man in his 20s?

00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:21.980
She would not want to upset him.

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:24.060
Eric lies down next to her.

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:27.720
With his fingers, he
caresses the grass.

00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:31.180
Alice is beaming with light
and trembling with fear.

00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:34.530
Now he will realize
I'm old, she thinks.

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:37.410
She's suddenly concerned
about her looks, her age,

00:34:37.410 --> 00:34:39.190
the state of her pajamas.

00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:41.660
She leans on her elbow
and lies on one side,

00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:44.340
surreptitiously checking her pants.

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:47.030
She cannot believe what she sees.

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:50.620
Her legs emerge from under a
miniskirt and they are firm

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:54.510
and tanned -- the legs of a person
who has never foot in a gym,

00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:58.550
but has walked all over out
of desire and curiosity.

00:34:58.550 --> 00:35:02.130
She has not seen those legs in
a while, and bends her knee just

00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:06.710
to watch the muscle flex
under the tight, smooth skin.

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:09.090
When she overcomes her surprise,

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:12.620
she realizes that Eric
has gotten very close --

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:16.640
so close, he's practically
leaning on her.

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:20.610
Alice recognizes that unforgettable
smell of wet underbrush

00:35:20.610 --> 00:35:25.290
and saltiness, and follows his
lips as they move towards hers

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:30.190
until they are so close
they become blurry.

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:35.970
Kissing her with my soul upon my
lips, it suddenly took flight.

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:40.270 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Tell us how you wrote that scene.

00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:42.070
Oh, yeah.

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:46.050
[ Applause ]

00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:51.940
&gt;&gt; I think this scene could be a
little confusing because it's --

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:58.210
especially for those who haven't
read the first 50 pages leading

00:35:58.210 --> 00:36:00.000
to that scene.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.020
Basically, Alice sees
the ghosts of the people

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:08.110
who were very dear to
her during her life.

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:16.280
So first, there is a nun -- she
studied with the nuns in L'Aquila.

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:20.800
Then there is her brother
who was a partisan.

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:27.360
And then there is Eric,
the man she loved

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:32.410 position:56%
and whom she followed to the states.

00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:39.940
The scene -- as you know, Emily
-- I mean, I was merciful,

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:43.350
the scene is much longer
in the original

00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:49.960
because she meets other
people, she sees other people.

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:56.590
As I mentioned, I had one notion --
one concept -- the paese di carta,

00:36:56.590 --> 00:36:57.890
the country made of paper --

00:36:57.890 --> 00:37:00.790
and I had one scene in mind,
and this was the scene.

00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:08.440
And probably in a way, this did
have an autobiographical origin

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:12.590
because I bike the Capital
Crescent Trail almost every day

00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:13.890
to go to work.

00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:18.200
I think I bike the trail
in every possible weather.

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:23.080
And there was a particular
day where it was very foggy,

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:30.260
and the few people I managed
to pass and the many people

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:33.380
who were passing me,
really looked like ghosts.

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:37.590
I could see them for a few
seconds and then they disappeared,

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:40.180
you know, swallowed by the fog.

00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:46.290
So perhaps that's how
I got the inspiration.

00:37:46.290 --> 00:37:48.700
It's wonderful to bike the trail,

00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:55.000
but when you do it several times
a day, you know, twice a day

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.770
or several times a week for several
years, it does get a bit boring.

00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:00.070
So I think it's [inaudible].

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:04.620
&gt;&gt; But now you can think of
Alice, so it's not boring at all.

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:06.040
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:10.520
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So Alice dies there on the
trail, but she does leave the book.

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:11.820
&gt;&gt; No.

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:14.900
&gt;&gt; She remains a presence in the
novel even after she has died.

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:17.610
Tell us about that and
what that was like.

00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:24.380
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Perhaps I've gotten
very close to Alice even

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:27.750
in her short life in the book.

00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:32.050
So I just couldn't bear
myself to let her go.

00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:35.730
So after her death,
she's still a presence.

00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:41.550
In fact, there is one of the
chapters that is titled "After".

00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:43.630
And much to her surprise,

00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:52.380 position:56%
she discovers that although she has
died, she can still follow the lives

00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:54.460
of the people around her.

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:59.290
So in that little urn with her
name, she's still something.

00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:03.340
And so she keeps being
a presence a book,

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:08.230
and it is a very important
presence for me

00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:14.400
because Alice has a very ironic
voice, and throughout the book,

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:18.730
she develops this kind of
sarcastic even at times --

00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:25.430
ironic counterpoint to the events
in the lives of people around her.

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:31.050
So for instance, again, the scene
of the will, she's actually present

00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:35.370
because all of the family is
there when the will is opened.

00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:40.330
She can really judge the
reaction of the people around.

00:39:40.330 --> 00:39:42.210
&gt;&gt; And she's present
because her ashes are

00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:44.280
in the urn that is on the mantel --

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:45.580
&gt;&gt; On the mantel.

00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:46.880
Absolutely.

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:48.180
&gt;&gt; -- in the room where
the will is being read.

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:49.480
&gt;&gt; On the mantel.

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:50.780
And she has also a hard
time adjusting to the mantel

00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:54.060
because her daughter, Jane, has
accumulated also some rubbish.

00:39:54.060 --> 00:40:00.040
You know, our homes tend to
be overcrowded with things.

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:03.190
And this mantelpiece in
particular has the hourglass,

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:08.960
the fake Murano glass,
all of this kind of junk.

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:15.690
And Alice has problems trying
to affirm her difference

00:40:15.690 --> 00:40:19.580
from this other junk that
populates the mantelpiece.

00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:20.880
So yeah.

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:27.240
&gt;&gt; I want to ask a question about
one of the parts of your reading.

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:32.160
So you referred to Alberto who is
Alice's brother, and the Germans,

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:35.990
and he's going off
with a hunting rifle.

00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:37.790
This refers to the war, of course.

00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:43.070
What was happening in L'Aquila
during the war at this time,

00:40:43.070 --> 00:40:47.740
just give some background.

00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:50.190
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well L'Aquila -- I mean,

00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:53.390
I don't want to give a
little history class, sorry.

00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:56.890
But just very briefly
to introduce Alberto.

00:40:56.890 --> 00:41:04.270
L'Aquila all of a sudden found
itself at the center of action

00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:08.320
in a way because now talking 1943.

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:17.650
Mussolini had resigned on July 25,
1943, and had been made prisoner.

00:41:17.650 --> 00:41:21.840
So he had been put in a prison
nearly L'Aquila in the mountains,

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:25.030
in the Apennines on the Gran Sasso.

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:29.830
Then September 8th, Italy signs
the armistice with the allies.

00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:34.180
September 12th, the
Germans free Mussolini

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:38.170
from his prison in the Apennines.

00:41:38.170 --> 00:41:41.720
So the events were really
going very, very fast.

00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:43.800
Everybody was very confused.

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:49.380 position:56%
The king had flown to the south, the
allies were coming from the south.

00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:53.480
All of a sudden, L'Aquila
was packed with Germans.

00:41:53.480 --> 00:42:00.310 position:56%
And there had been this announcement
that all young men between age 18

00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:04.570
and 25 had to be registered.

00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:08.560
So people were afraid of
that to mean, you know,

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:11.780
that could mean a deportation,
that could mean being forced

00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:17.430
to fight alongside with the
Germans and so on and so forth.

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:21.330
So in this very confusing
atmosphere, there were a group

00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:28.110
of young people from L'Aquila who
on September 22nd left the town

00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:34.660
and went to the mountains probably
to start a partisan brigade

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:41.220
or to reach other groups of
partisans in the mountains.

00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:43.340
They were immediately captured.

00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:44.720
They were captured the day after.

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:47.320
They were brought back to town,

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:51.860
and nine of them were
killed -- were executed.

00:42:51.860 --> 00:43:00.810 position:56%
So this was perhaps one of the first
episodes of resistance in Italy

00:43:00.810 --> 00:43:05.750
because again, you know, the
armistice was on September 8th,

00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:10.400
they were killed on September 23rd.

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:15.390
There is a lot of mystery
surrounding this episode

00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:20.940 position:56%
because the news of that was kept as
a secret until the end of the war,

00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:27.510
until L'Aquila was liberated,
which happened on June 13, 1944,

00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:31.320
so almost ten months later.

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:34.350 position:56%
And it is still a mystery because --

00:43:34.350 --> 00:43:36.670
and I did not know this
when I wrote the book,

00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:41.060
I found out about this later --

00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:45.580
there was a trial after
the war in 1947,

00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:48.530
there was a trial about
this episode.

00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:53.980
But the proceedings of the trial
are kept secret for 70 years.

00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:58.530
So the trial was in 1947,
now next year in 2017,

00:43:58.530 --> 00:44:03.450
we'll finally know what was
established during that trial.

00:44:03.450 --> 00:44:06.650
Italy does not have the [inaudible]
of Freedom of Information Act.

00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:11.190
So they have this --
the judge can say --

00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:17.720
can establish that the
proceedings can be kept secret

00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:19.930
and cannot divulged to the public.

00:44:19.930 --> 00:44:24.390
I know that a journalist
tried to have access --

00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:28.680
petition to have access to the
proceedings, and he was unable to.

00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:31.370
I know of this case because the
journalist published an article

00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:32.670
about this.

00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:34.590
I don't know how many other
people tried to find out more

00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:41.140
about the trial and they were
prohibited from doing so.

00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:51.480
The link with the novel is that
I imagine that Alberto was one

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:57.870
of the nine martyrs -- as they are
called in Italian, [inaudible] --

00:44:57.870 --> 00:45:01.870 position:56%
who was killed in this circumstance.

00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:06.550
So it's an imaginary character,
but he combines the characteristics

00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:13.840
of some of these nine heroes.

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:20.190
Young age -- Alberto is only
17, and love for poetry.

00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:24.880
One of the nine had already
published a book of poetry.

00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:29.550
The youngest was 17 and the
oldest was 21 years old.

00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:39.630
So in this way, the story of
Alice and Sarah intersects

00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:44.400
with the history of the town.

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:47.510
&gt;&gt; And although we don't
know for sure what happens,

00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:50.410
I've gathered from you that
one of the suggestions is

00:45:50.410 --> 00:45:55.070
that perhaps these
young men were betrayed.

00:45:55.070 --> 00:46:02.370
&gt;&gt; Yeah. There are several
issues that are not clear.

00:46:02.370 --> 00:46:04.960
Why were they captured so soon?

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:10.290
Why was the news over
there kept as a secret?

00:46:10.290 --> 00:46:15.410
So there are many things
that are not clear.

00:46:15.410 --> 00:46:18.470
And [inaudible] Cavalieri [assumed
spelling], a historian who wrote

00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:23.660
about this, says that they were
captured and killed and not only

00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:27.210
by the Germans, but also
by Italian fascists.

00:46:27.210 --> 00:46:31.180
But if we are talking about
Italian fascists in a small town,

00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:36.190
we are talking about the neighbor,
the cousin, you know, relatives.

00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:41.210
So it's really a burning issue.

00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:45.890
So there I had some room
to maneuver, you know,

00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:50.350
I could use what [inaudible]
calls the license to invent,

00:46:50.350 --> 00:46:56.500
and I could offer a hypothesis

00:46:56.500 --> 00:47:01.660
about the reason why they
were captured so soon.

00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:06.130
So in the book, there is a
totally fictional hypothesis,

00:47:06.130 --> 00:47:11.110
but that is coherent with
the historical framework.

00:47:11.110 --> 00:47:14.980 position:56%
And I don't know if I'm being clear.

00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:16.280
But yeah.

00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:17.580
&gt;&gt; And so earlier you
talked about --

00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:18.880
&gt;&gt; Please explain this for me.

00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:20.400
I'm not being very clear.

00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:21.700
Help. Help.

00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:23.000
&gt;&gt; No, she was clear.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:24.300
&gt;&gt; Perfectly clear.

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:26.520
&gt;&gt; So going back to the
point about how Alice --

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:30.900
even after her death when
she's now cremated ashes --

00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:32.730
she's still aware of
what's happening,

00:47:32.730 --> 00:47:35.150
and she comments on what she sees.

00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:40.320 position:56%
Well, when Sarah, her granddaughter,
her takes the ashes back to L'Aquila

00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:45.160
as Alice had wished, she
sees the state of the city.

00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:48.330
So the late Alice makes
this observation

00:47:48.330 --> 00:47:54.120
that even the war hadn't
hit L'Aquila

00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:55.760
in the way that the earthquake did.

00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:58.000
And maybe that's obvious,
but this really struck me

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.360
because you think World
War II being so monumental

00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:05.430
and so catastrophic
in every possible way.

00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:09.040
And here in the span of a couple
of seconds with the earthquake,

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:12.590
what Alice is sees is this
has hurt L'Aquila more.

00:48:12.590 --> 00:48:15.960
I wanted to ask you
to elaborate on that.

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:19.330
Did you have that sense when
you went back to L'Aquila

00:48:19.330 --> 00:48:23.720
after the earthquake and saw it,
or do you think this is true?

00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:25.810
&gt;&gt; Well, it certainly
-- in the case L'Aquila,

00:48:25.810 --> 00:48:30.030 position:56%
it is true because there was an area

00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:33.560
in L'Aquila near the train
station that was bombed.

00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:42.900
But apart from that, the city was
largely spared by World War II.

00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:47.370
So definitely the devastation
in L'Aquila has always happened

00:48:47.370 --> 00:48:51.960
because of the earthquakes,
historical from --

00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:57.960
L'Aquila has had earthquakes
throughout its history.

00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:04.050
So yes, absolutely, it is true.

00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:11.120
What has changed in the reaction
to the earthquakes, though,

00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:13.030
is very interesting I think.

00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:15.300
There is a passage in the novel.

00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:20.960
So Sarah goes to L'Aquila and finds
that she's in a disastrous zone

00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:22.760
and she was not prepared to that.

00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:30.420
And she meets a young man from
L'Aquila who is very active

00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:35.850
in trying to promote a
responsible rebuilding process.

00:49:35.850 --> 00:49:41.670
And this young man at some point
explains to Sarah a little bit

00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:44.690
of the history of the city.

00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:49.800
And he says that L'Aquila has
always suffered from earthquakes.

00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:54.120
And there was in particular,
a very strong earthquake less

00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:57.160
than a century after
the town was built.

00:49:57.160 --> 00:50:00.300
But in that case, the lord
of the town immediately --

00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:06.360
-- sent out soldiers to all the
gates to prevent the population

00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:12.140
from leaving the city because
the town was a recent town,

00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:14.360
and actually the people --

00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:20.490
the citizens of the town came from
various villages around the town,

00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:22.880
so they were ready to go back.

00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:25.980
And the lord of the
town said, "No way.

00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:29.520
You will stay here
and you'll rebuild."

00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:32.320
And now this young
man, Alesandro, says,

00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:34.940
"Now this time, the
opposite happened.

00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:37.210
This time the government
has intervened

00:50:37.210 --> 00:50:43.570
to lock the town off
from the citizens.

00:50:43.570 --> 00:50:48.580 position:56%
So in other words, the entire town
has been declared as a disaster zone

00:50:48.580 --> 00:50:54.320
and people are being forced to move
away, to go away from the town."

00:50:54.320 --> 00:51:00.590
So the [inaudible] a centripetal
force, we have a centripetal force.

00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:06.300
And I think that's an
interesting theme in the book.

00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:10.920
The book is also a snapshot
of the situation in L'Aquila

00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:15.060
at a particular point of
the rebuilding process

00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:21.090
in the years 2010, 2011
when nothing was happening.

00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:26.520
And it was only the activity,
the rebellion of the people

00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:31.320
from L'Aquila that allowed the
rebuilding process to start.

00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:37.530
I imagined Alesandro -- though
it's not mentioned in the book --

00:51:37.530 --> 00:51:41.960
but I imagine Alesandro like one
of the people of the wheel barrels.

00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:44.700
I wrote an article in
the "Post" about that.

00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:51.450
So the people who after a year of
inactivity forced their entrance

00:51:51.450 --> 00:51:54.860
into the center of
town only to discover

00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:58.120
that nothing was being done,
that there was still rubble

00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:00.190
and nothing was happening.

00:52:00.190 --> 00:52:06.000
So I think probably I went
far away from the question.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.300
&gt;&gt; That's OK.

00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:08.600
She mentioned the "Post" --

00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:09.900
&gt;&gt; But you have been my student,

00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:11.200
so you are not surprised
by this kind of -- no?

00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:12.500
[ Laughter ]

00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:13.800
&gt;&gt; I want to add something.

00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:17.280
She mentioned -- it is true,
I remember when this happened.

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:20.500
She wrote an article for the
"Post" when the earthquake happened

00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:23.830
in L'Aquila and then one year
after on the anniversary.

00:52:23.830 --> 00:52:27.050
And I went back and read them,
these two articles, before today

00:52:27.050 --> 00:52:29.570
and they're -- of course,
it's non-fiction,

00:52:29.570 --> 00:52:31.330
they're essays of commentaries.

00:52:31.330 --> 00:52:34.050
But you can look them
up, they'll be online.

00:52:34.050 --> 00:52:36.830
And many of the ideas
that Laura wrote

00:52:36.830 --> 00:52:41.720
about in those articles surfaced
in various ways in the novel.

00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:43.820
So if you're interested,
they're there.

00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:49.160
I wanted to say, in many ways,
the book is about grief and loss.

00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:55.140
You have Alice who loses the way of
life as she knew it after the war.

00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:58.630
You have Sarah who loses her
grandmother when she dies.

00:52:58.630 --> 00:53:02.830
You have the people of L'Aquila who
lose their town in the earthquake.

00:53:02.830 --> 00:53:06.450
But in spite of all of that, it
feels to me like a hopeful book.

00:53:06.450 --> 00:53:09.980
And I wonder if you
agree, and if you do, why?

00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:11.490
&gt;&gt; No, I agree.

00:53:11.490 --> 00:53:14.930
In fact, I'm always afraid of
this when I talk about the book.

00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:19.090
I'm always afraid that
the book sounds more --

00:53:19.090 --> 00:53:21.640
it sounds a bit depressing.

00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:22.940
But [inaudible] --

00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:24.240
&gt;&gt; It's not.

00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:25.540
&gt;&gt; It's not.

00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:29.870
Because in the end, sure, there
is grief and there is loss,

00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:36.810
but in the end, communication
wins over silence.

00:53:36.810 --> 00:53:38.110
The memory is preserved.

00:53:38.110 --> 00:53:44.350
So in the end, I think that there
are human forces that manage

00:53:44.350 --> 00:53:48.280
to overcome the obstacles.

00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:52.030
In particular, I'm thinking, so
Sarah has to fulfill this mission

00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:55.440
as to scatter her grandmother's
ashes in L'Aquila.

00:53:55.440 --> 00:54:01.530 position:56%
But really, her real mission is to
understand her grandmother's history

00:54:01.530 --> 00:54:05.170
to establish that continuity
between past and present.

00:54:05.170 --> 00:54:09.810
And it is at that point that
Alice can really die, you know,

00:54:09.810 --> 00:54:13.390
because she had accomplished
her mission.

00:54:13.390 --> 00:54:17.830
So I think there is after all,
a positive tone in the book,

00:54:17.830 --> 00:54:21.420
an upbeat tone in the
book after all.

00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:22.720
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:25.440
&gt;&gt; And there are many passages
that I had a lot of fun writing,

00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:29.930
and I hope the readers
have some fun reading.

00:54:29.930 --> 00:54:33.640
&gt;&gt; And what you said
about Sarah learning more

00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:36.850
about her grandmother's life and
finally understanding why it was

00:54:36.850 --> 00:54:38.610 position:56%
that she had left Italy, it reminded

00:54:38.610 --> 00:54:41.230
of a conversation we
had a long time ago

00:54:41.230 --> 00:54:43.990
and we were talking
about the war in Italy.

00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:45.780
And you said that there was --

00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:50.260
you made this observation that so
much gets lost between generations,

00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:52.680
and in particular, between
parents and children.

00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:53.980
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:54:53.980 --> 00:54:55.280
&gt;&gt; And that's what you said.

00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:57.180
And here, you have a granddaughter

00:54:57.180 --> 00:55:01.270
who has this very profound
relationship with her grandmother.

00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:05.560 position:56%
And I wondered if when you writing
the novel, you thought about this --

00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:08.030
everything that does get
lost between generations.

00:55:08.030 --> 00:55:09.330
&gt;&gt; Oh, yes, absolutely.

00:55:09.330 --> 00:55:11.420
&gt;&gt; Or that can be recuperated
as Sarah did.

00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:14.570
&gt;&gt; Yeah. No, no, absolutely.

00:55:14.570 --> 00:55:17.650
Yes, there is a lot, absolutely.

00:55:17.650 --> 00:55:20.330
I mean, you probably --
with your work about victims

00:55:20.330 --> 00:55:24.540
of the Holocaust -- you also
found this, that sometimes people

00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:28.020
who have gone through a traumatic
experience don't necessarily want

00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:29.600
to talk about that.

00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:32.110
Or they talk about that in ways

00:55:32.110 --> 00:55:37.340
that younger generations
are not ready to hear.

00:55:37.340 --> 00:55:40.610
I'm thinking of that
beautiful short story

00:55:40.610 --> 00:55:46.810
by Giorgio Bassani
about that, [inaudible].

00:55:46.810 --> 00:55:51.090
But anyway -- so there
is a lot that gets lost,

00:55:51.090 --> 00:55:54.730
but there are also ways
to recuperate that.

00:55:54.730 --> 00:56:01.720 position:56%
I think that sometimes, particularly
in this geneaology, granddaughter,

00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:08.850
mother -- I never know how to
say -- basically the daughter,

00:56:08.850 --> 00:56:14.390
so in this case, Jane,
sometimes it's the weak link.

00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:18.600 position:56%
Sometimes I find that even sometimes
with students, sometimes --

00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:26.410
well, if I can give you yet
another pointless anecdote --

00:56:26.410 --> 00:56:30.440
I will tell you that for instance,

00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:37.480
at Georgetown at graduation a few
years ago, there was a young woman,

00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:44.440 position:56%
a student, an Italian major who came
with her mother and her grandmother.

00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:47.660
And the mother could
not speak any Italian

00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:49.730
and the grandmother was from Italy.

00:56:49.730 --> 00:56:56.040
So basically, really the
younger person had managed

00:56:56.040 --> 00:57:02.140
to recuperate the heritage
of the older generation.

00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:05.710
This is something that we see
fairly, fairly often I'd say.

00:57:05.710 --> 00:57:09.000
So perhaps there was a
little bit about that.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:10.790
&gt;&gt; So I want to come back to Alice.

00:57:10.790 --> 00:57:12.570
Why did you make her a librarian?

00:57:12.570 --> 00:57:14.040
We're asking this [inaudible]
at the library.

00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:16.070
[ Laughter ]

00:57:16.070 --> 00:57:18.510
&gt;&gt; Yes, I would like to know.

00:57:18.510 --> 00:57:20.790
&gt;&gt; Well, I was thinking
-- it just came that way.

00:57:20.790 --> 00:57:22.090
I don't know.

00:57:22.090 --> 00:57:24.660
I was thinking a person
who loved literature.

00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:26.490
At the beginning when
she moves to the states,

00:57:26.490 --> 00:57:30.490
she has to do other jobs, she
works in stores, et cetera.

00:57:30.490 --> 00:57:35.630
But at some point, triumphantly,
she writes this letter saying

00:57:35.630 --> 00:57:41.140 position:56%
that I'm finally a librarian and I'm
even organizing language classes.

00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:42.440
I don't know.

00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:46.710
Perhaps it was in keeping with
the idea of "Un paese di carta".

00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:50.730
She's a librarian with
a passion for languages

00:57:50.730 --> 00:57:52.710
and for literature of course.

00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:56.620
&gt;&gt; And in particular -- so
Alice loves Italian literature,

00:57:56.620 --> 00:57:59.120
she loves Russian literature,
Russian poetry.

00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:03.040
These, by the way, are all
characteristics of Laura.

00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:05.060
[ Laughter ]

00:58:05.060 --> 00:58:08.210
So I'm going to tell -- it's
not a pointless anecdote,

00:58:08.210 --> 00:58:09.610
there is a point.

00:58:09.610 --> 00:58:11.130
There are no pointless anecdotes.

00:58:11.130 --> 00:58:14.570
So I took a number of classes that
Laura taught at Georgetown and one

00:58:14.570 --> 00:58:17.300
of them was a course on
contemporary Italian poetry.

00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:18.820
And it was so great.

00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:22.000
It was great because every
day we would go to class

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.590
and she would read the poems.

00:58:24.590 --> 00:58:27.660
And it was fantastic to listen
to listen to her read them

00:58:27.660 --> 00:58:29.680
and I looked forward
to it every week.

00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:33.040
So then at a certain point,
Laura decides that it's time

00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:36.240
for the students to learn to
recite these poems in Italian.

00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:39.660
And all of the fun went away
because we weren't good at it.

00:58:39.660 --> 00:58:41.490
I mean, there were no
Italians in the class,

00:58:41.490 --> 00:58:42.920
we didn't speak Italian that well.

00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:45.140
It was horrible to
listen to these poems.

00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:47.270
[ Laughter ]

00:58:47.270 --> 00:58:48.700
And so the class just
wasn't that much fun

00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:50.950
after Laura stopped
reading the poems.

00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:54.120
So since everyone is here, even
if you don't speak Italian,

00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:55.920
I assume that you're
interested in Italian

00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:57.260
because you're at this event.

00:58:57.260 --> 00:59:00.320
And so I'm taking advantage
and I'm going

00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:03.660
to ask Laura to read a poem here.

00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:07.520
And this poem figures --
it's a very short passage --

00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:08.990
it figures in the book.

00:59:08.990 --> 00:59:12.720 position:56%
So could you first -- you don't have
to translate it, but explain to us

00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:14.760
who wrote this and what it's about.

00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:17.460
And then would you read this to us?

00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:19.300
&gt;&gt; We haven't prepared this.

00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:20.600
[Inaudible].

00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:27.520
So it's a passage in the
book, and at some point Sarah

00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:30.560
in L'Aquila meets her grandmother,

00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:39.170
so Alice's fiancé whom Alice had
left when she move to the states.

00:59:39.170 --> 00:59:43.590
And the fiancé is also linked with
the other story about the war.

00:59:43.590 --> 00:59:47.350
But anyway, the fiancé is of
course also a passionate reader

00:59:47.350 --> 00:59:48.650
of literature.

00:59:48.650 --> 00:59:54.220
And the way Sarah manages
to take the secrets

00:59:54.220 --> 01:00:00.840
out of this old man
is by reciting poems.

01:00:03.570 --> 01:00:06.770
So she recites some Russian poetry.

01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:11.070
And then really the breaking
point when she recites --

01:00:11.070 --> 01:00:15.960
because I mentioned that Sarah
has an extraordinary memory --

01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:21.190
and so she recites this
passage from [inaudible]

01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:33.980
where in the very final battle,
Solomon, one of the characters,

01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:36.510
climbs a tower, and from the tower,

01:00:36.510 --> 01:00:42.220
he looks at what [inaudible] calls
the Great Theater of Human Life,

01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:46.900
the Great Place of
Chance and Destiny.

01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:49.790
And this is really the breaking
point because this old man,

01:00:49.790 --> 01:00:53.500
like all of us, perhaps the
more we age, the more we wonder

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:56.090
about these things
-- really wonders.

01:00:56.090 --> 01:00:57.970
So was it chance?

01:00:57.970 --> 01:00:59.270
Was it destiny?

01:00:59.270 --> 01:01:02.080
Why did things happen in
the way they happened?

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:05.360
Could things go any differently?

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:07.660
And this is the passage.

01:01:09.510 --> 01:01:32.070
[ Speaking Foreign Language ]

01:01:32.070 --> 01:01:34.310
&gt;&gt; So see why we missed
that when she stopped?

01:01:34.310 --> 01:01:36.600
[ Laughter ]

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:38.060
&gt;&gt; Do you have a translation
for that?

01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:39.360
No?

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:41.040
&gt;&gt; No.

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:42.340
&gt;&gt; You can go home and look it up.

01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:43.730
&gt;&gt; Louise, can you
improvise a translation.

01:01:43.730 --> 01:01:45.980
We have a wonderful translator
here, Louise [inaudible],

01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:47.570
but she's not working today.

01:01:47.570 --> 01:01:48.870
&gt;&gt; No.

01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:50.170
[ Laughter ]

01:01:50.170 --> 01:01:54.040
&gt;&gt; But anyway, that's the
-- yeah, it's really --

01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:57.700
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] you got
the context [inaudible].

01:01:57.700 --> 01:01:59.500
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:00.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:03.260
&gt;&gt; So we wanted to save
plenty of time for questions.

01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:09.330 position:56%
So please, I know Laura is happy to
answer any questions you might have.

01:02:09.330 --> 01:02:11.700
Don't be bashful.

01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:14.650
&gt;&gt; So please explain -- this
is all very interesting --

01:02:14.650 --> 01:02:20.890
please explain where your
early life in Italy --

01:02:20.890 --> 01:02:25.950
where you grew up and
how you decided to write

01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:29.400
about this particular area --

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:33.660
section of Italy in the
hills -- the Apennines.

01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:37.580
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I am from
L'Aquila, I grew up there,

01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:39.020
I went to high school there.

01:02:39.020 --> 01:02:41.830
Then I started in Rome,
and then from Rome,

01:02:41.830 --> 01:02:47.250
I went first to Canada then
came to the US to study.

01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:56.950
Then I lived in Paris for a while,
then I came back to the US to work.

01:02:56.950 --> 01:03:00.860
I think is actually my
personal limitation that I have.

01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:04.090
It is impossible for me
to write about places

01:03:04.090 --> 01:03:06.660
that I don't know personally.

01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:09.770
I mean, recently, I
was trying to write --

01:03:09.770 --> 01:03:12.690 position:56%
I was writing something and I wanted

01:03:12.690 --> 01:03:17.970
to just have a small scene
in a small Italian town.

01:03:17.970 --> 01:03:21.480
So in order not to have
everything happen in L'Aquila

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:24.740
because L'Aquila is a small
town, it seems kind of absurd

01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:27.650
that everything happens there,
I was thinking of [inaudible],

01:03:27.650 --> 01:03:31.640
I thought comparable town, almost
the same size, provincial town.

01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:37.390 position:56%
I wasn't able to have characters
have a cup of coffee in [inaudible],

01:03:37.390 --> 01:03:39.830
you know, take a bath
in [inaudible],

01:03:39.830 --> 01:03:43.010
as if they were on the moon.

01:03:43.010 --> 01:03:44.590
I could not picture anything.

01:03:44.590 --> 01:03:48.500
So in a way, the novel is
obviously not autobiographical,

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:52.400
but it's geographically
autobiographical.

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:57.050
I talk of places that, you
know, I lived in Bethesda.

01:03:57.050 --> 01:03:59.220
I know L'Aquila fairly well.

01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:03.920
And even there is also another
trip to the western United States,

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:07.670
to Utah, and that's a place
I don't know very well,

01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:13.010
but which I've visited
and I liked very much.

01:04:13.010 --> 01:04:18.970
Perhaps that only has to do with my
personal limitations as an author.

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:26.380
&gt;&gt; There are a lot of
Italians from [inaudible],

01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:29.800
many [inaudible] that emigrated.

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:35.280
Can you talk a little bit
about why [inaudible] that part

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:37.360
of [inaudible] that came here?

01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:41.530
&gt;&gt; Well, it was a very poor part
of Italy, especially my part

01:04:41.530 --> 01:04:45.840 position:56%
of Abruzzo, so really the
Apennines, those villages used to --

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:50.900
in fact, when you go there,
you see some ghost villages

01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:54.650
where they were extremely,
extremely poor.

01:04:54.650 --> 01:05:01.120
There's this beautiful novel
by [inaudible] from Tamara,

01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:03.650
takes place during
the fascist years,

01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:04.950
but they also [inaudible] like,

01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:10.110
the historical reasons
why this part was so poor.

01:05:10.110 --> 01:05:13.740
But also geographically, there
aren't a lot of resources,

01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:17.890
it's very hard, the
land is very barren.

01:05:17.890 --> 01:05:21.790
So that's why you find a lot of
people from Abruzzo, but especially

01:05:21.790 --> 01:05:26.170
from the province of L'Aquila
[inaudible] who have left.

01:05:26.170 --> 01:05:28.470
Absolutely.

01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:33.340
&gt;&gt; You call --

01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:34.640
&gt;&gt; OK.

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:35.940
&gt;&gt; You're in charge.

01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:37.240
&gt;&gt; Back there.

01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:38.540
&gt;&gt; She's in charge.

01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:39.840
&gt;&gt; I didn't come here with
any special expectations,

01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:47.810
but the novel seems the
perfect gift for a friend I have

01:05:47.810 --> 01:05:51.980
in Santa Monica who
is from [inaudible].

01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:53.280
But I'm not clear.

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:54.580
Is the book for sale [inaudible]?

01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:55.880
&gt;&gt; No, not here.

01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:59.970
&gt;&gt; Is it for sale in the
US or only from Italy?

01:05:59.970 --> 01:06:01.930
&gt;&gt; The books -- sorry for
the commercial pitch --

01:06:01.930 --> 01:06:12.260 position:56%
but the book can be ordered by a
variety of sites, so like, Amazon --

01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:13.560
&gt;&gt; In the US?

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:16.340
&gt;&gt; In the US, I found
that the best way --

01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:19.740
and again, this is a site I'm
not at all connected with,

01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:21.620
I don't get a percentage from it --

01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:25.700
but the best site is
bookdepository.com

01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:31.450
because they ship anywhere in the
world without shipping charges.

01:06:31.450 --> 01:06:36.330
And the price is very good because
the price is, you know, 13 euros;

01:06:36.330 --> 01:06:39.390
in Italy, they charge $15.

01:06:39.390 --> 01:06:43.050
So it's really a fair conversion.

01:06:43.050 --> 01:06:49.870
So that's the best way I've
found to order books from the US.

01:06:49.870 --> 01:06:52.850
&gt;&gt; And one last question.

01:06:52.850 --> 01:06:55.620
Since you had so much
trouble with the title,

01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:57.600
I assume it's not being translated.

01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:02.050
But is any translation [inaudible]?

01:07:02.050 --> 01:07:05.430
&gt;&gt; Now, this inspired me actually,
this work that we did from Emily.

01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:07.880
She looks at me with fear.

01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:11.680
Because there are two people
-- Louise and Emily --

01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:16.930
who have to fear my
ambitions with English.

01:07:16.930 --> 01:07:20.440
But anyway, I am working
on a translation, yes,

01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:22.170
but it's not for the near future.

01:07:22.170 --> 01:07:28.530
So if somebody can read Italian,
I would go with the Italian.

01:07:28.530 --> 01:07:31.510
Unless Emily has a
lot of spare time.

01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:34.620
[ Laughter ]

01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:35.920
&gt;&gt; Go ahead.

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:40.310
&gt;&gt; Dr. Benedetti, tell us a little
bit about your moving from Harvard

01:07:40.310 --> 01:07:43.540
to Georgetown and sort
of a comparison.

01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:48.000
As a graduate in linguistics from
Georgetown, I'd be interested

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.660
in the comparison of the
two wonderful universities.

01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:56.830
&gt;&gt; Well, you know, to be
honest, perhaps the simplest way

01:07:56.830 --> 01:08:03.550
to explain this is that my daughter
just started college at Georgetown.

01:08:03.550 --> 01:08:09.180 position:56%
And you know, we always thought --
my husband also taught at Harvard --

01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:14.950
and we always thought that
Georgetown does an excellent job.

01:08:14.950 --> 01:08:17.010
And yeah.

01:08:17.010 --> 01:08:18.310
[ Laughter ]

01:08:18.310 --> 01:08:19.980
I don't know if I can add anything.

01:08:19.980 --> 01:08:21.280
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible].

01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:22.580
Thank you.

01:08:22.580 --> 01:08:23.880
&gt;&gt; More questions?

01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:25.180
Feel free.

01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:29.800
Go ahead.

01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:53.130 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Benedetti, can you comment
on how Alice was living in a country

01:08:53.130 --> 01:09:02.870
but [inaudible] also living un
paese di carta, the old country?

01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:09.280
How did these two backgrounds
[inaudible] in her personality,

01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:14.620
and did they make her stronger or
did they present some downsides?

01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:18.590
&gt;&gt; She definitely had
some problems adjusting.

01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:21.520
But I thought that more than
-- yeah, it's interesting.

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:22.990
She had problems adjusting.

01:09:22.990 --> 01:09:29.230
But since I don't go too much into
her life, this is like the clash

01:09:29.230 --> 01:09:33.540
of cultures is not really analyzed
as far as Alice is concerned,

01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:39.790
but there is more of a discussion
of that when Sarah goes to Italy.

01:09:39.790 --> 01:09:43.150
At that point, since Sarah has
lived in un paesa di carta as well,

01:09:43.150 --> 01:09:46.790
because she has learned Italian
that her grandmother taught her,

01:09:46.790 --> 01:09:50.620
so she has several problems
already using a language

01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:54.400
that is way too elegant and
refined for contemporary Italians.

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:58.020 position:56%
So she speaks Italian very well, but
her Italian is somewhat literary.

01:09:58.020 --> 01:09:59.910 position:56%
Or adjusting to the various Italian
habits and idiosyncrasies, you know.

01:09:59.910 --> 01:10:01.210
So --

01:10:01.210 --> 01:10:03.080
-- Sarah was very important
to me because she allowed me

01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:08.840
to show a country and also the
situation of the earthquake

01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:13.800
as if I were seeing
it for the first time.

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:18.090
Again, you know, the Russian
formalists call this [inaudible]

01:10:18.090 --> 01:10:22.470
or estrangement, having a character
who is new to a certain situation

01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:29.740
and therefore allows a writer
to present a situation as if he

01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:32.450
or she were seeing it
for the first time.

01:10:32.450 --> 01:10:39.540
So it's Sarah more than Alice
who deals with the two worlds.

01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:41.580
Absolutely.

01:10:41.580 --> 01:10:43.840
&gt;&gt; Go ahead.

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:47.830
&gt;&gt; Yes. The novel is
fantastic I thought, you know.

01:10:47.830 --> 01:10:56.550
But it's also a novel about
language -- it's not just a story,

01:10:56.550 --> 01:11:01.470
but it is a commentary
on Italian language.

01:11:01.470 --> 01:11:08.930
And as such, it defines the paese
di carta, the language itself.

01:11:08.930 --> 01:11:17.360
And in fact, as a librarian, Alice
pays a lot of attention to grammar.

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:21.900
And she talks about the use
of a subjunctive, for example,

01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:26.140 position:56%
with a lot of examples explaining it

01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:30.230
to the granddaughter,
which was Sarah.

01:11:30.230 --> 01:11:33.110
And this is only one
example of attention

01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:36.030
to language, but there were many.

01:11:36.030 --> 01:11:43.020
And I wonder how would you
address this in translation?

01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:44.940
It's almost impossible.

01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:50.760
&gt;&gt; I love that question because
it's a beautiful part of the book.

01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:52.060
And I had made a note --

01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:54.830
another example, you were
mentioning the subjunctive,

01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:58.060
and at another point, Alice
talks about the passato remoto --

01:11:58.060 --> 01:11:59.820
&gt;&gt; Passato remoto.

01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:01.120
Yes.

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:04.000
&gt;&gt; -- which is one form
of the past tense in --

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.140
&gt;&gt; Which does not exist in English.

01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:10.580
&gt;&gt; Right. And which is sort of
something that Alice is saying,

01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:14.280
is it's falling into disuse in
Italy, even though it's so elegant

01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:18.710 position:56%
and conveys meaning beyond what
sort of the normal past tense would.

01:12:18.710 --> 01:12:22.240
And so I've written this down.

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:24.300
So it's Alice who says that,

01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:27.490
"The people who don't
use the passato remoto --

01:12:27.490 --> 01:12:32.290 position:56%
who don't use this tense -- that
they lose a dimension of their past.

01:12:32.290 --> 01:12:35.560
They're like the Romans who
stopped using the future tense,

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:37.510
and they lost their empire."

01:12:37.510 --> 01:12:41.310
[ Laughter ]

01:12:41.310 --> 01:12:42.610
Back to you.

01:12:42.610 --> 01:12:44.110
[ Laughter ]

01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:46.320
So there are two examples and --

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:53.710
&gt;&gt; Yes. Absolutely, "Un paese
di carta" is also the language,

01:12:53.710 --> 01:12:55.420
absolutely.

01:12:55.420 --> 01:13:00.070
And in fact, when I started
translating the book,

01:13:00.070 --> 01:13:03.310
I stopped precisely
there, the passato remoto,

01:13:03.310 --> 01:13:07.750
because I did not know how
to get around this problem.

01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:12.510
It's true because language
is very central in the novel.

01:13:12.510 --> 01:13:14.970
So the particular case of
the passato of remoto --

01:13:14.970 --> 01:13:18.300
so the passato remoto is this form
of the past that they use in Italy,

01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:20.810
so the remote past that they use

01:13:20.810 --> 01:13:25.100
in Italy is a very
literary [inaudible] past.

01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:34.020 position:56%
And the scene where this becomes
important is during the last evening

01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:37.970
that Alice spends with Jane.

01:13:37.970 --> 01:13:40.210
Alice dies the day after.

01:13:40.210 --> 01:13:43.010
And Alice -- since
she loves languages --

01:13:43.010 --> 01:13:46.830
when Jane, her daughter, goes
to visit her, she says, "Well,

01:13:46.830 --> 01:13:48.210
you know, I don't want to pray,"

01:13:48.210 --> 01:13:54.430
because Alice is also fiercely
secular in her approach to life,

01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:57.920
"But let's recite some conjugation.

01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:00.390
Let's recite some passato remoto."

01:14:00.390 --> 01:14:03.690
And Jane has a very
conflicted relation not only

01:14:03.690 --> 01:14:05.690
with her daughter,
but also with her mom.

01:14:05.690 --> 01:14:10.020
She says, "Ah, at the end of a
day at work, and now here I am,"

01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:12.520
you know, struggling
with this thing.

01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:17.040
But Alice insists, and so she
says, you know, she starts with,

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:25.740 position:56%
"To be born in the passato remoto,
then to grow up, then love and die."

01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:28.620
That's how the chapter
ends with [inaudible],

01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:34.370
with the passato remoto, the
conjugation of passato remoto.

01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:38.750
It's important -- it's not
just a grammar point --

01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:42.200
Alice is afraid of the
past, her experience,

01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:45.220
her entire life goes lost.

01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:48.840
And that's why I was saying
the book is a positive book,

01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:52.900
because in the end, Sarah does
manage to reconstruct the story,

01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:57.310
so the passato remoto is not lost.

01:14:57.310 --> 01:15:04.750
So it's not an [inaudible], you
know, trivial grammar point,

01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:09.500 position:56%
it's really essential to the way the
character sees the world and also

01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:12.280 position:56%
to the way the novel is constructed.

01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:15.710
It's going to be very
challenging to do that in English.

01:15:15.710 --> 01:15:23.710
So in fact, there had to be
another novel altogether perhaps.

01:15:23.710 --> 01:15:30.930
Yeah. I haven't come across
a possible solution to that.

01:15:30.930 --> 01:15:36.210
Oh, there is another passage
when Alice writes to the man,

01:15:36.210 --> 01:15:39.350 position:56%
her fiancé in Italy, the only letter

01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:44.140
that she writes to
her fiancé in Italy.

01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:49.760
She says she gets really interested

01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:53.400
in another tense, the
past condition.

01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:55.820
And she says, "There
are some languages

01:15:55.820 --> 01:15:59.560 position:56%
that don't have the past condition,"
and apparently this is true,

01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:05.560
"And so therefore, you cannot say
oh, if I had not gone to England,

01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:07.930
I would be a happy person now.

01:16:07.930 --> 01:16:09.230
You cannot say that.

01:16:09.230 --> 01:16:12.520
Once you have not gone to
England, you cannot resurrect

01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:17.970
that possibility even for
like, a rhetorical game."

01:16:17.970 --> 01:16:24.200
And so Alice says, "So we
should do the same thing.

01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:26.780
I abolish the conditional past.

01:16:26.780 --> 01:16:31.340
I don't want to think about
what would have happened

01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:32.670
if I had stayed."

01:16:32.670 --> 01:16:35.060
So there are many observations
like that,

01:16:35.060 --> 01:16:37.600
but the conditional past
works in English as well.

01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:42.510
But the passato remoto is
probably doomed to disappearance.

01:16:42.510 --> 01:16:47.080
[ Laughter ]

01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:48.380
&gt;&gt; More questions?

01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:52.440
&gt;&gt; I have a comment and a question.

01:16:52.440 --> 01:17:07.620
A comment about the issue of the
lost -- and we talked about that,

01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:15.090
you guys talked about that.

01:17:15.090 --> 01:17:32.190
I actually found [inaudible]
that it's actually a novel

01:17:33.260 --> 01:17:40.090
of discovery and recovery.

01:17:40.090 --> 01:17:50.340
Discovery because with Sarah, we
get to know the past of Alice --

01:17:50.340 --> 01:17:54.750
her life or what probably
Jane didn't even know.

01:17:54.750 --> 01:17:59.210
So we get reconnected through
generations [inaudible].

01:17:59.210 --> 01:18:10.640
And then the recovery from Alice,
and she actually moves back

01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:11.940
to the place [inaudible].

01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:13.240 position:56%
And we discover [inaudible] L'Aquila

01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:14.540
and then she gets reconnected
[inaudible].

01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:15.840
So I found that very
positive in this sense.

01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:17.140
And then my question is -- Alice --

01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:18.440
Alice for me is a very interesting
character and I loved her.

01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:19.740
And it felt so realistic.

01:18:19.740 --> 01:18:21.040
Like, I really, when I read the
book, I felt like she was there.

01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:22.340
And she's connected
to [inaudible] events

01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:23.640
in Italy that actually happened.

01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:24.940
So we get to know history --
a part of history in the book.

01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:26.240
Just to make it short,
I didn't know anything

01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:27.540
about nine martyrs
before reading the book.

01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:28.840
So when I read the book, I
thought there was like [inaudible].

01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:30.140
So I looked it up on the
internet and I saw a video.

01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:31.440
I watched a video about a lady
who actually was there the day

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:32.740
that those nine kids -- young
people -- were captured.

01:18:32.740 --> 01:18:34.040
And I said, "Oh, she
must have known Alice."

01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:35.340
[ Laughter ]

01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:36.640
So for me, Alice was so realistic,

01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:38.500
that I actually thought
she was a real person.

01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:44.110
So my question is who
is Alice, like,

01:18:44.110 --> 01:18:48.990
who inspired you to
write about Alice?

01:18:48.990 --> 01:18:50.990
&gt;&gt; No, no, no, I don't
have anyone --

01:18:50.990 --> 01:18:52.370
&gt;&gt; The story is fiction.

01:18:52.370 --> 01:18:54.130
&gt;&gt; Yes. Totally fictional.

01:18:54.130 --> 01:18:55.970 position:56%
But as I said, she became very real,

01:18:55.970 --> 01:18:58.310
and perhaps that's why
I could not abandon her.

01:18:58.310 --> 01:19:08.550
But no, there is no inspiration,
no real person who inspired that.

01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:14.060
&gt;&gt; Is there time for
one more question?

01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:15.610
&gt;&gt; Yes, there is.

01:19:15.610 --> 01:19:16.910
&gt;&gt; Sure, of course.

01:19:16.910 --> 01:19:19.390
Let's hear his question and then --

01:19:19.390 --> 01:19:20.690
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible].

01:19:20.690 --> 01:19:21.990
I have a question.

01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:24.920
You mentioned this taking
a long time to write.

01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:31.360
I was just wondering -- you talked
about '94 you found notes from.

01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:35.910
I was wondering what kind of --
if your thinking has changed,

01:19:35.910 --> 01:19:39.960
what has changed over the years
that has given you insight

01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:43.190
into maybe the characters
or "Un paese di carta".

01:19:43.190 --> 01:19:46.780
I'm just wondering the evolution
of your thinking on this.

01:19:46.780 --> 01:19:51.000
&gt;&gt; The notes from 1994 were
actually about Thanksgiving dinner.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:54.850
So this family, you know,
it's like all families,

01:19:54.850 --> 01:19:56.620
it's a bit dysfunctional.

01:19:56.620 --> 01:19:59.760
So they all fight together
around the Thanksgiving table

01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:01.180
and there are some tensions.

01:20:01.180 --> 01:20:06.030
And this was the part
that I was trying to --

01:20:06.030 --> 01:20:07.730
completely different
setting, though.

01:20:07.730 --> 01:20:15.000
The idea I was working on in 1994,
a very almost theatrical piece,

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:19.760
although I intended to
write a novel -- a family.

01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:23.640
You know, everybody is there
with their little things.

01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:29.700
And there is one person who is ill
and would like to tell everybody.

01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:35.600
But at the end of the day, she
does not manage to say anything --

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:38.070
which in the novel, is Jane.

01:20:38.070 --> 01:20:43.510
And Jane thinks she's ill,
actually, she's not ill at all.

01:20:43.510 --> 01:20:48.620
But she thinks she's ill, but
she doesn't have the conversation

01:20:48.620 --> 01:20:52.770
at the dinner table,
goes completely crazy

01:20:52.770 --> 01:20:56.910
because Sarah has some big
revelations for everybody.

01:20:56.910 --> 01:21:00.880 position:56%
Anyway, everything goes wrong and
she does not manage to say anything.

01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:05.000
But those were the notes
that I found from 1994

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:10.680
that somehow then merged
with the rest of novel.

01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:15.490
The novel itself, when I
started really writing it,

01:21:15.490 --> 01:21:21.980
I wrote it with those different
breaks from different times

01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:23.450
in a relatively short time,

01:21:23.450 --> 01:21:25.390
six or seven months I
had written the novel.

01:21:25.390 --> 01:21:29.500
The rest was just revising
it and trying

01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:32.380
to make the characters
more believable.

01:21:32.380 --> 01:21:36.440 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I think you had another question.

01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:37.950
&gt;&gt; One more question.

01:21:37.950 --> 01:21:40.880
Yes. I go back to the [inaudible].

01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:43.450 position:56%
You mentioned that Alice is a rebel.

01:21:43.450 --> 01:21:46.540
Right. And so is Sarah.

01:21:46.540 --> 01:21:51.510
And in between, we have
Jane who is not the rebel,

01:21:51.510 --> 01:21:55.790
she is a rather conformist
type of character.

01:21:55.790 --> 01:22:03.130
But Alice and Sarah
rebelled in a similar way.

01:22:03.130 --> 01:22:09.550
Alice runs out -- runs
away with a man.

01:22:09.550 --> 01:22:16.280
And this [inaudible] period
of time, at that time,

01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:20.210
it was a very rebellious
thing to do.

01:22:20.210 --> 01:22:27.690
Nowadays, it's not, it's very
normal, very everyday occurrence.

01:22:27.690 --> 01:22:31.280
Now, you don't have to run away,

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:35.300
you can just live next
door with a partner.

01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:40.300 position:56%
So Sarah rebels in a different way,
she has a relationship with a woman.

01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:48.630
And in our time it's
not so normal yet.

01:22:49.990 --> 01:22:55.980 position:56%
So is this something [inaudible] to
create a [inaudible] between the two

01:22:55.980 --> 01:23:01.400
of them with the similar,
let's say breakaway

01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:04.880
that connotes their rebellion?

01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:07.610
&gt;&gt; Yeah. There's definitely
some spiritual affinity

01:23:07.610 --> 01:23:12.390 position:56%
between Alice and Sarah, definitely.

01:23:12.390 --> 01:23:14.120
They are both rebellious.

01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:20.640
My idea was that -- so the story is
that Sarah is sent for a gap year

01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:23.170
out west because she
has several problems,

01:23:23.170 --> 01:23:26.300
especially she likes
alcohol a bit too much.

01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:29.210
And there, the story
of her discovery

01:23:29.210 --> 01:23:33.890
of her homosexuality was really
-- almost came from the landscape,

01:23:33.890 --> 01:23:37.460
you know, from the
[inaudible] National Park

01:23:37.460 --> 01:23:40.160
where she [inaudible]
of the [inaudible].

01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:49.930
She discovers a completely
different part of her country.

01:23:49.930 --> 01:23:55.150
She's very much -- Sarah is very
much product of the East Coast

01:23:55.150 --> 01:23:59.370
and she finds herself in a
completely different landscape.

01:23:59.370 --> 01:24:04.050
And as part of that discovery,
she also has this relationship

01:24:04.050 --> 01:24:10.630
with a woman which then the
relationship then creates some

01:24:10.630 --> 01:24:12.970
tension in the family.

01:24:12.970 --> 01:24:15.870
But sometimes she is also
almost imagined by --

01:24:15.870 --> 01:24:20.420
Sarah is always trying to find
reasons to gather her mother.

01:24:20.420 --> 01:24:24.320
So old poor Jane keeps telling
her, "Look, I couldn't care less,

01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:30.180
you know, this is [inaudible],"
and so on and so forth.

01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:35.090
But Sarah wants to have one more
reason to make her mother upset.

01:24:35.090 --> 01:24:40.570
And actually, this
interaction between Jane

01:24:40.570 --> 01:24:47.140
and Sarah really kept
me very, very busy,

01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:50.840
but I think that poor Jane caught

01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:56.560 position:56%
between these two rebels is actually
an interesting important character.

01:24:56.560 --> 01:25:02.690
It's just much more generous for
instance, much more open-minded

01:25:02.690 --> 01:25:05.570
that the two -- you
know, the old one

01:25:05.570 --> 01:25:10.560
and the young one would
believe she is.

01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:14.050
&gt;&gt; Well, I am sorry, but
we have to conclude here.

01:25:14.050 --> 01:25:18.230
I think it was a wonderful
presentation of this novel

01:25:18.230 --> 01:25:21.070
in English for the first time.

01:25:21.070 --> 01:25:22.390
So I'm very proud about that.

01:25:22.390 --> 01:25:23.690
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:25:23.690 --> 01:25:24.990
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Dr. Benedetti.

01:25:24.990 --> 01:25:26.290
Thank you, Emily.

01:25:26.290 --> 01:25:27.590
