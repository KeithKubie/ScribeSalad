00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.295
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh, did we forget
to have something?

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.150
DAN GALPIN: Hello, and welcome
to the Friday Games Review.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.060
I'm your host, Dan Galpin, and
with me, once again, is Ian

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.350
Ni-Lewis, filling
in for Koh Kim.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.010
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's right.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.360
Koh's got very important work to
do, so she's leaving us to

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.840
drink beer and play
games without her.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.960
DAN GALPIN: And speaking of
games, there are five on

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.130
today's list-- our crash-tastic
physics puzzler,

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.830
Spider Feeder.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.230
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's right.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.050
You have to click the button.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:38.550
DAN GALPIN: Oh, yeah.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.640
Deceptively simple Domino x4,
subliminally racist sorting

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.960
game, Metro Rush, unfortunately
named match

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.990
three game, Booty Quest,
and Space Ball.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.950
IAN NI-LEWIS: And speaking of
beer, I think it's definitely

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.780
time to open some up.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.290
Wow, that was great.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.520
So we're experimenting with
having a scripted opening,

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.920
which for most of our
shows has worked

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.760
really, really well.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.000
But this time, two issues--

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.940
first, I finished writing
the script at 3:02.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.380
And second, Dan's sitting here
like a jerk holding the button

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.500
where I can't see it.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.670
And I'm like, the slides
aren't even going.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:23.600
What's going on?

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.950
DAN GALPIN: Exactly.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.110
IAN NI-LEWIS: OK, now back up
because I have things to say.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.730
Speaking of beer--

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:35.510
OK, so today's beer is Green
Flash Brewing Company's Double

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.880
Stout Black Ale.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.040
DAN GALPIN: Excellent,
excellent.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.590
By the way, I can't go back to
that slide because one of the

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.800
really cool things is if you
have slide auto go forward,

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.880
you can't ever go back to it
ever again with the clicker.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:47.290
IAN NI-LEWIS: No way.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.930
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, it totally
prevents you from doing it.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:49.410
It sucks.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.800
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's awesome.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.530
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, exactly.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.740
So I definitely need
this beer today.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.360
IAN NI-LEWIS: We were going to
spend thousands of dollars on

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.930
teleprompting equipment.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.760
But then we were like, why
not just use Keynote?

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.010
We've got a Mac.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.280
DAN PHAM: Have either of you
guys noticed I'm wearing a

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.790
Green Flash Brewing shirt?

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:09.000
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.460
DAN GALPIN: Keynote needs a
little bit of work by its one

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.150
beta tester, I still think.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.420
IAN NI-LEWIS: Nice.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.820
Right.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.390
Dan Pham, we were going to blame
beer on him, but he says

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.460
he didn't buy it.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.410
So we actually don't
know who did.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.870
DAN GALPIN: All right.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.440
Stealing someone's beer.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.146
DAN PHAM: I'm actually wearing a
Green Flash shirt, but I did

00:02:27.146 --> 00:02:28.060
not bring that beer in.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.340
Although, I will vouch for it
as a great double stout.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.160
Good stuff.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.620
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, I definitely
liked their IPA,

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.990
which I think was called
Palate Wrecker.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.830
DAN GALPIN: That's a great
name for an IPA.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:39.600
IAN NI-LEWIS: So you'll
notice that we're

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.490
broadcasting today in space.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.480
DAN GALPIN: Yes, exactly.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.380
IAN NI-LEWIS: Let us know what
you think about this because

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.920
there have been haters.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.000
I'll tell you, we put this black
background up because we

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.720
thought it looked kinda boss.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.100
DAN GALPIN: Well, it looks
really, really good when you

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.410
guys have the lab
coats, actually.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.090
And by the way, the reason I'm
wearing this hoodie is

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.280
partially just so I can contrast
a little bit more

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.410
against the black background.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.500
IAN NI-LEWIS: You know, we put
up a massive, massive hair

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.342
light just to catch
the highlights off

00:03:09.342 --> 00:03:11.670
your majestic do.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.290
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, the highlights
off my skull.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.900
That's always good.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:15.980
DAN PHAM: We have a
comment already.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:16.875
Obi-Wan Droid.

00:03:16.875 --> 00:03:18.210
DAN GALPIN: Obi-Wan Droid.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.510
Nice.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.020
IAN NI-LEWIS: Nice.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.200
Sweet.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.530
All right, so we don't have a
producer today, but engineer

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.930
Dan's going to be watching the
comment stream because we're

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.810
too lazy to make him
do very much work.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.950
In fact, today is the end
of the quarter for us.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.370
We've been working on
performance reviews, which for

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.500
me means putting it off and Dan
Galpin means, once again,

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:46.660
writing a great review for me in
the attempt, yet again, to

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:47.610
get me promoted.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.812
Because I am the Susan Lucci of

00:03:50.812 --> 00:03:54.010
Android Developer Relations.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.280
DAN GALPIN: It was mostly that
all of our reviews are due at

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.750
exactly 11:59 and 59
seconds last night.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.410
And I was there until
11:59 and 59 seconds

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.110
still making comments.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.500
And then I was filing
bugs after that.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.640
So it's been a long night.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.730
So it was a great time to go.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.980
We were very excited about
getting to this crop of games

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.670
because I really needed some
distraction from all of this.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.065
IAN NI-LEWIS: And
I'm hung over.

00:04:18.065 --> 00:04:21.100
So let's go ahead and take
a look at our first game.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.360
Oh, wait.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.420
We can't.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.670
DAN GALPIN: No, no the first
game is Booty Quest.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:25.860
We can look at that.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.230
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh, OK.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.200
Spider--

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.490
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, do
you see the order?

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.910
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's right.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.880
Because in the script I just
put them in the order that

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.370
their names were funniest.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.550
Let's go ahead and
take a look at--

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.450
I can't believe you put
Booty Quest first.

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.780
DAN GALPIN: Arr, well, you know
it was talk like a pirate

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.520
week last week.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.460
And Booty Quest, it's a shame
you guys can't hear the audio

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.900
because the audio for
Booty Quest--

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.370
we can bring this up now--

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.940
the audio for Booty Quest is
actually kind of epic.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.840
It really does have lots of
great pirate stuff in it.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:54.510
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yo ho ho.

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.270
DAN GALPIN: And I love
their listing page.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.230
This is actually a really,
really good way of doing a

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.810
listing page.

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.210
The text is a great size.

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.370
It's very, very readable.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:05.810
You know immediately this
is going to be a

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.715
match four jewel game.

00:05:07.715 --> 00:05:08.270
Yum.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.790
It's got some great
characters in it.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.650
Looking at the actual listing,
my only thing I would want

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.180
them to change would be the icon
because I see no reason

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.210
to have a giant rounded corner
thing when you've got this

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.860
really cool bird character
that you could

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.060
totally have pop.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.120
And in fact out of the only
games, the only icon I really

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.790
liked out of all the games
was Space Ball.

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:27.880
We can continue to go
on this, though.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:28.440
All right.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.850
So let's get to the actual
Booty Quest.

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:33.960
Why does it say Metro Rush?

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.710
Wait, we'll stay
in Booty Quest.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.140
Aha, better.

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.230
IAN NI-LEWIS: You
go to the next--

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.360
DAN GALPIN: Oh, I screwed
this up totally.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.320
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.630
DAN GALPIN: And one
other problem.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.045
We have to actually plug
the tablet in.

00:05:47.045 --> 00:05:47.570
IAN NI-LEWIS: We do?

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.160
DAN GALPIN: Yes, we do because
the tablet's not plugged in.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.010
IAN NI-LEWIS: What,
but there's two--

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.610
DAN GALPIN: I know.

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.790
I know.

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.480
There's two inputs, but we're
not actually taking

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.430
advantage of that.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:56.905
IAN NI-LEWIS: Seriously,
why did I spend all

00:05:56.905 --> 00:05:57.850
the money on that?

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:58.530
DAN GALPIN: I know.

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.320
I know.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.320
IAN NI-LEWIS: You guys suck.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.710
DAN GALPIN: We do.

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:02.510
We totally do.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.160
All right, let's plug this in
and let's actually get in to

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.430
Booty Quest.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.460
Everyone's like, all right,
we're tuning out right now.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.250
These guys are jokesters, man.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.050
IAN NI-LEWIS: Actually, knowing
our audience, this is

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:15.830
probably when everybody's
going to tune in.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.700
DAN GALPIN: Absolutely, they'll
be like, oh, this is

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.490
so cool, these guys.

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.000
All right, so a couple
of things to note

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.110
here on Booty Quest.

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:23.680
First of all, there's some
really nice effects.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.570
The game has got actually
really great graphics.

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.710
And when we are playing it in
HDMI mode, we've got this

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.960
giant green line on the
right-hand side of the screen,

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.190
which is really kind of sad.

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:33.570
IAN NI-LEWIS: Are you serious?

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:34.370
That's not us?

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:35.040
DAN GALPIN: No, no.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.730
That's actually the
game itself.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:38.770
IAN NI-LEWIS: Nice.

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.560
DAN GALPIN: So everyone on
Android, you have to always

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.590
make sure that your game
really does need to do

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:48.730
something reasonable when you're
at 1.33 aspect ratio

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:52.920
all the way up to 1.77.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.520
And also, you can't just look at
the size that's coming back

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.170
from the display because you
actually have to look at the

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:59.390
size of the screen that
you're given.

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.470
So this may actually
be that problem.

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.505
That's a really common thing to
go on with games, is people

00:07:03.505 --> 00:07:06.320
will say hey, let's pull the
size of the display, let's

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.480
ignore the view that I'm
actually given, assume that

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.520
I'm asking for full screen, and
I'm just going to get the

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:11.270
whole thing.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:12.310
You just cannot do that.

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:13.140
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right, because
you won't always get it.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:14.130
DAN GALPIN: You can't do that.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:16.460
You're not always going to get
the full screen, especially on

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:17.420
these tablets.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.020
Although we did actually
make a change.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.080
The original Honeycomb tablets
would actually give you the

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.290
full screen size.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:23.240
And that screwed everybody up.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.570
They're like, wait, wait.

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.920
So in order to make things
slightly easier, we do only

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.620
give you the window now that
you're going to render in.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.980
But if you're plugged into HDMI,
you're still not going

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:31.640
to get all of that.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.760
IAN NI-LEWIS: All right, so now
let's go over to engineer

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.910
Daniel who's waving his
arms frantically.

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:36.820
DAN GALPIN: Oh, is he?

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.140
He's like, no one can
hear you, Dan.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:40.210
Your audio's completely
cutting off.

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:41.480
DAN PHAM: I'm actually just
interested in trying

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.350
some of that beer.

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:44.020
DAN GALPIN: Oh.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:45.770
IAN NI-LEWIS: I see.

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:47.610
DAN GALPIN: It is really good.

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:48.900
And boy did I need it today.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:49.980
IAN NI-LEWIS: It is
very good beer.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:51.390
Yeah.

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:55.590
By the way, we're going to do a
short show today because two

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:58.322
of these games crash and
four of them suck.

00:07:58.322 --> 00:07:59.650
So--

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:00.510
DAN GALPIN: That's not true.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:01.170
I wouldn't go that far.

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:03.830
Actually, only one of them
crashes on both devices.

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:05.320
One of them actually only
runs on the phone.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.180
We are going to switch to the
phone just to be nice and show

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:07.550
that one off.

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:10.560
IAN NI-LEWIS: Do you see why Dan
gets promoted and I don't?

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.360
Because he doesn't say things
like, your game sucks.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.500
I love you, Dan.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.140
DAN GALPIN: Mostly because I
write really great reviews.

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:18.988
DAN PHAM: I love
you guys, too.

00:08:18.988 --> 00:08:19.944
IAN NI-LEWIS: It's
true, you know.

00:08:19.944 --> 00:08:21.380
You're amazing.

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:22.750
DAN GALPIN: And I'm sorry
it says Metro Rush.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:23.780
This really isn't Metro Rush.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.100
This really is Booty Call.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.010
The game is fun.

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:28.860
I mean, honestly I like
match four games.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.690
IAN NI-LEWIS: It's more
of a match three game.

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:31.990
DAN GALPIN: Sorry, match
three games.

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:33.979
I don't know why I refer to
it as a match four game.

00:08:33.979 --> 00:08:36.419
It's a jewel matching game.

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:37.269
It's really, really well done.

00:08:37.269 --> 00:08:38.905
The animations and transitions
are smooth.

00:08:38.905 --> 00:08:40.640
There's some special
things going on.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.520
There's explosive gems.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.690
The thing is, this category
is so full.

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:47.830
There are so many jewel matching
games on Android.

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:49.805
IAN NI-LEWIS: This is
a great example of a

00:08:49.805 --> 00:08:50.530
jewel matching game.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.930
But yeah, there are
a lot of them.

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:56.460
Well, you know what, let's
take it on its own terms.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:57.840
The animation is great.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.110
I love that it's got a little
bit of reactive physics.

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:04.740
When things get removed, it
feels like they're kind of

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:08.350
blowing up, and when they fall
down they're getting--

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:10.360
there's definitely some
math going on

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.510
here, and I love that.

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:13.430
It feels so professional.

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:13.880
DAN GALPIN: Absolutely.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.050
The game is just really,
really fluid.

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:17.920
And it is really, actually,
fun to blow

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.790
things up with the gems.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:21.590
So definitely my hat's
off in terms of game.

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:23.880
I would say, the only thing is
in terms of depth, there are

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:27.510
some super, super deep matching
games out there with

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:29.380
all sorts of different scenarios
that are really

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.090
complicated.

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:32.830
And there's even, like, one of
the ones we actually looked

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:34.860
here, which was Rise of
Atlantis, actually takes you

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:38.950
through this epic quest as you
go through, with all sorts of

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:40.680
different side things
going on.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.260
So this is a really, really
full category.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:44.580
But this game is very good.

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:48.640
I mean, I see no reason why it
wouldn't be a candidate for

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:49.780
being featured.

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:52.840
It does reasonable things in
terms of the handling of the

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:56.100
back key, but not everywhere.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.490
Like, for example, not here.

00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:01.270
But one of the things it does
not actually do is it does not

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:03.430
correctly target multiple
displays.

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:03.910
We still have the

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:06.460
compatibility zoom button available.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:10.460
It's not targeting a new SDK
version, so we still have the

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:11.180
menu showing up.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:16.050
And we're still having JNI
compatibility stuff thrown in.

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:17.900
So there's a couple of things
I like in the change.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:19.550
I'd also like to make sure
that they're actually

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:22.010
correctly targeting
the screen.

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:22.700
IAN NI-LEWIS: Great stuff.

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:25.500
So let's go ahead and talk
about Metro Rush.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.110
So yeah, Metro Rush.

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:32.010
I found it interesting.

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:34.930
At first, I couldn't actually
figure it out.

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:37.530
And then what I did figure it
out, I found it a little bit

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:38.550
disturbing.

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:39.640
DAN GALPIN: The fact that
you're sorting different

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.780
colored people into different
colored cars--

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:42.290
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:43.890
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:46.425
IAN NI-LEWIS: So here's regular
mode as opposed to, I

00:10:46.425 --> 00:10:51.110
don't know, South Will
Rise Again mode.

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:54.350
So we get this train.

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:56.100
And you'll notice the train
has a very small

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:56.870
little green thing.

00:10:56.870 --> 00:11:01.120
So now, yeah, we gotta
sort all of the green

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:05.440
people into the cars.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.800
DAN GALPIN: And I think it's
supposed to represent the

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.590
route that they're going on.

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:11.900
But it just so happens that as
you're playing it, all the

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:13.820
green people look a lot alike.

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:14.740
Now we're orange.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:15.920
IAN NI-LEWIS: Then the
orange people.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.950
DAN GALPIN: And they all
have a different race.

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:20.750
I don't know why that's the--

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:21.885
IAN NI-LEWIS: Is that
guy orange?

00:11:21.885 --> 00:11:22.370
DAN GALPIN: Oh, there we are.

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:23.110
We do have two.

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:24.670
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh,
he was orange.

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:25.680
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.710
But it is sort of interesting.

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:28.410
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's cool.

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:31.960
The orange guys are
Irish, I think.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.250
DAN GALPIN: I think
you're right.

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:34.520
IAN NI-LEWIS: I guess so.

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.170
DAN GALPIN: Exactly.

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:39.080
So a couple things
about this game.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.340
One is that, yeah, it definitely
needs an intro to

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:43.850
be like, what am I doing here.

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:44.610
It is kind of weird.

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:46.590
If you miss the train, they just
kind of stand on top of

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:48.570
the train, which I
kind of liked.

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:50.020
IAN NI-LEWIS: So it's
a little buggy.

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:54.010
And let's face it, this mechanic
has been done before,

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:55.340
it's been done better.

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.110
Witness--

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:58.420
I call up the--

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.380
DAN GALPIN: My favorite thing
is this at the bottom.

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.680
Like, the five guys that are
all like standing to hop on

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:03.610
each other at the bottom
of the screen.

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:04.920
But yes, it it is
a little buggy.

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.380
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, you remember
that bathroom game

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:09.080
where they had first
men, women.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:09.970
Then there was dogs.

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:11.840
Then there was androids and
you had to sort them?

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:12.110
DAN GALPIN: Yes.

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:13.720
IAN NI-LEWIS: That was
a good sorting game.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.890
This game--

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:19.020
I mean, maybe if you're three.

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.890
DAN GALPIN: Well, and I'll say
some other things to note.

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:24.420
You can see that there is a
real, real problem with this

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:25.765
particular screen size
and resolution.

00:12:25.765 --> 00:12:28.052
And you can see the retry button
and the quit button are

00:12:28.052 --> 00:12:29.020
really squashed.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.000
And this actually goes--

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.010
do we even have--

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:32.885
IAN NI-LEWIS: To be fair, this
system's an easy resolution.

00:12:32.885 --> 00:12:36.180
It's not a common
aspect ratio.

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:38.190
DAN GALPIN: It's just the
resolution used by every

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:40.320
single Android tablet
out there.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:40.760
IAN NI-LEWIS: No, no.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:41.390
This isn't.

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:42.550
DAN GALPIN: Oh, yeah.

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:43.710
IAN NI-LEWIS: It's
in HDMI mode.

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:44.130
DAN GALPIN: Excuse me, yeah.

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:46.730
But even outside of HDMI mode,
it's still squashed.

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:49.550
IAN NI-LEWIS: So what I'm
saying, though, is that yeah,

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:51.690
the particular aspect ratio
that we're looking at is

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:54.020
extremely squashed because we're
in HDMI mode, and it's a

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:54.750
little bit weird.

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:56.620
DAN GALPIN: But let me point
one thing out there.

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:57.310
Sorry, go on.

00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:59.880
So this is actually
their listing.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.490
And the listing also has a
completely squashed and

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:05.030
different aspect ratio
from the actual game.

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:09.320
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, but my point
really is that phones

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.420
are getting longer.

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:14.570
Aspect ratios change.

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:18.540
There is no device on the market
that I'm aware of that

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:22.060
will guarantee always being
the same forever.

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:25.860
With Android, the nice thing is
that at least we've thought

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:32.060
about that and gone through
the pain so that you can--

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:33.170
we have a new rule, right?

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:35.750
No static slides for more
than five seconds.

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:37.540
DAN GALPIN: So let's go back.

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:39.460
I just wanted to show that
because it was sort of

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:39.530
entertaining.

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:43.650
And I did want to actually
mention that this is also not

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:47.110
a particularly good
listing page.

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:49.170
But it is representative
of the game, at

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:49.910
least, which is good.

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:52.090
There's a lot of listings
that aren't.

00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:54.030
IAN NI-LEWIS: Anyway, to be
fair, I guess what I was

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:57.180
trying to say is, Android gives
you the tools to deal

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:58.905
with these aspect
ratio changes.

00:13:58.905 --> 00:14:00.920
And especially when you're doing
vector graphics, there

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:04.350
really shouldn't be any reason
to make these mistakes.

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:05.490
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:06.470
IAN NI-LEWIS: Now I've
said my piece.

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:07.300
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, that's good.

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:09.310
IAN NI-LEWIS: Dan, I'm
going to shut up now.

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:10.920
DAN PHAM: I have a really
important question from

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.210
someone on YouTube.

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:12.820
DAN GALPIN: Oh.

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:13.780
Important.

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:17.440
DAN PHAM: The question is, how
can you play with beer?

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.480
IAN NI-LEWIS: How can we
not play with beer?

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.150
Have you tried this game?

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.550
Don't do it in a dry county,
that's all I'm saying.

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:31.020
DAN GALPIN: All right, well,
I think that pretty

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:33.110
much says it all.

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:35.340
I mean, there's some
good ideas here.

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.710
It definitely needs to
feel more fluid.

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:42.390
My basic complaint with this
game, and I think part of it

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:44.980
is the aspect ratio, I think it
is having trouble dealing

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:47.840
with touches and with handling
the characters on this

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.700
particular screen.

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.860
IAN NI-LEWIS: And also, when
you're doing a sorting game

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:53.830
like this--

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:55.060
and I'll tell you what the main

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:56.450
problem is with the mechanics.

00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:58.230
Let's talk about the things
they did right.

00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:59.430
They did vector graphics.

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:01.570
And the vector graphics look
really, really good.

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:02.660
So those turned out well.

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:03.990
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:06.100
I think they're high-res
Illustrator graphics that have

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:07.170
been rendered.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:08.720
I don't think they're actually
vector here.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.570
I think they've just been
rendered into bitmaps.

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:12.780
IAN NI-LEWIS: Quite possible.

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:16.140
The basic game idea, there's
nothing wrong with it.

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:19.205
I would say the interaction
is a little difficult.

00:15:19.205 --> 00:15:22.310
A sorting game like this, you
probably want to have a little

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:26.000
bit of momentum physics so that
it doesn't turn into a

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.590
laborious dragging game where
you're fighting the interface

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:30.580
more than you're fighting
the game.

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:31.650
DAN GALPIN: And I was going to
say, on a phone it's not so

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:33.380
bad because you don't
have to drag as far.

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.530
But as soon as you get to a
tablet, if you don't actually

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:38.150
have the physics built into it,
then you really are just,

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:39.840
oh, I'm dragging this
thing across the

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:40.720
screen again and again.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.940
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, and you saw
many times Dan made this

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:43.510
same mistake.

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:46.820
You let go just a fraction
of a second too early.

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:50.920
And instead of getting in and
giving you points, you just

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:51.540
hit a bug, basically.

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:52.840
DAN GALPIN: It floats
to the top.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:54.660
IAN NI-LEWIS: The guy just
sits on top of the train

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:56.590
looking weird.

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:58.490
It's really great when the train
then takes off and runs

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:00.710
them all over, by the way,
which it does do.

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:02.620
But there's no running
over [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:03.710
IAN NI-LEWIS: I guess, yeah.

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:05.130
It's kind of fun.

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:08.710
Anyway, this is some great
programming, no

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:09.360
question about it.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:10.855
It's just, it's not finished.

00:16:10.855 --> 00:16:12.010
It's not a finished game.

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:13.770
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, it
needs more work.

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:14.110
IAN NI-LEWIS: All right.

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:14.800
Let's move on.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:15.230
DAN GALPIN: All right.

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:19.870
So our next title in all of
this, let's go back--

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:22.080
this was the fun one for us.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.553
This a game that we actually
were unable to get to run on

00:16:24.553 --> 00:16:24.910
any of our devices.

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:25.950
IAN NI-LEWIS: I can't even tell
you how much I wanted to

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:26.470
play this game.

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:28.360
DAN GALPIN: Yeah,
we were excited.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:29.720
Well, actually, looking at
the listing, we weren't

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.550
particularly excited.

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:31.690
IAN NI-LEWIS: No, I
was really stoked.

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:32.490
I watched their video.

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:32.770
It looked good.

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:33.280
DAN GALPIN: Oh, OK.

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.670
OK, looking at the listing,
I wasn't sure.

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:38.350
You can see that if you had this
on a device, you would

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:43.040
never be able to
read the text.

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.970
And I can't read it from here.

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:49.031
Well, I can read the
title barely.

00:16:49.031 --> 00:16:51.210
IAN NI-LEWIS: And part of the
problem too is that they

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:53.730
haven't differentiated the
title and the tagline.

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:58.170
If you look at, let's say, a
movie poster, the title is

00:16:58.170 --> 00:16:59.680
big, the tagline is small.

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.000
It's a good tagline
as taglines go.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.240
DAN GALPIN: The spider
is hungry.

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:04.890
IAN NI-LEWIS: You
have to feed it.

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:05.579
DAN GALPIN: You have
to feed it.

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:07.170
IAN NI-LEWIS: OK.

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:11.050
But instead, it's like Spider
Feeder, the spider hungry, you

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:12.160
have to feed it.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:16.349
It doesn't look like a listing,
it looks like a meme.

00:17:16.349 --> 00:17:16.900
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:20.160
So this game failed to load
because it couldn't actually

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.720
get a class that it needed,
which caused its main

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.310
class to not load.

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:28.640
So all we're going to have
is a green screen.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:29.630
I will show you what happened.

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:31.000
I will launch it here.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.510
And you'll get, unfortunately
Spider Feeder has stopped,

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:34.430
which is very sad.

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:35.750
IAN NI-LEWIS: So what
class was it?

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:39.300
DAN GALPIN: Unfortunately, when
you have a class that is

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:42.820
from the main activity class, it
prevents the main activity

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:46.200
class from loading, but you
can't see what it is.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.390
Because you just see, oh,
the main activity

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:49.290
class failed to load.

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:52.990
Because one of the things it's
depending on wasn't there.

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:55.680
IAN NI-LEWIS: You should be
able to see, there's the

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:58.540
really long listing and you
get down to the bottom.

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:01.560
DAN GALPIN: It depends
on where it crashes,

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:02.270
unfortunately.

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:03.890
IAN NI-LEWIS: Did
you strace it?

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:06.310
DAN GALPIN: I did
not strace it.

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:08.180
I just used logcat on it.

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:09.380
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, you probably
wouldn't have gotten

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:10.270
much out of it.

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:12.690
DAN GALPIN: With strace,
unfortunately, this is all

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:13.150
deck stuff.

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:14.540
So strace would just
let me know it was

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:16.220
trying to load a file.

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:17.330
strace is really cool, though.

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:18.930
If you're trying to debug native
stuff, it's actually

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:23.080
really, really useful to know
which call your app made that

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:23.980
caused things to crash.

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:25.680
So definitely thumbs
up on strace.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:29.310
We actually made a nice
update to that tool in

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:30.350
the last six months.

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:31.420
So if you haven't used
it recently--

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:31.873
IAN NI-LEWIS: This is awesome.

00:18:31.873 --> 00:18:32.260
Check that out.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:33.650
DAN GALPIN: Oh, yeah.

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:36.730
We're very close to being able
to install Jelly Bean on our

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:39.760
little Transformer Prime here,
which is very exciting.

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.820
And I'm hoping it'll work
because that'll be fun.

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:44.710
But I didn't want to do it right
before this show just in

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:47.790
case something went wrong.

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:49.050
IAN NI-LEWIS: How could
that happen?

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:50.540
That would be really
surprising.

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:51.830
DAN GALPIN: Yeah,
it'd shocking.

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:56.990
So the next app we're going to
actually look at is Domino x4.

00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:59.430
And this game is a really
beautifully done--

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:00.050
IAN NI-LEWIS: Was I right?

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:01.540
Is this a deceptively
simple game?

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.900
DAN GALPIN: It is.

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:05.220
IAN NI-LEWIS: I hadn't
even played the game.

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:05.985
I was writing the script.

00:19:05.985 --> 00:19:07.640
I'm like, oh, dominoes.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:08.910
I bet it's deceptively simple.

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:10.770
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, this is
actually really fun.

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:11.680
It's a puzzle game.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.670
It's a time-based game.

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:15.240
Here's what the listing
looks like, which is

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.150
actually pretty good.

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:17.450
It's pretty representative
of the game.

00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:18.920
You see, we actually
get some nice.

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.600
Because it's got green on it,
we're getting some green

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.520
screen showing through with our
little presentation here.

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:26.820
Yeah, you can see
us behind there.

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:29.330
And I would still like the text
to be slightly larger.

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:32.950
And just that font, I've never
liked for this kind of thing.

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:34.200
But it's fun.

00:19:36.645 --> 00:19:39.530
But it's everyone's taste.

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:41.750
However, we actually get to
the game itself, and I'll

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:42.840
launched it here
on the tablet.

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.510
And you'll see why this game
we're actually going to switch

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:46.770
to the phone.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:48.480
First of all, menu looks fine.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.630
Not exciting.

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:51.130
The text, you can see,
is kind of small.

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:53.750
That's because we're ending
up [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:54.140
domino.

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:56.750
And that's because we're
on an MDPI device.

00:19:56.750 --> 00:20:00.100
And these things just look
huge on an MDPI device.

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:03.970
When you're actually looking at
how do I make my app scale

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:06.870
for the tablets, sometimes it
makes sense to actually select

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:08.110
a different resource type.

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:09.720
And you can actually do that.

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.320
So that's one thought here.

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.390
And we actually go
to new game.

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:17.000
And you can see--

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:17.880
IAN NI-LEWIS: Wow.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:21.350
It is deceptively simple.

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:22.560
DAN GALPIN: It's just
not playable.

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:25.070
IAN NI-LEWIS: No,
this is awesome.

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:26.280
Oh my god.

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.740
Best game or best game ever?

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:30.260
How do I play it?

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:31.050
What do we do?

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:33.000
DAN GALPIN: You rotate
the dominoes.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.490
And as you can see,
unfortunately--

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:38.540
IAN NI-LEWIS: It's like
a Nyquist game.

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:41.790
Oh yeah, this domino doesn't
just affect itself.

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:44.860
It affects dots in other
dominoes as well.

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:47.680
DAN GALPIN: So unfortunately,
what we're seeing here is that

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:52.450
the matrix that's being used
to scale the bitmap is just

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:54.630
not correct for this screen
size and resolution.

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:56.610
And so we're just
seeing the dots.

00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:59.370
They're actually all overlapping
each other.

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:02.070
And the game is not playable.

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:05.350
But because we are trying to
make sure that you guys can

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:07.680
actually see how the game is
played, we're now going to

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.440
switch from the tablet view--

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.810
you'll see us lose this
momentarily--

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:15.640
to our trusty Galaxy Nexus.

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:16.220
All right.

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:17.300
Yes.

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.470
IAN NI-LEWIS: I love how we
have this great on-screen

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:22.030
animation and everything looks
really smooth, but it's the

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:25.720
result of you picking up a
cord off the floor and

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.720
plugging it into
something else.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.020
DAN GALPIN: I know.

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:30.390
IAN NI-LEWIS: We're so
low tech/high tech.

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:31.130
DAN GALPIN: I know.

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:31.960
And Daniel's hard work.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.250
So here is Domino.

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:34.120
And here's what it looks like.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:35.860
Now, there are some rendering
problems,

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:36.800
even on Galaxy Nexus.

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.500
You can see that it's cut off.

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:42.280
I'm not sure why this is
actually the case because it

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.820
doesn't actually happen--

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:45.270
IAN NI-LEWIS: At this point,
I don't even know what I'm

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:45.910
looking at.

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:46.210
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:48.340
So what's actually going on here
is you're seeing a couple

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:49.100
of rendering problems.

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:51.860
It's worse with HDMI because
you're getting a slightly

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:53.270
different screen size
there as well.

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:56.630
If you actually get it full
screen, it's less cut off.

00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:57.960
But as you can see, at
least we can see the

00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:58.620
game to play it.

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:02.070
So we can rotate the dominoes
so that they line up.

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:05.820
And the goal is to get
bricks of dominoes

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:07.480
that line up together--

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:10.300
this is actually really hard
to play with HDMI because I

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:16.165
can't see how many dots are
actually on each domino.

00:22:16.165 --> 00:22:17.415
IAN NI-LEWIS: So what do you
think they're doing there?

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:21.380
DAN GALPIN: I'm not
sure, honestly.

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:24.480
I'd have to look at
their layout.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.880
If I had a little more time, I
would have actually tried to

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.080
pull apart their layout and
see why it's wrong.

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.380
IAN NI-LEWIS: Don't
lean against that.

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:31.950
God, how many times do
I have to tell you?

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:33.200
DAN GALPIN: It's so
soft, though.

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.920
We've got a soft velvet
background.

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.060
This thing looks
black, but it's

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:37.850
actually black and squishy.

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:39.950
IAN NI-LEWIS: As soon as I get
my glow in the dark paints,

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:40.995
Elvis, baby.

00:22:40.995 --> 00:22:42.325
DAN GALPIN: Nice.

00:22:42.325 --> 00:22:44.140
Yeah, actually, I'd
like black light.

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:45.870
That'd be kind of cool to do
a black light episode.

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:46.480
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh, that
would be rocking.

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:46.765
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:22:46.765 --> 00:22:47.890
We should totally do that.

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:51.390
IAN NI-LEWIS: We should do a
Halloween episode since we're

00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:53.900
about to be swamped
with zombie games.

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:54.650
DAN GALPIN: That it's true.

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:55.920
IAN NI-LEWIS: What made
zombies a thing?

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.270
Why are zombies such a
big deal these days?

00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:00.710
DAN GALPIN: I think it was the
zombie head that PopCap

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:03.230
created for Plants vs.
Zombies, I really do.

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:04.010
IAN NI-LEWIS: I guess.

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:04.190
I don't know.

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:06.520
DAN GALPIN: They spent, like,
$3,000 making this zombie

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.860
head, and it becomes
this viral video.

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:13.630
It's like that and "Gangnam
Style." That's what we're

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:14.945
going to see at Halloween.

00:23:14.945 --> 00:23:16.370
DAN PHAM: So it's safe to assume
that neither of you

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:19.110
guys have a zombie kit prepared
at home, right?

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:20.080
DAN GALPIN: I do, actually.

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.440
I have a zombie kit at home.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:24.210
In case of zombie invasion,
I'm totally set.

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:25.456
Except I don't have a shotgun.

00:23:25.456 --> 00:23:27.580
IAN NI-LEWIS: He didn't make
it for zombies, though.

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:29.735
He made it for Communists.

00:23:29.735 --> 00:23:30.050
DAN GALPIN: No, no.

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:30.930
Earthquakes, actually.

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:34.240
But it's earthquake/zombie
invasion.

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.967
IAN NI-LEWIS: My parents
had a Communist kit.

00:23:35.967 --> 00:23:36.761
DAN GALPIN: Did they really?

00:23:36.761 --> 00:23:38.420
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, as soon
as the invasion came--

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:40.420
DAN GALPIN: The Commie
invasion!

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:42.950
All right, so let's switch
back to the tablet.

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:43.840
I just wanted to show that.

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:46.380
Actually, without HDMI, it was
much, much more playable.

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:48.450
So I'm sad you guys can't see
the game because it's actually

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:49.760
really, really fun.

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:53.100
You're actually matching
different tetrominoes together

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.080
with the dominoes.

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:57.380
And so it's actually a very,
very clever game.

00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:59.515
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's
the Lemmings font.

00:23:59.515 --> 00:24:00.640
I wondered where I'd
seen that before.

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.700
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, it's totally
the Lemmings font.

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:03.940
I'm trying to remember
the name of it.

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:04.860
I think it's Cooper.

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:07.386
No, Cooper is the other plate.

00:24:07.386 --> 00:24:09.380
It'll come to me.

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:10.445
IAN NI-LEWIS: Copperplate?

00:24:10.445 --> 00:24:11.440
DAN GALPIN: It's not
Copperplate.

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:11.930
No, it is.

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:12.525
It's Cooper Black.

00:24:12.525 --> 00:24:12.950
That's right.

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:13.620
It's not Copperplate.

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:14.610
It's Cooper Black.

00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:15.190
That's what it is.

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:15.600
Yes.

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:16.790
Ha, ha.

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:18.200
IAN NI-LEWIS: Doesn't that
totally sound like a whiskey

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:18.990
or something?

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:21.150
DAN GALPIN: It should
be, yeah.

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:22.700
It would be great to make a
Cooper Black whiskey that

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:25.100
actually had the font
on the front.

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:27.120
All right, so we're
going to go to our

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.530
final game, which is--

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:29.530
IAN NI-LEWIS: Space Ball.

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:30.200
DAN GALPIN: Space Ball.

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.930
IAN NI-LEWIS: Which unlike the
rest of these, we had no idea

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:35.340
how to make a joke
out of this name.

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:36.960
DAN GALPIN: We're playing
with balls, man.

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.050
Come on.

00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:38.650
All right.

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:41.720
This one actually is our
only landscape game.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.020
Yeah, Mr. Pham.

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:44.690
All right.

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:45.170
IAN NI-LEWIS: Rock on!

00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:47.380
DAN GALPIN: High five to
our engineer, man.

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:49.800
He's been kicking some
serious booty.

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.220
IAN NI-LEWIS: We've got some
real problems here.

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:56.070
We've got a much more
professional set up, and yet

00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:58.360
we're not professional at all.

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:00.450
Hey, what happened to
the producer cam?

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:02.090
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, where's
the producer cam?

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:03.070
IAN NI-LEWIS: Dude, you
put it over there.

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:05.700
DAN PHAM: Actually, I
disconnected it so we could

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:07.500
have both tablet and
phone available.

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:09.030
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:11.660
So we have all of these cameras,
but we don't have a

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:15.190
power strip that actually has
a socket for it so we could

00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:17.210
plug both in at the same time.

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:19.530
DAN PHAM: Yeah, I don't think
the fire marshal would be too

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:22.495
happy with our electronic
set up.

00:25:22.495 --> 00:25:23.330
IAN NI-LEWIS: Dude,
don't say that.

00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:25.540
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:26.720
IAN NI-LEWIS: Look, there's a
power strip on the floor over

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.290
there that's got nothing
plugged into it at all.

00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:29.650
DAN GALPIN: That is
actually true.

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:30.810
There's several in this room.

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:32.320
It's completely safe.

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.240
IAN NI-LEWIS: And he has a power
strip over there that

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.630
could probably handle
a nuclear reactor.

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:38.410
DAN GALPIN: That thing
is amazing.

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:39.520
That is seriously kick butt.

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:42.930
It's meant to power soldering
irons and heat guns, and we

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:47.200
have it here for powering
laptops and phones.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:50.120
All right, so Space Ball.

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:51.350
First of all, I want to say--

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:52.770
IAN NI-LEWIS: First of all,
it's not Spaceballs.

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:53.600
It's Space Ball.

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:54.900
DAN GALPIN: It's Space Ball.

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:55.280
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:56.980
It's not a licensed property.

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:57.330
DAN GALPIN: Yes.

00:25:57.330 --> 00:25:59.930
Just in case you were curious,
even though it looks exactly,

00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:01.950
and the font seems like, and
actually it feels very

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:04.750
cartoony, very much like the
movie, this has nothing to do

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:05.800
with the movie, unless
I'm totally mistaken.

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:06.880
DAN GALPIN: Dude, I don't think
you're thinking about

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:07.830
Spaceballs.

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:11.210
I think you're thinking
about NBA Jam.

00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:13.530
IAN NI-LEWIS: So there's a
serious problem here, though.

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:14.780
I mean, look at this.

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:19.780
Now actually, our new studio
set up is really useful for

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:25.550
this because we are actually
about 10 to 12 feet away from

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:29.620
a very, very small monitor
showing this.

00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:33.690
And in terms of arc radians,
it's about the same size as

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:36.670
what it would be on a phone
held at arm's length.

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:38.970
I cannot make heads or
tails out of this.

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:40.450
DAN GALPIN: It looks
like [GIBBERISH]

00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:41.450
next to the character.

00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:45.190
And the thing is, it would be
fine at that size if there was

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:46.220
more contrast.

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:49.110
But right now, with the amount
of contrast there is between

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:51.810
the Space Ball logo and the
back, it's actually very, very

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:52.550
difficult to read.

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:54.400
IAN NI-LEWIS: Remember, the
weirder your font, the lower

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:57.430
your contrast, the bigger
it needs to be

00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:58.560
in order to be legible.

00:26:58.560 --> 00:26:58.860
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:01.690
And it's such a great logo, I
would really like to see that.

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:05.080
I'd like to see just a little
bit more contrast between the

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:06.190
text and the background.

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:08.740
Other than that, this icon, by
the way, wins the icon award

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:09.200
of the week.

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:12.130
As I said earlier, this
is what an Android

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:13.830
icon should look like.

00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:16.060
Other game developers,
take note.

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:16.520
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right?

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:17.140
DAN GALPIN: Seriously.

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:18.610
IAN NI-LEWIS: Now move
on so I can see your

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:19.180
beautiful face there.

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:20.480
DAN GALPIN: Other game
developers take note.

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.990
There we are.

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:25.000
IAN NI-LEWIS: Otherwise he's
going to mess you up.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:25.790
Look at him.

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:27.110
He's from the hood.

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:28.830
That's why he's got a hoodie.

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:31.340
DAN GALPIN: Absolutely,
with an antenna on it.

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:32.950
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh, dude-- can
we both do it like this?

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:34.750
DAN GALPIN: Yeah!

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:37.140
Actually, it kind of
fits for this game.

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:39.270
So this game's got a little--

00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:40.040
IAN NI-LEWIS: OK, I'm
that dude from

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:41.230
Assassin's Creed now.

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:43.010
DAN GALPIN: Oh, you
totally are, man.

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:44.780
You're from the future.

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:46.030
IAN NI-LEWIS: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:49.360
DAN GALPIN: And this
isn't even your

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:50.490
Assassin's Creed hoodie.

00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:51.510
IAN NI-LEWIS: No, it's not.

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:53.800
I do have an Assassin's Creed
hoodie, but it's not nearly as

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.790
good for playing Assassin's
Creed.

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:56.550
DAN GALPIN: Exactly.

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:58.380
IAN NI-LEWIS: OK, Space Ball.

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:01.210
DAN GALPIN: So Space Ball
is a shooting game.

00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:04.040
And it's actually kind of a
shooting gallery basketball

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:05.740
game, which I thought
was really cool.

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:06.880
IAN NI-LEWIS: You sound
so disappointed.

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:08.070
It's a shooting game.

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:09.990
DAN GALPIN: It's a basketball
shooting game.

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:11.290
But it's well done.

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:12.830
And it's actually really
different.

00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:14.160
I like the little animations.

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:18.790
There's not a lot of crazy
animation, but they're there.

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:21.970
Your goal is to line up the
shot into the baskets.

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:23.080
IAN NI-LEWIS: You've got
to be kidding me.

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:24.300
Oh my god.

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.960
DAN GALPIN: And you get points
for getting runs.

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.640
You don't want to get them into
those things because you

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:29.930
lose your ball.

00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:32.410
And now I'm screwed because
I lost my ball.

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:34.390
IAN NI-LEWIS: What kind of
highly advanced culture is

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:36.290
responsible for this madness?

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:37.950
DAN GALPIN: I totally
screwed that up.

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:38.650
So then you have to
drop the ball.

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:40.350
And now I've dropped it far away
from him, so I'm screwed.

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:42.000
As far as I know, I
can't get it back.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:42.280
IAN NI-LEWIS: What?

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:43.340
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, I
can't get it back.

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:45.610
IAN NI-LEWIS: What, dude can't
walk over and just get it?

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:46.730
DAN GALPIN: I don't think so.

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:47.040
Maybe you can.

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:47.940
I never figured that out.

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:49.940
IAN NI-LEWIS: How lazy are
you, little purple dude?

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:50.480
DAN GALPIN: I know.

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.170
Well, I was trying to
figure that out.

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:53.210
Maybe if you tilt--

00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:54.030
Oh, you tilt him.

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:54.830
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh!

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:55.820
Look at that.

00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:56.510
DAN GALPIN: Ah, OK.

00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:57.400
There we are.

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.790
IAN NI-LEWIS: Once again,
totally flummoxed by an

00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:00.790
accelerometer.

00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:01.590
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, I know.

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:02.340
I know.

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:04.510
Not to mention, we
lost the HDMI.

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:07.020
By the way, I've decided I hate

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:09.000
micro-HDMI with a passion.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.760
I hope we never put
it in products.

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:13.700
IAN NI-LEWIS: You realize that
consumer connectors are not

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:14.590
meant for this stuff.

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:15.050
DAN GALPIN: I know.

00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:15.480
I know.

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:16.210
I know.

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:19.020
OK, makes the game
way more fun.

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:21.300
I'm sitting here, playing with
this on the desk, being like,

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:23.720
this game seems really
not very dynamic.

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.500
IAN NI-LEWIS: So that's
something--

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:30.390
I'm not going to say that you're
typical, but still,

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:33.360
it's always nice to add a little
bit of discoverability.

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:34.230
DAN GALPIN: Ah!

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:36.125
Die, die, stuck ball.

00:29:36.125 --> 00:29:37.450
Oh, that was cool.

00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:39.090
The stuck ball gave
me a basket.

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:41.830
So anyways, I actually think
the game's really fun.

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:43.800
I would like the accelerometer
mechanic to be a little bit

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:44.330
easier found.

00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:45.550
And I actually don't think
this game needs an

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:47.380
accelerometer.

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:49.760
Games that have accelerometer
where they don't really need

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:51.760
one drive me nuts, as
a general rule.

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:53.485
Now maybe there is a way
to change the controls.

00:29:53.485 --> 00:29:55.450
Maybe I can go back, and
there's a way to say--

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:55.790
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's possible.

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:59.270
I mean, I think you can make the
argument that you need one

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:01.180
hand for shooting and you're
going to be better-- but the

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:03.700
problem is too--

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:04.660
actually, no.

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:06.110
I'm going to rant
for a second.

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:08.540
Here's the problem.

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:11.320
When you're doing accelerometer
stuff, that

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:12.320
takes a hand.

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:14.590
It takes at least one
hand, and it feels

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:15.800
better with two hands.

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:19.290
Now, at the same time, let's say
that you need to touch the

00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:22.020
screen in a specific place.

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:22.880
Impossible.

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:23.530
You know why?

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:25.670
Because you're tilting the
device all over the place.

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:28.020
Do you see how hard I'm trying
not to say the F-word now?

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:32.030
DAN GALPIN: Well, on a tablet,
this game kind of sucks

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:33.220
because of that.

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:37.300
IAN NI-LEWIS: It's one thing
when you have a mechanic where

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:39.310
there's a couple buttons on the
side of the screen that

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:40.560
you can get with your
thumb while

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:43.380
you're twisting it around.

00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:47.630
But if you have to move your
device and do any kind of

00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:50.680
precision touching, that's going
to be frustrating for

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:53.880
most of your users, no matter
what kind of device they have.

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:54.210
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:57.000
And the other thing is, in
general, accelerometer games

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.680
on tablets have to
be really, really

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.350
carefully thought through.

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:05.760
So that would be my only
comment, is if you're going to

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:09.080
do one, first of all, it's
better to have multiple

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.020
control options anyways.

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:13.340
We've already shown that if you
give people the options to

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:14.680
have different controllers,
they'll love you.

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:15.630
If you don't--

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:16.575
oh, man.

00:31:16.575 --> 00:31:18.130
I totally want to get
that 3x score.

00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:19.650
IAN NI-LEWIS: Or even just
simplify your control.

00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:22.710
I mean, do you really have to
control the way this guy runs?

00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:24.960
It's pretty obvious where
he's going to run to.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:26.400
Maybe you should think
about making the

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:27.590
mechanic a little simpler.

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:28.520
DAN GALPIN: Making a
mode where he just

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:29.150
goes and grabs it.

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:30.880
Although it is a nice--
ooh, TNT.

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:31.390
Yeah.

00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:32.580
Oh.

00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:33.830
That was bad.

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:39.490
But I love the different
game modes in the game.

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:42.870
The game is totally cool
in the way it plays.

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:44.780
I actually would like to see
it not use an accelerometer

00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:46.310
because it's just kinda dinky.

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.365
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, it's really

00:31:46.365 --> 00:31:47.350
just the control screen.

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:50.890
The graphics are nice, the
animation's nice, it's got a

00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:53.450
fun mechanic, it's not super
deep, but it's interesting.

00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:54.680
DAN GALPIN: Yeah I want to
see higher-res graphics,

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:55.350
admittedly.

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:57.690
IAN NI-LEWIS: This is the kind
of game I can imagine taking

00:31:57.690 --> 00:32:02.640
to the bar and just making some
bets over and just trash

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:05.330
talking with my friends, oh man,
I bet you can't make this

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:07.100
many baskets, or whatever.

00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:07.430
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:09.260
No, it's totally cool.

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:11.250
I would love to see kind of a
social-- there is social stuff

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:13.050
built into the game.

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:15.690
But I'm sure it can
be taken further.

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:17.720
IAN NI-LEWIS: Actually, I don't
need social stuff built

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:19.950
into the game because
I have friends.

00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:20.550
And we just have--

00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:21.200
I'm lying.

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.225
I don't have any friends.

00:32:22.225 --> 00:32:24.800
DAN GALPIN: I was going
to say, come on, man.

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:28.710
So it does have GREE
built into it.

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:31.180
I don't actually know if it
enables any social modes

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:33.460
because when I see these
things, I'm like,

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:34.710
I don't like fun.

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:40.600
So anyways, Space Ball, I
definitely would like to see

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:41.490
some higher-res graphics.

00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:43.860
It does look really blocky
on a tablet.

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:45.820
And on a phone, it's OK.

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:47.570
But otherwise, the game
does really well.

00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:51.580
It actually, for the most
part, yields to our

00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:52.090
guidelines.

00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:53.950
Except here, where hitting the
back doesn't do anything.

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:56.170
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yields
to our guidelines?

00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:58.090
That is the best way
I've heard--

00:32:58.090 --> 00:33:00.620
it submits to our guidelines.

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:02.360
It becomes our supplicant.

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:03.560
DAN GALPIN: It does!

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:06.460
Meaning that as an Android user,
you're mostly not going

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:07.140
to be annoyed with it.

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:08.480
Now, this is totally annoying.

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:09.520
Come on, GREE.

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:12.070
Make the back key actually do
something useful in your app.

00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:15.020
Seriously, look at this.

00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:16.730
The only time I've seen
the game crash--

00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:17.910
right inside of GREE's stuff.

00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:19.000
What is up with that?

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.840
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's a
perennial problem.

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:25.030
And let's just remind everyone
that although middleware gets

00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:27.580
things wrong all the time,
it's your problem.

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:30.480
If you put middleware in your
game and it screws something

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:34.270
up, and you don't get featured
because of that, don't write

00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:36.590
to us and say, oh, but
it's my middleware.

00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:37.580
Can't I get a free pass?

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:38.330
No, you can't.

00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:40.140
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, middleware
is the one that's grabbing

00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:41.850
everyone's phone numbers and
saving them in an evil

00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:45.460
database so that overlords
can contact you by SMS.

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:47.060
No, man.

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:48.570
It's still your fault.

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:50.020
That's like, I'm sorry.

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:51.690
IAN NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:54.180
And the truth is, our hands
are kind of tied.

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:56.060
We can't take your
middleware out.

00:33:56.060 --> 00:34:00.200
That's your decision, to take
it out or put it in.

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.230
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:02.480
Sorry.

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:06.310
I was hit with a "Gangnam
Style" vibe.

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:06.860
It's been a long week.

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:09.949
IAN NI-LEWIS: And if you choose
to put in middleware

00:34:09.949 --> 00:34:12.790
that doesn't work or does
something wrong, that's just

00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:15.980
as bad as programming a
bug into your game.

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:18.480
All right, so let's go
ahead and take a

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:21.219
look at our live stream.

00:34:21.219 --> 00:34:24.940
Engineer Dan, what are the
people saying out there?

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:26.730
DAN PHAM: We've got a bunch
of different comments.

00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:29.650
But we do have a question
from Owen.

00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:33.900
So Owen's asking, can you guys
try to explain how to scale

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:37.969
some of the art using matrices
for different screen

00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:39.620
resolutions?

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:42.790
DAN GALPIN: So there's a couple
of ways of doing it.

00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:46.810
If you're a view-based game--

00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:47.960
IAN NI-LEWIS: Using canvas?

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:50.199
DAN GALPIN: No, if you're a
view-based game, like one in

00:34:50.199 --> 00:34:52.300
which you are actually using
custom views, you can use

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:55.449
image view, you can use a matrix
associated with that.

00:34:55.449 --> 00:34:57.220
Actually, it's kind of nice.

00:34:57.220 --> 00:35:01.010
We give you a matrix that
actually has multiple

00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:03.700
different kinds of
transformations.

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:05.900
And we actually give you a bunch
of functions to allow

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:07.290
you to create the matrix without
understanding the

00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:08.598
matrix math, which
is kind of cool.

00:35:08.598 --> 00:35:09.590
IAN NI-LEWIS: It's
a 3 by 3 matrix.

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:12.180
And if you don't understand the
matrix math, you'll never

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:13.440
be able to debug it.

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:14.620
DAN GALPIN: Yes, that's true.

00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:16.050
IAN NI-LEWIS: And the functions
don't always work

00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:17.610
the way you think they should.

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:20.810
And the moral of the story
is, learn math.

00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:20.996
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:35:20.996 --> 00:35:24.760
And actually, Ian has a really,
really great code

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.980
sample that he did, which is
part of Android U, which is

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:30.990
his custom view code sample,
which actually goes through

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:33.030
using matrix math to do a bunch
of transformations,

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:35.290
including rotation
and scaling.

00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:41.211
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, that's
somewhat true.

00:35:41.211 --> 00:35:45.130
I had to cut it down a lot
because people said, oh, maybe

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:46.680
it's a little too hard.

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:47.660
DAN GALPIN: Maybe you
shouldn't expect

00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:49.610
people to know math.

00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:51.720
That might have helped.

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:52.830
IAN NI-LEWIS: Ian had a
much better example

00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:56.310
that used more math.

00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:57.930
IAN NI-LEWIS: But the important
thing is, remember

00:35:57.930 --> 00:36:07.010
that a 3 by 3 matrix
encapsulates pretty much any

00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:09.730
mapping between the
2 by 2 spaces.

00:36:09.730 --> 00:36:15.240
So for an XY coordinate system,
in a 3 by 3 matrix,

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:20.070
you can do translation,
rotation, scaling, skewing,

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:21.970
perspectives, et cetera.

00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:26.200
And building that matrix is
something that our functions

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.420
will do for you.

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:31.330
But concatenating multiple
matrices together--

00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:34.620
also something that we'll do,
but you need to understand how

00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:36.855
the math works in order to make
sure that you're doing it

00:36:36.855 --> 00:36:38.050
in the right order.

00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:40.410
Matrix multiplication, unlike
most other types of

00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:42.920
multiplication, is
non-communicative, which can

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:44.830
really trip people up.

00:36:44.830 --> 00:36:48.170
Witness the incorrect math
that was actually--

00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:49.410
DAN GALPIN: In our
OpenGL sample.

00:36:49.410 --> 00:36:52.200
IAN NI-LEWIS: --shipped in our
OpenGL sample, which was a

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:55.700
tricky one because there was not
only bad math, but there

00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:58.500
was a memory overwrite that we
didn't catch, which made it

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:00.940
look like it was good math
for certain conditions.

00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:03.130
DAN GALPIN: It actually looked
like it was doing something

00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:04.405
reasonable, which is
always dangerous.

00:37:04.405 --> 00:37:06.660
IAN NI-LEWIS: Best stack
overflow question ever.

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:09.002
And I have to say, by
the way, Joe and

00:37:09.002 --> 00:37:12.390
I both wrote responses.

00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:13.990
And his was like, oh
yeah, it's wrong.

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:14.540
I'll fix it.

00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:17.300
And mine is like, well,
here's how it's wrong.

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:19.250
Here's the fix, blah,
blah, blah.

00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:22.190
But he mentioned that he was the
guy that wrote the sample,

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:24.310
so his got accepted.

00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:25.220
DAN GALPIN: No way.

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:26.950
IAN NI-LEWIS: I'm still bitter
about that because my stack

00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:30.040
overflow reputation isn't
exactly the best in the world.

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:32.020
You could always
go vote it up.

00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:33.280
DAN GALPIN: Exactly.

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:33.930
He's the man.

00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:35.210
Come on.

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:36.260
He fixed the math.

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:38.270
IAN NI-LEWIS: The main thing is
that, yeah, you're applying

00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:45.780
a scale matrix to your bitmaps
in order to fit them into a

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:47.050
specific place.

00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:50.240
But it seemed like either the
scaling was wrong or it was

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:52.910
being applied in the wrong
order because as you're

00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:56.150
rotating things, they were being
scaled way out beyond

00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:57.870
the bounds of where we thought
they should be.

00:37:57.870 --> 00:38:01.220
I don't know if that helps
answer your question.

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:04.330
If not, then sign on to Office
Hours on Wednesday.

00:38:04.330 --> 00:38:06.340
You can ask up live.

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:08.760
DAN GALPIN: And one more thing
I'd like to add is that it's

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:11.880
really important, since the
matrix can do all those

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:14.460
transformations, use the
matrix for all of them.

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:16.430
Don't try to say, well, I'm
going to put this thing in a

00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:18.340
surface view, and then I'm going
to try to set a scale

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:19.580
factor somewhere else.

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:21.050
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]
is important.

00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:22.570
DAN GALPIN: Rely on the matrix
to do everything.

00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:25.340
One, it's really fast.

00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:28.280
And two, it actually will make
your code a lot simpler.

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:29.360
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, you've
got to remember, too,

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:30.975
what's going on here.

00:38:30.975 --> 00:38:32.650
DAN GALPIN: I'm telling people
to rely on the matrix.

00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:35.100
I feel like I'm in a movie
or something like that.

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:36.090
IAN NI-LEWIS: Dude,
you're so old.

00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:38.100
DAN GALPIN: I know.

00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:42.540
IAN NI-LEWIS: So the thing is,
remember that obviously for

00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:44.070
software rendering, this
doesn't matter.

00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:49.070
But for hardware rendering,
anything that's done using the

00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:53.530
matrix will be done
by the GPU.

00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:55.375
I'm sure there are some
exceptions to that.

00:38:55.375 --> 00:38:56.600
But that's a general rule.

00:38:56.600 --> 00:39:00.470
Whereas if you do something
without using the matrix, it's

00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:01.080
a bit of a crap shoot.

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:02.980
You don't know if you're
going to get it or not.

00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:05.340
Now, there are some things you
need to be careful of.

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:09.370
For instance, let's say that you
draw a path and then scale

00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:10.490
it using the matrix.

00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:13.660
That will be very fast, but
the quality will be low

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:17.250
because GPUs aren't very good
at drawing paths, so we draw

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:21.210
the path in software and then
scale it up or scale it down.

00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:24.190
Which means one of my favorite
things to do in the old

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:28.370
system, which was to always draw
paths in a 1 by 1 box and

00:39:28.370 --> 00:39:29.620
then scale it to whatever--

00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:29.880
no.

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:30.285
DAN GALPIN: Bad.

00:39:30.285 --> 00:39:30.830
IAN NI-LEWIS: Don't do that.

00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:32.880
That would be a sad thing.

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:35.200
But for things that are
already drawn--

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:39.980
bit maps, text, especially--

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:45.650
things that can be scaled and
rotated by the hardware, make

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:46.990
sure that you do that.

00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:49.470
Of course, it's a little bit
more complicated than just

00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:51.800
using the canvas matrices.

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:54.350
You also have to make sure
that you're in a layer.

00:39:54.350 --> 00:39:59.450
And my class on doing
custom controls,

00:39:59.450 --> 00:40:04.030
developer.android.com/training,
I think.

00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:06.150
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, that
sounds right.

00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:08.300
IAN NI-LEWIS: Anyway, I have
a class on doing custom

00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:11.780
controls, and it explains how
to draw something to a layer

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:14.110
so that you can very quickly
rotate it and get

00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:16.580
buttery-smooth graphics, even
though the operation that

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:17.600
you're doing is kind
of expensive.

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:19.140
DAN GALPIN: And the other guys
you should look at as class

00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:23.380
actually are the guys who
did the Metro Rush game.

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:27.570
Because his custom control
actually talks about physics,

00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:29.820
and he actually has some
very, very nice

00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:30.920
fling physics in that.

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:33.300
And I think that would help
the game out immensely.

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:37.870
And you can actually use the
built-in physics model you get

00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:43.440
with our gesture detector
to do a lot of that.

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.000
IAN NI-LEWIS: And the other
people who should look at my

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.023
class is everybody.

00:40:47.023 --> 00:40:48.255
Because I need the page views.

00:40:48.255 --> 00:40:48.740
Come on.

00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:49.030
Come on.

00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:49.420
DAN GALPIN: It's true.

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:53.000
IAN NI-LEWIS: Daddy needs a new
Tesla Model S. All right.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.180
DAN GALPIN: We need to
get him promoted.

00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:55.430
It's very important.

00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:58.430
IAN NI-LEWIS: All right, so--

00:40:58.430 --> 00:41:00.130
DAN GALPIN: Anything else
in the live stream?

00:41:00.130 --> 00:41:01.610
DAN PHAM: Yeah.

00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:04.370
IAN NI-LEWIS: Pham's like, hey,
there's some comments.

00:41:04.370 --> 00:41:07.230
Oh, and here's something I'm
actually going to read too.

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:09.760
DAN GALPIN: Here's what we can
actually read on the air.

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:12.170
DAN PHAM: I'm not exactly sure
if you guys answered Owen's

00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:17.830
question yet, but he posted a
little bit of an explanation.

00:41:17.830 --> 00:41:19.150
IAN NI-LEWIS: We answered
it poorly.

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:19.990
DAN PHAM: Yeah.

00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:21.220
DAN GALPIN: I blame the stout.

00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:24.190
DAN PHAM: So specifically,
he says--

00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:24.550
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:26.960
We don't know exactly what they
did wrong in the domino

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:27.955
game is the problem.

00:41:27.955 --> 00:41:28.600
Anyway--

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:31.300
DAN PHAM: So he's saying, say
you design your vector art in

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:32.980
480 by 800 res.

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:35.500
Now you want to have support
for a large screen, HDPI

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:38.780
phone, say 1,200 by 600
resolution, he's looking for

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:41.270
technical details on
how to scale that.

00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:42.688
I'm not sure if you guys
addressed that in your

00:41:42.688 --> 00:41:42.780
explanation.

00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:45.480
DAN GALPIN: OK, so there's
two different things.

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:49.990
If you're vector art, you're
importing it as a bitmap--

00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:51.960
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, that's one
really important thing.

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:54.860
Are you doing it as vector,
or are you--

00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:56.160
DAN GALPIN: No, he
said bitmap.

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:57.480
IAN NI-LEWIS: So he's going
to author that.

00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:58.200
Yeah

00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:00.000
DAN GALPIN: So in general--

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.830
yeah, so in general, if you can
actually display vector

00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:08.000
art in your game, then what
we generally recommend is

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.370
exporting a relatively high
quality version of it and

00:42:11.370 --> 00:42:14.140
putting it in a higher density
to start with.

00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:19.140
That helps the phones like the
Galaxy Nexus that are hxdpi

00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:20.110
because you'll end up getting

00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:22.180
high-resolution artwork on there.

00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:24.890
Now, the bigger question
is how do I do the

00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:26.900
same thing on a tablet?

00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:30.100
There's a couple of different
ways of doing that.

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:31.680
One way you can do things--

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:33.260
and this is fairly
straightforward--

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:38.610
you can actually throw the
artwork into a nodpi folder

00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:42.660
and you can just try
to select a scale

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:43.700
factor that makes sense.

00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:45.650
Don't rely on the system
to scale it at all.

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:50.490
Then you run into one other
problem on the very low-end

00:42:50.490 --> 00:42:52.620
devices with memory.

00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:54.410
Because you're going to be
loading in, potentially, a

00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:57.150
much larger set of bitmaps than
it's designed to take,

00:42:57.150 --> 00:43:00.680
which is part of the reason why
we do all the DPI-based

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:01.920
loading that we do.

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:02.210
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:06.675
You want to try and load
whatever is as close to your

00:43:06.675 --> 00:43:07.830
DPI as possible.

00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:10.710
And the system's going
to take care of that.

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:14.110
So let me try and break down
what we were talking about

00:43:14.110 --> 00:43:17.100
matrices because Dan says matrix
any time he wants to

00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:17.880
sound smart.

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:20.640
So here's what we're
going to do.

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:22.500
All you're going to do
is scale this stuff.

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:25.710
But the important thing is
there's really two ways to

00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:27.320
scale a bitmap in Android.

00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:30.950
You can use a draw bitmap and
give it a destination rect

00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:33.070
that's different from your
source rect, and

00:43:33.070 --> 00:43:34.360
that will do scaling.

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:39.470
Or you can draw it to a canvas
at its original rectangle and

00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:42.010
apply a scale matrix to
the entire canvas.

00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:47.610
And the problem comes when you
mix them, so when you mix the

00:43:47.610 --> 00:43:48.430
two techniques.

00:43:48.430 --> 00:43:51.670
Well no, because applying the
scale matrix to the canvas is

00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:53.070
applying it to each
drawing operating.

00:43:53.070 --> 00:43:54.240
It's not a full scale.

00:43:54.240 --> 00:44:00.120
So what we were suggesting is
that you pick the canvas size

00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:04.840
that you feel is native, so
whatever you had in mind.

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:08.600
Now remember, this isn't going
to take care of aspect ratio,

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:10.250
it's going to take
care of size.

00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:12.010
Now, for aspect ratio,
you need to

00:44:12.010 --> 00:44:17.020
make some other decisions.

00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:19.150
You may want to do a little
bit of [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:23.645
move some of your UI elements
out further or

00:44:23.645 --> 00:44:24.380
something like that.

00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:26.290
And the other thing that's a
little tricky is on a tablet--

00:44:26.290 --> 00:44:29.550
so normally what Android does is
if you have, let's say, an

00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:33.620
xhdpi resource, and you try to
load it onto a tablet, which

00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:36.530
is an MDPI device, Android's
automatically going to go

00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:38.540
[SQUISH], and it's going
to squish that down.

00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:41.390
And it's going to make an MDPI
size because its goal is it's

00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:47.520
trying through to retain the
physical size of that bitmap,

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:50.950
which for a lot of actual
non-game UI is very nice.

00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:52.970
Because what you really want
a tablet, often, is just to

00:44:52.970 --> 00:44:54.970
display more information.

00:44:54.970 --> 00:44:56.680
However, there's a balance.

00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:58.100
So what you can do is
a couple of things.

00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:01.370
One is you can actually say,
when I'm on an extra-large

00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:05.040
device, let's not use the DPI
that is built into it.

00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:07.610
You can actually say, I'm on an
extra-large screen device,

00:45:07.610 --> 00:45:10.500
I'm going to make use of higher
resolution assets.

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:13.040
And you can actually set that
and tell the resource loader

00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:16.470
actually, go load me
the next level up.

00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:18.470
The other thing you can do is,
if you're going to do that a

00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:22.760
lot, you can simply store your
resources in a no-DPI folder

00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:25.210
and then do some calculations
yourself to

00:45:25.210 --> 00:45:26.130
determine how to scale.

00:45:26.130 --> 00:45:29.260
Because actually, if you look
at what's going on inside of

00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:31.710
the resource loader, all it's
doing is it's telling the

00:45:31.710 --> 00:45:33.340
bitmap factory to scale.

00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:35.440
Now, one thing that's kind of
nice that you can also do-- if

00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:36.990
you want to do it a little
bit more optimally--

00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:39.540
is that there's actually two
ways in which, on loading, you

00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:40.530
can scale bitmaps.

00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:42.520
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, but the
thing is, I think when we were

00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:44.300
talking about the dominoes--
and this is why I was going

00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:46.270
with the matrix direction--

00:45:46.270 --> 00:45:48.660
I feel like we're sort of
diverging into two different

00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:49.480
stories here.

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:52.631
But the problem was not that--

00:45:52.631 --> 00:45:54.510
I mean, I'm sure he was loading
the wrong resource,

00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:56.590
but it felt like the real
problem was he was drawing the

00:45:56.590 --> 00:46:01.820
dominoes with one set of scale
factors and he was using--

00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:02.510
DAN GALPIN: Yes, drawing
the dots with another

00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:03.270
set of scale factors.

00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:04.060
IAN NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:06.170
DAN GALPIN: And the other thing
is that the dominoes are

00:46:06.170 --> 00:46:06.610
very, very--

00:46:06.610 --> 00:46:09.440
IAN NI-LEWIS: So we've got the
DPI thing, we've got the

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:10.890
matrix thing-- let's
separate those and

00:46:10.890 --> 00:46:11.340
finish one or the other.

00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:13.060
So you talk about
the DPI thing.

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:17.140
DAN GALPIN: So for DPI, you've
got two problems that are

00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:17.720
fighting each other.

00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:19.780
You want to make sure that you
make video memory still work

00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:22.280
on devices that have limited
video memory.

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:25.530
So where it makes sense to
do what is going with the

00:46:25.530 --> 00:46:28.385
standard transformations, it
does make sense to use them or

00:46:28.385 --> 00:46:30.780
to simply apply similar
ones yourself.

00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:33.160
The second thing is that you
really want to make sure that

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:35.260
on a tablet, if you want to
display things bigger, that

00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:38.740
you do select larger
resolution assets.

00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:41.950
And the easiest thing to do is
simply to enumerate the kind

00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:43.940
of assets you have and
select the right one.

00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:46.490
That's what a lot of
game developers do.

00:46:46.490 --> 00:46:48.800
IAN NI-LEWIS: Now, if you do the
DPI thing too, if you're

00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:51.790
in the DPI folders, you can
basically work in DIPs, right?

00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:53.740
You don't have to work
in actual pixels?

00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:54.260
DAN GALPIN: That's correct.

00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:55.700
Your can do all of your
layouts in DIPs.

00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:58.000
The only problem with that is
obviously this thing has a

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.540
much larger amount of DIPs.

00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:02.500
And so you're going to
actually want to have

00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:03.250
different resources.

00:47:03.250 --> 00:47:04.710
People don't want to have

00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:07.160
HDPI-slash-extra large resources.

00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:10.240
That's actually the correct way
of having different scaled

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:13.300
resources, is to actually have
separate bitmaps that are for

00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:16.840
tablets for HDPI and for
phones for HDPI.

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:19.490
And that just gets
kind of messy.

00:47:19.490 --> 00:47:23.860
So in this case, in order to
keep the image really small,

00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:25.420
in order to keep things
relatively simple, you'll

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:27.460
probably want to do a little bit
of math just to make sure

00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:30.430
you get the right size images
with the highest quality

00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:32.880
available for these
MDBI tablets.

00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:33.140
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:36.690
So let's move on
to that, then.

00:47:36.690 --> 00:47:38.270
Especially if you're
thinking in DIPs.

00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:42.360
So DIPs are supposed to be
related to physical units.

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:43.670
DAN GALPIN: And they
are, actually.

00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:44.120
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:45.450
Well--

00:47:45.450 --> 00:47:45.540
yes.

00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:47.080
DAN GALPIN: They're related.

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:49.880
They're not exactly related.

00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:53.270
IAN NI-LEWIS: So the trick here
is that a 4-inch phone

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:55.760
and a 10-inch tablet may
actually have the same number

00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:57.830
of pixels but a different
number of DIPs.

00:47:57.830 --> 00:48:00.660
So I think what we're suggesting
is that you might

00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:07.010
want to go ahead and decide on
a native dimensions in DIPs

00:48:07.010 --> 00:48:11.410
and then either expand
or contract by

00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:12.370
setting a scale factor.

00:48:12.370 --> 00:48:13.770
Now, how do you set
that scale factor?

00:48:13.770 --> 00:48:16.590
Well, you do it in the matrix
of your canvas.

00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:20.450
And you make sure that for all
of the elements that are

00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:23.680
supposed to be occupying the
same physical space in your

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:26.500
game board, that matrix
needs to be the same.

00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:32.310
And the domino game is probably
using one matrix for

00:48:32.310 --> 00:48:35.750
drawing the triangles and
using another matrix for

00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:36.480
drawing the dots.

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:38.280
And that's where they're
running into problems.

00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:38.520
DAN GALPIN: I think so.

00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:39.580
I think that's exactly
what's going on.

00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:43.250
I think actually, it's probably
drawing the triangles

00:48:43.250 --> 00:48:47.450
as based just purely on what's
coming on the screen.

00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:51.140
And it's probably loading the
bitmap images and making

00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:52.690
assumptions about the size
of them and then

00:48:52.690 --> 00:48:54.080
trying to scale those.

00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:55.700
That's my guess.

00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:59.410
We even saw on Galaxy Nexus with
that game that even going

00:48:59.410 --> 00:49:02.260
to HDMI and plugging that in
made the game unplayable.

00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:04.470
So there's probably some
calculations going on that are

00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:06.990
based on the display size rather
than on the viewport

00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:08.630
size it's given as well.

00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:10.660
So there's probably a number
of different issues.

00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:13.252
You have to really make sure
that when the system tells you

00:49:13.252 --> 00:49:15.640
no, rescale your viewport, you
really have to go and redo

00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:16.630
those calculations.

00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:18.720
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, and that's
very important as well.

00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:21.120
So you have to remember that
you're going to be on a

00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:22.570
multitude of different
devices.

00:49:22.570 --> 00:49:26.080
And this is actually where 3D
games have a real advantage

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:31.060
because 3D games are used to
having to do viewport mapping,

00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:36.180
mapping from your 3D world, into
what we call clip space.

00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:39.260
But 2D games, a lot of times,
haven't had to deal with that

00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:42.790
unless you're coming from a
background of games that were

00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:45.690
actually written to be resized
on, let's say, a desktop PC.

00:49:45.690 --> 00:49:45.920
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:48.290
And there's no reason why a game
like dominoes shouldn't

00:49:48.290 --> 00:49:50.720
be resizable and scalable.

00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:53.060
And there's a lot of ways
to attack that.

00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:56.830
So I think maybe that
helps a little bit.

00:49:56.830 --> 00:49:59.720
IAN NI-LEWIS: And if not,
drop something on

00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:01.500
Stack Overflow, and--

00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:02.460
DAN GALPIN: Ian'll get
some more points.

00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:03.280
IAN NI-LEWIS: --ping
us through G+.

00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:05.160
And yeah, totally, we'll
do the work.

00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:06.760
DAN GALPIN: Ian needs
some more reps.

00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:07.020
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh, yeah.

00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:08.140
DAN GALPIN: So he'll be there.

00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:08.800
IAN NI-LEWIS: Big time.

00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:09.860
DAN GALPIN: And so
do I, actually.

00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:12.570
IAN NI-LEWIS: Anything
else on the internet?

00:50:12.570 --> 00:50:14.800
DAN PHAM: Yeah, so this
is the last question.

00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:17.300
One of our users wants to know
if we have any guidelines on

00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:20.200
dealing with performance
variety between devices

00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:22.940
because the filtering only
handles GPU and screen size.

00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:24.180
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's is
the billion-dollar

00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:25.050
question, isn't it?

00:50:25.050 --> 00:50:27.810
DAN GALPIN: So yeah, actually,
it doesn't really handle GPU.

00:50:27.810 --> 00:50:30.390
It handles OpenGL ES version.

00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:32.480
And it doesn't really--

00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:33.040
IAN NI-LEWIS: It handles
texture format.

00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:33.590
DAN GALPIN: It handles
texture format.

00:50:33.590 --> 00:50:37.740
IAN NI-LEWIS: Which is a sort
of proxy for GPU but not a

00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:38.680
very good one.

00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:41.710
DAN GALPIN: So today, there's
two low-hanging fruit

00:50:41.710 --> 00:50:42.410
that you can use.

00:50:42.410 --> 00:50:44.500
One is, of course, you can say
whether or not you're actually

00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:46.400
using OpenGL ES 2.0.

00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:47.950
Check that.

00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:50.480
And make sure that you're
actually filtering

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:52.190
on OpenGL ES 2.0.

00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:53.520
The second thing you can do--

00:50:57.980 --> 00:51:01.810
this is sort of a bad option for
a lot of games if you're

00:51:01.810 --> 00:51:02.900
only using DOLVIC.

00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:05.750
But the vast majority of
performance-bound games are

00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:07.590
actually using NDK.

00:51:07.590 --> 00:51:12.100
So make sure to only build an
ARMv7-A binary and/or MIPS and

00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:12.860
Intel binary.

00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:14.770
Don't target ARMv5.

00:51:14.770 --> 00:51:18.230
You'll eliminate a lot of
low-end devices that way.

00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:21.170
All right, but now you're in
the issue of, I've got this

00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:24.050
super, super, super
high-performance title that I

00:51:24.050 --> 00:51:26.910
know can only target the
top 10% of devices.

00:51:26.910 --> 00:51:30.050
Galaxy S3s, Galaxy S2s.

00:51:30.050 --> 00:51:32.700
And if you're in that position,
there's nothing you

00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:36.300
can do other than to go through
and eliminate those

00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:38.010
devices based upon our
compatibility list.

00:51:38.010 --> 00:51:40.740
IAN NI-LEWIS: And let's talk
a little bit about

00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:43.290
why this is an issue.

00:51:43.290 --> 00:51:46.940
Remember that Android isn't
unique in this.

00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:48.880
I mean, in the desktop
space, this is

00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:50.470
actually pretty normal.

00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:54.250
But Android does have, actually,
a couple more GPU

00:51:54.250 --> 00:51:57.770
vendors than what you'd find in
the general desktop space.

00:51:57.770 --> 00:52:01.280
And we often get the question,
well, why don't we just

00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:03.700
publish some statistics like,
what's the fill rate?

00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:04.980
Well, there's some
problems there.

00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:08.010
First off, everybody lies.

00:52:08.010 --> 00:52:12.200
And those who aren't lying are
only not lying because they're

00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:13.820
bad at something else.

00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:16.250
So you can talk about fill rate
and you can talk about

00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:17.600
polygon throughput.

00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:19.430
You can talk about raw
vertex shader.

00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:20.870
You can talk about
memory bandwidth.

00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:26.640
But the truth is, on a GPU,
all of these things add up

00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:30.750
into something that's even only
partially the picture.

00:52:30.750 --> 00:52:34.220
Because not only do you have
different bandwidths and

00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:37.820
different fill rates and
different arithmetic unit

00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:40.720
designs, you also have
completely different

00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:45.470
architectures, the main ones
being tiled or immediate mode.

00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:46.540
DAN GALPIN: And there's
actually two things.

00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:49.170
There's tiled deferred mode
and then there's tiled

00:52:49.170 --> 00:52:50.035
immediate mode.

00:52:50.035 --> 00:52:51.860
IAN NI-LEWIS: Which
is sort of a--

00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:52.390
yeah.

00:52:52.390 --> 00:52:55.550
DAN GALPIN: And so basically,
the question you have to ask

00:52:55.550 --> 00:52:58.990
yourself is one, how
many devices--

00:52:58.990 --> 00:53:01.920
IAN NI-LEWIS: Dude, you so
passed up an opportunity.

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:02.900
DAN GALPIN: Yeah?

00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:05.450
IAN NI-LEWIS: The question you
have to ask yourself is, do

00:53:05.450 --> 00:53:06.650
you feel lucky, punk?

00:53:06.650 --> 00:53:07.450
DAN GALPIN: Exactly.

00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:08.280
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, do ya?

00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:09.370
DAN GALPIN: So how many
devices do you

00:53:09.370 --> 00:53:11.100
really want to hit?

00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:14.890
Today, I think you're going to
want to hit a pretty large

00:53:14.890 --> 00:53:15.870
cross-section of devices.

00:53:15.870 --> 00:53:17.620
But you might be limited
because of memory.

00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:21.550
You might be limited because
of just raw GPU power.

00:53:21.550 --> 00:53:24.510
Today on Google Play, if you're
really limited by those

00:53:24.510 --> 00:53:27.570
things-- and my advice to
everyone is try to target as

00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:29.780
broad as possible.

00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:33.740
If you're running a 3D game,
you're going to have a mipmap

00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:36.020
with different versions of a
texture for things that are in

00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:37.670
the distance, typically.

00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:40.110
Take advantage of that and use
different mipmap levels.

00:53:40.110 --> 00:53:41.762
IAN NI-LEWIS: Do you want
to use a MIP bias to--

00:53:41.762 --> 00:53:44.360
OK, I can see that.

00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:46.740
I will say, I don't think
there's anybody that's

00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:48.520
terrible at vertex
performance.

00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:55.410
So you want to have a certain
number of vertices, and you

00:53:55.410 --> 00:53:59.210
can cut off this year's or
last year's devices.

00:53:59.210 --> 00:54:01.070
I don't actually think there's
even been that

00:54:01.070 --> 00:54:02.300
much progress in this.

00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:06.480
But fill rate-wise, what's
the right thing to do?

00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:08.880
Well, Dan's got a good idea.

00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:14.660
If you're bound by input,
doing a MIP bias would

00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:16.710
definitely reduce the amount of

00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:18.230
memory the GPU is consuming.

00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:22.230
It doesn't reduce the amount the
GPU is producing, which is

00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:24.600
where you would reduce your
frame buffer size.

00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:28.120
DAN GALPIN: So the second thing
you can do, and a lot of

00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:30.450
developers don't do this, and I
think it's partially because

00:54:30.450 --> 00:54:31.800
they don't know.

00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:32.680
It's kind of hidden.

00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:34.640
But one thing that you, as a
developer, can do if you're

00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:40.470
using OpenGL, is you can
actually set the size of your

00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:44.455
viewport in our windowing
system, so not even in OpenGL.

00:54:44.455 --> 00:54:47.340
And we actually offer this sort
of hidden API which is

00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:51.420
inside of Surface Holder
called Set Fixed Size.

00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:54.670
And if you do that, it'll
actually automatically scale

00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:58.015
your viewport up to the
size of your window.

00:54:58.015 --> 00:55:00.030
So it's actually very,
very useful.

00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:04.490
And that's done inside of
SurfaceFlinger, and it may

00:55:04.490 --> 00:55:06.480
even be done with a
hardware composer.

00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:09.930
So for a lot of reasons, we
definitely recommend doing

00:55:09.930 --> 00:55:14.390
that, especially if your choices
are rendering to a

00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:18.500
pixel buffer or actually
rendering to using this, you

00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:19.170
should definitely use this.

00:55:19.170 --> 00:55:20.660
You're going to get
more performance.

00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:22.910
A lot of times when things are
really just heavily fill

00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:24.450
limited, that's what
you should do.

00:55:24.450 --> 00:55:25.690
Obviously, there's
shader effects.

00:55:25.690 --> 00:55:26.560
There's other things
you can do.

00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:28.760
But my general advice
on Android is, try

00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:29.870
to make things scalable.

00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:34.240
Try not to cut off users if you
absolutely can avoid it.

00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:36.350
You want as many users as
possible to see your game.

00:55:36.350 --> 00:55:38.820
IAN NI-LEWIS: Give yourself
some knobs so you can make

00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:39.790
adjustments.

00:55:39.790 --> 00:55:43.650
Don't necessarily expose
us to the users.

00:55:43.650 --> 00:55:45.690
DAN GALPIN: Well, one of my
favorite games that does this

00:55:45.690 --> 00:55:46.660
is Dead Trigger.

00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:48.520
I mean, Dead Trigger
has a slider.

00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:51.450
And with a lot of GPUs,
it'll [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:51.450 --> 00:55:53.860
It'll say, you're guaranteed
to work at the

00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:54.810
lowest quality only.

00:55:54.810 --> 00:55:57.650
But you can slide it over, and
you can, say, turn on effects.

00:55:57.650 --> 00:55:58.440
And you can see what happens.

00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:01.130
And sometimes it may just
crash the game when you

00:56:01.130 --> 00:56:03.320
actually try to run the game
with everything turned on.

00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:05.700
But at least the user knows,
I turned on those effects.

00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:06.820
It's crashing.

00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:08.020
That's not good for
every developer.

00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:10.070
Some developers are like, I
don't want users to ever see

00:56:10.070 --> 00:56:11.760
my title crash.

00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:14.650
I much prefer being given the
option of saying, let's try

00:56:14.650 --> 00:56:16.680
turning it up and see
what happens.

00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:18.120
And they do a whole bunch
of techniques--

00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:21.100
they actually don't even use
resolution in that slider.

00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:22.500
They're simply turning
off effects.

00:56:25.455 --> 00:56:27.170
It's almost all turning
off, actually.

00:56:27.170 --> 00:56:28.466
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, remember
the things that

00:56:28.466 --> 00:56:28.610
are going to be--

00:56:28.610 --> 00:56:29.850
And texture quality.

00:56:29.850 --> 00:56:32.810
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, texture
fetches are

00:56:32.810 --> 00:56:35.570
going to be a big deal.

00:56:35.570 --> 00:56:37.280
On many GPs, especially
[INAUDIBLE]

00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:39.780
Tyler's, state changes are
going to be a big deal.

00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:41.630
On Ford renderers--

00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:44.400
Tegra is the best example
of this--

00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:47.230
your geometry sorting is
going to be a big deal.

00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:49.880
DAN GALPIN: You want to take
advantage of early Z

00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:50.880
rejection on Tegra.

00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:52.090
It's absolutely critical.

00:56:52.090 --> 00:56:56.220
The number of games we look at
that draw in the reverse order

00:56:56.220 --> 00:56:59.250
and end up getting really slow
performance, people are like,

00:56:59.250 --> 00:57:00.990
wow, this game is amazing
on Nexus 7.

00:57:00.990 --> 00:57:02.690
They look at the next game,
they say, well,

00:57:02.690 --> 00:57:03.980
this isn't very good.

00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:10.330
And the reason why, often,
there's kind of two things--

00:57:10.330 --> 00:57:13.450
design artwork, and also make
sure that they're doing draw

00:57:13.450 --> 00:57:16.130
order that allows for early Z to
really take best advantage

00:57:16.130 --> 00:57:17.010
of the hardware.

00:57:17.010 --> 00:57:20.010
IAN NI-LEWIS: Now, remember
that all of the GPU

00:57:20.010 --> 00:57:23.630
manufactures want games
to look great on

00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:25.470
their particular chipset.

00:57:25.470 --> 00:57:29.380
And they all have armies of
people that want to help games

00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:31.340
look better on that chipset.

00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:34.730
So if you're having specific
problems, contact Invidia,

00:57:34.730 --> 00:57:39.180
contact Qualcomm, contact
imagination Technologies.

00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:39.860
DAN GALPIN: Contact ARM.

00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:41.460
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah,
contact ARM--

00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:43.810
any of these.

00:57:43.810 --> 00:57:46.360
And get some help because a
lot of times, it's just a

00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:49.640
matter of rewriting a
shader or changing

00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:50.930
your draw order around.

00:57:50.930 --> 00:57:54.080
And don't forget, all of them
have really great tools for

00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:58.250
investigating what your
draw calls are doing.

00:57:58.250 --> 00:57:59.230
DAN GALPIN: I mean,
PerfHUD, the

00:57:59.230 --> 00:58:03.140
Adreno Profiler, PVRTrace--

00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:05.080
all of these tools are really,
really helpful.

00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:07.390
And the best part for me, the
exciting part, is that a lot

00:58:07.390 --> 00:58:09.230
of them now work on non-rooted
devices.

00:58:09.230 --> 00:58:12.680
So even your consumer devices,
you can plug them right in.

00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:15.450
PerfHUD works that way, Adreno
Profiler works that way.

00:58:15.450 --> 00:58:18.450
PVRTune is slowly
getting there.

00:58:18.450 --> 00:58:22.750
I mean, the thing with PVR is
that you'll run into weird,

00:58:22.750 --> 00:58:25.670
goofy performance bugs with
PVR-- like, things that you

00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:28.520
just don't expect because it
does all of these crazy

00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:29.530
optimizations for you.

00:58:29.530 --> 00:58:32.990
And you do one thing that trips
it up and says, oh crap,

00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:35.100
I have to render
everything now.

00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:36.690
And all of a sudden, your
performance cliffs.

00:58:36.690 --> 00:58:39.300
IAN NI-LEWIS: I definitely
wouldn't limit that to PVR.

00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:39.615
DAN GALPIN: No.

00:58:39.615 --> 00:58:40.220
IAN NI-LEWIS: Everybody
does that.

00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:41.130
DAN GALPIN: Everyone
does that.

00:58:41.130 --> 00:58:44.040
But PVR, because it does so many
optimizations, you may be

00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:47.120
shocked that one little
operation you do causes things

00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:49.470
to suddenly slow down by
orders of magnitude.

00:58:49.470 --> 00:58:50.500
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:52.730
Well, remember Wind-up Knight
and they fell over the

00:58:52.730 --> 00:58:54.280
performance cliff--

00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:55.010
DAN GALPIN: Exactly--

00:58:55.010 --> 00:58:56.060
on ARM Mali.

00:58:56.060 --> 00:58:58.160
That was the driver bug in
that particular case.

00:58:58.160 --> 00:58:59.400
IAN NI-LEWIS: You never know
what's going to happen.

00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:01.340
All of these are different.

00:59:01.340 --> 00:59:01.453
DAN GALPIN: Absolutely.

00:59:01.453 --> 00:59:03.390
Where large VBOs, which normally
help performance,

00:59:03.390 --> 00:59:04.020
actually hurt them.

00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:05.130
So yeah, absolutely.

00:59:05.130 --> 00:59:07.350
IAN NI-LEWIS: So there are some
general best practices,

00:59:07.350 --> 00:59:10.870
but if you really, really want
to push the envelope, then you

00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:14.560
need to actually purchase some
of these units, talk to the

00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:19.140
manufacturers, and tune
for each type of GPU.

00:59:19.140 --> 00:59:21.070
But remember, there's
not that many.

00:59:21.070 --> 00:59:24.340
There's the Tegra series,
the Adreno, the ARM

00:59:24.340 --> 00:59:27.780
Mali, and the PVR.

00:59:27.780 --> 00:59:30.560
There are a couple others,
but we don't--

00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:32.770
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, those are
the ones that have volume.

00:59:32.770 --> 00:59:33.580
Certainly, you also--

00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:34.720
IAN NI-LEWIS: In terms
of gaming.

00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:35.360
DAN GALPIN: In terms
of gaming volume.

00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:39.160
I mean, certainly you can go and
grab Broadcom devices, the

00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:40.780
Galaxy Y uses that.

00:59:40.780 --> 00:59:43.520
You can grab a Raspberry Pie
if you want to play with a

00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:45.150
Broadcom device.

00:59:45.150 --> 00:59:49.580
And then there's also some
devices that are now using the

00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:52.560
Marvell, which is the
Vivante Accelerator.

00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:54.960
The new CoStar from
Vizio uses that.

00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:59.230
So there are a few, but again,
the vast majority of your

00:59:59.230 --> 01:00:00.820
phones and tablets that are
out there with the others.

01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:03.590
IAN NI-LEWIS: We love all of our
devices here at Android,

01:00:03.590 --> 01:00:05.340
but there are a few that
are made for gaming

01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:06.125
and some that aren't.

01:00:06.125 --> 01:00:09.560
So the top four you really
need to look at.

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:11.920
The others, it depends
on how broad you want

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:12.750
your audience to be.

01:00:12.750 --> 01:00:13.730
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, absolutely.

01:00:13.730 --> 01:00:17.430
And again, we're talking about
bleeding edge performance.

01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:20.380
Ultimately, you might end up
being in a position where

01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:23.340
you're actually going to
have to target the game

01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:25.200
individually to different
devices.

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.770
We really like to avoid that.

01:00:26.770 --> 01:00:29.930
My general guideline is do as
much as you can to try to make

01:00:29.930 --> 01:00:33.640
sure the game is playable
in some form.

01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:34.090
IAN NI-LEWIS: All right.

01:00:34.090 --> 01:00:36.530
Well, we are coming
up on an hour now.

01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:39.180
And I think we are
just about done.

01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:43.300
And Engineer Dan wants to
get back to his life.

01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:45.250
And we're out of beer.

01:00:45.250 --> 01:00:45.920
DAN GALPIN: Oh crap.

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:48.620
IAN NI-LEWIS: So I guess we're
gonna call it a day.

01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:50.660
Yes, it was great having
you with us.

01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:52.110
Thanks very much
for tuning in.

01:00:52.110 --> 01:00:54.180
We will be back next week.

01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:58.020
We are playing with the format
of this show because we

01:00:58.020 --> 01:00:59.390
started out as a review show.

01:00:59.390 --> 01:01:01.355
We wanted to introduce
some games that

01:01:01.355 --> 01:01:02.840
we hadn't seen before.

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:06.430
And now we kind of feel like
maybe we'd rather do a little

01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:07.160
bit more engineering.

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:09.500
It's always been a
developer-focused show, and

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:13.170
we're thinking maybe we'd like
to do a deep dive on some

01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:16.400
games that have performance
problems or design problems.

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:18.120
So let us know what
you'd like.

01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:20.570
Of course, you can always
contact us on the Android

01:01:20.570 --> 01:01:23.520
developers Google+ page.

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:26.490
Or if you want to send us a
personal message on G+ too, we

01:01:26.490 --> 01:01:27.850
may actually see that.

01:01:27.850 --> 01:01:28.180
You never know.

01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:28.515
DAN GALPIN: Absolutely.

01:01:28.515 --> 01:01:29.510
It happens.

01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:35.560
IAN NI-LEWIS: And with that,
let's go ahead and have a

01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:36.530
little Android play us out.

01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:38.130
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, and definitely
continue to

01:01:38.130 --> 01:01:40.230
nominate applications
[INAUDIBLE].

01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:42.260
And you can even say, look, this
application would be just

01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:43.950
awesome if it performed
better.

01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:44.530
That's great.

01:01:44.530 --> 01:01:45.300
We'll take a look at it.

01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:47.630
We'll try to figure out why
is doesn't perform faster.

01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:50.340
So again, let us know
what you want to do,

01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:50.930
what you want to see.

01:01:50.930 --> 01:01:52.950
This is your show.

01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:53.770
IAN NI-LEWIS: No.

01:01:53.770 --> 01:01:54.330
DAN GALPIN: It is.

01:01:54.330 --> 01:01:55.750
IAN NI-LEWIS: It's kinda
your show now.

01:01:55.750 --> 01:01:57.530
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, it is.

01:01:57.530 --> 01:01:58.500
But there's a moderator page.

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.380
Continue to nominate things you
want to see on the show

01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:02.290
and have a great weekend,
everyone.

01:02:02.290 --> 01:02:03.010
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's right.

01:02:03.010 --> 01:02:04.640
Come on, little Android.

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:05.890
Little Android.
