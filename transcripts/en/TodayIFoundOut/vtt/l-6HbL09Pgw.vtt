00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.890
A manly hero coming to the rescue of a beautiful
damsel in distress has been a common trope

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.829
since literally the earliest days of theater,
going all the way back to the Ancient Greeks.

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.649
As the centuries passed, mythical creatures
were replaced by more mundane dangers- notable

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.149
to the topic at hand is the common trope of
top hat clad, magnificently mustachioed villains

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:58.079
tying buxom damsels to railway tracks while
a dashing hero rushes in to save the day.

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.649
So where exactly did this railway trope actually
come from and are there any known cases of

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:06.030
someone actually doing this in real life?

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.630
To begin with, while your first instinct might
be to assume that this trope originated during

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.140
the era of silent films, this isn’t quite
correct, though it is true you can find isolated

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.979
examples of this in a few surviving films.

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.390
For example, the 1913 film Barney Oldfield’s
Race for a Life is commonly touted as the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.280
first film to feature the “chained to a
railway” scene, including a mustachioed

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.409
villain wearing a fetching hat, a beguiling
beauty tied to the railway tracks and a daring,

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.130
last-minute rescue by a handsome hero.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.729
The thing is, this was a comedy specifically
created to lampoon the trope.

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.600
In another similar example, we have the 1917
film Teddy at the Throttle in which the fair

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.840
maiden, played by Gloria Swanson, humorously
rescues herself from peril because the “dashing”

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.700
hero arrives too late.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.690
To find the true origin of the trope, at least
in terms of what popularized it, we have to

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.520
go back to stage plays, with it commonly stated
that Augustin Daly’s 1867 play, Under the

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.149
Gaslight by American was first.

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.100
This does indeed contain such a scene, in
this case where a character named Snorkey

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.850
is tied to the rails by a man named Byke.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.220
As he’s doing this, Byke exclaims,

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.980
I’m going to put you to bed.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.100
You won’t toss much.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.110
In less than ten minutes you’ll be sound
asleep.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.989
There, how do you like it ? You’ll get down
to the Branch before me, will you?

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.770
You dog me and play the eavesdropper, eh I
Now do it if you can.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.710
When you hear the thunder under your head
and see the lights dancing in your eyes, and

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.100
feel the iron wheels a foot from your neck,
remember Byke!

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.290
Thankfully for Snorkey, in a sort of reversal
of the gender roles in the scene, a damsel

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.860
named Laura manages to come to his rescue
and free him just before the train arrives.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.110
While, as noted, Daly is commonly given credit
for coming up with the idea, it turns out

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.349
this isn’t correct at all; it was simply
his play that popularized it.

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.849
For example, sticking with theater, if you
dig a little deeper, a similar scene also

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:00.269
appeared in a previous play called The Engineer
released in 1863 in Britain.

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:05.129
Nevertheless the effect the scene in Daly’s
play had on the audience was so good that

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:09.600
rival playwrights quickly began including
“railroad scenes” in their own melodramas,

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.530
much to Daly’s chagrin.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.480
To try to protect the concept he felt he’d
come up with, he decided to sue those who

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.300
used it in their own plays.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.470
Despite instances like a short story, Captain
Tom’s Fright, released before Daly’s play

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.799
featuring an extremely similar scene being
used by the defense, the courts weren’t

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.080
persuaded and the case became a landmark one
in the history of copyright law in the United

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.080
States.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.260
It was specifically ruled that copying the
essence of a scene closely in other plays

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.730
did indeed infringe on intellectual property
rights, even if no words were copied and it

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.510
wasn’t literally the exact same scene.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.380
Nevertheless, theatre promoters heroically
ignored this ruling, continuing to rip Daly

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.830
off anyway, presumably dually under the assumption
that Daly wouldn’t get around to suing everyone

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.879
and that if enough modifications were made
to the scene they’d probably get away with

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:53.879
it either way.

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:58.459
Similarly back in the UK, the trope also spread
like wildfire with one Nicholas Daly noting

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:03.569
in his paper, Blood on the Tracks: Sensation
Drama, the Railway, and the Dark Face of Modernity,

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.860
“In October 1868 the railroad scene could
be witnessed in five different plays at five

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.120
different London theaters.”

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.640
So that’s how the trope was popularized,
but has anyone ever actually been tied to

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.440
a railroad track in that way?

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.060
It turns out, while it’s rare- yes.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.390
There are several known instances of this
happening.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.690
For example, according to the August 31, 1874
issue of the New York Times, a Frenchman identified

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.860
by the paper as simply “Gardner” was killed
in this exact manner after being robbed and

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.659
left tied to a railway track.

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:39.330
However, in this specific case the unfortunate
Frenchman was able to partially free himself,

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.120
with the result being only the lower half
of his left leg being severed.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.080
Gardner survived long enough to offer a description
of his attackers to the authorities before

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.330
succumbing to his injuries.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.400
It’s noteworthy that this and several other
known cases in the following decades came

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.690
after the ubiquity of the trope in theater,
despite that trains had been around long since.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.020
Thus, much like the idea of mobsters putting
“concrete shoes” on people to send them

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.590
to sleep with the fishes, it would seem this
was first thought up by entertainers only

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.110
to be copied in various isolated instances
by real life people.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.030
As for a more modern example of the train
trope, and one which actually includes a damsel,

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.350
this involves another Frenchman, Guillaume
Grémy, in 2017.

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.590
Unfortunately for all involved, not only was
Guillaume not sporting a magnificent moustache

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:29.139
and top hat at the time of his crime, he also
completely took the fun out of the thing.

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:32.039
You see, Guillaume was suffering from severe
depression at the time.

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:36.020
When efforts to get back together with his
estranged wife, Émilie Hallouin, failed,

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.690
he decided on her 34th birthday to bind her
to a high-speed railway track using, to quote

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.780
a police spokesman, “strong adhesive tape”,
and then stood over her as the train approached.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:51.330
Sadly, real life being real life, there was
no dashing hero to save the day here and tragically

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.889
for the couple, their toddler child and other
respective children, the pair were killed

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:59.789
instantly when the train hit them at a reported
200 MPH…

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:04.460
So, yes, indeed there have been several known
cases of people being murdered via being placed

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.750
on railroad tracks, but sadly, as far as we
can tell, rescue after the villain places

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:34.120
the victim on the tracks seems to be something
only found in fiction.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:07:15.729
It has long been rumored that

00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:23.110
as part of its notoriously brutal selection
process the SAS will tie prospective recruits

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:27.500
to a railway track whilst blindfolded to teach
them how to stay calm under pressure.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.650
The SAS trainers will then feign panic and
pretend that something has gone wrong all

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:34.479
while the sound of an oncoming train can be
heard.

00:07:34.479 --> 00:07:38.620
In reality, the recruit is tied to an adjacent
piece of track and trainers will observe what,

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:42.650
if anything, the recruit does during their
predicament.

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:46.180
Beyond tying the living to tracks, there are
also known cases of people putting the dead

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:50.090
on tracks to try to get away with murder by
making it look like an accident.

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:54.849
Perhaps the most well-known example of this
is the 1993 case of two year old James Bulger.

00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:59.240
We’ll spare you the truly horrific details
of the murder itself at the hands of two young

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:03.901
boys, but suffice it to say that in an attempt
to make the death look an accident, the two

00:08:03.901 --> 00:08:07.370
kids placed the already mangled tiny body
onto a railway track.

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:11.620
It was subsequently run over, but this did
little to hide the preexisting injuries and

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:24.990
the police soon enough tracked down the two
young perpetrators.
