00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.900
You've gone to a fruit stand
to get some fresh produce.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.250
You notice that the
person in front of you

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.530
gets 5 apples and
4 oranges for $10.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:18.170
You get 5 apples and
5 oranges for $11.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.590
Can we solve for the price
of an apple and an orange

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.170
using this information
in a system

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.220
of linear equations
in two variables?

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.090
If yes, what is the solution?

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.525
If no, what is the
reason we cannot?

00:00:28.525 --> 00:00:30.650
So we're trying to figure
out the price of an apple

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.770
and the price of an orange.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.760
So I would use a for apple, but
I don't like using o for orange

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.760
because o looks too
much like a zero.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.540
So I'll just say x for apples.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.333
Let's let x equal
the price of apples.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.410
And let's let y equal
the price of oranges.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.200
So let's describe what
happened to the person in line

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.220
in front of us.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.080
They bought 5 apples.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.100
So how much did they
spend on apples?

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.560
Well, they bought 5 apples
times x dollars per apple,

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.660
so they spent 5x dollars
on their 5 apples.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.250
And they bought 4 oranges.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.420
They bought 4 oranges
times y dollars per orange.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.980
So they spent 4y on oranges.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.440
So the total amount that
they spent is 5x plus 4y.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.540
And they tell us
that this is $10.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.450
This is equal to $10.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.120
Now, you get in line,
and you buy 5 apples.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.440
So you buy 5 apples, just
like the guy in front of you.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.980
And you paid x
dollars per apple.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.060
So you're going to pay 5 apples
times the price per apple.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.300
This is the amount that
you spend on apples.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.800
And then you buy 5 oranges.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.980
So you're going to pay 5 oranges
times the price per orange,

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:54.860
which is y.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.730
So this is how much
you spend on oranges.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.730
This is how much you spend on
apples and oranges, the sum.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.510
And they tell us
that this is $11.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.490
So can we solve
for an x and a y?

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.020
And it looks like we can.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.590
And a big giveaway
right over here

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.817
is the ratio between the x's and
the y's in these two equations

00:02:14.817 --> 00:02:15.400
are different.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.520
So we're getting some
information here.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.050
If the ratios were
exactly the same,

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.142
if this was 5x plus
4y right over here,

00:02:21.142 --> 00:02:23.600
and we got a different number,
then we would be in trouble.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.980
Because we bought
the same combination,

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.269
but we got a different price.

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.810
But the good thing is is that
we have a different combination

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:29.730
here.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.520
So let's see if we
can work it out.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.930
Now, the most obvious
thing that jumps out at me

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.820
is that I have a 5x here, and
I have a 5x right over here.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.240
So if I could subtract
this 5x from that 5x,

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.090
then I would cancel
out all of the x terms.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.590
So what I'm going
to do is I'm going

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.190
to multiply this bottom
equation by negative 1.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.750
So it becomes negative
5x plus negative 5y

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.700
is equal to negative 11.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.980
And then I'm going
to essentially add

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.230
both of these equations.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.190
And I could do that
because I'm doing

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.470
the same thing to both sides.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.190
I already know that this
thing is equal to this thing.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.100
So I'm just adding those
things to either side.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.620
So on the left hand
side, I have 5x minus 5x.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.280
Well, those cancel out.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.470
And then I have 4y minus 5y.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.100
Well, that's negative y.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.080
And that's going to be
equal to 10 minus 11,

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.100
which is negative 1.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.370
And then if we multiply
both sides of this times

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.870
negative 1, or divide
both sides by negative 1,

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.046
we're going to get
y is equal to 1.

00:03:30.046 --> 00:03:31.920
So just like that, we
were able to figure out

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:32.820
the price of oranges.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.780
It's $1 per orange.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.130
So this is equal to 1.

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.940
Now let's figure out
the price of apples.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.240
So we can go back into
either 1 of these equations.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.230
I'll go back into this first 1.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.720
So 5 times-- so let's go to the
person in line in front of us.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.960
They bought 5 apples
at x dollars per apple,

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:56.135
plus 4 oranges at $1 per orange,
and they spent a total of $10.

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.310
So this of course is just 4.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.590
Let's subtract 4
from both sides,

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.420
and we get-- well, 4 times 1
minus 4, that just cancels out.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.070
We're just going to be left
with 5x on the left hand side.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.920
And on the right hand
side, we have 10 minus 4,

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.540
which is equal to 6.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.490
And we can just divide both
sides by 6 now in order

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.790
to solve for x.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.490
Oh, sorry.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.850
We can divide both sides by
5 in order to solve for x.

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:32.800
It's late in the day.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.634
Brain isn't working.

00:04:33.634 --> 00:04:35.383
Dividing by 6 wouldn't
have done anything.

00:04:35.383 --> 00:04:36.470
We would have gotten 5/6x.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.350
We just want to get an x here.

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:44.240
So dividing both sides by 5, we
get x is equal to 6/5 dollars.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.520
Or you could say that
x is equal to 6/5,

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.900
which is the same
thing as 1 and 1/5,

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.540
which is the same
thing as $1.20.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.410
So it's $1 per orange,
and $1.20 per apple.

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.500
So we absolutely
could figure out

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.980
the prices of apples and oranges
using the information given.
