00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.930
Okay, so if you know how to appropriately interpret the code down here and

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.070
compare the structure and the letter to what you see in the order here, you

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:15.170
should've gotten C or cytosene, T or thymine.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.320
C again for cytocene and T again for thymine. A

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.310
for adenine. G for guanine, T for

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.980
thiamine, G guanine again, and another guanine,

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.430
an A for adenine, and the last would be C, for cytosine.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.210
So we would have in order of CTCTAGTGGAC.
