00:00:00.211 --> 00:00:02.294
- [Instructor] We're told consider the sum

00:00:02.294 --> 00:00:05.399
two plus five plus eight plus 11.

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:09.046
Which expression is
equal to the sum above?

00:00:09.046 --> 00:00:12.435
And they tell us choose
all answers that apply.

00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:13.943
So like always, pause the video,

00:00:13.943 --> 00:00:16.814
and see if you can work
through this on your own.

00:00:16.814 --> 00:00:18.178
So when you look at the sum,

00:00:18.178 --> 00:00:20.037
it's clear you're starting at two.

00:00:20.037 --> 00:00:23.148
You're adding three each time.

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:25.975
And we also are dealing with

00:00:25.975 --> 00:00:28.401
you have four total terms.

00:00:28.401 --> 00:00:30.605
Now we could try to
construct an equation here

00:00:30.605 --> 00:00:32.909
or an expression using sigma notation.

00:00:32.909 --> 00:00:35.229
But instead, what I like to
do, is look at our options.

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:37.783
We really only have to look
at these two options here

00:00:37.783 --> 00:00:39.226
and expand them out.

00:00:39.226 --> 00:00:41.873
What sum would each of these be?

00:00:41.873 --> 00:00:43.673
Well, this is going to be the same thing

00:00:43.673 --> 00:00:45.649
as we're starting at n equals one.

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.714
So this is going to be three
times, when n equals one,

00:00:48.714 --> 00:00:50.745
three times one minus one.

00:00:50.745 --> 00:00:54.035
And then plus, then
we'll go to n equals two.

00:00:54.035 --> 00:00:56.202
Three times two minus one.

00:00:57.135 --> 00:00:59.262
Then we're gonna go to n equals three.

00:00:59.262 --> 00:01:02.262
So plus three times three minus one.

00:01:03.486 --> 00:01:06.138
And then finally, we're
gonna go to n equals four.

00:01:06.138 --> 00:01:08.777
So plus three times, when n equals four,

00:01:08.777 --> 00:01:12.002
this is three times four minus one.

00:01:12.002 --> 00:01:16.126
So just to be clear, this is
what we did when n equals one.

00:01:16.126 --> 00:01:16.959
Let me write it down.

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:18.287
N equals one.

00:01:18.287 --> 00:01:22.170
This is what we got when n equals two.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.002
This is what we got when n equals three.

00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:30.002
And this is what we got
when n is equal to four.

00:01:31.434 --> 00:01:33.667
And we stopped at n equals four

00:01:33.667 --> 00:01:35.692
'cause it tells us right over there,

00:01:35.692 --> 00:01:36.663
we start at n equals one

00:01:36.663 --> 00:01:38.568
and we go all of the way to n equals four.

00:01:38.568 --> 00:01:40.218
So what does this equal?

00:01:40.218 --> 00:01:44.072
So let's see, three times
one minus one is two.

00:01:44.072 --> 00:01:45.978
So this is looking good so far.

00:01:45.978 --> 00:01:48.587
Three times two minus one,

00:01:48.587 --> 00:01:49.938
that's six minus one.

00:01:49.938 --> 00:01:51.279
That is five.

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:52.810
So still looking good.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.047
Three times three minus
one, that's nine minus one.

00:01:56.047 --> 00:01:58.059
Once again, still looking good.

00:01:58.059 --> 00:02:00.487
Three times four minus one,

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:01.404
that is 11.

00:02:02.365 --> 00:02:03.629
So we like this choice,

00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:05.714
so I would definitely select this one.

00:02:05.714 --> 00:02:08.197
Now let's do the same thing over here.

00:02:08.197 --> 00:02:10.197
When n is equal to zero,

00:02:11.345 --> 00:02:15.379
it's going to be two
plus three times zero.

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.177
So that's just going to be two.

00:02:17.177 --> 00:02:20.107
And then plus, when n is equal to one,

00:02:20.107 --> 00:02:23.059
it's going to be two plus three times one,

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:24.032
which is five.

00:02:24.032 --> 00:02:25.474
This is starting to look good.

00:02:25.474 --> 00:02:28.028
Now when n is equal to,
this was n equals zero,

00:02:28.028 --> 00:02:29.129
this was n equals one,

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:30.925
so now we're at n equals two.

00:02:30.925 --> 00:02:32.367
So at n equals two,

00:02:32.367 --> 00:02:34.367
two plus three times two

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.503
is two plus six, which is eight.

00:02:38.503 --> 00:02:39.336
And this makes sense.

00:02:39.336 --> 00:02:42.511
Every time we increase n by one,

00:02:42.511 --> 00:02:45.135
we are adding another three,

00:02:45.135 --> 00:02:46.606
which is consistent
with what we saw there.

00:02:46.606 --> 00:02:48.702
We start at two, when n equals zero,

00:02:48.702 --> 00:02:50.822
this is just, that three n is just zero.

00:02:50.822 --> 00:02:52.556
So you start at two, and then you keep,

00:02:52.556 --> 00:02:55.094
every time you increase n by one,

00:02:55.094 --> 00:02:56.943
you are just adding three again.

00:02:56.943 --> 00:02:58.727
So finally, when n is equal to three,

00:02:58.727 --> 00:03:02.370
two plus three times three is two plus,

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.845
or is

00:03:03.845 --> 00:03:05.538
11, I should say.

00:03:05.538 --> 00:03:08.731
And so this also is exactly the same sum.

00:03:08.731 --> 00:03:12.137
So I feel good about both of these.

00:03:12.137 --> 00:03:14.304
Let's do one more example.

00:03:15.962 --> 00:03:18.102
So we're here, we're given the sum,

00:03:18.102 --> 00:03:19.711
and we're saying choose one answer.

00:03:19.711 --> 00:03:22.881
Which of these is equivalent
to this sum right over here?

00:03:22.881 --> 00:03:25.556
Well, like we did before,
let's just expand it out.

00:03:25.556 --> 00:03:28.562
And what's different here is
that we just have a variable,

00:03:28.562 --> 00:03:31.430
but that shouldn't make it
too much more difficult.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.299
So let's do the situation,
and I'll write it out.

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.901
Let's do the situation
when n is equal to one.

00:03:35.901 --> 00:03:40.823
When n is equal to one, it's
gonna be k over one plus one.

00:03:40.823 --> 00:03:43.897
K over one plus one,
and I'll write it out.

00:03:43.897 --> 00:03:45.894
This is n is equal to one.

00:03:45.894 --> 00:03:48.469
And then plus, when n is equal to two,

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:50.206
it's gonna be k

00:03:50.206 --> 00:03:51.706
over two plus one.

00:03:52.695 --> 00:03:55.113
This is n is equal to two.

00:03:55.113 --> 00:03:56.240
And then we're gonna keep going.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.741
When n is equal to three,

00:03:57.741 --> 00:03:59.544
it's gonna be k

00:03:59.544 --> 00:04:01.211
over three plus one.

00:04:02.317 --> 00:04:04.459
That's n is equal to three.

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:05.987
And then plus, finally,

00:04:05.987 --> 00:04:09.151
'cause we stop right over
here at n equals four,

00:04:09.151 --> 00:04:13.318
when n equals four, it's going
to be k over four plus one.

00:04:14.968 --> 00:04:17.150
That's when n is equal to four.

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.843
So this is all going to be equal,

00:04:18.843 --> 00:04:19.910
I'll just write it over here,

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.935
this is equal to k over two,

00:04:22.935 --> 00:04:24.435
plus k over three,

00:04:25.586 --> 00:04:27.003
plus k over four,

00:04:28.743 --> 00:04:30.970
plus k over five,

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.303
which is exactly this choice right over,

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.395
right over here.

00:04:37.395 --> 00:04:39.600
And actually, if I had looked
at the choices ahead of time,

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.512
I might have even been
able to save even more time

00:04:41.512 --> 00:04:43.832
by just saying, well, look,

00:04:43.832 --> 00:04:45.939
actually, if you just try
to compute the first term,

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:48.655
when n is equal to one,
it would be k over two.

00:04:48.655 --> 00:04:52.140
Well, only this one is
starting with a k over two.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.695
This, this one has no k's
here, which is sketchy.

00:04:55.695 --> 00:04:57.137
They're trying to look at the error

00:04:57.137 --> 00:05:00.422
where you try to replace the
k with the number as well,

00:05:00.422 --> 00:05:01.361
not just the n.

00:05:01.361 --> 00:05:03.017
So that's what they're trying to do here.

00:05:03.017 --> 00:05:05.719
Here they're trying to, let's see,

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:10.091
well, this isn't as obvious
what they're even trying to do,

00:05:10.091 --> 00:05:12.619
right over here where they
put the k in the denominator.

00:05:12.619 --> 00:05:15.369
And here if you swapped the n and the k's,

00:05:15.369 --> 00:05:17.682
then you would've gotten
this thing right over here.

00:05:17.682 --> 00:05:20.524
So we definitely feel good about choice A.
