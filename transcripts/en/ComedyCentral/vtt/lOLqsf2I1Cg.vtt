But first, we have with us
two local admen

00:00:05.571 --> 00:00:07.673 align:start position:0%
who started their own
T-shirt company.

00:00:07.706 --> 00:00:10.643 align:start position:0% line:0%
Tim Cramblin and Sam Duvet,
welcome.

00:00:10.676 --> 00:00:12.311 align:end position:100% line:0%
- Thanks for having us
on the show, Nadine.

00:00:12.344 --> 00:00:13.579 size:88% position:44% line:0%
- We watch you all the time.

00:00:13.612 --> 00:00:15.148 align:start position:0%
- Oh, Thanks. Now--

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:17.050
- Not--not like
in a stalker way

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:18.418
'cause, you know--

00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:20.520
not like a person
who's, like, obsessed.

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:22.221
- Chill out.
- Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

00:00:22.254 --> 00:00:23.823
- Don't touch her.
- I won't. It's not--

00:00:23.856 --> 00:00:25.691 align:start position:0%
- Tell us
about the T-shirts.

00:00:25.724 --> 00:00:28.394 align:end position:100%
- Well, it seems like
everywhere you go these days,

00:00:28.427 --> 00:00:30.696 align:end position:100%
you see T-shirts
with Detroit slogans on them.

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:32.532 size:75% position:38%
- Psh, you said it, Tim.

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:34.734
You may be familiar
with "Detroit vs. Everybody."

00:00:34.767 --> 00:00:36.702 align:start size:50% position:50%
- Just the best.

00:00:36.735 --> 00:00:37.837
- And "Detroit Hustles Harder."

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.238 align:start size:63% position:38%
- You can't beat it.

00:00:39.271 --> 00:00:41.274 align:start position:0%
- You sure can't,
which is why

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:43.109 align:end position:100%
we're proud
to present to you

00:00:43.142 --> 00:00:47.413 align:start position:0%
our very own T-shirt,
"De-two-roit."

00:00:47.446 --> 00:00:49.348 align:end position:100%
- And we'd like to thank
our crew members

00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:51.217 align:start size:66% position:34%
Lea and Tommy Pencils

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.120
for modeling our "De-two-roit" 
T-shirts today.

00:00:54.153 --> 00:00:56.722 align:end position:100%
Uh, take it easy on Tommy.
He's a little nervous.

00:00:56.755 --> 00:01:00.259 align:end position:100%
He's not used to being in front
of the camera for a change.

00:01:00.292 --> 00:01:01.694 align:start position:0%
- Well, I got
to be honest, guys.

00:01:01.727 --> 00:01:02.862 align:start position:0%
I don't get it.

00:01:02.895 --> 00:01:04.363 size:78% position:39%
It looks like you put a 2

00:01:04.396 --> 00:01:05.798 align:start position:0%
where the T should be.

00:01:05.831 --> 00:01:07.867 align:start position:0%
- Uh, no, not looks like.
That's what we did.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.570 align:end position:100%
- Yeah, so now
it's "De-two-roit."

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:13.306 align:start position:0%
- "De-two-roit."

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:14.707
- But why?

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.275
- Well...
- Asking--

00:01:16.308 --> 00:01:18.611 align:start position:0%
- That can best be explained
by a freestyle rap

00:01:18.644 --> 00:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
performed by Lea
and Tommy Pencils.

00:01:20.913 --> 00:01:22.615 align:start position:0%
- Sounds like fun.

00:01:22.648 --> 00:01:25.418 align:start position:0%
Lea, Tommy Pencils,
take it away.
