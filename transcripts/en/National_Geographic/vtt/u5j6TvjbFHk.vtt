00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.680
(mellow music)

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.410
- We're 300 meters off the
coast of Santo Espiritu Island,

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.710
and we're lighting an
area to attract plankton.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.450
Mobulas feed on plankton. Hopefully,

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:17.430
they'll come close to us

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.590
and we'll be able to swim with them.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.180
(mellow music)

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.720
First, plankton come,

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.510
then mobulas appear.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.540
These stingrays have been around
for over 20 million years,

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.380
but divers like us are recent.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.900
As future visitors are
summoned to the feeding frenzy,

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.810
and the sanctuary is threatened.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.360
(mellow music)

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.470
What can we do for a
world worth protecting?

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.840
National Geographic and Rolex

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.140
are sending me across Baja California,

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.580
to explore the way wildlife
tourism is evolving

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.580
in one of the most biodiverse
regions on the planet.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.200
My first stop is Cabo Pulmo.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.000
I'm here to meet David Castro,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.030
whose family was
instrumental in transforming

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.670
a small fishing village

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.200
into a global model of sustainability.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.720
- In the '90s, overfishing

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.150
had decimated Cabo Pulmo's sea life.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.330
The reef fell sick and the
local economy faltered.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.430
- The Castros and their
neighbors took a chance.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.600
They made a pact to stop fishing
and bet on tourism instead.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.530
Today, David is taking me
on a dive with bull sharks,

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.730
to show me how well Cabo
Pulmo's marine population

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.420
has recovered since it became
a Nationally Protected Area.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.650
So, we're 500 meters away from the coast,

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:13.090
and there's probably like 10 bull sharks

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.700
underneath us right now and

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.300
we are the crazy people that are gonna go

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.500
under and dive with them.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.170
I'm super excited.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.260
I won't lie, I'm a little scared,
but I think that's normal.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.900
It's the first time I'm
gonna dive with sharks.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.480
(mellow music)

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.240
As we dive, we come
across a school of jacks,

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.470
swirling like an underwater tornado.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.970
(mellow music)

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.970
David, suspended in space,
is wrapped and swallowed.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.820
(mellow music)

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.720
From afar, they are a
humbling force of nature,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.690
up close, a wall of drifting eyes.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.270
(mellow music)

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.700
This is what a healthy reef looks like.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.280
(mellow music)

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.020
I almost forget why we're here.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.610
(mellow music)

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.910
And then, the sharks come.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.780
(mellow music)

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.990
Sharks have a negative reputation,

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.440
but seeing them up close
changes everything.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.020
(mellow music)

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.900
Fear gives way to reverence,

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.100
and reverence transforms
into the desire to protect.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.340
- Tourism is kind of the
blood flow that allows —

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:11.030
- Cabo Pulmo managed to build
a blueprint of sustainability

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.540
the community is eager
to share with the world.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.250
My next stop is the
Island of Espiritu Santo,

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.260
a neighboring wildlife hot spot,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.500
located in the Sea of Cortez.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.580
- A National Sanctuary
and UNESCO Protected Park,

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.610
this cluster of small islands

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.240
was almost developed into a casino resort,

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.580
until locals petitioned the
government for protection.

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.670
Since it was declared a
Nationally Protected Area

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.900
in 1995, small tour
boats having been taking

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.030
adventurous travelers to
explore what many consider to be

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.950
the world's richest outdoor aquarium.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.270
- While most tourists
snorkel with sea lions,

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:35.780
we decide to dive.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.540
We swim towards the
massive rock formations

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.050
jutting from the ocean floor.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:47.390
Between the towers of red
rock, sea lions play in a cave.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.050
They are fast and agile,

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.140
and although they gently bite
our hands and scuba suits,

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.380
it's not easy to keep their attention.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:05.020
A new tour group arrives,
then another, and another.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.420
Suddenly dozens of tourists
invade the surface above us,

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.520
blocking the sunlight,
and the sea lions scatter.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.490
Guides call this the red wave.

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:21.240
Red, the color of their life vests.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.110
I wonder if activities like these

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.840
are blurring the line
between natural sanctuary

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.380
and amusement park.

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:35.650
I'm on my way to La Paz Bay to explore

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:39.080
Baja's most established
wildlife adventure.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.970
The way tourism has evolved here

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:44.330
may serve as an example
for newer activities.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:47.040
I'm meeting Dení Ramirez,

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:51.270
La Paz's foremost whale shark
expert and conservationist.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.780
Her work has been instrumental in ensuring

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:56.410
tourism isn't harming the whale shark.

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:12.190
- Dení takes volunteers
on her research missions.

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.840
By including visitors, she hopes to forge

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:18.500
a stronger balance between
tourism and conservation.

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:23.330
Whale sharks are migratory and
collect by the hundreds here

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.740
when the waters are warm
and rich with nutrients.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:29.050
They filter thousands of gallons of water

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:30.700
through their gills to capture the

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:34.120
massive blooms of plankton they
need to sustain their diet.

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:37.620
The camera she places
on its fin will yield

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:41.160
intimate footage from the
whale shark's point of view.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.750
(mellow music)

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.290
The goal is to see how
the shark's behavior

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:52.540
changes in the presence
of people and boats.

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.120
(mellow music)

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:31.690
- In traveling through Baja,

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:34.790
I've seen the impact of wildlife tourism.

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:37.130
It can transform a local economy

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:39.520
and help sustain a natural habitat.

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:43.820
To find that balance, we must blur the line

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.990
between local, visitor,
and conservationist.
