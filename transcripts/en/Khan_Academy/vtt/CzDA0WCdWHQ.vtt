00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.025
In the last couple of videos
we set a scenario where

00:00:03.025 --> 00:00:06.609
company A intends to acquire company B.

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:09.078
Their going to do it by
issuing 2 million shares

00:00:09.078 --> 00:00:11.944
and then giving those
2 million shares to the

00:00:11.944 --> 00:00:14.611
shareholders of company B, and company B

00:00:14.611 --> 00:00:16.353
shareholders will give,
essentially, all of their

00:00:16.353 --> 00:00:19.105
ownership away. Their will
be an exchange 2 million

00:00:19.105 --> 00:00:22.943
of company A shares for 1
million of company B shares.

00:00:22.943 --> 00:00:26.694
On a [per search 0:24] share
basis the owners of company B

00:00:26.694 --> 00:00:29.699
will give up one of their
shares, and in exchange

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.028
they will get 2 shares of company A.

00:00:33.028 --> 00:00:36.618
They will get 2 shares in company.

00:00:36.618 --> 00:00:39.030
We saw that if everyone
thought that this transaction

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.469
was going to happen,
theoretically, whatever

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:44.069
A is trading at B should
trade at twice that.

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:46.621
People know that they'll
always be a little trade-in,

00:00:46.621 --> 00:00:48.875
or when the transaction
happens there be a little

00:00:48.875 --> 00:00:52.670
trade-in of B for two of these A shares.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.139
What happens is a
situation, or why would a

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:59.201
situation happen where B
doesn't trade at twice of A?

00:00:59.201 --> 00:01:02.072
This is a theoretical trading twice is A.

00:01:02.072 --> 00:01:05.333
This is 2 times A.

00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.136
What happens if it doesn't trade there?

00:01:07.136 --> 00:01:10.411
What happens if B's shares are trading ...

00:01:10.411 --> 00:01:12.474
let me do this in a color
I haven't used before.

00:01:12.474 --> 00:01:16.286
What if it's trading a
little bit lower there?

00:01:16.286 --> 00:01:18.370
Well, that might be the
case, because some people

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.875
don't think that the
transactions going to happen.

00:01:21.875 --> 00:01:24.736
Their not willing to pay that full premium

00:01:24.736 --> 00:01:27.072
for B. Let's say that this were to happen,

00:01:27.072 --> 00:01:30.042
and you are working at
some type of a hedge fund

00:01:30.042 --> 00:01:32.474
that has some type of model,
maybe some mathematical

00:01:32.474 --> 00:01:34.625
model, maybe you have some
type of shady information.

00:01:34.625 --> 00:01:38.550
Where you know for a fact,
you are 100% certain,

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.047
this transaction is going
to close. It's definitely

00:01:41.047 --> 00:01:46.204
going to close with these
terms. 2 million shares

00:01:46.204 --> 00:01:49.047
of A in exchange for
1 million shares of B.

00:01:49.047 --> 00:01:52.138
Your temptation might be,
well, why don't I just

00:01:52.138 --> 00:01:56.473
buy these shares of B,
because they will go up.

00:01:56.473 --> 00:01:58.136
What if the whole market goes down?

00:01:58.136 --> 00:02:02.380
What if the stock of
A goes down like this?

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.555
Then 2 times A will also go down.

00:02:04.555 --> 00:02:06.801
You don't want to just buy
the stock of B thinking

00:02:06.801 --> 00:02:09.712
it's going to go up. If
the transaction is really

00:02:09.712 --> 00:02:12.719
going to happen, B is just
going to track 2 times

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:14.470
the price of A.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.302
The best way to do it is
to really set up a bit

00:02:17.302 --> 00:02:20.308
of a pair trade here. What
you would do is if you

00:02:20.308 --> 00:02:22.676
think the transaction
is definitely happening,

00:02:22.676 --> 00:02:28.336
you could buy 1 share ...
let me write this down.

00:02:28.336 --> 00:02:35.224
You could buy 1 share of B. Share of B.

00:02:35.224 --> 00:02:38.403
You've gone long 1 share
of B. Then you can short

00:02:38.403 --> 00:02:47.721
2 shares of A. The reason
why this will work,

00:02:47.721 --> 00:02:49.876
and this will only work if you know the

00:02:49.876 --> 00:02:52.404
transaction is going to happen, is because

00:02:52.404 --> 00:02:55.890
right now 2 shares of
A are going to be ...

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.738
at any point since B is trading
a little bit of a discount

00:02:59.738 --> 00:03:02.132
to that, the 2 shares of
A are going to be worth

00:03:02.132 --> 00:03:04.700
more than that the 1 share of B.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.606
When you sort 2 shares
of A, maybe, where this

00:03:07.606 --> 00:03:09.829
point right here ...
let's say that we are at

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:12.269
this point on that day that everything was

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.545
announced. When you short
2 shares of A, you're

00:03:15.545 --> 00:03:17.271
going to get $60.

00:03:17.271 --> 00:03:20.608
You're going to get $60. This is a review.

00:03:20.608 --> 00:03:23.416
You borrow the stock,
you sell it, and you're

00:03:23.416 --> 00:03:25.583
going have to buy it
back at some future date.

00:03:25.583 --> 00:03:28.835
You owe someone 2 shares
of A. When you buy

00:03:28.835 --> 00:03:31.407
1 share of B, it's not
going to be trading at $60,

00:03:31.407 --> 00:03:33.268
it's going to be trading at some discount.

00:03:33.268 --> 00:03:38.005
Let's say that that cost
you $55. It's trading

00:03:38.005 --> 00:03:40.674
a little bit of discount to 2 times A.

00:03:40.674 --> 00:03:43.929
Clearly just here, you have netted.

00:03:43.929 --> 00:03:47.272
$60 minus $55, you have netted $5.

00:03:47.272 --> 00:03:51.533
$5 net. Then assuming
the transaction happens

00:03:51.533 --> 00:03:55.334
at some future date, when
the transaction closes,

00:03:55.334 --> 00:03:58.425
that 1 share of B that
you had, you can exchange

00:03:58.425 --> 00:04:02.336
it for 2 shares of A. You get 2 times A.

00:04:02.336 --> 00:04:04.758
Then you could use that
to cover your short

00:04:04.758 --> 00:04:07.469
position. You use that to cover your short

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:11.273
position, and you're
left standing with $5.

00:04:11.273 --> 00:04:13.348
You essentially made ...
well, there is a risk

00:04:13.348 --> 00:04:15.428
that the transaction
didn't close, but assuming

00:04:15.428 --> 00:04:17.538
the transaction happened,
this was kind of a

00:04:17.538 --> 00:04:20.676
[pedima 04:17] free $5 for your taking.
