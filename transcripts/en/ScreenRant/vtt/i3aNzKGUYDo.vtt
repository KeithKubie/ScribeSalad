00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.230
Have you heard of Bizarro World?

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.050
In the late 1960’s DC comics introduced
the idea of a Bizarro World, a world that

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.250
is opposite of our daily expectations.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.600
As fans watch their favorite films they speculate
on alternate versions of the plots, characters

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.770
or even the worlds these characters live.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.420
These conjectures can create some weird theories
that can change the way you look at some of

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.790
your favorite films, especially when they
are a cherished kids film.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:36.940
Rant’s list of ten Theories That Turn Kids
Movies into Creepy Movies.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:43.120
Frozen, Tangled and The Little Mermaid

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.859
We know that Rapunzel and Flynn were at Elsa's
coronation because we spotted them."

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:50.309
We know that the coronation takes place three
years after the death of Elsa and Anna’s

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.309
parents.

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:54.399
We also know that the films Tangled and Frozen
were released three years apart.

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.499
From the architecture in Tangled we can say
the movie takes place in Germany and the architecture

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:00.219
in Frozen puts us in Norway.

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.300
Did the Frozen parents travel to Germany for
Rapunzel and Flynn’s wedding but their ship

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.430
sank on the way there?

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.700
And in between Germany and Norway is Denmark,
which is home to a famous mermaid.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.670
Is the sunken ship that Ariel visits under
the sea the vessel of Elsa and Anna’s parents?

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.390
Mind blown!

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.390
The Rugrats Movie

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.409
The Rugrats Movie is based off the popular
Nickelodeon children’s cartoon, Rugrats.

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.149
The theory behind Rugrats is that the main
characters are just a figment of Angelica's

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:28.869
tortured imagination.

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.030
Angelica has no emotional connection to family
so she makes up these infants to belittle

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.470
and let her anger issues out.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.229
If that’s the case, Angelica needs to be
put in a padded room and on a well-balanced

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.689
diet of happy pills.

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:43.890
WALL-E

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.179
WALL-E is left on planet Earth to tidy up
the mess left by humans and he has spent the

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:51.969
last 700 years placing the mess into cubes.

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:56.909
This symbolic film about waste and the effects
on humans is a joy to watch and people easily

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.090
fall in love with the main character.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.009
One fan theory suggests that the reason the
planet was without humans is because WALL-E

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.820
killed them all and he’s cleaning up to
repent for his sins.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.330
This certainly would change the way we see
WALL-E but we’re pretty sure this adorable

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:20.510
robot didn’t do this because he can’t
even harm a bug.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.760
Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.730
The beloved children’s film Willy Wonka
&amp; the Chocolate Factory has given generations

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.629
of kids the dream of visiting Wonka’s factory.

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:31.850
But what if those dreams turned out to be
nightmares?

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.510
Some say that Wonka is actually a cannibal
and he’s taking the bad kids and preparing

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.410
them for meals.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.310
Augustus Gloop better hope that tube leads
to safety or he’s going to make a great

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.360
meal for Wonka, but let’s be honest.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.810
Wouldn’t you take the chance of being eaten
to be in that candy factory?

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.250
Toy Story and Toy Story 2

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.430
In the first Toy Story film Andy can be seen
wearing a cowboy hat and then in Toy Story

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.080
2 the owner of Jessie has the same kind of
hat.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.030
It’s theorized that Andy’s mom was the
original owner of Jessie and she passed down

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.280
her hat to her son.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.519
If this is true, it is sad that Jessie has
lived her entire life missing Emily and when

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.860
they are reunited Emily doesn’t recognize
her.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.560
It’s understandable for Jessie to not recognize
her because she aged but Emily seems to never

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.560
shed a tear.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.010
Luckily Jesse finds love with Buzz and has
a new set of friends.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.439
Wreck-It Ralph

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:30.879
In the film Wreck-It Ralph there’s a fictitious
arcade game called, Hero's Duty and the games

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:32.220
main heroine is Calhoun.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.840
Calhoun’s husband-to-be is eaten at the
alter by a Cy-Bug and Calhoun quickly pulls

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.410
out a pocket chain gun and kills the Cy-Bug.

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.180
In the film we learn that a Cy-Bug takes the
form of whatever they eat.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:50.010
When a Cy-Bug eats Ralph’s gun it takes
the form of that gun and when a Cy-Bug eats

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.920
candy it becomes candy.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:04:01.250
So Calhoun was actually shooting the love
of her life while sporting a wedding dress.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.189
Who Framed Roger Rabbit

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:07.519
Who Framed Roger Rabbit brought all of your
beloved cartoon characters in one film but

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.120
one theory suggests the plot reflects on a
dark period of American history.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.189
This theory suggests toons are minorities
that were being oppressed by whites in a reflection

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:16.709
of the Jim Crow era.

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.930
They are called toons in a derogatory way,
being oppressed, kicked out of their homes

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.460
and Christopher Lloyds character tries to
assimilate to human culture but cannot making

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.190
his character an Uncle Tom.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:33.770
Or it’s all about public transportation
and a voluptuous cartoon character?

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:34.770
Aladdin

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.310
When watching Aladdin as a kid you can’t
help but sit back and laugh at the antics

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.800
of Robin William’s Genie.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.669
But when you grew up you might have wondered
how the Genie knew Rodney Dangerfield or Jack

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:44.669
Nicholson?

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.460
How does he know what a 1950’s muscle car
looks like or what an applause sign is?

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.400
One theory is that Aladdin actually takes
place in the distant future, after a horrific

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.400
nuclear war.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:03.090
The Genie even complains about the accommodations
in his lamp.

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.389
Or maybe the Genie can time travel and that’s
why he’s going to Disneyland at the end

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:07.389
of the movie.

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:13.560
Either way we loved William’s jokes and
wouldn’t have it any other way.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.750
Star Wars

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.580
Some will argue Star Wars is not a kid’s
movie but go check your shelf and count how

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.380
many Star Wars figures you have up there.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.720
Then get back to us.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.110
This theory suggests that the treasured characters
R2-D2 and Chewbacca are actually traitors.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.770
R2-D2 avoids getting his memory deleted and
Chewbacca uses Han Solo as a pawn.

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.620
We’re going to stop right there because
we love those two characters and feel this

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.569
theory is traitorous and the person who thought
of it needs to meet Lord Vader.

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:41.210
The Incredibles

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:46.699
Atlas Shrugged is novel by Ayn Rand published
in 1957 about the philosophy Objectivism.

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:50.319
The Incredibles is about a married pair of
superhero’s who are forced to live mundane

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:53.940
lives after all super-powered activities have
been banned by the government.

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.890
Mr. Incredible’s talents are wasted in an
office and his son Dash is forced to never

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.009
show his super speed.

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:01.510
Exactly what Objectivism is against.

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.180
The main villain Syndrome wants to give everyone
the technology to be whatever they want to

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.610
be so everyone can be equal.

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.330
Once again being the essence of Objectivism.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.880
This is a deep theory for a kids film and
all we want to know if the plot of The Incredibles

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:13.880
2.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:23.750
