00:00:00.413 --> 00:00:02.247
- [Voiceover] The quadratic expression

00:00:02.247 --> 00:00:04.371
x-squared plus five x plus c

00:00:04.371 --> 00:00:06.218
is a perfect square.

00:00:06.218 --> 00:00:10.779
It can be factored as x plus d-squared.

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:15.779
Both c and d are positive
rational numbers.

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.644
What I wanna figure out in this video

00:00:17.644 --> 00:00:20.379
is what is c, given the information

00:00:20.379 --> 00:00:21.848
that we have right over here?

00:00:21.848 --> 00:00:24.111
What is c going to be equal to?

00:00:24.111 --> 00:00:26.619
And what is d going to be equal to?

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:27.884
Like always, pause the video

00:00:27.884 --> 00:00:30.112
and see if you can figure it out.

00:00:30.182 --> 00:00:31.769
Let's work through this together.

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.497
We're saying that x-squared
plus five x plus c

00:00:34.497 --> 00:00:38.223
can be rewritten as x plus d-squared.

00:00:38.223 --> 00:00:39.744
Let me write that down.

00:00:39.744 --> 00:00:42.414
So this part, this part,

00:00:42.414 --> 00:00:47.360
x-squared plus five x plus c,

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.671
we're saying that,

00:00:48.671 --> 00:00:51.353
that could be written as x plus d-squared.

00:00:51.353 --> 00:00:55.799
This is equal to x plus d-squared.

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:57.262
Now we can rewrite,

00:00:57.262 --> 00:00:59.863
x plus d-squared is going to be equal to

00:00:59.863 --> 00:01:01.982
x-squared plus

00:01:01.982 --> 00:01:06.982
two dx

00:01:08.032 --> 00:01:09.954
plus d-squared.

00:01:09.954 --> 00:01:12.544
If this step, right over
here, you find strange,

00:01:12.544 --> 00:01:14.689
I encourage you to watch the videos

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:19.689
on squaring binomials or on
perfect square polynomials,

00:01:19.739 --> 00:01:21.701
either one, so you can see the pattern

00:01:21.701 --> 00:01:23.186
that this is going to be.

00:01:23.186 --> 00:01:26.913
X squared plus two times the product

00:01:26.913 --> 00:01:30.372
of both of these terms plus d-squared.

00:01:30.372 --> 00:01:31.876
When you look at it like this,

00:01:31.876 --> 00:01:35.301
you can start to pattern
match a little bit.

00:01:35.301 --> 00:01:40.270
You can say, alright,
five x, right over here,

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.379
that is going to have
to be equal to two d,

00:01:44.379 --> 00:01:46.550
and then, you can also say,

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.511
that c is going to have
to be equal to d-squared.

00:01:51.981 --> 00:01:56.249
Once again, you can say
two d is equal to five,

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:58.229
two d is equal to five,

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:01.927
or that d is equal to five halves.

00:02:01.927 --> 00:02:04.551
We've figured out what d is equal to.

00:02:04.551 --> 00:02:06.431
Now we can figure out what c is,

00:02:06.431 --> 00:02:10.518
because we know that c needs
to be equal to d-squared,

00:02:10.518 --> 00:02:14.630
gimme that orange color, actually,

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.018
so we know that c is equal to d-squared,

00:02:18.018 --> 00:02:20.975
which is the same thing
as five halves, squared.

00:02:20.975 --> 00:02:22.708
We just figured out what d is equal to.

00:02:22.708 --> 00:02:24.577
Gonna be five halves, squared,

00:02:24.577 --> 00:02:27.885
which is going to be 25 over four.

00:02:27.885 --> 00:02:32.210
C is equal to

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.830
25 over four,

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.861
d is equal to five halves.

00:02:35.861 --> 00:02:37.184
We're done.
