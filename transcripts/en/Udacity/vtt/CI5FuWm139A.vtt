00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.696
And the answer is, that both of these functions have inverses. Here are their

00:00:04.696 --> 00:00:09.038
graphs and we can see, that they each pass the horizontal line test. Once

00:00:09.038 --> 00:00:12.660
again, here's the original function. H of x equals 2x squared with no

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.963
restrictions on the domain at all. So, even though this function doesn't have

00:00:16.963 --> 00:00:21.055
an inverse, because it doesn't pass the horizontal line test. And apparently,

00:00:21.055 --> 00:00:24.093
for some functions at least, if we change the domain of the function, we can

00:00:24.093 --> 00:00:28.405
influence whether or not it has an inverse. That's pretty neat, domain

00:00:28.405 --> 00:00:32.090
continues to be super powerful and really, really important to keep in mind.
