00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:02.070
Everyone loves a good lunar eclipse!

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.259
Especially people who think the moon is some
kind of push notification telling us the end

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:09.350
of days is comin'.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.639
UGH.

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:13.230
STOP IT.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.830
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:16.830
Happy Friday!

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.040
Trace here with your DNews Weekly Space update.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.200
The moon is our celestial partner, twirling
around us as we zoom around our star.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.390
It's a big hunk of rock, made of dust and
minerals with craters pock-marking its surface.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.500
It's a beauty, but it's NOT a harbinger of
death and destruction.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.330
Next Monday, we're going to have the first
of four lunar eclipses over the next two years.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.670
When they're grouped like this, astronomers
call them a tetrad -- which means a set of

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:41.670
four.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.710
Tetrads are four successive FULL eclipses
with no partial eclipses in between.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.951
Lunar eclipses are not as rare as you think,
UniverseToday points out there were 81 in

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:54.650
the 20th century alone, with 5 tetrads!

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.329
The 21st is going to have 85 eclipses and
8 tetrads!

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.920
There hasn't been eight since the 9th century!

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.920
Get PUMPED.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.469
A lot of those eclipses are partial eclipses,
but a FULL lunar eclipse happens when the

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:09.380
moon passes through the shadow of the Earth.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.689
It always happens during a full moon, because
that's the only time we're between the sun

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:14.689
and the moon.

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:18.920
The Earth is kinda fat, but not SO big as
to completely black out our astronomical BFF.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.340
Instead, it gets a rusty color.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.340
Why?

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.640
IS IT THE BLOOD MOON FROM REVELATION?

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.469
IS THE END NIGH?

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:27.469
LOL, REVELATION...

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:28.469
No.

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:29.469
It's not.

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:30.469
Where was I...

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:31.469
Right.

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:32.469
The moon's got red on it.

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:34.399
So, as the moon passes along the other side
of the Earth, our shadow will block the light

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:35.399
from the sun.

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:40.029
It won't appear totally black, because the
Earth is too far away and the sun is too bright.

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:43.920
When the sun's light hits our atmosphere,
the colors of light are scattered by all those

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.319
little air molecules.

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:50.399
Because of its long wavelength, red light
is scattered least, and so makes it through

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.320
our gas to hit the moon.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.029
It's the same reason the moon appears orange
when it's low in the sky, or sunsets are predominantly

00:01:57.029 --> 00:02:00.279
orange by the horizon and blue and purple
higher up.

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:05.409
The red light makes it through all those miles
of atmosphere to get to your eyes, while blue

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.489
scatters much higher.

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.069
Think of this full lunar eclipse like one
giant sunset!

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.650
Naming the moons is a tradition stretching
back to ancient history.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.620
Without electric lights the movement of the
stars, planets and our moon was observable

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.459
by everyone; so stories were told to explain
their movements.

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.349
A Blue Moon is two full moons in the same
calendar month.

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.799
Harvest moons appear nearest the autumnal
equinox, and the Hunter's Moon is the next

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:32.799
full moon after THAT.

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:37.209
Hunter's moons are also called the Blood Moon
because it was a good time to shoot migratory

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:38.209
birds.

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.400
The internet has turned it into this crazy
apocalyptic thing, but in reality, it's just

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.439
a beautiful sight for astronomers.

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:48.350
Want to add more pop cult sci fi to this?

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:55.349
Total lunar eclipses mean the Sun, Earth and
Moon are in ALIGNMENT OoOOOOooo!

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:56.500
That's called a Syzygy.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.900
It's a real word, and great for Scrabble.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.049
Plus, as an added treat, Mars will be to the
right of the moon too!

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.470
This eclipse on April 15th will be the first
of the next two year tetrad.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.290
If you're in Asia and Europe, sorry.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.330
Womp womp.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.730
But, if you're in North or South America we'll
be able to see it without a telescope, though

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.019
if you have one -- get it out, bro!

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.620
It should be spectacular views.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.500
The eclipse will start around midnight, Pacific
time.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.760
Have you ever seen an eclipse?

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.280
Are you going to see this one?!

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.629

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:34.140
Speaking of down below... birth controls are
pretty common now, and standardized.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.110
But before the pill people had NO IDEA WHAT
THEY WERE DOING.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:50.090
Some ladies were even stickin' lemons up there.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.370
Citrusy fresh, sure, but not much good at
contraception.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.379

control methods?

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:59.830
It's.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:00.830
Awesome.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:01.830
Really really good.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.189
You don't even know.
