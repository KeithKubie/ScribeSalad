00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.016
- [Instructor] So right over here

00:00:01.016 --> 00:00:03.623
we have the graph of y
is equal to x squared,

00:00:03.623 --> 00:00:06.496
or at least part of the graph
of y is equal to x squared.

00:00:06.496 --> 00:00:08.325
And the first thing I'd like to tackle is

00:00:08.325 --> 00:00:10.349
think about the average rate of change

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.334
of y with respect to x

00:00:12.334 --> 00:00:16.505
over the interval from x
equaling 1 to x equaling 3.

00:00:16.505 --> 00:00:18.168
So let me write that down.

00:00:18.168 --> 00:00:21.668
We want to know the average rate of change

00:00:24.011 --> 00:00:26.545
of y with respect to x

00:00:26.545 --> 00:00:30.897
over the interval from
x going from 1 to 3.

00:00:30.897 --> 00:00:32.039
And that's a closed interval,

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:35.299
where x could be 1, and
x could be equal to 3.

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:38.147
Well we could do this even
without looking at the graph.

00:00:38.147 --> 00:00:40.275
If I were to just make a table here,

00:00:40.275 --> 00:00:44.442
where, if this is x, and this
is y is equal to x squared,

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.004
when x is equal to 1, y
is equal to 1 squared,

00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:49.876
which is just 1.

00:00:49.876 --> 00:00:52.168
You see that right over there.

00:00:52.168 --> 00:00:55.068
And when x is equal to 3,

00:00:55.068 --> 00:00:58.498
y is equal to 3 squared,
which is equal to 9.

00:00:58.498 --> 00:01:01.976
And so you can see when x is equal to 3,

00:01:01.976 --> 00:01:03.559
y is equal to 9.

00:01:04.636 --> 00:01:06.743
And to figure out the
average rate of change

00:01:06.743 --> 00:01:08.476
of y with respect to x,

00:01:08.476 --> 00:01:10.610
you say, "Okay, well
what's my change in x?"

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:11.811
Well, we could see very clearly

00:01:11.811 --> 00:01:14.171
that our change in x over this interval

00:01:14.171 --> 00:01:16.409
is equal to positive 2.

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.909
Well, what's our change in
y over the same interval?

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.678
Our change in y is equal to ...

00:01:22.678 --> 00:01:25.599
When x increased by 2 from 1 to 3,

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:29.252
y increases by 8, so it's
going to be a positive 8.

00:01:29.252 --> 00:01:31.080
So what is our average rate of change?

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.670
Well, it's going to be our change in y,

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.503
or our change in x,

00:01:37.502 --> 00:01:41.669
which is equal to 8 over
2, which is equal to 4.

00:01:46.727 --> 00:01:49.383
So that would be our
average rate of change.

00:01:49.383 --> 00:01:52.013
Over that interval, on average,

00:01:52.013 --> 00:01:56.180
every time x increases by
1, y is increasing by 4.

00:01:57.515 --> 00:01:59.257
And how did we calculate that?

00:01:59.257 --> 00:02:01.129
We looked at our change in x,

00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:02.757
let me draw that here ...

00:02:02.757 --> 00:02:05.508
We looked at our change in x,

00:02:05.508 --> 00:02:08.258
and we looked at our change in y,

00:02:09.548 --> 00:02:12.700
which would be this right over here,

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.313
and we calculated change
in y over change of x

00:02:15.313 --> 00:02:17.533
for average rate of change.

00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:20.084
Now this might be looking
fairly familiar to you,

00:02:20.084 --> 00:02:21.155
because you're used to thinking about

00:02:21.155 --> 00:02:23.419
change in y over change in x

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:27.651
as the slope of a line
connecting two points.

00:02:27.651 --> 00:02:30.499
And that's indeed what we did calculate.

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:34.666
If you were to draw a secant
line between these two points,

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.560
we essentially just calculated

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.190
the slope of that secant line.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.317
And so the average rate of
change between two points,

00:02:44.317 --> 00:02:48.484
that is the same thing as
the slope of the secant line.

00:02:49.385 --> 00:02:51.266
And by looking at the secant line,

00:02:51.266 --> 00:02:54.148
in comparison to the
curve over that interval,

00:02:54.148 --> 00:02:55.898
it hopefully gives you a visual intuition

00:02:55.898 --> 00:02:58.719
for what even average
rate of change means.

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:01.105
Because in the beginning
part of the interval,

00:03:01.105 --> 00:03:02.464
you see that the secant line

00:03:02.464 --> 00:03:04.693
is actually increasing at a faster rate,

00:03:04.693 --> 00:03:06.696
but then as we get closer to 3,

00:03:06.696 --> 00:03:08.367
it looks like our yellow curve

00:03:08.367 --> 00:03:10.840
is increasing at a faster
rate than the secant line,

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.852
and then they eventually catch up.

00:03:12.852 --> 00:03:14.872
And so that's why the
slope of the secant line

00:03:14.872 --> 00:03:16.605
is the average rate of change.

00:03:16.605 --> 00:03:18.276
Is it the exact rate of
change at every point?

00:03:18.276 --> 00:03:19.600
Absolutely not.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.447
The curve's rate of change
is constantly changing.

00:03:22.447 --> 00:03:23.910
It's at a slower rate of change

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.512
in the beginning part of this interval,

00:03:25.512 --> 00:03:28.307
and then it's actually
increasing at a higher rate

00:03:28.307 --> 00:03:30.177
as we get closer and closer to three.

00:03:30.177 --> 00:03:31.910
So over the interval,

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.577
the change in y over the change
in x is exactly the same.

00:03:36.577 --> 00:03:39.085
Now one question you might be wondering is

00:03:39.085 --> 00:03:41.462
why are you learning this
is in a calculus class?

00:03:41.462 --> 00:03:44.179
Couldn't you have learned
this in an algebra class?

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:45.564
The answer is yes.

00:03:45.564 --> 00:03:47.009
But what's going to be interesting,

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:50.818
and is really one of the
foundational ideas of calculus is

00:03:50.818 --> 00:03:52.620
well what happens as these points

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.501
get closer and closer together?

00:03:54.501 --> 00:03:57.653
We found the average rate
of change between 1 and 3,

00:03:57.653 --> 00:04:01.820
or the slope of the secant
line from (1, 1) to (3, 9).

00:04:03.352 --> 00:04:06.487
But what instead if you found
the slope of the secant line

00:04:06.487 --> 00:04:10.570
between (2, 4) and (3, 9)?

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.113
So what if you found this slope?

00:04:13.113 --> 00:04:15.055
But what if you wanted to get even closer?

00:04:15.055 --> 00:04:17.519
Let's say you wanted to find
the slope of the secant line

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.936
between the point

00:04:20.434 --> 00:04:22.851
(2.5, 6.25)

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.233
and (3, 9)?

00:04:26.233 --> 00:04:27.574
And what if you just kept getting

00:04:27.574 --> 00:04:29.838
closer and closer and closer?

00:04:29.838 --> 00:04:32.398
Well then, the slopes
of these secant lines

00:04:32.398 --> 00:04:34.078
are going to get closer and closer

00:04:34.078 --> 00:04:38.589
to the slope of the
tangent line at x equals 3.

00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:41.506
And if we can figure out the
slope of the tangent line,

00:04:41.506 --> 00:04:43.012
well then we're in business.

00:04:43.012 --> 00:04:45.651
Because then we're not talking
about average rate of change,

00:04:45.651 --> 00:04:46.678
we're going to be talking about

00:04:46.678 --> 00:04:48.933
instantaneous rate of change,

00:04:48.933 --> 00:04:50.762
which is one of the central ideas,

00:04:50.762 --> 00:04:52.495
that is the derivative,

00:04:52.495 --> 00:04:54.045
and we're going to get there soon.

00:04:54.045 --> 00:04:55.856
But it's really important to appreciate

00:04:55.856 --> 00:04:58.468
that average rate of
change between two points

00:04:58.468 --> 00:05:00.802
is the same thing as the
slope of the secant line.

00:05:00.802 --> 00:05:03.283
And as those points get
closer and closer together,

00:05:03.283 --> 00:05:05.216
and as the secant line is connecting

00:05:05.216 --> 00:05:07.384
two closer and closer points together,

00:05:07.384 --> 00:05:10.005
that distance between the points,

00:05:10.005 --> 00:05:12.618
between the x values of
the points approach 0,

00:05:12.618 --> 00:05:16.043
very interesting things
are going to happen.
