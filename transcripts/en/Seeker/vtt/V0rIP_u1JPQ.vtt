00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:07.229
You’re looking at a 3D bioprinted lung-mimicking
air sac, that’s able to pump air into airways,

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:11.190
mimic blood flow and was built using living
cells.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.339
Granted it’s smaller than a penny, but this
lung-mimicking air sac could bring us one

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:19.630
step closer to understanding how we could
replicate human organs using a patient’s

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.849
cells which could one day help to avoid organ
rejection.

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.119
The team behind this model is trying to replicate
the complicated architectural structures of

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.000
our organs using 3D bioprinting and used the
lung as their proof of concept.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.380
Jordan: “It is a very complicated structure,
yet it has extremely clear readouts for its

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.380
function.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.520
If we have a mimic of lung tissue, we can
pump in deoxygenated red blood cells.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.800
We can ventilate in the airway oxygen, and
we can see to what extent those red blood

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.920
cells will take up the oxygen that we've been
putting into the air sac.”

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.360
Being able to print multiple independent vessel
architectures has been one of the biggest

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.640
challenges in the world of artificial organs.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.429
That’s because our organs are, well, pretty
complicated.

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:11.340
You see, each tissue has its own knotted mess
of blood vessels, which are physically and

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.570
biochemically mixed.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.270
And they serve crucial purposes by supplying
organs with essential nutrients.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.429
Take the liver for example.

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:23.950
It has over 500 functions, like producing
bile for digestion and maintaining the right

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.040
amounts of blood sugar within the body.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.140
All these functions depend on the intricate
network of vessels to get their necessary

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.140
nutrients.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.189
It’s this multi-vascular architecture that
makes mimicking and replicating human organs

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:37.189
so difficult.

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.630
If we could figure it out, the payoff would
be huge.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.920
Over 100,000 people are waiting for organs
in the U.S. and bioprinting healthy organs

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.789
could be a way to address this shortage by
supplying replacement organs.

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.829
It could also reduce the incidents of organ
rejection since bioprinted organs would contain

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:56.570
the patient’s own cells.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.420
But, working with living cells isn’t easy.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.389
They’re extremely fragile outside of the
body and once they’ve been extracted, they

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:08.500
need to be placed into their final structure
as quickly as possible to ensure survival.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.010
The cells are then encapsulated within a hydrogel,
a water-based material which emulates a cell’s

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.690
environment, to allow them to survive for
longer periods.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.450
So how did Jordan and his team print the lung
model?

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.930
They used a technique called stereolithography
apparatus for tissue engineering, or SLATE.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.580
It’s an open-source bioprinting technology
that uses additive manufacturing to create

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.220
soft hydrogels layer-by-layer by using light
from a digital projector.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.110
So this is a light-based polymerization system.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:44.080
So we have a light-sensitive liquid, that
when you shine the right color of light at

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.790
the right intensity of energy, the right number
of photons hit that sample, you can convert

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.490
that liquid into a solid only in that region.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.540
But using light also created some issues,
since the light could get into previously

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.970
solidified layers, thus disrupting the intended
pattern.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.260
To address this, the team searched to find
an element that could block light and that

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.820
was biocompatible.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.310
And the winner was food dye.
Jordan: “These biocompatible food additives

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.450
that all of us are eating all the time anyway,
we already know that they're biocompatible.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:22.340
They're compatible with live cells, and they
can be used as potent photo absorbers to block

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.350
the light penetrating previous layers, getting
us our complex architecture.”

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:33.290
The food dyes were able to confine the solidification
to a thin layer, creating the desired internal

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.290
structures.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.370
In the end, these tissues proved to be sturdy
enough to withstand blood flow and pulsating

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.300
breathing, the rhythm that mimics the pressures
and frequencies of how we breathe.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.440
So this model may be tiny,
but it’s just the beginning for Jordan and

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.440
his team.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.590
They plan to make more complex designs and
scale them up.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.460
And in the spirit of teamwork and advancing
research, they’ve made their work’s source

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.090
data freely available.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.190
Jordan: “We're using open-source to be able
to make the 3D printer, we're giving back

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.390
to the open-source community our designs.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:09.691
But I think scientists in general, get a little
bit nervous about releasing things into the

00:04:09.691 --> 00:04:13.940
open, because they're like, "Well, what are
people going to use this for?

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:14.940
I don't really know."

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.909
You actually want to open-source your stuff
because you don't know what people are going

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:19.999
to use it for.

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:24.979
And that's really the power behind open-source,
and it's really the power behind science.”

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:29.650
And thanks to collaborative efforts like these,
we’ll one day be able to 3D bioprint organs

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.820
to help address the organ shortage.
