00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.133
Humans and animals
are hardwired to endure

00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:05.533
and that includes our
"Hostile Planet" crew

00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:08.000
who had to go through
so much to bring

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.867
you this incredible footage.

00:00:10.867 --> 00:00:13.767
RENEE GODFREY: We were filming
the bat sequence in New Mexico

00:00:13.767 --> 00:00:16.166
in the middle of the
baking hot desert

00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:19.467
to capture this amazing
emergence of thousands

00:00:19.467 --> 00:00:23.200
of bats in the evening light.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.066
MARK MACEWAN: They snake
out of these huge caves.

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.300
But-- well, that's
great and they look

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.500
great when they're doing that.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.967
But you don't want
to be in the cave

00:00:28.967 --> 00:00:31.133
when they're doing that
because in the cave is hideous.

00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:32.467
You're in there.

00:00:32.467 --> 00:00:35.567
And you are just being
rained on with bat feces

00:00:35.567 --> 00:00:38.100
and urine all over the place.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.700
When that's not
happening, there are

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.667
flesh-eating beetles falling off
the ceiling trying to bite you.

00:00:43.667 --> 00:00:45.900
You look at the floor
and it's crawling

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.600
with maggots and beetle larvae.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.500
It's like Mordor.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.433
And the ammonia is
ridiculously strong.

00:00:54.433 --> 00:00:57.400
If we wander in there, I will
die within minutes if I'm not

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.633
wearing a full
respirator kit, which

00:00:59.633 --> 00:01:02.100
in the middle of the
desert in 100% humidity

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.467
is the last thing
you really want.

00:01:03.467 --> 00:01:05.233
The visor is filling with sweat.

00:01:05.233 --> 00:01:06.633
It's like in a
leaky diving mask.

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:07.467
OK.

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:08.734
Now, for the surgical gloves.

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:10.100
There's a massive
amount of preparation

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.000
before going into the bat cave.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.266
It's to protect ourselves.

00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:15.200
But it's also to stop
us taking anything

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.734
in that could impact
or contaminate

00:01:17.734 --> 00:01:19.667
the bats' environment.

00:01:19.667 --> 00:01:21.867
It's just this crazy
ritual every day

00:01:21.867 --> 00:01:24.700
that we had to do if we
wanted to go into the cave.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.900
The snake test.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.500
MARK MACEWAN: The cave
that these bats live in is

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.266
in a very steep-sided gorge.

00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:32.066
And climbing down there
is sort of snake alley.

00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:33.500
We'd have to throw
stones everywhere

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.767
to try and give it a warning
that we're coming down.

00:01:36.767 --> 00:01:39.934
You crawl down into these
huge, steep cave systems

00:01:39.934 --> 00:01:41.567
in these suits
that you can't tear

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:43.300
or have any imperfections in.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.133
And suddenly, you realized
you were going somewhere that

00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:47.166
wasn't really meant for you.

00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:48.467
RENEE GODFREY: It's
like walking on snow.

00:01:48.467 --> 00:01:51.367
You're walking in on
big piles of guano.

00:01:51.367 --> 00:01:53.100
You can see why you need
to wear the respirators

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.400
because with each
footstep, a cloud of dust

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.333
comes up from the dry powder.

00:01:58.333 --> 00:01:59.900
MARK MACEWAN: So
we'd have this moment

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.233
where we've set all the cameras
and we'd sit and we'd wait.

00:02:02.233 --> 00:02:04.300
If we got lucky, they'd
come out, but only

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.500
for probably 10 minutes.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.266
The whole event is
over in 10 minutes.

00:02:08.266 --> 00:02:09.500
RENEE GODFREY: It
is extraordinary

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.100
as they shoot out past you.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.633
You just get this rush of air
and this flap of their wings,

00:02:14.633 --> 00:02:16.133
which I know we captured
with the Phantom

00:02:16.133 --> 00:02:19.200
at 1,000 frames a
second beautifully.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.867
MARK MACEWAN: What
we were after was

00:02:20.867 --> 00:02:23.166
bats being predated by hawks.

00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:25.400
And these hawks come
flying in from nowhere

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.834
and are just picking
bats out of the sky.

00:02:27.834 --> 00:02:29.934
And what we were kind of
really interested in in sort

00:02:29.934 --> 00:02:31.700
of the movement into
shots and trying

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.834
to use high-speed
technology to really capture

00:02:34.834 --> 00:02:36.133
the moment of the capture.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.100

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.633
RENEE GODFREY: The bat
cave in New Mexico,

00:02:42.633 --> 00:02:44.700
it's not the most glamorous
of environments to work in,

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.100
that's for sure.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.700
But then the bats start to swirl
out as the evening light begins

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.834
and suddenly you see
this amazing spectacle

00:02:52.834 --> 00:02:54.300
happening before your eyes.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.767
And it makes it worth it.

00:02:55.767 --> 00:02:58.233
