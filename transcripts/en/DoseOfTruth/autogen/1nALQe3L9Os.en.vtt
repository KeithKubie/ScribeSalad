I was exposed my ideas were exposed to a
 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.510
I was exposed my ideas were exposed to a
large number of people tens of thousands

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520
large number of people tens of thousands
 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.160
large number of people tens of thousands
of people as a consequence of that and

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170
of people as a consequence of that and
 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.889
of people as a consequence of that and
that seemed to go pretty well and so

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899
that seemed to go pretty well and so
 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.119
that seemed to go pretty well and so
then YouTube came along and I thought

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129
then YouTube came along and I thought
 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.260
then YouTube came along and I thought
well I don't know what this is this

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270

was a lot of well there were a lot of
 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.010
was a lot of well there were a lot of
things that it would be easy to be

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020
things that it would be easy to be
 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.080
things that it would be easy to be
contemptuous of on YouTube like the

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090
contemptuous of on YouTube like the
 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.899
contemptuous of on YouTube like the
canonical cute cat videos but I'm

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909
canonical cute cat videos but I'm
 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.420
canonical cute cat videos but I'm
actually not so contemptuous of that or

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430
actually not so contemptuous of that or
 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.760
actually not so contemptuous of that or
the interesting animal videos because I

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770
the interesting animal videos because I
 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.859
the interesting animal videos because I
think they actually speak to a part of

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869
think they actually speak to a part of
 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.929
think they actually speak to a part of
people that's actually quite good we

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939
people that's actually quite good we
 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.940
people that's actually quite good we
like cats we like dogs we think animals

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950
like cats we like dogs we think animals
 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.800
like cats we like dogs we think animals
are kind of cool and you know we take a

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810
are kind of cool and you know we take a
 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.719
are kind of cool and you know we take a
break and look at look at something

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729
break and look at look at something
 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.340
break and look at look at something
that's Pleasant and cute and maybe

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350
that's Pleasant and cute and maybe
 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.190
that's Pleasant and cute and maybe
that's not so bad it's not serious but

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200
that's not so bad it's not serious but
 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.990
that's not so bad it's not serious but
it's certainly not malevolent and that's

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000
it's certainly not malevolent and that's
 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.340
it's certainly not malevolent and that's
something so I thought okay well I'll

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350
something so I thought okay well I'll
 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.399
something so I thought okay well I'll
find these old videos I did for TV oh

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409
find these old videos I did for TV oh
 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.899
find these old videos I did for TV oh
and I'll put them up on YouTube and

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909
and I'll put them up on YouTube and
 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.789
and I'll put them up on YouTube and
maybe I'll just tape my classes and so I

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799
maybe I'll just tape my classes and so I
 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.800
maybe I'll just tape my classes and so I
set up because I have this theory that

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810
set up because I have this theory that
 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.270
set up because I have this theory that
if it's worth doing it's worth doing

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280
if it's worth doing it's worth doing
 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.960
if it's worth doing it's worth doing
badly which you know it's true but it's

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970
badly which you know it's true but it's
 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.550
badly which you know it's true but it's
also true that if it's worth doing it's

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560
also true that if it's worth doing it's
 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.319
also true that if it's worth doing it's
worth doing well you just need to know

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329
worth doing well you just need to know
 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.539
worth doing well you just need to know
when to apply those two principles and

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549
when to apply those two principles and
 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.240
when to apply those two principles and
if you're loathe to do something and

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250
if you're loathe to do something and
 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.950
if you're loathe to do something and
procrastinating then sometimes it's

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960
procrastinating then sometimes it's
 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.660
procrastinating then sometimes it's
better to do it badly and I thought well

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670
better to do it badly and I thought well
 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.940
better to do it badly and I thought well
I can't get a whole production studio up

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950
I can't get a whole production studio up
 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.469
I can't get a whole production studio up
and running and because I just don't

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479
and running and because I just don't
 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.200
and running and because I just don't
have the time I'll get an iPad and learn

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210
have the time I'll get an iPad and learn
 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.420
have the time I'll get an iPad and learn
to use it and get a lavalier mic and

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430
to use it and get a lavalier mic and
 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.850
to use it and get a lavalier mic and
just set the thing up or maybe have a

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860
just set the thing up or maybe have a
 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.490
just set the thing up or maybe have a
student film it and so I did that for a

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500
student film it and so I did that for a
 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.280
student film it and so I did that for a
couple of years for my personality class

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290
couple of years for my personality class
 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.850
couple of years for my personality class
in this

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860
in this
 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.710
in this
meaning class which is the class where I

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720
meaning class which is the class where I
 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.330
meaning class which is the class where I
outlined the sorts of ideas that I just

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340
outlined the sorts of ideas that I just
 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.670
outlined the sorts of ideas that I just
described to you and last April I

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680
described to you and last April I
 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.410
described to you and last April I
noticed that I'd had a million views and

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420
noticed that I'd had a million views and
 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.720
noticed that I'd had a million views and
about 15,000 subscribers no one I

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730
about 15,000 subscribers no one I
 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.380
about 15,000 subscribers no one I
thought huh million views eh that's

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390
thought huh million views eh that's
 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.780
thought huh million views eh that's
actually a lot of views it's like if I

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790
actually a lot of views it's like if I
 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.670
actually a lot of views it's like if I
have never write a scientific paper

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680
have never write a scientific paper
 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.770
have never write a scientific paper
that's been read a million times no one

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780
that's been read a million times no one
 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.930
that's been read a million times no one
has that just never happens right so

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940
has that just never happens right so
 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.930
has that just never happens right so
that's happens zero times if it if you

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940
that's happens zero times if it if you
 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.670
that's happens zero times if it if you
have a paper that's cited you know

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680
have a paper that's cited you know
 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.080
have a paper that's cited you know
someone else refers to it and one of

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090
someone else refers to it and one of
 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.940
someone else refers to it and one of
their scientific papers a hundred times

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950
their scientific papers a hundred times
 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.220
their scientific papers a hundred times
it's like that's a home run and a

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230
it's like that's a home run and a
 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.400
it's like that's a home run and a
thousand times is a miracle so and then

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410
thousand times is a miracle so and then
 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.630
thousand times is a miracle so and then
if you write a book you know there's

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640
if you write a book you know there's
 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.270
if you write a book you know there's
think 1.2 million books published last

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280
think 1.2 million books published last
 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.670
think 1.2 million books published last
year something like that and I think 500

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680
year something like that and I think 500
 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.780
year something like that and I think 500
of them sold more than a hundred

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790
of them sold more than a hundred
 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.810
of them sold more than a hundred
thousand copies so that's a sea of books

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820
thousand copies so that's a sea of books
 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.750
thousand copies so that's a sea of books
right it's an ocean of books and all of

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760
right it's an ocean of books and all of
 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.840
right it's an ocean of books and all of
them fail really so so many of them fail

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850
them fail really so so many of them fail
 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.010
them fail really so so many of them fail
that you might as well never write a

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020
that you might as well never write a
 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.230
that you might as well never write a
book because the probability that it

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240
book because the probability that it
 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.280
book because the probability that it
will fail is like 99.99% and that would

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290
will fail is like 99.99% and that would
 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.870
will fail is like 99.99% and that would
be very depressing if it wasn't the case

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880
be very depressing if it wasn't the case
 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.190
be very depressing if it wasn't the case
that that's the case for anything

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200
that that's the case for anything
 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.320
that that's the case for anything
creative you ever do so it's just

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330
creative you ever do so it's just
 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.990
creative you ever do so it's just
baseline probability but I thought well

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000
baseline probability but I thought well
 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.430
baseline probability but I thought well
if I wrote a book and it sold a million

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440
if I wrote a book and it sold a million
 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.259
if I wrote a book and it sold a million
copies man I'd be out dancing in the

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269
copies man I'd be out dancing in the
 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.650
copies man I'd be out dancing in the
street probably not but you know you get

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660
street probably not but you know you get
 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.690
street probably not but you know you get
the idea so what does it mean to have a

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700
the idea so what does it mean to have a
 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.479
the idea so what does it mean to have a
million YouTube views well who the hell

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489
million YouTube views well who the hell
 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.240
million YouTube views well who the hell
knows right I mean we don't have metrics

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250
knows right I mean we don't have metrics
 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.560
knows right I mean we don't have metrics
for that we don't know what sort of

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570
for that we don't know what sort of
 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.360
for that we don't know what sort of
influence that's having we don't know

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370
influence that's having we don't know
 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.800
influence that's having we don't know
anything about that we don't know

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810
anything about that we don't know
 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.270
anything about that we don't know
whether we should take it seriously or

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280
whether we should take it seriously or
 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.759
whether we should take it seriously or
or if it's or who you're talking to or

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769
or if it's or who you're talking to or
 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.280
or if it's or who you're talking to or
anything but I thought well still it's a

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290
anything but I thought well still it's a
 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.979
anything but I thought well still it's a
million and that's a lot and I thought

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989
million and that's a lot and I thought
 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.320
million and that's a lot and I thought
well maybe this is this is more serious

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330
well maybe this is this is more serious
 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.940
well maybe this is this is more serious
thing than I initially envisioned and

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950
thing than I initially envisioned and
 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.140
thing than I initially envisioned and
then I really thought about it and I

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150
then I really thought about it and I
 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.520
then I really thought about it and I
thought oh I get it here's a hypothesis

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530
thought oh I get it here's a hypothesis
 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.670
thought oh I get it here's a hypothesis
you know back in the medieval times and

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680
you know back in the medieval times and
 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.290
you know back in the medieval times and
before if if you wanted a book someone

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300
before if if you wanted a book someone
 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.080
before if if you wanted a book someone
had to copy it by hand and so there

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090
had to copy it by hand and so there
 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.550
had to copy it by hand and so there
weren't many books and they were very

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560
weren't many books and they were very
 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.400
weren't many books and they were very
expensive and so and then Gutenberg came

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410
expensive and so and then Gutenberg came
 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.990
expensive and so and then Gutenberg came
along and invented the movable type

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000
along and invented the movable type
 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.380
along and invented the movable type
press and it was like poof books were

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390
press and it was like poof books were
 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.460
press and it was like poof books were
inexpensive and everybody could have

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470
inexpensive and everybody could have
 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.870
inexpensive and everybody could have
them and not like was that was a major

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880
them and not like was that was a major
 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.000
them and not like was that was a major
revolution right within four hundred

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010
revolution right within four hundred
 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.320
revolution right within four hundred
years almost every

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330
years almost every
 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.180
years almost every
in the western world and then very

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190
in the western world and then very
 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.219
in the western world and then very
rapidly almost everyone in the entire

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229
rapidly almost everyone in the entire
 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.409
rapidly almost everyone in the entire
world was literate and could read

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419
world was literate and could read
 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.480
world was literate and could read
silently even which was something that

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490
silently even which was something that
 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.399
silently even which was something that
before that was reserved for a very

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:37.409
before that was reserved for a very
 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:38.749
before that was reserved for a very
small number of people because most

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759
small number of people because most
 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:40.399
small number of people because most
people read out loud when they read at

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:40.409
people read out loud when they read at
 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:43.399
people read out loud when they read at
all so that was a massive revolution and

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:43.409
all so that was a massive revolution and
 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:46.279
all so that was a massive revolution and
then I thought wait a minute maybe

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289
then I thought wait a minute maybe
 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:49.180
then I thought wait a minute maybe
YouTube is a Gutenberg revolution

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190
YouTube is a Gutenberg revolution
 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.219
YouTube is a Gutenberg revolution
because it allows the spoken word to

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229
because it allows the spoken word to
 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:55.339
because it allows the spoken word to
have the same reach and longevity as a

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:55.349
have the same reach and longevity as a
 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:05:00.010
have the same reach and longevity as a
book for the first time in human history

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020
book for the first time in human history
 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.230
book for the first time in human history
spontaneous speeches can reach an

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240
spontaneous speeches can reach an
 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.930
spontaneous speeches can reach an
infinite audience for a for an

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940
infinite audience for a for an
 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.350
infinite audience for a for an
unspecified duration of time well that's

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360
unspecified duration of time well that's
 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.909
unspecified duration of time well that's
a whole new thing that's a that's an

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919
a whole new thing that's a that's an
 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:13.580
a whole new thing that's a that's an
entirely new thing and maybe it's easier

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590
entirely new thing and maybe it's easier
 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.469
entirely new thing and maybe it's easier
for people to listen than it is for them

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479
for people to listen than it is for them
 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:18.200
for people to listen than it is for them
to read you know I mean I'd rather read

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210
to read you know I mean I'd rather read
 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.459
to read you know I mean I'd rather read
than listen because I can read way

00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:19.469
than listen because I can read way
 

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:21.709
than listen because I can read way
faster than I can listen but people will

00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:21.719
faster than I can listen but people will
 

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:23.510
faster than I can listen but people will
listen to a YouTube video at twice the

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520
listen to a YouTube video at twice the
 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.999
listen to a YouTube video at twice the
normal speed sometimes more so you can

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:26.009
normal speed sometimes more so you can
 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:29.059
normal speed sometimes more so you can
circumvent that and then also with a

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:29.069
circumvent that and then also with a
 

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:31.249
circumvent that and then also with a
youtube video if you convert it into a

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:31.259
youtube video if you convert it into a
 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:33.230
youtube video if you convert it into a
podcast let's say which I'll get to to a

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240
podcast let's say which I'll get to to a
 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.629
podcast let's say which I'll get to to a
moment you all of a sudden have way more

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639
moment you all of a sudden have way more
 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:38.300
moment you all of a sudden have way more
time than you used to have because you

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310
time than you used to have because you
 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.399
time than you used to have because you
can listen to a podcast while you're

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:40.409
can listen to a podcast while you're
 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:42.740
can listen to a podcast while you're
doing other things so you can do mundane

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750
doing other things so you can do mundane
 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.330
doing other things so you can do mundane
the mundane things that you have to do

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340
the mundane things that you have to do
 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.490
the mundane things that you have to do
from day to day like commute and so on

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500
from day to day like commute and so on
 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.519
from day to day like commute and so on
but you can listen to a podcast and I've

00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:49.529
but you can listen to a podcast and I've
 

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:51.589
but you can listen to a podcast and I've
found that my students my young students

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:51.599
found that my students my young students
 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:54.800
found that my students my young students
are now listening to podcasts instead of

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810
are now listening to podcasts instead of
 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.439
are now listening to podcasts instead of
music and that's really something you

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:57.449
music and that's really something you
 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:05:59.119
music and that's really something you
know because music of course has been an

00:05:59.119 --> 00:05:59.129
know because music of course has been an
 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:02.240
know because music of course has been an
unbelievably dynamic cultural force for

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250
unbelievably dynamic cultural force for
 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.029
unbelievably dynamic cultural force for
maybe the the primary artistic cultural

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039
maybe the the primary artistic cultural
 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:08.930
maybe the the primary artistic cultural
force for what maybe maybe since the

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940
force for what maybe maybe since the
 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.450
force for what maybe maybe since the
1950s anyways and that's being

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460
1950s anyways and that's being
 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.909
1950s anyways and that's being
supplanted to some degree by podcasts

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919
supplanted to some degree by podcasts
 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:15.649
supplanted to some degree by podcasts
and that's really something and then it

00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:15.659
and that's really something and then it
 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:17.200
and that's really something and then it
also turns out that people have an

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210
also turns out that people have an
 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.600
also turns out that people have an
appetite for long detailed podcasts that

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610
appetite for long detailed podcasts that
 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.809
appetite for long detailed podcasts that
are deep and informative it's like who

00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:23.819
are deep and informative it's like who
 

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:25.580
are deep and informative it's like who
the hell would have guessed that like no

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:25.590
the hell would have guessed that like no
 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.890
the hell would have guessed that like no
one it's it just sort of came out of

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900
one it's it just sort of came out of
 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:28.610
one it's it just sort of came out of
nowhere

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620
nowhere
 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.830
nowhere
and so I thought well maybe this is

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840
and so I thought well maybe this is
 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.770
and so I thought well maybe this is
worth taking seriously
