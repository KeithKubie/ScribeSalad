00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
good afternoon so today we are going to

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110
good afternoon so today we are going to
 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.519
good afternoon so today we are going to
talk about this unusual family of

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529
talk about this unusual family of
 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.799
talk about this unusual family of
viruses that undergo reverse

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809
viruses that undergo reverse
 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.440
viruses that undergo reverse
transcription so we're going to talk

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450
transcription so we're going to talk
 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.120
transcription so we're going to talk
about the process by which reverse

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130
about the process by which reverse
 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.580
about the process by which reverse
transcriptions occur and integration of

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590
transcriptions occur and integration of
 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.050
transcriptions occur and integration of
the DNA into the genome and this began

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060
the DNA into the genome and this began
 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.130
the DNA into the genome and this began
at the very beginning of the 20th

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140
at the very beginning of the 20th
 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.220
at the very beginning of the 20th
century with two observations one in

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230
century with two observations one in
 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.060
century with two observations one in
1908 by that to investigators the

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070
1908 by that to investigators the
 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.600
1908 by that to investigators the
discovery of a virus that caused

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610
discovery of a virus that caused
 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.970
discovery of a virus that caused
leukemia and chickens remember 1908 not

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980
leukemia and chickens remember 1908 not
 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.069
leukemia and chickens remember 1908 not
long after viruses were first discovered

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079
long after viruses were first discovered
 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.560
long after viruses were first discovered
based they found a virus a filterable

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570
based they found a virus a filterable
 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.049
based they found a virus a filterable
agent which could cause leukemia in

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059
agent which could cause leukemia in
 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.319
agent which could cause leukemia in
chickens and then a couple years later

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329
chickens and then a couple years later
 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:50.750
chickens and then a couple years later
also in chickens the discovery of a

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760
also in chickens the discovery of a
 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.600
also in chickens the discovery of a
virus that causes sarcomas a certain

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610
virus that causes sarcomas a certain
 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.729
virus that causes sarcomas a certain
another type of tumor a solid tumor as

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739
another type of tumor a solid tumor as
 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.490
another type of tumor a solid tumor as
opposed to a leukemia a malignancy of

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500
opposed to a leukemia a malignancy of
 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.580
opposed to a leukemia a malignancy of
blood cells and that was done by peyton

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590
blood cells and that was done by peyton
 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.840
blood cells and that was done by peyton
rous and we'll visit him again in a few

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850
rous and we'll visit him again in a few
 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.300
rous and we'll visit him again in a few
weeks to talk about the implications of

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310
weeks to talk about the implications of
 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.210
weeks to talk about the implications of
that discovery eventually these two

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220
that discovery eventually these two
 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.179
that discovery eventually these two
viruses were called tumor viruses

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189
viruses were called tumor viruses
 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.350
viruses were called tumor viruses
because they cause tumors and at some

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360
because they cause tumors and at some
 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.039
because they cause tumors and at some
point they were found to contain an RNA

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049
point they were found to contain an RNA
 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.399
point they were found to contain an RNA
genome so tumor viruses RNA genomes came

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409
genome so tumor viruses RNA genomes came
 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.740
genome so tumor viruses RNA genomes came
many years later because if you remember

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750
many years later because if you remember
 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.590
many years later because if you remember
we didn't even know what the genetic

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600
we didn't even know what the genetic
 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.800
we didn't even know what the genetic
material was at least for DNA until the

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810
material was at least for DNA until the
 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.609
material was at least for DNA until the
40s and then RNA until the 1950s so

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619
40s and then RNA until the 1950s so
 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.450
40s and then RNA until the 1950s so
these tumor viruses had RNA genomes and

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460
these tumor viruses had RNA genomes and
 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.010
these tumor viruses had RNA genomes and
the puzzling question was how could they

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020
the puzzling question was how could they
 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.410
the puzzling question was how could they
transform cells such transformation as

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420
transform cells such transformation as
 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.840
transform cells such transformation as
we'll see later on is the process by

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850
we'll see later on is the process by
 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.630
we'll see later on is the process by
which you transform a cell so it becomes

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640
which you transform a cell so it becomes
 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.940
which you transform a cell so it becomes
immortal and has other properties as

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950
immortal and has other properties as
 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.319
immortal and has other properties as
well we'll talk about that in more

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329
well we'll talk about that in more
 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.749
well we'll talk about that in more
detail so these viruses could transform

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759
detail so these viruses could transform
 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.120
detail so these viruses could transform
cells by causing tumors leukemias or

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130
cells by causing tumors leukemias or
 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.039
cells by causing tumors leukemias or
sarcomas they could transform cells so

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049
sarcomas they could transform cells so
 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.550
sarcomas they could transform cells so
how could that do that finally in 1970

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560
how could that do that finally in 1970
 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.010
how could that do that finally in 1970
the enzyme within these particles was

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020
the enzyme within these particles was
 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.770
the enzyme within these particles was
discovered that carries out this reverse

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780
discovered that carries out this reverse
 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.260
discovered that carries out this reverse
transcription that was done by two

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270
transcription that was done by two
 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.790
transcription that was done by two
different investigators Howard

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800
different investigators Howard
 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.040
different investigators Howard
David Baltimore and five years later

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050
David Baltimore and five years later
 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.930
David Baltimore and five years later
they get they got the Nobel Prize for

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940
they get they got the Nobel Prize for
 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.660
they get they got the Nobel Prize for
that work so let's look a little bit at

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670
that work so let's look a little bit at
 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.820
that work so let's look a little bit at
this in detail reverse transcriptase was

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830
this in detail reverse transcriptase was
 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.590
this in detail reverse transcriptase was
an enzyme discovered in these tumor

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600
an enzyme discovered in these tumor
 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.870
an enzyme discovered in these tumor
viruses these are any tumor viruses

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880
viruses these are any tumor viruses
 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.300
viruses these are any tumor viruses
because there are also DNA tumor viruses

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310
because there are also DNA tumor viruses
 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.070
because there are also DNA tumor viruses
which we're not talking about today an

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080
which we're not talking about today an
 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.900
which we're not talking about today an
enzyme that seemed to counter the

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910
enzyme that seemed to counter the
 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.600
enzyme that seemed to counter the
central dogma which by the 70s was well

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610
central dogma which by the 70s was well
 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.940
central dogma which by the 70s was well
established that you have DNA is the

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950
established that you have DNA is the
 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.550
established that you have DNA is the
genetic material that makes RNA which

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560
genetic material that makes RNA which
 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.990
genetic material that makes RNA which
makes protein this is the flow of

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000
makes protein this is the flow of
 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.420
makes protein this is the flow of
genetic information suddenly these

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430
genetic information suddenly these
 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.610
genetic information suddenly these
viruses come along they have an enzyme

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620
viruses come along they have an enzyme
 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.210
viruses come along they have an enzyme
in the virus particle that can take RNA

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220
in the virus particle that can take RNA
 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.630
in the virus particle that can take RNA
and make DNA out of it so this was

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640
and make DNA out of it so this was
 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.660
and make DNA out of it so this was
believed to be contrary to the old dogma

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670
believed to be contrary to the old dogma
 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.120
believed to be contrary to the old dogma
so they were called retroviruses because

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130
so they were called retroviruses because
 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.880
so they were called retroviruses because
they can reverse the flow of genetic

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890
they can reverse the flow of genetic
 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.740
they can reverse the flow of genetic
information instead of DNA to RNA at

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750
information instead of DNA to RNA at
 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.110
information instead of DNA to RNA at
went from RNA to DNA so that's where the

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120
went from RNA to DNA so that's where the
 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.670
went from RNA to DNA so that's where the
name for this family comes from the

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680
name for this family comes from the
 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.300
name for this family comes from the
retro verdi or the retroviruses and

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310
retro verdi or the retroviruses and
 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.160
retro verdi or the retroviruses and
here's where they are on our Baltimore

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170
here's where they are on our Baltimore
 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.680
here's where they are on our Baltimore
scheme so now you know that this scheme

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690
scheme so now you know that this scheme
 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.150
scheme so now you know that this scheme
which was put together by David

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160
which was put together by David
 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.949
which was put together by David
Baltimore he was also the investigator

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959
Baltimore he was also the investigator
 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.350
Baltimore he was also the investigator
who one of the code discovers of the

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360
who one of the code discovers of the
 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.150
who one of the code discovers of the
reverse transcriptase who got the Nobel

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160
reverse transcriptase who got the Nobel
 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.390
reverse transcriptase who got the Nobel
Prize in 1975 remember there are seven

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400
Prize in 1975 remember there are seven
 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.220
Prize in 1975 remember there are seven
genome types and here are the

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230
genome types and here are the
 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.740
genome types and here are the
retroviruses their genome is positive

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750
retroviruses their genome is positive
 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.890
retroviruses their genome is positive
strand RNA but this goes through a DNA

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900
strand RNA but this goes through a DNA
 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.040
strand RNA but this goes through a DNA
intermediate to get to mRNA and we'll

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050
intermediate to get to mRNA and we'll
 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.360
intermediate to get to mRNA and we'll
talk about how that works today now

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370
talk about how that works today now
 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.130
talk about how that works today now
Howard teman had been working on these

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140
Howard teman had been working on these
 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.100
Howard teman had been working on these
RNA tumor viruses for many years and

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110
RNA tumor viruses for many years and
 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.900
RNA tumor viruses for many years and
what he found was when you infected

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910
what he found was when you infected
 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.180
what he found was when you infected
cells with them the cells were

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190
cells with them the cells were
 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.390
cells with them the cells were
permanently changed and so he his

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400
permanently changed and so he his
 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.130
permanently changed and so he his
hypothesis was that somehow these

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140
hypothesis was that somehow these
 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.010
hypothesis was that somehow these
viruses became a permanent resident in

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020
viruses became a permanent resident in
 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.620
viruses became a permanent resident in
the cell's genome and his theory arose

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630
the cell's genome and his theory arose
 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.550
the cell's genome and his theory arose
that the somehow the viral RNA is copied

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560
that the somehow the viral RNA is copied
 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.220
that the somehow the viral RNA is copied
into DNA which then gets integrated into

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230
into DNA which then gets integrated into
 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.500
into DNA which then gets integrated into
the host cell chromosome and he called

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510
the host cell chromosome and he called
 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.300
the host cell chromosome and he called
that the provirus this is called the

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310
that the provirus this is called the
 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.270
that the provirus this is called the
provirus hypothesis the idea that the

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280
provirus hypothesis the idea that the
 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.310
provirus hypothesis the idea that the
retroviruses these already tumor viruses

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320
retroviruses these already tumor viruses
 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.470
retroviruses these already tumor viruses
made DNA which integrated into the cell

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480
made DNA which integrated into the cell
 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.900
made DNA which integrated into the cell
so for many years it was a theory

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910
so for many years it was a theory
 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.630
so for many years it was a theory
because no one could find an enzyme that

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640
because no one could find an enzyme that
 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.210
because no one could find an enzyme that
could do this and in fact howard taman

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220
could do this and in fact howard taman
 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.440
could do this and in fact howard taman
tried for many years

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450
tried for many years
 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.750
tried for many years
he couldn't find an enzyme that would

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760
he couldn't find an enzyme that would
 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.870
he couldn't find an enzyme that would
take the viral RNA and copy it into DNA

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880
take the viral RNA and copy it into DNA
 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.240
take the viral RNA and copy it into DNA
but this is a necessary step of course

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250
but this is a necessary step of course
 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.610
but this is a necessary step of course
if you want this virus genetic

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620
if you want this virus genetic
 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.080
if you want this virus genetic
information to become a permanent part

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090
information to become a permanent part
 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.450
information to become a permanent part
of the host cell you have to have an

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460
of the host cell you have to have an
 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.410
of the host cell you have to have an
enzyme that convert it can convert it

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:44.420
enzyme that convert it can convert it
 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.990
enzyme that convert it can convert it
from RNA to DNA would cells have such an

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000
from RNA to DNA would cells have such an
 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.440
from RNA to DNA would cells have such an
enzyme do you think could they copy that

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450
enzyme do you think could they copy that
 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.920
enzyme do you think could they copy that
viral RNA into DNA now based on what

I've told you you should say no but you

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150
I've told you you should say no but you
 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.960
I've told you you should say no but you
will see that in fact there are reverse

about experiments where he infected

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960
about experiments where he infected
 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.140
about experiments where he infected
cells and he made extracts at different

those out now the idea that an RNA virus

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:19.620
those out now the idea that an RNA virus
 

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.400
those out now the idea that an RNA virus
would make a DNA copy of its genome and

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:22.410
would make a DNA copy of its genome and
 

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:24.950
would make a DNA copy of its genome and
then put that into the cell didn't come

genome was known to be able to integrate
 

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:44.360
genome was known to be able to integrate
its DNA into the bacterial chromosome so

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:44.370
its DNA into the bacterial chromosome so
 

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:48.500
its DNA into the bacterial chromosome so
this original idea that this phage could

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:48.510
this original idea that this phage could
 

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:51.860
this original idea that this phage could
do this came from genetic studies where

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:51.870
do this came from genetic studies where
 

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:55.640
do this came from genetic studies where
genes were mapped on the virus itself

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:55.650
genes were mapped on the virus itself
 

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:59.570
genes were mapped on the virus itself
the phage lambda and the viral genes as

00:07:59.570 --> 00:07:59.580
the phage lambda and the viral genes as
 

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:01.850
the phage lambda and the viral genes as
these were integrated into chromosomal

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:01.860
these were integrated into chromosomal
 

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.100
these were integrated into chromosomal
DNA of the bacteria and the order was

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:04.110
DNA of the bacteria and the order was
 

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:06.890
DNA of the bacteria and the order was
different so here on the top is the DNA

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:06.900
different so here on the top is the DNA
 

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.659
different so here on the top is the DNA
of the phage as its integrated into the

00:08:08.659 --> 00:08:08.669
of the phage as its integrated into the
 

00:08:08.669 --> 00:08:10.430
of the phage as its integrated into the
bacteria they didn't actually know was

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:10.440
bacteria they didn't actually know was
 

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.230
bacteria they didn't actually know was
integrated all they knew is that these

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:12.240
integrated all they knew is that these
 

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.830
integrated all they knew is that these
bacteria had a stable property of a

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:15.840
bacteria had a stable property of a
 

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.960
bacteria had a stable property of a
phage in their genome and you could get

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:17.970
phage in their genome and you could get
 

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:20.900
phage in their genome and you could get
it to come out now and then so the maps

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:20.910
it to come out now and then so the maps
 

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:24.320
it to come out now and then so the maps
of the viral genes were NR a and J but

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:24.330
of the viral genes were NR a and J but
 

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:26.390
of the viral genes were NR a and J but
when you took the phage itself and map

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400
when you took the phage itself and map
 

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.280
when you took the phage itself and map
the genes in the phage you came out with

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:28.290
the genes in the phage you came out with
 

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:30.890
the genes in the phage you came out with
a different order and people didn't

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:30.900
a different order and people didn't
 

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.270
a different order and people didn't
really understand what this meant until

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:32.280
really understand what this meant until
 

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:35.329
really understand what this meant until
alan campbell in 1962 said aha if you

00:08:35.329 --> 00:08:35.339
alan campbell in 1962 said aha if you
 

00:08:35.339 --> 00:08:38.270
alan campbell in 1962 said aha if you
circularize the phage DNA and then

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:38.280
circularize the phage DNA and then
 

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.010
circularize the phage DNA and then
integrate it into the bacterial

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:40.020
integrate it into the bacterial
 

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.230
integrate it into the bacterial
chromosome then you'll change the gene

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:42.240
chromosome then you'll change the gene
 

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.480
chromosome then you'll change the gene
order and you get this order which we

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:44.490
order and you get this order which we
 

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:46.970
order and you get this order which we
see from genetic studies so he said this

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:46.980
see from genetic studies so he said this
 

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:48.740
see from genetic studies so he said this
is what happens the phage DNA becomes

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:48.750
is what happens the phage DNA becomes
 

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.960
is what happens the phage DNA becomes
circular and it goes into the bacterial

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:50.970
circular and it goes into the bacterial
 

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:53.329
circular and it goes into the bacterial
genome and and there's a specific site

00:08:53.329 --> 00:08:53.339
genome and and there's a specific site
 

00:08:53.339 --> 00:08:54.480
genome and and there's a specific site
on the phage where that

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:54.490
on the phage where that
 

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:57.300
on the phage where that
pens all the time and so eventually this

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:57.310
pens all the time and so eventually this
 

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:59.160
pens all the time and so eventually this
was proven to be true so this was in

00:08:59.160 --> 00:08:59.170
was proven to be true so this was in
 

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:02.460

this and saying that these tumor viruses

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:06.700
this and saying that these tumor viruses
 

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:10.920
this and saying that these tumor viruses
do the same thing so this is what a RNA

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:10.930
do the same thing so this is what a RNA
 

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:12.870
do the same thing so this is what a RNA
tumor virus looks like on the left is an

electron micrograph and they are
 

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:16.889
electron micrograph and they are
envelope viruses you can see the

00:09:16.889 --> 00:09:16.899
envelope viruses you can see the
 

00:09:16.899 --> 00:09:19.470
envelope viruses you can see the

courses is full of spikes although you
 

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.150
courses is full of spikes although you
can't see them very well and in the

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:24.160
can't see them very well and in the
 

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.000

immediately that was called the core

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:28.000
immediately that was called the core
 

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.210
immediately that was called the core
although more more accurately we would

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:30.220
although more more accurately we would
 

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:34.590
although more more accurately we would
call it a capsid or a new clio capsid

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:34.600
call it a capsid or a new clio capsid
 

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.680
call it a capsid or a new clio capsid
because it's inside an envelope right so

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:37.690
because it's inside an envelope right so
 

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:39.360
because it's inside an envelope right so

that of course is the core or the capsid
 

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.889
that of course is the core or the capsid
or the nucleocapsid and that is actually

shown in green here and there these are
 

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:00.240
shown in green here and there these are
plus stranded RNAs but there are two

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:00.250
plus stranded RNAs but there are two
 

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:03.480
plus stranded RNAs but there are two
molecules per virion not just one as we

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:03.490
molecules per virion not just one as we
 

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:05.760
molecules per virion not just one as we
see with most other RNA viruses there

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:05.770
see with most other RNA viruses there
 

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:09.120
see with most other RNA viruses there
are two now also there's something very

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:09.130
are two now also there's something very
 

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:12.000
are two now also there's something very
unusual here up to this point in this

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:12.010
unusual here up to this point in this
 

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:13.680
unusual here up to this point in this
course if I told you this was a plus

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:13.690
course if I told you this was a plus
 

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:16.110
course if I told you this was a plus
strand RNA virus and I said does

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:16.120
strand RNA virus and I said does
 

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.660
strand RNA virus and I said does
anything have to come into the cell with

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:18.670
anything have to come into the cell with
 

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:20.370
anything have to come into the cell with
that plus strand you would say no it's a

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:20.380
that plus strand you would say no it's a
 

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:22.680
that plus strand you would say no it's a
plus strand it can be translated and you

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:22.690
plus strand it can be translated and you
 

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:25.139
plus strand it can be translated and you
would be right up until this point but

00:10:25.139 --> 00:10:25.149
would be right up until this point but
 

00:10:25.149 --> 00:10:27.240
would be right up until this point but
from this day onwards this is the

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:27.250
from this day onwards this is the
 

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.519
from this day onwards this is the
exception to that rule the retroviruses

00:10:29.519 --> 00:10:29.529
exception to that rule the retroviruses
 

00:10:29.529 --> 00:10:32.040
exception to that rule the retroviruses
they do bring in some viral proteins

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:32.050
they do bring in some viral proteins
 

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:33.449
they do bring in some viral proteins
with them even though they are plus

00:10:33.449 --> 00:10:33.459
with them even though they are plus
 

00:10:33.459 --> 00:10:36.420
with them even though they are plus
stranded because that plus strand is not

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:36.430
stranded because that plus strand is not
 

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:39.090
stranded because that plus strand is not
translated when it gets into the cell as

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:39.100
translated when it gets into the cell as
 

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.250
translated when it gets into the cell as
you will see so among the proteins that

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:41.260
you will see so among the proteins that
 

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:42.180
you will see so among the proteins that
are brought in or the reverse

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:42.190
are brought in or the reverse
 

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:45.630
are brought in or the reverse
transcriptase RT there's another protein

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:45.640
transcriptase RT there's another protein
 

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.819
transcriptase RT there's another protein
called the integrase I n which we will

00:10:47.819 --> 00:10:47.829
called the integrase I n which we will
 

00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:52.710
called the integrase I n which we will
talk about and then the a protease PR

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:52.720
talk about and then the a protease PR
 

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.960
talk about and then the a protease PR
which is involved in chopping up the

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:54.970
which is involved in chopping up the
 

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:59.310
which is involved in chopping up the
poly protein and this is a map of this

00:10:59.310 --> 00:10:59.320
poly protein and this is a map of this
 

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:02.220
poly protein and this is a map of this
genome because again it's one of these

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:02.230
genome because again it's one of these
 

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:04.260
genome because again it's one of these
problems so if you have a plus strand

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:04.270
problems so if you have a plus strand
 

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:06.750
problems so if you have a plus strand
RNA how do you get a bunch of viral

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:06.760
RNA how do you get a bunch of viral
 

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:07.800

encoding the core or the capsid proteins

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:20.050
encoding the core or the capsid proteins
 

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:22.830
encoding the core or the capsid proteins
it's called the gag protein then in the

it's called the gag protein then in the
 

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.630
it's called the gag protein then in the

00:19:30.369 --> 00:19:34.049
many molecules of RNA and RT in a very
on there you go now the two strands of

00:19:34.049 --> 00:19:34.059
on there you go now the two strands of
 

00:19:34.059 --> 00:19:36.859
on there you go now the two strands of
RNA in the very and why are there two

00:19:36.859 --> 00:19:36.869
RNA in the very and why are there two
 

00:19:36.869 --> 00:19:40.919
RNA in the very and why are there two
what we think is because these viruses

00:19:40.919 --> 00:19:40.929
what we think is because these viruses
 

00:19:40.929 --> 00:19:42.419
what we think is because these viruses
make a lot of mistakes in their

00:19:42.419 --> 00:19:42.429
make a lot of mistakes in their
 

00:19:42.429 --> 00:19:43.979
make a lot of mistakes in their
replication so if you have two copies

00:19:43.979 --> 00:19:43.989
replication so if you have two copies
 

00:19:43.989 --> 00:19:45.090
replication so if you have two copies
you have a better chance of

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:45.100
you have a better chance of
 

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:48.690
you have a better chance of
reconstructing a fully infectious virus

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:48.700
reconstructing a fully infectious virus
 

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:52.229
reconstructing a fully infectious virus
than if you have just one so they have

00:19:52.229 --> 00:19:52.239
than if you have just one so they have
 

00:19:52.239 --> 00:19:55.080
than if you have just one so they have
two copies of every gene not just one so

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:55.090
two copies of every gene not just one so
 

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:57.060
two copies of every gene not just one so
they're highly resistant to mutation or

00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:57.070
they're highly resistant to mutation or
 

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:59.609
they're highly resistant to mutation or
to UV or ionizing radiation which of

00:19:59.609 --> 00:19:59.619
to UV or ionizing radiation which of
 

00:19:59.619 --> 00:20:00.570
to UV or ionizing radiation which of
course is a

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:00.580
course is a
 

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:03.750
course is a
problem for many viruses so if one

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:03.760
problem for many viruses so if one
 

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:08.009
problem for many viruses so if one
strand has a uv-induced mutation it can

00:20:08.009 --> 00:20:08.019
strand has a uv-induced mutation it can
 

00:20:08.019 --> 00:20:10.080
strand has a uv-induced mutation it can
be soup that part of this day RNA can be

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:10.090
be soup that part of this day RNA can be
 

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:11.700
be soup that part of this day RNA can be
supplied by the other part of the strand

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:11.710
supplied by the other part of the strand
 

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:13.139
supplied by the other part of the strand
so this implies that during reverse

00:20:13.139 --> 00:20:13.149
so this implies that during reverse
 

00:20:13.149 --> 00:20:14.700
so this implies that during reverse
transcription there's a lot of jumping

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:14.710
transcription there's a lot of jumping
 

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:16.710
transcription there's a lot of jumping
back and forth and that eventually you

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:16.720
back and forth and that eventually you
 

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:19.259
back and forth and that eventually you
get a molecule that will work okay so

00:20:19.259 --> 00:20:19.269
get a molecule that will work okay so
 

00:20:19.269 --> 00:20:21.630
get a molecule that will work okay so
this is the idea is that that makes them

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:21.640
this is the idea is that that makes them
 

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:25.440
this is the idea is that that makes them
more resistant to mutation let's take a

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:25.450
more resistant to mutation let's take a
 

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:28.860
more resistant to mutation let's take a

chops up the RNA template so what we're

00:23:29.039 --> 00:23:29.049
chops up the RNA template so what we're
 

00:23:29.049 --> 00:23:31.020
chops up the RNA template so what we're
left with is a little bit of overhanging

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:31.030

okay and now it's going to start priming

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:43.720
okay and now it's going to start priming
 

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.240
okay and now it's going to start priming
on the other strand because it turns out

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:45.250
on the other strand because it turns out
 

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:47.730
on the other strand because it turns out
that this is complementary to some

made a full length minus strand that's
 

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:17.650
made a full length minus strand that's
ending right here for now this is the

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:17.660
ending right here for now this is the
 

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:20.170
ending right here for now this is the
original primer binding site remember

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:20.180
original primer binding site remember
 

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:22.540
original primer binding site remember
where the tRNA started so it was copied

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:22.550
where the tRNA started so it was copied
 

00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:24.760
where the tRNA started so it was copied
once and now it's being copied as it was

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:24.770
once and now it's being copied as it was
 

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:26.950
once and now it's being copied as it was
primed it was used as a primer site it's

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:26.960
primed it was used as a primer site it's
 

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:30.790
primed it was used as a primer site it's
been copied now here this plus strand

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:30.800
been copied now here this plus strand
 

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.940
been copied now here this plus strand
DNA continues it goes beyond the tRNA

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:33.950
DNA continues it goes beyond the tRNA
 

00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:36.430
DNA continues it goes beyond the tRNA
because it is in fact complementary to

00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:36.440
because it is in fact complementary to
 

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:38.680
because it is in fact complementary to
this part of the negative strand DNA

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:38.690
this part of the negative strand DNA
 

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:40.990
this part of the negative strand DNA
that's been that's been made and you can

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:41.000
that's been that's been made and you can
 

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000
that's been that's been made and you can
see this is now base pairing and the

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:43.010
see this is now base pairing and the
 

00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:44.520
see this is now base pairing and the
enzyme is going to continue making

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:44.530
enzyme is going to continue making
 

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:47.440
enzyme is going to continue making
another full length plus strand so we'll

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:47.450
another full length plus strand so we'll
 

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:49.360
another full length plus strand so we'll
end up with a minus and a plus strand in

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:49.370
end up with a minus and a plus strand in
 

00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:51.040
end up with a minus and a plus strand in
other words a double-stranded DNA copy

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:51.050
other words a double-stranded DNA copy
 

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:55.210
other words a double-stranded DNA copy
of the viral RNA so this primer binding

00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:55.220
of the viral RNA so this primer binding
 

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:57.550
of the viral RNA so this primer binding
site is being copied here and then it's

00:25:57.550 --> 00:25:57.560
site is being copied here and then it's
 

00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:00.550
site is being copied here and then it's
going to be copied again when the plus

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:00.560
going to be copied again when the plus
 

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:03.970
going to be copied again when the plus
strand is made the result is that we end

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:03.980
strand is made the result is that we end
 

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:06.220
strand is made the result is that we end
up having a duplication at both ends of

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:06.230
up having a duplication at both ends of
 

00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:07.270
up having a duplication at both ends of
the genomes you remember in the

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:07.280
the genomes you remember in the
 

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:09.160
the genomes you remember in the
beginning I said look there's an LTR at

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:09.170
beginning I said look there's an LTR at
 

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:11.920
beginning I said look there's an LTR at
either end that's how this arises by

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:11.930
either end that's how this arises by
 

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:14.650
either end that's how this arises by
this repetitive copying of the ends you

00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:14.660
this repetitive copying of the ends you
 

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:17.080
this repetitive copying of the ends you
need that because the RNA is not the

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:17.090
need that because the RNA is not the
 

00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:18.700
need that because the RNA is not the
full-length copy of the genome so you

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:18.710
full-length copy of the genome so you
 

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:20.320
full-length copy of the genome so you
have to have this funny mechanism for

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:20.330
have to have this funny mechanism for
 

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:23.050
have to have this funny mechanism for
regenerating those ltrs and the LTR on

00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:23.060
regenerating those ltrs and the LTR on
 

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:25.540
regenerating those ltrs and the LTR on
the left has a important promoter in it

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:25.550
the left has a important promoter in it
 

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:27.310
the left has a important promoter in it
so we need to have that in the LTR on

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:27.320
so we need to have that in the LTR on
 

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.650
so we need to have that in the LTR on
the right has a terminator and when

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:29.660
the right has a terminator and when
 

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:31.030
the right has a terminator and when
that's sitting in the genome as a

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:31.040
that's sitting in the genome as a
 

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:33.460
that's sitting in the genome as a
provirus you need to have both ltrs so

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:33.470
provirus you need to have both ltrs so
 

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:35.620
provirus you need to have both ltrs so
this funny business of going around and

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:35.630
this funny business of going around and
 

00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:38.250
this funny business of going around and
copying this region twice gives you that

00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:38.260
copying this region twice gives you that
 

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:40.660
copying this region twice gives you that
utr twice that long terminal repeat

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:40.670
utr twice that long terminal repeat
 

00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:41.320
utr twice that long terminal repeat
twice

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:41.330
twice
 

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:44.500
twice
and finally we can finish up this plus

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:44.510
and finally we can finish up this plus
 

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:46.300
and finally we can finish up this plus

of this slide you don't have to worry

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:47.870
of this slide you don't have to worry
 

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:50.110
of this slide you don't have to worry
about the right at all so this is where

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:50.120
about the right at all so this is where
 

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:52.000
about the right at all so this is where
we left off on the left side we have

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:52.010
we left off on the left side we have
 

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:55.630
we left off on the left side we have
almost a full length minus strand the

00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:55.640
almost a full length minus strand the
 

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.300
almost a full length minus strand the

00:26:58.300 --> 00:26:58.310
light blue and now we're making a plus
 

00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:00.370

00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:00.380
strand remember we've jumped across the
 

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:02.530

00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:02.540
gap we're going to fill this in here and
 

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:05.650
gap we're going to fill this in here and
make a full length double strand and as

00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:05.660
make a full length double strand and as
 

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:07.570
make a full length double strand and as
this happens you know originally this

00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:07.580
this happens you know originally this
 

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:10.720
this happens you know originally this
minus strand had stopped right here at

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:10.730
minus strand had stopped right here at
 

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:13.570

the primer binding site eventually it
actually is extended more to cover this

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:17.450
actually is extended more to cover this
 

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:20.680
actually is extended more to cover this
region and that duplicates the LTR

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:20.690
region and that duplicates the LTR
 

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:22.150
region and that duplicates the LTR
because the LTR is made up of these

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:22.160
because the LTR is made up of these
 

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:25.750
because the LTR is made up of these
sequences you five are you three and ppt

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:25.760
sequences you five are you three and ppt
 

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:28.750
sequences you five are you three and ppt
sorry just you five are and you three so

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:28.760
sorry just you five are and you three so
 

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.400
sorry just you five are and you three so
you can see it's duplicated here so that

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:30.410
you can see it's duplicated here so that
 

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:33.010
you can see it's duplicated here so that
the final double-stranded DNA let's get

00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:33.020
the final double-stranded DNA let's get
 

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:34.540
the final double-stranded DNA let's get
the whole viral genome and it's got an

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:34.550
the whole viral genome and it's got an
 

00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:36.690
the whole viral genome and it's got an
LTR on the left and an LTR on the right

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:36.700
LTR on the left and an LTR on the right
 

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:40.450
LTR on the left and an LTR on the right
and here's the primer binding site which

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:40.460
and here's the primer binding site which
 

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:42.160
and here's the primer binding site which
is where the tRNA would be if this were

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:42.170
is where the tRNA would be if this were
 

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:44.620
is where the tRNA would be if this were
an RNA and here's ppt which is where

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:44.630
an RNA and here's ppt which is where
 

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:47.320
an RNA and here's ppt which is where
that the second strand of DNA synthesis

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:47.330
that the second strand of DNA synthesis
 

00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:50.440
that the second strand of DNA synthesis
initiates so this very baroque method

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:50.450
initiates so this very baroque method
 

00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:52.210
initiates so this very baroque method
gives you a double-stranded DNA copy of

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:52.220
gives you a double-stranded DNA copy of
 

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:53.980
gives you a double-stranded DNA copy of
the genome it duplicates the ends which

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:53.990
the genome it duplicates the ends which
 

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:55.510
the genome it duplicates the ends which
is important because you could need to

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:55.520
is important because you could need to
 

00:27:55.520 --> 00:28:03.770
is important because you could need to
have the LTR at both ends okay

00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:03.780
 

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:16.610
repeat the whole thing which one this

00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:16.620
 

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:20.280
yeah so the enzyme just continues to

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:20.290
yeah so the enzyme just continues to
 

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:22.740
yeah so the enzyme just continues to
copy around here that's what's here and

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:22.750
copy around here that's what's here and
 

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:24.660
copy around here that's what's here and
eventually here it will go all the way

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:24.670
eventually here it will go all the way
 

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:27.210
eventually here it will go all the way
back to ppt which is here so here's ppt

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:27.220
back to ppt which is here so here's ppt
 

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:29.490
back to ppt which is here so here's ppt
it's not it's not been made into a plus

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:29.500
it's not it's not been made into a plus
 

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:31.620
it's not it's not been made into a plus
strand yet but it will be when this

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:31.630
strand yet but it will be when this
 

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:39.720
strand yet but it will be when this
copies all the way around yeah right so

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:39.730
copies all the way around yeah right so
 

00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:43.530
copies all the way around yeah right so
if you just fill this in you would only

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:43.540
if you just fill this in you would only
 

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:46.740
if you just fill this in you would only
have one LTR so what has to happen here

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:46.750
have one LTR so what has to happen here
 

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:48.290
have one LTR so what has to happen here
is you have this strand displacement

00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:48.300
is you have this strand displacement
 

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:51.720
is you have this strand displacement
this displaces the new plus strand and

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:51.730
this displaces the new plus strand and
 

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:53.730
this displaces the new plus strand and
copies in the template underneath it and

00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:53.740
copies in the template underneath it and
 

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:56.640
copies in the template underneath it and
then you duplicate that LTR exactly so

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:56.650
then you duplicate that LTR exactly so
 

00:28:56.650 --> 00:29:01.520
then you duplicate that LTR exactly so
that's how you get the LTR duplicated ok

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:01.530
that's how you get the LTR duplicated ok
 

00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:04.680
that's how you get the LTR duplicated ok
ok so let's talk a little bit about

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:04.690
ok so let's talk a little bit about
 

00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:06.680
ok so let's talk a little bit about
these proteins that do this interesting

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:06.690
these proteins that do this interesting
 

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:10.260
these proteins that do this interesting
copying these this is the mRNA of a

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:10.270
copying these this is the mRNA of a
 

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:14.250
copying these this is the mRNA of a
typical retrovirus the gag proteins are

00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:14.260
typical retrovirus the gag proteins are
 

00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:15.990
typical retrovirus the gag proteins are
encoded on the left 5 prime end we have

00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:16.000
encoded on the left 5 prime end we have
 

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.580
encoded on the left 5 prime end we have
the Paul in the middle and the envelope

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:17.590
the Paul in the middle and the envelope
 

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:19.560
the Paul in the middle and the envelope
is on the right these are different

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:19.570
is on the right these are different
 

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:22.590
is on the right these are different
kinds of retroviruses the ASL vs the

00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:22.600
kinds of retroviruses the ASL vs the
 

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:24.600
kinds of retroviruses the ASL vs the
murine leukemia viruses and here we have

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:24.610
murine leukemia viruses and here we have
 

00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:27.960
murine leukemia viruses and here we have
HIV 1 and this is the Paul region which

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:27.970
HIV 1 and this is the Paul region which
 

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:30.090
HIV 1 and this is the Paul region which
encodes reverse transcriptase integrase

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:30.100
encodes reverse transcriptase integrase
 

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:33.270
encodes reverse transcriptase integrase
and RNA SH and the way these are made

00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:33.280
and RNA SH and the way these are made
 

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:35.100
and RNA SH and the way these are made
are different for the different kinds of

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:35.110
are different for the different kinds of
 

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:38.910
are different for the different kinds of
viruses so for example the ASL vs they

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:38.920
viruses so for example the ASL vs they
 

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:41.100
viruses so for example the ASL vs they
some they sometimes make a full-length

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:41.110
some they sometimes make a full-length
 

00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:45.360
some they sometimes make a full-length
Paul protein so it has polymerase RNA CH

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:45.370
Paul protein so it has polymerase RNA CH
 

00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:47.700
Paul protein so it has polymerase RNA CH
integrase all as one protein and that

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:47.710
integrase all as one protein and that
 

00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:52.290
integrase all as one protein and that
can work as a RT in RNA SH and sometimes

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:52.300
can work as a RT in RNA SH and sometimes
 

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:53.730
can work as a RT in RNA SH and sometimes
they cut off the integrase and that

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:53.740
they cut off the integrase and that
 

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:55.550
they cut off the integrase and that
gives you a few integrase protein and

00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:55.560
gives you a few integrase protein and
 

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.780
gives you a few integrase protein and
that room that leaves you with reverse

00:29:57.780 --> 00:29:57.790
that room that leaves you with reverse
 

00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:00.420
that room that leaves you with reverse
transcriptase and RNA SH and that

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:00.430
transcriptase and RNA SH and that
 

00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:02.070

functions perfectly well to reverse

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:02.080
functions perfectly well to reverse
 

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:06.000
functions perfectly well to reverse
transcribe and chop off the RNA as you

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:06.010
transcribe and chop off the RNA as you
 

00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:07.860
transcribe and chop off the RNA as you
will see because these two things have

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:07.870
will see because these two things have
 

00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:09.660
will see because these two things have
to go hand-in-hand you make a DNA copy

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:09.670
to go hand-in-hand you make a DNA copy
 

00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:12.120
to go hand-in-hand you make a DNA copy
then you chop up the RNA template the

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:12.130
then you chop up the RNA template the
 

00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:16.560
then you chop up the RNA template the
murine leukemia viruses process

integrase and HIV also does the same
 

00:30:26.019 --> 00:30:27.690
integrase and HIV also does the same
thing and it also makes a separate arty

00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:27.700
thing and it also makes a separate arty
 

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:29.700
thing and it also makes a separate arty
integrase needs to be a separate protein

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:29.710
integrase needs to be a separate protein
 

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:31.680
integrase needs to be a separate protein
because it functions at a different part

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:31.690
because it functions at a different part
 

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:33.930
because it functions at a different part
of the lifestyle but the arty will

either side this is a hallmark of

00:35:37.339 --> 00:35:37.349
either side this is a hallmark of
 

00:35:37.349 --> 00:35:41.020
either side this is a hallmark of
reverse transcription and integration

00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:41.030

secondly you lose two bases at either

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:44.400
secondly you lose two bases at either
 

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.810
secondly you lose two bases at either
end of the viral DNA you can see there's

00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:47.820
end of the viral DNA you can see there's
 

00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:51.020
end of the viral DNA you can see there's
a ATG here but there's only TG here so

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:51.030
a ATG here but there's only TG here so
 

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:53.210
a ATG here but there's only TG here so
that the two A's have been lost two A's

00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:53.220
that the two A's have been lost two A's
 

00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:55.400
that the two A's have been lost two A's
are clipped off either end again you'll

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:55.410
are clipped off either end again you'll
 

00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:57.230
are clipped off either end again you'll
see why that happens when we go through

00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:57.240
see why that happens when we go through
 

00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:01.040
see why that happens when we go through
the mechanism and finally this is

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:01.050
the mechanism and finally this is
 

00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:04.790
the mechanism and finally this is
transcribed by cellular DNA dependent

RNA which can be used for proteins or
 

00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:12.500
RNA which can be used for proteins or
can become the viral RNA genome so this

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:12.510
can become the viral RNA genome so this
 

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:14.690
can become the viral RNA genome so this
is very unusual we have a viral genome

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:14.700
is very unusual we have a viral genome
 

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:17.900
is very unusual we have a viral genome
that is the process of being mRNA

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:17.910
that is the process of being mRNA
 

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:21.530
that is the process of being mRNA
transcription by a host cell enzyme and

00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:21.540

the promoter for this mRNA synthesis you

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:25.410
the promoter for this mRNA synthesis you
 

00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:27.520
the promoter for this mRNA synthesis you
remember from last time RNA initiates

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:27.530
remember from last time RNA initiates
 

00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:29.990
remember from last time RNA initiates
mRNAs are initiated at specific promoter

00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000
mRNAs are initiated at specific promoter
 

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.770
mRNAs are initiated at specific promoter
sequences that is located in this LTR so

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:33.780
sequences that is located in this LTR so
 

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:37.670
sequences that is located in this LTR so
you need to have that LTR for mrna to be

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:37.680
you need to have that LTR for mrna to be
 

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:46.329
you need to have that LTR for mrna to be
made yes

00:36:46.329 --> 00:36:46.339
 

00:36:46.339 --> 00:36:53.920
correct it probably is a matter of

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:53.930
correct it probably is a matter of
 

00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:56.329
correct it probably is a matter of
quantities early an infection there is

00:36:56.329 --> 00:36:56.339
quantities early an infection there is
 

00:36:56.339 --> 00:36:58.760

not much protein around to make virions

00:36:58.760 --> 00:36:58.770
not much protein around to make virions
 

00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:01.160
not much protein around to make virions
so that's preferentially translated into

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:01.170
so that's preferentially translated into
 

00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:03.049
so that's preferentially translated into
protein and then when you start

00:37:03.049 --> 00:37:03.059
protein and then when you start
 

00:37:03.059 --> 00:37:05.180
protein and then when you start
accumulating enough viral proteins to

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:05.190
accumulating enough viral proteins to
 

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:07.940
accumulating enough viral proteins to
make capsids then then the pool of RNAs

00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:07.950
make capsids then then the pool of RNAs
 

00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:10.339
make capsids then then the pool of RNAs
get shifted to that right but they're

00:37:10.339 --> 00:37:10.349
get shifted to that right but they're
 

00:37:10.349 --> 00:37:13.930
get shifted to that right but they're
they're indistinguishable same molecule

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:13.940
they're indistinguishable same molecule
 

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:17.839
they're indistinguishable same molecule
so the mRNA initiates here and it's

00:37:17.839 --> 00:37:17.849
so the mRNA initiates here and it's
 

00:37:17.849 --> 00:37:20.150
so the mRNA initiates here and it's
terminated there's a specific terminator

00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:20.160
terminated there's a specific terminator
 

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:22.430
terminated there's a specific terminator
remember same with mrna transcription of

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:22.440
remember same with mrna transcription of
 

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:25.039
remember same with mrna transcription of
host cell genes it's a terminator in the

00:37:25.039 --> 00:37:25.049
host cell genes it's a terminator in the
 

00:37:25.049 --> 00:37:27.160
host cell genes it's a terminator in the
right LTR so that's why we need both

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:27.170
right LTR so that's why we need both
 

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:31.460
right LTR so that's why we need both
ltrs but this RNA doesn't have both ltrs

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:31.470
ltrs but this RNA doesn't have both ltrs
 

00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:33.770
ltrs but this RNA doesn't have both ltrs
because it initiates within the LTR and

00:37:33.770 --> 00:37:33.780
because it initiates within the LTR and
 

00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:35.750
because it initiates within the LTR and
terminates within the LTR that's again

00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:35.760
terminates within the LTR that's again
 

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:38.480
terminates within the LTR that's again
why we have to do that baroque copying

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:38.490
why we have to do that baroque copying
 

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:40.309
why we have to do that baroque copying
to duplicate the LTR at either end

00:37:40.309 --> 00:37:40.319
to duplicate the LTR at either end
 

00:37:40.319 --> 00:37:42.410
to duplicate the LTR at either end
otherwise we lose sequence and that

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:42.420
otherwise we lose sequence and that
 

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:45.079
otherwise we lose sequence and that
wouldn't that wouldn't work all right

00:37:45.079 --> 00:37:45.089
wouldn't that wouldn't work all right
 

00:37:45.089 --> 00:37:46.819
wouldn't that wouldn't work all right
let's take a look at this integration in

00:37:46.819 --> 00:37:46.829
let's take a look at this integration in
 

00:37:46.829 --> 00:37:48.470
let's take a look at this integration in
a little detail so you understand this

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480
a little detail so you understand this
 

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:52.640
a little detail so you understand this
duplication and loss of sequence so here

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:52.650
duplication and loss of sequence so here
 

00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:55.549
duplication and loss of sequence so here
at the upper left is our double-stranded

00:37:55.549 --> 00:37:55.559
at the upper left is our double-stranded
 

00:37:55.559 --> 00:37:58.309
at the upper left is our double-stranded
retro viral DNA and this is integrase

00:37:58.309 --> 00:37:58.319
retro viral DNA and this is integrase
 

00:37:58.319 --> 00:38:02.720
retro viral DNA and this is integrase
this yellow protein in the background

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:02.730
this yellow protein in the background
 

00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:06.410
this yellow protein in the background
here the two nucleotides from each end

00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:06.420
here the two nucleotides from each end
 

00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:09.650
here the two nucleotides from each end
are clipped off so today's these two

00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:09.660
are clipped off so today's these two
 

00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:11.630
are clipped off so today's these two
ends at the three prime end here and

00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:11.640
ends at the three prime end here and
 

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:13.640
ends at the three prime end here and
here of the other side they're both

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:13.650
here of the other side they're both
 

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:17.240
here of the other side they're both
clipped off by the integrase so that's

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:17.250
clipped off by the integrase so that's
 

00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:20.210
clipped off by the integrase so that's
the source of losing two bases and then

00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:20.220
the source of losing two bases and then
 

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:23.329
the source of losing two bases and then
the three prime hydroxyl attacks the

00:38:23.329 --> 00:38:23.339
the three prime hydroxyl attacks the
 

00:38:23.339 --> 00:38:27.200
the three prime hydroxyl attacks the
target DNA here and here so this this is

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:27.210
target DNA here and here so this this is
 

00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:29.329
target DNA here and here so this this is
the target the Unites chromosomal DNA of

00:38:29.329 --> 00:38:29.339
the target the Unites chromosomal DNA of
 

00:38:29.339 --> 00:38:31.819
the target the Unites chromosomal DNA of
the host cell it's being attacked by the

00:38:31.819 --> 00:38:31.829
the host cell it's being attacked by the
 

00:38:31.829 --> 00:38:35.210
the host cell it's being attacked by the
three prime hydroxyl of those two newly

00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:35.220
three prime hydroxyl of those two newly
 

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:37.520
three prime hydroxyl of those two newly
generated ends along with the integrase

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:37.530
generated ends along with the integrase
 

00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:40.339
generated ends along with the integrase
of course and it is ligated it is the

00:38:40.339 --> 00:38:40.349
of course and it is ligated it is the
 

00:38:40.349 --> 00:38:43.579
of course and it is ligated it is the
host DNA is nicked and then the nick

00:38:43.579 --> 00:38:43.589
host DNA is nicked and then the nick
 

00:38:43.589 --> 00:38:45.710
host DNA is nicked and then the nick
dens are joined with the viral DNA ends

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:45.720
dens are joined with the viral DNA ends
 

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:47.480
dens are joined with the viral DNA ends
so that's what you see on the third

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:47.490
so that's what you see on the third
 

00:38:47.490 --> 00:38:49.670
so that's what you see on the third
panel here we've now joined the three

00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680
panel here we've now joined the three
 

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:54.250
panel here we've now joined the three
prime ends of the viral DNA

00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:54.260
prime ends of the viral DNA
 

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:58.820
prime ends of the viral DNA
with host cell DNA okay so now this is

00:38:58.820 --> 00:38:58.830
with host cell DNA okay so now this is
 

00:38:58.830 --> 00:39:01.550
with host cell DNA okay so now this is
conceived our DNA is contiguous with the

00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:01.560
conceived our DNA is contiguous with the
 

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:05.780
conceived our DNA is contiguous with the
host cell DNA the integrase then fills

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:05.790
host cell DNA the integrase then fills
 

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:09.650
host cell DNA the integrase then fills
in the gaps so these are gaps right here

00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:09.660
in the gaps so these are gaps right here
 

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:12.020
in the gaps so these are gaps right here
where the host DNA is single-stranded

00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:12.030
where the host DNA is single-stranded
 

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:14.690
where the host DNA is single-stranded
that's filled in and now you see it in

00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:14.700
that's filled in and now you see it in
 

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:17.540
that's filled in and now you see it in
yellow and orange here and now it's

00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:17.550
yellow and orange here and now it's
 

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:20.450
yellow and orange here and now it's
integrated so this explains the loss of

00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:20.460
integrated so this explains the loss of
 

00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:23.660
integrated so this explains the loss of
the two bases at the end and why we have

00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:23.670
the two bases at the end and why we have
 

00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:25.970
the two bases at the end and why we have
a duplicated sequence because each of

00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:25.980
a duplicated sequence because each of
 

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:27.890
a duplicated sequence because each of
these two strands is copied to form a

00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:27.900
these two strands is copied to form a
 

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:29.660
these two strands is copied to form a
duplex so that's why the target sequence

00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:29.670
duplex so that's why the target sequence
 

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:32.720
duplex so that's why the target sequence
is duplicated so we start with a

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:32.730
is duplicated so we start with a
 

00:39:32.730 --> 00:39:35.210
is duplicated so we start with a
double-stranded DNA you Nick you take

00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:35.220
double-stranded DNA you Nick you take
 

00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:37.400
double-stranded DNA you Nick you take
off two bases you Nick the target DNA

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:37.410
off two bases you Nick the target DNA
 

00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:40.490
off two bases you Nick the target DNA
you like the viral DNA to the target you

00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:40.500
you like the viral DNA to the target you
 

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:43.040
you like the viral DNA to the target you
fill in the gap and there you have an

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:43.050
fill in the gap and there you have an
 

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:54.530
fill in the gap and there you have an
integrated DNA a pro virus Yeah Yeah

00:39:54.530 --> 00:39:54.540

a also has two amino acids that bind
 

00:40:20.350 --> 00:40:22.290
a also has two amino acids that bind
metals so they can carry out these

00:40:22.290 --> 00:40:22.300
metals so they can carry out these
 

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:25.440
metals so they can carry out these
various activities it also has a DNA

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:25.450
various activities it also has a DNA
 

00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:29.070
various activities it also has a DNA
binding domain so it's got a zinc

00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:29.080
binding domain so it's got a zinc
 

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:31.440
binding domain so it's got a zinc
binding domain that core catalytic

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:31.450
binding domain that core catalytic
 

00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:33.120

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:37.450
domain and this protein integrase forms
 

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:39.570
domain and this protein integrase forms
dimers as shown on the left and we think

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:39.580
dimers as shown on the left and we think
 

00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:42.780
dimers as shown on the left and we think
the active form of the integrase is

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:42.790
the active form of the integrase is
 

00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:45.060
the active form of the integrase is
actually a tetramer which is shown on

00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:45.070
actually a tetramer which is shown on
 

00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:48.270
actually a tetramer which is shown on
the right so four of those individual

00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:48.280
the right so four of those individual
 

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:50.850
the right so four of those individual
molecules make an active enzyme and

00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:50.860
molecules make an active enzyme and
 

00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:53.910
molecules make an active enzyme and
that's the surface on which this nicking

00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:53.920
that's the surface on which this nicking
 

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:56.550
that's the surface on which this nicking
and ligating and filling in activity

00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:56.560
and ligating and filling in activity
 

00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:58.710
and ligating and filling in activity
occurs right that we just went through

00:40:58.710 --> 00:40:58.720
occurs right that we just went through
 

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:01.650
occurs right that we just went through
so here are one two three four monomers

00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:01.660
so here are one two three four monomers
 

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:04.830
so here are one two three four monomers
of the integrase here's the catalytic

00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:04.840
of the integrase here's the catalytic
 

00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:07.380
of the integrase here's the catalytic
site right here on the surface this is

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:07.390
site right here on the surface this is
 

00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:09.150
site right here on the surface this is
target DNA it's going to be nicked right

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:09.160
target DNA it's going to be nicked right
 

00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:11.340
target DNA it's going to be nicked right
here and then the viral DNA will be

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:11.350
here and then the viral DNA will be
 

00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:12.750
here and then the viral DNA will be
ligated to it so all those activities

00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:12.760
ligated to it so all those activities
 

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:14.700
ligated to it so all those activities
occur on this catalytic surface of a

00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:14.710
occur on this catalytic surface of a
 

00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:23.680
occur on this catalytic surface of a
tetramer yeah

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:23.690
 

00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:25.750
this is a good question I'm going to

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:25.760
this is a good question I'm going to
 

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:28.390
this is a good question I'm going to
talk about it a little right now it's

00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:28.400
talk about it a little right now it's
 

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:29.800
talk about it a little right now it's
probably the integrase plus some other

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:29.810
probably the integrase plus some other
 

00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:34.210
probably the integrase plus some other
cell proteins are involved in that so

00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:34.220
cell proteins are involved in that so
 

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:35.920
cell proteins are involved in that so
the process we've been talking about

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:35.930
the process we've been talking about
 

00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:38.140
the process we've been talking about
infection reverse transcription occurs

00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:38.150
infection reverse transcription occurs
 

00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:42.010
infection reverse transcription occurs
in the cytoplasm and this occurs in a

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:42.020
in the cytoplasm and this occurs in a
 

00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:44.440
in the cytoplasm and this occurs in a
sub viral particle you see there's still

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:44.450
sub viral particle you see there's still
 

00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:46.859
sub viral particle you see there's still
some viral proteins around it and

00:41:46.859 --> 00:41:46.869
some viral proteins around it and
 

00:41:46.869 --> 00:41:48.910
some viral proteins around it and
eventually when this is made

00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:48.920
eventually when this is made
 

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:51.220
eventually when this is made
double-stranded DNA will be brought into

00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:51.230
double-stranded DNA will be brought into
 

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:53.589
double-stranded DNA will be brought into
the nucleus by nuclear import so this is

00:41:53.589 --> 00:41:53.599
the nucleus by nuclear import so this is
 

00:41:53.599 --> 00:41:55.930
the nucleus by nuclear import so this is
small enough to go through a nuclear

00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:55.940
small enough to go through a nuclear
 

00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:59.740
small enough to go through a nuclear
pore and then this will integrate in

00:41:59.740 --> 00:41:59.750
pore and then this will integrate in
 

00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:03.670
pore and then this will integrate in
cellular DNA now there are some proteins

00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:03.680
cellular DNA now there are some proteins
 

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:08.230
cellular DNA now there are some proteins

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:10.300
shown on this slide bath lap 2 HMG mrn
these are all proteins thought these are

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:10.310
these are all proteins thought these are
 

00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:11.589
these are all proteins thought these are
cell proteins that are thought to be

00:42:11.589 --> 00:42:11.599
cell proteins that are thought to be
 

00:42:11.599 --> 00:42:15.970
cell proteins that are thought to be
involved in the integration steps and in

00:42:15.970 --> 00:42:15.980
involved in the integration steps and in
 

00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:18.420
involved in the integration steps and in
particular there there appear to be

00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:18.430
particular there there appear to be
 

00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:21.849
particular there there appear to be
interactions between baths and amarin

00:42:21.849 --> 00:42:21.859
interactions between baths and amarin
 

00:42:21.859 --> 00:42:24.550
interactions between baths and amarin
which helps which is believed to

00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:24.560
which helps which is believed to
 

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:27.400
which helps which is believed to
localize this what's called a pre

integration complex to chromatin and
 

00:42:29.839 --> 00:42:33.300

protein called ledge f which is
 

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:42.819
protein called ledge f which is
associated with nucleosomes that's

00:42:42.819 --> 00:42:42.829
associated with nucleosomes that's
 

00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:45.099
associated with nucleosomes that's
thought to bring the pre-integration

00:42:45.099 --> 00:42:45.109
thought to bring the pre-integration

chromosomal DNA this is a pretty active

00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:50.720
chromosomal DNA this is a pretty active
 

00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:52.839
chromosomal DNA this is a pretty active
area of investigation to sort this out

00:42:52.839 --> 00:42:52.849
area of investigation to sort this out
 

00:42:52.849 --> 00:42:55.300
area of investigation to sort this out
but there clearly are cell proteins that

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:55.310
but there clearly are cell proteins that
 

00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:56.890
but there clearly are cell proteins that
are needed for this step to bring this

00:42:56.890 --> 00:42:56.900
are needed for this step to bring this
 

00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:59.109
are needed for this step to bring this

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:06.560
integration of retro viral DNA is seems
 

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:07.690
integration of retro viral DNA is seems
to be random there's no specific

00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:07.700
to be random there's no specific
 

00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:10.750
to be random there's no specific
sequence so in bacteria where lambda

00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:10.760
sequence so in bacteria where lambda
 

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:13.180
sequence so in bacteria where lambda
integrates is an ad sequence very

00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:13.190

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:14.680
integrates is an ad sequence very
specific place where the phage

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:14.690

integrates it's not the case for retro

00:43:16.569 --> 00:43:16.579
integrates it's not the case for retro
 

00:43:16.579 --> 00:43:19.120
integrates it's not the case for retro
viral DNA integration seems to be random

00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:19.130
viral DNA integration seems to be random
 

00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:22.180
viral DNA integration seems to be random
but it seems to occur where there are

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:22.190
but it seems to occur where there are
 

00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:25.960
but it seems to occur where there are
exposed areas in chromatin so it's

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:25.970
exposed areas in chromatin so it's
 

00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:27.760
exposed areas in chromatin so it's
typically associated with bent or

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:27.770
typically associated with bent or
 

00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:29.410
typically associated with bent or
exposed areas of the chromatin which

00:43:29.410 --> 00:43:29.420
exposed areas of the chromatin which
 

00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:33.160

makes sense I believe yes here is a

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:33.170
makes sense I believe yes here is a
 

00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:35.390
makes sense I believe yes here is a

integration this is done by sequencing

00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:41.460
integration this is done by sequencing
 

00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:43.700
integration this is done by sequencing
the proviral DNA in a variety of

00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:43.710
the proviral DNA in a variety of
 

00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:46.730
the proviral DNA in a variety of
different kinds of cells so you just

00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:46.740
different kinds of cells so you just
 

00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:48.410
different kinds of cells so you just
make cellular DNA is done from either

00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:48.420
make cellular DNA is done from either
 

00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:51.230
make cellular DNA is done from either
human cells or mouse cells and you just

00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:51.240
human cells or mouse cells and you just
 

00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:53.240
human cells or mouse cells and you just
sequence across the ends and you see

00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:53.250
sequence across the ends and you see
 

00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:55.760
sequence across the ends and you see
what cellular genes has the virus

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:55.770
what cellular genes has the virus
 

00:43:55.770 --> 00:43:59.029
what cellular genes has the virus
integrated into and what we're looking

00:43:59.029 --> 00:43:59.039
integrated into and what we're looking
 

00:43:59.039 --> 00:44:00.980
integrated into and what we're looking
at here is percent integration in

00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:00.990
at here is percent integration in
 

00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:03.319
at here is percent integration in
different regions so let's look at human

00:44:03.319 --> 00:44:03.329
different regions so let's look at human
 

00:44:03.329 --> 00:44:05.870
different regions so let's look at human
cells first of all so we're looking at

00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:05.880
cells first of all so we're looking at
 

00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:08.390
cells first of all so we're looking at
first of all these viruses go into every

00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:08.400
first of all these viruses go into every
 

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:10.160
first of all these viruses go into every
chromosome there's no chromosomal

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:10.170
chromosome there's no chromosomal
 

00:44:10.170 --> 00:44:12.410
chromosome there's no chromosomal
preference and within the chromosome

00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:12.420
preference and within the chromosome
 

00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:14.150
preference and within the chromosome
here they have looked at integration

00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160
here they have looked at integration
 

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:16.339
here they have looked at integration
within genes that is within the coding

00:44:16.339 --> 00:44:16.349
within genes that is within the coding
 

00:44:16.349 --> 00:44:19.819
within genes that is within the coding
sequence or within transcription start

00:44:19.819 --> 00:44:19.829
sequence or within transcription start
 

00:44:19.829 --> 00:44:24.170
sequence or within transcription start
sites so if you randomly through a piece

00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:24.180
sites so if you randomly through a piece
 

00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:26.210
sites so if you randomly through a piece
of DNA into the chromosome you would

so retro viral insertion can cause

00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:50.880
so retro viral insertion can cause
 

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:54.350
so retro viral insertion can cause
problems in a variety of ways and we'll

interesting enzymatic ways of excising
the provirus because people with HIV you

00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:23.730
the provirus because people with HIV you
 

00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:25.010
the provirus because people with HIV you
can never get rid of all the infected

00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:25.020
can never get rid of all the infected
 

00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:27.560
can never get rid of all the infected
cells and there's no way to get rid of

00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:27.570
cells and there's no way to get rid of
 

00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:28.790
cells and there's no way to get rid of
the provirus so you have to stay on

00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:28.800
the provirus so you have to stay on
 

00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:30.830
the provirus so you have to stay on
antivirals your entire life so if you

00:46:30.830 --> 00:46:30.840
antivirals your entire life so if you
 

00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:34.040
antivirals your entire life so if you
could excise the proviral DNA you would

00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:34.050
could excise the proviral DNA you would
 

00:46:34.050 --> 00:46:36.470
could excise the proviral DNA you would
be cured completely of infection so

00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:36.480
be cured completely of infection so
 

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:38.270
be cured completely of infection so
people are working on ways to do this

00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:38.280
people are working on ways to do this
 

00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:42.380
people are working on ways to do this
but it's at least a decade off now these

because if when these get integrated

00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:48.150
because if when these get integrated
 

00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:50.990
because if when these get integrated
into animals you can trackback the time

00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:51.000
into animals you can trackback the time
 

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.210
into animals you can trackback the time
that viruses appeared in that kind of

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:53.220
that viruses appeared in that kind of
 

00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:57.170
that viruses appeared in that kind of
animal and you can also time how long

00:46:57.170 --> 00:46:57.180
animal and you can also time how long
 

00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:59.150

these genomes have been in an animal

00:46:59.150 --> 00:46:59.160
these genomes have been in an animal
 

00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:01.430
these genomes have been in an animal
because they mutate every time the cell

00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:01.440
because they mutate every time the cell
 

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:03.440
because they mutate every time the cell
divides and you can count the number of

00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:03.450
divides and you can count the number of
 

00:47:03.450 --> 00:47:04.880
divides and you can count the number of
mutations so you can say this has been

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:04.890
mutations so you can say this has been
 

00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:06.710

is an integrating interesting situation

00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:41.240
is an integrating interesting situation
 

00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:44.000
is an integrating interesting situation
that the virus is now in the genome the

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:44.010
that the virus is now in the genome the
 

00:47:44.010 --> 00:47:45.560
that the virus is now in the genome the
only way the virus can get out is to be

00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:45.570
only way the virus can get out is to be
 

00:47:45.570 --> 00:47:49.130
only way the virus can get out is to be
transcribed by host cell DNA and that's

00:47:49.130 --> 00:47:49.140
transcribed by host cell DNA and that's
 

00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:51.500
transcribed by host cell DNA and that's
done by Paul to so think about this

00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:51.510
done by Paul to so think about this
 

00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:53.870

virus actually does not replicate its
 

00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:56.480
virus actually does not replicate its
genome right it doesn't have an RNA

replicate the genome it goes into your
 

00:48:00.450 --> 00:48:01.550
replicate the genome it goes into your
host cell DNA

00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:01.560
host cell DNA
 

00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:03.850
host cell DNA
replicates as your chromosomal DNA

00:48:03.850 --> 00:48:03.860
replicates as your chromosomal DNA
 

00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:07.610
replicates as your chromosomal DNA
replicates but the mRNAs that are

00:48:07.610 --> 00:48:07.620
replicates but the mRNAs that are
 

00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:09.650

so there's really no enzyme that
 

00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:14.120
so there's really no enzyme that
actually go viral enzyme that replicates

00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:14.130
actually go viral enzyme that replicates

00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:22.530
this there's a promoter built into the
 

00:48:22.530 --> 00:48:24.590
this there's a promoter built into the
left-hand LTR we talked about you need

00:48:24.590 --> 00:48:24.600
left-hand LTR we talked about you need
 

00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:28.130
left-hand LTR we talked about you need
that for making mrna and that's that

00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:28.140
that for making mrna and that's that
 

00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:30.020
that for making mrna and that's that
directs the host transcription machinery

00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:30.030
directs the host transcription machinery
 

00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:32.780
directs the host transcription machinery
and then that mRNA is made the proteins

00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:32.790
and then that mRNA is made the proteins
 

00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:34.670
and then that mRNA is made the proteins
are encapsulated as we have said there's

00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:34.680
are encapsulated as we have said there's
 

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:37.430
are encapsulated as we have said there's
no DNA replication and there's no RNA

00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440
no DNA replication and there's no RNA
 

00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:39.650
no DNA replication and there's no RNA
replication really from this for this

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:39.660
replication really from this for this
 

00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:41.150
replication really from this for this
virus only reverse transcription

00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:41.160
virus only reverse transcription
 

00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:43.400
virus only reverse transcription
integration and transcription that's the

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:43.410
integration and transcription that's the
 

00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:45.290
integration and transcription that's the
strategy really the ultimate parasite I

00:48:45.290 --> 00:48:45.300
strategy really the ultimate parasite I
 

00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:47.600
strategy really the ultimate parasite I
think doesn't even have its own

00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:47.610
think doesn't even have its own
 

00:48:47.610 --> 00:48:53.660
think doesn't even have its own
polymerases so we have made a proviral

00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:53.670
polymerases so we have made a proviral
 

00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:56.690
polymerases so we have made a proviral
DNA the cell is making merrily making

00:48:56.690 --> 00:48:56.700
DNA the cell is making merrily making
 

00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:59.810
DNA the cell is making merrily making
mrnas which give rise to proteins and

00:48:59.810 --> 00:48:59.820
mrnas which give rise to proteins and
 

00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:01.610
mrnas which give rise to proteins and
eventually new viral particles which

00:49:01.610 --> 00:49:01.620
eventually new viral particles which
 

00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:05.600
eventually new viral particles which
encapsulate some of those mrna s so

00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:05.610
encapsulate some of those mrna s so
 

00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:08.060
encapsulate some of those mrna s so
that's retroviruses we will come back to

00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:08.070
that's retroviruses we will come back to
 

00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:12.290
that's retroviruses we will come back to

uses reverse transcriptase for is to

00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:20.220
uses reverse transcriptase for is to
 

00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:24.080
uses reverse transcriptase for is to
copy this viral RNA into DNA doesn't use

00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:24.090
copy this viral RNA into DNA doesn't use
 

00:52:24.090 --> 00:52:25.670
copy this viral RNA into DNA doesn't use
it because it wants to integrate it just

00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:25.680
it because it wants to integrate it just
 

00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:29.430
it because it wants to integrate it just
wants to make a DNA copy so let's take

00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:29.440
wants to make a DNA copy so let's take
 

00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:31.950
wants to make a DNA copy so let's take
look at this reverse transcriptase

00:52:31.950 --> 00:52:31.960
look at this reverse transcriptase
 

00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:33.630
look at this reverse transcriptase
reaction it has some differences from

00:52:33.630 --> 00:52:33.640
reaction it has some differences from
 

00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:35.880
reaction it has some differences from
that which we just talked about which

00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:35.890
that which we just talked about which
 

00:52:35.890 --> 00:52:39.620
that which we just talked about which
are very interesting in contrast to the

00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:39.630
are very interesting in contrast to the
 

00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:45.089
are very interesting in contrast to the
retroviruses the primer for this reverse

00:52:45.089 --> 00:52:45.099
retroviruses the primer for this reverse
 

00:52:45.099 --> 00:52:47.089
retroviruses the primer for this reverse
transcription here's the viral RNA has

00:52:47.089 --> 00:52:47.099
transcription here's the viral RNA has
 

00:52:47.099 --> 00:52:50.670
transcription here's the viral RNA has
two very important structures within it

00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:50.680
two very important structures within it
 

00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:52.710
two very important structures within it
these act as primers there's no tRNA

00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:52.720
these act as primers there's no tRNA
 

00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:55.500
these act as primers there's no tRNA
bound to this RNA but rather the one of

00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:55.510
bound to this RNA but rather the one of
 

00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:57.120
bound to this RNA but rather the one of
these is going to serve as the

00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:57.130
these is going to serve as the
 

00:52:57.130 --> 00:53:00.540
these is going to serve as the
nucleating point for priming the other

00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:00.550
nucleating point for priming the other
 

00:53:00.550 --> 00:53:03.210
nucleating point for priming the other
is going to serve as a nucleating or a

00:53:03.210 --> 00:53:03.220
is going to serve as a nucleating or a
 

00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:05.579
is going to serve as a nucleating or a
primer point for making DNA as we will

00:53:05.579 --> 00:53:05.589
primer point for making DNA as we will
 

00:53:05.589 --> 00:53:08.420
primer point for making DNA as we will
see so on the upper left is the genome

00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:08.430
see so on the upper left is the genome
 

00:53:08.430 --> 00:53:10.829
see so on the upper left is the genome
is the whole genome here's one of those

00:53:10.829 --> 00:53:10.839
is the whole genome here's one of those
 

00:53:10.839 --> 00:53:12.660
is the whole genome here's one of those
structures I just showed you at one end

00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:12.670
structures I just showed you at one end
 

00:53:12.670 --> 00:53:14.160
structures I just showed you at one end
and the other is at the other end and

00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:14.170
and the other is at the other end and
 

00:53:14.170 --> 00:53:17.250
and the other is at the other end and
the ends have repeats just like the

00:53:17.250 --> 00:53:17.260
the ends have repeats just like the
 

00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:19.710
the ends have repeats just like the
retro viral rnas have repeats the direct

00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:19.720
retro viral rnas have repeats the direct
 

00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:22.230
retro viral rnas have repeats the direct
repeat one here is repeated the

00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:22.240
repeat one here is repeated the
 

00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:24.150
repeat one here is repeated the
initiation of reverse transcription

00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.160
initiation of reverse transcription
 

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:26.460
initiation of reverse transcription
takes place at this first hairpin

00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:26.470
takes place at this first hairpin
 

00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:28.890
takes place at this first hairpin
structure which is very near the five

00:53:28.890 --> 00:53:28.900
structure which is very near the five
 

00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:31.319
structure which is very near the five
prime end of the RNA here's the cap very

00:53:31.319 --> 00:53:31.329
prime end of the RNA here's the cap very
 

00:53:31.329 --> 00:53:33.059
prime end of the RNA here's the cap very
much like retro viral reverse

00:53:33.059 --> 00:53:33.069
much like retro viral reverse
 

00:53:33.069 --> 00:53:36.300
much like retro viral reverse
transcription the primer is actually the

00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:36.310
transcription the primer is actually the
 

00:53:36.310 --> 00:53:39.030
transcription the primer is actually the
pea protein which is a combination of a

00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:39.040
pea protein which is a combination of a
 

00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:40.829
pea protein which is a combination of a
primer and reverse transcriptase and

00:53:40.829 --> 00:53:40.839
primer and reverse transcriptase and
 

00:53:40.839 --> 00:53:45.480
primer and reverse transcriptase and
this binds to this stem loop and it and

00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:45.490
this binds to this stem loop and it and
 

00:53:45.490 --> 00:53:48.180
this binds to this stem loop and it and
a reverse transcription is initiated so

00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:48.190
a reverse transcription is initiated so
 

00:53:48.190 --> 00:53:52.170
a reverse transcription is initiated so
now we're making a minus strand DNA copy

00:53:52.170 --> 00:53:52.180
now we're making a minus strand DNA copy
 

00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:53.880
now we're making a minus strand DNA copy
so the genome is plus strand it's an

00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:53.890
so the genome is plus strand it's an
 

00:53:53.890 --> 00:53:57.150
so the genome is plus strand it's an
mRNA made by host cell polymerase so

00:53:57.150 --> 00:53:57.160
mRNA made by host cell polymerase so
 

00:53:57.160 --> 00:53:59.160
mRNA made by host cell polymerase so
here this DNA is being made let's go

00:53:59.160 --> 00:53:59.170
here this DNA is being made let's go
 

00:53:59.170 --> 00:54:03.450
here this DNA is being made let's go
over here it goes a little bit into dr

00:54:03.450 --> 00:54:03.460
over here it goes a little bit into dr
 

00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:05.280
over here it goes a little bit into dr
one and then it jumps to the other end

00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:05.290
one and then it jumps to the other end
 

00:54:05.290 --> 00:54:08.490
one and then it jumps to the other end
of the molecule ok so watch so here the

00:54:08.490 --> 00:54:08.500
of the molecule ok so watch so here the
 

00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:10.650
of the molecule ok so watch so here the
RT is copying this loop it gets a little

00:54:10.650 --> 00:54:10.660
RT is copying this loop it gets a little
 

00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:13.050
RT is copying this loop it gets a little
bit into dr one and this sequence is

00:54:13.050 --> 00:54:13.060
bit into dr one and this sequence is
 

00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:14.670
bit into dr one and this sequence is
repeated at the three prime end of the

00:54:14.670 --> 00:54:14.680
repeated at the three prime end of the
 

00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:18.120
repeated at the three prime end of the
RNA and so the enzyme jumps up there and

00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:18.130
RNA and so the enzyme jumps up there and
 

00:54:18.130 --> 00:54:21.300
RNA and so the enzyme jumps up there and
begins copying there ok so now this we

00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:21.310
begins copying there ok so now this we
 

00:54:21.310 --> 00:54:24.420
begins copying there ok so now this we
move down to step three negative strand

00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:24.430
move down to step three negative strand
 

00:54:24.430 --> 00:54:26.760
move down to step three negative strand
DNA is being made so the enzymes going

00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:26.770
DNA is being made so the enzymes going
 

00:54:26.770 --> 00:54:28.380
DNA is being made so the enzymes going
around the circle the templates being

00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:28.390
around the circle the templates being
 

00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:30.990
around the circle the templates being
degraded as usual and eventually we copy

00:54:30.990 --> 00:54:31.000
degraded as usual and eventually we copy
 

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.540
degraded as usual and eventually we copy
the entire genome we go all the way to

00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:33.550
the entire genome we go all the way to
 

00:54:33.550 --> 00:54:35.400
the entire genome we go all the way to
the cap structure at the five prime end

00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:35.410
the cap structure at the five prime end
 

00:54:35.410 --> 00:54:38.490
the cap structure at the five prime end
of the RNA right here and all the RNA is

00:54:38.490 --> 00:54:38.500
of the RNA right here and all the RNA is
 

00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:40.290
of the RNA right here and all the RNA is
degraded with the exception of a little

00:54:40.290 --> 00:54:40.300
degraded with the exception of a little
 

00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:43.230
degraded with the exception of a little
bit which is the RNA primer

00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:43.240
bit which is the RNA primer
 

00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:45.600
bit which is the RNA primer
which of course is going to serve as a

00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:45.610
which of course is going to serve as a
 

00:54:45.610 --> 00:54:48.210
which of course is going to serve as a
primer for the next strand of DNA so

00:54:48.210 --> 00:54:48.220
primer for the next strand of DNA so
 

00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:50.400
primer for the next strand of DNA so
here's that product we just made a

00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:50.410
here's that product we just made a
 

00:54:50.410 --> 00:54:53.400
here's that product we just made a
full-length negative strand of DNA copy

00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:53.410
full-length negative strand of DNA copy
 

00:54:53.410 --> 00:54:56.040
full-length negative strand of DNA copy
with an RNA primer left here that is

00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:56.050
with an RNA primer left here that is
 

00:54:56.050 --> 00:54:58.470
with an RNA primer left here that is
going to prime synthesis but it doesn't

00:54:58.470 --> 00:54:58.480
going to prime synthesis but it doesn't
 

00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:02.520
going to prime synthesis but it doesn't
go very far before it jumps to this dr

00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:02.530
go very far before it jumps to this dr
 

00:55:02.530 --> 00:55:04.740
go very far before it jumps to this dr
to region so it's the second template

00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:04.750
to region so it's the second template
 

00:55:04.750 --> 00:55:07.560
to region so it's the second template
exchange and then the enzyme begins

00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:07.570
exchange and then the enzyme begins
 

00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:11.220
exchange and then the enzyme begins
copying that eventually reaches the five

00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:11.230
copying that eventually reaches the five
 

00:55:11.230 --> 00:55:13.350
copying that eventually reaches the five
prime protein which is still there

00:55:13.350 --> 00:55:13.360
prime protein which is still there
 

00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:14.910
prime protein which is still there
that's the primer that was used to

00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:14.920
that's the primer that was used to
 

00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:17.060
that's the primer that was used to
initiate the very first round and that

00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:17.070
initiate the very first round and that
 

00:55:17.070 --> 00:55:20.520
initiate the very first round and that
strand simply jumps over to the three

00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:20.530
strand simply jumps over to the three
 

00:55:20.530 --> 00:55:22.050
strand simply jumps over to the three
prime end of the genome right here it

00:55:22.050 --> 00:55:22.060
prime end of the genome right here it
 

00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:23.970
prime end of the genome right here it
can't go any further here so it jumps

00:55:23.970 --> 00:55:23.980
can't go any further here so it jumps
 

00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:26.100
can't go any further here so it jumps
over here and eventually it makes a

00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:26.110
over here and eventually it makes a
 

00:55:26.110 --> 00:55:29.580
over here and eventually it makes a
full-length geno double-stranded genome

00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:29.590
full-length geno double-stranded genome
 

00:55:29.590 --> 00:55:31.320
full-length geno double-stranded genome
but it's not a full-length duplex

00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:31.330
but it's not a full-length duplex
 

00:55:31.330 --> 00:55:33.120
but it's not a full-length duplex
because there's a gap if you remember

00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:33.130
because there's a gap if you remember
 

00:55:33.130 --> 00:55:36.300
because there's a gap if you remember
and there's this protein is left on and

00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:36.310
and there's this protein is left on and
 

00:55:36.310 --> 00:55:39.810
and there's this protein is left on and
this RNA primer is left on so this piece

00:55:39.810 --> 00:55:39.820
this RNA primer is left on so this piece
 

00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:43.010
this RNA primer is left on so this piece
of RNA that we never chewed away is

00:55:43.010 --> 00:55:43.020
of RNA that we never chewed away is
 

00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:45.359
of RNA that we never chewed away is
what's left in the virion it's that

00:55:45.359 --> 00:55:45.369
what's left in the virion it's that
 

00:55:45.369 --> 00:55:47.880
what's left in the virion it's that
little piece of RNA that we find in the

00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:47.890
little piece of RNA that we find in the
 

00:55:47.890 --> 00:55:50.790
little piece of RNA that we find in the
vireo and this is the protein in that's

00:55:50.790 --> 00:55:50.800
vireo and this is the protein in that's
 

00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:52.800
vireo and this is the protein in that's
left on the viral DNA and then it's

00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:52.810
left on the viral DNA and then it's
 

00:55:52.810 --> 00:55:54.690
left on the viral DNA and then it's
never completely made double-stranded

00:55:54.690 --> 00:55:54.700
never completely made double-stranded
 

00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:57.270
never completely made double-stranded
there's a gap and the ends are not

00:55:57.270 --> 00:55:57.280
there's a gap and the ends are not
 

00:55:57.280 --> 00:55:58.890
there's a gap and the ends are not
joined together and that's all a process

00:55:58.890 --> 00:55:58.900
joined together and that's all a process
 

00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:03.090
joined together and that's all a process
of this unusual reverse transcription so

00:56:03.090 --> 00:56:03.100
of this unusual reverse transcription so
 

00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:06.210
of this unusual reverse transcription so
the result is a double-stranded DNA copy

00:56:06.210 --> 00:56:06.220
the result is a double-stranded DNA copy
 

00:56:06.220 --> 00:56:09.180
the result is a double-stranded DNA copy
which could either go into virions or go

00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:09.190
which could either go into virions or go
 

00:56:09.190 --> 00:56:10.980
which could either go into virions or go
back in the nucleus get repaired and

00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:10.990
back in the nucleus get repaired and
 

00:56:10.990 --> 00:56:14.099
back in the nucleus get repaired and
serve to make more mrnas but doesn't

01:00:34.270 --> 01:00:37.590
packaged although the cycles are very
similar as well alright so we have three

01:00:37.590 --> 01:00:37.600
similar as well alright so we have three
 

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:40.290
similar as well alright so we have three
basic ways to use a reverse

01:00:40.290 --> 01:00:40.300
basic ways to use a reverse
 

01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:42.660
basic ways to use a reverse
transcriptase in the life cycle one is

01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:42.670
transcriptase in the life cycle one is
 

01:00:42.670 --> 01:00:44.400
transcriptase in the life cycle one is
in common between cauliflower mosaic

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:44.410
in common between cauliflower mosaic
 

01:00:44.410 --> 01:00:47.340
in common between cauliflower mosaic
virus that have had no viruses the

01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:47.350
virus that have had no viruses the
 

01:00:47.350 --> 01:00:50.940
virus that have had no viruses the
retroviruses package RNA the foamy

01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:50.950
retroviruses package RNA the foamy
 

01:00:50.950 --> 01:00:53.280
retroviruses package RNA the foamy
retroviruses package DNA but they all

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:53.290
retroviruses package DNA but they all
 

01:00:53.290 --> 01:00:55.980
retroviruses package DNA but they all
use this very similar enzyme to copy RNA

01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:55.990
use this very similar enzyme to copy RNA
 

01:00:55.990 --> 01:00:59.640
use this very similar enzyme to copy RNA
into DNA so reverse transcriptase is the

01:00:59.640 --> 01:00:59.650
into DNA so reverse transcriptase is the
 

01:00:59.650 --> 01:01:04.620
into DNA so reverse transcriptase is the
proper name for it okay now let's talk a

01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:04.630
proper name for it okay now let's talk a
 

01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:07.110
proper name for it okay now let's talk a
brief bit about these sequences that are

01:01:07.110 --> 01:01:07.120
brief bit about these sequences that are
 

01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:09.990
brief bit about these sequences that are
in us these endogenous viruses and

01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:10.000
in us these endogenous viruses and
 

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.760
in us these endogenous viruses and
related things they're all called retro

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:11.770
related things they're all called retro
 

01:01:11.770 --> 01:01:15.120
related things they're all called retro
elements so this will refer to not only

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:15.130
elements so this will refer to not only
 

01:01:15.130 --> 01:01:17.460
elements so this will refer to not only
endogenous retroviruses but other

01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:17.470
endogenous retroviruses but other
 

01:01:17.470 --> 01:01:19.440
endogenous retroviruses but other
related sequences that we have in our

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:19.450
related sequences that we have in our
 

01:01:19.450 --> 01:01:21.870
related sequences that we have in our
genomes so a retrovirus related

01:01:21.870 --> 01:01:21.880
genomes so a retrovirus related
 

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:24.000
genomes so a retrovirus related
sequences in cellular genome

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:24.010
sequences in cellular genome
 

01:01:24.010 --> 01:01:27.330
sequences in cellular genome
and as I said before when the DNA is in

01:01:27.330 --> 01:01:27.340
and as I said before when the DNA is in
 

01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:29.460
and as I said before when the DNA is in
your germ line and it can be passed by

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:29.470
your germ line and it can be passed by
 

01:01:29.470 --> 01:01:31.220
your germ line and it can be passed by
heredity it's called an endogenous

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:31.230
heredity it's called an endogenous
 

01:01:31.230 --> 01:01:37.260
heredity it's called an endogenous
provirus most of the time humans in fact

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:37.270
provirus most of the time humans in fact
 

01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:41.490
provirus most of the time humans in fact
all of the retro elements that we have

01:01:41.490 --> 01:01:41.500
all of the retro elements that we have
 

01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:42.900
all of the retro elements that we have
in us and we have a considerable amount

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:42.910
in us and we have a considerable amount
 

01:01:42.910 --> 01:01:45.930
in us and we have a considerable amount
these are all replication defective so

01:01:45.930 --> 01:01:45.940
these are all replication defective so
 

01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:47.490
these are all replication defective so
we don't actually unless you have AIDS

01:01:47.490 --> 01:01:47.500
we don't actually unless you have AIDS
 

01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:50.130
we don't actually unless you have AIDS
you don't make retroviruses right so all

01:01:50.130 --> 01:01:50.140
you don't make retroviruses right so all
 

01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:52.110
you don't make retroviruses right so all
of you have retro elements you have a

01:01:52.110 --> 01:01:52.120
of you have retro elements you have a
 

01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:54.300
of you have retro elements you have a
lot of them but you're not making any

01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:54.310
lot of them but you're not making any
 

01:01:54.310 --> 01:01:57.390
lot of them but you're not making any
virus as far as we know there could be

01:01:57.390 --> 01:01:57.400
virus as far as we know there could be
 

01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:59.130
virus as far as we know there could be
someone walking around the earth right

01:01:59.130 --> 01:01:59.140
someone walking around the earth right
 

01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:01.770
someone walking around the earth right
now making virus but interestingly

01:02:01.770 --> 01:02:01.780
now making virus but interestingly
 

01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:04.050
now making virus but interestingly
different species have a different

01:02:04.050 --> 01:02:04.060
different species have a different
 

01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:07.860
different species have a different
status so mice have also lots of retro

01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:07.870
status so mice have also lots of retro
 

01:02:07.870 --> 01:02:10.220
status so mice have also lots of retro
elements but they make virus particles

01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:10.230
elements but they make virus particles
 

01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:12.570
elements but they make virus particles
doesn't make them sick the wild mice out

01:02:12.570 --> 01:02:12.580
doesn't make them sick the wild mice out
 

01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:14.970
doesn't make them sick the wild mice out
there have lots of retroviruses they're

01:02:14.970 --> 01:02:14.980
there have lots of retroviruses they're
 

01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:17.190
there have lots of retroviruses they're
producing that it doesn't make them sick

01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:17.200
producing that it doesn't make them sick
 

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:19.080
producing that it doesn't make them sick
and it could be that at one time in our

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:19.090
and it could be that at one time in our
 

01:02:19.090 --> 01:02:21.780
and it could be that at one time in our
evolution we also made retroviruses and

01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:21.790
evolution we also made retroviruses and
 

01:02:21.790 --> 01:02:24.120
evolution we also made retroviruses and
maybe we will again someday but all the

01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:24.130
maybe we will again someday but all the
 

01:02:24.130 --> 01:02:26.100
maybe we will again someday but all the
copies we have are heavily mutated so

01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:26.110
copies we have are heavily mutated so
 

01:02:26.110 --> 01:02:29.520
copies we have are heavily mutated so
they don't make particles half of almost

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:29.530
they don't make particles half of almost
 

01:02:29.530 --> 01:02:31.380
they don't make particles half of almost
half of your genome is made up of this

01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:31.390
half of your genome is made up of this
 

01:02:31.390 --> 01:02:34.830

viral I think that's amazing and this

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:38.770
viral I think that's amazing and this
 

01:02:38.770 --> 01:02:40.140
viral I think that's amazing and this
has been with us for a long time

01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:40.150
has been with us for a long time
 

01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:42.750
has been with us for a long time
probably as long as we've been evolving

01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:42.760
probably as long as we've been evolving
 

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:44.520
probably as long as we've been evolving
so the really interesting question which

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:44.530
so the really interesting question which
 

01:02:44.530 --> 01:02:45.930
so the really interesting question which
we don't know the answer to is is it

01:02:45.930 --> 01:02:45.940
we don't know the answer to is is it
 

01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:47.850
we don't know the answer to is is it
good for us there's some there's some

01:02:47.850 --> 01:02:47.860
good for us there's some there's some
 

01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:50.550
good for us there's some there's some
evidence and other animals that some of

01:02:50.550 --> 01:02:50.560
evidence and other animals that some of
 

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:52.170
evidence and other animals that some of
these retro elements are actually

01:02:52.170 --> 01:02:52.180
these retro elements are actually
 

01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:55.520
these retro elements are actually
beneficial and there is one species

01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:55.530
beneficial and there is one species
 

01:02:55.530 --> 01:02:58.050
beneficial and there is one species
where it is believed that placental

01:02:58.050 --> 01:02:58.060
where it is believed that placental
 

01:02:58.060 --> 01:03:00.000
where it is believed that placental
development actually depends on an a

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:00.010
development actually depends on an a
 

01:03:00.010 --> 01:03:02.130
development actually depends on an a
retro element that is actually expressed

01:03:02.130 --> 01:03:02.140
retro element that is actually expressed
 

01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:05.010
retro element that is actually expressed
to form a protein there's no evidence in

01:03:05.010 --> 01:03:05.020
to form a protein there's no evidence in
 

01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:08.880
to form a protein there's no evidence in
people for this so these are diagrams of

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:08.890
people for this so these are diagrams of
 

01:03:08.890 --> 01:03:12.030
people for this so these are diagrams of
some of these retro elements we up at

01:03:12.030 --> 01:03:12.040
some of these retro elements we up at
 

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:14.640
some of these retro elements we up at
the top as an endogenous retrovirus so

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:14.650
the top as an endogenous retrovirus so
 

01:03:14.650 --> 01:03:18.270
the top as an endogenous retrovirus so
this is a proviral DNA that is in your

01:03:18.270 --> 01:03:18.280
this is a proviral DNA that is in your
 

01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:23.190
this is a proviral DNA that is in your
germ line all right and we have between

01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:23.200
germ line all right and we have between
 

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:25.380
germ line all right and we have between
one and a hundred copies of what are

01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:25.390
one and a hundred copies of what are
 

01:03:25.390 --> 01:03:27.870
one and a hundred copies of what are
called human endogenous retrovirus

01:03:27.870 --> 01:03:27.880
called human endogenous retrovirus
 

01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:30.900
called human endogenous retrovirus
curves and again we don't make viruses

01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:30.910
curves and again we don't make viruses
 

01:03:30.910 --> 01:03:33.180
curves and again we don't make viruses
because they're defective but someone

01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:33.190
because they're defective but someone
 

01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:35.760
because they're defective but someone
has cloned out these sequences and fix

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:35.770
has cloned out these sequences and fix
 

01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:36.510
has cloned out these sequences and fix
them

01:03:36.510 --> 01:03:36.520
them
 

01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:38.820
them
you can make a virus from the fixed

01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:38.830
you can make a virus from the fixed
 

01:03:38.830 --> 01:03:41.130
you can make a virus from the fixed
sequence so here's a virus that hasn't

01:03:41.130 --> 01:03:41.140
sequence so here's a virus that hasn't
 

01:03:41.140 --> 01:03:43.110
sequence so here's a virus that hasn't
been circulating for a million hundreds

01:03:43.110 --> 01:03:43.120
been circulating for a million hundreds
 

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:45.090
been circulating for a million hundreds
of thousands of years and you can

01:03:45.090 --> 01:03:45.100
of thousands of years and you can
 

01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:47.220
of thousands of years and you can
actually make it alive again quote

01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:47.230
actually make it alive again quote
 

01:03:47.230 --> 01:03:49.710
actually make it alive again quote
unquote in the laboratory so this looks

01:03:49.710 --> 01:03:49.720
unquote in the laboratory so this looks
 

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:52.410
unquote in the laboratory so this looks
just like a pro virus you have ltrs you

01:03:52.410 --> 01:03:52.420
just like a pro virus you have ltrs you
 

01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:55.560
just like a pro virus you have ltrs you
have ltrs in light color the cellular

01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:55.570
have ltrs in light color the cellular
 

01:03:55.570 --> 01:03:58.980
have ltrs in light color the cellular
sequence is on either side and that dark

01:03:58.980 --> 01:03:58.990
sequence is on either side and that dark
 

01:03:58.990 --> 01:04:01.290
sequence is on either side and that dark
purple is the duplicated cellular target

01:04:01.290 --> 01:04:01.300
purple is the duplicated cellular target
 

01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:03.510
purple is the duplicated cellular target
so you can tell in the genome if you

01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:03.520
so you can tell in the genome if you
 

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:06.540
so you can tell in the genome if you
sequence any mammalian genome you can

01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:06.550
sequence any mammalian genome you can
 

01:04:06.550 --> 01:04:08.010
sequence any mammalian genome you can
tell where there's a retro element

01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:08.020
tell where there's a retro element
 

01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:09.450
tell where there's a retro element
because you have a duplicated host

01:04:09.450 --> 01:04:09.460
because you have a duplicated host
 

01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:12.360
because you have a duplicated host
sequence and ltrs its signature for

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:12.370
sequence and ltrs its signature for
 

01:04:12.370 --> 01:04:15.710
sequence and ltrs its signature for
retro element and then we have

01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:15.720
retro element and then we have
 

01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:18.570
retro element and then we have
retrotransposons which are very similar

01:04:18.570 --> 01:04:18.580
retrotransposons which are very similar
 

01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:21.630
retrotransposons which are very similar
but they have extensive mutations so

01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:21.640
but they have extensive mutations so
 

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:24.090
but they have extensive mutations so
they don't make particles and these are

01:04:24.090 --> 01:04:24.100
they don't make particles and these are
 

01:04:24.100 --> 01:04:25.980
they don't make particles and these are
often in other species as well yeast

01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:25.990
often in other species as well yeast
 

01:04:25.990 --> 01:04:28.140
often in other species as well yeast
have them Drosophila has them as well 10

01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:28.150
have them Drosophila has them as well 10
 

01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:30.780
have them Drosophila has them as well 10
to the 2 to 10 to the 4th copies we have

01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:30.790
to the 2 to 10 to the 4th copies we have
 

01:04:30.790 --> 01:04:34.070
to the 2 to 10 to the 4th copies we have
a lot of line elements long interspersed

01:04:34.070 --> 01:04:34.080
a lot of line elements long interspersed
 

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:37.770
a lot of line elements long interspersed
repeat elements we have 10 to the 4th to

01:04:37.770 --> 01:04:37.780
repeat elements we have 10 to the 4th to
 

01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:39.510
repeat elements we have 10 to the 4th to
10 to the five of these these are about

01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:39.520
10 to the five of these these are about
 

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:41.880
10 to the five of these these are about
twenty percent of our genome they have

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:41.890
twenty percent of our genome they have
 

01:04:41.890 --> 01:04:45.410
twenty percent of our genome they have
no ltrs but they do have this repeated

01:04:45.410 --> 01:04:45.420
no ltrs but they do have this repeated
 

01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:47.940
no ltrs but they do have this repeated
cellular sequence which suggests that it

01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:47.950
cellular sequence which suggests that it
 

01:04:47.950 --> 01:04:51.180
cellular sequence which suggests that it
occurred by integration and they also

01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:51.190
occurred by integration and they also
 

01:04:51.190 --> 01:04:53.790
occurred by integration and they also
have sequences in the middle and blue

01:04:53.790 --> 01:04:53.800
have sequences in the middle and blue
 

01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:56.790
have sequences in the middle and blue
here with homology to RT and gag and

01:04:56.790 --> 01:04:56.800
here with homology to RT and gag and
 

01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:59.190
here with homology to RT and gag and
envelope and all of that so these are

01:04:59.190 --> 01:04:59.200
envelope and all of that so these are
 

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:00.900
envelope and all of that so these are
probably these have probably been

01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:00.910
probably these have probably been
 

01:05:00.910 --> 01:05:02.820
probably these have probably been
produced by reverse transcription and

01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:02.830
produced by reverse transcription and
 

01:05:02.830 --> 01:05:05.190
produced by reverse transcription and
integration as we would suggest here and

01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:05.200
integration as we would suggest here and
 

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:06.600
integration as we would suggest here and
there are others too as well there's

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:06.610
there are others too as well there's
 

01:05:06.610 --> 01:05:10.410
there are others too as well there's

01:05:12.490 --> 01:05:15.300
the 5 to 10 to the 6th of those in our
genomes and then we have these things

01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:15.310
genomes and then we have these things
 

01:05:15.310 --> 01:05:17.130
genomes and then we have these things
called process pseudogenes these are

01:05:17.130 --> 01:05:17.140
called process pseudogenes these are
 

01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:20.250
called process pseudogenes these are
very interesting they look like they are

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:20.260
very interesting they look like they are
 

01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:22.650
very interesting they look like they are
cellular genes that were reversed

01:05:22.650 --> 01:05:22.660
cellular genes that were reversed
 

01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:24.540
cellular genes that were reversed
transcribed and then were integrated

01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:24.550
transcribed and then were integrated
 

01:05:24.550 --> 01:05:27.090
transcribed and then were integrated
into the genome now because we have all

01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:27.100
into the genome now because we have all
 

01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:29.400
into the genome now because we have all
of these say line elements we actually

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:29.410
of these say line elements we actually
 

01:05:29.410 --> 01:05:32.220
of these say line elements we actually
have proteins that can be reversed

01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:32.230
have proteins that can be reversed
 

01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:34.770
have proteins that can be reversed
transcript cases so many cells have

01:05:34.770 --> 01:05:34.780
transcript cases so many cells have
 

01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:37.080
transcript cases so many cells have
reverse transcriptase very low level

01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:37.090
reverse transcriptase very low level
 

01:05:37.090 --> 01:05:38.820
reverse transcriptase very low level
reverse transcriptase activity in them

01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:38.830
reverse transcriptase activity in them
 

01:05:38.830 --> 01:05:40.290
reverse transcriptase activity in them
they don't make particles but that can

01:05:40.290 --> 01:05:40.300
they don't make particles but that can
 

01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:43.020
they don't make particles but that can
copy mRNAs which can then get integrated

01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:43.030
copy mRNAs which can then get integrated
 

01:05:43.030 --> 01:05:45.870
copy mRNAs which can then get integrated
and that's how these process pseudogenes

01:05:45.870 --> 01:05:45.880
and that's how these process pseudogenes
 

01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:49.200
and that's how these process pseudogenes
our eyes and this these all of these

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:49.210

for all these retro elements i should

01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:52.810
for all these retro elements i should
 

01:05:52.810 --> 01:05:54.930
for all these retro elements i should
say have been classified according to

01:05:54.930 --> 01:05:54.940
say have been classified according to
 

01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:57.000
say have been classified according to
what kinds of retroviruses they come

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:57.010
what kinds of retroviruses they come
 

01:05:57.010 --> 01:05:59.790
what kinds of retroviruses they come
from so they're retroviruses divided

01:05:59.790 --> 01:05:59.800
from so they're retroviruses divided
 

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:02.730
from so they're retroviruses divided
into alpha beta gamma epsilon delta thus

01:06:02.730 --> 01:06:02.740
into alpha beta gamma epsilon delta thus
 

01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:05.790
into alpha beta gamma epsilon delta thus
puma the foamy retroviruses and these

01:06:05.790 --> 01:06:05.800
puma the foamy retroviruses and these
 

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:09.180
puma the foamy retroviruses and these
are all endogenous retroviruses that are

01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:09.190
are all endogenous retroviruses that are
 

01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:10.650
are all endogenous retroviruses that are
related to each of those so you can see

01:06:10.650 --> 01:06:10.660
related to each of those so you can see
 

01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:13.680
related to each of those so you can see
there are endogenous lentiviruses in

01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:13.690
there are endogenous lentiviruses in
 

01:06:13.690 --> 01:06:15.930
there are endogenous lentiviruses in

endogenous HIV and how it got it we

01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:28.630
endogenous HIV and how it got it we
 

01:06:28.630 --> 01:06:31.170

has been infected with HIV we wouldn't

01:06:55.950 --> 01:06:55.960
has been infected with HIV we wouldn't
 

01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:57.090
has been infected with HIV we wouldn't
know it because we're not screening

01:06:57.090 --> 01:06:57.100

everyone but that person if he or she
 

01:06:59.950 --> 01:07:03.210
everyone but that person if he or she
survives could give rise to people who

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:12.660
genomes only takes one infection and
then that individual propagates and you

01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:12.670
then that individual propagates and you
 

01:07:12.670 --> 01:07:15.060
then that individual propagates and you
get endogenous transfer now this is all

01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:15.070
get endogenous transfer now this is all
 

01:07:15.070 --> 01:07:18.120
get endogenous transfer now this is all
being exemplified right now on earth the

01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:18.130
being exemplified right now on earth the
 

01:07:18.130 --> 01:07:20.580

Koala now the Koala is a very

01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:20.590
Koala now the Koala is a very
 

01:07:20.590 --> 01:07:22.830
Koala now the Koala is a very
interesting animal there are a lot of

01:07:22.830 --> 01:07:22.840
interesting animal there are a lot of
 

01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:25.380
interesting animal there are a lot of
them in Japanese zoos and most of them

01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:25.390
them in Japanese zoos and most of them
 

01:07:25.390 --> 01:07:27.390
them in Japanese zoos and most of them
are infected with a koala retrovirus

01:07:27.390 --> 01:07:27.400
are infected with a koala retrovirus
 

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:30.330
are infected with a koala retrovirus
that is endogenous their germline and

01:07:30.330 --> 01:07:30.340
that is endogenous their germline and
 

01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:32.910
that is endogenous their germline and
it's thought that this hurts the koalas

01:07:32.910 --> 01:07:32.920
it's thought that this hurts the koalas
 

01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:35.100
it's thought that this hurts the koalas
so it's not good so it's being studied a

01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:35.110
so it's not good so it's being studied a
 

01:07:35.110 --> 01:07:38.040
so it's not good so it's being studied a
lot the koalas all came from Australia

01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:38.050
lot the koalas all came from Australia
 

01:07:38.050 --> 01:07:41.460
lot the koalas all came from Australia
and they're in the South there are still

01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:41.470
and they're in the South there are still
 

01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:44.280
and they're in the South there are still
colony of koalas without retrovirus in

01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:44.290
colony of koalas without retrovirus in
 

01:07:44.290 --> 01:07:45.900
colony of koalas without retrovirus in
their genomes so these animals are being

01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:45.910
their genomes so these animals are being
 

01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:48.480
their genomes so these animals are being
infected in real time or i should say

01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:48.490
infected in real time or i should say
 

01:07:48.490 --> 01:07:50.190
infected in real time or i should say
what happened was a number of years ago

01:07:50.190 --> 01:07:50.200
what happened was a number of years ago
 

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:53.310
what happened was a number of years ago
a koala was infected the retrovirus went

01:07:53.310 --> 01:07:53.320
a koala was infected the retrovirus went
 

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:55.640
a koala was infected the retrovirus went
into its germline and now that is

01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:55.650
into its germline and now that is
 

01:07:55.650 --> 01:07:57.900
into its germline and now that is
propagating throughout the species so

01:07:57.900 --> 01:07:57.910
propagating throughout the species so
 

01:07:57.910 --> 01:08:00.330
propagating throughout the species so
you know most of the koalas in the

01:08:00.330 --> 01:08:00.340
you know most of the koalas in the
 

01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:02.520
you know most of the koalas in the
japanese ooh came from an individual in

had already been in dodgin eyes so this
 

01:08:06.050 --> 01:08:07.930
had already been in dodgin eyes so this
is a very interesting story if you're

is a very interesting story if you're
 

01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:09.880
is a very interesting story if you're
interested I wrote about it and there

01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:09.890
interested I wrote about it and there
 

01:08:09.890 --> 01:08:11.050

we've talked only about endogenous

01:08:16.590 --> 01:08:16.600
we've talked only about endogenous
 

01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:19.690
we've talked only about endogenous
retroviruses and in fact as I said for a

01:08:19.690 --> 01:08:19.700
retroviruses and in fact as I said for a
 

01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:21.280
retroviruses and in fact as I said for a
long time we thought these were the only

01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:21.290
long time we thought these were the only
 

01:08:21.290 --> 01:08:24.160
long time we thought these were the only
viral fossils we had but now in the past

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:24.170

year since we're sequencing so many
 

01:08:26.029 --> 01:08:28.329
year since we're sequencing so many
genomes and people just look at these

01:08:28.329 --> 01:08:28.339
genomes and people just look at these
 

01:08:28.339 --> 01:08:30.780
genomes and people just look at these
sequences they have been finding

01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:30.790
sequences they have been finding
 

01:08:30.790 --> 01:08:33.999

01:08:37.549 --> 01:08:39.880
other viral genomes not entire genomes
just pieces of them and these include

01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:39.890
just pieces of them and these include
 

01:08:39.890 --> 01:08:41.800
just pieces of them and these include

them not whole virus genomes integrate

01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:52.130
them not whole virus genomes integrate
 

01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:54.610

species now why is this interesting

01:08:57.729 --> 01:08:57.739
species now why is this interesting
 

01:08:57.739 --> 01:09:00.459
species now why is this interesting
because you can date the origin of these

01:09:00.459 --> 01:09:00.469
because you can date the origin of these
 

01:09:00.469 --> 01:09:03.459
because you can date the origin of these
viruses if you take a phylogenetic tree

01:09:03.459 --> 01:09:03.469
viruses if you take a phylogenetic tree
 

01:09:03.469 --> 01:09:06.459
viruses if you take a phylogenetic tree
and search it for the presence of these

01:09:06.459 --> 01:09:06.469
and search it for the presence of these
 

01:09:06.469 --> 01:09:08.530
and search it for the presence of these
integrated copies you can determine when

01:09:08.530 --> 01:09:08.540
integrated copies you can determine when
 

01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:11.229
integrated copies you can determine when
those viruses went into that species and

01:09:11.229 --> 01:09:11.239
those viruses went into that species and
 

01:09:11.239 --> 01:09:13.479
those viruses went into that species and
from this it's been possible to date

01:09:13.479 --> 01:09:13.489
from this it's been possible to date
 

01:09:13.489 --> 01:09:16.030
from this it's been possible to date
some of the origin of these viruses and

01:09:16.030 --> 01:09:16.040
some of the origin of these viruses and
 

01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:19.269
some of the origin of these viruses and
from 10 to 20 to 30 or 40 million years

01:09:19.269 --> 01:09:19.279
from 10 to 20 to 30 or 40 million years
 

01:09:19.279 --> 01:09:21.420
from 10 to 20 to 30 or 40 million years
ago so these are just probably

01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:21.430
ago so these are just probably
 

01:09:21.430 --> 01:09:24.599
ago so these are just probably
accidental occurrences for an RNA virus

01:09:24.599 --> 01:09:24.609
accidental occurrences for an RNA virus
 

01:09:24.609 --> 01:09:26.650
accidental occurrences for an RNA virus
infects a cell there's a little reverse

01:09:26.650 --> 01:09:26.660
infects a cell there's a little reverse
 

01:09:26.660 --> 01:09:28.510
infects a cell there's a little reverse
transcriptase made in that cell it

01:09:28.510 --> 01:09:28.520
transcriptase made in that cell it
 

01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:31.059
transcriptase made in that cell it
copies the viral RNA into DNA and that

01:09:31.059 --> 01:09:31.069
copies the viral RNA into DNA and that
 

01:09:31.069 --> 01:09:33.070
copies the viral RNA into DNA and that
accidentally integrates so it probably

01:09:33.070 --> 01:09:33.080
accidentally integrates so it probably
 

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:35.559
accidentally integrates so it probably
has no consequence in the viral life

01:09:35.559 --> 01:09:35.569
has no consequence in the viral life
 

01:09:35.569 --> 01:09:38.470
has no consequence in the viral life
cycle but it gives us an ability to to

01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:38.480
cycle but it gives us an ability to to
 

01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:40.570
cycle but it gives us an ability to to
put a time clock on the origin of

01:09:40.570 --> 01:09:40.580
put a time clock on the origin of
 

01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:44.200
put a time clock on the origin of
viruses now reverse transcriptase has

01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:44.210
viruses now reverse transcriptase has
 

01:09:44.210 --> 01:09:46.930
viruses now reverse transcriptase has
also been found in Mixel bacteria these

01:09:46.930 --> 01:09:46.940
also been found in Mixel bacteria these
 

01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:48.700
also been found in Mixel bacteria these
are primitive bacteria that live in the

01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:48.710
are primitive bacteria that live in the
 

01:09:48.710 --> 01:09:53.110
are primitive bacteria that live in the
soil ecoli and archaea they all have

01:09:53.110 --> 01:09:53.120
soil ecoli and archaea they all have
 

01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:55.360
soil ecoli and archaea they all have
reverse transcriptase activity the same

01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:55.370
reverse transcriptase activity the same
 

01:09:55.370 --> 01:09:56.920
reverse transcriptase activity the same
kind of activity we've talked about

01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:56.930
kind of activity we've talked about
 

01:09:56.930 --> 01:10:00.280
kind of activity we've talked about
today so it is probable that this enzyme

01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:00.290
today so it is probable that this enzyme
 

01:10:00.290 --> 01:10:04.060
today so it is probable that this enzyme
involved before these these separated

01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:04.070
involved before these these separated
 

01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:06.490
involved before these these separated
evolutionarily the archaea prokaryotes

01:10:06.490 --> 01:10:06.500
evolutionarily the archaea prokaryotes
 

01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:08.590
evolutionarily the archaea prokaryotes
and eukaryotes so it's a very old enzyme

01:10:08.590 --> 01:10:08.600
and eukaryotes so it's a very old enzyme
 

01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:11.470
and eukaryotes so it's a very old enzyme
most likely and in fact it is believed

01:10:11.470 --> 01:10:11.480
most likely and in fact it is believed
 

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:13.479
most likely and in fact it is believed
to be the bridge between the RNA world

01:10:13.479 --> 01:10:13.489
to be the bridge between the RNA world
 

01:10:13.489 --> 01:10:15.850
to be the bridge between the RNA world
in today's world to remember there was

01:10:15.850 --> 01:10:15.860
in today's world to remember there was
 

01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:17.830
in today's world to remember there was
it's postulated that there was

01:10:17.830 --> 01:10:17.840
it's postulated that there was
 

01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:21.040
it's postulated that there was
era where all organisms were composed of

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:21.050
era where all organisms were composed of
 

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:24.130
era where all organisms were composed of
RNA for their genetic material at some

01:10:24.130 --> 01:10:24.140
RNA for their genetic material at some
 

01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:26.380
RNA for their genetic material at some
point that was replaced by a DNA world

01:10:26.380 --> 01:10:26.390
point that was replaced by a DNA world
 

01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:28.930
point that was replaced by a DNA world
and of course an RT would be the

01:10:28.930 --> 01:10:28.940
and of course an RT would be the
 

01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:30.400
and of course an RT would be the
candidate enzyme to do the

01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:30.410
candidate enzyme to do the
 

01:10:30.410 --> 01:10:32.830
candidate enzyme to do the
transformation it could copy RNA into

01:10:32.830 --> 01:10:32.840
transformation it could copy RNA into
 

01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:34.600
transformation it could copy RNA into
DNA which eventually could propagate it

01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:34.610
DNA which eventually could propagate it
 

01:10:34.610 --> 01:10:36.190
DNA which eventually could propagate it
on his own so these are really old

01:10:36.190 --> 01:10:36.200
on his own so these are really old
 

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:38.920
on his own so these are really old
enzymes and may explain this very

01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:38.930
enzymes and may explain this very
 

01:10:38.930 --> 01:10:47.370
enzymes and may explain this very
interesting transition
