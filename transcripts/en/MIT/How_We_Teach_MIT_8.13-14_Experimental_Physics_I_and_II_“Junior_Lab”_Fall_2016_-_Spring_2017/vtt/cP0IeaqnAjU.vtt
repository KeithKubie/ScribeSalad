EFETOBORE TASKER: I would
say that the key to success

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.100
for Junior Lab for
me was simply having

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.290
the perseverance to continue
to work and to get things done.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.230
Because as I said, I hadn't
done a class like this before

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.089
or I haven't done anything
experimental in physics before.

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:21.380
So a lot of this was new to me.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.126
And I found it very
difficult at first.

00:00:23.126 --> 00:00:25.500
But if you put in the time to
learn how to correctly take

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.430
data, to correctly
analyze data figure out

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.380
how to do error
propagation, things

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.560
like that, you'll
eventually figure out

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.470
a way to do it in a
way that's correct.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.090
Because they do give you that
background and that foundation

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.000
to teach you how to present
data, how to analyze data.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.990
But we just have to
take the time to learn.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.521
So I think that perseverance
was the key to success for me.

00:00:46.521 --> 00:00:48.520
SAARIK KALIA: Yeah, I
think one thing I actually

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.490
found pretty surprising
about the course

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.050
is I kind of expected
the hard parts to really

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.600
be like the measurements,
as opposed to the analysis.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.350
But I actually found it to
be the other way around.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.040
Like, obviously you have
to be attentive during lab

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.110
and know what you're doing.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.600
But oftentimes the
real difficulty

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.050
comes outside of
class, like doing

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.575
proper analysis of your data and
really knowing what's going on.

00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:16.450
And even a lot of the
times you should really

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.371
be doing analysis during
class so that you know

00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:22.120
if your data is good,
if your data is bad,

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.050
and adjust accordingly.
