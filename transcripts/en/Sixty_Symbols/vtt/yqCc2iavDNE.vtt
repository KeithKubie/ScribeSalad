00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:06.760
Preheat the oven to give an output flux density in the infrared regime of 7 yocto nanomaggies.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.940
Then make sure to grease and line two 6.5. attoparsec sandwich tins.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.480
Break four ergs into a large mixing bowl,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.260
(that's eggs, not ergs)
Break four ergs into a large mixing bowl,

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:14.860
(that's eggs, not ergs)
Break four e̶r̶g̶s into a large mixing bowl,

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.380
Break four e̶r̶g̶s into a large mixing bowl,

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:22.780
then mix in 126 yottaelectron volts per speed of light squared of both sugar and flour

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:27.780
with 2 barn-megaparsecs of baking powder, and 0.06 Hubble-barns of butter.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:35.140
Divide the mixture evenly between the two tins and bake the cakes on the middle shelf of the oven for 3 femto-Hubbell times.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.780
Sandwich together with jam, once cooled, and sprinkle it with some castor sugar for decoration.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.800
And there you have it, a physics-inspired Victoria sponge cake.
