MALE SPEAKER: Welcome everyone.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.840
Anyone who has read "An Annual
Letter of Berkshire Hathaway"

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.620
has often come away marveling
at Warren Buffett's ability

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:20.130
to distill complex concepts
into very intuitive language.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.560
Our speaker for
today, Mohnish Pabrai,

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.940
is someone who paid
$650,000 for a lunch

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.860
with Warren Buffett in 2007.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.620
It's a sum he calls a bargain.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.570
And in the same spirit as Warren
Buffett and Charlie Munger,

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.070
he has a very intuitive, very
evocative, very emotionally

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.710
appealing way of
distilling complex concepts

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.700
into his form of connecting
with the audience.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.860
He is probably a
fantastic teacher,

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.070
although he does not
carry that official title,

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.500
if you go by any of
his presentations

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.780
to various university groups.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.730
Our speaker from last
time, Michael Mauboussin

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.290
spoke about the role of
luck and skill in life.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.280
He spoke about how
there is not often

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.120
a linear cause and effect
chain, but a spectrum

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.970
of probabilistic
outcomes in life.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.990
Mohnish takes that
one step further.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.190
He talks about
being preferential

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.540
towards probabilistic
scenarios where

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.210
you have a limited downside,
but a disproportionately

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.020
high upside.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.700
Also I could go on and on
about his investing philosophy,

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.330
his philanthropic activities,
so on and so forth.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.480
But I think what we'll
see here is how he really

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.770
cares about connecting
with the audience

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.460
and how good of a teacher he is.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.610
So without further ado,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.450
please join me in
welcoming Mohnish Pabrai.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.432
MOHNISH PABRAI: Thank you.

00:02:01.432 --> 00:02:02.140
Thank you, Sarab.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.100
That's a wonderful warm welcome.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.680
Very much appreciated.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.040
And it's pretty
exciting for me when

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.854
we got the e-mail from
Sarab about the possibility

00:02:14.854 --> 00:02:15.770
of speaking at Google.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.370
Because it's easy to be a fan.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.340
And I think it's a
wonderful company.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.850
In fact, I think in many ways
in the end, when we look back,

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.890
I think Google might very well
be the greatest company ever

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.800
created, for a
variety of reasons.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.960
And one of your board
members-- he's not a friend,

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.680
he's an acquaintance of mine.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.230
And I'd asked him
a few years back,

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.670
so what's the next Google?

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:57.020
And his response, he instantly
said the next Google is Google.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.850
And I think that's
a great reply.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.530
Because I think that the way the
company is designed-- you know,

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.050
Warren Buffett always says
that investing in businesses

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.790
with rapid change are the
enemy of the investor.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.820
In many ways, Google is kind of
future-proof from that vantage

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.090
point, just because of
the way it's structured.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.890
And so it's quite exciting
to be outside the Plex

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.880
and look in and see all
the great stuff going on.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.410
So anyway, from a
number of perspectives,

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.140
I'm delighted to be here.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.660
And I'll always kick
myself for never

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.550
investing in Google stock.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.700
But there's still time, and we
might still get there one day,

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.320
so we'll see.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.140
So the Dhandho
investor, the book

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:56.910
that came out a few years
back, Buffett has a quote.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.050
He says I'm a better investor,
because I'm a businessman.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.900
And I'm a better businessman,
because I'm an investor.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.440
And in essence, that book,
the Dhandho investor,

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:17.300
is the expansion of that one
sentence into 100 plus pages,

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:21.060
basically delving into
that particular nuance.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:29.000
And the word Dhandho
is a Gujarati word.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.590
And do we have any
Gujaratis in the room?

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:32.520
Oh, we have one.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.140
One Gujarati?

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.640
All right.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.240
That's good.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.270
So people always think
I'm from Gujarat in India,

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.460
because I wrote a book
called the Dhandho Investor.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.660
And I have to always correct
them and say, I'm not Gujarati.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:54.300
I had a roommate from
Gujarat, and he--

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.110
when I was doing my
undergraduate in engineering

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.420
and he was also an engineering
major-- he used to disappear

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.720
on weekends, because
all his family,

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.036
extended family, had all
these motels, and laundromats,

00:05:06.036 --> 00:05:07.660
and gas stations,
and whatnot that they

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.460
owned in the Carolinas.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.310
And then he'd come
back on Sunday night,

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.190
and he'd be bursting
with all these stories

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.700
about the new investments
his family had made,

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.460
and all of the economics
of those investments.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.480
And then in the end,
he would finish and say

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.400
Mohnish, Dhandho.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.450
And that was his way of saying
that-- the literal transition

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.430
the word Dhandho means business.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.120
But the way the Gujaratis
use it, what it means

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.260
is, it's a way of doing
business where you basically

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:45.770
have upside with almost
a nonexistent downside.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.580
Which is the key to investing.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.640
Like Buffet says, rule
number one, don't lose money.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.550
And rule number two, don't
forget rule number one.

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:59.780
So that was kind of the backdrop
behind the title and the book.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:07.200
And Indians make up about 1%
of the population of the United

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.170
States.

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:09.870
A little over 3 million people.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:15.390
And the Patels, who
are from Gujarat

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:17.780
are a much smaller
portion of that 3 million.

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.220
My guess is they would
probably be less than 1/5

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:28.630
of 1% of the US population,
well under half a million or so.

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.810
And even though
they're that small

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:35.440
a portion, probably
more than 60%

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:40.040
of the motels in this country
are under Patel ownership.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:44.080
And that's a stunning
statistic, considering

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.870
that 40 years back there
were no Patels over here.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.200
So they went from
basically a standing start

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.950
to pretty much
dominating this industry.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.310
And they've moved up markets.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.390
So they used to be
at the lowest end--

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:01.200
the smallest 10, 20, 30
room type highway motels.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.472
And now, they're buying the
Marriott's and the Westerns

00:07:05.472 --> 00:07:06.680
and the Hiltons and all that.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.270
So they're kind of
moving up the chain.

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:15.780
And they came to the
United States as refugees,

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:19.990
and most of them came from
East Africa, from Uganda.

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:23.430
And at that time,
in the early '70s,

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:27.330
there was a dictator, Idi Amin,
who came into power in Uganda.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:32.480
And the Patels actually had
come to Uganda several decades,

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.390
more than 100
years, before that.

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:37.840
And they came mostly
as indentured laborers.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.610
But over time, using
their Dhandho techniques,

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.350
they pretty much
controlled large portions

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:46.420
of the Ugandan economy.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.890
And Idi Amin was very
pissed off about that.

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:53.680
And his perspective was
that Africa is for Africans.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:58.400
And so what he did is he
pretty much nationalized

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.200
all their assets and took over
all their personal property

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.376
and threw them out
of the country.

00:08:04.376 --> 00:08:05.750
So there was
stateless, actually.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:09.290
They really had
no state to go to.

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:12.870
India was reeling from
the Bangladesh war and all

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:14.370
the refugees coming
from Bangladesh.

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:19.310
So India actually refused to
take the Patels in as refugees.

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:21.640
England took some.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.720
In the United States, at that
time, the Nixon administration,

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.560
they were quite
familiar with the issue.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.834
And they were sympathetic
to the plight of the Patels,

00:08:29.834 --> 00:08:30.750
but they were limited.

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:34.679
So the United States took
in a few thousand Patels.

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:36.990
A few more thousand
came to Canada.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:40.929
And most of these Patels
who showed up in the US

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:43.200
in the early '70s
didn't have that

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.210
much in the way of education.

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:47.810
And the only money they could
really carry with themselves

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:51.090
were whatever they could
convert into gold quickly,

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:53.720
a few thousand dollars.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.940
So that they landed up
in the United States.

00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:00.695
And they really found that they
had virtually no skills which

00:09:00.695 --> 00:09:02.510
were of use to most employers.

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:07.100
They had a heavy
accent, and really

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:10.490
didn't have much
in terms of skills.

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:16.490
But they found that
motels, buying motels,

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:18.700
was a great way to go.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:23.230
And the reason they thought
that was because a typical Patel

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:29.450
family, at the time, could buy
a 10 or 15 room motel for well

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:32.840
under $100,000, maybe
$50,000 to $75,000.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:36.900
And the family could live in
one or two of those rooms.

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.900
And because motel
are labor intensive,

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.260
they would pretty much
fire all the staff,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.250
and the family would
do all the work.

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:47.720
So laundry, cleaning rooms,
watching the front desk.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:51.340
Everything was done by
different members of the family.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:55.470
And they became
low cost operators.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.820
They looked at every single
facet of the business.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:02.850
And so once a motel came
under Patel ownership,

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:03.770
two things happened.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:06.380
One is that the
operating cost dropped.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:08.430
And because the operating
costs were lower,

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:13.270
they were able to charge lower
rates and increase occupancy.

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:15.820
And so typically,
the Patel owned

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:20.040
motel in a particular area would
always do economically better,

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.520
in terms of cash flows, then the
other non-Patel owned motels.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.880
And as soon as they
had enough cash flow,

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.830
they would buy the second
motel, and then the third motel.

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:31.530
And they'd just keep levering
them and buying them up.

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:35.250
And we end up with the
result of where we are today,

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:40.180
where they pretty much
dominate the space.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:46.510
And that aspect to the way they
went about doing their business

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:48.646
has a lot of correlation
with investing.

00:10:48.646 --> 00:10:50.020
Because the whole
Buffet sentence

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:54.250
of being a good businessman
is a great skill

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:56.300
set to be a great investor.

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:59.790
And the particular
facet that they

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:04.520
followed was this notion
that I call "heads I win,

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.440
and tails I don't lose much."

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.090
So if you looked at the
economics of a Patel

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:12.130
buying a motel, typically they
would put $5,000 or $10,000

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:13.120
down.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.970
And most of it was a bank loan.

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:19.750
And if for some
reason they were not

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:23.220
able to manage the cash
flows, the banks really

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:27.400
would prefer not to take the
motel back, foreclosing it.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.090
They would prefer or do
what they did recently

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:32.900
in the financial crisis,
extend and pretend.

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:38.300
Keep the same guy running it
and hope that things improve.

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:41.210
So either way, the end
result was the Patels,

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:43.980
even with high leverage,
were unlikely to lose

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:44.690
their properties.

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:45.356
And they didn't.

00:11:45.356 --> 00:11:47.860
Because they were
smart operators,

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:49.930
they got nowhere near that mark.

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:52.550
And after a few years,
the banks actually

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:56.910
wanted to lend to motels
under Patel ownership,

00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:58.660
because they saw the
default rates and all

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:01.390
that were markedly
different than the rest

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:02.640
of the population.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.920
And so that worked out
quite well for them.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:14.350
And there's this
notion that it's just

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:21.450
the Patels that have this
tight-fisted way of operating,

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:23.650
and this "heads I win,
tails I don't lose much."

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:27.820
But it actually
is available to us

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:30.550
anywhere we look, and you find
it in all kinds of places.

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:39.020
So for example, if you look at
Richard Branson in England, who

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:41.780
is as far away from the
Patels as you could think of.

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:44.490
And if you examine
the way Branson runs

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:49.320
his different businesses,
they're very much in sync

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:53.110
with the Patel model
of operating with

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:56.340
"heads I win, tails
I don't lose much."

00:12:56.340 --> 00:13:01.710
So for example, before the
formation of Virgin Atlantic

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:04.390
airlines, Branson used to
be in the music business.

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.640
He was a publisher of music.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:12.750
And these different [INAUDIBLE]
like Boy George and the Sex

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:14.890
Pistols and so on were
some of the brands

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:18.810
that he had brought up.

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:22.370
So one day he goes
to his partners

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:26.950
and says that he wants
to start an airline.

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:31.550
And he wants to basically fly
between London and New York,

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:36.120
and that he thinks it's a
great market to go into.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.830
So his partners
were quite floored.

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:42.060
They said look, we're doing
very well in the music business.

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:43.870
We know nothing about
the airline business.

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:46.980
You need a jumbo jet to get
into the airline business.

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:49.640
And that jumbo jet costs
about $200 million.

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:52.659
We don't have $200 million,
and we don't know anything

00:13:52.659 --> 00:13:53.450
about the business.

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:56.090
So he says, well, someone
sent me this business plan.

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:57.300
And Branson was smart.

00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.840
He said that if an executive
in the music business

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:05.760
gets a business plan to start
an airline flying between London

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.470
and New York, you know
that this business plan has

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:11.350
gone to 300 other
places before that,

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:14.100
and got turned down at every
place that knew anything

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:15.850
about the business.

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:18.280
But he was intrigued
by the plan.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:23.110
And he tried calling British
Airways over the weekend

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:24.510
to try to book
some flights, just

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:26.805
to see what the customer
service was like.

00:14:26.805 --> 00:14:28.240
And he couldn't get through.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.390
So he said, well either
there's so much business

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:34.580
that there's enough there for
a second player to come in.

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:38.477
Or they're so bad
that a second player

00:14:38.477 --> 00:14:39.810
can come in and do a better job.

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:42.220
Either way, there's
room for that.

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:45.570
And then his partners told
him that, yeah, that's

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:47.140
all fine Richard.

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:48.740
But we don't have the money.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:49.810
We don't have the jet.

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:50.720
We don't have a jumbo jet.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.886
How are we going to do this?

00:14:51.886 --> 00:14:57.760
And so what he did is, he
called (206)-555-1212--

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:01.310
which is the
operator in Seattle--

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:03.090
to get the number for Boeing.

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:06.910
And they gave him the
Boeing main phone number.

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:08.940
And he called
Boeing, and he said

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:13.560
he wanted to speak to someone
who leases jumbo jets.

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.370
And they'd repeatedly
hang up on him.

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:19.754
And finally, he
got to some guy who

00:15:19.754 --> 00:15:20.920
would actually speak to him.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.880
And he said, look, we typically
have one or two customers

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.430
in each country.

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:27.820
We know who they are.

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:30.436
You're not one of the people
we talk to in England, goodbye.

00:15:30.436 --> 00:15:31.060
So he said, no.

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:31.560
No, listen.

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:36.650
Before you hang up, do you
have an old, used jumbo

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:40.130
that you'd lease to one of these
customers if they came to you.

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:41.770
He said, well, you're
not one of them.

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:43.510
But yeah, if they came
to us, we actually

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:45.050
do have an old
jumbo lying around.

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:47.400
He said, oh, well if these
people came to you, what

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.240
would it cost to
release the jumbo?

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:53.160
And so the guy mentioned
the pricing and such.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.160
He said, would you do
a short term lease,

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.180
because the jumbo is
just sitting there.

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:59.800
He said, yeah, we'd be
flexible with our customers.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:03.765
So he convinced Boeing
to lease him that jumbo.

00:16:03.765 --> 00:16:06.370
Because it was
just sitting there.

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:09.830
And then, in the
airline business,

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:12.640
before the plane takes off,
you've sold all the tickets.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:16.650
So your revenue comes in
before you've spent a dime.

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:18.790
And then you pay
for the fuel 30 days

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:20.380
after the plane has landed.

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:23.990
So it's a negative
flow business,

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:27.320
in the sense that you don't
need even working capital.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.170
And so he went
about advertising,

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:36.750
and got the staff hired,
and got everything going,

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:39.250
and got this airline
off the ground.

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:42.900
And if you think
about it, if someone

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:48.780
can start a business in a
tightly regulated industry

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:53.120
like aviation, with
very high Capex needs,

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:57.910
like needing these
jumbos, with no capital,

00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:00.550
then you can pretty much say
you can do that in any business.

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:01.280
Right?

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:04.569
And if you think about
the way Branson set it up,

00:17:04.569 --> 00:17:06.470
he had no downside.

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:10.660
Because what would happen
if the thing didn't work?

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.520
Well he'd just
return the airplane.

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.400
And it'd be a few
thousand dollars

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.339
in terms of tens of
thousands or whatever.

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:18.380
And his music
business at that time

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:23.084
was producing about $3 or $4
million a year in cash flows.

00:17:23.084 --> 00:17:24.500
So they had more
than enough money

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:27.500
to take care of
any eventualities.

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:30.530
And that's the
nature of Dhandho is

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:33.920
that you're making
these asymmetric bets.

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.680
And one of the
reasons why I think

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:40.130
Google is such a fascinating
and incredible place-- because I

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:43.130
don't think Sergey
and Larry ever

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:44.850
thought about it
in these terms--

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:48.595
but Google is the
ultimate, Dhandho business.

00:17:48.595 --> 00:17:50.720
And the reason it's the
ultimate Dhandho businesses

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:54.470
is if you look at, for example,
your self-driving cars.

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:58.016
So the self-driving cars,
the real Capex on that

00:17:58.016 --> 00:17:59.890
would come when you need
to build large scale

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:02.430
factories to produce
millions of cars.

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:04.700
It is not when you're doing
the R&amp;D for those cars,

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:07.240
or have a few
prototypes, and put

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:09.670
a few dozen engineers on
it, and that sort of thing.

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:12.850
So if you think of the
outflows or outlays Google

00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:15.900
has on the self-driven
car, I would

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.770
bet you're probably spending
more on food on the campus

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:21.240
then you're spending on
the self-driven cars.

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:22.990
And so it's an asymmetric bet.

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:23.490
Right?

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:27.050
It's basically if it doesn't
work, it has no impact.

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:29.350
No impact on cash
flows or anything.

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:31.300
And if it does work,
it's game changing.

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:32.300
Same thing with Android.

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.050
You know, a few
years back, Android

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:37.020
with a project like
the self-driven car is.

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:41.810
And it moved from being one
of those outlier projects

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:43.670
to very much central
and cash flow.

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:47.960
And then, even when you
look at your balloons

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:53.660
with the internet access, or
all the different other projects

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:57.240
that you guys are working on
it, basically each one of those

00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:00.730
has the potential to
be a game changer,

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:04.410
in terms of where
the world ends up.

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:11.090
But none of those have
costs associated with them

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:14.340
that have anything
to do with how

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:16.190
threatening the
company in any way.

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:16.690
Right?

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:19.877
I mean it's a rounding error
in terms of the cash flows

00:19:19.877 --> 00:19:20.960
that the company produces.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:26.620
So the fact that the DNA
of a place like Google

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:32.720
is able to do things which
are not in adjacent fields,

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:34.160
it's quite spectacular.

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:37.224
And most other companies
don't have the DNA

00:19:37.224 --> 00:19:38.140
to be able to do that.

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:40.980
And my two cents
looking from the outside

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:43.340
is, probably the
only other business

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:47.730
I see that has the ability
to do that is Amazon.

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:51.000
And I think in the end, you
will meet them head to head

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.660
on a number of different fronts.

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:56.160
So that's why it's
a great place to be.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:02.590
And the other notion I just
wanted of talk briefly about

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:05.900
is this notion of compounding.

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.537
So can we play that video?

00:20:08.537 --> 00:20:10.870
We'll just play maybe a couple
of minutes of this video,

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:13.136
and then I'll just
talk about it.

00:20:13.136 --> 00:20:14.132
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:50.081 --> 00:21:50.580
OK.

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:54.540
So you know this notion
about confounding,

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:56.960
and you saw that slide
with Albert Einstein,

00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:00.060
saying compounding is the
eighth wonder of the world.

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:05.510
There was this guy who
invented the game of chess.

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:08.590
And the King was so
excited about the game,

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:11.604
and became an addicted
player, that he

00:22:11.604 --> 00:22:13.770
told the inventor you can
ask for anything you want,

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:15.900
and it will be yours.

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:18.350
And the inventor of the
game just says, I just

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:20.790
want you to put
one grain of rice

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:22.430
on the first square
of the chess board.

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:25.450
And then put two grains of
rice on the second square.

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:27.990
And then keep doubling
the grains of rice

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:30.590
until you get to
the 64th square.

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:31.910
And that's all I want.

00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:36.090
And that emperor clearly
was not smart enough

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:37.820
to be employed by Google.

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:41.290
And he was mathematically
challenged.

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:44.127
So he basically got upset
with this inventor--

00:22:44.127 --> 00:22:45.710
I wanted to give you
all these things,

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:47.720
and this is all you
want, a bunch of rice.

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:48.770
So the guy says, yeah,
that's all I want.

00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:50.728
So he tells his treasury,
you know, measure out

00:22:50.728 --> 00:22:53.040
the rice for him, and
get him out of my court.

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:57.710
And after a week, when the
treasurer was still not done,

00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:59.190
he asked him what
the problem was.

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:01.000
He said well, you
know, it took me awhile

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.280
to run the calculation,
but we don't have the rice.

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:07.250
In fact, he said that there's
not enough rice in the kingdom

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:10.720
or even on the planet
to fulfill the request.

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:20.660
And the amount of rice, it
becomes 2 the 64 minus 1,

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:25.360
which is a long,
Google-ish kind of number.

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:31.490
In today's dollars, it's
about $300 trillion.

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:36.110
And I think that is
just about global GDP.

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:40.130
Actually, not global
GDB, but global wealth.

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:42.940
So if you took the wealth of
every man, woman, and child

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:45.750
on the planet,
that would be about

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:50.852
equal to the 64 minus
1 grains of rice.

00:23:50.852 --> 00:23:52.310
So that's the power
of compounding.

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:52.810
Right?

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:54.090
It grows dramatically.

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:58.630
And when I heard about Buffett
for the first time in '94,

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:03.610
he had been compounding for
about 44 years at the time,

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:07.490
from about 1950 to '94.

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:10.430
And when I looked
at the track record,

00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:13.130
it dawned on me that
he was moving basically

00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:16.810
to the next square in
less than three years.

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:21.470
He had averaged for the first
44 years about 31% a year.

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:26.240
So if you compound
at 26% a year,

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:28.710
then your money doubled
every three years.

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:31.780
And of course, if
you were doing 31%,

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:33.815
then you were going even faster.

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:43.760
So basically, that
is at the essence

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:46.770
of the genius of
Buffett and Munger,

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:51.920
is they absolutely understand
the power of compounding.

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.600
And they basically
have gone at it

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:56.400
with this very long
runway and such.

00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:01.420
And of course, if you look
at it from 1950 to 2014,

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:03.890
it is no wonder
that Buffet ends up

00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:05.400
as the richest
guy on the planet.

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:11.050
Because if you keep compounding,
that's what ends up happening.

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:16.150
So that's one of the
important takeaways

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:20.260
I took from the
learnings from Buffett

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:23.040
and Munger is that
you don't really

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:27.580
need to do extraordinary things
to get extraordinary results.

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:35.090
If you can double your
money every three years,

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:39.281
then a few doubles starts
adding some significant numbers.

00:25:39.281 --> 00:25:41.280
If you start with a million
dollars, in 30 years

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:42.155
it becomes a billion.

00:25:42.155 --> 00:25:44.460
If you start with $10,000
it becomes $10 million.

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:46.500
It's just incredible, in
terms of what happens.

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:49.840
And the doubling
every three years,

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:52.590
my way of thinking of
that was that if you

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:57.880
buy a stock at less than
half of what it's worth--

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:01.140
and you just sit on it,
and in two or three years

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:04.040
it gets to being what it's
worth-- lo and behold,

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:07.330
you'll have your
20%, 30% annualized.

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:09.330
And sometimes, you
might get it in a year.

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:11.170
And sometimes, you
might have mistakes.

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:16.390
And the blended result of all of
that ends up being where it is.

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:23.470
So I think compounding is
a very powerful notion,

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:30.840
very much in sync with the
whole Dhandho framework.

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:32.770
And one other thing
I wanted to mention

00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:38.850
is, just in the same kind
of mindset of Google,

00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:45.080
is that the market gets confused
between risk and uncertainty.

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:49.280
And it kind of confuses
one for the other.

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.660
And risk and uncertainty are
two very different things.

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:55.300
And in general, anytime
you get to a situation

00:26:55.300 --> 00:27:00.510
where risk is low, but
uncertainty is high,

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:05.250
in general, the odds are high
that the stock in question,

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:07.780
or business in question,
will be mispriced.

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:10.240
And it'll probably
be under-priced.

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:15.840
So that combination of low
risk and high uncertainty

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:16.980
is a great combo.

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:19.760
The low risk means that
your downside is limited.

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:22.670
And a good way to
think about that

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:30.462
is, for example, when Bill
Gates started Microsoft,

00:27:30.462 --> 00:27:32.170
people always think
about these companies

00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:35.560
being formed as being
highly risky ventures.

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:39.410
But if you really analyze it,
so when Gates started Microsoft,

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:43.670
he did not have a net
worth or assets or capital.

00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:47.910
So the fact that he
was taking a high risk,

00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:49.740
well, there's no
capital to lose.

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:54.230
So you can't really have risk
because of a loss of capital.

00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:56.780
And if you think about
the opportunity cost,

00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:00.770
so he had not yet finished
his undergraduate degree.

00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:03.610
At that time, with
the couple of years

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:07.470
that he had spend at Harvard,
his value in the job market

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:08.940
was very low.

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.940
So if he went out looking
for jobs and such,

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:13.150
people would not be willing
to pay him that much.

00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:16.650
And if the venture
did not work--

00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:20.000
so he moved to New
Mexico, starts Microsoft.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.010
And so if you think
about the notion

00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:27.180
that Microsoft doesn't work,
well, he goes back to Harvard,

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:28.920
finishes an
undergraduate degree.

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:31.170
And now, when he graduates,
he's got interesting stuff

00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:35.420
on his resume-- what he did
in New Mexico for a year.

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:40.020
So any way you look at it,
the startup of Microsoft

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:43.090
was almost risk free.

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:47.480
But the uncertainty related
to Microsoft was very high.

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:50.630
It could've been that
the company failed,

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:53.820
and whatever little
money he had was gone.

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:56.320
Or it could be that he could
have become the wealthiest

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:59.250
human on the planet,
which he did.

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:03.820
And so it's a very
wide range of outcomes

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:05.690
that could happened
to that point.

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:08.760
But the key thing was
that the risk was low.

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:12.790
And in fact, if you study
non-venture backed start-ups.

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:15.990
Non-venture backed
start-ups, like the Patels,

00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:18.070
do not take risk.

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:20.280
In fact, if you repeatedly
study businesses,

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:23.440
there's more than a
million businesses

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:26.160
that get started in the
United States every year.

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:30.350
Less than a thousand of
them are venture backed.

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:31.620
Maybe a couple of thousand.

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:36.800
So 99+% of businesses that get
formed in the United States are

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.680
not venture-backed businesses.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:43.242
And most of them follow this
low risk, high uncertainty

00:29:43.242 --> 00:29:45.200
principle when they get
going, like the Patels.

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.740
So it's important
to keep in mind

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:57.960
that, I think you can replace
capital with creative thinking,

00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:02.370
the way Richard Branson did.

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:03.840
And certainly, for
most businesses,

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:05.173
you don't even need the capital.

00:30:05.173 --> 00:30:08.610
And certainly in a knowledge
economy type business,

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:12.150
capital actually becomes
useless, if you will.

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:15.420
So I can keep going,
but I think with that,

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:18.580
what I'd like to do is
to really hear from you,

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:20.270
and just see what
you have in mind,

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:23.890
and maybe try to
address questions

00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:26.710
or comments along those lines.

00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:28.799
So I'll open it up for
all of you to talk.

00:30:28.799 --> 00:30:30.590
MALE SPEAKER: So thank
you so much Mohnish.

00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:31.465
MOHNISH PABRAI: Sure.

00:30:31.465 --> 00:30:34.880
MALE SPEAKER: And we'll open
up the floor for questions.

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:37.490
AUDIENCE: I have heard phrases
along the lines of "beware

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:42.170
of geeks bearing spreadsheets"
from people like Buffet.

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:45.100
Is there something specific
that technically-minded people

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:47.960
should be aware
of with investing?

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:51.585
MOHNISH PABRAI: I mean, I would
say that there are these-- what

00:30:51.585 --> 00:30:53.960
I just talked about with the
issue of uncertainty, right?

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:58.060
So normally, engineers
want to see precision.

00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:04.260
And you've got to
actually be open to things

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:07.150
where you may not
have all the answers.

00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:10.590
In fact, by
definition, investing

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:12.590
is a very uncertain exercise.

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:14.836
Because what you really
need to do is you

00:31:14.836 --> 00:31:18.090
need to extrapolate what the
future cash flows of a business

00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:20.580
are going to be, and then
bring them down to the present,

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:22.340
and then decide whether
that works or not.

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:24.370
And in many cases,
in many businesses,

00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:25.790
I would say that
there's probably

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:28.990
nobody on the planet, including
the founders of Google,

00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:31.687
who could tell you what
Google's cash flows are

00:31:31.687 --> 00:31:33.020
going to be five years from now.

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:38.750
But for example, if you could
put a floor on those cash

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:43.600
flows, then that might
give you a basis to invest.

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:46.130
Because you would say, OK,
I know what my downside is.

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:49.480
And floor on cash
flow is a lot easier

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.510
than actually predicting
the cash flows.

00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:52.010
Right?

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:55.040
And so if you can, with
a high probability,

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:56.950
start putting floors on things--

00:31:56.950 --> 00:32:00.190
So I think the engineering
mindset needs to change a bit.

00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:02.740
And to some extent,
actually, Google's done that.

00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:05.850
If you look at
your server farms,

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:10.020
you've gone with unreliable
hardware with high failure

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:10.960
rates and all of that.

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:13.430
And to some extent,
unpredictable times,

00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:16.140
and places, when
things can fail.

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:18.930
But that's built into the
engineering of the solution.

00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:21.030
And so you're able
to accommodate

00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:23.870
a high degree of uncertainty.

00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:25.670
So you don't know
which server is

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:28.094
going to fail when, but
I think statistically,

00:32:28.094 --> 00:32:29.260
you know how many will fail.

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:31.830
And you can kind of
design around that.

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:34.680
So I think as long as you
can deal with uncertainty,

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:35.630
with generally.

00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:40.420
And the second thing is
that, you're probably

00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:43.931
best off never touching Excel.

00:32:43.931 --> 00:32:44.430
Right?

00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:48.310
So Excel has nothing
to do with investing.

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:51.957
And so that might be
heresy at Stanford Business

00:32:51.957 --> 00:32:52.790
School or something.

00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:57.480
But the way to really
look at investing

00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:04.505
is that when you look at,
again, a business like Google,

00:33:04.505 --> 00:33:07.140
or Microsoft, or
Berkshire, you really

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:09.620
have to put yourself in
the shoes of the people

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:11.070
running the business.

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:14.560
And you have to ask yourself,
how do they run the business?

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:17.200
Do they run it through
a set of spreadsheets?

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.650
Or how do they run it?

00:33:18.650 --> 00:33:22.170
And I would bet that
most of these businesses

00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:26.830
are run in a manner where the
founders or CEOs are really

00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:30.490
looking at three to five
variables that dominate

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:33.670
most of their thinking,
and outcome, and direction.

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:36.230
And so, as an
investor, you've got

00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:38.550
to hone in on the
same variables,

00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:40.259
So if you can get to
the same variables--

00:33:40.259 --> 00:33:41.883
if you're going to
invest in Microsoft,

00:33:41.883 --> 00:33:43.360
you can get to
the same variables

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:45.156
that [INAUDIBLE] is using.

00:33:45.156 --> 00:33:46.780
And Google it you
get the same variable

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:48.780
that Larry and Sergey
are using, then

00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:52.410
you're getting very
close to trying

00:33:52.410 --> 00:33:54.550
to figure out what
the business might do.

00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:57.660
And from there,
you can extrapolate

00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:01.140
whether it's under priced
or fairly priced, and so on.

00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:02.990
So that's what I
would suggest, is

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:06.350
avoid the use of spreadsheets,
and avoid precision thinking.

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:08.860
AUDIENCE: Can you maybe
give us an example--

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:12.330
it may not be current-- where
you've looked at a business,

00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:14.920
looked at an
industry, and said, I

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:17.250
think if I want to
analyze this business,

00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:18.850
here are the three
variables that I

00:34:18.850 --> 00:34:20.310
think are the most important.

00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:24.584
Maybe an example from
past would help to--

00:34:24.584 --> 00:34:27.380
MOHNISH PABRAI: So a business
that I didn't invest in, or--?

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:29.540
AUDIENCE: It could be
something you invested in,

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:31.179
and maybe walk us
through, here are

00:34:31.179 --> 00:34:34.014
the three variables I
thought were most important.

00:34:34.014 --> 00:34:34.889
MOHNISH PABRAI: Sure.

00:34:34.889 --> 00:34:35.389
No problem.

00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:37.000
I think that's a good question.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.770
So a few years back, I think
this is probably going back

00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:47.270
more than 10 years, I invested
in a funeral services company.

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:52.210
So you know, like
the gurus say, don't

00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:55.980
invest in industries
of rapid change.

00:34:55.980 --> 00:35:00.625
Humans are very slow to change
the way we deal with our dead.

00:35:00.625 --> 00:35:03.870
It takes a few centuries
for that to change.

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:08.160
There's a small trend
towards cremations,

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:10.600
which you can kind
of adjust for,

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:15.400
but by and large, it's a
pretty steady situation

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:16.600
with cremations.

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:19.165
So there were these
two companies.

00:35:19.165 --> 00:35:22.890
They had done a major roll up of
the funeral services companies.

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:26.670
One was Stewart Enterprises,
which is based in Louisiana.

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:29.906
And the other was Service
Corp. And what they had done

00:35:29.906 --> 00:35:31.530
is they had bought
a whole bunch of mom

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:34.540
and pop funeral
service operators.

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:37.630
And a lot of it was bought
with debt, and some of it

00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:38.140
with stock.

00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:42.260
And so what ended up
happening is these companies

00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:44.150
were very highly levered.

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:49.930
And then they got
so levered that they

00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:56.130
started tripping confidence
on their bank debt and such.

00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:59.411
And when I looked
at the companies--

00:35:59.411 --> 00:36:03.480
I think when I looked
at Stewart enterprises,

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:08.500
it was trading at a little
less than $2 a share.

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:11.780
And the cash flows
it was generating

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:14.470
at the time were
close to $1 a share.

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:22.870
And it was fairly tight in terms
of their servicing the debt

00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:24.370
and all of that,
but they were still

00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:26.120
generating positive cash flow.

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:30.062
But they had lots
of assets which

00:36:30.062 --> 00:36:31.270
were not generating any cash.

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:32.978
And they paid significant
amounts for it.

00:36:32.978 --> 00:36:37.950
For example, they had bought
hundreds of funeral homes

00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:39.010
in Europe.

00:36:39.010 --> 00:36:43.060
And collectively, they were
making no money on those,

00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:43.560
and such.

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:47.650
So I thought that a
business like that, trading

00:36:47.650 --> 00:36:52.440
at two times cash
flows, was ultra cheap.

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.070
Because I said, you
know, what I'll do

00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:55.567
is I'll just wait for two years.

00:36:55.567 --> 00:36:57.650
And then, the amount we're
paying for the business

00:36:57.650 --> 00:36:59.710
will just be there in cash.

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:04.270
And what they started
doing after we'd made

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:08.970
the investment is
they announced a sale

00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:10.920
of a large portion of
the European businesses.

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:14.540
Which again, was
[INAUDIBLE] had no impact.

00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:17.200
But they generated significant
cash from that sale.

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:19.140
And then, they gradually
were able to start

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:22.940
to restructure some of
their loans, and interest

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:25.060
rates, and covenants,
and all of that.

00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:31.620
And in a few years, that
stock was at about $8 a share.

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:35.210
So that's an example of
looking at something.

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:36.730
Another one I'd
looked at-- there

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:39.930
was a steel company
called IPSCO.

00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:45.360
And IPSCO had these long
contracts to supply steel.

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:51.470
And if you looked at the present
cash flows and the cash flow

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:54.960
for the next two
years-- so I think

00:37:54.960 --> 00:38:00.490
they were trading at
about $90 a share.

00:38:00.490 --> 00:38:02.590
They had about $30
a share in cash.

00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:05.920
And the next two years of
cash flows were equal to $60.

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:08.310
And so, if you just
held it for two years,

00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:10.500
you would have the
full $90 in cash,

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:12.250
but you'd have the
entire business.

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:14.660
And it was really hard to
tell after two years what

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:17.335
would happen to
margins and cash flows.

00:38:17.335 --> 00:38:18.960
There's high uncertainty
on that front,

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:20.980
but I really didn't
care about that.

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:23.630
Because I said, we'll just
hold it for two years.

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:25.320
And of course, we
got to two years.

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:27.190
They actually got
the $90 in cash,

00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:31.840
and then they still
had the engine running.

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:35.290
And I think we made a 4x on
that investment eventually.

00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:40.230
So there's different models
and such that you can look at.

00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:42.590
But I would say that the
most important thing is,

00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:46.540
before you invest, you
should be able to explain

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:50.270
the pieces without
a spreadsheet,

00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:52.910
within four or five sentences.

00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:54.930
And typically, I write
down those sentences

00:38:54.930 --> 00:38:56.160
before I invest.

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:58.750
So if you're having a
conversation with someone,

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:00.660
you could very quickly
explain, look, here's

00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:05.200
the reasons why this
investment makes sense.

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.450
AUDIENCE: What are the
top five attributes

00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:10.550
of a successful investor
that you think are?

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:12.710
And second, unrelated
question is that,

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:14.829
does your investment
style change

00:39:14.829 --> 00:39:16.370
when you have control
over a company,

00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:19.200
versus you're just
another stakeholder?

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:22.280
And how that changes, and how
is that important for investment

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:23.180
point of view?

00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:24.390
MOHNISH PABRAI: OK.

00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:28.090
Well, we'll see if
we can get to five.

00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:31.710
Well I would say good
traits, or important traits,

00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:33.630
for being a good investor.

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:39.360
Number 1, the single most
important skill is patience.

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.110
So I think the thing
is that markets

00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:44.570
have kind of a way
of deceiving us.

00:39:44.570 --> 00:39:49.050
Because when you turn on CNBC,
and you see all those flashing

00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:50.980
red and green
lights, and all that,

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:55.940
it's inducing the brain to
think that you need to act now.

00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:59.180
And you need to act immediately,
when nothing could be further

00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:00.840
from the truth.

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:03.930
Buffet always talks about
having this punch card.

00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:05.800
In a lifetime, you
make 20 punches.

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:08.150
And each time, you buy a
stock, you punch it once.

00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:10.960
So in a lifetime, you'd make
20 investment decisions.

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:13.420
Which means that, if you
started investing at 20,

00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:15.190
and ended at 80.

00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:19.100
every three years, on average,
you'd make one investment.

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:23.580
And that is very hard
for most people to do.

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:29.110
And so the more you can
slow down your investing,

00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:30.900
and the more
patient you can be--

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:36.060
so the issue is that the time
scales over which companies

00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:39.530
go through change and such is
very different from the time

00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:43.100
scale with which
stock markets operate.

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:47.170
So you really have to not focus
so much on the stock market,

00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:50.600
and have a lot more focus on the
nature of change in businesses,

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:54.110
and be willing to be
in there for awhile.

00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:57.980
And like I told you, for
the compounding to work,

00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:01.380
you don't need to double your
money every three months.

00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:03.380
Even if you double your
money every three years,

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:06.460
or even every five
years, that's plenty.

00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:08.630
Because it's just a
matter of how many doubles

00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:10.740
you can get and such.

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:14.650
So patience is the
number 1 skill set.

00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:16.600
The second, I think,
important skill

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:21.010
would be that if you have
run a business before,

00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:22.690
it's a huge advantage.

00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:26.670
Because of the whole interplay
between investing and running

00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:27.170
a business.

00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:31.790
Because it's very important
to be able to understand how

00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:36.130
a CEO thinks, and the factors
are there primarily focused

00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:38.450
on thinking about, when
they're running the business.

00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:43.590
And that's hard to get to
with spreadsheets and so on.

00:41:43.590 --> 00:41:48.860
And I think another
very important trait

00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:51.350
for successful
investing is to stay

00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:54.660
within your circle
of competence.

00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:56.880
So I think Buffett
always says that it's not

00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:59.610
the size of the
circle that matters,

00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:01.910
but knowing its boundaries.

00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:03.060
It's absolutely critical.

00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:09.000
And Charlie Munger
talks about that.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.270
He gives a couple examples.

00:42:10.270 --> 00:42:14.330
One is, he says that
if in a small town

00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:19.270
you bought the
McDonald's franchise,

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:22.910
you bought the Ford
dealership-- Ford dealership.

00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:24.760
Gas station not so good.

00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:27.970
And gas station we
leave for the Patels.

00:42:27.970 --> 00:42:29.251
Low cost operations.

00:42:29.251 --> 00:42:29.750
OK?

00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:34.600
And then you want the best
class of office building,

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:36.710
and you want the best
residential building.

00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:37.210
Right?

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:39.044
So if you've got these
four assets-- and you

00:42:39.044 --> 00:42:40.459
don't need to own
them completely.

00:42:40.459 --> 00:42:41.940
You would own 20%
of each of them.

00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:42.640
Right?

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:45.460
So his perspective was
that if in Peoria Illinois

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:47.860
you own these four
assets, and you just

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:49.360
sat on them for
your whole life, you

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:51.360
would end up probably
quite wealthy.

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:56.250
And so you think about it from a
modern portfolio point of view,

00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:58.084
you would say, well,
you're not diversified.

00:42:58.084 --> 00:43:00.249
Everything's in one geography,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:43:00.249 --> 00:43:02.460
Yeah, but the odds are it'd
probably still work out.

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:07.820
And in fact, he has a
friend here near Stanford,

00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:12.200
John Arrillaga, who-- all he
did was bought real estate

00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:15.180
within a mile of
the Stanford campus.

00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:17.780
And I think Arrillaga
is a billionaire.

00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:20.770
And so what is Arrillaga's
circle of competence?

00:43:20.770 --> 00:43:23.120
You know, it's this small.

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:27.780
So the size of the
circle is not relevant.

00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:31.854
Staying inside the circle
is very fundamental.

00:43:31.854 --> 00:43:34.270
So I think circle of competence
is a very important trait.

00:43:34.270 --> 00:43:37.550
Another important trait
is margin of safety.

00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:42.840
So you buy things for less
than what they are worth.

00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:47.650
And then I think the final piece
would be what Ben Graham says.

00:43:47.650 --> 00:43:50.470
That you're not buying
a piece of paper,

00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:52.280
you're buying a
fraction of a business.

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:55.470
So if I were to think
about investing in Google,

00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:58.230
for example, the question
I should ask myself is,

00:43:58.230 --> 00:44:00.600
if my family had a
trillion dollars,

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:03.340
would I be happy
putting $410 billion--

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:05.610
is that what the market
cap is right now?

00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:07.140
$410 billion?

00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:07.640
Right.

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:11.590
So if I gave a trillion
dollars, would I be comfortable

00:44:11.590 --> 00:44:14.440
putting $410
billion into Google?

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:19.000
And if the answer is no, then I
shouldn't put $10 into Google.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.130
Right?

00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:25.500
So many times when people say,
what do you think of Apple?

00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:27.797
And they don't know the
market cap of Apple.

00:44:27.797 --> 00:44:30.380
So my question is, then why are
you talking to me about Apple?

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:33.435
You don't even know what
the company is for sale for.

00:44:33.435 --> 00:44:38.080
So if you're going to
invest, at a minimum,

00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:41.270
you've got to know what the
entire business is selling for.

00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:44.070
And would you be willing
to put 50%, 60% percent

00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:46.600
of your total family assets,
if you had that much,

00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:48.120
into that business?

00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:52.365
And if the answer is
no, then don't go there.

00:44:52.365 --> 00:44:56.590
And I would have been willing to
do that at Stewart Enterprises.

00:44:56.590 --> 00:44:58.954
At the pricing I was
looking at and all that.

00:44:58.954 --> 00:45:00.370
In fact, what I
would have done, I

00:45:00.370 --> 00:45:02.536
would have bought a whole
bunch of the debt as well,

00:45:02.536 --> 00:45:06.370
just to get total control
over the situation.

00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:08.624
And then, you know, just
sit on those cemeteries.

00:45:08.624 --> 00:45:09.290
They'll be fine.

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:13.791
Your second question was?

00:45:13.791 --> 00:45:16.825
AUDIENCE: If you
look [INAUDIBLE]?

00:45:16.825 --> 00:45:17.700
MOHNISH PABRAI: Yeah.

00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:19.870
So control is overrated.

00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:23.370
So people tend to think
that when they have control,

00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:27.130
they can sprinkle pixie dust,
and things will be great.

00:45:27.130 --> 00:45:31.560
And quite frankly, I don't
think that's the case at all.

00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:38.020
I think that there are
businesses like Amex,

00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:41.600
or Coca Cola, or
Google, and so on,

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:46.480
which are such high-quality
businesses that it's not

00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:48.150
so much the control
issue, it's more

00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:50.360
an issue of did you
enter the right price.

00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:53.107
And those sorts of things
that matter a lot more.

00:45:53.107 --> 00:45:54.940
AUDIENCE: But if you
talk about the passion,

00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:57.990
about what you are
doing right here.

00:45:57.990 --> 00:46:00.272
Like I think Warren
Buffet doesn't really

00:46:00.272 --> 00:46:00.980
care about money.

00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:05.730
He loves what he's doing, right?

00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:07.210
Do think that's
what you are doing?

00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:08.460
Do you love what you're doing?

00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:10.620
And do you think that's
really, really important?

00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:15.700
And do you think this
may become an obsession?

00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:18.220
Like from reading
"The Snowball" I

00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:21.290
have the impression
that investing

00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:25.420
become an obstacle of
Warren Buffet's family life.

00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:26.890
Right?

00:46:26.890 --> 00:46:28.574
How do you adjust that?

00:46:28.574 --> 00:46:29.490
MOHNISH PABRAI: Right.

00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:33.140
I would say that my
take is that Buffet

00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:36.200
is a very aligned
individual, in the sense

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:40.370
that he's absolutely
pursuing what he loves to do.

00:46:40.370 --> 00:46:43.220
He would be bored
out of his mind

00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:48.630
if you sent him fishing forever,
or sent him golfing, or just

00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:51.864
asked him to do all
these other things which

00:46:51.864 --> 00:46:53.030
he has no interest in doing.

00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:57.670
So I think that he loves
the game of investing.

00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:59.310
He loves more than investing.

00:46:59.310 --> 00:47:02.490
He loves actually buying
entire businesses.

00:47:02.490 --> 00:47:05.000
So he's absolutely
aligned on that front.

00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:15.350
The thing is, you can, I think,
optimize on some variables.

00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:20.020
So if you look at a person
like Gandhi-- Gandhi's son

00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:22.490
became a male prostitute.

00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:22.990
OK?

00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:26.090
And in fact, Gandhi
neglected his kids.

00:47:26.090 --> 00:47:28.140
So there could be
an entire debate

00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:34.570
we could have on whether
Gandhi had done the right thing

00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:37.780
or done the wrong
thing, with that.

00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:40.780
So to some extent, I think the
thing is that we are human.

00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:43.834
And it may well be that
a person like Gandhi

00:47:43.834 --> 00:47:45.500
could not have optimized
on both fronts.

00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:47.940
You have the same issue
with Nelson Mandela.

00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:50.402
So if you look at Nelson
Mandela's personal life,

00:47:50.402 --> 00:47:52.610
there's all kinds of issues
going on with the spouse,

00:47:52.610 --> 00:47:53.530
and so on.

00:47:53.530 --> 00:47:58.670
And in Buffett's personal
life, you had-- in fact,

00:47:58.670 --> 00:48:02.640
I always tell my
wife that Warren

00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:06.750
was given a mistress
by his wife.

00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:09.170
And I tell my wife that,
so that she's aware

00:48:09.170 --> 00:48:10.330
that that's an option.

00:48:13.690 --> 00:48:17.450
And so far she's not pulled
the trigger on that option.

00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:19.060
But there's still time.

00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:26.487
And so my take is that,
I think that there

00:48:26.487 --> 00:48:28.820
are many good traits on Warren
Buffett that have nothing

00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:30.170
to investing.

00:48:30.170 --> 00:48:32.600
I actually admire
the way he even

00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:35.120
raised his kids, and so on.

00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:38.520
But I think that what we
are probably best off doing

00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:41.690
when we look at these
kind of iconic figures

00:48:41.690 --> 00:48:46.900
is not focus on so
much the minutia,

00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:48.610
because you're
going to find things

00:48:48.610 --> 00:48:53.350
in the closet that will
make your skin crawl.

00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:55.070
But I think look at
the bigger picture

00:48:55.070 --> 00:49:01.380
and say, what can we take
from there that can be useful?

00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:03.490
AUDIENCE: So I notice
that you haven't

00:49:03.490 --> 00:49:07.510
talked about the
importance of the catalyst.

00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:10.380
I mean the catalyst
for the correction

00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:16.420
of the under-valuation of
financial assets such as stock.

00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:22.890
Neither does Warren Buffett
or Munger talk a lot about it.

00:49:22.890 --> 00:49:29.250
But some other value investors,
like maybe [INAUDIBLE], they

00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:35.450
insist that catalyst is
very important for bet

00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:37.500
on the value of stock.

00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:43.210
For example, I sometimes
experience buying a stock

00:49:43.210 --> 00:49:48.290
at a very role valuation, maybe
below the liquidation value.

00:49:48.290 --> 00:49:52.310
And maybe just several
times of the cash flow.

00:49:52.310 --> 00:49:56.330
But without a
catalyst, the stock

00:49:56.330 --> 00:50:00.600
could remain undervalued,
and maybe go down.

00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:08.020
And I just want to know
your understanding--

00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:11.610
your suggestions regarding
situations like this.

00:50:11.610 --> 00:50:14.930
What do you think about the
importance of the catalyst?

00:50:14.930 --> 00:50:16.930
MOHNISH PABRAI: For the
most part, you're right.

00:50:16.930 --> 00:50:20.330
I have ignored the
importance of a catalyst.

00:50:20.330 --> 00:50:22.960
I think catalysts
are not required.

00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:25.840
In most cases, value
is its own catalyst.

00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:31.640
And I would also say that
when you're buying businesses,

00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:38.630
let's say below liquidation
value, for example, in my book,

00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:41.260
there's no such thing
as a value trap.

00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:45.830
I think there are mistakes in
investing, but not value traps.

00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:51.170
So in the end, everything
is fairly valued.

00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:55.210
And so, to the extent
that you end up

00:50:55.210 --> 00:50:59.860
with a less than satisfactory
return on investment,

00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:04.550
it probably has less to do with
whether the catalyst is there

00:51:04.550 --> 00:51:08.180
or not, and more to do
it with just the nuances

00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:11.200
of intrinsic value
of that business.

00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:14.360
So I have actually
found, in many cases,

00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:17.360
that-- in fact, the
catalyst actually

00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:20.502
flies in the face
of uncertainty.

00:51:20.502 --> 00:51:22.960
Because if you have a catalyst,
you don't have uncertainty.

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:26.020
And just the nature of
the type of investor I am,

00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:30.130
I prefer to buy low
risk high uncertainty,

00:51:30.130 --> 00:51:32.490
and let the catalyst
work itself out.

00:51:32.490 --> 00:51:34.370
And it has, for the most part.

00:51:34.370 --> 00:51:37.870
I would say that form
'94-- which is what?

00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:41.910
Five years before I started
my fund, until 2013--

00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:46.300
before fees and all that-- it's
been a little over 26% a year.

00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:49.070
And that engine has
not needed catalysts.

00:51:49.070 --> 00:51:51.610
But there's more than
one way to skin the cat.

00:51:51.610 --> 00:51:56.755
And the Seth Klarman
format of investing,

00:51:56.755 --> 00:51:58.130
even though it's
value investing,

00:51:58.130 --> 00:52:00.120
because value investing
is a very big tent,

00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:02.730
is very different from the
Buffet method of investing.

00:52:02.730 --> 00:52:06.400
One simple difference is Baupost
has more than 100 investment

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:10.980
professionals, and at
Berkshire there's one.

00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:14.560
You might say one and
a half, with Charlie.

00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:15.200
But that's it.

00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:20.080
So I think there are many
different ways to skin the cat.

00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:23.900
A set approach certainly
has worked for a long time.

00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:25.890
But my personal
preference and approach

00:52:25.890 --> 00:52:27.530
is to not bother with catalysts.

00:52:30.349 --> 00:52:30.890
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:32.660
I have a two part question.

00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:36.730
The first is, we had a speaker
last week-- Michael Mauboussin.

00:52:36.730 --> 00:52:39.380
He talked about
untangling skill and luck

00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:40.767
in business and investing.

00:52:40.767 --> 00:52:42.350
And I thought it was
very interesting.

00:52:42.350 --> 00:52:44.020
He gave the example
of Bill Gates,

00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:45.996
and how his mother
knew someone at IBM,

00:52:45.996 --> 00:52:47.620
and that was part of
the reason that he

00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:49.504
was introduced to
that opportunity.

00:52:49.504 --> 00:52:50.920
Would you care to
comment on that?

00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:51.130
MOHNISH PABRAI: Yeah.

00:52:51.130 --> 00:52:53.110
But I think that there's
a lot of other people

00:52:53.110 --> 00:52:54.965
whose mothers know
all kinds of people.

00:52:54.965 --> 00:52:57.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:57.570 --> 00:53:00.410
Well I would say, yeah,
I would say with Bill--

00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:03.470
so if you also look at the
book "Outliers", for example.

00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:07.110
You know, he talked about the
10,000 hours and all of that.

00:53:07.110 --> 00:53:10.660
So Bill Gates-- a large part
of the success of Bill Gates

00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:13.070
was when he was born.

00:53:13.070 --> 00:53:16.440
So if Bill Gates were born
10 years before, or 10 years

00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:21.060
after, it wouldn't have
mattered who his mother knew.

00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:27.540
So I would say that timing
and such was definitely

00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:30.390
gave him tailwinds, very
significant tailwinds.

00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:34.800
But I would also say that the
Bill Gates, and the Larrys

00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:38.380
and the Sergeys of
the world, would

00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:41.370
tend to do well, even in
the face of headwinds.

00:53:41.370 --> 00:53:45.390
They would not do as well
as well as they have done.

00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:47.300
Because to do as
well as they've done,

00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:49.620
everything has to
line up perfectly.

00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:51.790
But I would still
say that you could

00:53:51.790 --> 00:53:53.800
throw Bill Gates
in the fish tank

00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:56.259
with a whole bunch of other
folks, and he'd come out ahead.

00:53:56.259 --> 00:53:57.925
AUDIENCE: The second
part of my question

00:53:57.925 --> 00:54:00.700
is, I recently saw a program
about the Salton Sea, which

00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:03.600
was a very popular
tourist area in Southern

00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:06.080
California in the '50s and '60s.

00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:08.580
And there was huge
investment in that area

00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:12.980
and what seemed to be very
little chance for loss.

00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:16.112
And then there was a flood of
1976 which decimated the area,

00:54:16.112 --> 00:54:17.070
and it never recovered.

00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:18.827
I'd like to get your
comments on that.

00:54:18.827 --> 00:54:21.160
Because, for example, if you
bought motels in that area,

00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:23.880
it would have been a total loss.

00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:25.830
MOHNISH PABRAI: That's
right, you know.

00:54:25.830 --> 00:54:27.705
Like I said, I think
the thing with investing

00:54:27.705 --> 00:54:30.130
is there are no absolutes.

00:54:30.130 --> 00:54:33.160
So you're trying to
make, what I would say,

00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:34.920
a high probability bet.

00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:39.220
And certainly, if you
are a Patel who's just

00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:43.520
left Uganda, with Idi Amin
breathing down your neck,

00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:47.320
and all you can do is
buy one motel, then--

00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:50.530
and that's the nature
of most business owners.

00:54:50.530 --> 00:54:54.520
Is in certain times
of their career,

00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:57.090
they will have extreme
concentration risk.

00:54:57.090 --> 00:54:58.650
And it's pretty normal.

00:54:58.650 --> 00:55:00.150
I mean, we have so
many bankruptcies

00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:01.757
that happen in the
US all the time.

00:55:01.757 --> 00:55:03.340
And many of those
are not their fault.

00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:09.350
They just happened to be just
in the dead center of a tornado.

00:55:09.350 --> 00:55:10.460
And so you get hit.

00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:13.570
So it's this just the
nature of the beast.

00:55:13.570 --> 00:55:17.570
So the good news you have
as a passive investor,

00:55:17.570 --> 00:55:19.890
is you can spread it out a bit.

00:55:19.890 --> 00:55:22.620
So I would say,
don't buy 40 stocks.

00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:25.990
But you could buy
four, or three.

00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:30.350
And even if you bought three
stocks after researching them

00:55:30.350 --> 00:55:33.150
properly, the biggest
asset you have

00:55:33.150 --> 00:55:36.770
is yourself, and your
ability to work at Google,

00:55:36.770 --> 00:55:38.760
and produce cash
flows, and so on.

00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:44.190
So you have another
ace in the hole,

00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:46.040
if you have that
sort of situation.

00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:49.590
So I think in your
particular circumstance,

00:55:49.590 --> 00:55:51.830
you don't need to
go all in one place.

00:55:51.830 --> 00:55:55.840
AUDIENCE: You talked about
the value investing tent.

00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:57.950
And you also talked
about 20 punches.

00:55:57.950 --> 00:56:00.360
And if my understanding
is correct,

00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:06.285
then the 20 punches naturally
causes Warren Buffett style

00:56:06.285 --> 00:56:08.880
of investing to look for
compounding machines.

00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:12.280
Because you have limited
time in your lifetime

00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:14.530
when you're going to identify
compounding machines.

00:56:14.530 --> 00:56:17.540
And in those times, he
has been willing to pay

00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:19.540
what traditionally may
not sound like value.

00:56:19.540 --> 00:56:22.520
For example, he paid like 28
times earnings on Moody's.

00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:25.740
And he paid 25 times on Coke.

00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:27.460
And there's obviously
the other extreme,

00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:28.980
of like the Ben Graham.

00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:31.520
Where exactly do you fall in?

00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:35.610
And have you felt the
urge, or the need,

00:56:35.610 --> 00:56:40.020
to say over your past career,
that I need to change my tent

00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:42.380
and move slightly
here, slightly there.

00:56:42.380 --> 00:56:44.260
What has been some
of the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:45.176
MOHNISH PABRAI: Right.

00:56:45.176 --> 00:56:47.590
Yeah, that's a great question.

00:56:47.590 --> 00:56:51.130
The best possible business
you could invest in

00:56:51.130 --> 00:56:57.680
is a great business that's
growing at a nice clip,

00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:00.760
and that has high
returns on capital,

00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:05.460
and one that can absorb
the capital it produces.

00:57:05.460 --> 00:57:08.420
That would be the gold standard.

00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:12.220
And probably Google gets
the closest to that.

00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:14.760
I would say even a
business like Coke or Amex,

00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:17.310
the problem is they're very
good businesses-- yeah,

00:57:17.310 --> 00:57:21.060
they're not able to consume
the cash they put forth.

00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:24.150
So those types of businesses,
which are compounding machines,

00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:26.394
which are able to
absorb capital,

00:57:26.394 --> 00:57:28.060
tend to be few and
far between, and tend

00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:31.450
to be ridiculously
overpriced, typically.

00:57:31.450 --> 00:57:35.310
Or at least on perception
bases, they're overpriced.

00:57:35.310 --> 00:57:39.690
So if you can't find that,
then you go to plan B.

00:57:39.690 --> 00:57:42.800
And Buffett has done,
even now he continues

00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:45.170
to do, plenty of plan
B type investing.

00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:51.220
So for example, he bought the
debt of a specialty finance

00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:54.437
company called FINOVA which
was basically just mispriced,

00:57:54.437 --> 00:57:56.770
and they were just looking
for that whole thing to being

00:57:56.770 --> 00:58:00.840
run off, and they would
make a return on it.

00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:04.980
But it's nothing
like Coke or Amex.

00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:10.310
So I would say, first
plan, compounding machines.

00:58:10.310 --> 00:58:12.580
You can't get that,
then you go to plan

00:58:12.580 --> 00:58:16.000
B, which is undervalued
assets, and so on.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:22.080
I have learned,
probably the hard way,

00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:28.700
that it's better to
put as much as you can

00:58:28.700 --> 00:58:31.990
on the great businesses
with great managers.

00:58:31.990 --> 00:58:35.780
Even if you pay up a little bit.

00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:37.780
But you know, old
habits die hard.

00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:41.180
We still like to have that
hunt for the extremely cheap

00:58:41.180 --> 00:58:42.600
business as well.

00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:43.394
And so it's a mix.

00:58:43.394 --> 00:58:44.560
I would say that it's a mix.

00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:46.660
And it just depends
on-- I'm flexible.

00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:48.830
I think it's very
important in investing

00:58:48.830 --> 00:58:53.240
to be a learning machine, and
to have flexibility, and to be

00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:59.140
willing to look at
the opportunity set.

00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:01.616
And decide whether you
need to do anything at all,

00:59:01.616 --> 00:59:02.990
or what is the
best thing you can

00:59:02.990 --> 00:59:05.910
do based on the
available opportunities?

00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:07.220
And then take it from there.

00:59:07.220 --> 00:59:10.287
So sometimes it can just be one
of these mispriced bets that

00:59:10.287 --> 00:59:11.620
plays out in two or three years.

00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:14.380
And maybe that can go into
a compounding machine,

00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:17.060
and so, and so on.

00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:20.280
Flexibility is a good
trait, but it's always

00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:22.810
good to get into those
compounding machines.

00:59:22.810 --> 00:59:26.909
I think those are
the holy grail.

00:59:26.909 --> 00:59:28.450
MALE SPEAKER: So
with that, let's all

00:59:28.450 --> 00:59:30.350
thank Mohnish very
much for the talk.

00:59:30.350 --> 00:59:32.200
[APPLAUSE]
