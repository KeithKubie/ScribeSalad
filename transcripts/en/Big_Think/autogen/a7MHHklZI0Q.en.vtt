there's actually really neat history of

there's actually really neat history of
exactly why and how a particular set of

half of the 20th century I'll give you
 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.380
half of the 20th century I'll give you
just one example but the idea of

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390
just one example but the idea of
 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.310
just one example but the idea of
operational management which was

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320
operational management which was
 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.979

Germany using statistics and actually
 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.880
Germany using statistics and actually
the applying statistics to analyze the

and then therefore making decisions
 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.370
and then therefore making decisions
based on statistics and so operational

that still is the one that we're

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939
that still is the one that we're

that still is the one that we're
operating under that came out of that

addition to this is one piece but it's a

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369
addition to this is one piece but it's a
 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.050
addition to this is one piece but it's a
very important piece that there's a

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060
very important piece that there's a
 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.580
very important piece that there's a

of media oh yeah we're actually you know

00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:46.499
of media oh yeah we're actually you know
 

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:47.870
of media oh yeah we're actually you know
in the process of breaking that apart

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880
in the process of breaking that apart
 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.940
in the process of breaking that apart
right here so this is good we we know

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950
right here so this is good we we know
 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.769
right here so this is good we we know
that there's a particular dynamic

00:01:54.769 --> 00:01:54.779
that there's a particular dynamic
 

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:57.469
that there's a particular dynamic
associated with the kinds of media that

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479
associated with the kinds of media that
 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.949
associated with the kinds of media that
are broadcast where one individual or

00:02:00.949 --> 00:02:00.959
are broadcast where one individual or
 

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:03.199
are broadcast where one individual or
group because of the nature of the

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:03.209
group because of the nature of the
 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:04.730
group because of the nature of the
medium so for example broadcast

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740
medium so for example broadcast
 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.859

the speaker and the listener and there's

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950
the speaker and the listener and there's
 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.640
the speaker and the listener and there's
no interaction and so I am in a position

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650
no interaction and so I am in a position
 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.470
no interaction and so I am in a position
of listening your two positions speaking

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480
of listening your two positions speaking
 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.750

and there's 30 million of me and one of

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760
and there's 30 million of me and one of
 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.030
and there's 30 million of me and one of
you right now that's actually a very

you right now that's actually a very
 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.640
you right now that's actually a very
important dynamic if you don't

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650
important dynamic if you don't
 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.620
important dynamic if you don't
understand the fact of that and its

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630
understand the fact of that and its
 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.760
understand the fact of that and its
importance you're going to have a very

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770
importance you're going to have a very
 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.950
importance you're going to have a very
hard time understanding what actually

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960
hard time understanding what actually
 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.570
hard time understanding what actually
happened is during the latter half of

television emerged as a dominant medium

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920
television emerged as a dominant medium
 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.040
television emerged as a dominant medium
displacing radio and newspapers and by

the Internet is now emerging as the
 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.770
the Internet is now emerging as the
dominant media replaced in television

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780

it's actually quite interesting that for

that is effectively the same thing as

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:22.460
them so what that will mean is two
things

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:22.470
things
 

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.830
things
one is the set of techniques and

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:24.840
one is the set of techniques and
 

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.730
one is the set of techniques and
approaches that socially evolved in the

approaches that socially evolved in the
 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.800
approaches that socially evolved in the
television and the broadcast era are

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:30.810
television and the broadcast era are
 

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:34.460
television and the broadcast era are
suddenly maladaptive in this new

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:34.470
suddenly maladaptive in this new
 

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:36.350
suddenly maladaptive in this new
psychological ecosystem and so think

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.360
psychological ecosystem and so think
 

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.640
psychological ecosystem and so think
like the Pepsi commercial that so

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:37.650
like the Pepsi commercial that so
 

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:40.190
like the Pepsi commercial that so
famously was a disaster right that's

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:40.200
famously was a disaster right that's
 

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.020
famously was a disaster right that's
very much the kind of thing that is

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:42.030
very much the kind of thing that is
 

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:45.650
very much the kind of thing that is
produced by a broadcast intuition and we

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:45.660
produced by a broadcast intuition and we
 

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:47.360
produced by a broadcast intuition and we
get to send messages and those message

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:47.370
get to send messages and those message
 

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:49.520
get to send messages and those message
are things that you can see but the

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:49.530
are things that you can see but the
 

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:52.520
are things that you can see but the
psychology and the technology of the

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:52.530
psychology and the technology of the
 

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:54.440
psychology and the technology of the
internet or of this the decentralized

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:54.450
internet or of this the decentralized
 

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:56.960
internet or of this the decentralized
asymmetrical medium is one of no no we

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:56.970
asymmetrical medium is one of no no we
 

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:58.760
asymmetrical medium is one of no no we
get to critique we get to directly

00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:58.770
get to critique we get to directly
 

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:02.060
get to critique we get to directly
respond to and things that feel like

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:02.070
respond to and things that feel like
 

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:04.400
respond to and things that feel like
they are broadcasters feel like they are

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:04.410
they are broadcasters feel like they are
 

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:06.440
they are broadcasters feel like they are
quite obviously intending to influence

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:06.450
quite obviously intending to influence
 

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:09.080
quite obviously intending to influence
us emotionally we know what that feels

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:09.090
us emotionally we know what that feels
 

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:09.290
us emotionally we know what that feels
like

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:09.300
like
 

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.880
like
and it doesn't it doesn't work anymore

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:10.890
and it doesn't it doesn't work anymore
 

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:13.040
and it doesn't it doesn't work anymore
so we're going to respond to that and

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:13.050
so we're going to respond to that and
 

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:15.200
so we're going to respond to that and
our ability to respond swarms around it

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:15.210
our ability to respond swarms around it
 

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:17.930
our ability to respond swarms around it
and breaks it up and so this for example

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:17.940
and breaks it up and so this for example
 

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:21.760
and breaks it up and so this for example
is I think at least a reasonably good

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:21.770
is I think at least a reasonably good
 

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:23.960
is I think at least a reasonably good
explanation for what's been happening in

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:23.970
explanation for what's been happening in
 

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:27.230
explanation for what's been happening in
the political domain over the past 30 or

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:27.240
the political domain over the past 30 or
 

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.870
the political domain over the past 30 or
40 years and certainly over the past two

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:30.880
40 years and certainly over the past two
 

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:34.120
40 years and certainly over the past two
