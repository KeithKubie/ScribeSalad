00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.980
Hello I'm the Nostalgia Critic, I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.200
Well, as Sequel Month is winding down to a close,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.180
We realize there are some good sequels out there,

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.900
but there's a LOT more bad ones.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.740
Why is that?

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.780
After all, the movie prior had to start from nothing and win people over.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.780
You could argue sequels have more of an advantage.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.660
It starts from something that people are already familiar with and enjoy

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.140
So technically that should mean that there's a greater

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.200
chance the film will connect with people because... It already has in the last one.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.360
Yet time after time we get dud after dud.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.440
Why does this happen so often?

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.420
*in-old-timey-voice* Well I may be an old-fashioned critic,

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.380
but I believe it comes down to 4 specific failures.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.920
The first one is:

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.600
There are certainly some things we expect to see in a sequel,

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.000
usually involving past characters or similar themes and moods.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.240
However, people want the story to continue, NOT be retold to them.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.860
A lot of folks want to see a character or a story they have grown attached to evolve.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.080
The reason for this is because they see something of themselves in the character,

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.500
and they don't want to just see themselves doing the same thing over and over.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.280
Movies like Home Alone 2, Hangover 2 and the Transformer films get a bad reputation

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.600
because there's little to no differences.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.160
We do want to see these characters again doing similar things to the previous film,

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.420
but not the exact same things.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.380
Just changing the location or adding one or two different elements doesn't make it a grander experience.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.800
Filmmakers often think that something bigger must be newer.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.280
And it's not. It's just bigger.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.500
Kevin being alone in a house fighting off burglars is funny and original.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.420
Doing the exact same situation just in New York

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.720
is the exact same situation, except in New York!

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.860
Both this film and Hangover 2 are so guilty of this,

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.060
that they constantly make references by reminding you that they already did it.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.820
*movie-lines* "It happened again." "Yikes I did it again!"

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.680
We get the joke that the situation is so crazy, it can't possibly happen again,

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.020
Yet, of course it does.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.320
But to have a whole movie dedicated to that idea isn't enough to hold our interest.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.420
Lost World, US Marshal, Speed 2...

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.700
These are just a few that fall victim to doing the exact same thing, just in a different location.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.800
And none of them are usually seen as fitting sequels.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.140
But most of these films were made relatively close to each other.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.680
Which brings us to our next big failure:

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.740
We've seen what happens when a film can be rushed out too fast.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.200
But sometimes waiting too long can be just as bad.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.020
Now don't get me wrong, sometimes waiting is good.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.820
directors and actors can improve their craft, new ideas can bubble, and the fanbase can grow.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.900
But most of the time, the exact opposite can happen.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.360
A director's talent fades, the ideas don't keep updated,

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.280
and an audience can either grow tired of an idea or become too obsessed.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.980
Take two giants like Star Wars and Indiana Jones.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.980
Two classic filmmakers returned to their groundbreaking franchises

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.840
after years and years of venturing into other genres.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.860
Time away obviously created a disconnect with their fanbases,

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.300
as most people didn't get into any of these sequels.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.980
Complaints of too much CGI, poorly written dialogue, and focus in the wrong areas

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.680
seemed to be major complaints for these films.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.000
Movies like The Godfather 3 and Blues Brothers fit into this category.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.840
The original filmmakers returned for one last hurrah, but nobody asked for that one last hurrah.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.340
The last film they left off on was fine,

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.420
no improvements or additions necessary.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:45.360
Because they let so much time pass, they both move slower, lacking energy and passion that the previous installments had.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.020
Possibly from the very real fact that the people just got older,

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.920
The director, writers and actors.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.980
Many performers can get better with age,

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:59.400
But as with most people, age can slow you down, very easily and not keep you open to what's new and also appealing.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.120
Films like Zorro 2, Clerks 2, and Terminator Genisys all have this problem.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:11.300
By the time the follow-up came around, nobody had the excitement to be sucked in to the same cast or creative team reuniting.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.300
Which I guess ties into the next big failure:

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.580
We've seen this happen alot with the Batman movies,

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.880
constantly going from award winning game-changers to laughably lame misfires.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.080
The creative team for Dark Knight Rises,

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.240
Batman V Superman, and ESPECIALLY  the Schumacher Batman films,

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.020
often missed what we liked to see with one of the most treasured superhero's of all time.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.120
Sometimes they focused too much on jokes,

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.000
other times they focused too much on blowing people away,

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.060
and recently they focused too much on Batman blowing people away.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.260
But while these films do still have some crowds who will defend them,

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.320
Films like Son of the Mask, Blair Witch 2 and Exorcist 2 do not.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.240
These are all movies that attempted to give a sequel that in some way tied into the original,

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.680
But completely missed what it was about the original that grabbed people.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.560
Son of the Mask tried to be too ugly and obnoxious,

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.620
Blair Witch 2 tried to be too complicated and weird,

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.600
even the director of Exorcist 2 admitted he didn't like the original that much!

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:17.240
Umm...is that such a good choice for someone to direct a follow-up to one of the most popular horror films of all time?

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.320
Films like Wolverine or the Matrix sequels also didn't connect well with their fanbases,

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.920
claiming they were too different from the original that they loved.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.060
Oftentimes they tried to do too much or too little,

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.800
either throwing a ton of story and characters at us,

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.400
or not enough for us to make any kind of connection.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:38.060
And not such a big shocker, absolutely none of these films that I listed made any God-damn sense.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:43.980
But probably the biggest problem that most people don't list doesn't even have anything to do with watching the film

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.780
It has to do with making the film:

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.800
Even if there is a long gap in-between making movies,

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.220
most films are still bound with a due-date.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.660
There are exceptions with films going over-budget and overtime,

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.280
But the fact remains it also has to come out at a certain point.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.060
Often you don't have enough time to find the appropriate actor,

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.600
or enough time to convince someone of the actor who would be better for the role.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:13.060
Commonly a location can only be used for a certain number of days or hours,

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.020
meaning not everything can be shot as intended.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.940
Other times there are just not enough test-screenings to figure out what to fix before the release date,

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.420
or time to go back and make the changes needed.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.540
A movie can even come out at the exact WRONG time!

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.660
It's A Wonderful Life bombed at the box office because it didn't come out around Christmas.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.320
UHF, despite previews going fantastically, came out during the biggest blockbuster summer in years.

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:43.280
Sin City 2, despite it being just as cool as the first, simply waited too damn long to keep the energy up.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.880
Sacrifices always have to be made when making a film because of time.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.700
Sometimes those sacrifices work out in the long-run,

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.580
but other times, there's just not enough to convince someone what a film does or doesn't need.

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.240
Perhaps there are more elements that go into making a bad sequel,

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.240
But these are the 4 that stand out the most.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.820
The good news though, is that if these are the downsides to making bad sequels,

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.780
then the opposite must be true of making great sequels.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.940
If repetition is too much, new material can be made.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.740
If a film comes out at the wrong time, then the right time must also be available.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.800
If the essence of an idea is missed, then somebody can recognize and fix it.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:25.360
And if someone is not willing to give enough time, there is someone out there who is willing to give more than enough time.

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:31.400
Sadly, it's easier to destroy than it is to create, but creation is what we value and often reward more.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.800
It takes more effort because its difficult to do,

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.860
thus we remember and respect them more because they delight and surprise us.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:44.780
Maybe its good that there's more bad sequels than good, because if we had more good ones, we'd be spoiled.

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.500
We wouldn't appreciate the hard work of the good ones,

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.780
nor praise them when they blow us away with their imagination, restraint and ingenuity.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.520
Are we ever going to get more good sequels than bad? Probably not.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.060
But honestly that might be the perfect way to have it.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:01.100
If we always knew the next one was going to be good,

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.800
then there would never be any surprises in the next part of our thrilling story.

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:08.140
*music*

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.020
I'm the Nostalgia Critic, I remember it so you don't have to.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.320
Hey, Doug Walker here doing the Charity Shout-out,

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:03.300
And this week we are doing the National Alliance to End Homelessness.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:07.900
This is the leading voice on federal homelessness policy.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:13.880
From advocating to improve federal policy to analyzing, enacting and propose legislation,

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:24.040
The Alliance works collaboratively with public, private and non-profit partners to develop, analyze, and advocate for policy solutions to homelessness.

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:32.360
This organization provides capacity building assistance to help communities turn policy solutions and proven best practices,

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.040
into viable, on-the-ground programs.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:44.540
They provide communities across the countries with the best practices, how-to-do kits, and technical assistance training to help them impliment solutions

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:47.300
develop through policy research and practice.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:52.780
If you go to their site or their YouTube channel, you can not only see all the people that are helped out through this,

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:58.340
but you can see all the various ways and strategies that they're using to stop homelessness.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.300
To make it so that it's not a problem anymore.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:10.580
This is a serious issue that faces so many individuals and families and you can help them get back on their feet, and live the life that they deserve.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.800
Definitely check them out and see how you can help.
