00:00:06.881 --> 00:00:10.303
Visiting the bathroom is part 
of the daily human experience.

00:00:10.303 --> 00:00:12.862
But occasionally, constipation strikes,

00:00:12.862 --> 00:00:16.414
a condition that causes 
a backup in your digestive system.

00:00:16.414 --> 00:00:19.911
The food you eat can take several days 
to exit your body.

00:00:19.911 --> 00:00:22.663
And for many, 
constipation can become chronic,

00:00:22.663 --> 00:00:27.322
meaning regularly passing lumpy 
hard stools accompanied by straining.

00:00:27.322 --> 00:00:30.432
What's behind this 
unsettling phenomenon?

00:00:30.432 --> 00:00:35.201
Constipation arises in the colon, 
also known as the large intestine.

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:38.614
This muscular organ is split
into four sections:

00:00:38.614 --> 00:00:39.533
the ascending,

00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:40.363
transverse,

00:00:40.363 --> 00:00:41.245
descending,

00:00:41.245 --> 00:00:43.314
and sigmoid colon,

00:00:43.314 --> 00:00:45.584
which connects with the rectum and anus.

00:00:45.584 --> 00:00:47.614
The small intestine delivers stool

00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:52.083
consisting of ingested food, 
bile, and digestive juices

00:00:52.083 --> 00:00:54.093
to the large intestine.

00:00:54.093 --> 00:00:55.984
As this stool moves through the colon,

00:00:55.984 --> 00:00:59.534
the organ siphons off most 
of the water it contains,

00:00:59.534 --> 00:01:02.705
transforming it from liquid to solid.

00:01:02.705 --> 00:01:04.694
The longer this transmission takes,

00:01:04.694 --> 00:01:10.394
the more reabsorption occurs,
resulting in increasingly solid stool.

00:01:10.394 --> 00:01:12.513
Once it reaches the sigmoid colon,

00:01:12.513 --> 00:01:16.605
a final bout of reabsorption 
occurs before it enters the rectum,

00:01:16.605 --> 00:01:21.585
distending its walls and telling
the internal anal sphincter to relax.

00:01:21.585 --> 00:01:25.115
This is the point where you can usually 
decide whether to physically expel

00:01:25.115 --> 00:01:26.985
or retain the stool.

00:01:26.985 --> 00:01:29.405
That’s regulated by 
the pelvic floor muscles,

00:01:29.405 --> 00:01:31.985
particularly the puborectalis

00:01:31.985 --> 00:01:34.158
and external anal sphincter.

00:01:34.158 --> 00:01:38.386
The puborectalis forms 
a sling-like formation around the rectum

00:01:38.386 --> 00:01:40.483
called the anorectal angle.

00:01:40.483 --> 00:01:44.056
And when you voluntarily relax 
your external anal sphincter,

00:01:44.056 --> 00:01:46.527
the stool is finally expelled.

00:01:46.527 --> 00:01:48.156
When you’re constipated, however,

00:01:48.156 --> 00:01:52.817
a desire to visit the bathroom isn't
enough to coax your body into action.

00:01:52.817 --> 00:01:56.014
Usually there's two factors 
behind this problem:

00:01:56.014 --> 00:01:58.578
the stool’s slow movement 
through the colon

00:01:58.578 --> 00:02:01.148
and/or pelvic floor dysfunction.

00:02:01.148 --> 00:02:05.567
In the first, stool moves excessively 
slowly through the intestines,

00:02:05.567 --> 00:02:10.377
causing over-absorption of liquid, 
which makes the stool dry and hard.

00:02:10.377 --> 00:02:11.878
With pelvic floor dysfunction,

00:02:11.878 --> 00:02:14.798
stool becomes difficult 
to eliminate from the rectum

00:02:14.798 --> 00:02:20.419
because of tightened pelvic floor muscles,
or due to a pelvic organ prolapse,

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:24.098
usually through childbirth or aging.

00:02:24.098 --> 00:02:27.598
Both of these problems 
make the anorectal angle more acute

00:02:27.598 --> 00:02:31.188
and it becomes difficult to expel waste.

00:02:31.188 --> 00:02:33.378
To identify constipation precisely,

00:02:33.378 --> 00:02:37.319
researchers have developed metrics,
such as the Bristol Stool Chart.

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.269
Most people who look at that chart

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.580
will be able to tell they’ve experienced 
constipation before.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.640
When you’re on the toilet, you should
ideally be in a squatting position.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.850
With your buttocks firmly 
on the toilet seat,

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.161
you can elevate your feet on a stool

00:02:51.161 --> 00:02:53.621
and lean forwards with a straight back,

00:02:53.621 --> 00:02:58.150
which straightens the anorectal angle
and eases the passage of waste.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.161
Going a day without a bowel movement 
isn’t necessarily cause for alarm.

00:03:02.161 --> 00:03:05.072
But if you are experiencing 
chronic constipation,

00:03:05.072 --> 00:03:07.573
simple dietary and lifestyle changes,

00:03:07.573 --> 00:03:09.092
like fibrous vegetables,

00:03:09.092 --> 00:03:10.361
regular exercise,

00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:11.622
abdominal massage,

00:03:11.622 --> 00:03:14.152
and 6 to 8 cups of water per day

00:03:14.152 --> 00:03:17.201
may help restore your daily
trip to the toilet.
