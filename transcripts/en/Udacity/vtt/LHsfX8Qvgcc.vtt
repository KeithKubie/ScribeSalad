00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.860
So the answer is the first three are correct. We want to get

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:04.850
started programming, and we'll get started

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.030
programming very soon. The most important

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.930
thing is to learn some computer science concepts, and we'll do that

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.760
as we get started programming as well as along the way. And

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.470
the third goal is to write code to extract a link from

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.820
a web page. That'll be the first thing that we do to

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.750
start building our search engine, and collecting the corpus that we'll need

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.180
for the search engine. The fourth choice is not true. We're not going

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.200
to get to the point where we write code to rank

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.998
webpages this unit. That's something that we'll be covering in unit six.
