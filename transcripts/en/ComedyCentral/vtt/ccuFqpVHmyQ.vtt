00:00:00.967 --> 00:00:02.435
First thing we gotta do
to get the bike parade

00:00:02.468 --> 00:00:04.070
canceled is raise awareness.

00:00:04.103 --> 00:00:05.972
Yeah, we're going to need
poster boards, markers,

00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:07.440
and lots of glitter and glue.

00:00:07.473 --> 00:00:08.808
I can't believe Kenny
bailed on us

00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:10.610
just because he thinks Jeff
Bezos is a bad guy.

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:11.978
Yeah, how can somebody
who gives you

00:00:12.011 --> 00:00:13.713
whatever you want be a bad guy?

00:00:15.848 --> 00:00:17.950
It's locked.

00:00:17.983 --> 00:00:20.186
They're closed.
We're all closed.

00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:22.188
Our coffee shop, everything.

00:00:22.221 --> 00:00:23.656
But we're outraged
about something.

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:24.891
We need glitter and glue.

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:27.126
Yeah, well, when the Amazon
fulfillment center opened,

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:29.162
everything else
went out of business.

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:31.164
I let it happen.

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:33.132
I thought the fulfillment center
would be nothing

00:00:33.165 --> 00:00:37.103
but great for the town.
Instead it's buried us.

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:40.273
But it's Christmas.

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:43.943
It's Christmas and we've
no presents, no decorations.

00:00:44.643 --> 00:00:46.346
There's no one
who can help us.

00:00:48.514 --> 00:00:49.715
Look.

00:00:49.748 --> 00:00:51.851
Ho, ho, ho ho.

00:00:51.884 --> 00:00:54.487
It's Santa.

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:07.267
I heard some people here might
need a little Christmas magic.

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:09.469
We sure do Santa.

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:11.537
It's only a couple of weeks
until Christmas

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.606
and we don't have
any presents.

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:16.075
Well, that's no problem
for the hometown

00:01:16.108 --> 00:01:19.846
of my favorite holiday poo.
Where is Mr. Hankey?

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:26.386
Where is that old bundle
of Christmas cheer?

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.691
We ... we had to get rid
of Mr. Hankey.

00:01:32.658 --> 00:01:34.494
Got rid of him.

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:36.562
Mr. Hankey did something bad

00:01:36.595 --> 00:01:40.800
and we were forced
to make him leave, forever.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.238
Jesus, what did he do
[inaudible 00:01:42] a kid?

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:48.842
No, he ... he tweeted
some inappropriate things.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.314
He tweeted some
inappropriate things.

00:01:57.216 --> 00:01:59.018
Oh, you bunch of
[inaudible 00:01:59].

00:01:59.051 --> 00:02:00.586
I'm getting back
in my sleigh now.

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.589
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
Please.

00:02:03.522 --> 00:02:04.790
Merry Christmas.

00:02:04.823 --> 00:02:08.261
Have fun sucking Jeff
Bezos dick you bunch of cunts.

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:14.534
I'm going down to South Park
gonna have my self a time.

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:15.668
Friendly ...
