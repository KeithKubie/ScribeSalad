important thing you can do now is to
 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.470
important thing you can do now is to
reduce your your greenhouse gas

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480
reduce your your greenhouse gas

as far as transport is concerned I try

as far as transport is concerned I try
 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.579

not greenhouse gas intensive and
consuming less rather than more I think

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170
consuming less rather than more I think
 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.800
consuming less rather than more I think
of a major things today

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810
 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.230
I don't see the amount that I give which

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240
I don't see the amount that I give which
 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.350
I don't see the amount that I give which
is currently around a third of what I

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360
is currently around a third of what I
 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.679
is currently around a third of what I
earn I don't see that as a sort of

particular point to to stay with what's
 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.210
particular point to to stay with what's
happened is that I've been giving money

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220
happened is that I've been giving money
 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.160

to organizations like Oxfam for the last

to organizations like Oxfam for the last

to organizations like Oxfam for the last
35 years and we started off with 10%

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439
35 years and we started off with 10%
 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:52.649
35 years and we started off with 10%
with the traditional tithe and we've

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659
with the traditional tithe and we've
 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.210
with the traditional tithe and we've
gradually worked up from there as our

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220
gradually worked up from there as our
 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.190
gradually worked up from there as our
income has grown and as a needs if

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200
income has grown and as a needs if
 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.199
income has grown and as a needs if
anything are less now that we don't have

00:02:01.199 --> 00:02:01.209
anything are less now that we don't have
 

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:03.630
anything are less now that we don't have
children living with us and dependent on

children living with us and dependent on
 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.330
children living with us and dependent on
so it's become easier to give more but I

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340
so it's become easier to give more but I
 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.969
so it's become easier to give more but I
don't recommend that level to everyone I

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979
don't recommend that level to everyone I
 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.590
don't recommend that level to everyone I
think people should start where they

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600
think people should start where they
 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.350
think people should start where they
comfortable with and if things go well

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360
comfortable with and if things go well
 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.920
comfortable with and if things go well
then they can work up to it but I

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930
then they can work up to it but I
 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.750
then they can work up to it but I
suggest in in my book the life you can

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760
suggest in in my book the life you can
 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.570
suggest in in my book the life you can
save I suggest a scale that begins at 1%

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580
save I suggest a scale that begins at 1%
 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.930
save I suggest a scale that begins at 1%
for and remains a 1% for 90 percent of

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940
for and remains a 1% for 90 percent of
 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.850
for and remains a 1% for 90 percent of
American taxpayers until they get into

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860
American taxpayers until they get into
 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.530
American taxpayers until they get into
the top 10 percent of American taxpayers

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540
the top 10 percent of American taxpayers
 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.250
the top 10 percent of American taxpayers
I think 1 percent is adequate you might

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260
I think 1 percent is adequate you might
 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.509
I think 1 percent is adequate you might
want to give more of course but I think

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519
want to give more of course but I think
 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.060
want to give more of course but I think
it's it's enough to say that people

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070
it's it's enough to say that people
 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.259
it's it's enough to say that people
shouldn't point the finger at you and

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269
shouldn't point the finger at you and
 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.280
shouldn't point the finger at you and
blame you for not doing your part

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290
 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.390
I think I think reactions are changing

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400
I think I think reactions are changing
 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.709
I think I think reactions are changing
too to that idea yeah I think we're

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:49.719
too to that idea yeah I think we're
 

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:51.300
too to that idea yeah I think we're
going you know the different countries

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310
going you know the different countries
 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.920
going you know the different countries
are in different stages of thinking

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930
are in different stages of thinking
 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.630
are in different stages of thinking
about ethics it often hangs together

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640
about ethics it often hangs together
 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.839
about ethics it often hangs together
with how religious they are and what

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849
with how religious they are and what
 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.319
with how religious they are and what
sort of view of human life they have in

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329
sort of view of human life they have in
 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.619
sort of view of human life they have in
for that reason but I think a lot of

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:04.629
for that reason but I think a lot of
 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:07.490
for that reason but I think a lot of
places people are starting to think

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500
places people are starting to think
 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.800
places people are starting to think
about the idea of what is what is the

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810
about the idea of what is what is the
 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.229
about the idea of what is what is the
significance of species membership and

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239
significance of species membership and
 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.869
significance of species membership and
to see that as not really the crucial

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:15.879
to see that as not really the crucial
 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.260
to see that as not really the crucial
thing

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270
 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.030
Americans are not actually abysmal at

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040
Americans are not actually abysmal at
 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.530
Americans are not actually abysmal at
giving their money away in general

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540
giving their money away in general
 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.450
giving their money away in general
they're quite good by comparison with

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:24.460
they're quite good by comparison with
 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.070
they're quite good by comparison with
other nations because we have small

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080
other nations because we have small
 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.080
other nations because we have small
government and somewhat lower taxes then

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090
government and somewhat lower taxes then
 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.080
government and somewhat lower taxes then
so the Scandinavian nations and we tend

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090
so the Scandinavian nations and we tend
 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.780
so the Scandinavian nations and we tend
to have larger private philanthropy but

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790
to have larger private philanthropy but
 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.750
to have larger private philanthropy but
the problem is that it often goes to our

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760
the problem is that it often goes to our
 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.800
the problem is that it often goes to our
own community in some way so we give to

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810
own community in some way so we give to
 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.920
own community in some way so we give to
our own religious institution and and

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930
our own religious institution and and
 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.960
our own religious institution and and
most of it doesn't leave that religious

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970
most of it doesn't leave that religious
 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.150
most of it doesn't leave that religious
institution or we give to our own

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160
institution or we give to our own
 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.870
institution or we give to our own
college or school what I think we're

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880
college or school what I think we're
 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.390
college or school what I think we're
really bad at is giving to the world's

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400
really bad at is giving to the world's
 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.270
really bad at is giving to the world's
poorest the people who are not in this

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280
poorest the people who are not in this
 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.240
poorest the people who are not in this
country but who are desperately poor and

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250
country but who are desperately poor and
 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.300
country but who are desperately poor and
that's where most other nations do

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310
that's where most other nations do
 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.680
that's where most other nations do
substantially better than us

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690
 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.790
I think that it's a couple of things one

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800
I think that it's a couple of things one
 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.130
I think that it's a couple of things one
is that it's the individualistic ethos

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140
is that it's the individualistic ethos
 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.370
is that it's the individualistic ethos
it's also a fair level of in front of it

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380
it's also a fair level of in front of it
 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.190
it's also a fair level of in front of it
so it's also a fair level of ignorance

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200
so it's also a fair level of ignorance
 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.070
so it's also a fair level of ignorance
about the world outside the United
