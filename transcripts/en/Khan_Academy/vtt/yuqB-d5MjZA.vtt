00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:01.694
- [Instructor] In the
last video I introduced

00:00:01.694 --> 00:00:03.860
a constrained optimization problem

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.841
where we were trying to
maximize this function,

00:00:05.841 --> 00:00:08.318
f of x, y equals x squared times y,

00:00:08.318 --> 00:00:11.225
but subject to a constraint
that your values of x and y

00:00:11.225 --> 00:00:15.251
have to satisfy x squared
plus y squared equals one.

00:00:15.251 --> 00:00:17.053
And the way we were visualizing this

00:00:17.053 --> 00:00:20.108
was to look at the x, y
plane where this circle here

00:00:20.108 --> 00:00:21.530
represents our constraint.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.195
All of the points that make up this set,

00:00:23.195 --> 00:00:24.998
x squared plus y squared equals one,

00:00:24.998 --> 00:00:29.689
and then this curvy line here
is one of the contours of f,

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.334
meaning, we're setting f of
x, y equal to some constant.

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:37.588
And then I was varying
around that constant c.

00:00:37.588 --> 00:00:40.059
So for high values of c,
the contour would look

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:41.743
something like this,
this is where the value

00:00:41.743 --> 00:00:44.011
of x squared times y is big.

00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:46.412
And then for small values of c,

00:00:46.412 --> 00:00:48.002
the contours would look like this.

00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:50.460
So all the points on this
line would be f of x, y

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.434
equals like 0.01 in this
case, something like that.

00:00:54.434 --> 00:00:57.185
Then the way to think about
maximizing this function

00:00:57.185 --> 00:00:59.292
is to try to increase that value of c

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:02.965
as much as you can without
it falling off the circle.

00:01:02.965 --> 00:01:04.663
And the key observation is

00:01:04.663 --> 00:01:06.391
that happens when they're tangent.

00:01:06.391 --> 00:01:08.079
So, you know, you might
kind of draw this out

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:09.797
in a little sketch and
say there's some curve

00:01:09.797 --> 00:01:11.539
representing your constraint,
which in this case

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:13.727
would be, you know, where our circle is.

00:01:13.727 --> 00:01:15.752
And then the curve
representing the contour

00:01:15.752 --> 00:01:17.856
would just kiss that curve,

00:01:17.856 --> 00:01:20.888
just barely touch it in some way.

00:01:20.888 --> 00:01:23.540
Now, that's pretty, but in
terms of solving the problem,

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.040
we still have some work to do.

00:01:26.898 --> 00:01:29.543
And the main tool we're gonna
use here is the gradient.

00:01:29.543 --> 00:01:31.702
So let me go ahead and draw
a lot more contour lines

00:01:31.702 --> 00:01:34.222
than there already are
for x squared times y.

00:01:34.222 --> 00:01:35.649
So this is many of the contour lines,

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:39.816
and I'll draw the gradient
field, the gradient field of f.

00:01:42.101 --> 00:01:43.507
So I've made a video
about the relationship

00:01:43.507 --> 00:01:45.774
between the gradient and contour lines.

00:01:45.774 --> 00:01:48.566
And the upshot of it is
that these gradient vectors,

00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:50.645
every time they pass
through a contour line,

00:01:50.645 --> 00:01:52.799
they're perpendicular to it.

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:53.860
And the basic reason for that

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.826
is if you walk along the contour line,

00:01:55.826 --> 00:01:57.488
the function isn't changing value,

00:01:57.488 --> 00:01:59.392
so if you want it to change most rapidly,

00:01:59.392 --> 00:02:01.044
you know, it kind of makes
sense you should walk

00:02:01.044 --> 00:02:02.936
in the perpendicular direction,

00:02:02.936 --> 00:02:05.270
so that no component of
the walk that you're taking

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.770
is, you know, useless, is along the line

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.972
where the function doesn't change.

00:02:09.972 --> 00:02:11.431
But again, there's a whole video on that

00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:15.579
that's worthy checking out
if this feels unfamiliar.

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:17.268
For our purposes, what it means is that

00:02:17.268 --> 00:02:19.691
when we're considering
this point of tangency,

00:02:19.691 --> 00:02:24.434
the gradient of f at that
point is gonna be some vector

00:02:24.434 --> 00:02:27.398
perpendicular to both
the curves at that point.

00:02:27.398 --> 00:02:30.298
So that little vector
represents the gradient of f

00:02:30.298 --> 00:02:33.329
at this point on the plane.

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:34.512
And we can do something very similar

00:02:34.512 --> 00:02:36.361
to understand the other curve.

00:02:36.361 --> 00:02:37.939
Right now I've just
written it as a constraint,

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:39.758
x squared plus y squared equals one.

00:02:39.758 --> 00:02:41.625
But you know, to give
that function a name,

00:02:41.625 --> 00:02:44.875
let's say we've defined g of x, y to be

00:02:46.921 --> 00:02:48.859
x squared plus y squared,

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:50.463
x squared plus y squared.

00:02:50.463 --> 00:02:52.979
In that case, this
constraint is pretty much

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:56.198
just one of the contour
lines for the function g,

00:02:56.198 --> 00:02:57.289
and we can take a look at that.

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:58.867
If we go over here and we look at

00:02:58.867 --> 00:03:02.165
all of the other contour
lines for this function g,

00:03:02.165 --> 00:03:03.614
and it should make sense
that they're circles,

00:03:03.614 --> 00:03:08.009
because this function is
x squared plus y squared.

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:10.263
And if we took a look
at the gradient of g,

00:03:10.263 --> 00:03:14.180
and we go over and ask
about the gradient of g,

00:03:15.368 --> 00:03:16.847
it has that same property,

00:03:16.847 --> 00:03:18.097
that every gradient vector,

00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:19.797
if it passes through a contour line,

00:03:19.797 --> 00:03:21.688
is perpendicular to it.

00:03:21.688 --> 00:03:23.197
So over on our drawing here,

00:03:23.197 --> 00:03:26.257
the gradient vector of g
would also be perpendicular

00:03:26.257 --> 00:03:27.663
to both these curves.

00:03:27.663 --> 00:03:28.648
And you know, maybe in this case,

00:03:28.648 --> 00:03:31.574
it's not as long as the gradient
of f, or maybe it's longer.

00:03:31.574 --> 00:03:33.563
There's no reason that it
would be the same length,

00:03:33.563 --> 00:03:37.574
but the important fact is
that it's proportional.

00:03:37.574 --> 00:03:39.338
And the way that we're
gonna write this in formulas

00:03:39.338 --> 00:03:42.695
is to say that the
gradient of f evaluated,

00:03:42.695 --> 00:03:45.741
let's see, evaluated at
whatever the maximizing value

00:03:45.741 --> 00:03:48.231
of x and y are, so we should
give that a name probably.

00:03:48.231 --> 00:03:52.139
Maybe x sub m, y sub
m, the specific values

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.433
of x and y that are gonna be at this point

00:03:54.433 --> 00:03:57.615
that maximizes the function
subject to our constraint.

00:03:57.615 --> 00:04:00.443
So that's gonna be related
to the gradient of g,

00:04:00.443 --> 00:04:01.377
it's not gonna be quite equal,

00:04:01.377 --> 00:04:03.006
so I'll leave some room here.

00:04:03.006 --> 00:04:05.041
Related to the gradient of g,

00:04:05.041 --> 00:04:08.124
evaluated at that same point, xm, ym.

00:04:10.972 --> 00:04:13.719
And like I said, they're not
equal, they're proportional.

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:14.715
So we need to have some kind

00:04:14.715 --> 00:04:16.633
of proportionality constant in there.

00:04:16.633 --> 00:04:19.475
You almost always use the variable lambda,

00:04:19.475 --> 00:04:20.775
and this guy has a fancy name,

00:04:20.775 --> 00:04:24.343
it's called a Lagrange multiplier.

00:04:24.343 --> 00:04:26.284
Lagrange, Lagrange was one

00:04:26.284 --> 00:04:29.418
of those famous French mathematicians.

00:04:29.418 --> 00:04:30.976
I always get him confused
with some of the other

00:04:30.976 --> 00:04:34.814
French mathematicians at the
time like Legendre or Laplace,

00:04:34.814 --> 00:04:36.161
there's a whole bunch of things.

00:04:36.161 --> 00:04:40.513
Let's see, multiplier,
distracting myself talking here.

00:04:40.513 --> 00:04:42.129
So Lagrange multiplier.

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:44.589
So there's a number of things
in multivariable calculus

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:47.031
named after Lagrange, and
this is one of the big ones.

00:04:47.031 --> 00:04:50.210
This is a technique that
he kind of developed

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.262
or at the very least popularized.

00:04:52.262 --> 00:04:53.917
And the core idea is to just set

00:04:53.917 --> 00:04:55.721
these gradients equal to each other,

00:04:55.721 --> 00:04:57.860
'cause that represents
when the contour line

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.834
for one function is tangent to
the contour line of another.

00:05:02.834 --> 00:05:05.972
So this, this is something
that we can actually work with.

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:07.968
And let's start working it out, right,

00:05:07.968 --> 00:05:10.280
let's see what this
translates to in formulas.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.332
So I already have g written here,

00:05:11.332 --> 00:05:12.776
so let's go ahead and just evaluate

00:05:12.776 --> 00:05:15.526
what the gradient of g should be.

00:05:16.817 --> 00:05:21.184
And that's the gradient of
x squared plus y squared.

00:05:21.184 --> 00:05:23.161
And the way that we take our gradient is

00:05:23.161 --> 00:05:24.913
it's gonna be a vector

00:05:24.913 --> 00:05:26.850
whose components are
all partial derivatives.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.361
So the first component
is the partial derivative

00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:29.840
with respect to x.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.701
So we treat x as a variable,
y looks like a constant.

00:05:32.701 --> 00:05:34.325
The derivative is two x.

00:05:34.325 --> 00:05:36.108
The second component
the partial derivative

00:05:36.108 --> 00:05:38.990
with respect to y, so now we're
treating y as the variable,

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.157
x is the constant, so the
derivative looks like two y.

00:05:44.124 --> 00:05:46.674
So that's the gradient of g.

00:05:46.674 --> 00:05:50.590
Then the gradient of f, gradient of f.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.427
It's gonna look like gradient of,

00:05:53.427 --> 00:05:54.438
let's see, what is x?

00:05:54.438 --> 00:05:55.271
What is f?

00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:57.142
It's x squared times y.

00:05:57.142 --> 00:05:59.142
So x squared times y.

00:06:00.486 --> 00:06:02.131
We do the same thing.

00:06:02.131 --> 00:06:04.604
First component partial
derivative with respect to x,

00:06:04.604 --> 00:06:07.751
x looks like a variable, so
it's derivative is two times x

00:06:07.751 --> 00:06:10.932
and then that y looks like a
constant when we're up here.

00:06:10.932 --> 00:06:13.647
But then partial derivative
with respect to y,

00:06:13.647 --> 00:06:15.928
that y looks like a variable,
that x squared just looks

00:06:15.928 --> 00:06:18.873
like a constant sitting in front of it.

00:06:18.873 --> 00:06:20.277
So that's what we get.

00:06:20.277 --> 00:06:22.307
And now if we kind of work out

00:06:22.307 --> 00:06:24.646
this Lagrange mulitplier expression

00:06:24.646 --> 00:06:29.016
using these two vectors,
what we have written,

00:06:29.016 --> 00:06:32.364
what we're gonna have
written is that this vector,

00:06:32.364 --> 00:06:33.947
two xy x squared

00:06:36.883 --> 00:06:41.050
is proportional with the
proportionality constant lambda to

00:06:43.414 --> 00:06:45.199
the gradient vector for g.

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:46.699
So two x two y.

00:06:48.673 --> 00:06:49.772
And if you want you can think about this

00:06:49.772 --> 00:06:51.311
as two separate equations.

00:06:51.311 --> 00:06:53.204
I mean right now it's one
equation with vectors,

00:06:53.204 --> 00:06:55.791
but really what this is saying is

00:06:55.791 --> 00:06:57.572
you've got two separate equations,

00:06:57.572 --> 00:07:01.001
two times xy is equal to lambda,

00:07:01.001 --> 00:07:03.049
ah, gotta change colors a lot here.

00:07:03.049 --> 00:07:05.397
Lambda times two x.

00:07:05.397 --> 00:07:08.110
Hm, gonna be stickler for color.

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:11.787
Keep red all of the
things associated with g.

00:07:11.787 --> 00:07:12.620
And then,

00:07:13.457 --> 00:07:15.728
this second equation is that x squared

00:07:15.728 --> 00:07:18.311
is equal to lambda times two y.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.906
And this might seem like a problem,

00:07:22.906 --> 00:07:25.177
because we have three unknowns, x, y,

00:07:25.177 --> 00:07:26.911
and this new lambda that we introduced.

00:07:26.911 --> 00:07:27.966
Kind of shot ourselves in the foot

00:07:27.966 --> 00:07:30.325
by giving ourselves a new
variable to deal with.

00:07:30.325 --> 00:07:32.124
But we only have two equations.

00:07:32.124 --> 00:07:35.426
So in order to solve this, we're
gonna need three equations.

00:07:35.426 --> 00:07:36.909
And the third equation is something

00:07:36.909 --> 00:07:38.175
that we've known the whole time.

00:07:38.175 --> 00:07:40.104
It's been part of the original problem.

00:07:40.104 --> 00:07:41.507
It's the constraint itself,

00:07:41.507 --> 00:07:44.507
x squared plus y squared equals one.

00:07:46.138 --> 00:07:48.012
So that, that third equation,

00:07:48.012 --> 00:07:51.921
x squared plus y squared is equal to one.

00:07:51.921 --> 00:07:54.857
So these are the three equations

00:07:54.857 --> 00:07:57.604
that characterize our
constrained optimization problem.

00:07:57.604 --> 00:07:59.079
The bottom one just tells you

00:07:59.079 --> 00:08:02.023
that we have to be on
this unit circle here.

00:08:02.023 --> 00:08:03.558
Allow me to just highlight it.

00:08:03.558 --> 00:08:05.477
We have to be on this unit circle.

00:08:05.477 --> 00:08:08.313
And then these top two
tell us what's necessary

00:08:08.313 --> 00:08:10.025
in order for our contour lines,

00:08:10.025 --> 00:08:12.077
the contour of f and the contour of g

00:08:12.077 --> 00:08:15.133
to be perfectly tangent with each other.

00:08:15.133 --> 00:08:18.391
So, in the next video, I'll
go ahead and solve this.

00:08:18.391 --> 00:08:20.800
At this point, it's pretty
much just algebra to deal with,

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.367
but it's worthy going through.

00:08:22.367 --> 00:08:23.783
And then in the next couple ones,

00:08:23.783 --> 00:08:25.444
I'll talk about a way
that you can encapsulate

00:08:25.444 --> 00:08:28.311
all three of these equations
into one expression,

00:08:28.311 --> 00:08:30.357
and also a little bit
about the interpretation

00:08:30.357 --> 00:08:31.901
of this lambda that we introduced.

00:08:31.901 --> 00:08:33.480
'Cause it's not actually
just a dummy variable,

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.966
it has a pretty interesting
meaning in physical contexts

00:08:36.966 --> 00:08:38.368
once you're actually dealing

00:08:38.368 --> 00:08:41.260
with a constrained optimization
problem in practice.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.097
So I'll see you in the next video.
