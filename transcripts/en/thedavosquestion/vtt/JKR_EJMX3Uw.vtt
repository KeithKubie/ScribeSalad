&gt;&gt; Whitney Burton.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.230
&gt;&gt; Hi.
I'm Juan.

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:03.820
&gt;&gt; I'm from the United States.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:04.820
&gt;&gt; And I'm from Argentina.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.299
&gt;&gt; And we would like to say in 2008 we think
there needs to be more

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:13.299
of a concentration on education especially
for children in developing

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:15.019
countries who aren't given that opportunity.

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.750
&gt;&gt; We must not only invest in education but
at the same time in

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.990
sustainable economic development in these
countries by boosting

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.170
agriculture but by creating awareness of their
value of education in

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.400
their future but at the same time create -- strengthening
the

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.550
institutions and creating employment for the
people not to leave a

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.829
country afterwards and have their grades who
are no longer a grade

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:41.090
problem that is grades.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.880
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
A lot of times they will become educated and

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.020
because there's not the
economic stability or the economic institutions

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.680
or infrastructures in
the country, there's no place for them really

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.290
to go and so if you
create economic incentives and economic programs

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.720
that people can then
go and use then they won't have to leave.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.270
They can stay in their country and they can
continue to make their

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.149
country a better place and irradicate poverty
essentially in their

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:07.459
area.

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:11.780
&gt;&gt; The main problem with training is that
people from the developing

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.859
country go to another developed countries
and all the innovations, all

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:19.259
the good ideas that they have implemented
in the developed world and

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.979
developed country, not producing enough management
and not producing

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.969
enough development in their own country and
that's why one of the key

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:30.950
questions in addressing the poverty issues
in this country is not only

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.020
investing in education but strengthening in
the institutions, the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.560
infrastructure -- building infrastructure,
and also at the same time,

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.779
as we have said before, by creation of employment
for the people not

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:51.139
to leave the country and could have a good
work in their own country.

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:54.250
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
Now, every year in North America we spend

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.639
$20 billion on ice cream.
It would only cost $10 billion to build enough

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:00.610
schools for all the
world's children in school.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.079
So think about that the next time you buy
ice cream.

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.950
Think about the little actions you can do
that can really change the

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.810
world 'cause there's a lot we can do through
charities, through NGOs,

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.830
through UN, through so many organizations.
You can change the world every day on a daily

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.140
basis by simply deciding
not to eat ice cream one day and donating

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.810
the money to build a school
or to loan out for someone to start a company

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.640
or a business.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.520
&gt;&gt; The main we must not only rely on the government
to

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.280
solve all or problems but we must be an integral
part of solving that

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.740
problem.
It's only through the advance of the individuals

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.490
of the governments
that we can tackle the major world problem

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.110
such as poverty, and lack
of education, global warming.

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.980
We should act as a community respecting each
and other's favors.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.260
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much and have a great day.
Bye.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.420
&gt;&gt; Bye.
We challenge you, Davos.
