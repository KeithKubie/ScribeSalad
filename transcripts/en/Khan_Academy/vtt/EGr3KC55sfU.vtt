00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.742
Let's see if we can write
0.0727 as a fraction.

00:00:06.742 --> 00:00:08.950
Now, let's just think about
what places these are in.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.130
This is in the tenths place.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.510
This is in the hundredths place.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.700
This 2 is in the
thousandths place.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.640
And this 7 right
here, this last 7,

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.889
is in the ten-thousandths place.

00:00:27.889 --> 00:00:29.680
So there's a couple of
ways we can do this.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.846
The way I like to think of
this, this term over here

00:00:31.846 --> 00:00:33.390
is in the ten-thousandths place.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.275
We can view this whole
thing right over here

00:00:35.275 --> 00:00:41.960
as 727 ten-thousandths because
this is the smallest place

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.950
right over here.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.120
So let's just rewrite it.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:53.330
This is equal to
727 over 10,000.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.280
And we've already
written it as a fraction.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.840
And I think that's about as
simplified as we can get.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.590
This number up here
is not divisible by 2.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.660
It's not divisible by 5.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.200
In fact, it's not
divisible by 3,

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.300
which means it wouldn't
be divisible by 6 or 9.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.060
It doesn't even seem
to be divisible by 7.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.750
It might be a prime number.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.199
But I think we are done.
