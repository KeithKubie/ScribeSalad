00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.000
My 3 year old got into the paints again, but
this time he made a picture that impressed

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.389
me so much, I wanted to get it framed and
hang it somewhere special. Until I realized

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:13.049
that custom frames are ridiculously expensive.
So in this project let's find a way to use

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.400
this plain old wooden board, to make an ostentatious
picture frame, that will keep costs low, but

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.420
hopefully instill a sense of accomplishment,
that's priceless.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.240
Let's 
start this project with a 6' length of common
board I got at the hardware store for under

00:00:34.249 --> 00:00:38.829
$4.00. Now, it's important the board is completely
straight, and you can check for any warping

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.199
by peering straight down the top. I'll also
try bordering the picture with a pre-cut matting

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:46.929
I got from the hobby store, because the inner
edges are beveled, which should help give

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:51.129
the picture nicer finish. Now the first thing
we need to do is cut a small piece off the

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.269
end of the board to make sure the edge is
straight and clean. Next, let's cut two pieces

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.120
to custom heights, and by ripping the two
boards at the same time, you can see they

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.999
end up exactly the same size. The other 2
pieces are cut using the same method, but

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:07.430
you can see they're quite a bit longer, and
that's because the frame is pretty thick and

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.410
these are gonna form the top and bottom.
Ok, we need a way to fasten this together,

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.440
and I'm gonna try using a mini pocket hole
jig. This is simply clamped to the end of

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.220
the board and allows us to cut a diagonal
hole at about a 15ยบ angle. You could try

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.320
drilling without the jig, but this way it
ends up looking a little more professional.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.480
Now if we add a bit of wood glue to the sides
that touch, press them firmly together, then

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.660
drive a screw into the holes we made, it'll
fasten the boards together cleanly, and very

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.860
securely. Now just for fun, let's head to
the router station and try using a key-hole

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.920
bit to make a slot for hanging the frame on
the wall. If you wanna see how I made this

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.380
router table, see if you can find it in a
previous project. Now I'm gonna try clamping

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.120
down a straight-edge and marking where the
center of the bit lines up. And if we mark

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.560
a 2" section across the middle of the frame,
you can see now, that when the router is spinning,

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.600
we're able to slowly press the board down
flat on the table, and carefully follow the

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.170
markings to cut out a recessed groove on the
backside. I chose to lift it straight up to

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.400
finish the cut, and hopefully from this angle
you can see what it did. The head of a screw

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.060
can enter, but then it's held securely on
the inside of the groove. Ok, let's try swapping

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.410
out the key-hole bit for a 1/2" rabbeting
bit. If we follow the inside ridge of the

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.840
frame, you can see it cuts a 1/2" channel
where we can fit the picture and glass later

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.640
on. While we're here, let's try cutting a
groove around the outer edge as well. And

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.590
this is just to make them pop out a little
more. Alright, the edges are looking good,

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.980
but still a little rough with splinters, but
you can see a little sanding will clean it

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.569
up quickly and easily. Now instead of using
real glass to protect the picture, I'm gonna

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.970
try plexiglas instead. You might remember
in a previous project, I took the screen off

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.690
an old TV, and used one of the layers to create
a giant solar scorcher, which was used for

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.790
all sorts of projects. But there were still
two other layers to the screen, one of which

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.610
was a clear sheet of plexiglass. Now I tried
using a belt sander to round the edges so

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.520
it would fit the frame, and now we can use
it as a template on the picture frame matting,

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.430
to trace the edges, and cut it to fit. If
we tape the picture to the back, and take

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.750
a look, you can see the beveled inner edges
are already starting to make the picture pop.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.069
Alright, it's time to finish the frame. I
have this can of Onyx black paint from a previous

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.180
project, and I decided to go ahead and just
brush one thick coating, making sure to cover

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.700
the sides as well. Now we can leave this to
dry for a couple of hours, and when we come

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.270
back, the frame is actually looking pretty
good. We could stop here, but I want to use

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.800
a bit of sandpaper to rough up the edges and
give it a bit of a distressed look. This way,

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.640
when it gets beaten up over time, it'll
still look just as good. Alright, the frame

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.610
is finished, so now we can insert the plexiglas,
the picture, and a wooden backing to keep

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.020
it together and press it all flat. To secure
the blacking in place, I'm gonna try shooting

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.130
some brad nails at a bit of an angle into
each of the 4 corners, then pressing them

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.099
down flat as well. At this point, our picture
frame is completely finished. My little boy

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.779
gave his approval, and we decided to hang
it on one of the prominent walls of the play

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.680
room, the same place where it hangs to this
day. Now, these frames are so simple and easy

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.569
to make, and have such a modern and elegant
feel to them, that I went ahead and made a

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.819
whole bunch more and framed some of the other
pictures in our house. So sure, you need a

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.920
few tools to make them, but I got most of
mine second hand at garage sales, and the

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.590
savings on just a couple of these homemade
frames, more than made up the difference.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.720
Well now you know how to turn a simple piece
of common board, into modern and decorative

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.250
picture frames, that are super low cost to
build, make your favorite pictures stand out

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.570
in style, and show the people that painted
them that their work is appreciated. Well

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.460
that's it for now, if you liked this project
perhaps you'll like some of my others. Check
