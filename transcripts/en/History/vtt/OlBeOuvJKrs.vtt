[suspenseful music]

00:00:03.044 --> 00:00:07.090
NARRATOR: In 1859,
biologist Charles Darwin

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:08.800
introduced the
world to the theory

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.096
of evolution with his book
on "The Origin of Species."

00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:17.684
In it, he proposed that gradual,
multi-generational changes,

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:20.103
occurring due to
natural selection,

00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:25.275
had resulted in the modification
of all existing species.

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:29.237
While scientists agree that
this process does, in fact,

00:00:29.237 --> 00:00:32.699
take place to some
extent, in recent years,

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:36.494
evidence has been presented
that suggests evolution alone

00:00:36.494 --> 00:00:38.538
cannot account for
all the species

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:41.458
present in the animal kingdom.

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:43.752
There is one species of dog.

00:00:43.752 --> 00:00:46.671
But look at it, from
chihuahuas to St. Bernards,

00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:49.549
to bulldogs,
everything in between.

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:52.927
And all that has happened in
less than a few thousand years.

00:00:52.927 --> 00:00:54.637
I mean, this is crazy.

00:00:54.637 --> 00:00:57.891
This is like going from this
generalized wolf-like creature

00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:01.811
into this huge variety of dogs.

00:01:01.811 --> 00:01:06.065
There are fossils of
giraffes with short necks.

00:01:06.065 --> 00:01:08.735
And then we have the present.

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:11.946
And there is no
intermediate form.

00:01:11.946 --> 00:01:14.032
If you suddenly give
a giraffe a much

00:01:14.032 --> 00:01:19.704
longer neck than it had before,
a lot of things have to change.

00:01:19.704 --> 00:01:22.957
Its blood pressure
regulation has to change.

00:01:22.957 --> 00:01:24.667
It's got to have
a different heart.

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:27.420
It's just going to be
eating different things

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.088
with a long neck.

00:01:29.088 --> 00:01:32.467
All of that software for the
animal has to be rewritten.

00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:38.431
And you're telling me this
all happens overnight?

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:42.018
NARRATOR: Ancient astronaut
theorists propose that if some,

00:01:42.018 --> 00:01:45.438
or possibly, all of the
lifeforms on Earth cannot be

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:50.360
explained as the product of
natural selection or evolution,

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.865
it may, in fact, offer proof
of not only intelligent design,

00:01:55.865 --> 00:02:01.204
but also what they believe to be
extraterrestrial intervention.

00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:03.248
And they say the
overwhelming evidence

00:02:03.248 --> 00:02:07.418
can be found by examining the
practices of ancient cultures

00:02:07.418 --> 00:02:08.461
all over the world.

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:09.462
