[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.910
MALE SPEAKER 1: All right,
again, thank you for coming.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.350
We have a guest
speaker today, Victor,

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.520
to talk about going
screenless with YouTube.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.880
I met Victor a few years ago.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.620
We were co-workers, and
it was the first time

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.470
I had the opportunity
to learn how

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.160
to use the web through
screen readers.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.930
Back then, I had no
idea that was possible,

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.640
and not only that, but I learned
from the engineering side

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.850
that you can do simple stuff
to make the whole web more

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.480
accessible to everyone.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.030
Please help me welcome Victor
Tsaran from eBay, Paypal.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.415
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:14.415 --> 00:04:15.165
VICTOR TSARAN: OK.

00:04:15.165 --> 00:04:15.850
Hey, guys.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.190
Can you hear me well?

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.690
Cool.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.089
OK, start over.

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:22.270
[INAUDIBLE]

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.120
OK, sorry.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.700
OK, good.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.450
I always need to hold
something in my hand

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.630
because otherwise-- It better
be hot and with caffeine.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.200
Anyway, so thank you for coming.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.880
This is great.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.530
I hope we're going to learn
today something about YouTube

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:43.850
and a new user experience
probably for most of you,

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.730
and that is how you use
YouTube if you can't see.

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.120
So what I want to
start is by telling you

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.067
just a little bit about
myself because I'm

00:04:54.067 --> 00:04:55.650
hoping that through
my personal story,

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.780
you will see why we really need
to worry about these things,

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.310
making things
accessible, and why

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.910
we need to worry, especially
about YouTube, making

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.440
available to everybody.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.050
So I was born in Ukraine and
went through all the same stuff

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.020
like most of you, high
schools and things like that,

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.420
and then, when I entered
university, my real, sort of,

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.490
touch with the
world began, where

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.420
at the university,
as you know, you

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:22.680
need to deal with homeworks.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.400
You need to deal with
a lot of teachers,

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.470
and you need to deal with
all kinds of situations

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:33.120
where you couldn't rely
anymore on your parents

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.150
to come and help you out
whenever you need it,

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.810
so the real life
challenges began.

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.940
How do you read something?

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.040
How do you take notes?

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.900
How do you take books
from the library?

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:50.670
How do you turn in your
homeworks and things like that?

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:54.450
And at that time, there
was really no technology

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.470
to speak of, at
least in Ukraine,

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.910
and so the only thing I could
do is rely on, so to speak,

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.990
human readers.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.490
Right?

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.110
So every time you needed
some help you'd say,

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.960
can you help me out,
and of course, you

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.830
had to learn your
basics in diplomacy.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.240
I call it Diplomacy
101 because you

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.220
got to be careful not to
step on people's toes,

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.237
and everybody's got
their own timeline.

00:06:19.237 --> 00:06:20.820
And they have to
read their own books,

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.656
and they have to meet with their
dates and things like that.

00:06:24.656 --> 00:06:27.234
And, you know, the girlfriend
is waiting and there's like,

00:06:27.234 --> 00:06:29.150
hey, can you read for
me some philosophy book.

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.390
It's like, come on, get away.

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.480
So you do have to
learn how to really

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.830
be considerate of other people's
time, but at the same time,

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.830
while being able to achieve
your own goals, which

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.610
is for me, obviously, was
to complete my studies

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:48.370
and go in and get a job and be
as productive in life as I can.

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:53.540
So two years into my
studies, I got a scholarship

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.130
to come and study in
the United States.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:00.230
It was a student
exchange program

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:04.580
for a year where one of
the things I had to learn

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.335
was computers.

00:07:06.335 --> 00:07:08.100
It was like, wow,
this is so interesting

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.990
because up until that
time, I heard people

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:12.640
playing some games on Atari.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.900
And my computer
science professor

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.020
told me, well, there's not
very much I can do for you.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.560
You know, we could
probably learn

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.800
how to compose music
on the computer which

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.090
at that time as you
some of you may know,

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.040
you had to type in
the notes and it

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.530
was using the PCs
speaker buzzer.

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:36.150
So if you could call
it music, that's

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.370
what it was in those days.

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:42.470
And so at the end, we
just basically decided

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:46.680
there was really no sense for
me to attend in those computer

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.282
classes because
I couldn't really

00:07:48.282 --> 00:07:49.490
benefit from them in any way.

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:53.160
So when I heard that I was
selected to go and study

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.410
in the United States, I was
like, wow, this is so cool.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:59.160
Let's see what happens.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.690
And the very first thing,
because I was a philosophy

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:05.210
major, of course, I was all
crazy about learning history,

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:07.981
and information was
the king for me.

00:08:07.981 --> 00:08:08.480
Right?

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.510
It's like how much can
you remember, analytics,

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:13.930
and all that kind of critical
thinking that sort of stuff.

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:15.550
And so the very
first application

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:18.550
that I found when
using computers,

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:21.470
besides typing and doing
all the basic things,

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:25.650
is going to encyclopedia
and learning anything

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:28.210
I possibly could about
the world around me.

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:30.200
And it was just like,
wow, this is so cool,

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:34.990
not only that I could just
tap into this amazing wealth

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:38.380
of knowledge around me
just by using the keyboard,

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.030
but imagine, I didn't
have to ask anybody.

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:45.035
I just could log in into my
Unix box-- well, at that time,

00:08:45.035 --> 00:08:47.370
it was DOS based,
but I was already

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:51.040
playing a little bit with Unix
and Pine and all the emails,

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.430
you know.

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:54.479
So I don't know how
many of you use Unix,

00:08:54.479 --> 00:08:57.020
but I would imagine that many
of you, since you're engineers,

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:59.180
so we can speak common language.

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.460
You know, going in
terminal and using

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:05.690
IRC all this stuff
was exciting days.

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:08.862
But the most important thing
was this feel of independence.

00:09:08.862 --> 00:09:11.410
You know, suddenly you could
just do things on your own,

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:17.040
and if things we're available
to you in the format, then

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.282
things just became so
much more pleasant to use.

00:09:20.282 --> 00:09:22.240
And you could do it at
5 o'clock in the morning

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.906
if that's what you
wanted to do, and you

00:09:23.906 --> 00:09:26.620
could do it totally
independent of everybody else.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.436
And so that got me interested
in computer science.

00:09:29.436 --> 00:09:32.060
So I went back to Ukraine, and
I established the first computer

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:34.460
center for the blind
where we taught students

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:35.450
how to use computers.

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:41.160
We created the first screen
reader program for blind users

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.720
in Ukraine.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:47.000
And here you hear me mention
the word screen here,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.936
so we're gonna hear and see
more of that as we move on.

00:09:50.936 --> 00:09:52.810
And eventually-- so I
got back to the States.

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:55.120
I completed my computer
science degree.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.430
After that, my wife and I--
actually, I met my wife there

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:02.275
at the exchange
program, so it there

00:10:02.275 --> 00:10:04.990
was another big event for me.

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:09.240
And together, we traveled
in Southeast Asia teaching

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:13.270
computers to kids
in poor provinces,

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:17.950
so that was another
interesting experience,

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:21.170
not only because I could
actually apply my teaching

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:23.220
skills in computers,
but also, it

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.760
made me think about
things like jargon,

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.980
how much we take for granted
here when everybody speaks

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:32.350
English language, when
programmers understand

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:35.510
English language pretty
much since day one.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.039
And now, you go
into another country

00:10:37.039 --> 00:10:38.580
and you say something
like "sign in,"

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:42.010
and people like,
what do you mean?

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:45.500
What should I be doing?

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.630
So this made me think
about a lot of things

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:50.390
like, well, how do we use
language in computers.

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:52.420
What's understandable
for me may not

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:55.482
be understandable for
somebody whose English is not

00:10:55.482 --> 00:10:59.610
at the same level or worse, for
whom computers is just a tool.

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:00.680
They're not programmers.

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:04.910
They're not even curious
by nature, for example.

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:07.650
They just need to be able
to type in their homework

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:10.450
and go get a job, perhaps,
even in the call center,

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:13.060
and computer for them
is just a tool just

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.220
like a hammer for a DIY person.

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.860
So it made me think
about that kind of stuff,

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:21.720
how do we go about translating.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.960
There's also something
about cultural perception

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:24.830
of computers.

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:29.310
For Western cultures, where
technology is a bit more

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:33.030
of a normal thing,
many of us were

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:37.490
born with some kind of
technology, telephones,

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:41.810
television, computers, modems,
and all that kind of stuff.

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:43.980
So we're less scared
of that stuff,

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:48.250
but you go to countries where
people don't even have access

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:51.770
to white canes that blind
people use to walk around,

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:53.500
and suddenly, the
word "computers,"

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.990
not only that it's,
for many, unaffordable,

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:59.000
let's say it's-- We're in
a different time right now

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.660
because many more
things are affordable,

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:04.440
even in developing countries,
but just even getting used

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:10.090
to this idea of interacting with
a soulless piece of hardware,

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:15.030
for many cultures,
is a difficult thing.

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:17.790
So those are the things that
I learned, and with that, I

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:22.450
moved on and got a job in
DC doing some contracts

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:25.690
for the government, so that was
another interesting exercise

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:30.320
in learning how to
procrastinate and not do things.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.860
You could get
really good at that,

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:34.330
especially seeing government
employees around you saying

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:35.913
like, well, you know,
I don't actually

00:12:35.913 --> 00:12:37.870
have to do accessibility
because nobody's

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:40.580
going to fire me anyways,
so why would I bother?

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:44.130
So I had to practice my
Diplomacy 201, at that point,

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:47.220
on how to get people interested
in accessibility, which

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.155
actually worked out
really well because those

00:12:49.155 --> 00:12:51.280
are the same skills-- when
I came to Silicon Valley

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.190
to work at Yahoo and
now, at Paypal, I'm

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.540
using those same skills
because guess what.

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:58.220
People here don't
really care about laws

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:01.640
or legal applications
or whatever it may be,

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:04.440
but people understand
human language and meaning.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.100
When I talk to you guys or
to anybody else as humans

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:10.180
to humans, we can
understand that everybody

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:12.380
wants to make the
world a better place,

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:15.540
and oftentimes, all our
fighting and our battles

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.187
are about how we
go about doing it.

00:13:18.187 --> 00:13:20.270
But as I mentioned before,
one of the big things I

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:22.900
did understand from my travel
and in teaching other people

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:26.440
is that in order to make people
feel a little closer to what

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:29.860
you're talking about, you
need to make them feel

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:31.410
the same feelings
you are feeling,

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:34.290
and especially when it
comes with the computers,

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:36.340
we're basically talking
about user experience.

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:36.840
Right?

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.140
User Experience 101.

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:41.070
And so what I
wanted to do today--

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:42.730
we will touch on the
engineering stuff

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:45.200
as much as you're
willing to go there,

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.820
and probably, this
is an inevitable.

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:50.970
We're gonna talk about
some technical applications

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:53.260
of accessibility, but
first and foremost, I

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:57.570
wanted you to go together
with me through the YouTube

00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:01.190
interface and see,
or rather, hear,

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:03.050
what it feels like
to use YouTube

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:05.890
when you can't see the screen.

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:08.926
Now, before we even
go to YouTube--

00:14:08.926 --> 00:14:13.650
I need to go in here--
I wanted to tell you

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:16.320
a little bit about the software
that actually makes it possible

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:19.215
because remember the
hammer for the DIY person.

00:14:19.215 --> 00:14:19.715
Right?

00:14:19.715 --> 00:14:22.006
You gotta know how to use
the hammer because otherwise,

00:14:22.006 --> 00:14:25.045
you'll be left without fingers,
and so on and so forth.

00:14:25.045 --> 00:14:28.840
Or worse yet, you might
be left without a house

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.660
if you don't know
what you are doing.

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:33.550
So same thing with
the computers-- right?

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:36.570
So I need to have
a tool that enables

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:41.230
me to be able to interact
with this piece of hardware,

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:45.960
and this tool is called a
screen reader, a little bit

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:51.090
an outdated term because
back in the dust days,

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:53.920
this is what this piece
of software used to do.

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.140
It literally would
read this screen,

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:58.360
try to interpret what
was going on the screen,

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:03.090
and then, speak it back to
you in a synthetic speech.

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:05.340
Synthetic speech,
back in those days,

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:07.780
was nothing close to
what you guys will

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:09.580
be hearing in a minute.

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:11.811
Back in those days
it was like aliens,

00:15:11.811 --> 00:15:14.185
kind of like cyberspace, stuff
like, buh-buh-buh-buh-buh,

00:15:14.185 --> 00:15:15.370
you know.

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:16.500
It was really, really hard.

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:19.310
I remember I had
such-- it took me just

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:23.190
two weeks to get used to
the toneless synthesizer,

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:27.320
and it not only was like
one dimensional stream,

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.360
but it also was
totally soulless.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.500
I mean there was no intonation.

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.240
There was no articulation.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.330
They've gotten better at that
because once they figured out,

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:39.730
you know, form an algorithm
and how you can raise speech

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:41.670
and so on and so
forth, they're like,

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:44.250
oh, you know, when there's
a question mark, even

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:46.700
that soulless voice,
we can actually

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.800
make it raise the
pitch a little bit.

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:51.409
But anyway, I digress.

00:15:51.409 --> 00:15:52.950
So back in those
days, screen readers

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:54.130
used to read the screen.

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:59.180
Now, as we entered into the
world of Windows and Windows 95

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:05.490
and then, essentially, APIs,
screen readers no longer really

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:10.570
have to read the screen because
the way our screens look now,

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:12.170
people can't make sense of it.

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:12.670
You know?

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:14.920
Forget about computers
trying to make sense of it.

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.830
So really the most reliable way
to put screen readers right now

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:20.760
to interact with the
computer is through the API.

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:23.120
That starts from
the desktop APIs,

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:30.124
then goes into browser APIs, and
eventually, goes into-- well,

00:16:30.124 --> 00:16:32.290
I wouldn't want to call DOM
API, but for the purpose

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:34.490
of this conversation,
we could call it an API

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:37.790
because it's an application
interface, as far as the web

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:40.490
page and the screen
reader is concerned.

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:43.070
Then, they go into the DOM.

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:47.560
So the reason I'm telling
you all of this is-- so now,

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:51.370
the screen reader, from being
this active tool that sort

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:52.670
of scans the screen and--

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:53.360
COMPUTER: Bye.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.776
VICTOR TSARAN: --tries to
figure out what's on the screen,

00:16:55.776 --> 00:16:58.590
it really becomes more of a
passive tool that sits there

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:01.060
and listens to what the
computer is telling it.

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:06.050
So for example, if I'm-- I
assume many of you here use

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:07.293
Macs right?

00:17:07.293 --> 00:17:08.334
Anybody here use Windows?

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:12.040
Not a hand.

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.240
OK.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.290
So I'll try to keep it
sort of cross platform.

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:18.040
I think a lot of the
concepts are similar,

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.670
but because I'm
using the Mac you're

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:23.430
gonna hear Mac pretty much
throughout this conversation.

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:28.554
So if I'm gonna go to the dock,
I'm gonna hit the shortcut key.

00:17:28.554 --> 00:17:29.360
COMPUTER: Dock.

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.935
Google Chrome open, 22 of 28.

00:17:30.935 --> 00:17:32.560
VICTOR TSARAN: OK,
let me slow it down.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.670
COMPUTER: Default volume
one-- Default pitch, 51%.

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:35.870
Default intonation, 50%.

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:37.040
Default voice, Alex.

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:40.069
Default rate, 51-- 31-- 36%.

00:17:40.069 --> 00:17:42.610
VICTOR TSARAN: OK, I hope this
is a bit easier to understand.

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:44.290
COMPUTER: Google Chrome o--

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:47.770
VICTOR TSARAN: So what you
will notice here-- and in fact,

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:51.740
to give a little bit
better experience for you--

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:53.130
COMPUTER: Screen curtain on.

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:55.130
VICTOR TSARAN: So I'm
gonna turn off the screen.

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:57.080
I hope it did turn off.

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.960
What we're going to
do next is-- this

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.450
is a really important-- sorry.

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:03.450
I forget I need to be
close to the microphone.

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:05.140
--really important
piece of information

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.130
is that when you
use a screen reader,

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:10.480
it's like looking
through a straw.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.790
When you get into the dark
room, and somebody told you,

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:15.550
at the end of the room, there
is something you need to find.

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:19.550
I'm talking the video
game kind of language.

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:21.020
What you're gonna
do is that you're

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:25.030
gonna start learning the
things about your room,

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:27.880
but you're gonna learn them one
by one because you can't see.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:31.480
So you have no concept of
left corner, right corner,

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.981
and so this is how it feels
a little bit using the screen

00:18:33.981 --> 00:18:34.480
reader.

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.725
So at this point, you
guys have seen the dock,

00:18:36.725 --> 00:18:38.470
so it's a little unfair.

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:42.000
But if I ask you what's at
the end of the dock, what's

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.710
the last item on
the dock, I wonder

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:45.127
how many of you could say that.

00:18:45.127 --> 00:18:46.710
And so when you use
the screen reader,

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:49.410
you have to explore
this one by one.

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:51.480
And the screen reader
will only speak the things

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.200
that are currently under
focus, a very important point

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:57.050
because I don't want the
screen reader to be jabbering

00:18:57.050 --> 00:18:59.000
about anything and
everything on the screen.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.830
I just want to be in control.

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:03.130
So let's explore this together.

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:04.880
So I'm gonna be using
left and right arrow

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.910
to go through the dock.

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:10.400
COMPUTER: Skype, 23 of 28.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:14.250
Feedback assistant, 24 of 28.

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:18.150
Feedback assistant, 25 of 28.

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:21.980
Downloads folder, 27 of 28.

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:24.969
Trash, 28 of 28.

00:19:24.969 --> 00:19:26.010
VICTOR TSARAN: Let's go--

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:29.140
COMPUTER: VMware
Fusion, 21 of 28.

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:33.710
Microsoft Lync, 20 of 20--
[INAUDIBLE], 19 of 20.

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:38.465
System preferences, 18
of-- App store, 17 of 28.

00:19:38.465 --> 00:19:40.090
VICTOR TSARAN: OK,
so you got the idea.

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:40.730
Right?

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:43.959
A couple of things that happened
there is that the API started

00:19:43.959 --> 00:19:45.750
giving the screen reader
a couple of pieces

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:47.030
of information.

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:49.900
Number one, they give it a
name-- right? --of what exactly

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:52.690
you're pointing at, obviously
very important-- right?

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:55.340
--because you need to
know what application.

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:57.120
They tell you something
about, probably

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.910
you noticed, 23 of 28,
and so on and so forth.

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:00.410
Right?

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:04.357
So it's giving you the size
of this particular element

00:20:04.357 --> 00:20:06.440
in this particular widget
that's going to be dock.

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:10.742
So I kind of know how big-- Am I
supposed to go through 55 icons

00:20:10.742 --> 00:20:11.950
or is it going to be just 28.

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:13.160
Right?

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:16.420
Little bit of information,
but quite important.

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:19.520
How many of you
were able to hear

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:23.070
if there were any folders there,
and if yes, then how many?

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:28.000
Cool.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:28.870
Yeah, you got it.

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:31.050
So there was a downloads
folder, quite important.

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:31.700
Right?

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:34.370
There's a downloads
folder so the user knows,

00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:36.380
I know, in this
instance, that there

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.710
is a folder as opposed to--

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:39.989
COMPUTER: iBooks, 16 of 28.

00:20:39.989 --> 00:20:41.030
VICTOR TSARAN: All right?

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:42.957
As opposed to just
an icon because I'm

00:20:42.957 --> 00:20:45.165
going to behave differently
based on that information

00:20:45.165 --> 00:20:48.260
that I just received.

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:50.800
And most of you know,
of course, folder

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.940
means that it's
not an app, so I'm

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:56.890
gonna be probably looking for
it to have some files in there

00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:58.020
or whatever it is.

00:20:58.020 --> 00:20:58.520
OK.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:01.840
Before I'm going to
turn on this screen,

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:03.940
let's do one more
little exercise.

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:07.399
The next one I'm gonna do,
I'm gonna open the menu bar--

00:21:07.399 --> 00:21:09.440
and one thing you will
already notice right here,

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:12.080
which I'm sure is obvious,
but I want to point it out.

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.640
I'm not using mouse here
at all, so everything I do

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:17.850
is through keyboard exclusively.

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:21.460
So that means if there's any
piece of this interface that

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:25.270
does not have a shortcut key
or I cannot tap to, it means

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:27.100
it's inaccessible
to me completely.

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:31.220
Well, not exactly, but for the
purpose of this conversation,

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:33.070
it's inaccessible to me.

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:37.436
So what I'm gonna to do is
I'm gonna go to the menu bar.

00:21:37.436 --> 00:21:39.060
So I'm gonna hit the
shortcut key which

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:41.330
is provided by my screen reader.

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:43.397
COMPUTER: Menu bar, Apple.

00:21:43.397 --> 00:21:45.480
VICTOR TSARAN: OK, so I
heard the word "menu bar."

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:50.200
Again, I know which context I am
currently in, super important.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.641
And anything else
you guys heard there?

00:21:53.641 --> 00:21:54.140
Right.

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:57.790
So what is that?

00:21:57.790 --> 00:21:59.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:59.160 --> 00:21:59.860
VICTOR TSARAN: Yeah, you got it.

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:02.070
So it's basically the title
of the particular menu.

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:08.340
Let's see if I can ask my screen
reader how to navigate that.

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:10.535
COMPUTER: This item
has no help tag.

00:22:10.535 --> 00:22:12.140
VICTOR TSARAN: OK,
that's not good.

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:14.894
So I ask it can you
tell me how to navigate.

00:22:14.894 --> 00:22:16.310
I guess they assume
that everybody

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:18.050
knows how to navigate
the menu bar.

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:21.730
Well, I'll be using the left
and right arrow keys, and so--

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:22.860
COMPUTER: Chrome.

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:24.360
VICTOR TSARAN: This
is not the menu.

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:25.690
COMPUTER: File.

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:26.950
Edit.

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:27.860
View.

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:28.900
History.

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:29.870
Bookmarks.

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:30.660
VICTOR TSARAN: OK.

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:32.379
So let me go down in
one of these menus,

00:22:32.379 --> 00:22:34.295
so I'm going to go to,
let's say, Chrome menu.

00:22:34.295 --> 00:22:35.560
COMPUTER: Hit Edit.

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:37.360
Fi-- Chrome.

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.209
Chrome menu, 12 items.

00:22:39.209 --> 00:22:40.250
VICTOR TSARAN: All right.

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:42.870
So there's 12 items in the menu.

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:45.060
And then, I can
just go down arrow.

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.180
COMPUTER: About Google Chrome.

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:50.170
Preferences, Ellipsis,
Command, Comma.

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:50.920
VICTOR TSARAN: OK.

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.680
How much did we
learn from this one?

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:54.560
Anybody?

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:55.689
You?

00:22:55.689 --> 00:22:56.730
Yeah, there's a shortcut.

00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:57.340
You are right.

00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:58.240
Anything else?

00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.630
Let me play to you this again.

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:00.130
OK?

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:02.380
COMPUTER: Preferences,
Ellipsis, Command, Comma.

00:23:06.614 --> 00:23:08.030
VICTOR TSARAN:
Yeah, this is cool.

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:09.571
So what do you see
visually normally?

00:23:09.571 --> 00:23:13.600
I think normally you see--
I think it is ellipses.

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:14.720
Right?

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.530
What does it mean
to you, visually?

00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:17.764
AUDIENCE: There's a dialogue.

00:23:17.764 --> 00:23:19.430
VICTOR TSARAN: Yeah,
there's a dialogue.

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:22.013
Actually, some screen readers
go as far as they will actually,

00:23:22.013 --> 00:23:24.340
instead of ellipsis, they
just simply say, dialogue.

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:26.900
So they would say--

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:29.455
COMPUTER: Preferences,
Ellipsis, Command, Comma.

00:23:29.455 --> 00:23:32.160
VICTOR TSARAN: So they would
say, preference, a dialogue.

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:35.370
A very important context,
again, right here, you see.

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:38.070
So now that I know
that it's ellipsis,

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:40.930
then I know this is gonna
be a dialogue if I open

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:42.400
this particular
menu, and there's

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.690
a shortcut cue, which you
correctly pointed out.

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:49.480
COMPUTER: Signed in as
vtsaran@gmail.com, Ellipsis.

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:50.230
VICTOR TSARAN: OK.

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:52.970
COMPUTER: Clear Browsing Data,
Ellipsis, Command, Shift,

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:54.010
Delete.

00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:57.280
Import Bookmarks and
Settings, Ellipsis.

00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:59.596
Services, Submenu.

00:23:59.596 --> 00:24:01.220
VICTOR TSARAN: OK,
what about this one?

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:05.930
You know it.

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:06.550
Go ahead.

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:15.614
COMPUTER: Hide Google Chrome,
Command, H. Services, Submenu.

00:24:15.614 --> 00:24:16.780
VICTOR TSARAN: Yes, correct.

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:18.270
So it says that
there is a submenu.

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:18.770
Right?

00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:21.353
Obviously, there is a difference
between Ellipsis and Submenu.

00:24:21.353 --> 00:24:23.810
Ellipsis means that the
dialogue is gonna open,

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:26.675
and Submenu is gonna mean
that there is just menu items.

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:33.186
COMPUTER: This item--
Services, Subme--

00:24:33.186 --> 00:24:34.500
VICTOR TSARAN: Cool.

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:38.152
And then, I just use right
arrow keys, and I open the menu.

00:24:38.152 --> 00:24:39.360
COMPUTER: Screen curtain off.

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:40.110
VICTOR TSARAN: OK.

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:41.900
I'm gonna put the
screen back on.

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:44.161
COMPUTER: Closing menu.

00:24:44.161 --> 00:24:45.160
VICTOR TSARAN: OK, cool.

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:47.750
So this is basically
how the navigation

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:49.670
happens on a desktop.

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:53.650
So I'm not using any slides
today, so if you warn me,

00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:56.560
I can take notes, but I'm
sure you guys can take notes.

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.490
There are a couple
of things here

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:00.430
I just want to
summarize for you.

00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:02.140
What the screen
reader needs to be

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.840
successful in letting
the user navigate,

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:07.580
well, number one, the user needs
to be able to get to the item.

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:08.080
Right?

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:11.220
So there's some kind of keyboard
access involved, whether it's

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:15.480
tab, whether it's arrow keys,
depending on the context.

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:19.360
Number two, we need a
title, so everything-- well,

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:21.310
let me actually say,
name, not the title,

00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:23.510
because that's gonna be
a little misleading when

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:24.940
we talk about the web.

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:26.700
So everything needs
a name of sorts,

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:32.870
we call it accessible name,
but that's more of an API talk.

00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:35.630
Then, we need to
know the context.

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:38.190
Right?

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:42.720
We need to know a--
yeah, I guess, a context.

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:43.370
Menu bar.

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:44.860
Is this a menu?

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:47.540
It would also mean, for
example, are we in a check box?

00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:48.510
Is this a button?

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:49.502
And so on and so forth.

00:25:49.502 --> 00:25:51.460
Because knowing that,
the screen reader usually

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:55.310
will be able to figure out or
know, at least, what they're

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:57.950
supposed to do with this
piece of information.

00:25:57.950 --> 00:25:59.721
And then, we need
some kind of state.

00:25:59.721 --> 00:26:00.220
Right?

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:05.212
So in the case of list, it
may be size of the list.

00:26:05.212 --> 00:26:06.670
In the case of
check box, it may be

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:09.270
whether the item is
checked or unchecked,

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:11.770
and in the case of menu, it's
whether the menu contains

00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:14.410
a submenu, whatever it may be.

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:18.000
And so with these three
pieces of information,

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.750
the user, for the
most part, should

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:24.230
be able to figure out
the basic interface.

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:25.450
So--

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:27.684
COMPUTER: Safari.

00:26:27.684 --> 00:26:29.600
VICTOR TSARAN: So let
me go now to the browser

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:32.150
because I think that's
what we want to look at.

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:33.390
COMPUTER: Safari.

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:35.640
VICTOR TSARAN: So one of the
things we find on the web

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.170
is that it's a bit
less predictable.

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:42.340
When you work with desktop
APIs, they're pretty good.

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:45.010
And also, tomorrow
or after tomorrow,

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:49.100
if you come up to a computer,
you power it up, most likely,

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:51.640
your desktop is gonna look
the way you left it yesterday.

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:52.140
Right?

00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:56.170
Unless you let your kids
or partners or whoever mess

00:26:56.170 --> 00:26:57.891
around while you sleep.

00:26:57.891 --> 00:27:00.390
But for the most part, if you're
in control of your machine,

00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:02.160
you know that you're
gonna turn it on.

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.990
Icons are gonna be
in the same places.

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:06.420
The dock is going to
be in the same place.

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:08.350
Well, it's not the
same case with the web.

00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:08.870
Right?

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:13.160
Web is far less predictable as
far as this stuff is concerned,

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:17.310
so when we talk about the web,
the principals I just described

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:20.150
a couple minutes ago
are, I would say,

00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:21.950
they're so much more applicable.

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:24.370
You have to be like super
disciplined to make sure

00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:27.440
that all of your stuff has
items, has names, and has

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:30.540
states and all that
[INAUDIBLE] stuff.

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:32.680
Because on the
desktop, let's say,

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:35.550
once I know my desktop--
maybe, let's say,

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:37.950
if certain buttons
don't have names,

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:39.690
I mean, you know, life
sucks, but maybe I

00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:40.950
could remember them.

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:44.150
It's number five, so I just
like arrow key five times,

00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:45.750
and I get there.

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:48.592
On the web, I can't even predict
that I'm gonna go to YouTube

00:27:48.592 --> 00:27:51.050
and it's gonna look the same
tomorrow because you guys just

00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:52.633
pushed an new update
or is it the beta

00:27:52.633 --> 00:27:55.030
or maybe I got into
one of the buckets.

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:55.700
Who knows?

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:56.570
Right?

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:59.890
And so this stuff comes
so super important

00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:03.400
that you can't let it slip.

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:06.860
There's almost no excuse because
you can totally lose the user,

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:10.530
and the experience
could be disastrous.

00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:13.292
So why don't we have a quick
look at the YouTube page.

00:28:13.292 --> 00:28:15.250
And by the way, if you
guys have any questions,

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:18.300
feel free to interrupt me
because if you don't interrupt

00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:22.010
me, I may be talking here
for another three hours.

00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:22.852
And I don't know.

00:28:22.852 --> 00:28:24.268
How much time do
we actually have?

00:28:24.268 --> 00:28:24.732
Is it an hour?

00:28:24.732 --> 00:28:25.660
MALE SPEAKER 2:
We've got an hour--

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:27.080
VICTOR TSARAN: OK, cool.

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:35.260
OK, so I'll try to stay
close to the clock as I can.

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:37.980
OK, so here's the
very first thing

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:41.340
I'm gonna let you know is
that the-- well, you may have

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:42.980
guessed-- the screen
reader is a pretty

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:44.530
configurable piece of software.

00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:45.410
All right?

00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:48.590
It's not one size fits
for all because just

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:50.930
like there are many
preferences people have,

00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:53.830
starting from clothes
to colors, going

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:57.600
to browsers and
toolbars and whatnot.

00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.362
The screen reader
obviously isn't

00:28:59.362 --> 00:29:00.820
going to be the
same for everybody.

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:03.190
Some users may want
to speed it up.

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:05.800
Others may want to slow it down.

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:06.470
Some users--

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:09.370
COMPUTER: Default pitch--
Default rate, 36%.

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:10.690
Default voice, Alex.

00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:11.220
VICTOR TSARAN: Some users--

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:12.120
COMPUTER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:14.536
VICTOR TSARAN: Some users may
want to use different voice.

00:29:14.536 --> 00:29:16.547
COMPUTER: Def-- Alex.

00:29:16.547 --> 00:29:18.630
VICTOR TSARAN: Some users
use different languages.

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:21.530
I speak several languages,
so I have several speech

00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:24.640
synthesizers that I-- even
on YouTube, when I go in,

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.640
if I want to read
descriptions in that language,

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.890
I'll just switch to a
different synthesizer.

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:31.710
Some platforms have
gotten so smart

00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:41.400
like iPhone, for example, that
if it detects a link attribute,

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:44.860
it's gonna switch the speech
synthesizer on the fly.

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:49.430
So on the iPhone, because it has
25 built-in speech synthesizers

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:51.610
for different languages,
if I go to a page that

00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:53.660
contains multiple
languages, it's

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:56.780
gonna automatically switch
between the languages.

00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:59.020
A good example would
be wikipedia.org.

00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:01.510
When you go and there are
links in multiple languages,

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:04.430
they use their language
attribute really well,

00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:07.360
and so when I go
through Wikipedia

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:12.050
and it says which language is
the Wikipedia is available in,

00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:15.520
VoiceOver, the screen
reader on the iPhone,

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:18.610
is pretty smart to
switch those languages

00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:21.480
on the fly, which is
really, really cool.

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:23.800
We don't have that,
unfortunately, on VoiceOver

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:24.980
on the desktop.

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:28.485
Although, the feature has
been discussed many times,

00:30:28.485 --> 00:30:31.950
and hopefully, we'll
make it, one day, there.

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:34.380
OK.

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:36.500
The other thing that
screen readers do really

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:41.180
well is that they know
that one of the reasons

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:42.900
we're using the
computers-- we, I

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:44.440
mean blind people--
is that we want

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:46.550
to be as efficient as you guys.

00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:48.380
I don't want to be
going to the website

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:50.330
and-- while you can
scroll over the mouse

00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:53.859
and click, click, click,
click, in three seconds,

00:30:53.859 --> 00:30:54.900
you're doing your things.

00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:55.574
Right?

00:30:55.574 --> 00:30:57.740
I don't want to be tabbing
through the whole website

00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:00.020
every time I go to YouTube
or any other website.

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:01.270
Although, I could.

00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:03.160
It's certainly not the
most efficient way.

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:04.250
Right?

00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:11.840
If I looked at this page--
let's just have a look here.

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:12.900
COMPUTER: Form controls.

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:13.830
Two-- Headings.

00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:16.810
Links, 571 items.

00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:17.970
VICTOR TSARAN: OK?

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:20.900
So this thing has 571 links.

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:21.400
[CLICK]

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:22.150
COMPUTER: My sub--

00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:24.150
VICTOR TSARAN: And
that's only provided you

00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:30.330
guys have done your job right
and you have all your hrefs

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:35.350
and you don't do onclick
stuff and things like that.

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:39.484
Even with that, there's
still 571 tab stops.

00:31:39.484 --> 00:31:40.900
That's not something
I want to do.

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:42.740
I don't think you
want to do that.

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:44.650
Often times, though,
to be honest with you,

00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:46.100
especially beginner
users, that's

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:49.040
what they do because sometimes,
they don't know what to expect,

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:51.960
and also, there is a
population of users who

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:55.760
lost their sight
late in life, which

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.770
means they're not as adaptable.

00:31:57.770 --> 00:32:01.620
I lost my sight when I was five,
so I'm pretty adapted by now,

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:05.290
but there are a lot of people
who lose their sight at 40, 45,

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:07.940
and in addition to
psychological barrier, I mean,

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:10.680
they've got technical
barriers to deal with.

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:15.040
Now, suddenly, they don't
have that "look at the screen

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:17.380
and get going" kind of attitude.

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:19.660
Now, they have to look
through this straw

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:20.950
the way everybody else does.

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:22.450
And so they do start
tabbing, and it

00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:25.582
gets really, really frustrating.

00:32:25.582 --> 00:32:27.790
But once you get more
proficient with screen readers,

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:31.520
you start looking for other ways
to improve the way to navigate,

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:34.320
and one of those things is,
you probably heard about,

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.340
is called HTML headings.

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:39.880
And they're there for a reason
because with HTML headings,

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:42.630
if they're present on the
page, the screen reader

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:44.472
can take advantage of them.

00:32:44.472 --> 00:32:46.430
Because remember, it's
looking through the DOM,

00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:51.850
and it says, how many h1's,
h2's, h3's can I find there.

00:32:51.850 --> 00:32:55.034
And if it finds them,
here's how it looks.

00:32:55.034 --> 00:32:55.700
COMPUTER: Links.

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:57.241
VICTOR TSARAN: I'm
gonna pull this up

00:32:57.241 --> 00:32:58.520
with a screen reader and--

00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:01.290
COMPUTER: Headings, 199 items.

00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:04.760
VICTOR TSARAN: Still a lot, but
five times fewer than links.

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:05.990
Right?

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:09.550
And more importantly,
not only are there

00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:11.840
fewer headings
than links, there's

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:14.280
also something I can
learn about the page,

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:17.070
and there, I must say, you guys
are doing a pretty good job

00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:19.690
because your page is
pretty well-structured,

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:22.462
at least the home page.

00:33:22.462 --> 00:33:24.045
Once you get off the
home page, things

00:33:24.045 --> 00:33:26.971
get a little less predictable,
but we're looking at home page

00:33:26.971 --> 00:33:27.470
right now.

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:31.100
Do you see there's a
number right next to each

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:32.560
heading, to the left of it?

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:34.710
And that's telling
you what level,

00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:36.510
whether it's two or three.

00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:37.695
So we can see here--

00:33:37.695 --> 00:33:38.640
[CLICK]

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:40.640
COMPUTER: Two-- What to Watch.

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:42.460
Three-- Playlists.

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:44.150
Three-- Subscription.

00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:45.870
Two-- Recommended.

00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:47.354
Three-- three-- three-- three--

00:33:47.354 --> 00:33:49.020
VICTOR TSARAN: I'm
just gonna go through

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:50.436
that because
otherwise, you know--

00:33:50.436 --> 00:33:51.640
COMPUTER: Three-- 20.

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:52.620
VICTOR TSARAN: So
you've got the idea.

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:54.260
But you already see
some of the things

00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:55.929
that I would be
talking about, just

00:33:55.929 --> 00:33:57.220
by looking at the heading list.

00:33:57.220 --> 00:33:57.460
Right?

00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:58.709
Even though they're headings--

00:33:58.709 --> 00:34:04.961
COMPUTER: Three-- 18,
2,000, 14-- Three-- 20.

00:34:04.961 --> 00:34:05.960
VICTOR TSARAN: Uh, what?

00:34:08.834 --> 00:34:09.750
Oh, that's in Ukraine.

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:10.291
That's right.

00:34:10.291 --> 00:34:11.989
OK, sorry, sorry,
sorry. [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:11.989 --> 00:34:13.261
COMPUTER: Three--

00:34:13.261 --> 00:34:14.969
VICTOR TSARAN: Anyway,
so you can see now

00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:17.570
how I can take advantage
of that information.

00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:18.070
Well--

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:18.710
COMPUTER: My subscript--

00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:20.010
VICTOR TSARAN: Once I
learn my screen reader,

00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:21.551
I can actually tell
the screen reader

00:34:21.551 --> 00:34:23.850
to go just between
headings, too.

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:27.929
So this way, since you
guys done pretty good job,

00:34:27.929 --> 00:34:30.420
and I just want to look
at what major sections are

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:34.770
available in this page, there
are several ways I can do that.

00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:35.300
[CLICK]

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:36.230
COMPUTER: Vis--

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:38.360
VICTOR TSARAN: So I can
find the heading level two.

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:40.874
COMPUTER: Heading level two--
What to Watch, clickable.

00:34:40.874 --> 00:34:43.040
VICTOR TSARAN: And then I
can tell my screen reader,

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:45.650
OK, go to the next
heading level two.

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:48.730
COMPUTER: Heading level
two-- Recommended.

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:50.360
Heading level two-- two items.

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:50.900
[CLICK]

00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:54.930
24, recommended channel
for you, clickable.

00:34:54.930 --> 00:34:56.550
VICTOR TSARAN:
Yeah, this is where

00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:59.372
it should be switching to
a different language, but--

00:34:59.372 --> 00:35:00.580
COMPUTER: Heading level two--

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:01.080
[CLICK]

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:02.759
Associated Press.

00:35:02.759 --> 00:35:05.050
VICTOR TSARAN: OK, you also
hear something interesting.

00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:07.850
Did any of you notice
little click there?

00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:11.410
Like makes this click?

00:35:11.410 --> 00:35:13.720
COMPUTER: Heading level
two-- 2-- Heading level two--

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:14.220
[CLICK]

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:15.792
Associated Press.

00:35:15.792 --> 00:35:17.000
VICTOR TSARAN: Now, why this?

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:17.800
You hear the click.

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:20.070
Normally, you'll
hear the word "link,"

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:22.620
but because I'm a
bit more proficient

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:24.880
and I don't want to hear
link, link, link, link, link,

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:29.410
link, I told my screen
reader just to play a sound.

00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:31.482
So whenever there's a
link, it'll play a sound,

00:35:31.482 --> 00:35:36.310
and it'll play different sounds
for drop down, check boxes,

00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:37.250
and things like that.

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:40.040
It depends on the screen,
but some of them go crazy.

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:45.040
Chromebox, which is the
Google's own speech solution,

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:48.320
does a really good job with
what they call earcons,

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.290
and they really do
a pretty good-- I

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:54.190
like the way Google Chromebox
actually uses sounds.

00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:57.180
Sometimes, it's a bit too
much, but for the most part,

00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:58.450
it's pretty good.

00:35:58.450 --> 00:36:01.200
And so most screen readers will
have some kind of functionality

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:06.830
to substitute controls
by sound, but remember,

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:09.170
they need that semantic
piece of information

00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:12.049
to be able to know what sound
to play because if the screen

00:36:12.049 --> 00:36:13.590
reader doesn't know
that it's a link,

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:17.329
guess what, it's not
going to play the sound.

00:36:17.329 --> 00:36:18.620
OK, so we got through headings.

00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:21.840
This is pretty good, and you
can see I can go back and forth.

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:24.460
I also have an
ability to-- so let's

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:26.199
say if I go to heading three.

00:36:26.199 --> 00:36:27.490
COMPUTER: Heading level three--

00:36:27.490 --> 00:36:27.989
[CLICK]

00:36:27.989 --> 00:36:28.700
Raw, colon.

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:30.439
Big rig stuck in Illinois swamp.

00:36:30.439 --> 00:36:31.480
VICTOR TSARAN: All right.

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:34.650
So then, I can move
my screen reader

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:36.119
to next level heading three.

00:36:36.119 --> 00:36:37.410

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:42.660
VICTOR TSARAN: OK, and
so on and so forth.

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:49.350
Now, when I hear a link, I
obviously can activate it.

00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:51.569
In this case, since
I know it's a link--

00:36:51.569 --> 00:36:52.860
COMPUTER: Heading level three--

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:54.480
VICTOR TSARAN: I
can open the video.

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.985
COMPUTER: Obama advisor
skips House hearing, press.

00:36:56.985 --> 00:36:57.640
[CLICK]

00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:59.234

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:06.160
VICTOR TSARAN: OK.

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:07.870
So I want to have
a look at this page

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:10.310
because this is where many
users spend their time.

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:16.820
So the very first thing
I hear from users--

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:19.320
and I wanted to let you know.

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:21.800
I know there's obviously
business decisions behind this.

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:24.091
I wanted to let you know
because I hear this from users

00:37:24.091 --> 00:37:25.999
all the time,
especially blind users

00:37:25.999 --> 00:37:28.540
are not big fans when the video
starts playing automatically.

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:29.220
Why?

00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:32.010
Oftentimes, you just want
to read the description.

00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:34.270
You may not even want
to watch the video.

00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:38.260
And so let's see how fast we can
find the play controls in here.

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:40.030
So I'm right here on the page.

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:42.581
I open the page, so at
this point, remember, guys,

00:37:42.581 --> 00:37:43.080
the straw.

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:43.580
Right?

00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:44.840
Can you imagine the straw?

00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:46.800
Straw, straw, straw, straw.

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:47.300
Right?

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:48.674
I don't know what's
on this page.

00:37:48.674 --> 00:37:50.860
I'm just gonna start
tapping, see what I can find.

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:52.460
COMPUTER: Try something new.

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:54.230
Search, search text field.

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:56.900
VICTOR TSARAN: OK, so you placed
me into the search by default.

00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:59.050
COMPUTER: Search button.

00:37:59.050 --> 00:38:00.160
Play button.

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:01.320
VICTOR TSARAN: OK, cool.

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:03.310
So at least of
the play controls,

00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:07.430
and I think you've
been using the tab

00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:09.930
index to do some
of these things.

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:12.500
So this is probably
for the right reason.

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:15.297
I could understand why this is
done, and this is probably--

00:38:15.297 --> 00:38:16.130
COMPUTER: Caps lock.

00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:17.130
Caps lock off--

00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:18.020
VICTOR TSARAN: Sorry.

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:22.150
Well, the users can quickly
jump to the play, play button.

00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:23.850
Let's tab through this thing.

00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:25.775
COMPUTER: New toggle button.

00:38:25.775 --> 00:38:28.270
VICTOR TSARAN: OK, new toggle.

00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:28.850

00:38:28.850 --> 00:38:31.835
COMPUTER: 100% volume slider.

00:38:31.835 --> 00:38:34.184
VICTOR TSARAN: This is good.

00:38:34.184 --> 00:38:34.920
Let's see here.

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:36.487

00:38:39.425 --> 00:38:41.590

00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:51.550

00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:52.092

00:38:52.092 --> 00:38:52.883
VICTOR TSARAN: OK--

00:38:52.883 --> 00:38:53.990

VICTOR TSARAN: We're back
into the navigation bar.

00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:57.330
OK.

00:38:57.330 --> 00:38:58.940
Here's a question for you.

00:38:58.940 --> 00:38:59.903
What's missing here?

00:39:07.298 --> 00:39:09.612
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:09.612 --> 00:39:10.570
VICTOR TSARAN: It's OK.

00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:11.403
We didn't get there.

00:39:11.403 --> 00:39:12.920
Remember, I always
have my headings.

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:14.455
I didn't even start
looking at that,

00:39:14.455 --> 00:39:16.580
but what would you be doing
with a video like that.

00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:17.290
I mean, come on.

00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:18.470
It's a government video.

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:22.550
Would you want to
skip around and--

00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:26.860
OK.

00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:30.780
So what's missing here?

00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:39.474
Yeah, and-- How many of
you guys use shortcut keys?

00:39:39.474 --> 00:39:40.890
Do you know what
the shortcut keys

00:39:40.890 --> 00:39:42.306
are for skipping
around the video?

00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:47.704
Somebody said no.

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:53.262
OK, cool.

00:39:53.262 --> 00:39:53.970
Well, guess what.

00:39:53.970 --> 00:39:56.011
I would know either if I
didn't read it somewhere

00:39:56.011 --> 00:39:58.710
or I didn't go,
you know-- So, OK,

00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:02.429
without being too mysterious,
there are two problems.

00:40:02.429 --> 00:40:04.470
One you have already
identified which is the seat

00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:06.142
control itself.

00:40:06.142 --> 00:40:08.350
I don't actually even know
where it is on the screen.

00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:10.450
I think it's somewhere
because I believe

00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:11.920
if you start using
shortcut keys,

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:15.540
it eventually gains the focus,
but the bigger problem here

00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:19.150
is that you guys have this
fabulous facility for shortcut

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:19.650
keys.

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:22.800
If use j and l, it lets you
actually rewind and forward

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:27.260
the video, and if you use k,
it lets you play and pause.

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:30.010
Pretty cool, but how
would you know about it.

00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:32.040
All right?

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:34.150
So discoverability
of these features

00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:36.800
is something I would like to
encourage you to think about,

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.810
and you have a good
examples around Google.

00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:41.190
So for example, if you press
question mark on many Google

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:44.800
websites, it's gonna pull up
the lists of shortcut keys.

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:48.900
So you can rely on some
of those known techniques

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:51.320
to let users know, hey,
we've got these really

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:53.570
amazing shortcut
keys to think about.

00:40:53.570 --> 00:40:57.820
Twitter has done something
even more interesting.

00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:00.100
When you load this
Twitter page, twitter.com,

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:02.510
for the first time, they
play this hidden message

00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:04.420
for screen reader
users, and it says,

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:06.790
did you know that Twitter
has shortcut keys.

00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:11.300
Press question mark to read all
of the available shortcut keys.

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:11.800
[CLICK]

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:12.490
COMPUTER: Guide.

00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:13.860
VICTOR TSARAN: Actually,
do you have question mark?

00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:15.084
Let's try.

00:41:15.084 --> 00:41:17.430
No, I don't think so.

00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:17.950
OK.

00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:19.450
So for those of you
who didn't know,

00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:22.230
there are shortcut keys,
j and l, to move forward

00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:24.180
and backward and k's pausing.

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:26.280
This is really cool.

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:28.280
Honestly speaking though,
to be honest with you,

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:30.529
I'd love to see though j and
k to move between videos.

00:41:30.529 --> 00:41:33.390
That would be really
cool, but anyway, that's

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:34.700
not for me to decide.

00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:36.370
So remember about these things.

00:41:36.370 --> 00:41:36.870
Right?

00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:39.500
Discoverability is a big
thing, and the easier

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:43.080
you can make it for screen
reader users to discover stuff,

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.850
the happier they
will be overall.

00:41:45.850 --> 00:41:46.800
OK.

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:47.420
So--

00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:48.080

00:41:58.969 --> 00:41:59.801
VICTOR TSARAN: Good.

00:41:59.801 --> 00:42:01.080
So that works really well.

00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:03.620
COMPUTER: Press
unmute toggle button.

00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:05.310
1-- Mute toggle--

00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:08.510
VICTOR TSARAN: OK, so let's
have a look at the settings

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:11.930
for-- I understand this is
the settings for the video.

00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:14.600
COMPUTER: 100% volume slider.

00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:16.310
Watch later button.

00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:18.180
Settings button.

00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:19.029
VICTOR TSARAN: OK.

00:42:19.029 --> 00:42:20.320
This is settings for the video.

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:21.510
Is that correct?

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:23.120
My assumption's correct?

00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:24.563
Or this is for the player.

00:42:24.563 --> 00:42:25.438
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:31.820
VICTOR TSARAN: See you guys
are, yourself, you're not sure.

00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:32.530
OK.

00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:33.420
Just kidding.

00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:36.920
So maybe a better
label would be,

00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:39.881
potentially, but
that's only level two.

00:42:39.881 --> 00:42:41.630
So anyway, let's go
to the Settings panel.

00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:43.640
So I'm gonna hit enter on this.

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:45.400
COMPUTER: Annotations-- on, off.

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:46.720
Speed-- normal.

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:51.466
Quality-- auto, paren left,
360p, right paren, group.

00:42:51.466 --> 00:42:52.340
VICTOR TSARAN: Great.

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:54.260
So probably a div
came up on the screen

00:42:54.260 --> 00:43:00.150
and it's reading the
contents of the whole div.

00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:00.710
OK.

00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:03.180
I mean, you know, whatever.

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:05.390
I will not worry about
that particular part,

00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:07.730
but what I'm worried about
is the actual controls.

00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:09.150
So let's have a quick look.

00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:10.610
I'm gonna tab
through this thing.

00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:11.443
COMPUTER: On button.

00:43:17.065 --> 00:43:19.440
VICTOR TSARAN: I'm just pausing
so you guys have a chance

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:22.160
to process it.

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:23.410
OK, let's go next.

00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:25.450
COMPUTER: Off button.

00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:26.890
VICTOR TSARAN: Hm, OK.

00:43:26.890 --> 00:43:29.742
Are these two separate things
or part of the same thing?

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:34.400
Oh, it's even worse.

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:37.531
Yeah, thanks.

00:43:37.531 --> 00:43:38.530
COMPUTER: Normal button.

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:43.554
VICTOR TSARAN: Who are
we talking about here.

00:43:43.554 --> 00:43:45.645
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:45.645 --> 00:43:46.520
VICTOR TSARAN: Right.

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:49.776
This is a speed, so
it's really a combo box.

00:43:49.776 --> 00:43:51.650
Yeah, thanks for letting
me know, by the way.

00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:52.450
That's good.

00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:52.950
OK, cool.

00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:54.300
Let's go next.

00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:59.049
COMPUTER: Auto, left paren,
360p, right paren, button.

00:43:59.049 --> 00:44:00.090
VICTOR TSARAN: Let's see.

00:44:00.090 --> 00:44:02.620
This is DPI?

00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:05.591
No, [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:05.591 --> 00:44:06.090
Quality.

00:44:06.090 --> 00:44:06.250
Right, right.

00:44:06.250 --> 00:44:07.090
Sorry.

00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:07.890
Yeah.

00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:08.390
OK.

00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:11.430
So but this says-- it's not
clear because it says auto

00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:12.940
and then, it says 300--

00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:14.772
COMPUTER: Auto, left
paren, 360p, right--

00:44:14.772 --> 00:44:15.688
VICTOR TSARAN: Oh, OK.

00:44:15.688 --> 00:44:18.890
This is the auto, which
is 360-- OK, cool.

00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:22.528
So but I assume this is
also drop down, then.

00:44:22.528 --> 00:44:25.017
So let's press Enter on
this and see what happens.

00:44:25.017 --> 00:44:29.860
COMPUTER: 360p,
240p, auto, group.

00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:30.620
VICTOR TSARAN: OK.

00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:32.450
So the new div came up.

00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:35.150
Let me see if I
can use arrow keys.

00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:36.674
Nope.

00:44:36.674 --> 00:44:37.530
OK.

00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:38.440
Let's see tab.

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:40.910
COMPUTER: 360p button.

00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:43.070
240p button.

00:44:43.070 --> 00:44:44.210
Auto button.

00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:45.800
VICTOR TSARAN:
Well, you see here--

00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:49.605
so even though, technically,
it's accessible,

00:44:49.605 --> 00:44:50.980
from the user
point of view, it's

00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:52.430
confusing because now,
you don't actually

00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:53.530
know this is drop down.

00:44:53.530 --> 00:44:54.030
Right?

00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:57.040
It looks like separate controls,
and because they don't really

00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:00.590
have labels, you could easily
get confused by thinking,

00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:04.600
oh, these are totally
three different things

00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:05.510
I'm looking at.

00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:07.520
So you can see the
drop down's different,

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:08.980
and I see this all
over YouTube, so

00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:10.705
I'm just showing
you some examples.

00:45:10.705 --> 00:45:12.830
I assume you guys are gonna
be doing your homework.

00:45:12.830 --> 00:45:15.650
But the drop down is
definitely something

00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:17.990
I would like you
guys to see, looking

00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:19.600
at because you
have a lot of them,

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:20.495
and they're super important.

00:45:20.495 --> 00:45:20.995
Right?

00:45:20.995 --> 00:45:23.010
Because a lot of
that stuff allows

00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:24.995
you to configure your
YouTube experience,

00:45:24.995 --> 00:45:31.428
so I think this is definitely
something worth looking at.

00:45:31.428 --> 00:45:33.740
OK, so I press Escape.

00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:35.155
I don't exactly
know-- I presume.

00:45:35.155 --> 00:45:36.738
I don't know if it
collapsed anything.

00:45:36.738 --> 00:45:37.670
COMPUTER: Play button.

00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:38.290
Search bu--

00:45:38.290 --> 00:45:41.574
VICTOR TSARAN: I think it
collapsed the Settings panel.

00:45:41.574 --> 00:45:42.490
Now, notice one thing.

00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:46.470
What happened here is--
and I see this quite a lot.

00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:48.970
I keep fighting
about this at Paypal

00:45:48.970 --> 00:45:53.210
as well-- is that what we need
in terms of keyboard focus

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:57.210
is every time you collapse
an expandable region

00:45:57.210 --> 00:46:00.230
or div or panels.

00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:02.760
I'm even afraid to say the
right term because there's so

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:04.460
many terms, sight
panel, over panel,

00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:08.670
under panel, floating panel,
fly out, fly under, fly over,

00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:09.722
and so on and so forth.

00:46:09.722 --> 00:46:11.180
You hear designers
using that term.

00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:12.471
Then you're like, OK, whatever.

00:46:12.471 --> 00:46:13.730
Just call it panel.

00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:16.260
Anytime there's a panel
that comes up on the screen

00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:19.130
and the user
collapses it, you want

00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:22.530
to make sure the focus comes
back to the place we started.

00:46:22.530 --> 00:46:23.280
Why?

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.680
In your instance, maybe
it's less of an issue

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:28.420
because you placed me back
somewhere around the Play

00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:31.702
button, but this is
not always the case.

00:46:31.702 --> 00:46:33.535
So the user may end up,
and they're not sure

00:46:33.535 --> 00:46:34.951
if they're supposed
to tab forward

00:46:34.951 --> 00:46:38.820
or backward because they want
to be where they were before.

00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:40.870
So remember, this
rule, very important.

00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:43.820
Whenever you collapse something,
your focus should go back to

00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:45.572
where?

00:46:45.572 --> 00:46:46.280
You guys tell me.

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:48.370
Where were before?

00:46:48.370 --> 00:46:48.870
Settings.

00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:49.369
Right?

00:46:49.369 --> 00:46:51.450
COMPUTER: 65-- Play button.

00:46:51.450 --> 00:46:53.230
Mute to-- Settings button.

00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:54.730
VICTOR TSARAN: So
I want to be here.

00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:00.790
There's something else about
these so these buttons,

00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:03.860
in particular, this
panel Settings.

00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:07.552
How would you know actually
that this is a drop down?

00:47:07.552 --> 00:47:08.510
You wouldn't know that.

00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:09.009
Right?

00:47:09.009 --> 00:47:10.880
Because it actually says button.

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:14.320
Moreover, this Settings
actually isn't even a drop down.

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:16.791
It's actually an
expandable region.

00:47:16.791 --> 00:47:18.290
So here I want to
mention something.

00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:20.870
How many of you guys
are familiar with ARIA?

00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:23.680
Anybody here knows about ARIA?

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:24.500
OK.

00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:28.850
So wherever we
can, obviously, we

00:47:28.850 --> 00:47:31.330
encourage people to
use native controls.

00:47:31.330 --> 00:47:36.830
I know that browsers are pretty
unforgiving as far as letting

00:47:36.830 --> 00:47:40.320
us to style native controls,
and especially drop downs

00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:45.130
are really a pain in
the dot, dot, dot.

00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:47.970
So we need to rely on
ARIA in many instances

00:47:47.970 --> 00:47:49.710
to make these things accessible.

00:47:49.710 --> 00:47:53.220
But before we even get to
ARIA which is even the sugar,

00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:56.390
really, because it provides
important semantic information,

00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:59.540
or I like to call
it super semantics,

00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:02.155
provides this information, but
really, first and foremost, we

00:48:02.155 --> 00:48:04.280
really need to start with
the keyboard interaction.

00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:04.780
Right?

00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:07.380
Once you get that
worked out, then we

00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:09.980
can start working on ARIA.

00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:12.210
COMPUTER: Spotlight
search text field.

00:48:12.210 --> 00:48:13.532
Safari-- TextMate--

00:48:13.532 --> 00:48:15.990
VICTOR TSARAN: So one of the
things you could be doing here

00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:19.110
is-- for those of you-- I heard
only people on the left side

00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:22.170
said they know
about ARIA, so I'll

00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:24.250
not to go too deep into
it, but essentially,

00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:28.110
think of ARIA as
auxiliary markup

00:48:28.110 --> 00:48:31.180
that you can pepper
your HTML code with,

00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:34.900
and it'll sort of provide
additional information

00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:40.420
for the stuff that's not
natively available in HTML.

00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:42.120
Some good examples
would be tab panels.

00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:43.554
COMPUTER: Tab panels.

00:48:43.554 --> 00:48:44.970
VICTOR TSARAN: And
we got sliders.

00:48:44.970 --> 00:48:48.590
There's nothing in
HTML like a slider.

00:48:48.590 --> 00:48:50.520
Well, we have some
stuff in HTML5

00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:53.060
like type in close
range and stuff,

00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:55.840
but it's not even supported
well by old browsers

00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:58.940
and assistive technology so
we're in a bit of a problem

00:48:58.940 --> 00:48:59.440
there.

00:49:04.286 --> 00:49:05.410
Yeah, so we got tab panels.

00:49:05.410 --> 00:49:06.555
We've got sliders.

00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:12.200
What else do we got?

00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:15.430
I mean, even pop-ups.

00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:17.250
Right?

00:49:17.250 --> 00:49:19.010
COMPUTER: Pop-ups.

00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:19.910
New lot.

00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:22.670
VICTOR TSARAN: So ARIA, it
stands for Advanced Rich

00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:25.746
Internet Applications into
W3 spec at this point,

00:49:25.746 --> 00:49:28.120
and what it is, as I mentioned,
it's an additional markup

00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:31.960
that you can specify
inside your HTML

00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:36.830
to give additional
meaning to your controls.

00:49:36.830 --> 00:49:38.884
So let's say we're
talking about settings.

00:49:38.884 --> 00:49:40.300
What could we do
with the settings

00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:41.846
to improve the
functionality there?

00:49:41.846 --> 00:49:43.220
Well we could do
something like--

00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:44.469
COMPUTER: Less div.

00:49:44.469 --> 00:49:45.760
VICTOR TSARAN: Let's just say--

00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:47.160
COMPUTER: Id equals quote.

00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:49.027
VICTOR TSARAN: --ID settings--

00:49:49.027 --> 00:49:50.110
COMPUTER: Id equals quote.

00:49:54.354 --> 00:50:00.080
Less, button, greater, settings,
less, Settings, less, less,

00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:01.164
less, slash, div, greater.

00:50:01.164 --> 00:50:03.621
VICTOR TSARAN: Well, you know,
this is a button, that's OK,

00:50:03.621 --> 00:50:05.220
but it's not really a button.

00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:08.600
So what can we do to make this
work better for screen reader

00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:09.820
users?

00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:12.450
Well, one way we could
do this, you could say--

00:50:12.450 --> 00:50:15.140
COMPUTER: O, n,
greater, less, button.

00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:16.800
VICTOR TSARAN: You
could say, ARIA--

00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:18.722
COMPUTER: ARIA, dash.

00:50:18.722 --> 00:50:19.680
VICTOR TSARAN: Pop-up--

00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:21.715
COMPUTER: ARIA,
dash, has greater.

00:50:21.715 --> 00:50:24.090
VICTOR TSARAN: And when you
do that, the screen reader is

00:50:24.090 --> 00:50:28.270
going to announce,
settings button has pop-up.

00:50:28.270 --> 00:50:32.260
And then, of course, you still
have to do all your JavaScript

00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:37.380
things with keyboard controls,
keyboard focus, and stuff

00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:41.040
like that, but this is
how simple this stuff is.

00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:42.320
Right?

00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:45.681
Now, there's more
about ARIA than this.

00:50:45.681 --> 00:50:47.180
I was just doing
one little example,

00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:51.210
but this could be one way you
could replicate this problem.

00:50:51.210 --> 00:50:54.920
And unfortunately for
expendable, collapsible

00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:57.840
regions, we don't really have
a native solution in HTML,

00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:00.125
so we have to rely
on ARIA to provider

00:51:00.125 --> 00:51:03.700
that auxiliary information.

00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:04.870
COMPUTER: Safar--

00:51:04.870 --> 00:51:07.820
VICTOR TSARAN: OK, so we
looked at those panels.

00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:09.540
Now, let's go to the video.

00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:11.580
Let me just check,
quickly, the time.

00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:15.354
COMPUTER: July 25, 11:53 AM.

00:51:15.354 --> 00:51:17.270
VICTOR TSARAN: Wow, I
knew that I would talk--

00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:19.885
COMPUTER: Heading level one--
Obama advisor skips House--

00:51:19.885 --> 00:51:21.260
VICTOR TSARAN: So
again, you guys

00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:23.950
are doing good job here
because your heading level

00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:26.140
one is actually the
title of the video.

00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:28.990
I really, really like that
because if I pulled up

00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:30.110
the list of headings--

00:51:30.110 --> 00:51:34.247
COMPUTER: Headings, 12 item--
two-- one-- Obama advi--

00:51:34.247 --> 00:51:36.080
VICTOR TSARAN: This is
my heading level one.

00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:36.580
All right?

00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:39.980
And what I want to see
because this is the reason

00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:42.159
I came to this page.

00:51:42.159 --> 00:51:43.200
COMPUTER: Heading level--

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:43.630
VICTOR TSARAN: There's one.

00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:19.080
Right?

00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:21.240
So I do want to mention a
couple of things about alt text

00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:22.865
because Marcel told
me there are always

00:52:22.865 --> 00:52:24.840
lot of questions about this.

00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:26.590
It's one of those
interesting topics

00:52:26.590 --> 00:52:31.090
that while so
seemingly tiny compared

00:52:31.090 --> 00:52:33.870
to other interesting
and complex things

00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:36.930
we have to deal with
today in Web 2.0,

00:52:36.930 --> 00:52:38.380
but it is yet the
one that's often

00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:41.280
overlooked because
it so much has

00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:46.950
to do with the way we
perceive information that it's

00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:50.182
oftentimes not easy to
analyze it by a computer.

00:52:50.182 --> 00:52:52.140
So a couple of things I
want to point out here.

00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:54.660
I'm looking at a couple
of images on this page.

00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:57.190
There is one you wouldn't
notice doesn't have an alt text.

00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:57.690
Right?

00:52:57.690 --> 00:52:58.280

VICTOR TSARAN: OK?

00:53:04.167 --> 00:53:05.750
And then, there are
a couple of others

00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:07.041
I wanted to let you know about.

00:53:07.041 --> 00:53:07.670
This guy.

00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:09.094

COMPUTER: Default

00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:15.830
VICTOR TSARAN: So what I
would suggest because you

00:53:15.830 --> 00:53:18.670
guys are using the little
thumbnails on YouTube,

00:53:18.670 --> 00:53:21.490
and your images are an important
part of sort of experience

00:53:21.490 --> 00:53:27.290
to enhance how people
look at YouTube.

00:53:27.290 --> 00:53:28.620
Think carefully.

00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:31.620
Not every image needs to
have an alt attribute.

00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:32.400
Right?

00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:35.130
Some images,
perhaps, it's better

00:53:35.130 --> 00:53:37.070
if they don't even
have any alt attribute,

00:53:37.070 --> 00:53:40.980
or I should say differently,
but like these two images, photo

00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:45.010
and default, honestly speaking,
it's a waste of my time

00:53:45.010 --> 00:53:46.800
because I have to go
through this stuff

00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:48.300
and I was like, I hear photo.

00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:50.570
I don't know what
photo it is, so if you

00:53:50.570 --> 00:53:53.550
want to really provide
a good experience,

00:53:53.550 --> 00:53:55.470
you either put in
enough metadata

00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:59.640
to say what kind of photo it is
or just maybe even completely

00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:00.880
silence it.

00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:02.100
Or things like default.

00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:05.580
I don't even know what
exactly this is referring to.

very simple, again,

00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:24.770
if you want to have your images
and have no alt text, you just

00:54:24.770 --> 00:54:25.370
put empty--

00:54:25.370 --> 00:54:26.770

00:54:26.770 --> 00:54:27.510
VICTOR TSARAN:
--around this stuff,

00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:29.884
and basically, you're telling
the screen reader, shut up.

00:54:29.884 --> 00:54:31.410
There's no image.

00:54:31.410 --> 00:54:32.390
Forget about it.

00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:33.330
All right?

00:54:33.330 --> 00:54:35.985
If you do have alt text,
you just do alt equals

00:54:35.985 --> 00:54:36.610
COMPUTER: Alt--

00:54:36.610 --> 00:54:38.360
VICTOR TSARAN:
--obviously, and then, just

00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:41.100
put whatever text maybe.

00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:44.760
Let's just say if
it's Obama's picture--

00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:46.950
I don't know what
happened, like Obama--

00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:50.727
COMPUTER: Alt, at
the White House.

00:54:50.727 --> 00:54:52.810
VICTOR TSARAN: Maybe you
can put the word "photo."

00:54:52.810 --> 00:54:57.180
COMPUTER: Left paren, quote,
new lo-- alt equals, quote,

00:54:57.180 --> 00:54:59.870
Obama at the White House, left
paren, photo, right paren,

00:54:59.870 --> 00:55:00.750
quote.

00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:02.830
VICTOR TSARAN: So
I always prefer

00:55:02.830 --> 00:55:05.590
if you do want to say that
it's a photo or a thumbnail,

00:55:05.590 --> 00:55:08.071
put it at the very end
because ultimately, user

00:55:08.071 --> 00:55:10.320
is going to know that it's
an image because the screen

00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:11.861
reader is already
going to tell them,

00:55:11.861 --> 00:55:13.750
image, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:17.790
So really, they just need
to know that it's an image,

00:55:17.790 --> 00:55:20.820
and if you don't have
enough information just

00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:22.040
get rid of that stuff.

00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:26.080
It's really probably
wasting your bytes as well.

then we need to talk.

VICTOR TSARAN: OK.

00:56:05.290 --> 00:56:07.140
This is another very
interesting pattern

00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:10.820
that occurs quite a lot
on using content websites.

00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:14.840
When you have a thumbnail
or a logo of a company,

00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:16.460
and you wanted to
make it clickable.

00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:16.960
Right?

00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:20.580
So you can't really
wrap it up with an href,

00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:23.390
so what we end up doing is
that we have two tab stops.

00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:24.040
Right?

00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:25.380
We end up with two tab stop.

00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:27.120
I don't think
that's intentional.

00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:29.750
One tab stop is a
clickable image.

00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:32.010
In this case, it's a
log of Associated Press,

00:56:32.010 --> 00:56:34.560
if I understand this
correctly, and the other one

00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:36.940
is the actual-- I would
imagine it's a website.

00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:37.700
Right?

00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:38.730
Let's just check this.

00:56:38.730 --> 00:56:44.661
COMPUTER:

00:56:44.661 --> 00:56:46.910

take me to their channel.

00:56:46.910 --> 00:56:48.830
Let's look at the
URL on their image.

00:56:48.830 --> 00:56:49.590
COMPUTER: Image.

00:56:55.831 --> 00:56:56.580
VICTOR TSARAN: OK.

00:56:56.580 --> 00:57:00.990
So you see we have the same
target, but two tap stops.

00:57:00.990 --> 00:57:04.470
So if I'm looking at the channel
that has a bunch of videos,

00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:08.130
it basically means that I
have to tab twice per video.

00:57:08.130 --> 00:57:10.330
Right?

00:57:10.330 --> 00:57:16.580
So there's a bunch of
solutions people thought about.

00:57:16.580 --> 00:57:21.750
One idea would be to use
tab index equals minus 1.

00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:25.260
So you can take the
stuff out of tab order.

00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:26.790
Another thing maybe
to think about,

00:57:26.790 --> 00:57:29.970
maybe this is where you
don't want to make into href.

00:57:29.970 --> 00:57:34.150
Make it a clickable element, but
at least a screen reader user

00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:36.130
isn't going to be
able to tap to that.

00:57:36.130 --> 00:57:38.500
So I leave it up to you how
you guys solve this problem,

00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:41.874
but I just wanted to show it
to you that this is actually

00:57:41.874 --> 00:57:42.790

already labels.

you'd be like 70% good.

00:58:19.525 --> 00:58:21.382

00:58:29.410 --> 00:58:31.000
So use either
disable attribute--

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.860
we can also use an ARIA element.

00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:35.120
ARIA, there's
disabled equals true.

00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:36.730
But if you can, I
would use disable

00:58:36.730 --> 00:58:41.080
because it's probably gonna
also expose it to the browser.

00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:43.240
So you do you have that.

00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:43.740
Yeah.

00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:45.830
And it'll definitely--
it's gonna

00:58:45.830 --> 00:58:47.590
tell me dimmed or
something like that.

00:58:47.590 --> 00:58:48.923
It depends on the screen reader.

00:58:48.923 --> 00:58:51.250
VoiceOver on the Mac is
gonna tell you dimmed,

00:58:51.250 --> 00:58:53.560
and VoiceOver on Windows
is gonna say grayed out.

00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:56.800
They have different terminology,
but it will say something.

00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:59.110
COMPUTER: Button.

00:58:59.110 --> 00:58:59.830
I like this.

00:58:59.830 --> 00:59:00.530
Like button.

00:59:06.370 --> 00:59:08.730
VICTOR TSARAN: I like
this like like what?

00:59:08.730 --> 00:59:09.900
It's like an oxymoron.

00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:11.610
Right?

00:59:11.610 --> 00:59:12.380
COMPUTER: Button.

00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:13.060
I like this.

00:59:13.060 --> 00:59:14.945
Like button.

00:59:14.945 --> 00:59:17.570
VICTOR TSARAN: So what should I
do now if I-- Like do I like it

00:59:17.570 --> 00:59:19.390
or dislike it?

00:59:19.390 --> 00:59:20.550
Anyway, you get the idea.

00:59:20.550 --> 00:59:22.240
Right?

00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:23.690
COMPUTER: I dislike this button.

00:59:25.902 --> 00:59:27.860
VICTOR TSARAN: It actually
sounds kind of cool.

00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:29.060
I dislike this button.

00:59:29.060 --> 00:59:29.560
See?

00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:30.126
It's like--

00:59:30.126 --> 00:59:31.000
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:32.416
VICTOR TSARAN: No,
the reader just

00:59:32.416 --> 00:59:34.170
did [INAUDIBLE] I dislike this.

00:59:34.170 --> 00:59:35.747
It's of course for fun.

00:59:35.747 --> 00:59:36.580
It's not your fault.

00:59:36.580 --> 00:59:39.370
But anyway, I think you
have the same problem

00:59:39.370 --> 00:59:40.286
with-- I've seen it.

00:59:40.286 --> 00:59:41.910
I can't remember
right now, but there's

00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:45.360
a button when they ask
you to unsubscribe--

00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:46.360
Let me see if it's here.

00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:47.710
COMPUTER: About button.

00:59:47.710 --> 00:59:49.070
Share button.

00:59:49.070 --> 00:59:50.440
Add to button.

00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:52.070
Report button.

00:59:52.070 --> 00:59:58.214
http://smarturl.it/associatedpress.

00:59:58.214 --> 01:00:01.987
http:/-- It's a smart URL?

01:00:01.987 --> 01:00:02.987
Something, I don't know.

01:00:02.987 --> 01:00:03.486
Whatever.

01:00:03.486 --> 01:00:04.390
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:05.771
VICTOR TSARAN: No, I will.

01:00:05.771 --> 01:00:06.270
Yeah, OK.

01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:10.285
COMPUTER: Unsubscribe button.

01:00:10.285 --> 01:00:12.410
VICTOR TSARAN: Yeah, it
seems like it's been fixed.

01:00:12.410 --> 01:00:14.110
It used to be the
same problem, but it

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:18.150
would say subscribed,
unsubscribed, subscribed,

01:00:18.150 --> 01:00:20.350
like three times or
something, similar to what

01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:22.780
we see with "I like
this like," but I think

01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:25.212
maybe somebody already
figured that out.

01:00:25.212 --> 01:00:26.860
COMPUTER: I like--
I dislike-- About.

01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:27.390
Share.

01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:30.015
VICTOR TSARAN: Let's look at the
sharing one because that's-- I

01:00:30.015 --> 01:00:30.880
think we're gonna--

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:36.430
COMPUTER:
Http://youtu.be/lhvlumlig3g

01:00:36.430 --> 01:00:38.430
content selected edit text.

01:00:38.430 --> 01:00:39.420
VICTOR TSARAN: OK.

01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:43.920
So even though this is super
obvious that this is a URL,

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:47.680
some kind of label would be
really nice that says something

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:51.470
like URL to share
or address to share.

01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:53.780
Right?

01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:54.970
So for me this is obvious.

01:00:54.970 --> 01:00:55.470
Right?

01:00:55.470 --> 01:00:56.900
I read [INAUDIBLE] HTTP.

01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:58.441
I mean, maybe other
users don't know.

01:00:58.441 --> 01:00:59.550
Is it a Tweet widget?

01:00:59.550 --> 01:01:00.260
Is it a share?

01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:03.679
So keeping the labels in
mine, and let's actually

01:01:03.679 --> 01:01:05.220
see if there's a
label on the screen.

01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:05.500
[ALERT]

01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:06.260
COMPUTER: http:--

01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:06.760
[ALERT]

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:07.800
Button.

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:08.670
Button.

01:01:08.670 --> 01:01:10.000
Button.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.620
http-- Start at, colon-- http:--

01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:14.370
VICTOR TSARAN: OK.

01:01:14.370 --> 01:01:15.620
I don't think there's a label.

01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:18.500
So you rely on the fact that the
visual users know what it is.

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:19.820
Right?

01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:21.230
So do you do in this situation?

01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:22.260
So I'm gonna give you
a couple of things.

01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:23.760
COMPUTER: TextMate-- Text--

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:25.530
VICTOR TSARAN: Let's say your
designers are like, no, we're

01:01:25.530 --> 01:01:26.580
not gonna put tape.

01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:28.000
It's gonna steal our pixels.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.320
Nah, no way.

01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:31.167
COMPUTER: All-- New line.

01:01:31.167 --> 01:01:33.250
VICTOR TSARAN: Welcome to
ARIA, so we have, again,

01:01:33.250 --> 01:01:34.550
a possibility here.

01:01:34.550 --> 01:01:37.040
If I have--

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:38.890
COMPUTER: Less input.

01:01:38.890 --> 01:01:39.390
Type equal--

01:01:39.390 --> 01:01:41.056
VICTOR TSARAN: I'm
not gonna use quotes.

01:01:41.056 --> 01:01:42.350
I'll save myself a bit of time.

01:01:42.350 --> 01:01:46.010
Type equals text, and
blah, blah, blah--

01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:46.950
COMPUTER: Period.

01:01:46.950 --> 01:01:47.480
VICTOR TSARAN: I'm gonna say--

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:47.865
COMPUTER: Greater.

01:01:47.865 --> 01:01:48.780
VICTOR TSARAN: --there's
some kind of URL.

01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:50.300
COMPUTER: Left bracket.

01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:50.870
Greater.

01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:51.610
Left bracket.

01:01:51.610 --> 01:01:52.630
URL.

01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:53.460
Address.

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:54.550
Slash Less.

01:01:54.550 --> 01:01:55.550
VICTOR TSARAN: OK, cool.

01:01:55.550 --> 01:01:56.210
COMPUTER: New line.

01:01:56.210 --> 01:01:57.251
VICTOR TSARAN: Let it be.

01:01:57.251 --> 01:02:00.297
COMPUTER: Less-- y-- t--

01:02:00.297 --> 01:02:01.880
VICTOR TSARAN: So
what you can do is--

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:02.546
COMPUTER: Tango.

01:02:02.546 --> 01:02:05.680
VICTOR TSARAN: ARIA provides
you with a really cool attribute

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:06.760
called ARIA Label.

01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:08.790
COMPUTER: ARIA, dash.

01:02:08.790 --> 01:02:09.600
ARIA, dash, lab--

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:10.990
VICTOR TSARAN: Here I can say

01:02:10.990 --> 01:02:12.860
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:15.110
VICTOR TSARAN: So when the
screen reader notices this,

01:02:15.110 --> 01:02:18.920
it's gonna read it as
if it was a valid label.

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:21.043
So this is perfect
in situations where

01:02:21.043 --> 01:02:25.570
you know visually it's
so apparent that you're

01:02:25.570 --> 01:02:26.450
sharing the URL.

01:02:26.450 --> 01:02:27.840
It's like why do we even bother.

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:29.090
Right?

01:02:29.090 --> 01:02:31.656
But again, remember, you
can not always rely on that,

01:02:31.656 --> 01:02:34.650
so you have ARIA Label
attribute that you

01:02:34.650 --> 01:02:37.080
can use in this instance.

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:37.580
Yeah.

01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:39.508
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:47.710 --> 01:02:50.730
VICTOR TSARAN: Yeah,
this is a great question.

01:02:50.730 --> 01:02:52.440
Dragon, naturally
speaking, isn't

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:54.620
known to support
ARIA unfortunately,

01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:57.150
and we've been fighting
with them-- well,

01:02:57.150 --> 01:02:58.632
we, I can't say
that I have been,

01:02:58.632 --> 01:03:00.090
but the community
has been fighting

01:03:00.090 --> 01:03:01.631
with them because
unfortunately, they

01:03:01.631 --> 01:03:04.010
think of themselves--
well, unfortunately--

01:03:04.010 --> 01:03:06.610
they think of themselves
as a mainstream tool

01:03:06.610 --> 01:03:10.880
and as a result, yes, they are
an accessibility tool, assisted

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:12.930
technological tool, but
they don't go as far

01:03:12.930 --> 01:03:15.270
as supporting some of the
accessibility standards.

01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:17.760
So you wouldn't be able
to say click on URL

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.200
to share or something like that.

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:20.941
It wouldn't understand it.

01:03:20.941 --> 01:03:21.440
But--

01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:22.910
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:23.785
VICTOR TSARAN: Sorry?

01:03:23.785 --> 01:03:24.680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:26.346
VICTOR TSARAN: Well,
not me, personally,

01:03:26.346 --> 01:03:29.190
but there are people who
are hammering [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:31.130
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:34.602 --> 01:03:36.310
VICTOR TSARAN: No, it
has the same effect

01:03:36.310 --> 01:03:40.780
as the Label for tag.

01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:45.050
And by the way, the
problem with placeholders

01:03:45.050 --> 01:03:47.620
that there can be-- well, if
you use a placeholder the way

01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:49.950
it's supposed to be which
is use an HTML placeholder.

01:03:49.950 --> 01:03:51.070
Right?

01:03:51.070 --> 01:03:51.940
Then, it's OK.

01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:54.820
But if you use placeholder
as some people do,

01:03:54.820 --> 01:03:58.040
which will place a
text in the field

01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:01.210
and we think it's a
label, it's not advisory

01:04:01.210 --> 01:04:06.470
because the problem
is that when you

01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:10.010
move your focus into the field,
the label disappears usually.

01:04:10.010 --> 01:04:11.115
Right?

01:04:11.115 --> 01:04:12.740
Well, then that means
the screen reader

01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:16.741
isn't gonna know what's
the label of this field.

01:04:16.741 --> 01:04:17.240
Yeah.

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:18.930
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:18.930 --> 01:04:19.930
VICTOR TSARAN: OK, cool.

01:04:19.930 --> 01:04:21.604
So let me just
finish this widget,

01:04:21.604 --> 01:04:23.020
and then, we can
get to questions.

01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:23.520
OK?

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:24.330
Cool.

01:04:24.330 --> 01:04:26.420
COMPUTER: Space.

01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:27.620
Space.

01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:30.090
VICTOR TSARAN: I'm just
tabbing, by the way.

01:04:30.090 --> 01:04:30.854
Oh, wait.

01:04:30.854 --> 01:04:31.520
COMPUTER: Space.

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:31.780
Space.

01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:32.821
VICTOR TSARAN: Apologies.

01:04:34.257 --> 01:04:35.340
VICTOR TSARAN: My mistake.

01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:36.048

VICTOR TSARAN:
See, this is where

01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:44.860
it would get really
super confusing.

01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:47.420
So now, somebody's
going what is this.

01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:49.604
It's probably
something about time.

01:04:49.604 --> 01:04:51.020
You guys know what
it is visually.

01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:52.899
You know it's to start.

01:04:52.899 --> 01:04:55.440
This is, by the way, a really
cool feature, the coolest ever.

01:04:55.440 --> 01:05:00.600
I love this, and the fact you
can even look at it through API

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:02.390
is even super cool.

01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:04.320
Anyway--

01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:06.970

VICTOR TSARAN:
Share your thoughts,

01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:09.630
I guess it's like a div.

01:05:09.630 --> 01:05:10.421
Let's look at this.

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:24.034

01:05:54.670 --> 01:05:57.190
VICTOR TSARAN: Anyway,
you get the idea.

01:05:57.190 --> 01:05:59.490
So those are some of the
things, just to quickly

01:05:59.490 --> 01:06:01.607
summarize for you guys again.

01:06:01.607 --> 01:06:03.440
So the heading structure
you're doing really

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:06.320
well from what I've seen so far.

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:09.050
Remember about the
labels on form fields,

01:06:09.050 --> 01:06:10.600
on buttons, and
things like that.

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:14.140
We don't want to hear button,
button, button, button.

01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:16.690
Alt text-- if you don't
have enough information

01:06:16.690 --> 01:06:23.130
for the images, just use
alt equals empty quotes.

01:06:23.130 --> 01:06:25.105
Otherwise, provide
something meaningful.

01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:31.460
Drop downs and
expandable panels.

01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:32.170
Use ARIA.

01:06:32.170 --> 01:06:34.682
We have ARIA pop-up
and so on and so forth.

01:06:34.682 --> 01:06:36.390
This is probably a
separate conversation,

01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:43.460
but ARIA is very
powerful that way.

01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:49.190
And yeah, I think, then, we
can just get to questions.

01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:51.920
I did want to mention something
that I talked to Marcel about.

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:55.230
I noticed that you
guys are refreshing

01:06:55.230 --> 01:06:57.900
the content on some pages.

01:06:57.900 --> 01:07:01.670
The middle of the
page gets refreshed.

01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:03.310
That's causing some
really weird things

01:07:03.310 --> 01:07:07.397
because the keyboard focus
gets totally screwed up.

01:07:07.397 --> 01:07:08.980
Especially in Chrome,
for some reason,

01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:10.765
I see this more
than in Safari, is

01:07:10.765 --> 01:07:12.640
that I will be looking
at the list of videos,

01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:15.010
and then, suddenly, my
focus jumps somewhere else

01:07:15.010 --> 01:07:16.610
completely.

01:07:16.610 --> 01:07:20.197
So that's something maybe we
can talk after if you guys can

01:07:20.197 --> 01:07:21.655
get together for
lunch or whatever.

01:07:21.655 --> 01:07:23.290
We can chat about this.

01:07:23.290 --> 01:07:25.250
I see this is as one
of the big problems.

01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:26.737
Should we go to
questions quickly?

01:07:26.737 --> 01:07:28.695
MALE SPEAKER 3: Yeah,
have some questions here.

01:07:28.695 --> 01:07:34.529
One is regarding the
[INAUDIBLE] and also

01:07:34.529 --> 01:07:39.730
[INAUDIBLE] mobile [INAUDIBLE]
information [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:39.730 --> 01:07:40.990
VICTOR TSARAN: Yeah.

01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:41.780
OK.

01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:42.880
Those are great questions.

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:46.230
So the skip ad I
didn't get to, but it's

01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:48.740
one of things that actually
has [INAUDIBLE] annoying.

01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:52.500
So I tried to reproduce
it because-- yeah.

01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:54.980
But it was hard because every
time we'd go to a video,

01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:57.570
it's either different ad
or-- so if you guys have

01:07:57.570 --> 01:08:00.800
any reproducible
scenarios, I'd love

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:02.510
to be able to show this to you.

01:08:02.510 --> 01:08:05.610
So there are two issues
we have with skip ad.

01:08:05.610 --> 01:08:07.720
Number one, when
the ad is playing,

01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:09.720
there's actually
no keyboard control

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:13.060
that I was able to ever find
that lets me to actually skip

01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:14.620
the advertising.

01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:15.460
That's number one.

01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:17.751
So even if I knew that there's
actually a skip function

01:08:17.751 --> 01:08:19.710
item-- Number two,
I don't even know

01:08:19.710 --> 01:08:21.359
that functionality is available.

01:08:21.359 --> 01:08:23.069
Remember we talked
about discoverability,

01:08:23.069 --> 01:08:26.060
about keyboard shortcuts
and stuff like that?

01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:26.810
COMPUTER: TextMa--

01:08:26.810 --> 01:08:27.580
VICTOR TSARAN:
One little trick I

01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:29.930
want to show, but be
careful when using this.

01:08:29.930 --> 01:08:31.254
COMPUTER: New-- Less-- New--

01:08:31.254 --> 01:08:32.920
VICTOR TSARAN: So
what we have with ARIA

01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:35.330
is something called
Live Regions.

01:08:35.330 --> 01:08:39.100
So you can have a hidden
region on your page

01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:43.170
that when it gets updated,
could be automatically spoken

01:08:43.170 --> 01:08:44.750
to a screen reader.

01:08:44.750 --> 01:08:46.960
Sometimes, it can be used
on the live data which

01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:50.760
means the information that's
already on the screen.

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:52.370
Sometimes, you can
use it as a way

01:08:52.370 --> 01:08:55.240
to feed some information
to screen reader users.

01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:58.494
I prefer the former because
the few hidden things

01:08:58.494 --> 01:09:00.410
we have on the page, the
better for everybody.

01:09:00.410 --> 01:09:02.720
It's probably less work
for your QA people,

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:06.130
less work for translators
to figure out stuff.

01:09:06.130 --> 01:09:06.939
But here we go.

01:09:06.939 --> 01:09:08.599
So we have Live
ARIA Regions, so--

01:09:08.599 --> 01:09:09.390
COMPUTER: Less div.

01:09:09.390 --> 01:09:11.514
VICTOR TSARAN: --let's say
we have something like--

01:09:11.514 --> 01:09:13.130
COMPUTER: Id equals quote.

01:09:13.130 --> 01:09:14.380
Id equals quote.

01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:16.850
VICTOR TSARAN: I'm just
sort of speculating here,

01:09:16.850 --> 01:09:17.890
and let's say--

01:09:17.890 --> 01:09:21.109
COMPUTER: Less-- Less
slash-- Less-- Id equ--

01:09:21.109 --> 01:09:24.439
VICTOR TSARAN: We're gonna
to have here, when it's

01:09:24.439 --> 01:09:28.210
30 seconds into the ad, I'm
gonna pop in this screen

01:09:28.210 --> 01:09:29.899
it says--

01:09:29.899 --> 01:09:32.955
VICTOR TSARAN AND COMPUTER:
You can now skip this ad.

01:09:32.955 --> 01:09:34.830
VICTOR TSARAN: So the
problem, this is a div.

01:09:34.830 --> 01:09:35.100
Right?

01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:35.899
It's not focused.

01:09:35.899 --> 01:09:38.810
A screen reader doesn't
know of its existence.

01:09:38.810 --> 01:09:41.660
How did you tell the user
that this text has actually

01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:43.910
been just shown on the screen?

01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:46.130
One way we can do this is by--

01:09:46.130 --> 01:09:46.765
COMPUTER: Spa--

01:09:46.765 --> 01:09:49.140
VICTOR TSARAN: --using something
called ARIA Live Region.

01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:54.610
COMPUTER: ARIA-- ARIA dash.

01:09:54.610 --> 01:09:57.520
ARIA dash live equals space.

01:09:57.520 --> 01:09:59.830
VICTOR TSARAN: So there are
two types of Live Regions,

01:09:59.830 --> 01:10:01.310
polite and assertive.

01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:03.710
Polite will politely
wait until the user is

01:10:03.710 --> 01:10:05.540
done tabbing or
typing or whatever,

01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:06.700
and then, it's gonna speak.

01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:09.460
Assertive is totally rude.

01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:11.160
It's like I don't care.

01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:13.740
I have to tell this
to you right now.

01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:21.692
So perhaps, let's say,
if you were in a chat,

01:10:21.692 --> 01:10:23.900
you may not want to be
interrupting the user because,

01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:25.810
let's say, they are
typing the message,

01:10:25.810 --> 01:10:27.760
and they're listening to a
screen reader as they type.

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:28.260
Right?

01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:30.750
You don't want to be intruding.

01:10:30.750 --> 01:10:31.250
Right.

01:10:31.250 --> 01:10:33.220
So that could be one
of the best examples.

01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:35.136
So in this instance,
because the user probably

01:10:35.136 --> 01:10:38.070
is mostly listening, I think
it's OK to be assertive.

01:10:38.070 --> 01:10:41.510
And so one way to do this, you
could be injecting a stream

01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:44.210
here, and every
time you inject it,

01:10:44.210 --> 01:10:46.010
the screen reader
is gonna react.

01:10:46.010 --> 01:10:47.160
COMPUTER: Less input.

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:48.660
VICTOR TSARAN: Now,
Live Regions are

01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:52.060
a little bit interesting
beasts in that,

01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:54.120
depending on what screen
reader you're using,

01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:56.203
you may need to do a little
bit of hacking around.

01:10:56.203 --> 01:10:58.120
COMPUTER: Addr-- Right bracket.

01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:03.460
Less-- New-- Less div ARIA--
Greater, quote, great-- Space.

01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:06.220
VICTOR TSARAN:
Here's a good one.

01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:06.844
COMPUTER: Dash.

01:11:09.570 --> 01:11:10.180
Dash.

01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:10.850
Greater.

01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:12.660
VICTOR TSARAN:
Oops, I misspelled.

01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:13.930
[SPEAKING WHAT IS BEING TYPED]

01:11:23.415 --> 01:11:25.050
VICTOR TSARAN: ARIA
atomic is attribute

01:11:25.050 --> 01:11:29.215
that says no matter what,
update the Live Region.

01:11:29.215 --> 01:11:30.840
I don't want to lose
you at this point.

01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:33.090
All I wanted to show you
guys is that Live Regions can

01:11:33.090 --> 01:11:39.080
be used to communicate some
changes on the screen that

01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:41.250
happen, but for example,
the keyboard focus

01:11:41.250 --> 01:11:44.410
is not currently pointing at.

01:11:44.410 --> 01:11:46.330
You can also use,
instead of using--

01:11:46.330 --> 01:11:47.212
COMPUTER: Less input.

01:11:47.212 --> 01:11:49.170
VICTOR TSARAN: For example,
if you have model--

01:11:49.170 --> 01:11:50.260
COMPUTER: New li--

01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:51.110
VICTOR TSARAN: --model alert.

01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:52.485
You could also be
using something

01:11:52.485 --> 01:11:54.837
called ARIA role equals alert.

01:11:54.837 --> 01:11:55.670
COMPUTER: Role equ--

01:11:55.670 --> 01:11:57.836
VICTOR TSARAN: So you
basically place it on the div,

01:11:57.836 --> 01:12:01.700
and whenever there is alert
on the page, it'll say alert.

01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:03.610
It's time you go
get some coffee.

01:12:03.610 --> 01:12:07.230
You've been spending too much
time on YouTube or whatever.

01:12:07.230 --> 01:12:10.400
So ARIA provides you with all
these interesting attributes,

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:11.990
and you can look at this spec.

01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:15.010
I'm sure Marcel would be
a good person to talk to.

01:12:15.010 --> 01:12:17.620
You've spent some
time with ARIA before.

01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:18.670
There's a great spec.

01:12:18.670 --> 01:12:21.270
There's a lot of
stuff on the websites

01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:23.350
that shows you good
examples, but I

01:12:23.350 --> 01:12:25.250
think because YouTube
is so dynamic,

01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:27.540
you may find some
good applications.

01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:28.314
Be careful though.

01:12:28.314 --> 01:12:29.230
I do want to warn you.

01:12:29.230 --> 01:12:32.340
You can overdo
stuff, and that can

01:12:32.340 --> 01:12:34.440
have totally adverse results.

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:37.750
So as every tool, make sure
you know exactly what you're

01:12:37.750 --> 01:12:39.967
doing so that you
don't confuse the user.

01:12:39.967 --> 01:12:40.800
Any other questions?

01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:42.466
MALE SPEAKER 3: Yeah,
we have a question

01:12:42.466 --> 01:12:45.950
regarding auto-play [INAUDIBLE]

01:13:05.770 --> 01:13:07.866
VICTOR TSARAN: No,
no, so they-- yeah.

01:13:07.866 --> 01:13:09.240
It was actually
easier than that.

01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:11.530
Because they did it off
screen, so the message

01:13:11.530 --> 01:13:13.363
they put up-- let me
just show you actually.

01:13:13.363 --> 01:13:14.110
COMPUTER: Safari.

01:13:14.110 --> 01:13:14.900
Safari.

01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:16.580
VICTOR TSARAN: I
don't know actually--

01:13:16.580 --> 01:13:17.740
COMPUTER: New tab.

01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:19.220
Search Google.

01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:23.439
M-- Twitter page has
20 links, two headings.

01:13:23.439 --> 01:13:24.480
VICTOR TSARAN: Let's see.

01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:25.910
If I go to the
top of this page--

01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:26.410
[ALERT]

01:13:26.410 --> 01:13:27.220

01:13:29.070 --> 01:13:30.486
VICTOR TSARAN: No,
it didn't work.

01:13:30.486 --> 01:13:31.900
I think it remembers me.

01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:35.310
What they do, they put a tax,
but they make it invisible.

01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:38.040
So they use a negative
pixel positioning,

01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:40.264
or they use a clip property.

01:13:40.264 --> 01:13:42.180
You put a text on the
page, and then, you just

01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:47.440
do clip rectangle one
pixel in all four corners.

01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:51.530
And so if you're not
using a screen reader,

01:13:51.530 --> 01:13:54.160
you're not gonna
even know it's there.

01:13:54.160 --> 01:14:00.320
So if you use Flash-- which I
hope you don't-- unfortunately,

01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:03.320
we don't have an easy way
to detect screen readers

01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:06.330
in the browser at this point.

01:14:06.330 --> 01:14:08.820
There was a way of
doing it through Flash,

01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:12.710
but as Flash is going away,
we don't have that feature

01:14:12.710 --> 01:14:13.210
anymore.

01:14:13.210 --> 01:14:15.780
So I don't exactly know.

01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:18.360
One way that somebody suggested
to me on Twitter today

01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:20.420
in the morning is that
if there was a setting

01:14:20.420 --> 01:14:23.470
that the user could go to
and just check a check box,

01:14:23.470 --> 01:14:26.970
play video automatically,
that would be kind of cool.

01:14:26.970 --> 01:14:31.220
So this way, you don't
get your business folks

01:14:31.220 --> 01:14:33.950
upset, but at the same
time, the users who

01:14:33.950 --> 01:14:35.410
know that there
is a setting, they

01:14:35.410 --> 01:14:37.460
could just go in and
check the check box.

01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:38.980
And from then on,
they're not gonna

01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:41.187
have their video
playing automatically.

01:14:41.187 --> 01:14:43.175
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:14:47.182 --> 01:14:48.015
VICTOR TSARAN: What?

01:14:48.015 --> 01:14:49.850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:14:57.625 --> 01:14:58.500
VICTOR TSARAN: Right.

01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:01.350
No, I totally
understand, but what if--

01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:03.273
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:09.095 --> 01:15:10.220
VICTOR TSARAN: It could be.

01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:11.100
Then, you have to
make sure you're

01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:12.100
write it for all browsers.

01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:12.599
Right?

01:15:12.599 --> 01:15:15.390
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:15.390 --> 01:15:19.080
VICTOR TSARAN: So I was
thinking the setting could be--

01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:20.627
but they don't even
want people to be

01:15:20.627 --> 01:15:21.835
able to turn off the feature.

01:15:21.835 --> 01:15:23.046
Right?

01:15:23.046 --> 01:15:25.410
But what if it could
be another analytics?

01:15:25.410 --> 01:15:27.421
How many people actually
turn on the video?

01:15:27.421 --> 01:15:27.920
Right?

01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:29.586
So you could think
of it that way, but--

01:15:29.586 --> 01:15:31.524
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:46.050
VICTOR TSARAN: No, those are
great discussions to have.

01:15:46.050 --> 01:15:49.262
I'm not trying to-- Look, I
work for business-- I totally

01:15:49.262 --> 01:15:51.220
understand the priorities
and things like that,

01:15:51.220 --> 01:15:53.170
but I just bring it
to your attention

01:15:53.170 --> 01:15:56.240
that this is a
concern among users.

01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:58.880
Well, the way
VoiceOver on Mac OS

01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:01.160
solved this problem was
actually pretty smart.

01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:04.450
They have this feature
called Audio Docking, and--

01:16:04.450 --> 01:16:05.300

01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:23.260
VICTOR TSARAN: So you
notice what happens.

01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:23.810
Right?

01:16:23.810 --> 01:16:25.400
When the video is
playing, the voice

01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:28.810
over ducks down the video,
so that the user can still

01:16:28.810 --> 01:16:29.850
hear the screen reader.

01:16:29.850 --> 01:16:32.500
I think it's a pretty
clever solution, personally.

01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:36.320
I don't actually know
why others-- and they

01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:40.120
do the same on the iPhone.

01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:42.760
If you're using a Mac,
it's really not that bad,

01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:45.110
but if you're using
Windows, then I

01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:47.470
could see why people
could be upset.

01:16:49.657 --> 01:16:51.740
I'll leave it up you to
decide what to do with it.

01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:55.090
I just thought I'd
communicate the problem.

01:16:55.090 --> 01:16:58.040
Anyway, anything else?

01:16:58.040 --> 01:16:58.670
We're done.

01:16:58.670 --> 01:17:00.940
Right?

01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:02.500
So I guess if I
have to leave you

01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:07.270
with one thing it's that I
know it's a little scary.

01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:09.770
Every time you ask
developers to go and try

01:17:09.770 --> 01:17:11.710
with a screen reader,
people go, oh, what can

01:17:11.710 --> 01:17:13.520
I do so I don't have to do it.

01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:14.490
Right?

01:17:14.490 --> 01:17:17.110
But honestly, it will open
your eyes to many things

01:17:17.110 --> 01:17:20.310
that you thought you developed
really well, and so just

01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:24.480
going through the
experience, it's

01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:26.480
gonna help you just to
discover a lot of things,

01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:30.480
not just about accessibility,
but just overall.

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:32.250
Imagine yourself
using the keyboard.

01:17:32.250 --> 01:17:35.820
So I would suggest, if you can,
spend 10 minutes, 15 minutes,

01:17:35.820 --> 01:17:38.460
just going through
the interface.

01:17:38.460 --> 01:17:40.500
And just make it into a
habit, and that's just

01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:42.020
gonna make you a
better programmer

01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:47.940
and bring you a little closer
to how users who are blind,

01:17:47.940 --> 01:17:50.994
specifically, use your
particular product.

01:17:52.090 --> 01:17:53.090
VICTOR TSARAN: Oh, yeah.

01:17:53.090 --> 01:17:54.200
So-- Yeah, OK.

01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:55.990
So this is the one
I'm using here.

01:17:55.990 --> 01:17:56.960
It's called VoiceOver.

01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:58.380
It's built into every Mac.

01:17:58.380 --> 01:18:01.310
If you press Command-5--

01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:03.960
COMPUTER: VoiceOver off.

01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:04.960
VoiceOver on.

01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:06.570
Safari.

01:18:06.570 --> 01:18:09.470
VICTOR TSARAN: It's built
in, so that's really--

01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:10.780
you get it for free.

01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:15.370
If you're testing on Windows,
there's a project called NVDA ,

01:18:15.370 --> 01:18:18.829
NVDA, which is an open
source screen readers,

01:18:18.829 --> 01:18:20.370
so that's gonna take
care of Windows.

01:18:20.370 --> 01:18:25.440
And of course, you
do have Chromebox

01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:28.680
in Chrome, which
is also a solution.

01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:31.440
I know Marcel told
me that there is

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:33.330
a little bit of a
concern among developers

01:18:33.330 --> 01:18:37.960
that you have to learn
how screen readers work.

01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:42.600
There is a bit of truth in that
which is you do kind of need

01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:43.720
to know how it operates.

01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:45.803
For example, remember I
mentioned at the beginning

01:18:45.803 --> 01:18:50.260
that tabbing is not
the only thing you

01:18:50.260 --> 01:18:51.746
need to do with a screen reader.

01:18:51.746 --> 01:18:54.120
But honestly speaking, there
are only a few shortcut keys

01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:56.770
you need to know to be
able to be effective.

01:18:56.770 --> 01:18:58.370
So remember I showed
you this feature?

01:18:58.370 --> 01:18:59.860
COMPUTER: Images.

01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:02.870
VICTOR TSARAN: It's
called web rotor.

01:19:02.870 --> 01:19:04.370
I can never pronounce
this properly.

01:19:04.370 --> 01:19:04.950
Bleh.

01:19:04.950 --> 01:19:08.120
This word, R-O-T-O-R.
And basically,

01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:12.770
when a screen reader is running,
if I press Command-Option-u,

01:19:12.770 --> 01:19:15.340
this opens up, and look.

01:19:15.340 --> 01:19:17.560
This is a quick-- right
there you can already

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:18.620
see what's going on here.

01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:19.120
Right?

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:20.703
And then use left
and right arrow keys

01:19:20.703 --> 01:19:22.460
to switch between
different categories.

why you have 500 links?

01:20:00.710 --> 01:20:02.270
It's because actually
I think there's

01:20:02.270 --> 01:20:03.978
some things on the

01:20:03.978 --> 01:20:06.250

Maybe my thinking is screwed
up, but I don't quite

01:20:11.550 --> 01:20:12.800
see why this should be a link.

01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:15.569
I mean, I know you want to
make everything clickable.

01:20:15.569 --> 01:20:16.610
That's probably the idea.

01:20:16.610 --> 01:20:17.360
Is that correct?

01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:35.280
COMPUTER: Button.

01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:35.930
Button.

01:20:35.930 --> 01:20:37.630
Search button.

01:20:37.630 --> 01:20:41.000
VICTOR TSARAN: So just using
even this particular feature,

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.430
you can quickly see
how well your page is

01:20:43.430 --> 01:20:45.300
doing with the voice over.

01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:47.942
And so this is just one
shortcut, Control-option-u.

01:20:47.942 --> 01:20:48.650
COMPUTER: Button.

01:20:48.650 --> 01:20:50.450
VICTOR TSARAN: But I'd
be happy to follow up

01:20:50.450 --> 01:20:51.340
with a couple of links.

01:20:51.340 --> 01:20:52.714
I'll make sure
Marcel to send you

01:20:52.714 --> 01:20:55.720
a couple of links, some
quick guides on how

01:20:55.720 --> 01:20:57.000
to use a screen reader.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:00.890
I would encourage you,
don't stress too much.

01:21:00.890 --> 01:21:02.830
Learn one or two
things about the screen

01:21:02.830 --> 01:21:04.470
reader, and rely on those.

01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:06.760
The point is not to make
you into experienced users.

01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:09.270
The point is for you
to be able to feel

01:21:09.270 --> 01:21:13.210
comfortable with the tool enough
so you can test for yourself.

01:21:13.210 --> 01:21:14.870
OK?

01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:16.840
Thanks so much, and I
hope I'll get a change

01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:18.593
to talk to some
of you afterwards.

01:21:18.593 --> 01:21:20.565
[APPLAUSE]

01:21:24.016 --> 01:21:27.467
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

01:21:41.637 --> 01:21:42.470
VICTOR TSARAN: Yeah.

01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:44.370
In the Google
accessibility, there's

01:21:44.370 --> 01:21:47.417
a lot of really cool guys, so
you're gonna have lots of fun.

01:21:51.890 --> 01:21:53.637
Thanks a lot.
