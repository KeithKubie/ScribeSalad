00:00:01.376 --> 00:00:05.880
NARRATOR: Auckland,

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.051
Retired military and commercial
airline pilot, Bruce Cathie,

00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:14.431
publishes his book,
"The Energy Grid."

00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:17.475
In it, he details his
experience observing

00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:23.481
refers during his time working
for the New Zealand military.

00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:25.984
He noted that these
crafts were always

00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:28.737
following straight lines.

00:00:28.737 --> 00:00:31.656
After mapping them, he
discovered that they followed

00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:35.326
a distinctive grid pattern.

00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:38.747
Additionally, while flying
over some of these zones,

00:00:38.747 --> 00:00:41.791
he also noticed that various
structures were actively

00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:45.712
being built along the paths.

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:47.756
DAVID CHILDRESS: Bruce
Cathie maintained

00:00:47.756 --> 00:00:51.468
that the American military,
starting in World War II,

00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:55.513
had also figured out
this special grid that

00:00:55.513 --> 00:00:58.391
surrounds the entire planet.

00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:01.478
And that the military
was using certain spots

00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:04.731
on the earth to build military
bases and other structures.

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:12.071
NARRATOR: Cathy suggested that
the extraterrestrial craft

00:01:12.071 --> 00:01:14.991
may have been drawing
power off the grid.

00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:18.495
And that after World War II
and the Roswell incident,

00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:21.080
military personnel
around the world

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.001
had become aware of
this UFO connection.

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:29.589
DAVID CHILDRESS: So here we
have an ancient grid structure,

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:33.885
probably built by
extraterrestrials, possibly

00:01:33.885 --> 00:01:40.975
to power their craft that's
now being reconstructed today

00:01:40.975 --> 00:01:42.185
by the military.

00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:48.733
NARRATOR: Could it be
that ancient structures

00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:50.819
throughout the
world were designed

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:56.407
to function together as part
of a massive energy grid?

00:01:56.407 --> 00:01:58.701
And did the architects
intentionally leave

00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:01.412
behind information
for us to find

00:02:01.412 --> 00:02:03.873
once we had the
technological knowledge

00:02:03.873 --> 00:02:06.251
to recognize the system?

00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:08.545
But why?

00:02:08.545 --> 00:02:13.842
What were the alien
architects trying to tell us?

00:02:13.842 --> 00:02:15.385
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS:
Extraterrestrials

00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:18.054
knew that at some
point in our evolution,

00:02:18.054 --> 00:02:22.267
a technologically advanced
society would stumble

00:02:22.267 --> 00:02:25.228
across all of
these ancient sites

00:02:25.228 --> 00:02:31.276
and see their correlation,
thus forcing us to take

00:02:31.276 --> 00:02:35.697
into consideration that some
type of extraterrestrials

00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:40.493
showed our ancestors where
to build these things, not

00:02:40.493 --> 00:02:44.956
for them, but for us.

00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:47.792
DAVID WILCOX: The grid
itself may, in fact,

00:02:47.792 --> 00:02:50.628
be a source of
unconventional energy

00:02:50.628 --> 00:02:54.632
that we are not necessarily
utilizing with our technology

00:02:54.632 --> 00:02:56.301
now.

00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:59.012
And advanced, intelligent
race wanted to leave something

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:01.514
behind for us to
discover that would give

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:04.267
us the clues to a
greater level of science

00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:06.686
than we now understand.

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:09.647
WILLIAM HENRY: It could be that
this master architect sought

00:03:09.647 --> 00:03:12.650
not only to influence
the earth, but also

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.277
to connect the
earth to something

00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:17.447
greater or beyond
our imagination.

00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:21.034
Perhaps this grid even
extends out into the stars

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:23.995
and the world grid of the
earth connects with the grip

00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:26.164
of other planets as well.

00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:29.959
And that integrates the
Earth into a huge colony,

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:30.960
if you will, or integrated
circuit throughout the cosmos.
